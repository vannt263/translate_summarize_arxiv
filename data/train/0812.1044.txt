    "the phase transition of strongly interacting matter has been intensively studied for many years . as early as 1960s ,",
    "before the discovery of qcd , there was speculation about a possible new phase of strongly interacting matter , based on studies of the thermodynamics of a hadron gas .",
    "particularly , in the statistical bootstrap model  @xcite , the asymptotically exponential mass spectrum of hadrons implied the existence of a limiting temperature of about @xmath0  mev ( the hagedorn temperature ) above which hadrons can not exist .    after the discovery of qcd and in particular asymptotic freedom , the discussion focused on the ideas of a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , a system of weakly interacting quarks and gluons , and a possible transition between a pion gas and a quark gluon plasma .",
    "the physical picture for such a transition was that at the critical temperature the additional degrees of freedom carried by the quarks and gluons would be released leading to a rapid increase of the entropy , energy - density and pressure .",
    "this was supported by first lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculations  @xcite . lately , however , the hadron resonance gas experienced a renaissance mainly due to its successful description of hadron yields in heavy ion and also elementary particle collisions  @xcite .",
    "in addition it was realized that the sharp rise of the entropy density near the transition temperature , as observed in lattice qcd calculations , could be accounted for by a hadron resonance gas as well  @xcite .",
    "the success of the hadron resonance gas below the transition temperature @xmath1 , however , changes the physical interpretation for the qcd phase transition . instead of releasing additional degrees of freedom at @xmath1 ,",
    "the system has to reduce the number of active degrees of freedom at the transition temperature , because a hadron gas has many more than a quark gluon plasma . in case of a hagedorn exponential mass spectrum",
    ", the entropy density actually diverges at the hagedorn temperature .",
    "but even if the number of hadrons is restricted to those needed for a successful description of hadronic final states in heavy ion and elementary particle collisions , the entropy quickly exceeds that observed on the lattice .",
    "meanwhile many papers have addressed this issue ranging from qcd - based approaches ( see for example  @xcite ) to various generalizations of the hadron gas  @xcite . in this article",
    "we will study the transition region , and we will provide a simple and intuitive modification to the hadron gas model in order to qualitatively reproduce the crossover transition observed in lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "our calculations are based on the ideas proposed in  @xcite , where it was shown that under certain circumstances a gas of extended hadrons could produce phase transitions of the first or second order , and also a smooth crossover transition that might be qualitatively similar to that of lattice qcd .",
    "we first observe that for the typical particle density at the transition the size of hadrons needs to be taken into account as it leads to a considerable suppression of the available phase space . as a result",
    "the number of effective degrees of freedom is reduced .",
    "this suppression alone , however , does not explain the ideal gas behavior of lattice qcd at high temperatures , above @xmath1 .",
    "additional model assumptions have to be made .",
    "for example one could explicitly introduce a deconfined phase and then match the two different phases .",
    "for this exercise to work , however , rather detailed assumptions about the intrinsic nature of hadrons have to be made in order to avoid the occurrence of an actual phase transition  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we follow a different route .",
    "we adopt the philosophy that the same partition function should describe both `` phases '' . to this end",
    "we need to introduce appropriate dynamics in order to model the crossover observed on the lattice .",
    "this approach is similar in spirit to  @xcite .",
    "we find that the mit bag model  @xcite of the hadrons is well suited for our purposes , because it embodies confined and deconfined phases from the very beginning .",
    "thus , we will describe hadrons as extended bags of qgp and we will assume an infinite mass spectrum of the hagedorn s type .",
    "the additional dynamics needed to describe the transition are simply the elastic interactions between hadrons .",
    "they give rise to a _",
    "kinetic _ pressure that in turn `` squeezes '' the bag - like hadrons .",
    "we find that the behavior of our system depends sensitively on the choice of parameters for the mass spectrum .",
    "one can obtain either a real phase transition  @xcite or , as we shall show , a crossover .",
    "in addition , in the latter case the specific parametrization for the mass spectrum affects the microscopic structure of the gas of `` compressible '' hadrons at high temperatures ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "one finds either a high temperature phase that is populated by one or few infinitely large bags , consistent with the usual picture of a qgp . or",
    ", for a different choice of parameters , one obtains a system of many , densely packed heavy hadrons , which nonetheless exhibit the thermodynamic properties of a qgp of massless quarks and gluons .    on first sight",
    ", our approach appears to be similar to the ideas of percolation models  @xcite .",
    "the finite size corrections to the statistical ensemble remove all the configurations with overlapping hadrons , resulting in large hadronic states dominating the partition function .",
    "this is similar to percolation .",
    "however , there are quite some differences in the specific implementation .",
    "first , in our model , we do not consider an explicit coupling between the bags as it is done in the percolation model of @xcite .",
    "instead , we take the effect of the kinetic pressure onto the bag sizes into account , resulting in a self - consistency relation for the effective bag pressure . this is more in the spirit of a mean field description , although we do not introduce an additional interaction but simply consider the kinetic pressure .",
    "second , in contrast to purely geometric percolation , in our model the number of hadrons and their sizes are not independent quantities . in a given multihadron state ,",
    "melting two or more hadrons together ( to form a bigger one ) results in a different kinetic pressure and , in turn , in the rearrangement of the sizes of all the hadrons .    throughout this paper",
    ", we will maintain a simple schematic approach to highlight the main features of the model leaving a more detailed quantitative analysis and further generalizations to future work .",
    "we will confine ourselves to the simplest case of nonrelativistic boltzmann particles and we will neglect subtleties such as surface effects and van der waals type residual interaction among the bags .    this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ pf ] we introduce the main ideas of the model and derive the grand - canonical partition function for the gas of compressible hadrons . in section  [ isobpf ]",
    "we will use the corresponding isobaric partition function to perform a comprehensive numerical analysis .",
    "we will study the pressure , the energy density and the entropy density of the system .",
    "we will further analyze particles number , the filling fraction and the average mass of particles in the system .",
    "in this section we will set up the general formalism for our model .",
    "let us start with the partition function @xmath3 of an ideal gas of boltzmann particles of mass @xmath4 and degeneracy @xmath5 in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "for the subsequent discussion it is advantageous to express the partition function @xmath3 in a multiplicity expansion , i.e. as a sum of partition functions @xmath6 for fixed particle numbers @xmath7 : @xmath8 with @xmath9}= \\exp{\\left[-\\frac{m}{t}\\right ] } \\left(\\frac{m t}{2 \\pi}\\right)^{3/2}\\ ; . \\label{1.2}\\ ] ] here @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the volume and the temperature of the system , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath12 is the _ grand - canonical _ partition function with vanishing chemical potentials . in the context of this paper",
    "we shall refer to @xmath13 as the _ canonical _ partition function keeping in mind that this notation deviates from the conventions for relativistic hadron gases , where the canonical ensemble has fixed abelian charges ( such as electric charge , strangeness , baryon number ) , but no constraints on the number of particles .",
    "( [ 1.1 ] ) can be easily generalized to a multispecies gas of particles .",
    "if we label with @xmath14 the various particle species we have : @xmath15 = \\exp{\\left[v \\sum_{j=1}^{k } g_j \\phi(m_j , t)\\right]}\\ ; . \\label{1.3}\\ ] ] in case of @xmath16 , it is convenient to replace the discrete index @xmath17 with a continuous spectrum density @xmath18 so that the number of species in the mass interval @xmath19 $ ] is given by @xmath20 . formally , we make the substitution : @xmath21 by expanding the exponential in eq .",
    "( [ 1.3 ] ) the partition function can then be written as : @xmath22 \\ ; . \\label{1.5}\\ ] ] because a hadron gas , or , more precisely , a hagedorn gas is characterized by an exponential mass spectrum , we set @xmath23 where the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 will be determined from empirical data . in the case of gas - of - bags models , which also have an exponential mass spectrum , the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 will have to be determined from the underlying ( dynamical ) model parameters , such as bag pressure , and so on . we note that @xmath24 has dimensions of @xmath26^{\\alpha-1}$ ] and @xmath25 typically ranges from @xmath27 to @xmath28 depending on the model . in eq .",
    "( [ 1.7 ] ) , @xmath29 simply parametrizes the mass spectrum . in the context of the mit bag model",
    ", @xmath29 can be interpreted as the effective `` temperature '' inside the bag , as will be discussed in section [ rpf ] . by substituting eq .",
    "( [ 1.7 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ 1.5 ] ) we arrive at the following partition function for a hadron gas @xmath30 \\\\ \\nonumber & & \\times   \\exp{\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i}{t_0}-\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i}{t}\\right ] } \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this partition function @xmath3 ( and also @xmath6 ) is divergent for @xmath31 as already pointed out by hagedorn .",
    "although an upper limit in the mass spectrum @xmath18 regulates the divergences , it will not prevent the system from having a much higher entropy density than that observed on the lattice .",
    "an exponential mass spectrum without any cutoff may certainly be an oversimplification and a more realistic calculation may take into account discrete states as well as a mass spectrum that grows less than exponential above a certain mass .",
    "however , empirically the known hadronic states do indeed grow exponentially up to a mass of @xmath32 . above that , very few states are known and it is not clear if this is an indication of a saturating density of states or simply the lack of experimental data on higher mass resonances .",
    "therefore , working with an exponential mass spectrum without any cutoff appears to be an approximation as good as any other .",
    "furthermore , because we are interested only in bulk thermodynamic quantities such as energy density and pressure , the use of a continuous mass spectrum should be a reasonable approximation as all these quantities represent integrals / sums over the mass spectrum .",
    "therefore , in this paper we will assume that the mass spectrum is of the hagedorn type and will discuss a dynamical scenario in the framework of the mit bag model , which will regulate the partition function .",
    "to develop the partition function of our model , we need to recall some of the basic features of the mit bag model  @xcite . in its simplest formulation",
    ", hadrons can be considered as _",
    "bags _ of partonic fields confined in a spatial region with a constant potential energy per unit volume @xmath33 , where @xmath33 is commonly referred as the bag constant or bag pressure . the total energy , i.e. the mass @xmath4 of a bag with volume @xmath34 is then given by  @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the internal energy of the field inside the bag . when its linear extension is larger than the wavelengths of the partons ( the quanta of the inner field ) , we can approximate the bag by a gas of free massless particles confined to its volume  @xcite . for a sufficiently large @xmath34 ,",
    "the internal energy is then given by the relation : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the pressure of the gas .",

    "( [ 1.7 ] ) and we will analyze different values of @xmath25 . of course , eq .",

    "once the temperature @xmath11 of the gas of bags approaches @xmath29 , the average masses and hence the volume ( see eq .",
    "( [ massbagm ] ) ) of the bags grow very fast . therefore",
    ", the bag - like hadrons tend to occupy more and more of the available space and , eventually , they will overlap . to avoid multiple counting of the phase space ,",
    "configurations with overlapping bags need to be excluded from the partition function . for a finite system of volume @xmath10",

    "( [ massbagm ] ) ) .",
    "the underlying reason for this behavior is that the system is not able to pick up additional kinetic energy once the entire volume is filled with bags , as the bags have no more room to move .",
    "obviously some additional dynamics needs to be included to allow for the system to pick up more energy as the temperature is increased .",
    "to this end we adopt the idea of compressible bags  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we will allow the volume of the hadrons to vary under the effect of the pressure generated by their own thermal motion in a self - consistent way .",
    "consequently , as the temperature and hence the pressure increase , the bags will be compressed and acquire a higher internal mass / energy density .",
    "we will show that the system does not exhibit any limiting value of the energy density , and , under appropriate conditions , exhibits the desired increase of the energy density and entropy .    to illustrate the underlying mechanism ,",
    "let us consider a gas of many hadrons . for small temperatures , @xmath59 ,",
