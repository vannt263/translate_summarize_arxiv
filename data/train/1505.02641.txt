    "light harvesting complexes in plants and bacteria , as well as visual systems in animals , are typically arrays of chromophores organized spatially and held in place by proteins ( see recent review articles @xcite,@xcite and references there ) . they absorb photons and transfer the excitation energy over distances as great as several nanometers with high quantum efficiency , estimated at 67% in the mammalian visual system , and up to 90% in the photosynthesis of higher plants .",
    "no artificial solar cell approaches these values .",
    "biological systems achieve these values not just through being nanoscale , but also through being ultrafast , much faster than corresponding radiative lifetimes and other dissipative mechanisms .",
    "the isomerization of retinal in rhodopsin , the first step in vision , is one of the fastest photochemical reactions known , complete in 200 fs .",
    "a similar sub - picosecond timescale characterizes the first energy transfers in photosynthesis .",
    "understanding these fast energy pathways is a subject of intensive current research .    in principle",
    "the chain of events following photoabsorption could be just incoherent transitions from one excited state to another , passing energy to a reaction center ( rc ) in photosynthesis , or to a new conformation of rhodopsin in vision .",
    "the speed of these processes , however , together with the experimental observation of coherences among some intermediate states , has prompted the investigation of coherent , quantum mechanical evolution of the excited states as a contributing mechanism .",
    "these investigations have even raised fundamental issues of quantum mechanics , suggesting that coherent energy transfer could be a kind of quantum computer , finding the best path by , in effect , trying all of them simultaneously @xcite , or questioning whether coherent mechanisms seen in the laboratory have any relevance to performance under incoherent illumination by sunlight @xcite .",
    "the decay of coherence through interaction with the environment is relevant to such questions , and has been modeled by hamiltonians that include interaction of the electronic state with ` phonons , ' vibrational modes of the molecules , reviewed in @xcite .",
    "this paper calls attention to an energy transfer mechanism that has not been part of the discussion .",
    "the excitonic state of a chromophore itself has a kind of phonon - like quality , even in the absence of nuclear motion , manifesting itself as an oscillating fermi pressure . by steric interaction with a neighboring molecule ,",
    "this oscillating pressure can do work and transfer energy .",
    "an essential feature of the model is that each molecule sees each neighboring molecule as a wall , in the sense of classical mechanics , into which it can not penetrate .",
    "( the reason for this is the pauli principle , but the quantum mechanical origin of this excluded space is otherwise irrelevant to the molecular quantum states . ) the motion of the wall , being a collective motion of the molecular electrons , will be essentially classical . in the model that we compute , the walls , considered as classical oscillators , have a natural frequency much lower than the exciton resonance frequency ,",
    "another reason that their motion should be considered classical .",
    "the oscillating pressure , on the other hand , is entirely of quantum mechanical origin , as the beating of the molecular excited state with the ground state in a coherent superposition .",
    "biological systems do not suggest any particular geometry for light harvesting antennae beyond the close proximity of chromophores and proteins .",
    "accordingly we choose the simplest possible geometry to test the concept , in what is surely the simplest possible model of electronic excitation coupled to steric interaction in this way .",
    "it is exactly solvable in the time domain by numerical integration of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the model is not proposed as a realistic geometry for an actual process , but only as a schematic way of thinking about a process that undoubtedly does occur at some level .",
    "we are not doing molecular modeling , but rather a much more primitive thing , investigating whether the proposed mechanism could be significant under any circumstances , and might therefore be worth detailed consideration in more realistic geometries .    the model is a chain of 1-dimensional boxes , each box representing a single chromophore .",
    "the relevant electronic states are quantum mechanical box states , where we allow the box to fluctuate in size , subject to the fermi pressure of the electrons .",
    "the walls of the boxes represent the boundaries between chromophores , with masses assumed to be tens or hundreds of electron masses . in this way one box can push on the next , compressing it and raising its energy levels , or perhaps inducing quantum transitions .",
    "the mechanism is non - coulombic , and universal in the sense that it is not constrained by selection rules .",
    "in particular it would work the same way for both optically allowed and optically forbidden states , if we included enough molecular detail to make that distinction .",
    "a computation shows that energy can be tranferred from box to box by this process , and in an unexpected way .",
    "as we show by computation , there is an instability in this system that allows the growth of fluctuations in fermi pressure to feed on itself and grow to dominate the time development , creating a self - induced energy transfer transparency through the system . for comparison",
    "we include also energy transfer by the familiar frster resonance mechanism , and find that , within this model , the fermi pressure mechanism can be of comparable importance .",

    "the coefficients of @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be interpreted as the pressures at the left and right walls respectively .",
    "it is exactly the fluctuating component of these pressures that will be responsible for the energy transfer in the model that we compute .",
    "the time development of multielectron states can be described by regarding eqs .",
    "( [ se3 ] ) and ( [ se3hat ] ) as equations for the evolution of fermionic operators ( we develop this point in more detail in section [ op ] ) .",
    "the ground state of a box with @xmath36 electrons would then be @xmath37 and one of the ( doubly degenerate ) first excited states would be @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the empty box , and where the electron spin ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) plays no essential role in what follows and will be largely ignored . restricting attention to just the transition between these two states ( homo - lumo transition ) , and suppressing the subscript for spin , we have the time - dependent schrdinger equation in the form @xmath42 or equivalently , in the interaction picture , @xmath43 the time evolution of @xmath44 is still given by eq .",

    "if the box is squeezed symmetrically ( @xmath45 ) , no transition is excited , but the energy goes up .",
    "it is amusing to note that if the box is shaken rigidly ( @xmath46 ) at the frequency @xmath47 rabi oscillations are excited , i.e. , oscillations in the amplitudes of the two - level system at a frequency proportional to the amplitude of the resonant driving force .",

    "if there are j boxes , the hilbert space of states is the j - fold tensor product of the hilbert space for a single box .",
    "the dynamics is just that of the formalism already described , but with subscripts on all quantities labeling which box they belong to .",
    "we assume no tunneling between boxes ( i.e. , the wave functions vanish at l and r as before ) .",
    "the dynamics takes place independently in each box , and does not , for example , lead to entanglement of the states , but the systems may be coupled through the motions of the walls . in particular , the case we shall consider , the boxes may be concatenated together , so that @xmath52 .",

    "we also enlarge the dynamical system to include the moveable walls at @xmath55 , while keeping @xmath56 and @xmath57 fixed .",
    "we treat the moveable walls classically , giving them masses @xmath58 sufficiently large , and imagine that the relevant forces on them are just the pressures due to the delocalized electrons of the previous section , i.e. @xmath59 there is a conserved energy in this system , @xmath60 useful for checking correctness of numerical computations .    in light harvesting complexes",
    "the resonant frequencies ( the energy scale ) of the observable optical transitions typically decrease in the direction that the excitation energy follows to the rc .",
    "it was once suggested that this amounted to a kind of  energy funnel , \" but the funnel is not unidirectional , according to more recent ideas : the photosynthetic complex may be more like a reservoir in which the captured energy is distributed @xcite .",
    "we can build such a structure into the chain of j boxes by choosing effective electron masses @xmath61 that increase slightly in the direction that we expect the energy to flow .",
    "this alters the energy levels so that they are not initially in resonance , creating the situation that we had set out to investigate .",

    "their transitions are not in resonance , however , because resonance between box @xmath64 and box @xmath65 requires @xmath66 with box @xmath64 slightly more compressed than it is in mechanical equilibrium .",
    "the following scenario motivated the computation .",
    "taking the equilibrium state as the starting point ,",
    "imagine that box 1 is suddenly placed into its excited state by absorption of a photon .",
    "the pressure is now higher in box 1 , so that box 2 begins to be compressed . at sufficient compression box 2",
    "comes into resonance with box 1 , and its excited state is populated by the oscillating pressure through a rabi transition .",
    "as the pressure in box 2 increases , box 3 begins to be compressed , etc . , passing the excitation along the chain .",
    "computation shows that something like this happens , but also that the classical intuition is not completely correct .",
    "rather , low frequency oscillations of the walls , induced by the initial photoabsorption , bring the boxes in and out of resonance .",
    "in the assumed pure starting states the pressure in each box is nearly constant , and transitions are driven only weakly , even during the resonances . as the states gradually become coherent superpositions of excited and ground states , an instability is reached in which the rapidly oscillating pressure , growing in amplitude , takes over the time development , and energy is then rapidly transferred through the whole complex .",
    "this section elaborates on the operator formalism suggested in section [ 2nelectrons ] .",
    "the fermionic operators @xmath24 and their adjoints obey canonical anticommutation relations @xmath67 the empty box state obeys @xmath68 ( and similarly for the operators @xmath29 of the interaction picture ) for all @xmath69 .",
    "a second subscript will indicate in which box the operator operates , as in @xmath70 , the creation operator for the @xmath69th state in the @xmath64th box .",

    "we integrate the schrdinger equation @xmath93 in the interaction picture , described above by the operators @xmath29 , arguing that over the short times that we will investigate , @xmath84 should also contribute to the coherent time development of the quantum state of the system .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath84 entangles the box states , so that it is no longer possible to treat the dynamics in each box separately . where the state space could have dimension @xmath94 in section [ jboxes ] , it now must have dimension @xmath95 , a notable increase in complexity .",
    "let us choose a basis consisting of tensor products of j box states , each being one of @xmath96 and @xmath97 , with the jth box represented at the left and the 1st box at the right , and let us label them by integers @xmath98 .",

    "the reason for this is that once the states evolve into superposition states ( and this takes some time , around 1 ps in fig .",
