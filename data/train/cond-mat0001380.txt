    "semiclassical theories have been found extremely powerful in understanding the dynamics of complex quantum mechanical systems .",
    "special attention has been paid to theories of tunneling processes as they occur in physics , chemistry , and biology .",
    "currently , a variety of quantum rate theories are in use explaining experimental findings for several situations of interest @xcite .",
    "thereby , roughly speaking , two different strategies can be distinguished .",
    "the first class of approaches constructs the rate from purely thermodynamic considerations .",
    "an example is the bounce or instanton method ( also called im@xmath0 method ) , originated by langer @xcite and extended by several authors @xcite .",
    "in essence , tunneling rates are derived from the imaginary time dynamics in the inverted potential .",
    "other approaches of this type @xcite start from periodic orbit theory @xcite in imaginary time .",
    "tractable rate formulae are obtained with the centroid method @xcite leading to a semi - empirical separation of dynamical and thermal factors .",
    "these methods are computationally very efficient and have been applied successfully to systems as diverse as tunneling centers in metals , josephson junctions , or hydrogen bonds , to name but a few .",
    "however , closer examination reveals that these theories are based in one way or another on _ ad hoc _ assumptions that are not derived from first principles .",
    "for instance , the im@xmath0 method postulates a relation between the decay rate and the imaginary part of the free energy .",
    "in fact , in some cases thermodynamic methods fail to predict the correct rate , e.g. they do not reproduce the energy diffusion limited decay for very weakly damped systems at finite temperature . moreover , these methods are designed to describe incoherent decay only .",
    "the second class of theories describes barrier crossing in terms of dynamical quantities .",
    "perhaps most familiar is yamamoto s rate formula @xcite , in essence a kubo type formula relating the rate with a flux - flux correlation function .",
    "as shown in @xcite it is exact only for scattering problems , while in multi- or metastable systems one has to assume the existence of a plateau region for times long compared to typical relaxation times but small compared to decay times .",
    "this restricts the approach to incoherent decay .",
    "recent advances in the real time description of barrier crossing based on flux - flux correlations were made e.g.  by voth _",
    "@xcite , who incorporated analytically known dynamical factors into the rate expressions .",
    "quite recently , pollak and coworkers @xcite were able to improve this idea by using a thermally symmetrized flux operator .",
    "a different way of including dynamical information in an approximate way , favored by miller and coworkers , employs semiclassical initial value representation ( ivr ) for the quantum propagator @xcite .",
    "although quite successful at high to moderate temperatures , where the quantum dynamics is governed by quasi - classical above - barrier processes , these approaches usually fail at low temperatures where deep tunneling prevails . finally , we mention a kind of hybrid approach , the `` real time '' instanton theory @xcite which includes tunneling in the real time propagator by means of instantaneous tunneling transitions .",
    "this method is restricted to multi - stable systems in the low temperature limit @xcite .",
    "hence , although the semiclassical theory of quantum tunneling is often regarded to be well settled , this turns out to be true only for some limiting cases .",
    "what would be desirable is a semiclassical theory starting from first principles that covers the entire range of temperatures as well as coherent and incoherent tunneling processes .    in the realm of classical physics",
    "the theory of thermally activated rates is rather firmly based . in a seminal paper @xcite kramers determined thermal decay rates from the equation of motion for the phase space distribution function , i.e. , from the real time dynamics of the system .",
    "a corresponding treatment of tunneling in the semiclassical limit seems not to be possible , since all real time minimal action paths connecting two sides of the barrier have energies _ larger _ than the barrier energy . in the dynamical approaches discussed above these trajectories",
    "do account for tunneling corrections to classical rates @xcite , but it is usually argued @xcite that within a semiclassical theory deep tunneling can only be described by incorporating in addition imaginary time trajectories as they are used in thermodynamic methods .",
    "the lack of a first principles semiclassical theory of tunneling is intimately connected with a fundamental shortcoming of semiclassical real time propagators derived from a single dominant path .",
    "since tunneling arises from coherent interference of waves , a satisfactory semiclassical theory needs to capture this interference pattern in terms of an appropriate family of real time paths rather than making _",
    "ad - hoc _ modifications of simple semiclassical propagators .",
    "very recently , we have proposed a theory for transport across a barrier based solely on the real time dynamics of the density matrix and the semiclassical approximation@xcite . as a notable feature",
    ", the method applies equally well to damped and undamped systems and comprises in a unified way the entire range from thermally activated decay to low temperature tunneling . in appropriate limits the results of other methods are recovered . here , we explain the technicalities of the approach and evaluate the semiclassical propagator in detail for two paradigmatic systems , namely , a double well potential and an eckart barrier .",
    "thereby , we mainly concentrate on one - dimensional models .",
    "it turns out that the corresponding theory already reveals the basic structure and that the generalization to multidimensional systems , though tedious in detail , is straightforward within the path integral formalism @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ general ] , we outline the general semiclassical theory which is then used in sec .  [ parabolic ] to derive as a simple example the stationary flux across a parabolic barrier .",
    "the main part of the paper studies the real time dynamics from high down to vanishing temperature for the cases of a double well potential ( sec .  [ double ] ) and an eckart barrier ( sec .  [ eckart ] ) . finally , in sec .  [ conclu ]",
    "we summarize the main features of the approach and present our conclusions .",
    "we consider a statistical ensemble of quantum mechanical particles of mass @xmath1 moving in a barrier potential @xmath2 at inverse temperature @xmath3 .",
    "we chose the coordinate @xmath4 so that the barrier top is located at @xmath5 and measure energies relative to the barrier energy by putting @xmath6 .",
    "the initial nonequilibrium state is assumed to be of the form of an equilibrium state restricted to the left side of the barrier .",
    "below we will invoke the semiclassical approximation which is appropriate provided the barrier height @xmath7 is by far the largest energy scale in the system .",
    "the time evolution of the density matrix @xmath8 reads in coordinate representation @xmath9 where the real - time propagator is given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 describes the initial state . in principle , for our purpose any initial distribution that matches onto equilibrium on the left side and vanishes on the right side of the barrier top is appropriate . as long as the restricted equilibrium state gives vanishing probability to find the particle on the right side of the barrier top , different initial preparations lead to the same long time behavior of the density matrix .",
    "here we put explicitly @xmath12 for convenience with the proper normalization factor @xmath13 and the equilibrium density matrix @xmath14    now , employing the path integral representation for @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , the above integrand in eq .",

    "the real time paths describe the time evolution of the system and the imaginary time path the initial state .",
    "of course , a more complete theory would explicitly include the coupling to a heat bath environment .",
    "in fact , the general scheme of this approach in the case of damped systems has already been given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "much of the analysis presented below can in principle be extended to this situation , however , only a limited number of steps can be carried out analytically due to the more complicated form of the effective action functionals . here , we limit ourselves to undamped motion which allows to treat deep tunneling without resorting to numerical methods . this way",
    ", the guiding concepts will become more transparent .",

    "limit the above path integrals are dominated by minimal action paths determined by hamilton s equation of motion either in the potential @xmath2 ( for the real time propagators ) or @xmath31 ( for the equilibrium density matrix ) .",

    "( [ gt1 ] ) in stationary phase .",
    "the stationary phase points are determined by minimizing @xmath45 with respect to the initial coordinates @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath47 since the endpoints @xmath48 are fixed , the resulting stationary phase points @xmath49 and @xmath50 are functions of time with @xmath51 , @xmath52 . for finite @xmath53",

    "[ loop ] ] . to avoid potential confusion with other methods , we emphasize that the appearance of complex paths has nothing to do with tunneling but rather is merely a consequence of the stationary phase approximation and holds also for systems with no barrier at all .",

    "any gaussian semiclassics to the real time propagator is expected to break down for very low temperatures and very long times where quantum tunneling comes into play .",
    "in fact , as yet no satisfactory semiclassical procedure was found to describe deep tunneling in the time domain . the crucial question",
    "thereby is : how can classical trajectories that either oscillate in one of the potential wells , here with energy @xmath250 , or move over the barrier , here with @xmath114 , produce exponentially small contributions to the semiclassical propagator which originate from quantum states _ connecting _ the two wells _ under _ the barrier . here",
    ", we present a mechanism that is based only upon the complex plane mechanics discussed above and avoids any additional _ ad hoc _ insertion of `` barrier paths '' . since the complex plane dynamics behaves as the usual classical real time mechanics , paths with @xmath251 never cross the barrier .",
    "however , a full semiclassical treatment needs to account for the dominant fluctuations about the semiclassical paths .",
    "now , for @xmath207 there is a whole family of loop - like orbits in the complex plane ; all with the same energy , period , and action increase after one period differing from each other only by their respective phases , i.e.  by their crossing points @xmath252 with the real axis .",
    "it turns out that each time these orbits pass their end - coordinate @xmath22 there are other trajectories of this family arbitrarily close in phase space ( see fig .",
    "[ doublephase ] ) .",
    "the role of quantum mechanics then is to induce transitions between these orbits via small fluctuations . for sufficiently long times",
    "a path starting at a certain @xmath22 near the barrier top may successively slip down to an orbit with another phase @xmath23 , eventually reach the stable regions around @xmath171 , and fluctuate in the long time limit between these regions .",
    "that this scenario actually describes the low temperature coherent tunneling dynamics has been discussed briefly in @xcite and will be described in some detail in the sequel .",
    "for @xmath249 the amplitude of the euclidian time paths is @xmath253 .",
    "thus , all stationary paths @xmath213 , @xmath254 have energy @xmath255 and period @xmath256 . then , the euclidian action @xmath257 suppresses energy fluctuations around @xmath255 exponentially , so that classical paths running in time @xmath53 from @xmath258 and @xmath259 to @xmath22 and @xmath95 , respectively , i.e.  with @xmath260 , are negligible .",
    "further , studying the short action , @xmath261 , one finds according to eq .",

    "this result combined with the fluctuation prefactor [ see eq .",
    "( [ pre ] ) ] gives for the gaussian propagator after multiple round trips and for coordinates @xmath263 @xmath264 hence , the probability to return to the starting point decreases as the number of periods increases .",
    "in contrast , in the vicinity of the wells the gaussian propagator coincides with the harmonic propagator . to be more precise , due to caustics in the semiclassics of this simple propagator at all @xmath265 , an extended semiclassical analysis must be invoked leading to an airy function ; details of the procedure are well - known @xcite and of no interest here .",
    "the important point is that in the barrier region the simple semiclassical return probability decays to zero for large times while in the well regions it remains constant .",
    "thus , we conclude that the dominant quantum fluctuations neglected in the gaussian approximation to the real time propagators are those that connect stationary paths with the same energy but different phases , i.e.  initial coordinates @xmath22 .",
    "effectively , these relevant fluctuations shift @xmath4 slightly away from the classical path @xmath213 to reach another stationary path @xmath266 ( cf .",
    "fig  [ fluczero ] ) .",
    "the corresponding change in action after a period and for small deviations is simply @xmath267 this repeats at subsequent oscillations .",
