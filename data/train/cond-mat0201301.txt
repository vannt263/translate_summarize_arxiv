    "despite endeavor over more than a decade to elucidate the nature of the critical behavior of the restricted primitive model ( rpm ) for ionic fluids , prototype of a system governed by long range coulomb interactions , no unassailable answer to this question has yet been provided by theory , experiment or computer simulation @xcite .",
    "the long range character of the interaction would suggest classical ( mean field ) behavior , whereas the well known screening of the interactions pleads in favor of an ising - type criticality typical of systems with short range interactions .",
    "in contrast to the latter case a rigorous renormalization group ( rg ) treatment allowing to decide in favor of one or the other universality class is , for the moment , still unavailable due to the lack of a satisfactory mean field starting point for rg analysis @xcite .    on the experimental side @xcite an indisputable interpretation of criticality in ionic systems and assessment of the role played by the coulomb interaction",
    "is somewhat hampered by the possible interplay of the coulomb interaction with other forces driving phase separation ( as , for instance , solvophobic effects ) , uncertainties of measurement close to the critical point or choice of appropriate order parameter to analyse the results .",
    "it seems however well established now that for many experimental systems apparent mean field behavior applies with sharp crossover ( much sharper than in non - ionic fluids ) to ising criticality close to the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "computer simulations can isolate the effect of the coulomb interactions but are plagued with their own difficulties when approaching the critical region , in particular by the limited system sizes that are currently accessible for off - lattice systems .",
    "finite size corrections to the scaling behavior may therefore be important and thwart extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in addition , the fact that the rpm , as well as most realistic continuum models , lack symmetries , that are present , for instance , in the ising or lattice - gas models has the consequence that the asymptotic scaling properties are more complex than for the latter systems . starting with the seminal work of bruce and wilding ( bw ) @xcite simulation results for the critical behavior of asymmetric fluids have customarily been analyzed along the lines of the revised scaling theory of rehr and mermin @xcite in which the two relevant scaling fields @xmath6 ( the strong ordering field ) and @xmath7 ( the weak thermal field ) are assumed to be linear combinations of deviations from the critical values of the chemical potential @xmath8 and the inverse temperature @xmath9 ( for the definition of the reduced quantities see below ) @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are system dependent coefficients defined in ref .  .",
    "the revised scaling theory assumes analyticity of @xmath14 at the critical temperature @xmath15 .",
    "although this is the case for the ising model and some models with `` hidden '' symmetry , there is no compelling reason that , in general , for fluid systems @xmath14 should lack a singularity as recognized already by rehr and mermin @xcite , yang and yang @xcite and emphasized more recently by fisher and coworkers @xcite .",
    "the latter authors , by carefully analyzing experimental results for the constant volume heat capacity @xmath16 give evidence for a divergence of @xmath17 , the so called yang - yang ( y - y ) anomaly @xcite , in co@xmath18 and propane when approaching the critical point from below , e.g.  along the critical isochore @xcite . according to fisher and orkoulas , in order to accomodate the y - y anomaly , the pressure should combine with @xmath19 and @xmath8 in eqs .  [ a1 ] and [ a2 ]  @xcite .",
    "this in turn will affect the finite size scaling ( f.s.s . )",
    "analysis - at the core of all simulation studies - through appearance of additional size dependent terms which may compete with those of the customary description .",
    "one can note , however , that for a hard core square - well model fluid the strength of the y - y anomaly appears to be quite small @xcite .",
    "the present study was undertaken to extend simulation work on the rpm @xcite to system sizes larger than previously considered , covering the volume range @xmath20 ( or linear dimension @xmath21 ) , thus providing a valuable check of the validity of previous extrapolations of the critical parameters to their thermodynamic limit . by the same token statistics of the runs performed previously with the smaller system sizes",
    "were considerably increased .",
    "in addition , these new simulations gave us the opportunity to investigate the behavior of the two contributions @xmath22 and @xmath23 to the specific heat near its critical point .",
    "the occurrence of a divergent @xmath23 would call for a revision of the revised scaling assumptions of rehr and mermin @xcite as pointed out by fisher and orkoulas @xcite .",
    "the model and a few computational details are given in sec .",
    "ii and the results in sec .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in sec .   iv .",
    "in the rpm of an ionic solution @xmath24 particles carrying a charge @xmath25 and an equal number of particles with charge @xmath26 interact via a hard sphere excluded volume and a coulomb interaction , i.e.@xmath27 where @xmath28 is the hard sphere diameter and @xmath29 the dielectric constant of the solvent assumed to be a dielectric continuum .    in fact a thermodynamic state is specified by the combination @xmath30 defining a reduced temperature ( or its inverse @xmath31 ) and a reduced chemical potential @xmath32 ) ( @xmath33 boltzmann s constant , @xmath34 the de broglie thermal wavelength ) .",
    "a reduced density is defined as @xmath35 ( @xmath36 total number of ions , @xmath37 volume ) .",
    "when hyperspherical boundary conditions @xcite are used , as done here in accord with our previous work @xcite , the particles are confined to the surface @xmath38 of a hypersphere in 4d space . in this geometry",
    "the rpm may be viewed as a system of identical particles of charge @xmath39 ( bicharges ) interacting by the potential @xcite @xmath40 the distance @xmath41 between two particles on @xmath38 , measured along the geodesic joining them , is related to the angle @xmath42 by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the radius of the hypersphere .",
    "the monte carlo ( mc ) simulations were performed in the grand canonical ( gc ) ensemble using a biasing scheme @xcite to enhance the acceptance ratio of the trial insertion and deletion moves . during the simulation",
    "runs we recorded , at fixed @xmath8 , @xmath45 and @xmath37 the joint distribution @xmath46 of particle number and energy density @xmath47 which is the basic ingredient for our analysis of the critical properties .",
    "use of histogram reweighting @xcite was made to infer the distribution at a state ( @xmath48 ) from the known one at a nearby state ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "in this section we intend to reassert , within the mixed - field f.s.s .",
    "approach of bruce and wilding @xcite , our previous estimates @xcite of the critical parameters taking into account new simulations at volumes @xmath50 and @xmath51 and results with increased statistics at @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "briefly stated , in this approach the appropriate scaling operators conjugate to the scaling fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( eqs [ a1 ] and [ a2 ] ) are assumed to be @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 @xmath57 and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the values at criticality .    with this postulate",
    "the critical behavior of the fluid system can be mapped on that of the ( symmetric ) ising spin system . in particular",
    ", the distribution @xmath60 of the ordering parameter should be invariant under the symmetry transformation @xmath61 along the coexistence curve @xmath62 and similar to that of the 3d ising magnetization .",
    "the strategy offered by bruce and wilding @xcite to determine the critical parameters @xmath15 and @xmath63 is to vary @xmath64 and @xmath12 until the distribution @xmath60 derived from @xmath46 ( measured in the simulation ) through the linear transformations eqs .",
    "[ b14 ] and [ b15 ] and integration over @xmath65 matches the distribution of the 3d ising universality class @xmath66 known from lattice spin simulations @xcite .    due to the finite size of the simulation volumes the critical parameters",
    "so obtained will be shifted with respect to their infinite volume values .",
    "finite size scaling theory tells us , however , how the apparent parameters scale with system size @xmath67 .",
    "the critical temperature , for instance , should vary as @xmath68 where allowance has been made for correction to scaling through the wegner exponent @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic states at which histograms were recorded are summarized in table i. all simulation runs , including those at @xmath70 and 10000 are new .",
    "the total number of selected configurations , spaced by 250 mc trial moves , varies between @xmath71 and 4 @xmath71 depending on volume ( cf .",
    "table i ) and is thus 4 - 10 times larger than that generated in ref .. by histogram reweighting we estimated , for each volume , an apparent critical temperature such that the order parameter distribution @xmath72 , normalized to have unit variance , matches the 3d ising model universality class .",
    "the matching of @xmath73 and @xmath74 at @xmath75 was realized in ref .",
    "using the estimate of @xmath74 made by hilfer and wilding @xcite for the 3d ising model on cubic lattices of sizes @xmath76 and @xmath77 . recently two new estimates of @xmath74 have been obtained by tsypin and blte @xcite for the 3d ising model and the spin-1 blume - capel model with lattice sizes up to @xmath78 .",
    "the two evaluations of @xmath74 at @xmath75 differ notably , especially for the values of the two maxima of @xmath74 at @xmath79 .",
    "however , tsypin and blte @xcite consider the distribution @xmath74 evaluated for the blume - capel model to be the more reliable since finite size effects appear to be smaller for the largest lattice sizes considered in their simulations . in view of these differences",
    "it seemed thus justified , in order to determine the apparent critical temperatures @xmath80 for the different volumes , to realize the matching of @xmath73 using @xmath74 obtained with the blume - capel model .",
    "for volume sizes @xmath81 the matching procedure is not without ambiguity due to poor or insufficient sampling of densities smaller or close to @xmath82 . in order to minimize the bias on @xmath83 introduced by insufficient sampling of the low densities",
    "the matching has been realized , for each volume , by determining the smallest mean square deviation between @xmath74 and @xmath84 by minimizing @xmath85 in the domain of values where @xmath73 seems most reliable with the constraint that @xmath8 and @xmath12 are such that @xmath86 = @xmath87 . here",

    "there are two equivalent minima at @xmath91 for @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the latter value has been retained .",
    "a similar minimization has also been realized using @xmath74 calculated for the 3d ising model @xcite . in this way one obtains two sets of values of @xmath83 , plotted in fig .",

    "the agreement is excellent .",
    "it is less good at the larger volume , especially for @xmath105 .",
    "the most plausible explanation for this discrepancy is a statistical effect due to insufficient sampling of the region of densities comprised between the high and low density maxima .",
    "we attempted to improve the sampling by using a multicanonical method @xcite , which permits enhanced crossing of the free energy barrier separating the gas and liquid phases , but did not observe a sensible reduction of the discrepancy .    from the knowledge of the order parameter distribution",

    "it is worth noticing that the statistical error on the values of @xmath150 is difficult to estimate but a 1% value seems to be a conservative lower bound .    an alternative approach we propose is to search for a remarkable point ( saddle point or extremum ) of @xmath150 in the whole @xmath161 plane and measure its height as a function of volume .",
    "provided such a remarkable point exists and is located in the estimated critical region , the height of @xmath150 should scale as @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the exponent of the power - law type divergence of @xmath150 in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "we stress that the mentioned error is the error on the slope inferred from the linear regression ; this error should not be assimilated with the statistical error on @xmath169 which results from the error on the estimates of the histograms used to calculate @xmath155 and is beyond reach .",

    "although the peak positions shift correctly towards the critical temperature determined above and the widths of the curves narrow with increasing system size , there is no detectable scaling of the amplitudes of the peaks over the volume range considered in this work .",

    "a possible explanation for the non - singular behavior of @xmath153 is that the amplitude of the singular term in @xmath153 is small in the rpm and the specific heat dominated by its regular contribution , it can also be remarked that the peak heights in @xmath171 would scale , assuming ising value for the specific heat exponent , only by a factor @xmath173 when doubling the linear dimensions of the system .",
