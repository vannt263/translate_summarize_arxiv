    "the well - known phase theorem @xcite holds for the final - state interaction ( fsi ) of decay processes when the final state consists of a single eigenstate of scattering .",

    "a two - channel problem was studied with a certain class of @xmath2-matrix and the correct observation was made that inelastic channels are the main source of strong phases in many @xmath0 decay modes@xcite .",
    "however , it is not easy to obtain quantitatively reliable results from the two - channel model . taking the large limit of open channels ,",
    "the statistical model @xcite was proposed as an alternative approach .",
    "quantitatively , however , it is short of predictive power since it does not ask for detailed knowledge of strong interaction .",

    "it is fair to say that at present we are far from successful computation of a fsi phase in multichannel decay processes .    in this paper",
    "we first study the two - channel problem in detail .",
    "the problem is solvable in a reasonably compact form without approximation or assumption if relevant information is available about strong interaction physics and decay branching fractions .",
    "the general solution to the two - channel toy - model shows how the elastic scattering phases and the channel coupling contribute to the total fsi phase .",
    "it concludes in agreement with donoghue _",
    "et al_@xcite that if a large strong phase emerges in the @xmath0 decay into two light - mesons , its major source is coupling to decay channels that have large branching fractions .",
    "although it points to the source of problems in strong phases , the simple two - channel model is inapplicable to @xmath0 decay .",
    "we proceed to the case of more than two decay channels .",
    "even the three - channel problem is mathematically too complicated for solving in a compact form . on the physics side",
    "our knowledge of strong interaction at total energy 5 gev ( @xmath3 ) is not good enough to carry through the analysis with precision . to cope with formidable complexity of the problem",
    ", we introduce an approximation method that works in the case that , aside from the channel of our interest , one inelastic channel dominates over all others .",
    "this is different from an approximate two - channel problem .",
    "it can happen , for instance , to the two - body light - hadron decays of @xmath0 meson when they couple to the charmed - meson pair states .",
    "we apply our approximation method to the decay @xmath1 and make semiquantitative analysis with knowledge of hadron physics currently available to us .",
    "two basic ingredients in discussion of fsi are unitarity and time - reversal . in the standard model",
    "the decay interaction is sum of effective local operators @xmath4 , each of which has a cp - violating ( and therefore t - violating ) phase factored out as @xmath5 the t - violating `` weak phase '' @xmath6 arises from the ckm elements . in computing decay amplitudes we work separately on the @xmath7-invariant part @xmath8 of the decay interaction . in the case",
    "that @xmath7-violation is more general , we can break up the weak interactions @xmath9 into @xmath7-even and @xmath7-odd parts as @xmath10 so that @xmath11 then both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are @xmath7-even since @xmath14 under time reversal . and @xmath15 for the first term @xmath16 of eq .",

    "] we should compute the decay amplitudes for @xmath12 and @xmath13 separately and take a suitable sum of them at the end .",
    "therefore it is sufficient to consider in general only @xmath7-even weak interactions .",
    "no matter what method one may use , computation of fsi phases must always be made separately for different decay operators . because two decay operators generate two different fsi phases for the same decay process even if the net quantum numbers of operators are identical .",
    "we consider in this paper only final - state interaction of strong interaction though it is in principle easy to include electromagnetic fsi",

    "until then we must not set this strong phase to zero but leave it as an unknown parameter to be determined by fit to experimental data . if such experimental fit clearly requires a large fsi angle for the @xmath278 mode of @xmath308 but not of @xmath309 , we shall be able to assert that the on - shell @xmath325 intermediate state plays an important role in the decay @xmath1 .",
    "the statement above can be made for many other two - body light - hadron modes .",
    "the @xmath45 mode couples to @xmath46 whose branching fraction is nearly an order of magnitude larger than that of @xmath45 .",
    "but perturbative calculation of the @xmath381 transition@xcite by the born diagrams without off - shell damping can easily overestimate it . with an estimate of @xmath211 along the same line as for @xmath382 , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ solutiont ] ) comes out to be negative in the case of @xmath383 , it implies that the branching fraction of @xmath46 is not large enough to affect the fsi phase for the @xmath45 amplitudes of the tree decay @xmath384 ( @xmath385 = light quarks ) .",
    "the @xmath45 of @xmath49 can be fed also by the charmed hadron channel @xmath151 whose branching fraction is two orders of magnitude larger than that of @xmath45 . for the @xmath45 amplitude through @xmath386 , coupling to @xmath151",
    "is the most important source of the strong phase . to obtain the strong phases and to compare with experiment",
    ", we again need to know about relative importance of the two classes of decay ; @xmath387 and @xmath388 for @xmath389 .",
    "in contrast , the tree - dominated ckm - favored decay modes such as @xmath390 have no wide open inelastic channels .",
    "transition to the @xmath391 channel is as insignificant as the transition to @xmath328 in the @xmath278 mode . since the @xmath391 decay branching fraction is comparable to that of @xmath392 and @xmath211 is much smaller than @xmath173 ( cf eqs .",
    "( [ rhokstar ] ) and ( [ estimate ] ) ) , of its elastic scattering , we expect that @xmath393 and therefore the channel coupling contribution is unimportant .",
    "it means that the fsi phases are small in these modes and that simple short - distance calculation of the phases can produce an answer not far from reality .",
    "one of our purposes is to solve the most general two - channel model exactly and to clarify the mechanism of generating strong phases in this toy model .",
    "we have seen above that existence of competing channels completely changes the strong phase from that of the `` elastic rescattering phase '' in all cases of two - channel @xmath2-matrix .",
    "unitarity plays an important role here .",
    "the other purpose is to introduce a feasible approximation scheme which may be applicable to cases of special interest in @xmath0 decay .",
    "we have applied this method to the decay @xmath1 and have made semiquantitative analysis .",
    "but its outcome is not numerically satisfying because of limitation in available knowledge about off - diagonal scattering .",
    "we have extended our analysis to the general multichannel case and come to one simple interesting observation : though it may sound odd , inelastic scattering tend to enhance the strong phase of the elastic channel most when inelastic amplitudes are real ( _ i.e. , _ @xmath394 = imaginary ) rather than imaginary , if the strong phases of the inelastic decay amplitudes are small .",
    "( [ fsiab ] ) . )",
    "it is a big challenge to go beyond the two - channel approximation . as the number of channels @xmath144 increases , the number of parameters in the fsi relation increases as @xmath143 for strong interaction .",
    "in addition we need piece of information from weak interaction . in the truncated approximation",
    "we have kept only a single dominant one among the inelastic channels .",
    "our assumption is that all other inelastic channels are less important or else sum up in random phases to become numerically insignificant .",
    "if the higher inelastic channels do not sum randomly , there must be some underlying dynamical reason for it .",
    "in such a case some approach orthogonal to ours may have advantage .",
    "for instance , it is an approach based on quarks and gluons instead of hadrons .",
    "the major source of the strong ( fsi ) phase in the multichannel case is the transition to inelastic channels .",
    "consequently accurate computation of the fsi phases depends on knowledge of the transition @xmath2-matrix at energy @xmath53 between a channel of our interest and dominant inelastic channels .",
    "that is , we need to know dynamics of long and intermediate distances at this energy .",
    "the present author is of the opinion that quantitatively we have a little better handle on hadron physics numerically than on the soft and collinear quarks and gluons in this territory . but opinions probably divide among physicists of different generations .",
