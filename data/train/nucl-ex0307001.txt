    ", the assumption that the photon interacts predominantly via an intermediate vector meson has been very successful ; recent reconsideration of this model provides a quantitative description of the data for all four form factors . below @xmath5 of 10 gev@xmath7",
    ", one must use non - perturbative qcd , and only qcd - based phenomenological models of the nucleon are available .",
    "the most successful qcd based model is the relativistic constituent quark model , which describes the drop - off in the ratio @xmath0 observed in this experiment . at a very large , but not quantitatively defined @xmath5 , a perturbative version of qcd ( pqcd ) pioneered by brodsky and collaborators should be valid .",
    "an important consequence of pqcd is hadron helicity conservation ; in terms of the non - spin flip and spin flip form factors ( dirac and pauli ) , pqcd has generally been understood to predict a faster decrease with @xmath5 for @xmath59 than @xmath75 , by a factor of 1/@xmath5 .",
    "the data presented here clearly show that the ratio @xmath76 is still increasing monotonically up to 5.6 gev@xmath7 . recently a careful re - examination of the pqcd prediction has led to the inclusion of a logarithmic factor and good agreement with the behavior of @xmath66 reported in this paper .",
