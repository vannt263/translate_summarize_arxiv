    "if two hadrons @xmath7 are linked by @xmath8 , then necessarily hadronic pairs of @xmath9 or @xmath10 have the potential to feel a force from @xmath11 exchange .",
    "this force will be attractive in at least some channels .",
    "long ago@xcite the idea of @xmath11 exchange between flavored mesons , in particular charm , was suggested as a source of potential ",
    "deusons\"@xcite . using the deuteron binding as normalization , the attractive force between the @xmath12 charmed @xmath13 and its @xmath14 counterpart @xmath15",
    "was calculated for the @xmath16 s - wave combination with total @xmath17 , and the results compared with the enigmatic charmonium state @xmath18@xcite .    in all these examples , as in the more traditional case of the nucleon , where the @xmath19 coupling is the source of an attractive force that helps to form the deuteron , the exchanged @xmath11 was emitted and absorbed in a relative p - wave with respect to the hadrons . in such cases ,",
    "the binding energies that result are @xmath20mev ; this in particular has encouraged interest in the @xmath18 which is within errors degenerate with the @xmath21 threshold .",
    "it has recently been pointed out@xcite that the exchange of a @xmath11 in s - wave , between pairs of hadrons that are themselves in relative s - wave , leads to deeply bound states between those hadrons . instead of binding of a few mev , as in the cases considered historically",
    ", there is now the potential for binding on the scale of @xmath22mev , leading to a rich spectroscopy of states that are far from the di - hadron channels that create them .",
    "we shall argue that examples of such a spectroscopy appear to be manifested among charmonium - like mesons .",
    "we organize this paper as follows .",
    "first we summarize the general arguments for expecting large binding energies due to s - wave @xmath11 exchange .",
    "we shall consider a chiral lagrangian model to illustrate and quantify the phenomenon of energy shifts of @xmath23mev , focusing specifically on the charmonium - like @xmath24 isoscalar ( @xmath25 ) channel . in section [ sec : chiralmodel ] we investigate the connection between the chiral potential and the decay width of the relevant charmed mesons , first in the heavy quark limit with point particles and subsequently in the non - heavy quark limit and with form - factors .",
    "then , we solve the schrdinger equation and discuss the uncertainties within the model .",
    "detailed results for the charmonium - like @xmath26 are presented in section [ sec : spectroscopy ] along with results for other @xmath27 , isospin , and flavor channels .",
    "we discuss the limitations of our approximation to the strong interaction in section [ sec : uncertaintities ] , give phenomenological implications and suggest experimental searches in section [ sec : phenomenlogy ] and finish with conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "several groups have studied the following meson - pairs looking for bound states in total @xmath27 channels due to pion exchange ( from here on @xmath28 etc .",
    "will be taken to include the charge conjugate channel ) : @xmath29 these combinations were discussed in @xcite . in all of these examples parity conservation requires that the @xmath11 is emitted in a p - wave ; the hadrons involved at the emission vertices have their constituents in a relative @xmath30-wave , ( we use s , p to denote the angular momentum between hadrons , and @xmath31 to denote internal angular momentum of the constituents within a hadron ) . in such cases ,",
    "the @xmath11 emission being in p - wave causes a penalty for small momentum transfer , @xmath32 , which is manifested by the interaction@xcite    @xmath33    where @xmath34 , @xmath35 being the masses of the mesons in the process @xmath36 .",
    "( for a discussion of this interaction , and its sign , see eq .",
    "( 20 ) in ref@xcite ) .",
    "the resulting potential is @xmath37 for low momentum transfer and has been found to give bindings on the scale of a few mev , which is in part a reflection of the p - wave penalty .",
    "there is no such penalty when @xmath11 emission is in s - wave , which is allowed when the hadrons @xmath7 have opposite parities .",
    "examples involving the lightest charmed mesons are @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "p - wave @xmath11 exchange carries a @xmath32 penalty at each @xmath40 vertex .",
    "one might naively anticipate that the transition from a @xmath13 or @xmath15 , with constituents in @xmath30-wave , to the @xmath41 or @xmath42 , with constituents in @xmath43-wave , would restore a @xmath32 penalty , leading to small binding effects as in the cases previously considered .",
    "however , as we now argue , this need not be the case , and energy shifts of @xmath23mev can arise .",
    "there is a long history of data on @xmath11 transitions between hadrons of opposite parity which indicate that the s - wave coupling is significant when @xmath44 . in the charm sector of interest here ,",
    "the large widths@xcite for @xmath45mev and @xmath46mev suggest that , even after phase space is taken into account , there is a significant transition amplitude .",
    "this non - suppression was specifically commented upon in the classic quark model paper of ref.@xcite .",
    "it arises from a derivative operator acting on the internal hadron wave function , which enables an internal @xmath30 to @xmath43 transition to occur without suppression even when @xmath32 vanishes .",
    "this can be seen when @xmath47 is expanded to @xmath48 , where @xmath49 the internal quark momentum@xcite .",
    "feynman , _",
    "et al._@xcite argued for this form on general grounds of galilean invariance .",
    "the presence of @xmath49 gives the required derivative operator , and hence the unsuppressed @xmath50 transition .",
    "an unsuppressed transition , when applied to @xmath11 exchange in the @xmath51 system ( e.g. @xcite ) causes the chiral model analogue of eq . in the @xmath52 channel to become @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the @xmath55 coupling constant ( up to a phase ) , @xmath56 mev , @xmath32 is the exchanged three - momentum , @xmath57 ( @xmath58 for the @xmath59 system ) , and @xmath60 is the usual contraction of pauli matrices resulting from the exchange of an isovector by two isospin - half particles .",
    "@xmath61 is the model dependent form - factor which regulates the potential and would be unity in the chiral model .    in the derivation of the potential a static approximation has been made to the pion propagator .",
    "the full propagator is @xmath62 .",
    "approximating @xmath63 and @xmath64 one recovers the form of the propagator presented in the potential , eq .  .",
    "the potential is similiar to one presented in table 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , who were investigating a @xmath11 exchange model of the @xmath65 @xmath66(4430 ) .",
    "they considered only the @xmath67 channel and omitted the @xmath68 factor ( which is unity for @xmath67 ) .",
    "we have made this factor explicit as it will become crucial when we study the @xmath25 sector later .",
    "the absence of a @xmath69 penalty factor is immediately apparent .",
    "the scale is now being set by the mass gap squared , which is equal to the timelike component of the momentum transfer vector squared , @xmath70 as @xmath71 .",
    "this potential and any bound states have immediate implications for a rather rich set of physics .",
    "the potential also applies for the @xmath72 system , and the bottomonium and strangeonium analogs of @xmath51 and @xmath72 , by exchanging the masses with their appropriate counterparts .",
    "note that the potential in eq .   has no spin dependence and",
    "therefore any results apply equally to the @xmath73 spins coupled to total spin @xmath74 , @xmath75 or @xmath76 .",
    "for example , if an isoscalar @xmath24 bound state is found , then we also expect degenerate @xmath77 and @xmath78 states .",
    "thus on rather general grounds we may anticipate significant energy shifts , @xmath79mev ) , due to @xmath11 exchange at least in some channels between such hadrons in a relative s - wave .",
    "signals may be anticipated below or near threshold in the following channels ( in the charmonium analogues , involving charm and anti - charm mesons for either @xmath80 0 or 1 , or in exotic states with manifest charm involving two charm mesons ) : @xmath81 we also find that it is possible that @xmath82 states could bind which would lead to more @xmath83 configurations .",
    "pion exchange depends on the presence of @xmath84 flavors , therefore there will be no such effects in the @xmath85 analogues . further",
    ", the potential depends only on the quantum numbers of the light quarks .",
    "therefore , there will be effects in the strange and bottom analogues , which can add to the test of such dynamics at different kinematics .",
    "the parameter @xmath86 in eq .",
    "is closely connected to the width of the @xmath87 decay .",
    "data exists on this decay which constrains the value of @xmath86 and hence the spectrum of the model .",
    "we discuss the extraction of @xmath86 from the decay width in the next section .",
    "being simply related to the @xmath55 coupling constant , @xmath86 also appears in the chiral formula for the @xmath88 decay width .",
    "( 137 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite gives : @xmath89 which is valid in the heavy quark limit .",
    ".[tab : pdgdata ] data of low lying mesons of different flavor sectors with opposite parity which exhibt a large width .",
    "values taken from the particle data group@xcite .",
    "no width data are available for the bottom sector and no branching fractions are given for the charmed sector . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the binding energies are generally deeper than in the charmed analogues .",
    "this is easily understood : the higher mass of the @xmath90 mesons result in a lower kinetic energy . in general",
    "we predict analogous effects in the @xmath90 analogs of the charmed system , subject to differences in the width which is experimentally undetermined for the @xmath91 .",
    "similar effects may exist in the @xmath92 system .",
    "however the phenomenology of the @xmath93 is more complex and the heavy quark approximation is certainly inadequate .",
    "together with the constraint on @xmath86 implied by the width , this prevents us making quantitative conclusions , we only note the qualitative possibility that s - wave pion exchange may produce binding in the @xmath92 system .",
    "the results for binding energies , and even whether states bind at all , are sensitive to parameters , and also to more complicated ( possibly more realistic ) modelling of the strong interactions .",
    "we have focussed solely on the @xmath94-channel force from virtual pion exchange , specifically , the four fermion intermediate states in the fock state .",
    "therefore , we have taken only the real part of the potential and solved the schrdinger equation and ignored the imaginary part arising from the exchange of a real , on - shell , pion .",
    "there are also @xmath30-channel forces arising from intermediate @xmath95 excited states . more immediately in our molecular approach there are intermediate states with a real pion , of form @xmath96 .",
    "the ability of a virtual exchanged particle to be on - shell introduces an imaginary component to the matrix element and , hence , to the potential .",
    "the effect is to make the energy complex : the real part is taken as the binding energy while the imaginary part is interpreted as the width of the state . that the on - shell intermediate state would manifest as a width seems natural as it represents a direct connection between the bound state and a possible decay channel .",
    "the picture is then that the @xmath41 decays into a @xmath97 and the  would be \" quasi - molecular bound state disintegrates , or even fails to form .",
    "thus , we expect the on - shell pion contribution will endow any state produced by this mechanism with a width , or that it produces a non - resonant background which may obscure the signal .    within our approximations",
    "we find deeply bound meta - stable states .",
    "the @xmath96 generates widths and background .",
    "whether these states remain visible is then dependent upon the relative importance of neglected forces , such as mixing with @xmath95 or @xmath96 .",
    "in general it is difficult to calculate the impact of neglected effects , not least because strong interactions are complicated and we are approximating one particular force as dominant .",
    "if the @xmath98 is an example of our states , then its visibility shows that nature is kind , at least in the @xmath24 channel .",
    "it has given a width of @xmath22mev and a visibility above background .",
    "it could be that this fortune is because a @xmath95 component drives the production , and the @xmath99 rearrangement then drives the @xmath100 signal .",
    "thus the conclusion of this analysis is that while it is _ possible _ that a deep bound molecular spectroscopy with signals visible above a background can arise , _ it is not mandatory_. however , as we have already noted , the appearance of @xmath98 and @xmath101 are consistent with being the first two states observed in such a spectroscopy .",
    "the immediate test of this is to seek evidence for these states in @xmath102 . unless there is some dynamical suppression",
    ", such channels must show strength if a @xmath103 bound system is present .",
    "if this first test is passed , then a search for other transitions and evidence for analogous states in @xmath104 would be warranted . in this latter case",
    "we note the apparent presence of anomalous state @xmath105@xcite    this and other phenomenological implications are the theme of the next section .",
    "we have studied the @xmath103 molecules and found deeply bound states with @xmath25 , which are degenerate for the @xmath106 channels .",
    "however , the number of potentially deeply bound states is very sensitive to parameters .",
    "typically we anticipate the binding energies of the @xmath25 states to have the orders of magnitude as follows : 1s @xmath107mev ; 2s @xmath108mev , with an exotic @xmath5 between the 1s and 2s levels .    further reasons to anticipate a rich spectroscopy are that this s - wave @xmath11 exchange also can occur for @xmath109 and the off - diagonal @xmath110 .",
    "the strengths for each of these in the heavy quark limit are identical . in practice",
    "there will be model dependent perturbations due to mass shifts and mixings ; these are beyond the present paper and only merit study if the general features of our model show up in the data .    in general :",
    "if s - wave pion exchange forms deeply bound charmed molecules comprised of @xmath111 ( and manifest charm analogs ) , there will be a rich spectroscopy of states in the @xmath112 gev mass range .",
    "these can include states that are superficially charmonium , such as @xmath25 , @xmath113 and @xmath24 , as well as exotic @xmath114 and @xmath5 .",
    "in addition there are also states with charmonium character but @xmath67 .",
    "states such as @xmath25 , @xmath113 and @xmath24 may contain @xmath95   in their fock state and hence be produced at measurable rates ; the other states have no such aid , but may be produced in radiative or strong transitions from higher lying molecules . manifestly charm ( @xmath115 , etc . )",
    "states are also expected and are degenerate with the @xmath116 charmonium like states .",
    "the pattern and observability of these will depend on the detailed pattern of the spectroscopy .",
    "the states that are most amenable to experimental study are the @xmath25 , @xmath24 .",
    "these occur in @xmath59 , and also can arise from the off - diagonal s - wave potential for @xmath117 .",
    "hence there can be a rather rich spectroscopy in the @xmath24 sector .",
    "as there are apparently several states of varying statistical significance emerging in the data , we shall primarily focus on this channel here .",
    "the best established enigmatic structure in the @xmath24 sector here is @xmath98 which is seen in @xmath100 .",
    "its typical hadronic width @xmath118mev implies that either @xmath100 is not the dominant decay channel or that 40 years of experience with the ozi rule and strong interactions is wrong .",
    "given the nearness of the @xmath119 thresholds which can be accessed in s - wave , rearrangement into @xmath100 at low momentum seems reasonable , and has been invoked as a qualitative explanation of these phenomena@xcite .",
    "as @xmath15 and @xmath120 , whereas @xmath121 , then if the dynamics are associated with the nearby @xmath122 and @xmath123 thresholds , such as @xmath98 being a @xmath122 molecule , or a hybrid @xmath95   that is dynamically attracted towards that threshold , then strength should be seen in the @xmath124 channels@xcite . however ,",
    "if the @xmath98 is a @xmath103 bound state , then the favored strong decay will be @xmath125 in contrast to the aforementioned @xmath122 or @xmath126 .",
    "a preliminary report from belle@xcite sees no evidence for @xmath127 in the @xmath98 region .",
    "this disfavors @xmath122 and potentially also the @xmath128 channel .",
    "thus by default , the possibility that the strength is driven by @xmath102 becomes tantalizing .",
    "thus an immediate consequence of this interpretation is that if the @xmath98 is a @xmath103 molecule , there _ must _ be significant coupling of the @xmath129 that could exceed that to @xmath128 .",
    "more generally an unavoidable conclusion of this dynamics is that in the @xmath24 sector the @xmath130 channel has significant strength in the region of any @xmath103 molecular states .",
    "hence we urge measurement of the relative importance of the channels @xmath130 and of @xmath131 ( when , in the latter , @xmath132 has been removed ) .",
    "the depth of binding of the ground state with trial wave functions already suggested@xcite the tantalizing possibility that a radially excited state could also be bound .",
    "numerical solutions of the schrodinger equation confirmed that this is likely to be the case in the range of models discussed here .",
    "the excitation energy for radial excitation of a compact qcd @xmath95  state is @xmath133mev ; it takes less energy @xmath23mev to excite the extended molecular system which has no linearly rising potential .",
    "the spatial extent of the molecular @xmath76s system is significantly greater than that of @xmath95   hadrons .",
    "the rearrangement of constituents leading to final states of the form @xmath134 + light mesons then rather naturally suggests that the lower ( radial ) states convert to @xmath100 ( @xmath135 ) respectively . in this context",
    "it is intriguing that there are states observed with energies and final states that appear to be consistent with this : @xmath136 @xcite and the possible higher state @xmath137 @xcite are respectively 170mev and 70 mev below the @xmath138 combined masses of 4430mev . here again , for a @xmath103 molecular state , we would expect significant coupling to @xmath102 .",
    "if these states were to be established as members of molecular systems , one could tune the model accordingly .",
    "further , this could be an interesting signal for a @xmath103 quasi - molecular spectroscopy with transitions among states that could be revealed in , for example , @xmath139 .",
    "indeed , if we identify @xmath75s@xmath140 and @xmath76s@xmath141 , then we expect the exotic @xmath5 to occur in the vicinity of the @xmath98 .",
    "given that lattice qcd finds activity for a hybrid cc * signal in this channel in this region , one should now actively search for evidence .",
    "a clear signature is that the @xmath5 hybrid will couple to @xmath128 in either the @xmath123 or @xmath122 combinations ; looking for the presence of strength in @xmath142 which does not include @xmath132 should thus be a primary endeavor .",
    "the absence of such a channel could have far reaching implications for theory .",
    "while our discussion has centered on charmonium , the remarks hold more generally .",
    "since the attraction of the potential depends only on the quantum numbers of the light @xmath143 , it follows immediately that the flavor of the heavy quarks is irrelevant , at least qualitatively .",
    "hence we expect similar effects to occur in the @xmath144 and @xmath145 sectors .",
    "it has been noted that @xmath146gev appears to have an anomalous affinity for @xmath147@xcite .",
    "this state is @xmath148 mev below @xmath149 threshold . in the @xmath150 channel",
    "there is an enhancement at 2175mev@xcite .",
    "this is approximately 125mev below the @xmath151 threshold .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath152 spectroscopy ; however , as commented earlier , analysis here is less reliable , as the heavy quark approximation fails , and the phenomenology of the @xmath153 pair is more complicated@xcite .",
    "the primary test for this picture is that if the states in the @xmath154 to 4.5 gev region are deeply bound @xmath103 spectroscopy , then their decays in charm pairs must show strength in the @xmath102 channels .",
    "the energy dependence of this channel and that of @xmath128 ( with no @xmath132 ) can reveal the mixings between @xmath103 and @xmath155 molecular systems .",
    "the presence of exotic @xmath5 is also expected .",
    "in general we find that deeply bound molecules in the @xmath99 system should occur as a result of @xmath11 exchange in s - wave , leading to a potentially rich spectroscopy .",
    "whether such states are narrow enough to show up above background is a question that experiment may resolve .",
    "we note however that the emerging data on the @xmath24 states known as @xmath98 and @xmath101 are consistent with being examples of these molecular states .",
    "the immediate test is to verify if the prominent channels with manifest charm in this mass region are @xmath102 .",
    "if this is confirmed , then more detailed studies will be merited , in particular searches for an exotic @xmath5 in the vicinity of 4.2gev .",
    "this state could be produced via @xmath156 , and/or be revealed in 1@xmath157 .",
    "table [ table : morecharm ] with h=1.3 shows a possible spectroscopy consistent with the y(4260 ) and y(4360 ) as the 1s and 2s @xmath24 states . in this case , the exotic states expected are i=0 @xmath77 also at 4260 and 4360 ( in both charmonium - like and manifestly charm channels ) ; the isoscalar @xmath5 at 4250 and 4395 ; and also i=1  charmonium \" states , including @xmath24 at 4390 .",
    "as long as one picks and chooses which datum one will fit , it is possible to fit it in a molecular model .",
    "a reason is that binding energies are very sensitive to parameters that are not well determined elsewhere .",
    "thus a model designed to fit a single state has limited appeal .",
    "the more relevant test is whether a group of states share a common heritage , and their production or decay properties reveal the underlying molecular structure . in the particular case here , one can fit the masses and decay widths in tetraquark , hybrid and molecular models .",
    "as such the existence of these states does not discriminate among them .    however , the pattern of @xmath27 and the decay channels differ .",
    "thus the sharpest tests of their dynamical structure appears to be in the decay branching ratios .",
    "hence , for example , the @xmath98 as a @xmath158 tetraquark would couple to @xmath159 ; a hybrid or molecule associated with @xmath122 threshold would be expected to appear in @xmath160 ; molecules associated with the @xmath103 threshold by contrast would have significant strength in the @xmath102 channels . thus the decay branching ratios of states seem likely to be sharper indicators of their dynamical nature than simply their masses .",
    "if our hypothesis is correct , we expect significant strength in the @xmath161 channels in the 4 to 5 gev region .",
    "such evidence may already exist among the data sets for @xmath1 annihilation involving isr at babar and belle .",
