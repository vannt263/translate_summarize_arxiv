    "hattori et al . ( 1997 ; hereafter h97 ) have recently shown that the well studied qso lens q2016 + 112 is coincident with an extended x - ray source of hot bremsstrahlung radiation , axj2019 + 112 .",
    "the association is based on good positional agreement with high resolution rosat hri data and also by a plausible consistency in redshift between the central lensing galaxy at @xmath3 ( schneider et al .",
    "1985 ) and an x - ray emission line , interpreted as fexxv at @xmath10 .",
    "the detection of enriched gas at high redshift , comparable in iron abundance to local clusters , is puzzling and exacerbated by the absence of any obvious cluster of galaxies at this location ( schneider et al 1985 , langston , fischer & aspin 1991 ) , to provide a potential means of igm enrichment .",
    "other claims of `` dark ''   cluster sized objects have been made on the basis of sz - decrements ( jones et al .",
    "1997 , richards et al . 1997 ) indicating cluster sized plasma concentrations at redshifts in excess of unity ( bartlett et al . 1998 ) .",
    "however , a follow - up deep x - ray observation of pc1643 + 4631 limits any such plasma to an unreasonably high redshift ( kneissl , sunyaev & white 1998 ) , and there is no evidence for an excess of galaxies toward that direction ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , confirmation for the existence of these high redshift ` dark ' clusters should await improved radio data .",
    "in contrast , fairly conventional looking x - ray selected clusters have now been identified at redshifts at high as @xmath11 ( @xcite , rosati et al .",
    "these clusters have obvious e / so color sequences , identified by optical - ir color and , depending on their masses , are hard to account for in the standard account of structure formation with high @xmath12 ( bahcall & fan 1998 , eke et al .",
    "1998 ) . on purely empirical grounds ,",
    "the existence of x - ray luminous clusters at @xmath13 is not surprising .",
    "recently completed deep x - ray surveys show no evidence of a decline in the space density of @xmath14 x - ray selected clusters over a wide redshift range , @xmath15 ( rosati et al .",
    "1998a ) .    here",
    "we show that the low galactic latitude of axj2019 + 112 @xmath16 significantly impedes the detection of faint galaxies in this field , due to the extended halos of numerous bright stars and significant galactic extinction . in ",
    "3 we analyze very deep , @xmath17 images taken with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ) on keck ii (  2 ) , and identify a sequence of red galaxies in @xmath18 , centered on the lens .",
    "this identification is bolstered by deep @xmath19band images , obtained using the new infrared spectrograph and imaging camera sofi on the ntt . in ",
    "4 we reanalyze the archived rosat hri x - ray observations of this field , possibly resolving three significant sources of emission , one of which is marginally extended and coincident with the cluster , leading to a significant revision of the published x - ray luminosity . in ",
    "5 we provide an independent upper limit to the m / l for the cluster from a weak lensing analysis using the keck images . in  6 we deconvolve the central region of the field , finding an arc around the brightest cluster elliptical , and finally in  7 we use this and a simple lens model to reconcile the many radio sources and optical / ir lensing features . in  8",
    "we summarize the main results and conclusions .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath20 .",
    "deep @xmath21 and @xmath22 images were obtained with lris at the keckii telescope on the night of 1997 june 29th .",
    "the seeing was good , @xmath23 in the @xmath24band and @xmath25 in @xmath21 .",
    "the images cover an area of size @xmath26 .",
    "the optical images were debiased and flattened with dome flats and illumination corrected using standard procedures .",
    "the @xmath24band images are badly affected by fringing . this was accurately removed by generating a fringing pattern from combined observations of other fields taken on the same night .",
    "the resulting @xmath21 and @xmath24band images were aligned with a small correction for a relative distortion across the field , requiring a third order polynomial .",
    "the final , averaged images have total exposure times of 1480s in @xmath22 and 1980s in @xmath21 with a scale of @xmath27pixel and represent the highest quality optical images of this field to date .",
    "calibration was obtained in july 1998 by observing the field and several landolt standards with lris and the same filter .",
    "the magnitude zero point uncertainties are @xmath28 in both the @xmath22 and @xmath29bands , and no appreciable color term was detected . due to the low galactic latitude of the field ( @xmath30 ) ,",
    "the error in the absolute zero point is dominated by the uncertainty in the value of the galactic extinction . @xcite",
    "give an extinction of @xmath31 at our position , corresponding to @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the more direct and higher resolution estimation of @xcite , based on an iras / dirbe map , gives @xmath34 , in marginal agreement with @xcite .",
    "we adopt the extinction of @xcite , which yields @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the total zero point uncertainties are @xmath38 in @xmath21 , @xmath39 in @xmath22 and @xmath40 in @xmath18 . the @xmath41 limiting magnitudes within an aperture of @xmath42 are @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "in addition wide field @xmath19band images were acquired on the night of 1998 july 10th , with sofi , a new wide field infra  red imager and spectrograph on the eso ntt ( moorwood , cuby & lidman 1998 ) .",
    "sofi uses a rockwell 1024 square hg : cd : te device , which gives a field size of @xmath45 in the large field imaging mode .",
    "the pixel scale is @xmath46 .    in total , 90 separate images of mg2016 were taken with the @xmath1 filter .",
    "each image is itself a stack of six short integrations , each of 10 seconds .",
    "the telescope was offset in a random manner by @xmath47 or less between each stack to help in generating an accurate sky background measurement over the full field .",
    "the data was reduced by first subtracting the bias with an averaged dark frame , and the dividing out the variations in pixel sensitivity with normalized dome flats .",
    "the sky was estimated for each image individually by constructing a running mean of the adjacent 10 dithered exposures , with suitable clipping to remove objects .",
    "the images were then registered and combined .",
    "the intensity of the sky during the observations ranged between 13 and 13.2 mag / arcsec@xmath48 .",
    "the final @xmath1 image is the average of 68 images with a resulting seeing of @xmath49 and a total exposure time of 4080s .",
    "this image excludes frames with resolution lower than @xmath50 comprising @xmath51 of the total .",
    "the conditions at the time of the observations were photometric . the magnitude scale was determined by observing four standards from the list of persson et al .",
    "the scatter between the standards is 0.015 magnitudes .",
    "the 5@xmath52 detection within a @xmath42 aperture is @xmath53 .",
    "due to the low galactic latitude of the field , the star density is very high , so that most of the area of the field is covered by the extended haloes of the brightest stars , especially in the @xmath24band ( fig [ fig1]a ) .",
    "we find that the best approach to dealing with this problem is to generate a `` halo ''   pattern by setting the central parts of the stars and the saturation spikes to the average background level and then applying a broad , @xmath54 , median filter to the image .",
    "the pattern thus obtained is subtracted from the original frame and the resulting image used for object detection . in a final step ,",
    "all the bright cores of the stars , including their saturated trails , are masked out . the initial and final , ` de - haloed '",
    "@xmath24band images are shown for comparison in fig 1a , b .",
    "the smoothing and masking affects the photometry of bright extended objects , but on average it does not affect the fainter ones .",
    "this is established using similarly deep but much higher latitude keck @xmath24band observations of a control image psr 1640 + 22 field ( @xcite ) .",
    "this field was scaled so that the background noise level was the same as in our q2016 + 112 @xmath22 image",
    ". then we add it to all the haloes and bright objects from our cluster field , i.e. the difference between fig 1a and fig 1b . in this way",
    ", a test image is created with the same ` halo ' characteristics as fig 1a but with a known ` uncontaminated ' galaxy background for performing tests .",
    "we then apply exactly the same halo removing procedure described above . in establishing the errors introduced by the haloes and the improvement from the halo removal procedure we make use of the detection software sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) to produce three catalogs .",
    "firstly we create a catalog of the the photometric properties of the test field before any changes are made ( catalog o ) .",
    "secondly a catalog is created for the halo contaminated control ( catalog h ) field by adding the halos from the cluster frame to the control field , and finally a catalog ( dh ) is generated for the halo subtracted control field after applying our correction for the haloes in exactly the same way as for the cluster field .",
    "comparing the test field catalog ( o ) with those of the halo affected images of this same field ( h and dh ) allows a reliable empirical estimate of the effect of the haloes on the magnitude estimates and also measures the degree of improvement achieved by our halo removal procedure .",
    "the comparison of the magnitude differences between catalogs ( h ) and ( o ) , and catalog ( dh ) and ( o ) shows that the presence of numerous stars with extended haloes distorts the estimation of the background , and is a stronger source of photometric noise than any additional uncertainty in eliminating the haloes",
    ". these tests also allow us to estimate the percentage of ` useful surface ' recovered with our procedure .",
    "on the image obtained after adding the haloes we only detect between @xmath55at @xmath56 and @xmath57 at @xmath58 of the objects which were initially present on the psr 1640 + 22 image .",
    "after the halo removing procedure , we recover respectively between @xmath59 and @xmath60 of the same objects .",
    "the maximum possible detection efficiency ( found by excluding from the psr 1640 + 22 original frame all objects which have at least one pixel in the masked areas ) is @xmath61at @xmath62 and @xmath63 , in the last case approaching the percentage of ` non - masked ' area , @xmath64 .",
    "this means that apart from obtaining slightly more reliable magnitudes , the followed procedure increases by @xmath65 the useful surface for detecting faint objects .",
    "fortunately , as can be seen in fig 1 , the central region containing the cluster is one of the least affected by haloes .",
    "but in the rest of the image , in particular areas close to bright haloes , the tests show that apart from the standard photometric errors there is an increased random error in the magnitude estimates of @xmath66 in the @xmath24band magnitude compared to the ` halo - free ' image .",
    "the detection and classification of objects in the @xmath67 and @xmath68 images is made using sextractor v2.0 ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "this software smooths the images with a gaussian of size close to the seeing width , and then locates peaks above a given threshold . to obtain accurate colors we use the @xmath24band image for detection and use the apertures obtained for each of image to perform the @xmath21 and @xmath69band photometry .",
    "these matched apertures are ideal given the very similar seeing for all 3 passbands .",
    "it was found that somewhat different definitions of magnitudes are required for bright and faint galaxies for best results , due to the approach of all faint galaxies to the seeing profile .",
    "for the bright galaxies we adopt the sextractor kron - like ` automatic ' magnitudes @xmath70 , with a @xmath71 parameter of 2.5 .",
    "these apertures encompass @xmath72 of the total object magnitudes ( bertin 1998 ) .",
    "to prevent the magnitudes from being affected by crowding , sextractor masks the pixels belonging to neighboring objects and replaces their values by those of pixels lying symmetric opposed to the source center . for faint objects ( @xmath73 ) ,",
    "we measure the magnitude within a fixed aperture of @xmath42 and correct it to the automatic magnitude assuming that faint objects have roughly stellar profiles .",
    "this was established by stacking together many faint objects .",
    "the corresponding corrections are @xmath74 in the @xmath24band and @xmath75 in the @xmath21 band .",
    "sextractor assigns to each object a value of the parameter `` class - star '' , which ranges from 0 to 1 .",
    "if the seeing fwhm is well determined , stars obtain values of this parameter close to 1 , whereas for extended objects it tends to be close to 0 .",
    "the classification , performed using the @xmath24band images , works satisfactorily for objects with @xmath76 , which corresponds to a detection with a @xmath77 within a @xmath42 aperture . at fainter magnitudes ,",
    "sextractor assigns similar values of the `` class - star ''   parameter @xmath78 to all objects .",
    "one of our main concerns is to avoid the contamination of our galaxy sample by stars , specially some of them , e.g. disk m dwarfs , would have the same colors as early - type galaxies at the cluster redshift .",
    "this is achieved by excluding those objects with @xmath79 and imposing a very conservative threshold in the `` class - star ''   parameter , @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath18 vs. @xmath22 plots of the central region around the lens and the rest of the frame are shown in fig [ cmdia ] .",
    "objects with @xmath21 fainter that @xmath81 , corresponding to a @xmath82 detection within a @xmath42 aperture , have been excluded .",
    "fig [ vik ] shows the @xmath18 vs @xmath83 for all the galaxies in the field .",
    "objects fainter that @xmath84 .",
    "corresponding to a @xmath82 detection within a @xmath42 aperture , have been excluded .",
    "recent work ( @xcite , @xcite ) has shown that cluster ` red sequences ' , the locus in the color ",
    "magnitude diagrams of the cluster early type galaxies , represent a remarkably stable feature which is detected up to @xmath85 redshifts ( e.g. on the @xmath86 cluster around 3c324 , dickinson 1995 ) .",
    "the red sequence is an excellent marker of the presence of a massive cluster , since galaxies with the colors and magnitudes of cluster early types are scarce among the general field population .    to examine the data for evidence of a cluster sequence",
    ", we have divided the frame into two regions , one corresponding to a 0.4h@xmath87mpc circular aperture at @xmath3 , centered on the luminous galaxy @xmath88 ( fig [ last]b ) , and an outer region covering the rest of the image . using the magnitude of galaxy @xmath88 as its zero - point ( @xmath89 , measured using the deconvolved images obtained in sec 6 ) , and adopting a slope of @xmath39 at @xmath3 ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the early - type sequence of such a cluster should lie at @xmath90 .",
    "fig [ spdis ] shows the positions of the galaxies with magnitudes compatible within their observational error with this relationship , and those of all the stars in the frame ( objects with class - star higher than 0.95 ) , independently of their color .",
    "it is obvious from this figure that a red sequence of galaxies is clustered around @xmath88 and also that galaxy @xmath88 lies on this sequence .",
    "the central region has @xmath91 such candidates ( excluding galaxy @xmath88 ) , whereas there are only other @xmath92 such galaxies on the rest of the frame .",
    "the central circle contains @xmath93 stars against @xmath94 detected in all the frame , i.e. the central region comprises only @xmath95 of the ` useful ' surface in the frame .",
    "thus , there is a factor @xmath96 overdensity of red galaxies in the central @xmath97 mpc , clear evidence of the existence of a galaxy cluster .",
    "a rough estimation of the significance of this result may be performed using a binomial distribution .",
    "the probability of having @xmath71 galaxies out of a total of @xmath98 within a region containing a fraction @xmath99 of the total surface is represented by @xmath100 . with @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , we find @xmath104 , corresponding to a confidence level of @xmath105 .",
    "fig [ vik ] shows that all but one of the cluster member candidates selected on the basis of the @xmath18 , @xmath22 are also very red in @xmath106 .",
    "this further supports that these galaxies are physically associated .",
    "independently , in addition to galaxy @xmath88 , two of our sequence galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts , and both are claimed to lie at @xmath107 ( kneib et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in the remainder of this paper",
    ", the galaxies listed in table 1 ( except the one which is not detected in the @xmath108band ) will be considered cluster members . to estimate their absolute magnitudes",
    "@xmath109 , we use a k - correction of @xmath110 at @xmath3 for evolved ellipticals ( poggianti 1997 ) , and a distance modulus of @xmath111 .",
    "galaxy @xmath88 has a de - reddened luminosity of @xmath112 , and the total luminosity of the detected cluster candidates is @xmath113 .",
    "our detection limit of @xmath114 corresponds to @xmath115 , so to compare this luminosity with the results of @xcite ( hereafter s97 ) , we correct it by integrating a schechter function up to @xmath116 , using @xmath117 and @xmath118 , measured by s97 at @xmath119 .",
    "the correction amounts to @xmath120 of the total light , and it is quite robust with respect to the exact value of @xmath121 , ranging from @xmath122 for @xmath123 to @xmath124 for @xmath125 .",
    "the adopted total luminosity for the cluster early type population is thus @xmath126 . in the cluster sample of s97",
    "the early types contain typically @xmath127 of the total cluster light .",
    "therefore , the total luminosity of the ` dark ' cluster would be @xmath128 .",
    "this value probably underestimates the cluster luminosity , as the fraction of cluster galaxies with star formation , and therefore bluer than the red cluster sequence , is likely to be higher at @xmath129 than at @xmath130 .",
    "h97 quote a value of @xmath131 for galaxy @xmath88 .",
    "as no other obvious cluster galaxy candidates were known , they adopted that value as the total luminosity . assuming a color of @xmath132 for an elliptical at redshift @xmath129",
    ", their value of @xmath133 would correspond to @xmath134 , an order of magnitude lower than our estimate of the total cluster light .",
    "we have reanalyzed the rosat - hri archival observations to examine the spatial relationship between the optical and x - ray emission .",
    "the hri dataset consists of three separate pointings with rosat i d : rh800811n00 , rh800811a01 , rh800811a02 with a total exposure time of 79 ksec .",
    "the x - ray photon files have been processed with standard iraf - pros routines filtering out time intervals with high background rate . the resulting coadded image with @xmath135 pixel size has an effective exposure time of 56.0 ksec , mostly contributed from the a01 and a02 observations .",
    "the astrometrical accuracy is found to be better than @xmath136 using 2 bright x - ray sources coincident with bright stars .",
    "a faint source at @xmath137 level is detected within @xmath138 of the position of the elliptical @xmath88 . a second source ( @xmath139 )",
    "is found @xmath140 ne .",
    "the latter seems to be missing in the original analysis by h97 .",
    "however , inspection of several images obtained by splitting the observation in two time intervals reveal variations in the flux of this source , suggesting that it might be either variable or spurious , whereas the central source shows a consistent flux .",
    "furthermore , the elliptical morphology of the central x - ray source is present in two independent pontings , suggesting that it is not an artifact of the background noise .",
    "this central source is the natural x - ray counterpart of the optical cluster and is likely coincident with the asca source of h97 .",
    "the central 3 arcmin of the hri field are shown in fig [ xray1 ] .",
    "corresponding x - ray contours are overlaid on the @xmath141 color image of the field in fig [ xray2 ] .",
    "we find @xmath142 net counts , or a count rate of @xmath143 cts s@xmath87 in the central source within a circle of @xmath144 radius ( @xmath145 h@xmath87  kpc at @xmath129 ) .",
    "the flux within a circle of @xmath146 falls short of the h97 estimate by a factor of two . using a galactic hydrogen column density of @xmath147 @xmath148 and a raymond - smith spectrum with @xmath149 kev , as measured by h97 , the program pimms for the hri yields that 1 cts / s is equivalent to an unabsorbed flux of @xmath150 in the @xmath151 kev band .",
    "the flux of the central source is @xmath152 , or an x - ray luminosity at @xmath129 , @xmath153 in the observed 0.1 - 2 kev band",
    ". the k - correction amounts to a factor 1.4 , whereas the conversion factor for the 2 - 10 kev band is @xmath154 . therefore , @xmath155 in the 2 - 10 kev rest frame band .",
    "this value is a factor 3 - 4 lower than the estimate by h97 , even with extrapolation of the flux out to @xmath146 using their assumed surface brightness profile .",
    "given the low signal - to - noise of the central source , it is not possible to assess its angular extent .",
    "this is shown visually in fig [ xray1 ] , where the hri psf has been used to simulate a source of 17 counts and added to the central region .",
    "the comparison between the surface brightness profiles of the central object and the point - like ( noise - less ) source is shown in fig [ xray3 ] , although at these low s / n levels , profile fitting is rather meaningless .",
    "the spatial analysis of h97 suggested an extended central source .",
    "this might be due to the large smoothing scale ( fwhm@xmath156 ) used by those authors or to a higher background of our combined x - ray image .",
    "the fact that the x - ray emission of a cluster at @xmath129 is unresolved with the hri is not surprising , given the severe surface surface brightness dimming at this redshift ( rosati et al .",
    "however , we can not rule out a significant contribution to the x - ray emission from the two lensed qso images .",
    "therefore , the aforementioned x - ray luminosity should be considered an upper limit .",
    "improved observations , ideally spatially resolved spectroscopy , should help to clarify the relation between the hot thermal spectrum observed by asca , with is low spatial resolution , and the patchy nature of the much better resolved rosat - hri map .",
    "assuming that the cluster is isothermal and in hydrostatic equilibrium , hattori et .",
    "estimate the gravitational mass within a radius of @xmath157 mpc to be @xmath158 , where the errors represent the uncertainty in the cluster temperature determination @xmath159kev .",
    "assuming @xmath160 , the mass inside a @xmath161mpc radius would be @xmath162 .",
    "this gives a mass to light ratio for axj2019 + 112 of @xmath163 and @xmath164 , compatible with the median values of @xmath130 clusters ( s97 ) : @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "the observations are of sufficient depth and resolution to allow a useful weak lensing analysis . the procedure for measuring",
    "the lensing signal is standard , and follows that employed in other cluster lensing studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "object finding and analysis employed the imcat software developed by n. kaiser ( @xcite  ksb ) .",
    "correction for psf anisotropy , and circularization due to seeing was made with the standard formalism of ksb and luppino / kaiser ( 1997 ) , with corrections noted in hoekstra et al .",
    "correction for these systematics is very robust , due to the very regular psf in the final coadded images , and the overabundance of stars in this field .",
    "the residual ellipticity in the corrected star catalog is less than 0.1% over the full field and so residual systematic shape distortion in the galaxy catalogs is completely negligible .    using the standard unbiased inversion algorithm ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the @xmath167-statistic , we determine the cluster surface density from the corrected galaxy shape measurements . for @xmath168 we find a _",
    "null _ detection of the cluster mass distribution , both in a 2d mass map , and in the radially averaged mass profile .",
    "this null detection allows us to place an interesting upper limit on the cluster mass , albeit in a model dependent fashion .",
    "for example , assuming the cluster follows a isothermal profile , @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the line of sight velocity dispersion , our data are of sufficient depth to detect the signal from a @xmath171 km / s singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) cluster at the @xmath172 level at @xmath173 and a @xmath174 level at @xmath175 , for @xmath176 in terms of mass , for a cluster with @xmath177 ( typical of clusters with @xmath178  kev ) this model yields @xmath179 where @xmath180 describes the average relative distance between the lens and the source galaxies . for @xmath181 and for plausible cosmologies and star formation models , @xmath180 , ranges between @xmath182 and @xmath183 , so the above result should be quite robust .",
    "this result sets the constraint @xmath184 independently of the x - ray and strong lensing estimates .",
    "the data can also be usefully used to study the immediate environment of the lens , which shows many interesting lensing features .",
    "first we deconvolve the keck @xmath21 and @xmath22 images using the mcs algorithm ( magain , courbin & sohy 1998 ) .",
    "since several individual dithered frames were available , the simultaneous deconvolution capability of the algorithm can be applied to improve not only the resolution of the images , but also the sampling .",
    "a total of four images were used in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 bands , which allows an effective reduction in the pixel size of the data to @xmath185 in the deconvolved combined image compared with the intrinsic instrumental scale of @xmath186 per pixel . in principle , the fundamental limitation in resolution is imposed by the nyquist frequency set by the _ adopted _ sampling in the deconvolved frame , i.e. 2 pixels fwhm . since the present images show sharp , high frequency structures , we found it reasonable to limit ourselves to a resolution of 3 pixels fwhm or @xmath187 in both bands and avoid to recover spurious high frequency spatial structure too close to the nyquist limit .",
    "note that this strict adherence of the deconvolution to this fundamental limitation distinguishes the mcs method from other deconvolution procedures where sharp noisy backgrounds are formed , generating spurious structure .",
    "the simultaneous deconvolution of the frames was performed in the same way as in courbin et al .",
    "( 1998a , b ) .",
    "the final deconvolved frames are displayed in fig . 8 together with the stacks of the 4 original images . given the low galactic latitude of q2016 + 112 , many stars are available in the immediate vicinity of our target .",
    "accurate psfs can therefore be constructed for all the images in the stack .",
    "the residual maps obtained after deconvolution were satisfactory for all frames in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 datasets .",
    "however , because the central part of the main lensing galaxy ( object @xmath88 ) is very sharp in the @xmath22 band , we choose to model it as a point source plus a diffuse background .",
    "this certainly does not mean that the core of the lens is actually a point source , we model it as such to exclude the spurious high spatial frequencies it would otherwise introduce .",
    "the deconvolution procedure returns the astrometry and photometry of the point sources and decomposes the final image into a sum of point sources plus a diffuse background .",
    "a major advantage over other deconvolution algorithms is that the resulting deconvolved images allow accurate aperture photometry for the extended objects , free of significant light contamination by bright point sources such as qsos .",
    "this decomposition capability allows us to derive accurate magnitudes for the lensing galaxy , especially in the @xmath21 band since it is heavily contaminated by image b at this wavelength .",
    "a summary of the photometry is given in table 2 , including the well resolved bright arc apparent below the two qso images as discussed further below .",
    "recent nicmos2 archival images ( i d : 7495 , p.i : falco , e. ) are consistent with the above deconvolution in the near - ir , showing very clearly the main arc below the central luminous galaxy , despite the poor point spread function of images taken prior to the refocusing of the instrument , indicating the arc is relatively red . the h band ( f160w ) image is shown in fig [ last]a for comparison .",
    "this extended ir feature was also noted by @xcite in high quality ground based ir images .",
    "the lens was originally discovered in the radio , as a close pair of bright flat spectrum sources ( lawrence et al 1984 ) separated by @xmath138 .",
    "these bright radio components , @xmath188 and @xmath189 , are accurately coincident with optical qsos ( schneider et al .",
    "1985 ) . a third radio image ,",
    "@xmath190 , ( fig [ last]a ) lies nearby and is resolved with vlbi into 4 knots along a line of only 0.1 arcsec .",
    "these knots have a flatter spectrum than @xmath188 or @xmath189 , so that their relation to the qso is not clear ( @xcite , @xcite , nair & garrett 1998 ) . in addition , image @xmath190 is coincident with the center of an arc found in @xmath108band imaging ( @xcite ) and clearly confirmed in an hst nicmos exposure shown in fig [ last]a .",
    "the optical counterpart of their @xmath108band arc is clearly seen in our deconvolved images , which show that it is resolved in the radial as well as the tangential direction .",
    "the redshift of both the lens and the source were measured by schneider et al .",
    "( 1985 ) to be @xmath3 and @xmath191 respectively .    here we show that the various images are relatively simply related if the lensed qso and its host galaxy lie close to the caustic of the lens , so that different parts of the source are magnified by different amounts .",
    "the lens model is kept as simple as possible .",
    "in addition to the usual choice of variables , i.e. position , position - angle , surface - density normalization and mass ellipticity , we also allow the slope of the mass distribution to vary .",
    "this is motivated in part by the recent realization that massive objects have central mass profiles which depart from the usual scaling solution ( huang & broadhurst 1998 ) becoming flatter in the core than an isothermal model , with a slope @xmath192 for the projected surface mass density distribution @xmath193 fig [ last]b shows our best fit for the lens features .",
    "all are easily reconciled in the context of this simple model , provided the slope of the mass distribution is relatively flat ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "the tolerance on the slope is roughly @xmath195 depending on the ellipticity .",
    "these two parameters can be traded over a limited range and reproduce the location of the three images and the position angle ( pa ) of the arc . fixing the ellipticity of the arc to match that of the optical light , @xmath196 , requires a slope @xmath197 .",
    "the central position and the pa of the mass distribution for the best fit are consistent with that of the central elliptical galaxy .",
    "the radial extent or thickness of the arc would be greater for a flat profile , where the magnification is given by for a power law , so the fact that object @xmath190 is resolved supports a flat central slope , assuming that the source is relatively symmetric .",
    "the radio and optical lensing features can be easily reconciled in more detail when the structure of an agn is considered . if the qso lies just outside the caustic then only two images of such a small source form in both the optical and the radio .",
    "the outer central region of the host galaxy must extend over the caustic so that the arc is a third image but only of the region of the host projected inside the caustic .",
    "this must also be true of the radio emission which lies in the center of the arc ; image @xmath190 arises naturally in the context of this model from extended radio emission which originates in a region closer to the qso than most of the optical arc light , but is spatially distinct from the qso since it must project inside the caustic .",
    "the best fit model magnification of the radio and optical images of the qso images , @xmath188 and @xmath189 , is 8.5 and 6 respectively .",
    "the magnification of the radio source @xmath190 is much greater .",
    "its location in the center of the arc means that this region of the radio emission straddles the caustic generating a high overall magnification of @xmath198 for the 4 knots .",
    "the radio emision could arise from within the generally diffuse radio emision typically found in the central kpc of an agn or may be an image of a jet .",
    "this model is most similar to that of @xcite , requiring the source to sit on the caustic , and quite unlike the multiple component model suggested by @xcite .",
    "the mass contained within the critical radius is virtually independent of the mass distribution , @xmath199 , depending somewhat on cosmology through the ratio of source - lens / source distances , due to the relatively high redshift of the lens .",
    "taking into account the luminosity of the central elliptical @xmath112 , the above value defines a very robust value of the mass  to  light ratio within the critical radius @xmath200 ,    interestingly the mass profile advocated by navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) tends to a similar flat slope at the critical radius , when integrated in projection @xmath201 , and normalized to the mass contained within the critical radius , for a reasonable choice of parameters , @xmath202 kpc and @xmath203 . extrapolating to larger radius using this profile yields a mass @xmath204 within a radius of @xmath161 mpc , assuming circular symmetry , considerably higher than an extrapolation of a purely isothermal profile , which has a steeper slope within this radius .",
    "this mass is compatible with the x - ray estimate of h97 , and yields a mass  to  light ratio of @xmath8 using our estimate of the cluster luminosity , where the uncertainty in the mass lies mainly with the unknown ellipticity of the mass distribution at large radius .",
    "we find clear evidence for a distant cluster of galaxies centered on the qso lens and luminous x - ray source axj2019 + 112 .",
    "a tight red sequence of galaxies is detected within a radius of @xmath2 mpc of the known @xmath3 elliptical lensing galaxy , with a color and slope indicative of a cluster at @xmath129 .",
    "we estimate the restframe v - band luminosity of the cluster early - types within a @xmath205 mpc aperture to be @xmath206 and the luminosity from all galaxy types to be @xmath207 .",
    "this is an order of magnitude larger than the luminosity estimations previously published for this cluster .",
    "if we use the x - ray mass estimations of h97 based on the estimated gas temperature , the mass  to  light ratio within @xmath6 mpc is @xmath208 , similar to massive @xmath130 clusters . from a weak lensing analysis",
    "it can also be established , independently of the x - ray mass estimate , that for an isothermal cluster @xmath209    the observation of a radially resolved optical arc in the cluster center and the detailed model fit to this and the two qso images requires that the core of the mass distribution is much flatter than isothermal .",
    "this analysis allows us to set a robust value of the mass  to  light ratio within the critical radius @xmath210 .",
    "the inferred surface mass distribution is very flat , @xmath211 , and consistent with the navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) profile for reasonable choices of the core radius and central density .",
    "an extrapolation of this profile to larger radius yields a mass  to  light ratio @xmath212 within a @xmath213 kpc aperture .",
    "we have reanalyzed the hri x - ray data and raise the possibility that the x - ray luminosity of the cluster should be significantly revised downward",
    ". a clear source of emission is spatially coincident with the cluster center .",
    "two other sources of emission are probably unrelated , but are smoothed together in the map of hattori et al ( 1997 ) comprising 50% of their x - ray flux estimate .",
    "furthermore we can not exclude the possibility that the lensed qso makes a significant contribution to the x - ray flux in the center .",
    "higher quality spatially resolved x - ray spectroscopy is needed to understand the relation between the large beam measurement of a hot thermal spectrum by asca and the clumpy nature of the higher resolution rosat - hri maps .",
    "deeper hst images would also be of interest in obtaining a better mass estimate for this cluster from weak lensing .",
    "less than a handful of massive clusters are known at @xmath13 , none of which have secure measurements of mass .",
