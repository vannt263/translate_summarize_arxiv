    "decoherence , resulting from the unavoidable and irreversible coupling of a quantum system to its environment , turns a correlated quantum state of the system into a classical statistical mixture @xcite .",
    "decoherence , causing usually a loss of quantum entanglement , is one of the major limitations of practical capabilities of quantum computers @xcite .",
    "thus , the analysis of the dynamics of entangled quantum two - level systems ( qubits ) coupled to the environment , represented by a thermal reservoir , is of a particular importance . in this paper",
    ", we will study the loss of the entanglement due to a dissipative nonlinear interaction of two optical qubits , which are implemented by superpositions of vacuum and single - photon states of two cavity modes , and assumed to be initially in the maximally entangled states ( mess ) or the maximally entangled mixed states ( memss ) .",
    "it is a well accepted fact that there is no unique way to quantify mixed - state entanglement and thus various measures with different operational interpretations have been proposed to describe different aspects of the entanglement .",
    "we will apply the concurrence @xcite , a measure related to the entanglement of formation @xcite , and the negativity @xcite , a measure corresponding to an operation - limited entanglement cost @xcite .",
    "we have chosen these particular measures as they are similar to each other from a physical point of view and , moreover , can easily be calculated contrary to other measures including the entanglement of distillation or the relative entropy of entanglement .",
    "our analysis is related to a new regime of quantum nonlinear optics involving highly - efficient nonlinear interactions between very weak optical fields , which has been recently demonstrated experimentally in , e.g. , dense atomic media by using an electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) to resonantly enhance nonlinearities ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , observation of giant kerr nonlinearities has been predicted @xcite and first measured in an ultracold gas of sodium atoms to be @xmath0 greater than those in the conventional optical materials @xcite .",
    "physical realizations of a kerr nonlinear cavity enabling strong interaction of photons was suggested by imamolu et al .",
    "@xcite and then studied by others @xcite .",
    "motivated by these advances , there is an increasing interest to apply the kerr nonlinearities for quantum information purposes @xcite , including the problem of generation of highly - entangled states ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , the effects of decoherence on the entanglement of fields interacting via the kerr nonlinearity have not been discussed in greater detail yet .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we define the entanglement measures to be used in our description of decoherence . the model and its solution for two optical qubits in a lossy nonlinear cavity",
    "are presented in section 3 .",
    "the main results concerning the decoherence of the qubits being initially in the maximally entangled states and the maximally entangled mixed states are presented in sections 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "a physical implementation of the model and discussion of the results are given in section  6 .",
    "we will apply two measures of entanglement to analyze the effect of decoherence on the entangled qubit states .",
    "the first measure is the concurrence defined for two qubits as  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath3 with @xmath4 being the pauli spin matrix of the @xmath5th qubit and the asterisk denotes complex conjugation .",
    "the entanglement of formation , @xmath6 , which characterizes the amount of entanglement necessary to create the entangled state @xcite , is for two qubits given by a simple monotonic function of the concurrence @xcite @xmath7\\ } \\label{n02}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the binary entropy .",
    "the entanglement of formation and , equivalently , the concurrence vanish for an unentangled state , and are equal to one for a maximally entangled state .",
    "a measure associated with the entanglement of formation is the entanglement cost defined as @xcite @xmath9 which , in general , is quite difficult to calculate .",
    "thus , for simplicity , we will describe the entanglement cost limited to a special class of operations to be specified in the following .",
    "another useful measure of the entanglement is the negativity @xcite , which corresponds to a quantitative version of the peres - horodecki criterion @xcite .",
    "we adopt here the following definition @xmath10 where the sum is taken over the negative eigenvalues @xmath11 of the partial transpose @xmath12 of the density matrix @xmath13 of the system . for two - qubit pure or mixed states , the sum in ( [ n03 ] ) can be skipped as @xmath12 has at most one negative eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "the negativity satisfies the standard conditions for a useful measure of the entanglement @xcite . for two - qubit states ,",
    "the negativity , defined by ( [ n03 ] ) , becomes 1 for a mes and vanishes for an unentangled state , the same as the concurrence .",
    "recently , audenaert et al . @xcite and supplementary ishizaka @xcite have provided an operational interpretation of the logarithmic negativity , defined by @xcite @xmath14 , \\label{n04}\\ ] ] as a measure of the entanglement cost for the exact preparation of a two - qubit quantum state @xmath13 under quantum operations preserving the positivity of the partial transpose ( ppt ) .",
    "for an arbitrary two - qubit pure state @xmath15 with the normalized complex amplitudes @xmath16 , we have the concurrence and negativity equal to each other and given by a simple formula @xmath17 however , for qubits in a mixed state , the entanglement measures are usually different . in general ,",
    "the inequality @xmath18 holds for an arbitrary two - qubit state @xmath13 as first observed by numerical investigation by eisert and plenio @xcite and yczkowski @xcite , and then proved by verstraete et al .",
    "@xcite ,    eisert and plenio @xcite raised an intriguing problem of the relativity of entanglement measures : if according to one measure of the entanglement the state @xmath19 is more entangled than @xmath20 then does it imply that @xmath19 is also more entangled than @xmath20 according to another entanglement measure ?",
    "by monte carlo simulation of thousands of two - qubit states , it was observed that indeed the condition @xmath21 can be violated by some states @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that this odd looking property is physically sound since such incomparable states @xmath19 and @xmath20 can not be transformed into each other with unit efficiency by any local quantum operations and classical communication ( lqcc ) . in general , all good asymptotic entanglement measures are either identical or put different orderings of quantum states as implied by the requirements of equivalence and continuity of the measures on pure states @xcite .",
    "thus , by comparing various entanglement measures defined to examine different methods of the entanglement preparation and/or its use , one indeed can arrive at the problem of different state orderings imposed by the measures .",
    "the only alternative to avoid the state - ordering ambiguity is to declare one entanglement measure for mixed states as the unique one , but this would preclude us from examining the problems of how to prepare the entanglement and how to make use of it @xcite . here , we will give simple analytical examples of states differently ordered by the concurrence and negativity , thus we will explicitly demonstrate the relativity of these entanglement measures .",
    "decoherence effects on optical modes ( qubits ) in a lossy nonlinear cavity can be described by a model of @xmath22 coupled dissipative nonlinear oscillators represented by the following prototype hamiltonian @xcite is sometimes defined in the normal - ordered form of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "one can observe that the evolution of the qubits in the nonlinear medium can lead to a periodical generation of entangled states .",

    "in particular , the initial state ( [ n16 ] ) with all the amplitudes equal to @xmath63 , i.e. , @xmath64 evolves into a maximally entangled state , defined below by ( [ n26 ] ) , having exactly 1 ebit at the evolution moments @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the mess are not generated if our system is subjected to dissipation .",

    "on the other hand , the initial bell states @xmath76 evolve in our lossy system into @xmath77 contrary to @xmath78 , the density matrices @xmath79 depend on the cross - coupling between the qubits .",

    "there are the following important properties of the discussed entanglement decays .",
    "first , the concurrence ( negativity ) for the initial bell states @xmath85 decays slower ( faster ) than that for @xmath86 , as it holds @xmath87 and @xmath88 for any damping constants @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) and any moments of time @xmath91 .",
    "thus , we provide an explicit example of states violating condition ( [ n07 ] ) .",
    "second , contrary to the density matrices , the entanglement measures are independent of the nonlinear couplings for the initial bell states ( [ n19 ] ) and ( [ n23 ] ) . thus , decoherence - free evolution in the nonlinear cavity does not change the entanglement , i.e. , @xmath92 .",
    "now we will give an example of a maximally entangled two - qubit state evolving in the kerr medium in such a way that the entanglement depends on the cross - coupling @xmath55 .",
    "let us analyze the following initial state @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",

    "equation ( [ n32 ] ) was derived by assuming only that the cross - coupling @xmath55 is much stronger than the damping constant @xmath123 , which implies that the function @xmath124 in the density matrix ( [ n27 ] ) approaches unity .",
    "the envelope functions , given by ( [ n31 ] ) and ( [ n32 ] ) , are depicted by curves ( e ) in figures 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "another simpler but far less accurate approximation of the negativity envelope function can be given by @xmath125 which was obtained by using the general properties of the eigenvalues @xmath126 of the partial transpose @xmath127 of density matrix ( [ n27 ] ) , including @xmath128 and @xmath129 , and observing that there exist two eigenvalues @xmath126 summing up approximately to zero .",
    "it is worth noting that the envelope functions , the same as those given by ( [ n31 ] ) and ( [ n32 ] ) , are for the system initially in the separable state given by ( [ n18 ] ) , for which @xmath130 has the form of ( [ n27 ] ) but with the functions @xmath124 and @xmath131 modified as follows @xmath132/(\\gamma -2i\\chi _ { 12})$ ] and @xmath133 . note also that the envelope functions ( [ n31])([n33 ] ) are independent of the cross - coupling @xmath55 under assumption @xmath134 but , even in this regime , the period of entanglement oscillations is a function of @xmath55 .",

    "we can finally conclude that @xmath139 where the equalities hold for the nonzero damping constant @xmath115 at the evolution moments @xmath83 and @xmath140 , while for @xmath141 at any times @xmath142 . inequalities ( [ n34])([n35 ] ) , except those for @xmath143 and @xmath144 , can be proved analytically , while the remaining inequalities were checked numerically for a large class of parameters .",
    "note that for small values of @xmath55 in comparison to @xmath115 it holds @xmath145 , nevertheless the last inequality in ( [ n35 ] ) is satisfied even if @xmath146 , and more pronounced for @xmath147 ( see figure 2 ) , which is the condition assumed in the derivation of ( [ n31])([n33 ] ) . obviously ,",
    "inequalities corresponding to ( [ n34 ] ) hold for the entanglement of formation , @xmath148 , and those corresponding to ( [ n35 ] ) are also valid for the ppt - entanglement cost , @xmath149 .",
    "the main conclusion is the following physical interpretation of inequalities ( [ n34])([n35 ] ) : by enabling kerr interactions between the qubits initially in the bell - like state , given by ( [ n26 ] ) , the loss of the entanglement can be periodically reduced .",
    "we will analyze the decoherence process of the initially maximally entangled mixed states of two qubits @xcite on the example of the werner states @xcite defined to be ( @xmath150 ) : @xmath151 where @xmath152 and @xmath153 are given by ( [ n19 ] ) and ( [ n23 ] ) , respectively , and @xmath154 are the identity 2x2 matrices .",
    "thus , the werner states are mixtures of a mes ( bell state ) and the maximally mixed state , given by @xmath155 , which can be interpreted as an equal incoherent mixture of the four bell states .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the standard two - qubit werner state is defined as @xmath156 only @xcite .",
    "this state , given in terms of the singlet state @xmath157 , is invariant if both qubits are subjected to same unitary transformation , @xmath158 . nevertheless , by ignoring the @xmath158 invariance but keeping the same entanglement properties , the standard werner state is often generalized ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) to include mixtures of any mess , as given by ( [ n36 ] ) and ( [ n37 ] ) .",
    "following this convention , we will apply the generalized definitions of werner states in our study .",
    "it is easy to show that the concurrences and negativities of the werner states are the same and given by @xmath159 the werner states can be considered the memss since their degree of entanglement can not be increased by any unitary operations @xcite and they have the maximum of entanglement for a given linear entropy ( and vice versa ) @xcite . in a special case of @xmath160 , the werner states go over into the mess .",

    "on the other hand , the evolution of @xmath164 from the initial werner state ( [ n37 ] ) reads as @xmath165 where @xmath166 and @xmath167 $ ] .",

    "let us finally address the question whether the interactions studied in this paper can be experimentally observable . as mentioned in introduction , the conditions assumed in the paper of the strong kerr interaction at low light intensities can be satisfied , e.g. , for the eit schemes as studied theoretically @xcite and confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "schmidt and imamolu @xcite have proposed a renown eit scheme where a low density cloud of cold atoms with the four - level structure , shown in figure 5 , exhibits giant resonantly - enhanced nonlinear cross - coupling with vanishing linear susceptibilities at low intensities . in the scheme , atoms are placed in a cavity ( or double cavity ) tuned to two frequencies : @xmath197 of the mode @xmath198 resonant with the transition @xmath199 , and @xmath200 of the mode @xmath201 detuned by @xmath202 of the transition @xmath203 .",

    "however , if the qubits placed in a lossy cavity are initially in the bell - like state @xmath232 or the corresponding werner - like state , the loss of entanglement can be periodically delayed ( partially recovered ) by inserting medium with the kerr nonlinearity .",
