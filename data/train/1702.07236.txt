    "dark matter ( dm ) is a leading candidate for physics beyond the standard model of particle physics . models based on the wimp paradigm are popular and have been widely studied . on the other hand , the recent dark matter direct detection experiments  @xcite",
    "give severe constraints on the models .",
    "it is possible to evade the constraints from the direct detection experiments if a dm candidate is a fermion and interacts with the standard model ( sm ) sector through pseudoscalar interactions  @xcite . in that case , the cross section for the direct detection is suppressed by the velocity of the dm and thus is negligible . on the other hand ,",
    "the same interactions are relevant to dm annihilation processes and we can obtain the dm thermal relic abundance that matches the measured value of the dm density .",
    "there are two simple ways to introduce the pseudoscalar interactions . one way is to add cp - odd scalar mediators that couple both to a dm candidate and the sm particles  @xcite . the other way is to introduce cp - violation into the dark sector . in the latter case , the sm higgs boson can be a mediator , and we do not need cp - odd scalar mediators .",
    "we focus on the latter possibility .",
    "we consider the singlet - doublet model  @xcite .",
    "this model is one of the minimal setups in simplified dark matter models with a fermionic dark matter candidate and has been widely studied  @xcite .",
    "the stability of dark matter is guaranteed by a @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "all the sm particles are @xmath0-even .",
    "there are a gauge singlet weyl fermion and an su(2 ) doublet dirac fermion .",
    "they are @xmath0-odd .",
    "the singlet , the doublet , and the higgs boson form yukawa interactions .",
    "there is a cp phase in the dark sector , and thus the model naturally contains a pseudoscalar interaction .",
    "the effect of this cp violation on the electron electric dipole moment ( edm ) was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , the cp violation effect on the dm phenomenology has hardly ever been discussed .",
    "gev , was discussed in  @xcite . ]    in this paper , we examine the effect of the cp violation in the model . in particular , we focus on its effect on the cross section for the direct detection .",
    "we show that the pseudoscalar interaction generated by the cp violation helps to evade the strong constraints from the direct detection experiments .",
    "we also investigate the electron edm with emphasis on the relation to the dm phenomenology .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we briefly review the singlet - doublet dark matter model . in section  3 ,",
    "we discuss the current constraints and prospects of this model from the viewpoint of dm direct searches and the electron edm .",
    "we devote section  4 to our conclusion .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the model .",
    "we introduce a gauge singlet majorana fermion ( @xmath1 ) and an su(2)@xmath2 doublet dirac fermion with hypercharge @xmath3 which is composed of a left - handed weyl fermion ( @xmath4 ) and a right - handed weyl fermion ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we impose a @xmath0 symmetry on the model . under the @xmath0 symmetry ,",
    "all the sm particles are even , and all the fermions we introduced in the above are odd . the lightest neutral @xmath0-odd fermion is a dm candidate .",
    "the mass and yukawa interaction terms for the @xmath0 odd particles are given by @xmath6 all the parameters have a cp violating phase in general , but we can eliminate three of them by the redefinition of the fermion fields .",
    "we work in the basis where only the dirac mass term has a phase , and we explicitly write down the phase as @xmath7 . in this basis , all the parameters except @xmath8 are positive . after the higgs field develops a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , we find the following mass terms @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the vev of the higgs boson , @xmath11 .",
    "we introduce @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 for later convenience,@xmath15 we find that the mass of the charged dirac fermion is @xmath16 .",
    "after we diagonalize the mass matrix , we obtain three neutral weyl fermions @xmath17 that are related to @xmath18 by a unitary matrix @xmath19 as follows .",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 is the lightest neutral @xmath0-odd field and thus is the dm candidate in this model .",
    "it is sufficient to study @xmath8 in the range @xmath22 , although @xmath23 in general .",
    "physics in the negative @xmath8 regime is related to physics in the positive @xmath8 regime by the complex conjugate of the mass matrix , and thus of the mixing matrix .",
    "if observables respect the cp symmetry , they do not depend on the sign of @xmath8 .",
    "all the processes for the relic abundance and the direct detection are independent of the sign of @xmath8 because they respect the cp symmetry .",
    "the edm is an observable to measure cp violation and thus depends on the sign of @xmath8 .",
    "however , the effect of changing the sign of @xmath8 is just to alter the sign of the edm .",
    "therefore we only focus on the positive @xmath8 region .",
    "the ratio of the two yukawa coupling is important as we will see below .",
    "we denote it by @xmath24 and focus on @xmath25 .",
    "since both of two yukawa couplings are positive , @xmath14 is positive definite . for @xmath26 , we can erase @xmath8 by the redefinition of the fermion fields .",
    "we do not discuss that situation because we aim to examine the cp violation effect in the dark sector .",
    "physics for @xmath27 is equivalent to physics for @xmath28 by renaming @xmath29 and @xmath30 as @xmath30 and @xmath29 respectively as can be seen from the mass matrix .",
    "therefore it is sufficient to discuss for @xmath25 .      the @xmath0-odd fermions couple to the higgs boson and the gauge bosons .",
    "we can obtain the interaction terms by diagonalizing the mass matrix and going to the mass eigenbasis .",
    "the four component notation is useful in calculations .",
    "the mass eigenstates of the charged and neutral @xmath0 odd particles in four component notation are given by @xmath31 the interaction terms including @xmath0-odd particles are @xmath32 where @xmath33 among these terms , the following interactions are particularly important for our discussion . @xmath34 all these three terms contribute to dm annihilation processes . on the other hand",
    ", they play different roles in elastic scattering processes of the dark matter with nucleon .",
    "the scalar interaction ( @xmath35 ) contributes to the spin - independent cross section ( @xmath36 ) , the @xmath37 interaction ( @xmath38 ) contributes to the spin - dependent cross section ( @xmath39 ) , and the pseudoscalar interaction ( @xmath40 ) does not contribute to the scattering process due to the velocity suppression .",
    "therefore , if the @xmath41 , then dm can completely evade the current strong constraints from the direct detection experiments .",
    "in addition , nonzero value of @xmath42 helps to keep the annihilation cross section of the dark matter to realize the thermal relic scenario .",
    "there are some symmetries that force @xmath43 and @xmath44 to be zero . in the cp invariant situations , @xmath45 or @xmath46 , then @xmath47 because the pseudoscalar interaction originates from the cp violation .",
    "if @xmath48 , then @xmath49 because the model becomes symmetric under the exchange of @xmath50 and @xmath30 as can be seen from eq .",
    "we can understand how this symmetry force @xmath49 as follows .",
    "this coupling originates from the dirac fermion coupling to @xmath37 boson given by @xmath51 it is clear that the exchanging symmetry for @xmath29 and @xmath30 forbids @xmath44 .",
    "therefore @xmath49 if @xmath48 .",
    "we can also obtain the same result by calculating @xmath44 directly . the exchanging symmetry for @xmath29 and @xmath30 implies @xmath52 , and thus @xmath49 as can be seen from eq .  .",
    "the scalar coupling @xmath53 can be zero as well . however ,",
    "in contrast to @xmath43 and @xmath44 , it becomes zero accidentally rather than by symmetries .",
    "we discuss the condition on the parameters for vanishing @xmath35 in the next subsection .",
    "there is a condition that the scalar interaction of the dm vanishes , @xmath54 .",
    "the condition is called the blind spot  @xcite . in this subsection",
    ", we discuss the condition for the blind spot .    for the purpose of finding the condition that @xmath55 , the expression of the scalar coupling given in eq .",
    "is not convenient .",
    "we can also obtain the scalar coupling from the derivative of the dark matter mass with respect to the vev of the higgs boson , @xmath56 .",
    "the expression obtained in this way is useful to find the blind spot .",
    "the dm mass satisfies the characteristic equation given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 . by differentiate this equation with respect to @xmath10 and setting @xmath59 , we find @xmath60 using eqs .   and",
    ", we can obtain two relations .",
    "for example , we can solve for @xmath61 and @xmath12 , @xmath62 this is the blind spot condition where @xmath54 .",
    "for @xmath45 , there is no blind spot because it requires @xmath63 . for @xmath64 ,",
    "@xmath61 is non - zero if the denominator of eq .",
    "is zero and we find the following blind spot condition for @xmath64 , @xmath65      this model predicts a new contribution to the edm because of the new cp violation source @xmath8 .",
