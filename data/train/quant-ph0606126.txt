    "quantum error correction ( qec )  @xcite and fault - tolerant quantum computation  @xcite demonstrate that quantum information can in principle be stored and manipulated coherently for arbitrarily long times despite the presence noise .",
    "the general framework of qec is the following .",
    "redundancy is introduced by encoding the information of system @xmath1 into a larger system @xmath2 .",
    "the image of @xmath1 in @xmath2 characterizes a code , while a particular embedding of @xmath1 into @xmath2 is called an encoding .",
    "the system @xmath2 is subjected to some noise .",
    "partial measurements whose outcomes are known as theerror syndrome \" are performed on @xmath2 . conditioned on this error syndrome , a recovery operation is applied to @xmath2 in order to restore its original information .",
    "this last step , called  decoding \" , is the subject of the present study .    in the absence of structure in the code , we know from a classical result  @xcite",
    "that finding the optimal recovery is np - hard . for practical purposes ,",
    "one must either use codes with lots of structure  which typically offer poorer performances  or settle for suboptimal recovery .",
    "residual errors after decoding are therefore of two varieties : those due to the information - theoretic limitations of the code and those arising from suboptimal decoding procedures . in the past decades",
    ", considerable progress has been made towards understanding this tradeoff in the classical setting ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "central to these advancements is the use of the message passing decoding algorithm pioneered by gallager @xcite which often leads to near - optimal decoding .",
    "this technique was recently introduced in the quantum realm by ollivier et al .",
    "@xcite for the decoding of low density parity check ( ldpc ) codes ( see also @xcite for related work ) .",
    "concatenation of block codes is widely used in quantum information science and is a key component of almost all fault tolerant schemes ( a noticeable exception is topological quantum computing  @xcite ) . as the name suggests , the system @xmath2 that redundantly encodes the information of system @xmath1 can itself be encoded in a yet larger system @xmath3 , adding an extra layer of redundancy .",
    "provided the initial error rate is below a threshold value , every extra level of concatenation should reduce the probability of error after decoding , so concatenation can in principle be repeated until the error is below any desired value .    in this article , we demonstrate an efficient message passing algorithm that achieves optimal ( maximum likelihood ) decoding for _ concatenated block codes _ with uncorrelated noise .",
    "we numerically investigate the message passing algorithm using the 5 qubit code @xcite and steane s 7 qubit code @xcite and compare their performances to the commonly used blockwise minimal - distance decoder ( based on a local rather than global optimization ) .",
    "the advantages of the message passing algorithm are substantial . on the one hand , for the 5 qubit code used on a depolarizing channel",
    ", the message passing algorithm can correctly decode the information for a noise level up to at least 0.1885 ( the exact threshold is probably the hashing bound @xmath4 ) compared to the values 0.1376 previously established using blockwise decoding @xcite .",
    "for steane s code , this enhancement is even greater going from 0.0969 @xcite to at least 0.188 . on the other hand , away from these noise thresholds , the probability of error decreases at a significantly higher rate using optimal decoding .",
    "for instance , for a 0.1 depolarizing channel and using 4 levels of concatenation of the 5 qubit code , the probabilities that the blockwise decoding and the optimal decoding fail to correctly identify the error differ by more that 3 orders of magnitude . as a consequence , a decoding error probability @xmath5 for any @xmath6",
    "can be achieved with a substantially reduced error correction overhead .",
    "our presentation of the stabilizer formalism follows @xcite , see @xcite for the general theory .",
    "denote by @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 the three pauli matrices and by @xmath10 the @xmath11 identity matrix .",
    "the group @xmath12 is the multiplicative group generated by the pauli matrices and the imaginary unit @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath14-qubit pauli group @xmath15 is the @xmath14-fold tensor product of @xmath12 .",
    "we denote @xmath16 the pauli matrix @xmath7 acting on the @xmath17th qubit for @xmath18 and similarly for @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "note that the @xmath16 s and the @xmath19 s are a generating set of @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath20 . the clifford group on @xmath14 qubits @xmath21 is the largest subgroup of the unitary group @xmath22 that maps @xmath15 to itself under the adjoint action .",
    "the encoding of @xmath23 qubits into @xmath14 qubits can be specified by a matrix @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is a unitary matrix acting on @xmath14 qubits that are distributed in 3 different sets .",
    "the first @xmath23  logical \" qubits contain the information to be encoded in the @xmath14 qubits ; the next @xmath26  stabilizer \" qubits are set to the state @xmath27 ; and finally the remaining @xmath28  gauge \" qubits are in arbitrary states . the image of the pauli operators acting on the first @xmath23 qubits are known as logical pauli operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the image of the @xmath9 pauli operators acting on qubits @xmath31 are called stabilizer generators @xmath32 whereas the image of the @xmath7 operators acting on those qubits are called pure errors @xmath33 . finally , the image of the pauli operators acting on the remaining @xmath34 qubits are called gauge operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the stabilizer generators @xmath37 mutually commute , so can be simultaneously measured .",
    "the outcome of that measurement is called the error syndrome @xmath38 .",
    "since the @xmath26 stabilizer qubits are all in state @xmath39 prior to encoding , we conclude that in the absence of noise the encoded state should be a @xmath40 eigenstate of all stabilizer generators , thus the error syndrome should be all ones .",
    "a non - trivial syndrome therefore indicates that an error has corrupted the register , and the task of decoding consists in finding the optimal recovery procedure given an error syndrome .",
    "to address the decoding problem , note that @xmath41 .",
    "in other words , any element @xmath42 can be written , up to an irrelevant phase , as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a product of logical pauli operators , @xmath45 is a product of pure errors , and @xmath46 is a product of gauge operators and stabilizer elements .",
    "moreover , this decomposition can be found by running the circuit @xmath25 backward , which is efficient since @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "@xmath45 is completely determined by the syndrome : @xmath47 appears in @xmath45 if and only if the @xmath17th syndrome bit is @xmath48 .",
    "the value of @xmath46 is irrelevant because the information encoded in the @xmath14 qubits is invariant under the action of any @xmath46 .",
    "this reflects the fact that the stabilizer qubits are initially set to @xmath39 and that the gauge qubits are in random states .",
    "thus , to undo the effect of an error @xmath49 , one needs to identify the most likely value of @xmath50 given @xmath51 , or equivalently given @xmath52 .    for simplicity , we will focus on pauli channels where errors @xmath49 are elements of @xmath15 distributed according to @xmath53 . given this probability @xmath53 over",
    "@xmath15 one can compute the conditional probability @xmath54 using @xmath55\\delta[\\cl(e ) = l ] p(e ) \\\\ & = & \\sum_g p(e = ltg ) , \\label{eq : prob_block}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 denotes the indicator function and @xmath57 takes all possible combinations of stabilizer generators and gauge operators .",
    "given a finite block size @xmath14 , these probabilities can be computed and the optimal decoding @xmath58 can be evaluated .",
    "decoding a block code thus consists of looking in a table containing the values of @xmath59 for each @xmath60 .",
    "typically  and in particular for a non - degenerate code over the depolarization channel  @xmath59 corresponds to the minimal distance decoder @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the error acting on the fewest number of qubits and that is compatible with the observed syndrome .",
    "concatenation is realized by encoding the @xmath14 qubits of the code in an other code .",
    "there is no need for this other code to be identical to the original one .",
    "however to simplify the presentation , we will assume that the same code is used at every concatenation layer and that it encodes a single qubit in @xmath14 qubits ; generalizations are straightforward .",
    "this procedure can be repeated @xmath63 times at the expense of an exponentially growing number of physical qubits @xmath64 .",
    "the number of stabilizer generators grows roughly as @xmath65 ( it is a geometric sum ) ; thus the syndrome can take @xmath66 different values .",
    "thus , even for moderate values of @xmath63 , it is not feasible to construct a lookup table giving the optimal decoding procedure for each syndrome value .    what is generally done to circumvent this double exponential blowup",
    "is to apply the optimal recovery _",
    "independently for each concatenation layer _ ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap . 6 ) and references therein ) .",
    "one first measures the syndrome from each of the @xmath67 blocks of @xmath14 qubits of the last layer of concatenation , and optimally decodes them using the lookup table .",
    "one then moves one layer up and applies the same procedure to the @xmath68 blocks of the second - to - last layer , etc .",
    "when the initial error rate is below a certain threshold value , the probability @xmath69 that this procedure fails to correctly identify @xmath44 decreases doubly - exponentially with @xmath63 .",
    "hence , this decoding scheme based on hard decisions for each concatenation layer is efficient , leads to a good error suppression , but is nonetheless suboptimal .",
    "let @xmath70 be the syndrome of the @xmath17th block of the @xmath71th concatenation layer .",
    "denote @xmath72 the collection of syndromes whose stabilizers act non - trivially on the physical qubits associated to the @xmath17th block of the @xmath71th concatenation layer : these sets can be defined recursively by @xmath73 with the initialization @xmath74 .",
    "finally , denote @xmath75 all the syndromes from the layers @xmath71 to @xmath63 .",
    "( see the above figure for a pictorial representation of @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . ) then , @xmath79 is the set of all syndromes and maximum likelihood decoding consists in finding @xmath80 .",
    "this probability can be factorized by conditioning on the logical errors of the second layer @xmath81 :    @xmath82   \\frac{p(\\bl_2,\\bs_1)}{p(\\bs_1 ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{\\bl_2 } \\delta[l_1 =   \\cl(\\bl_2 ) ]   \\frac{p(s_1|\\bl_2,\\bs_2)p(\\bl_2,\\bs_2)}{p(s_1,\\bs_2 ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{\\bl_2 } \\delta[l_1 =   \\cl(\\bl_2 ) ] \\delta[s_1 = \\cs(\\bl_2 ) ] \\frac{p(\\bl_2|\\bs_2 ) p(\\bs_2)}{p(s_1,\\bs_2 ) } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_{\\bl_2 } \\frac{\\delta[l_1 =   \\cl(\\bl_2 ) ] \\delta[s_1 = \\cs(\\bl_2)]}{p(s_1|\\bs_2 ) } \\prod_{j=1}^n p(l^{(j)}_2|\\bs^{(j)}_2 ) .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    above , @xmath83 denotes the syndrome associated to the error pattern @xmath84 .",
    "this series of manipulations repeatedly uses bayes rule and the fact that the syndrome and logical error of level @xmath71 are completely determined given the logical errors of layer @xmath85 .",
    "the last step relies on the important assumption that the channel is memoryless , or more specifically , that the noise model does not correlate qubits across distinct blocks ( errors on qubits in the same block could be correlated ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : factor ] ) shows that by conditioning on the logical errors of each concatenation layer , the _ factor graph _ associated to the function @xmath86 is a tree , as depicted in the above graph .",
    "we have thus reduced optimal decoding to a sum product problem ( known as tensor network contraction in quantum information science @xcite ) on a tree graph which can be solved exactly and efficiently in the number of variables using a message passing algorithm ( also known as belief propagation ) ; see @xcite , and references therein .",
    "let us describe this algorithm in a general setting .",
    "the factor graph is a bipartite graph , and vertices from the two partitions are decorated with circles and boxes .",
    "circle vertices are labeled @xmath87 and each one carries a variable @xmath88 with value in a discrete set .",
    "box vertices are labeled @xmath89 , and each one contains a function @xmath90 that depends on the variables @xmath88 from the adjacent circles @xmath91 , collectively denoted @xmath92 .",
    "the goal is to compute marginals @xmath93 where @xmath94 indicates that @xmath88 is omitted from the set and @xmath9 is a normalization factor . to this end , messages @xmath95",
    "are passed from the circles to the boxes and messages @xmath96 are passed from the boxes to the circles following the rules @xmath97,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 means all neighbors of @xmath99 excluding @xmath100 , and similarly for @xmath101 .",
    "note that these messages are functions of the discrete variables @xmath88 ( i.e. they are vectors ) .",
    "the @xmath95 messages are initialized to the constant function 1 . for a tree graph",
    ", the desired marginal is obtained from these messages after a number of steps equal to the depth of the variable @xmath88 and is given by @xmath102 , where @xmath23 is a normalization factor .    in the case of interest , circles carry logical operators and a box labeled @xmath103 carries the function @xmath104\\delta[s_{m+1}^{(j ) } = \\cs(l_m^{(nj - n+1)},\\ldots , l_m^{(nj)})]$ ] , where the syndrome is fixed by the measurements . to complete the picture , extra box vertices carrying the function eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob_block ] ) need to be attached to the bottom leaves of the graph .",
    "the factor @xmath105 can be evaluated by normalizing the obtained distribution .",
    "thus , we can efficiently evaluate @xmath106 , for all @xmath103 .",
    "computing only @xmath106 leads to simplification of the message passing rules ; in particular , messages need only to flow from the bottom to the top of the graph . ] and the optimal recovery is the @xmath107 maximizing this function .",
    "the advantage of the message passing algorithm over the minimal distance decoder comes from the fact that it does not throw away useful information @xcite . instead of computing the most likely recovery and passing it on to the next level of coding",
    ", the entire list of probability of possible recoveries , conditioned on the observed syndrome , is passed on .",
    "in other words , the original channel is composed with the syndrome measurement , and projected onto the logical algebra to yield a  conditionally renormalized \" channel .",
    "following the tradition for benchmarking qec techniques , we investigate the performance of the message passing decoding algorithm using a depolarization channel , where each qubit is independently subjected to the channel @xmath108 we use the 5 qubit code @xcite concatenated with itself up to @xmath109 times , for an overhead of 9,765,625 physical qubits per logical qubit .",
    "pauli errors @xmath110 are generated by picking each @xmath14 single - qubit operator independently according to the probability @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "the associated logical error @xmath44 and syndromes @xmath113 are computed exactly .",
    "these syndromes are used by a blockwise decoding routine yielding an estimate @xmath114 and by a message passing routine yielding the optimal decoding @xmath115 .",
    "a decoding is declared incorrect when its estimate differs from @xmath44 .",
    "this is repeated a large number of times ( @xmath116 ) to evaluate the probability @xmath69 that the decoding gives an incorrect estimate .     as a function of the level of concatenation @xmath63 for different depolarization rate @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the diamonds are from the message passing algorithm , and the circles are from the blockwise decoding .",
    "all data are from samples of @xmath119 encoded qubits.,height=201 ]    figure  [ fig : flow ] shows the probability of incorrect decoding @xmath69 for both the blockwise and the optimal decoding as a function of the level of concatenation @xmath63 and for different channel parameters @xmath120 ranging from 0.13 to 0.19 . for the blockwise decoding , @xmath69 ceases to decrease with @xmath63 for values of @xmath121 .",
    "this reflects the fact that the threshold of this decoding technique for this particular code is about 0.1376 @xcite , so all curves except the 0.13 one are above the threshold . on the other hand ,",
    "optimal decoding succeeds in decreasing the error probability for values of @xmath120 up to at least 0.1885 , but appears to fail at @xmath122 .",
    "we conjecture that the exact value of this threshold is the hashing bound @xmath123 , where the single - qubit coherent information vanishes and is the highest threshold any non degenerate code can achieve @xcite .",
    "results obtained from steane s code @xcite show a quite similar behavior , with at least 94@xmath0 increase of threshold going from 0.0969 @xcite to at least 0.188 and appears to fail at 0.1885 .",
    "an interesting feature of the @xmath124 curves obtained from optimal decoding is their non - monotonicity .",
    "blockwise decoding , on the other hand , always yields monotonic curves for this type of channel ; thus its global behavior under concatenation can be predicted from a single level of coding .",
    "this is because decoding is performed independently on each concatenation layer . with the optimal decoder , information about the syndromes",
    "is propagated from one layer of concatenation to the next through the conditionally - renormalized channel that ceases to be depolarizing and varies from one qubit to the other .",
    "thus , non - monotonicity of the @xmath124 curves is a signature of the global optimization performed by the message passing algorithm .     for @xmath125 and 0.05 .",
    "diamonds obtained from samples of @xmath126 encoded qubits .",
    "circle were produced using an exact numerical technique similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite.,height=201 ]    figure  [ fig : exponential ] shows the behavior of @xmath69 as a function of @xmath63 away from the threshold values , i.e. in the natural operating regime of the code .",
    "again , the advantages of the message passing algorithm are considerable . after 4 rounds of concatenation for @xmath125 ,",
    "message passing fails with a probability of roughly @xmath127 , whereas this probability is well above @xmath128 for blockwise hard decoding .",
    "it takes @xmath129 layers of concatenation for the blockwise decoding to reach comparable performances .",
    "again , results obtained from steane s code show an even larger gap .",
    "finally , we once again stress that the message passing outputs the probability of an error @xmath130 rather than a particular value of @xmath130 . a hard decision can then be made based on this probability .",
    "we observe that when decoding succeeds , @xmath131 is typically very close to one ( e.g. 0.999 for @xmath132 ) whereas when it fails it is relatively low ( typically 0.7 ) ; the algorithm knows that it is failing . this  flagging \" of errors offers a great advantage when post - selection is an option .",
    "the possibility of operating the algorithm with soft inputs , i.e. noisy syndrome measurements , is also of interest in several circumstances .",
    "we have demonstrated an efficient message passing algorithm for the optimal decoding of concatenated quantum block codes on a memoryless channels .",
    "numerical results show substantial benefits of our approach over the widely used blockwise hard decoding , including an increase of error thresholds and a greater error suppression rate .",
    "message passing algorithms have been used on graphs with loops ( describing e.g. ldpc codes , turbo - codes , or channels with memory ) and often yield near - optimal decoding .",
    "the quantum generalization of these schemes , including quantum ldpc codes @xcite and quantum turbo - codes @xcite , are promising avenues for the realization of a quantum information technologies .",
    "techniques reminiscent of message passing have been used to beat the hashing bound but were not efficiently implementable  @xcite : efficient decoding may now be within reach using our techniques .",
    "a  hard \" message passing scheme was also used in @xcite to obtain high fault - tolerant error thresholds : a full - fledge message passing scheme  although not optimal for correlated errors that are typically present in fault - tolerant schemes  should further improve this threshold and may significantly reduce the resource overhead .",
