    "quantum coherence is at the very heart of many intriguing phenomena in today s nanostructures @xcite .",
    "for example , it is the essential ingredient to the understanding of the famous aharonov - bohm like interference oscillations of the conductance of metallic rings @xcite or the well - known conductance steps in quasi one - dimensional wires @xcite .",
    "in particular , nonequilibrium electronic transport has emerged as a versatile tool to gain deep insights into the coherent quantum properties of mesoscopic solid - state devices @xcite . here , with the prospect of spintronics and applications in quantum computing ,",
    "a great deal of research has been directed towards the interplay and feedback mechanisms between electron and nuclear spins in gate - based semiconductor quantum dots @xcite .",
    "current fluctuations have been assigned to the random dynamics of the ambient nuclear spins @xcite and/or hysteresis effects due to dynamic nuclear polarization @xcite .",
    "spin - flip mediated transport , realized in few - electron quantum dots in the so - called spin - blockade regime @xcite , has been shown to exhibit long time scale oscillations and bistability as a result of a buildup and relaxation of nuclear polarization @xcite .",
    "the nuclear spins are known to act collectively on the electron spin via hyperfine interaction . in principle , this opens up an exciting testbed for the observation of collective effects which play a remarkable role in a wide range of many - body physics @xcite .    in quantum optics ,",
    "the concept of superradiance , describing the cooperative emission of photons , is a paradigm example for a cooperative quantum effect @xcite . here ,",
    "initially excited atoms emit photons collectively as a result of the buildup and reinforcement of strong interatomic correlations .",
    "its most prominent feature is an emission intensity burst in which the system radiates much faster than an otherwise identical system of independent emitters .",
    "this phenomenon is of fundamental importance in quantum optics and has been studied extensively since its first prediction by dicke in 1954 @xcite . yet , in its original form the observation of optical superradiance has turned out to be difficult due to dephasing dipole - dipole van der waals interactions , which suppress a coherence buildup in atomic ensembles .",
    "this paper is built upon analogies between mesoscopic solid - state physics and quantum optics : the nuclear spins surrounding a qd are identified with an atomic ensemble , individual nuclear spins corresponding to the internal levels of a single atom and the electrons are associated with photons . despite some fundamental differences  for example , electrons are fermions , whereas photons are bosonic particles  this analogy stimulates conjectures about the potential occurence of related phenomena in these two fields of physics . led by this line of thought , we will address the question if superradiant behaviour might also be observed in a solid - state environment where the role of photons is played by electrons .",
    "to this end , we analyze a gate - based semiconductor qd in the coulomb blockade regime , obtaining two main results , of both experimental and theoretical relevance : first , in analogy to superradiant emission of photons , we show how to observe superradiant emission of electrons in a transport setting through a qd . we demonstrate that the proposed setup , when tuned into the spin - blockade regime , carries clear fingerprints of cooperative emission , with no van der waals dephasing mechanism on relevant timescales .",
    "the spin - blockade is lifted by the hf coupling which becomes increasingly more efficient as correlations among the nuclear spins build up .",
    "this markedly enhances the spin - flip rate and hence the leakage current running through the qd .",
    "second , we develop a general theoretical master equation framework that describes the nuclear spin mediated transport through a single qd .",
    "apart from the collective effects due to the hf interaction , the electronic tunneling current is shown to depend on the internal state of the ambient nuclear spins through the effective magnetic field ( overhauser field ) produced by the hyperfine interaction .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : executive - summary ] , we highlight our key findings and provide an intuitive picture of our basic ideas , allowing the reader to grasp our main results on a qualitative level . by defining the underlying hamiltonian , sec .  [",
    "sec : system ] then describes the system in a more rigorous fashion .",
    "next , we present the first main result of this paper in sec .",
    "[ sec : qme ] : a general master equation for electron transport through a single qd which is coherently enhanced by the hf interaction with the ambient nuclear spins in the qd .",
    "it features both collective effects and feedback mechanisms between the electronic and the nuclear subsystem of the qd .",
    "based on this theoretical framework , sec .",
    "[ sec : superradiance ] puts forward the second main result , namely the observation of superradiant behavior in the leakage current through a qd . the qualitative explanations provided in sec .",

    "[ sec : analysis - and - numerical - results ] backs up our analytical predictions with numerical simulations .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] we draw conclusions and give an outlook on future directions of research .",
    "( color online ) . schematic illustration of the transport system : an electrically defined qd is tunnel - coupled to two electron reservoirs , the left and right lead respectively .",
    "a bias voltage @xmath0 is applied between the two leads in order to induce a current through the qd .",
    "an external magnetic field is used to tune the system into the sequential - tunneling regime and the qd effectively acts as an spin - filter .",
    "the resulting spin - blockade can be lifted by the hf interaction between the qd electron and the nuclear spins in the surrounding host environment . ]    in this section we provide an intuitive exposition of our key ideas and summarize our main findings .",
    "we study a single electrically - defined qd in the coulomb - blockade regime which is attached to two leads , as schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] .",
    "formally , the hamiltonian for the total system is given by @xmath1 here , @xmath2 describes the zeeman splitting of the electronic levels inside the qd in presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "@xmath3 refers to two independent reservoirs of non - interacting electrons , the left and right lead respectively .",
    "the coupling between these and the qd is described in terms of a tunneling hamiltonian @xmath4 and @xmath5 models the _ collective _ interaction between an electron confined inside the qd and an ensemble of @xmath6 proximal nuclear spins surrounding the qd .",
    "note that the specific form of @xmath7 will be given later on in sec .",
    "[ sec : system ] .",
    "our analysis is built upon a quantum master equation approach , a technique originally rooted in the field of quantum optics . by tracing out the unobserved degrees of freedom of the leads",
    "we derive an effective equation of motion for the density matrix of the qd system @xmath8  describing the electron spin inside the qd as well as the nuclear spin ensemble  irreversibly coupled to source and drain electron reservoirs .",
    "in addition to the standard assumptions of a weak system - reservoir coupling ( born approximation ) , a flat reservoir spectral density , and a short reservoir correlation time ( markov approximation ) , we demand the hyperfine flip - flops to be strongly detuned with respect to the effective magnetic field seen by the electron throughout the dynamics . under these conditions , the central master equation can be written as @xmath9 \\\\   &   & + \\sum_{\\sigma=\\uparrow,\\downarrow}\\alpha_{\\sigma}\\left(t\\right)\\left[d_{\\sigma}\\rho_{s}\\left(t\\right)d_{\\sigma}^{\\dagger}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\ { d_{\\sigma}^{\\dagger}d_{\\sigma},\\rho_{s}\\left(t\\right)\\right\\ } \\right]\\nonumber \\\\   &   & + \\sum_{\\sigma=\\uparrow,\\downarrow}\\beta_{\\sigma}\\left(t\\right)\\left[d_{\\sigma}^{\\dagger}\\rho_{s}\\left(t\\right)d_{\\sigma}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\ { d_{\\sigma}d_{\\sigma}^{\\dagger},\\rho_{s}\\left(t\\right)\\right\\ } \\right ] , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the tunneling rates @xmath10 and @xmath11 describe dissipative processes by which an electron of spin @xmath12 tunnels from one of the leads into or out of the qd , respectively . here , the fermionic operator @xmath13 creates an electron of spin @xmath12 inside the qd . while a detailed derivation of eqn .",
    "along with the precise form of the tunneling rates is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : qme ] , here we focus on a qualitative discussion of the theoretical and experimental implications thereof .",
    "our central master equation exhibits two core features : first , dissipation only acts on the electronic subsystem with rates @xmath10 and @xmath11 that depend dynamically on the state of the nuclear subsystem .",
    "this non - linear behavior potentially results in hysteretic behavior and feedback mechanisms between the two subsystems as already suggested theoretically @xcite and observed in experiments in the context of double qds in the pauli - blockade regime ; see e.g. refs .",
    "second , the collective nature of the hf interaction @xmath5 allows for the observation of coherent many - body effects .",
    "the effect of the hyperfine interaction between an electron inside the qd and the ambient nuclear spin ensemble is two - fold giving rise to the two main results outlined above : first , the nuclear spins provide an effective magnetic field for the electron spin , the overhauser field , whose strength is proportional to the polarization of the nuclear spin ensemble .",
    "thus , a changing nuclear polarization can either dynamically tune or detune the position of the electron levels inside the qd .",
    "this , in turn , can have a marked effect on the transport properties of the qd as they crucially depend on the position of these resonances with respect to the chemical potentials of the leads . in our model , this effect is directly captured by the tunneling rates dynamically depending on the state of the nuclei .",
    "second , to show that this system supports the observation of intriguing , purely collective effects we refer to the following example : consider a setting in which the bias voltage and an external magnetic field are tuned such that only one of the two electronic spin - components , say the level @xmath14 , lies inside the transport window . in this spin - blockade regime",
    "the electrons tunneling into the right lead are spin - polarized , i.e. , the qd acts as an spin filter @xcite .",
    "if the hf coupling is sufficiently small compared to the external zeeman splitting , the electron is predominantly in its @xmath15 spin state allowing to adiabatically eliminate the electronic qd coordinates . in this way",
    "we obtain an effective equation of motion for the nuclear density operator @xmath16 only .",
    "it reads @xmath17\\nonumber \\\\   &   & + ic_{i}\\left[a^{+}a^{-},\\mu\\right]+i\\frac{g}{2}\\left[a^{z},\\mu\\right],\\label{eq : qme - nuclear - spins}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 with @xmath19 are _ collective _ nuclear spin operators , composed of _ all _ @xmath6 individual nuclear spin operators @xmath20 , with @xmath21 being proportional to the probability of the electron being at the location of the nucleus of site @xmath22 .",
    "again , we will highlight the core implications of eqn . and for a full derivation thereof , including the definition of the effective rates @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we refer to sec .  [",
    "sec : superradiance ] .",
    "most notably , eqn . closely resembles the superradiance master equation which has been discussed extensively in the context of atomic physics @xcite and therefore similar effects might be expected .",

    "normalized leakage current through a qd in the spin - blockade regime for @xmath6 nuclear spins , initial nuclear polarization @xmath25 and external zeeman splitting @xmath26 in units of the total hf coupling constant @xmath27 , summarized as @xmath28 . for homogeneous hf coupling the dynamics can be solved exactly ( black dotted line ) . compared to this idealized benchmark",
    ", the effects are reduced for realistic inhomogeneous hf coupling , but still present : the relative peak height becomes more pronounced for smaller detuning @xmath26 or higher polarization @xmath25 ( solid red line compared to the blue dashed and green dash - dotted line , respectively ) . even under realistic conditions ,",
    "the relative peak height is found to scale linearly with @xmath6 , corresponding to a strong enhancement for typically @xmath29 . ]",
    "superradiance is known as a macroscopic collective phenomenon which generalizes spontaneous emission from a single emitter to a many - body system of @xmath6 atoms @xcite .",
    "starting from a fully polarized initial state the system evolves within a totally symmetric subspace under permutation and experiences a strong correlation build - up . as a consequence ,",
    "the emission intensity is not of the usual exponentially decaying form , but conversely features a sudden peak occuring on a very rapid timescale @xmath30 with a maximum @xmath31 . in this paper , we show that the same type of cooperative emission can occur from an ensemble of nuclear spins surrounding an electrically - defined qd , a phenomenon we term as _ electronic superradiance _ : the spin - blockade can be lifted by the hf interaction as the nuclei pump excitations into the electron .",
    "when starting from a highly polarized , weakly correlated nuclear state , due to the collective nature of the hf interaction , this process becomes increasingly more efficient as correlations among the nuclei build up , directly giving rise to an increased leakage current .",
    "therefore , the current is collectively enhanced by the electron s hf interaction with the ambient nuclear spin ensemble giving rise to the pure many - body effect of electronic superradiance .    compared to its conventional atomic counterpart ,",
    "our system incorporates two major differences : first , our setup describes superradiant behaviour from a _ single _ emitter , since in the strong coulomb - blockade regime the electrons are emitted antibunched . as described above , the superradiant character is due to the nuclear spins acting collectively on the electron spin leading to an increased leakage current on timescales longer than single electron tunneling events .",
    "the second crucial difference is the _ inhomogeneous _ nature @xmath32 of the collective operators @xmath33 .",
    "accordingly , the collective spin is not conserved , leading to dephasing between the nuclei which in principle could prevent the observation of superradiant behavior . however , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : sr ] , we show that under realistic conditions  taking into account a finite initial polarization of nuclear spins @xmath25 and dephasing processes due to the inhomogeneous nature of the hf coupling  the leakage current through the qd still exhibits the characteristic peak whose relative height will be shown to scale linealry with the number of nuclear spins .",
    "even though the effect is reduced compared to the ideal atomic case , for an experimentally realistic number of nuclei @xmath29 a strong increase is still predicted .",
    "the experimental key signature of this effect , the relative peak height of the leakage current , can be varied by either tuning the external zeeman splitting or the initial polarization of the nuclear spins .    in the remainder of the paper , eqn . and eqn .",
    "will be derived from first principles ; in particular , the underlying assumptions and approximations will be listed .",
    "based on this general theoretical framework , more results along with detailed discussions will be presented .",
    "for both the idealized case of homogeneous hf coupling  in which an exact solution is feasible even for relatively large @xmath6  and the more realistic inhomogeneous case , further numerical simulations will prove the existence of a strong superradiant peaking in the leakage current of single qd in the spin - blockade regime .",
    "this section gives an in - depth description of the hamiltonian under study , formally introduced in eqn .. the system we consider consists of a single electrically - defined qd in a transport setting as schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] . due to strong confinement",
    "only a single orbital level is relevant .",
    "moreover , the qd is assumed to be in the strong coulomb - blockade regime so that at maximum one electron resides inside the qd .",
    "therefore , the effective hilbert - space of the qd electron is @xmath34 where the lowest energy states for an additional electron in the qd with spin @xmath35 are split by an external magnetic field .",

    "electron transport through the qd is induced by attaching the qd to two electron leads ( labeled as @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) which are in thermal equilibrium at chemical potentials @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",

    "the operators @xmath47 fulfill the usual fermi commutation relations : @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the effect of the coulomb interaction in the leads can be taken into account by renormalized effective quasi - particle masses .",
    "a positive source - drain voltage @xmath0 leads to a dominant tunneling of electrons from left to right .",

    "the cooperative effects are based on the the collective hyperfine interaction of the electronic spin of the qd with @xmath6 initially polarized nuclear spins in the host environment of the qd @xcite .",

    ", we also restrict our analysis to one nuclear species only .",
    "these simplifications will be addressed in more detail in sec .",

    "resonant processes such as @xmath307 can lead to dephasing similar to the inhomogenous knight shift .",
    "this competes with the phasing necessary for the observation of sr as expressed by the first term in eqn .. the sr process is the weakest at the very beginning of the evolution where we estimate its strength as @xmath308 .",
    "an upper bound for the dipole - dipole interaction in gaas has been given in ref .",

    "therefore , the nuclear dipole - dipole interaction can safely be neglected for @xmath310 . in particular , its effect should be further reduced for highly polarized ensembles . moreover , as argued above due to the presence of the mpm - term in eqn . and demonstrated by our simulations , the observation of sr is even robust against dephasing caused by the much stronger knight field .",
    "our transport setting is tuned into the sequential tunneling regime and therefore we have disregarded cotunneling processes which are fourth order in @xmath4 . in principle , cotunneling processes could lift the spin - blockade and add an extra contribution to the leakage current that is independent of the hf dynamics .",

    "still , if one is to explore the regime where cotunneling can not be neglected , phenomenological dissipative terms  effectively describing the corresponding spin - flip and pure dephasing mechanisms for inelastic and elastic processes respectively  should be added to eqn ..",
    "in summary , we have developed a master equation based theoretical framework for nuclear spin assisted transport through a qd . due to the collective nature of the hf interaction",
    ", it incorporates intriguing many - body effects as well as feedback mechanisms between the electron spin and nuclear spin dynamics . as a prominent application",
    ", we have shown that the current through a single electrically defined qd in the spin - blockade regime naturally exhibits superradiant behavior .",
    "this effect stems from the collective hyperfine interaction between the qd electron and the nuclear spin ensemble in the qd .",
    "its most striking feature is a lifting of the spin - blockade and a sudden peak in the leakage current .",
    "the experimental observation of this effect would provide clear evidence of coherent hf dynamics of nuclear spin ensembles in qds .",
    "finally , we highlight possible directions of research going beyond our present work : apart from electronic superradiance , the setup proposed here is inherently well suited for other experimental applications like dynamic polarization of nuclear spins ( dnp ) : in analogy to optical pumping , eqn .",
    "electronic _ pumping of the nuclear spins .",
    "its steady states are eigenstates of @xmath306 , which lie in the kernel of the collective jump - operator @xmath321 . in particular , for a completely inhomogeneous system the only steady state is the fully polarized one , the ideal initial state required for the observation of sr effects . when starting from a completely unpolarized nuclear state , the uni - directionality of eqn . ",
    "electrons with one spin orientation exchange excitations with the nuclear spins , while electrons of opposite spin primarily do not  implies that the rather warm electronic reservoir can still extract entropy out of the nuclear system .",
    "more generally , the transport setting studied here possibly opens up the route towards the ( feedback - based ) electronic preparation of particular nuclear states in single qds .",
    "this is in line with similar ideas previously developed in double qd settings , see e.g. refs.@xcite .    in this work we have specialized on a single qd",
    "however , our theory could be extended to a double qd ( dqd ) setting which is likely to offer even more possibilities .",
    "dqds are routinely operated in the pauli - blockade regime where despite the presence of an applied source - drain voltage the current through the device is blocked whenever the electron tunneling into the dqd has the same spin orientation as the one already present .",
    "the dqd parameters and the external magnetic field can be tuned such that the role of the states @xmath322 , in our model is played by a pair of singlet and triplet states , while all other states are off - resonant . then , along the lines of our study , non - linearities appear due to dependencies between the electronic and nuclear subsystems and collective effects enter via the hf - mediated lifting of the spin - blockade .    while we have focused on the markovian regime and the precise conditions for the validity thereof , eqn .",
    "offers a starting point for studies of non - markovian effects in the proposed transport setting .",
    "all terms appearing in the memory kernel of eqn .",
    "are quadratic in the fermionic creation and annihilation operators allowing for an efficient numerical simulation , without having to explicitly invoke the flatness of the spectral density of the leads .",
    "this should then shed light on possibly abrupt changes in the qd transport properties due to feedback mechanism between the nuclear spin ensemble and the electron spin .",
    "lastly , our work also opens the door towards studies of dissipative phase transitions in the transport setting : when combined with driving , the sr dynamics can lead to a variety of strong - correlation effects , non - equilibrium and dissipative phase transitions @xcite , which could now be studied in a mesoscopic solid state system , complementing other approaches to dissipative phase transitions in qds @xcite .",

    "<S> this general tool is then used to study the leakage current through a single qd in a transport setting . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , for an initially polarized nuclear system , the proposed setup leads to a strong current peak , in close analogy with superradiant emission of photons from atomic ensembles . </S>",
    "<S> this effect could be observed with realistic experimental parameters and would provide clear evidence of coherent hf dynamics of nuclear spin ensembles in qds . </S>"
