    "vibrational energy relaxation ( ver ) is of fundamental importance for many chemical reactions in solution @xcite .",
    "ver studies in molecules like @xmath0 , and @xmath1 in various solvents by means of pulsed laser techniques cover a range of relaxation times from picoseconds to seconds @xcite .",
    "a detailed theoretical description is often complicated by the fact that various energy relaxation processes contribute .",
    "while in the high frequency regime a quantum mechanical treatment , e.  g. , on the basis of the isolated binary collision model is natural , the low frequency regime has for the most part been treated in terms of classical theories such as the landau - teller model , the generalized langevin equation , or by molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "these approaches are justified for high temperatures and heavier molecules .",
    "however , in some of the above mentioned molecules in solution as well as for adsorbates on surfaces , molecules in cryogenic matrices , or molecular crystals , purely classical theories are not sufficient and quantum effects can not be disregarded .",
    "this is also due to the fact that experiments have to be performed at low temperatures where only few vibrational levels are occupied .",
    "for these systems , ver was mostly treated on the basis of fermi s golden rule and the quantum master equation @xcite .",
    "one of the questions arising in this context is the connection between the quantum mechanical theory of ver and classical energy relaxation . to address this problem ,",
    "we give here a semiclassical analysis of the quantum master equation . the zwanzig energy diffusion equation @xcite",
    "is recovered in the classical limit and the dominant quantum corrections are determined explicitly .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the microscopic model which is a nonlinear oscillator coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "this model is known to lead in the classical limit to the generalized langevin equation .",
    "molecular dynamics simulation suggest that the model can also be used for rather complicated relaxation processes , such as e.g. , a binary molecule in a lennard - jones fluid , if the parameters of the harmonic oscillator bath are chosen appropriately @xcite .",
    "we briefly discuss the classical limit of the model , and its weak - coupling limit , which leads to the zwanzig energy diffusion equation .",
    "further , the fully quantum mechanical treatment of ver on the basis of a master equation is given .",
    "section iii is devoted to the semiclassical expansion of the master equation .",
    "this requires , apart from known expansions of wave functions and energy levels , explicit results on semiclassical dipole matrix elements .",
    "on the basis of these results we then show that the master equation reduces to the classical energy diffusion equation in the limit @xmath2 , and determine the leading quantum corrections .",
    "section iv contains explicit results for the cases of the harmonic and morse potentials , and in section v we present our conclusions .",
    "vibrational motion of molecules can be modeled as the motion of a particle in an anharmonic potential well @xmath3 . to account for dissipation we couple the particle to a bath of harmonic oscillators @xcite .",
    "of course , the harmonic oscillator bath is a crude simplification of the real interaction of molecular vibrations with the solvent .",
    "however , inasmuch as the back - action of the solvent can be treated within linear response theory , the bath can be modeled in terms of effective bath oscillators .",
    "in fact , this simple model describes the classical dynamics of a binary molecule in a lennard - jones fluid quite accurately @xcite . for the problem of energy relaxation",
    "we expect the harmonic oscillator bath to be a reasonable starting point . with these premises",
    ", the hamiltonian @xmath4 is composed of the oscillator part @xmath5 the bath hamiltonian @xmath6 and an interaction part @xmath7 it is well known @xcite that the associated classical equation of motion is the generalized langevin equation @xmath8 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the argument , and @xmath9 is the damping kernel .",
    "finally , @xmath10 is a stochastic force having the properties @xmath11 and @xmath12 we will be interested in the motion at weak damping .",
    "when @xmath13 is the frequency of small undamped oscillations about the minimum of the potential well , a typical damping strength is given by @xmath14 further , we may introduce a typical memory delay time @xmath15 the region of damping parameters examined in this article is then characterized by @xmath16    let us briefly recall the _ classical treatment _ of this weak damping limit . under",
    "the conditions stated , the unperturbed energy @xmath17 of the particle will be an almost conserved quantity , and it is advantageous to rewrite the classical langevin equation in terms of energy and phase variables .",
    "the unperturbed trajectory @xmath18 of energy @xmath19 satisfying @xmath20 may be written as a fourier series @xmath21 where @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the oscillation period of a trajectory of energy @xmath19 in the potential well .",
    "the phase will be chosen such that for @xmath24 the trajectory is at a turning point .",
    "then the fourier coefficients are real and satisfy @xmath25 now , relation ( [ fourier ] ) and @xmath26 define a mapping from the variables @xmath27 to the variables @xmath28 . by means of this transformation",
    ", the langevin equation may be written in terms of energy and phase @xcite .",
    "these transformed equations may be solved perturbatively to second order in the coupling to the bath . within the time window @xmath29",
    "the solution can be matched with the solution of a fokker - planck equation for the energy and phase distribution function @xcite .",
    "the structure of the resulting fokker - planck process allows one to average over the phase variable yielding the one - dimensional fokker - planck equation @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the energy relaxation coefficient . here",

    "in addition , for the quantum system a further frequency scale set by the lowest matsubara frequency @xmath45 becomes relevant .",
