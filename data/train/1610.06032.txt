    "this work generalizes the results of reference @xcite to the cosmological framework in which a robertson - walker ( r - w ) geometry dominates the large scale structure of the spacetime .",
    "therefore , we present expressions for the lens optical scalars directly in terms of the energy - momentum tensor distribution immersed in a cosmological scenario .",
    "we make no a priori assumptions on the nature of the lens , so that our equations show the contribution from components of the matter distribution that have been neglected previously .",
    "we also present other new results including the relation between the intensity magnifications with the standard angular magnification .    in our previous work@xcite on gravitational lenses ,",
    "we have presented new general expressions for the bending angle and the optical scalars for a congruence of null geodesics in the regime of weak gravitational fields over a flat background .",
    "these formulas have the advantage of being explicitly gauge invariant and allow us to include more general forms of matter distributions than those discussed in most standard references on the subject@xcite .",
    "systems involving gravitational lens effects appear naturally in the cosmological context .",
    "and although the standard works on gravitational lens , based on a flat background , are useful ; new subtle issues arise when the gravitational lens is studied in the cosmological framework .",
    "we improve on the tools shown in @xcite , and so provide with new expressions that are useful for the study of the matter content in cosmological astrophysical systems .",
    "indeed , the expressions presented below are a tool to study in more detail the missing mass problem ; since we present equations describing gravitational lensing that describe more general situations ; enabling the characterization of more general energy momentum tensors , in contrast to the usual newtonian description of the dark matter phenomena .",
    "in particular we do not neglect spacelike components of the energy momentum tensor .",
    "this is not a minor aspect in the study of gravitational lenses , since the general understanding is that the most abundant component in large gravitational systems such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies , is unseeing matter and/or energy whose nature is completely unknown . so that new tools available for the theoretical studies are always welcome .",
    "our work is a contribution in this direction .",
    "we have seen in the past that there is some suggestive evidence that the inclusion of the up to now neglected spacelike components of the energy momentum tensor turns out to be important for the study of dark matter phenomena as it was shown in @xcite where a simplified model with this features allows for excellent description of the matter content in clusters of galaxies , and for the velocity rotation curves in galaxies .",
    "more specifically , in this work we broaden the range of validity of previous results and discussions to the case in which the background is within the family of robertson - walker geometries , proceeding in a systematic way without introducing early assumptions of newtonian character and further preconditions related to the observational configuration such as the well known approximation of thin lenses . here , instead we have chosen to consider such approximations after a general treatment of the exact equations governing the distortion of the images in the cosmological background . in this way we found new expressions for the optical scalars of the gravitational lens which are expressed in term of the source of curvature producing the lens .",
    "the new improvements that we introduce require subtle but significant modifications in the treatment of the subject , that will be described along the article .",
    "an interesting new result is for example the presence of a redshift factor correcting the widely used expressions of thin lenses as appears in eq .",

    "( 16 ) of reference @xcite ( see section [ sec : thin - lenses ] ) .",
    "our findings are relevant to works concerning tests of fundamental geometrical relations in observational cosmology which are based on the use of gravitational lensing ; see for example @xcite .    in section [ sec : grav - lens ]",
    "we spent some time reviewing the basic concepts , also with the intention to set the notation and language used in the rest of this paper . in section [ sec : frw ] we discuss null geodesics in r - w geometry and coordinates adapted to the observations .",
    "section [ sec : distances ] contains a discussion of the different notions of distance appearing in cosmological studies together with the relation among them .",
    "next , in section [ sec : rw - lens ] we present the expression for the cosmological convergence , valid for arbitrary angular aperture and without approximations , when the r - w geometry is considered as a gravitational lens .",
    "the appearance of an additional lens over the r - w background is discussed in section [ sec : addit - lens ] ; in which our generalized expression are presented . in this section",
    "the presentation is mainly focused with compact lenses of small extension in comparison with the cosmological dimension traversed by the photons however the treatment also admits a straightforward extension to higher accuracy approximations as considered for example in @xcite . section [ sec : axial - symmetry ] deals with the axially symmetric case . in section [ sec : thin - lenses ] we present the usual approximation of thin lenses ; while in section [ sec : esferica - lenses ] the equations for a static spherically symmetric lens are written in its most general form .",
    "final comments are included in section [ sec : final - comments ] . in order not to crowd the main text with unnecessary equations we include in a pair of appendices standard equations which describe the geometrical structure discussed .",
    "the first thing to do is to agree in the language one would use to describe the phenomenology of gravitational lens effects .",
    "the basic idea one has in mind is depicted in figure [ f : fig0 ] ; where it is sketched the situation of an observer , at the bottom of the figure , receiving light from a source at the furthest surface , which is affected by a gravitational lens , along the path of the rays .     denote sources , the letter @xmath3 denotes lens and the observer is assumed to be situated at the apex of the rays.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in the discussion of the gravitational lens effects coming from an homogeneous cosmological spacetime , one would not have a lens at a particular distance , since the whole spacetime acts as a lens ; however we will retain the basic notions for the observed angle @xmath4 and _ would observe _ angle @xmath5 ; where the word ` would ' refers to what the astrophysicist would expect , if there where no gravitational lens effect , and therefore no curvature .    in any case , one can use the standard definitions of convergence and shear , that comes from the relation of these angles .    given a related pair of directions , represented by angles @xmath6",
    ", one can consider a small departure from them , whose difference will be related by a linear relation . in the sphere of directions , they can be expressed as : @xmath7 where the matrix @xmath8 is in turn expressed by @xmath9 where the optical scalars @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are known as convergence @xmath10 and shear components @xmath13 , and have the information of distortion of the image of the source due to the lens effects .",
    "in fact the shear is normally represented by the complex quantity @xmath14 .",
    "it should be emphasized that since the definition of @xmath15 and @xmath16 refer to two different geometries , one must say at what distance is the source in both cases .",
    "the calculations of the gravitational lens effects are carried out using as fundamental variable the affine distance @xmath17 from the point of observation@xcite , and with respect to the four velocity of the observer .",
    "this point is also related to the notion of angular diameter distance , that we will discuss again below for the case of homogeneous spacetimes ; but here we will only use the notion that a rod of length @xmath18 which is observed to subtend an angle @xmath19 defines the angular diameter distance @xmath20 by : @xmath21 for each spacetime one has one notion of observed angular diameter distance . in the above equation",
    ", one assumes the observation of some object of size @xmath18 , so that one would have @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the flat metric and @xmath25 the real physical metric . in minkowski spacetime",
    "the angular diameter distance coincides with the affine distance , namely : @xmath26 . in a general spacetime , with metric @xmath25 ,",
    "one has the source at the affine distance @xmath27 ; therefore , in order to make the comparison in equation ( [ eq : standarlensequation ] ) one takes @xmath28 .",
    "here we provide with a brief summary of the essentials equations needed to the treatment of gravitational lensing .",
    "let @xmath29 be an scalar function such that the level sets @xmath30constant denote a family of null hypersurfaces ; then we define the vector field @xmath31 from the one - form @xmath32 which satisfies @xmath33 and @xmath34 therefore , there is a natural radial affine function @xmath35 , given by @xmath36 let us note that by construction this congruence is twist free",
    ".    in our construction @xmath30constant will characterize our past null cone .",
    "the way in which the null function @xmath29 grows to the future is normalized by the condition @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the observer s 4-velocity .",
    "this condition implies that we are choosing @xmath39 to be future pointing ; and it also fixes the scale of the affine parametrization , but it still remains a freedom associated to the choice of origin ; or equivalently the freedom to make a translation in the value of @xmath35 , for each null direction in the congruence",
    ". we will fix below this freedom by taking the natural choice which correspond to set @xmath40 at the apex of the cone .    in",
    "what follows it will be useful to refer the discussion to a null tetrad adapted to the past null cone of the observer",
    ". the first null vector in our tetrad will be @xmath39 in the way we have just defined .",
    "the other vectors are two spacelike vector fields @xmath41 and @xmath42 tangents to the surfaces @xmath43constant and @xmath30constant , and satisfying @xmath44 and the last null vector will be denoted as @xmath45 which is chosen orthogonal to @xmath41 and @xmath42 and satisfying @xmath46    .,scaledwidth=40.0% ]      the main object for the quantification of the optical distortions is the deviation vector @xmath47 which describes the behaviour of the congruence by computing the local separation of different geodesics . by definition",
    "it satisfies the condition @xmath48 that is , the lie derivative along @xmath39 vanishes .",
    "the equation that provides us with the information about the distortion of images is the _ geodesic deviation equation _ for the deviation vector @xmath47 along the congruence with tangent @xmath39 ; namely @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the riemann tensor .",
    "this equation is obtained by taking a second covariant derivative to the deviation vector .",
    "the deviation vector can be expressed as @xmath51 and using the vector @xmath52 build up from the components @xmath53 ; @xmath54 equation ( [ eq : der lie de varsigma ] ) can be written in the following form as @xmath55 where the matrix @xmath56 is @xmath57 and @xmath58 , @xmath59 are the spin coefficients in the ghp@xcite notation which correspond respectively to the expansion and the shear of the congruence under study .",
    "we would like to notice that the symbol for the spin coefficient @xmath58 should not be confused with the symbol @xmath60 that we will later use for denoting energy density .",
    "it can be seen that the matrix @xmath56 satisfies @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the matrix @xmath63 whose elements are the curvature components : @xmath64 and @xmath65 denoting with @xmath66 the ricci tensor and @xmath67 the weyl tensor .",
    "the second order differential equation coming from the geodesic deviation equation is ; using this notation : @xmath68 working with this equation has the advantage that it is explicitly given in terms of the curvature components .",
    "as it is well known r - w metrics are geometries which posses spatially homogeneous and isotropic symmetry@xcite and play a fundamental role in our standard description of the universe at its largest scales .",
    "the line element of such geometries can be cast in the following form @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the so - called _ cosmological time _",
    ", i.e. the proper time associated to the family of fundamental observers which perceives isotropy and @xmath71 is the line element for the spacelike surfaces orthogonal to the preferred observers . as a consequence of the symmetries @xmath71 must to be one of the three possible 3-riemaniann metrics of constant curvature .",
    "we distinguish them by the subindex @xmath72 which takes the values @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 corresponding respectively to a @xmath76sphere , a @xmath76plane and a @xmath76hyperboloid .",
    "three equivalent and useful ways of write @xmath71 are : @xmath77 where in equation ( [ eq : dl - standard ] ) @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 the two - dimensional line element @xmath80 is the common metric of the unit @xmath81sphere , which is often found in one of the two following forms @xmath82 where @xmath83 are usual angular coordinates and @xmath84 complex stereographic coordinates on the complex plane .",
    "regarding to the information inferred from observations in our past light cone one realizes that the relevant geometrical quantities for the description of observations are the null rays reaching the observer and the angular deviations of such rays .",
    "all observable quantities are constructed from them .",
    "then , it is necessary to have at hand an adequate description in term of the past light cone of the observers .",
    "associated to the observer one has its proper time @xmath85 ; which for co - moving observers coincides with the standard coordinate time @xmath70 .",
    "then , the @xmath86velocity @xmath38 of the observer , can be expressed as @xmath87    in the following we will introduce a coordinate system which is well adapted to the discussion that follows .",
    "we begin by labeling each past light cone with a null function @xmath29 which takes constant values on the cones . in particular",
    ", this means that the value of @xmath29 can be set by the proper time @xmath85 ; an we choose the relation @xmath88 at the origin ; but one can also use another specification for @xmath29 that is not based on the synchronization of the null function with the proper time of the observer .",
    "in fact , we will use below a definition based on the conformal structure of the metric .",
    "but in any case , the physically relevant null geodesic congruence associated to the observer , can be expressed in terms of this null function by ( [ eq : ell_du ] ) .",
    "let us note also that this setup can be generalized for an arbitrary world line @xmath89 with @xmath86velocity @xmath90 in terms of a general proper time @xmath91 .",
    "let us introduce another null function which is very useful for the calculations .",
    "we define @xmath93 from @xmath94 where we have used tilde in order to differentiate it from the natural choice presented before .",
    "this choice result more appropriated to the study of the asymptotic behaviour of the geometry @xcite but it is also helpful in many computation in comparison with the choice @xmath95 .    the next step is to complete the coordinate system putting coordinates on each past light cone . in this process also a null tetrad @xmath96 associated to this construction can be selected .",
    "first let us consider the vector @xmath97 determined by the one - form @xmath98 which is geodesic and affinely parametrized , since @xmath93 is null .",
    "now , let @xmath99 be the affine parameter along the cone associated to @xmath97 , starting from the observer .",
    "this will be our second coordinate .",
    "then , a pair of null complex vectors @xmath100 and @xmath101 can be chosen to be tangent to the surfaces @xmath102constant and @xmath103constant and satisfying @xmath104    to complete our coordinate system we label the generators of the null cone by the stereographic coordinates @xmath105 .",
    "finally , we also complete our tetrad with a null vector @xmath106 chosen such that @xmath107    explicitly , in term of the usual coordinates @xmath108 , the vector field @xmath97 is expressed as : @xmath109 while for the other tetrad vectors we have : @xmath110.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the line element ( [ eq : line - element ] ) with the choice ( [ eq : dl - standard ] ) can be expressed in terms of the new coordinate system @xmath111 .",
    "we will do this with an intermediate step ; using eq .",
    "( [ eq : du ] ) one can express the geometry in terms of the coordinate system @xmath112 to find : @xmath113 where here it is important to note that the vector @xmath114 is expressed as @xmath115 since also @xmath116 , we also have the relation @xmath117 so we take @xmath118    this is the relation that we need to cast the line element in terms of the coordinates @xmath111 since now we can differentiate to obtain @xmath119 where we use the notation @xmath120 to mean @xmath121 where it should be noted that @xmath122 need not be the present time ; but the coordinate @xmath70 evaluated at the origin .",
    "then , one arrives to the desired expression for the metric : @xmath123    for completeness we include here the relations among the differential of the old coordinate system in terms of the latest one ; they are given as follows : @xmath124      in this case we consider the choice @xmath95 which will be presented in similar way to the discussion of the previous section .",
    "this has the advantage to help the reading and at the same time it allows to arrive to the main expression in a simple way using the definitions above presented .",
    "then , let us find the relation between both functions by noting that @xmath125 along the world line of a preferred observer . since @xmath29 is normalized with @xmath70 at the origin , from equation ( [ eq : du ] ) one has @xmath126 which leads us to define the first null vector @xmath127 as @xmath128 this gives us a congruence of future directed null geodesics , affinely parametrized that reach the observer . the affine parameter in this case",
    "will be denoted by @xmath35 and constitute our second coordinate .",
    "stereographic coordinates label the generators of the congruence as before .",

    "the metric in the advanced coordinates @xmath131 writes as @xmath132    the affine parameter @xmath35 associated to @xmath133 and the differential @xmath134 are found to be @xmath135 and @xmath136 where we introduce here the _",
    "hubble function _ on the observer world line @xmath137    one can then transform to a coordinate system in which the radial coordinate is @xmath35 instead of @xmath138 ; so that now @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "note that now @xmath141 .",
    "gathering together this expressions one arrives to the metric in coordinates @xmath142 : @xmath143      in the r - w geometries , the behaviour of the deviation vector , is easily found by considering the ordinary linear differential equation ( [ eq : der lie de varsigma ] ) on the past null cone : @xmath144    let us note here that we can use @xmath39 or @xmath145 as vector field tangent to the congruence since the description is independent of the affine parametrization .    in the coordinates @xmath146 of section [ subsec : inertial - u ]",
    "the convergence @xmath58 takes the simple and transparent expression : @xmath147 this means that the deviation vector is given by : @xmath148 where the integration constant constant @xmath149 has the meaning of the angle measured by the fundamental observer between two neighbour null geodesic .",
    "since this factor will appear frequently we define @xmath150 which will be identified below to the angular diameter distance .",
    "since the notion of distance plays a central role in the discussion of gravitational lenses , and it is central to all the discussion in this paper , it is convenient that we review here the usual notions of distance that appear in the cosmological framework .",
    "the observer @xmath151 defines the redshift associated with the event @xmath152 by the expression @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the tangent vector to a null geodesic connecting the two events and @xmath38 denotes either the @xmath86velocities of the source @xmath152 or that of the observer .",
    "although the redshift is an indication of different proper times measures it is also used as an indication of distance in r - w spacetimes .",
    "when the source and the observer are both fundamental observers of a r - w spacetime , one has @xmath155 in other words , the redshift can be used as a notion of distance if one has at hand a given family of cosmological objects with known motion .",
    "given an observer with 4-velocity @xmath38 , there is a natural notion of distance @xmath17 defined on any past directed null geodesic on any spacetime ; which is identified with the affine parameter so chosen that normalization ( [ eq : vconele ] ) holds , and is zero at the observer position . in the case of a r - w spacetime , this distance is related to the coordinate and affine parameter @xmath35 , by @xmath156 to differentiate from other definitions we will call this the _ geometric distance _ or _ normalized affine distance_. by definition it increases monotonically along every past directed null geodesic from the observer .",
    "a fundamental concept in the study of gravitational lenses is the comparison of an image that is observed , with the unaffected image , for which gravitational effects can be completely neglected .",
    "but , then , it is crucial to compare the images in both situations when the source is at the ` same ' distance .",
    "it is here that the definition of the distance that one should use , becomes important , and we claim that the appropriate notion is the one given by the definition of normalized affine distance , or geometric distance .",
    "this is the concept that is always well behaved ( it increases monotonically as the objects are further away ) and it can be applied to any situation and spacetime ( with or without symmetries ) , and that we use as the fundamental notion of distance in this work .",
    "the so called ` angular diameter distance ' , @xmath20 , is defined as @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the projected size of the object , perpendicular to the line of sight , at the place of the emitter , and @xmath159 is the subtended angle measured in the sky by the observer .",
    "this definition is closely related to the _ area distance _ ; which is defined from : @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the projected area of the object , perpendicular to the line of sight , at the place of the emitter , @xmath162 and @xmath163 are the angular diameter distances along the principal directions of the area@xcite , and @xmath164 is the solid angle seeing by the observer ; and the area distance @xmath165 is defined by @xmath166 so that now one can write @xmath167    let us note that this measure of distance does not depend on the peculiar velocity of the emitter , it depends only on the @xmath86velocity of the observer@xcite .",
    "it is probably important to emphasize that in the discussion on r - w spacetimes the area distance coincides with the angular diameter distance ; for this reason in the remainder of the paper will just use @xmath168 to denote both distances , in the case of r - w spacetimes .    for fundamental observers in r - w geometries",
    "this notion of distance is explicitly given by those presented in equation ( [ eq : d - a - fisrt - defin ] ) : @xmath169 from its definition , one notes that the _ area distance _ is related to the expansion of a thin bundle of null geodesics leaving the observer and reaching the source ; in fact , in a r - w spacetime one can see this fact explicitly by looking at equation ( [ eq : rho - area - rw ] ) . in this particular case one",
    "has @xmath170 and the second order differential equation @xmath171 it can be seen that in general @xmath58 has a value @xmath172 for which it vanishes and then change its sign . then , the value of @xmath20 reaches an stationary value at @xmath172 ; which is a maximum , since @xmath173 is positive when the usual energy conditions are considered to hold .",
    "for this reason this notion of distance is not really a distance ; since in particular it tends to zero when the source is at the farthest distance , i.e. at the beginning of the universe ; where @xmath174 .",
    "but in any case it is a useful concept that can be employed to describe the behaviour of gravitational lenses .",
    "let us also note that there is a notion of _ future angular diameter distance _ @xmath175 , which is related to the angular diameter distance calculated by the emitter to reach an object of projected size @xmath176 at the place of observer , perpendicular to the direction of the path of a photon .",
    "more concretely , one defines @xmath175 by the relation @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the angle measured by a fiducial observer at the source with the same @xmath86velocity as the source .",
    "we can also generalize to the notion of _ future area distance _ ; which is defined from : @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the projected area of the object at the place of the observer , and @xmath181 is the solid angle generated at the source position , @xmath182 and @xmath183 are the future angular diameter distances along the principal directions of the area ; and the future area distance @xmath184 is defined by @xmath185    also in the case of a r - w geometry the future area distance coincides with the future angular diameter distance and so one can use @xmath186 for both notions .",
    "we will discuss in section [ subsec : reciprocity - theorem ] the existing relation between the future area distance @xmath175 and the area distance @xmath20 .",
    "for the moment , we will mention that in the most general case of an _ unresolved _ non - isotropic radiating source at redshift @xmath187 which emits with a luminosity @xmath188 in the direction @xmath189 , pointing out into the observer direction , one predicts that the flux @xmath190 measured by the observer is given by @xmath191 where the left hand side is the expression for the energy measured by the observer per unit time in the direction of the source @xmath192 , collected in the surface element @xmath180 , and the right hand side is the expression for the energy emitted by the source per unit ( local)time in the direction of the observer , in the solid angle @xmath181 , with the corresponding redshift factor that takes into account the difference in local proper times , and the local energy measures . to clarify the notation ,",
    "let us remark that if we call @xmath193 the total luminosity , and if the source where radiating isotropically , then one would have @xmath194 .",
    "let us note that another way to write ( [ eq : dadomega ] ) is : @xmath195 so that one finally has @xmath196 where we are emphasizing that the flux depends on the distance @xmath17 and on the state of motion of the source , characterized by the redshift factor of expression ( [ eq : redshift ] ) .",
    "let us note that ( [ eq : flux - future - ang - distance ] ) is valid in a general spacetime and that what we call future angular diameter distance is what other authors call ` corrected luminosity distance'@xcite : but we prefer our wording because it is more natural for the discussion of the _ reciprocity theorem _ that we present below .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the definition of area distance @xmath165 and future area distance @xmath184 have been presented for a general spacetime . for the general case",
    "there is a purely geometric result due to etherington@xcite which establishes that@xcite : @xmath197 which is known as the _",
    "etherington theorem_. an interesting corollary of this result is derived from ( [ eq : dadarea - domega ] ) and ( [ eq : dadomega-2 ] ) , since one can prove the relation between the area distances , namely @xmath198    this is a fundamental relation between the future area distance @xmath199 and the ( observed ) area distance @xmath165 , also known as the _ reciprocity relation _ , which is only deduced from considerations of thin bundles connecting the source and the observer .    also , relation ( [ eq : reciprocityth ] ) is the main tool to prove the distance - duality relation , that we recall next .",
    "let us return to the relation between the observed flux and the total luminosity of an unresolved emitter , shown in equation ( [ eq : flux - future - ang - distance ] ) .",
    "this relation gives rise to the notion of _ luminosity distance _",
    "@xmath200 which is defined in term of @xmath190 and @xmath188 in a completely analogous way than in a flat - spacetime , namely @xmath201 from which one can see that : @xmath202    although this definition has been presented for unresolved sources ; estimates of distances from extended sources can be based on the same principle . in such cases the problem to infer distance for",
    "_ resolved _ or _ extended objects _ involves the consideration of the so called _ surface brightness_. we will discuss these topics elsewhere .",
    "the combination of equation ( [ eq : lum - dist - vs - fut - ang - dist ] ) together with the geometric relation established by the reciprocity theorem ( [ eq : reciprocityth ] ) gives as a corollary the so called _ distance - duality relation _ : @xmath203 which links the luminosity distance with the area distance .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that this relation , valid for a general spacetime , has been derived just from a couple of assumptions , namely : that photons follow geodesics and that the number of photons is conserved . since",
    ", the geodesic motion of photons is sustained by the undisputed equivalence principle , any observed deviations from the distance - duality relation would imply a non - conservation of the mean number of photon along null geodesics@xcite .",
    "it is important to remark that the basic notion of a gravitational lens is encoded in equation ( [ eq : standarlensequation ] ) , in which the departure angle @xmath15 refers to an unaffected spacetime , and therefore minkowski ; while the departure angle @xmath16 refers to the real spacetime , in this case r - w .",
    "then , when one considers this spacetime as a gravitational lens , this is not located at a particular position , it rather fills the whole spacetime .",
    "it is because of this reason that one has to be very careful with the interpretation of the optical scalars , as defined in equation ( [ eq : optical - scalars0 ] ) .",
    "we are thinking in the case of an observer within a r - w which , when estimating deviation angles , it must relate the observed angle @xmath204 with the unperturbed angle @xmath15 , when the source is at the ` same ' _ distance _ ; where as usual , the second angle refers to an observation where no gravitational effects are present .",
    "therefore it is crucial to have a clear understanding of the notion of _ distance _ , that one must use .",
    "from all the notions of distance that are employed in the literature and that we have mentioned in section [ sec : distances ] , the most fundamental one , that requires the least structure is the _ geometric distance _ @xmath17 ; since it only uses the information of the 4-velocity of the observer and the null geodesic coming from the source . in fact , it can be applied to any spacetime and any past directed null geodesic .",
    "consequently , it constitutes the natural notion of distance in such context .",
    "then , for a source of size @xmath205 at a distance @xmath17 along the past null cone this observer would expect to see , in the absence of gravitational effects , that the source is subtending an angle @xmath206 : @xmath207 however , in r - w geometries equation ( [ eq : x solution ] ) tells us that @xmath208 then , from equation ( [ eq : d - a - fisrt - defin ] ) one has the simple relation @xmath209    the relation between the observed angle @xmath210 and @xmath211 is understood as the lensing effect produced by the r - w cosmology . in the usual language of weak lensing this constitute a very peculiar lens since the whole spacetime acts as a lens which is not placed at a particular distance .",
    "furthermore , in the r - w gravitational lens there is no bending angle due to the fact that it is an homogeneous and isotropic spacetime . in spite of this ,",
    "one still has a non - trivial meaning of the optical scalars .",
    "it is important to remark this fact because it is a source of confusion .",
    "for instance , the diagram appearing in figure [ f : fig0 ] comes from the normal situation one encounters for a localized gravitational lens .",
    "however , in the case in which the whole spacetime is acting as a lens ( which is not localized ) the diagram must be understood in the conceptual way using the definitions of @xmath211 and @xmath210 as the angles measured with no lens , and with lens , respectively .",
    "another essential point that one should also note is that equations ( [ eq : chideteta ] ) and ( [ eq : dbetadalambdadteta ] ) are exact equations valid also for large values of @xmath210 .",
    "this means that one can regard the r - w lens in a non - perturbative way @xcite .",
    "we next present the standard optical scalar and the different magnifications that appear in astrophysical discussions .",
    "equation ( [ eq : dbetadalambdadteta ] ) is telling us that no cosmic shear is present , and that the _ cosmological convergence _",
    "@xmath212 can be deduced from @xmath213 so that one has @xmath214    in general , @xmath215 holds for all values of @xmath17 and for close objects one has that @xmath216 .",
    "in fact , this is the common situation that one finds in the discussion of weak gravitational lenses in which the magnitudes of the optical scalars are always much smaller than the unit value and eq .",
    "( [ eq : standarlensequation ] ) represents an approximation for small departures from chosen angular directions .",
    "however as indicated above , in the r - w geometry the cosmic convergence is exactly given by ( [ eq : kappadedaylambda ] ) , which goes to the unit value as one approaches the initial cosmic singularity .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath212 close to the observer can be investigated taking an expansion of @xmath20 in terms of @xmath17 ; we found : @xmath217 where @xmath218      in a general spacetime the _ magnification _",
    "@xmath2 is defined as the ratio between the solid angles subtended by the `` lensed '' and the `` unlensed '' image .",
    "when using the principal directions of the lensed image , one has the relations @xmath219 and @xmath220 from which one can also deduce that @xmath221 where @xmath222 is the module of the shear .    for most astrophysical situations one has @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "if we multiply , let us say , ( [ eq : betacosmic ] ) by @xmath17 we obtain @xmath225 and similarly with the + case .",
    "then it is deduced that one can also express @xmath226 since the area distance in flat spacetime is just @xmath17 .",
    "this expression , valid for a general spacetime , coincides with the definition found in eq .",
    "( 42 ) of the reference @xcite .    for the _ cosmic magnification _",
    "@xmath227 , one then has @xmath228    let us notice that @xmath227 diverges as the source is considered close to the initial singularity ; which in turns indicates that @xmath212 approaches the unit value , and therefore it can not be assumed to be small at large distances .",
    "in this subsection we present the natural physical intensity magnification , that we will denote with @xmath0 , and that we just call _ intensity magnification _ ; but also it is convenient to introduce the astrophysical motivated _ cosmic intensity magnification _ , that we will denote with @xmath229 . the behavior of these intensity magnifications will be discussed below after the introduction of a couple of cosmic examples .",
    "let us denote again with @xmath230 the observed flux of an unresolved object at distance @xmath17 and relative motion determined by the redshift @xmath187 , in a general spacetime .",
    "we will use @xmath231 to denote the flux that one expects to collect from the same object at the same distance @xmath17 in minkowski spacetime with the same relative motion .",
    "then , we define the intensity magnification @xmath0 by the quotient of these two fluxes , namely : @xmath232 where , taking into account equation ( [ eq : flux - future - ang - distance ] ) , one can see that actually @xmath233 turns out to depend only on the distance @xmath17 , and we use the subindex 0 to denote quantities in minkowski spacetime .",
    "it is probably worthwhile to remark that we are using here the same philosophy that one applies to the basic notion of gravitational lens in equation ( [ eq : standarlensequation ] ) , where one compares angles in the sphere of directions between the lensed situation and the unlensed one ( flat case ) .",
    "it is crucial here to recall the reciprocity theorem , since it allows us to prove the following theorem , valid for a general spacetime :    [ teo : rema ]    the intensity magnification coincides with the ( standard angular ) magnification ; namely : @xmath234    proof : we have seen above that a corollary of the etherington theorem , presented in [ subsec : reciprocity - theorem ] , is the reciprocity relation ( [ eq : reciprocityth ] ) ; so that in the expression for the intensity magnification above one can replace the future area distances by the observed area distances , and express @xmath235 where , we have used equation ( [ eq : mu ] ) .    the previous definition and",
    "the theorem apply to a general spacetime ; when considering this intensity magnification in the cosmological scenario , one can express : @xmath236    a very important point to remark is that astrophysicists normally think in the relation of the fluxes as a function of the observed redshift ; so that from the observational point of view , it might become useful also to define @xmath237 where more specifically in this case one uses the flat milne cosmological model , in order to have a relation @xmath238 .    here",
    "it should be remarked that although the definition of this intensity magnification also involves the quotient of the same fluxes ; the definition ( [ eq : mag_lambda ] ) gives a different function because it involves a different parametrization of the scalars .",
    "for this same reason , the right hand side of ( [ eq : mag_z ] ) does not coincide with the magnification @xmath227 of ( [ eq : mu - cosm ] ) .",
    "in particular , since in the flat spacetime case we need a relation between the distance @xmath17 and the redshift @xmath187 , one makes use of the cosmological model given by the flat milne universe , that is recalled in the next subsection .    the reason we introduce the intensity magnification @xmath239 is because it is directly related to observations ; since astrophysicists measure relative apparent magnitudes , as given by@xcite @xmath240 the collecting apparatus normally does not receive all the photons but those on a limited band ; we assume here for the sake of simplicity in the discussion that all photons are collected ; but one can generalize these concepts to the realistic situation .    to obtain intrinsic information , one can also use the so called _ absolute magnitude _ @xmath241 ; which is defined as the magnitude of the object if it were at the standard distance of 10 parsecs .",
    "the relation of the apparent magnitude and the absolute magnitude is given by @xmath242 where the first term in the last line corresponds to the first factor in the logarithm , the second term corresponds to the second factor in the logarithm , and we have neglected the contribution coming from the ratio @xmath243 ; since the cosmic incidence to the curvature for distances up to 10pc can be completely ignored .",
    "we have used here the notation that @xmath230 refers to the flux measured in the real ( general ) spacetime and @xmath244 refers to the flux measured in the situation of empty ( flat ) spacetime .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the left hand side of equation ( [ eq : m - m ] ) is known as _ distance modulus _ , and that it can be completely expressed in terms of the gravitational lens optical scalars , since due to theorem [ teo : rema ] one can write @xmath245 where the magnification @xmath246 can be understood in terms of ( [ eq : mu-2 ] ) or ( [ eq : mu ] ) ; which are valid for general spacetimes .",
    "let us also note that the second term in the right hand side of ( [ eq : m - m_2 ] ) has kinematical information , and has no dependence on any possible cosmological background .",
    "let us now express the relation between magnifications when the redshift is used as the single variable to denote distance , as is normally done in cosmological studies .",
    "the previous expression involving the absolute magnification is now given by : @xmath247 where again we have neglected the cosmic effects at the short distance of 10pc .",
    "one can see that in this case the expression is given in terms of the intensity magnification , @xmath229 .      as a simple illustration of the family of cosmological  r - w lenses we consider the simplest one which corresponds to the milne universe ; which is the case of an empty cosmology , which is interpreted as the limit of vanishing density of an open dust model . for these reason ,",
    "the whole milne universe , defined by the coordinates of the r - w metric , is identical from the point of view of the geometry to a portion of minkowski spacetime .",
    "this geometry is characterized by @xmath75 and @xmath248 , since we are assuming @xmath249 has units of length ; although we use units for which the universal constant @xmath250 is one . in terms of",

    "we can write all quantities of the fluids and the geometric functions , as for example @xmath260 , in terms of the so - called _ density parameters _ @xmath262(see appendix [ ap : friedman - eq ] ) and the _ critical density _",

    "the last examples allow to estimate the effect of the r - w spacetimes as a gravitational lens in a simple way . in this section",

    "in the previous section we have shown that a r - w spacetime can be thought as a weak gravitational lens . in the current section",
    "we will deal with additional lenses on the geometry .",
    "we mean by this an alteration of the completely homogeneous and isotropic cosmological background where the size of the additional lens must be much smaller that the cosmological scale , since otherwise it would change the cosmology one is discussing .",
    "this means that normally the time of flight of photons trough the additional lens would be considered small compared with the total time of flight . by time of flight",
    "we mean more precisely the lapse of the geometric affine distance .    in order to compute distortions due to the presence of inhomogeneities we will consider the equation ( [ eq . dev geo ] ) over the cosmological background together with an small perturbation in the curvature",

    "we will assume that the background metric @xmath283 is ideally obtained from cosmological observations ; for instance , cmb observations .",
    "this means that one can express the complete metric as @xmath284 without any room for possible gauge transformations .",
    "it is because of this reason that we can eventually allow for expressions in which the connection of the background appears . in particular",
    ", we can make use of the frame used in the background , since we will calculate first order effects on the quantities that comprise @xmath285 .",
    "let us note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : dev geo pert0 ] ) is an exact equation valid along the new perturbed path of the photons ; however in order to find solutions we must remember that in weak lensing computations , along compact distributions much smaller than the cosmological scales , one performs the integration along the unperturbed path of the background since linear effect are contained in this kind of inhomogeneities of the curvature . from the physical point of view , one integrates equation ( [ eq : dev geo pert0 ] ) from the position of the observer along the past null cone .",
    "therefore , although one could start with finite values of @xmath205 , we are only interested on initial conditions that have the information of the null cone , and so , our @xmath205 s start with a diverging behavior ; dictated by the observing angle . for this reason we look for solutions of the form @xmath286 where @xmath241 is a well behaved @xmath287 square matrix and @xmath149",
    "has the same meaning than before ; it is the observed angle subtended by the .",
    "this ansatz is reminiscent of the unperturbed solution ( [ eq : x solution ] ) , since one recognizes the unperturbed solution @xmath288 .",
    "it is probably interesting to point out that in the weak lensing regime , the matrix @xmath241 can be related to the optical scalars matrix @xmath289 mentioned in ( [ eq : standarlensequation ] ) ; since taking the relation @xmath290 one has @xmath291 in other words , the total gravitational lens combines the global cosmic convergence @xmath212 with the ` local ' lensing effects contained in @xmath241 .",
    "the equation satisfied by @xmath241 is found from equation ( [ eq : dev geo pert0 ] ) : @xmath292 which simplifies to @xmath293 now , using the fact that for r - w geometries one has the following important relation @xmath294 one arrives to the final equation : @xmath295      in order to proceed to the integration of equation ( [ eq : m ] ) the initial conditions must be specified .",
    "one can see that the appropriate ones for our problem are : @xmath296    using the first initial condition we obtain @xmath297 while in the next step we found @xmath298 where @xmath299 denotes the position of the emitting source .",
    "let us remember that the affine parameter @xmath35 takes negative values when it approaches to the source ; due to this fact we prefer to use the normalized affine distance @xmath17 to parametrize the geodesic . with this choice we rewrite the last equation to @xmath300    since @xmath276 is ` small ' one can use iterations to solve this integro - differential equations in orders of the curvature perturbation .",
    "one can see that the leading order is @xmath301    this is the main equation which describes the distortions at first order of isolated distributions over the cosmological background here considered .",
    "it was mentioned before that the matrix @xmath289 containing the optical scalars is given by : @xmath302 it will be used together with equation ( [ eq : m - first - order - double - intergal ] ) to obtain the optical scalars . this task is most easily done working with the real and imaginary parts of the deviation vector @xmath303 ; namely @xmath304 and the real and imaginary parts of the weyl curvature scalar , @xmath305 .",

    "then , one can write the optical scalars for the whole system of an additional lens regarded over a r - w spacetime : @xmath310    one can see that the contribution of the background is two fold ; on one hand , it is present in the intrinsic optical scalar trough the geometric distance and the area distance and , on the other hand it also appears by means of the modulating factor @xmath311 .",
    "the above expressions are the generalization for the optical scalars of a lens in the standard cosmological context .    in the simpler case of a minkowski or a milne background spacetime , where @xmath312 , one arrives at the expression already presented in @xcite ; they are : @xmath313 in which the double integral has been expressed into a single one by means of a integration by parts .",
    "the expressions presented in the last sections do not involve any assumption on the nature and geometry of the source ; in this section , instead , we discuss models with axial symmetry , in which the axis of symmetry lies along the line of sight passing through the central region of the distribution .",
    "we are interested then in the study of a photon travelling along a direction parallel to the axis of symmetry which has an impact parameter @xmath314 with respect to the centre of the distribution . for this purpose",
    "we will take an adapted coordinate system to the situation in which two mutually orthogonal directions @xmath315 and @xmath187 are considered .",
    "they are also orthogonal to the direction @xmath316 in which the photons travel .",
    "due to the symmetry of the lens it will be also useful to work in terms of the angle @xmath317 between the @xmath318axis and the path of the photon .    then , with this setting one notes",
    "that the component @xmath319 is a spin zero real quantity , and it depends on the @xmath320 coordinates , while the component @xmath321 is a spin two complex quantity and it has the functional dependence @xmath322 where the phase is gauge dependent .",
    "as it was mentioned in @xcite , it is usual to define the real quantity @xmath323 associated to the weyl contribution from @xmath324    with this definition one writes for the intrinsic optical scalars of the lens : @xmath325 where the complex shear is normally expressed in terms of its real and imaginary parts , namely @xmath326 .    the complex form for the shear components invite us to define the real quantity @xmath327 as @xmath328 so that one simply has @xmath329",
    "the common situation in the cosmological scenario is the one in which the typical size @xmath330 of the lens is much smaller than the distance from the observer to the lens @xmath331 , and than the distance from the lens to the source @xmath332 .",
    "this configuration is referred to as a thin lens .",
    "following the same lines presented in article @xcite we will assume that the perturbed scalars of curvature @xmath333 , denoted generically as @xmath334 will be sharply peaked around @xmath331 , where the lens is located .",
    "this implies that the following approximation must to hold @xmath335 where @xmath336 , @xmath337 and @xmath338 ( @xmath339 ) .",
    "we make use of this assumption to simplify the integrand inside of parenthesis in the expressions in equations ( [ eq : kappal ] , [ eq : gammal ] , [ eq : gamma2 ] ) .",
    "let us note that @xmath340 where it is clear that one must have @xmath341 .",
    "then , one can take another integral to arrive at reduced expressions for the optical scalars ; one finds @xmath342 where we have neglected terms of order @xmath343 .",
    "since the factor in the last equation will appear recurrently we define , for the sake of simplicity in the notation , the symbol : @xmath344    then , the intrinsic optical scalars of the lens acquire a simpler form : @xmath345 while the optical scalars of the whole system @xmath346 where , from the above notation one is using : @xmath347 and @xmath348    in the limit of no cosmological background one has that @xmath20 converges to @xmath17 and @xmath349 so that in this way one arrives at the usual expressions found in the studies of gravitational lenses over a flat background@xcite .",
    "the term , @xmath350 , which only contains information about the cosmology , can be written in a more clarifying form using the coordinates @xmath351 discussed in section [ subsec : inertial - u ] .",
    "in fact , we show that the integrand appearing in equation ( [ eq : dls - factor ] ) is a total derivative along the null geodesic .",
    "let us note that from equation ( [ eq : dr - dchi - du ] ) and the fact that @xmath352 one has the following relation @xmath353 which means that @xmath354 where it must be understood that @xmath355 is the redshift at the place of the lens and @xmath356 is the angular diameter distance measured by a fundamental observer at the coordinates @xmath357 @xmath358 in what follows we will use a short notation in which we only retain the subindex of the coordinate @xmath138 , namely : @xmath359    it is interesting to remark that in the limit of a close observation one has @xmath360 and @xmath361 ; so that again one arrives at the expressions found in the studies of gravitational lenses over a flat background in this regime .",
    "however , in a strict sense , one should note that we have found that @xmath350 does not coincides with the usual quotient of distances appearing in text books @xcite ; where the behavior of the optical scalars is expressed in terms of the integral of the mass content of the lens and the factor involving the _ critical surface mass density _ @xmath362 defined in the literature @xcite as @xmath363 then , up to the numerical factor with the physical constants , which in our results is contained in the integrals ( [ eq : hatfi ] ) , ( [ eq : hatpsi ] ) ; we note that the factor involving the redshift of the lens is missing .",
    "this means that it is wrong to generalize the common expressions appearing in weak lensing studies in the case of a flat background to the cosmological scenario , just by changing distances to angular diameter distances .",
    "let us consider the case in which locally , the gravitational lens , is represented by a stationary spherically symmetric line element .",
    "then , in a neighbourhood of the lens , we can set a coordinate system where the line element of the geometry can be expressed as : @xmath364 which is completely determined by the functions @xmath365 and @xmath366 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the thin lens approximation as given in expressions ( [ eq : thin - optical - scalar])-([eq : thin - optical - scalar3 ] ) can be applied to this situation .",
    "when this is done one notes also that the information provided by the underlined cosmology will appear only trough the factor ( [ eq : dls ] ) containing the angular diameter distances and the redshift .",
    "furthermore , comparing the above equations ( [ eq : thin - optical - scalar])-([eq : thin - optical - scalar3 ] ) with equations ( 78)-(80 ) of reference @xcite , and realizing that in the thin lens approximation , what matters is the impact parameter @xmath314 from the center ; one can note that all the discussion of section v of @xcite can be applied also to the cosmological scenario .",

    "we follow the standard framework for the study of gravitational lens effects , in which one compares the lensed situation with the unlensed one ; in which no curvature is present . in order to take into account the subleties appearing in the discussion of lenses over a curved spacetimes , such as r - w , it was necessary to review the basic language and interpretation of observations ; which has been done in section [ sec : grav - lens ] .",
    "in particular we have remarked that the natural and universal notion of distance , that can be applied to any spacetime , is the affine distance @xmath17 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the whole r - w geometry can be characterized as a gravitational lens in its own right ; which is thick , only producing convergence but not shear .",
    "it is also worthwhile to remark that our expressions for the convergence are valid for arbitrary large observing angles .",
    "we have studied also the existence of an additional lens in a r - w scenario , and have presented the general expressions for the optical scalars , namely equations ( [ eq : kappal])-([eq : gamma-2-general ] ) .",
    "one should note that in several works sometimes the effects of additional lenses are presented only with respect to a r - w background , which corresponds only to equations ( [ eq : kappal])-([eq : gamma2 ] ) ; but in this case one would miss some effects of cosmological origin , that we include here explicitly .",
    "the new expressions possess the interesting feature that they are not restricted to newtonian like distributions of massive scatterer ; instead , they allow for a very general class of energy - momentum tensors which make these formulas a useful tool to address some of the difficulties related to the missing mass problem in the universe . in this way we generalize expressions appearing in textbooks and premises of research articles@xcite .",
    "the thin lens approximation has proven@xcite to be a good working hypothesis for a variety of systems .",
    "surprisingly , when the thin lens approximation is considered we have noticed the appearance of a factor involving the redshift of the lens ; as is indicated in equation ( [ eq : dls - simplificado ] ) ; which has not been considered previously .",
    "this means that the straightforward change of angular diameter distance , used in the case of flat background , to the angular diameter distance used on a r - w background , is not enough to obtain the complete expression .",
    "we remark this because several authors have suggested this wrong technique , as for example in reference @xcite ; where the factor involving the redshift is missing . in relation to this , let us observe that , at redshift @xmath394@xcite , all the intrinsic optical scalars are affected by cosmic correction of @xmath395 ( see equations ( [ eq : thin - optical - scalar])-([eq : thin - optical - scalar3 ] ) . )    these equations are additionally useful and relevant to works concerning test of fundamental geometric relations in observational cosmology ; which are based on the use of gravitational lensing@xcite .",
    "we have considered few classic examples of static and spherically symmetric lenses , and applied the equations for the gravitational lens optical scalars .",
    "this is easily done , since we have provided with expressions that relate the optical scalars to the matter content of the lens .",
    "the connection with the observed magnitudes is done with the introduction of the intensity magnification @xmath0 , defined in terms of the fluxes , and we have also provided with an expression of the _ distance modulus _ @xmath396 , in terms of it , given in equations ( [ eq : m - m ] ) and ( [ eq : m - m_2 ] ) . in order to make contact with the way in which the community describes the behavior of the distance modulus , we have also introduce an astrophysical cosmic intensity magnification @xmath270 that is thought as a function of redshift .",
    "one can also express the distance modulus in terms of this magnification as we have done in ( [ eq : m - m_astro ] ) .",
    "it is important to remark that the physical intensity magnification @xmath0 turns out to depend only on the affine distance @xmath17 ; and that it coincides with the gravitational lens magnification @xmath2 .",
    "therefore the distance modulus as expressed in equation ( [ eq : m - m_2 ] ) , valid in a general spacetime , only depends on the gravitational lens scalars and kinematical data .",
    "instead , when expressing the distance modulus in terms of the astrophysical cosmic intensity magnification @xmath270 , it requires the assumption of a cosmological model , so that a distance - redshift relations can be applied .",
    "it is for this reason that something very peculiar happened with the way in which the data of supernovae has been studied , namely : one can see from equations ( [ eq : m - m_2 ] ) and ( [ eq . dev geo ] ) that , since in the calculation of the gravitational lens optical scalars only intervene the traceless part of the ricci tensor and the weyl tensor , the observations of the supernovae fluxes do not depend on a possible cosmological constant , which only affects the trace of the ricci tensor .",
    "however in celebrated works , as @xcite , the authors have studied the relation between the behavior of the supernovae fluxes with redshift , by the use of equation ( [ eq : m - m_astro ] ) with the assumption of a cosmological model , and argued that a cosmological constant explains the observations . the peculiarity is also related to this : from tables [ tab : planck-2 ] and [ tab : baryonic ] one can see that the physical intensity magnification @xmath239 is always greater than one ; so that if one applies ( [ eq : m - m_2 ] ) to describe the observed luminosity supernovae , one would find that they are brighter than in the flat case ; instead , in the analysis of @xcite the claim is that since the observed luminosity of supernovae is fainter ( see table [ tab : planck-2 ] ) than expected as a function of redshift , then a cosmological constant would account for it .",
    "it should be noticed that our arguments leading to the new expression ( [ eq : m - m_2 ] ) , should not be confused with the standard arguments involving the statements of constant surface brightness as appear in textbooks@xcite .",
    "our argument relies on the validity of the etherington theorem , which is applicable to general spacetimes and classes of lenses ; instead the other argument makes use of the liouville theorem .    within the approximation of thin lenses",
    "we have considered configurations with a single lens but the treatment can easily be extended to complex arrangements of several lenses .",
    "that is , one could consider having @xmath397 lenses , placed at cosmological distances @xmath398 , and apply the techniques explained above .",
    "we will tackle this problem in a further work .",
    "in this appendix we present a list of the geometric quantities that we have employed for the description of the r - w spacetime in terms of the ghp formalism @xcite .",
    "we have taken the most relevant null tetrad for our purpose , namely those presented in subsection ( [ subsec : inertial - u ] ) .",
    "for simplicity we present the expressions in terms of comoving coordinates .",
    "since robertson - walker geometries are conformally flat , its geometry is characterized only by its connection and the ricci curvature since its weyl tensor vanishes .",
    "@xmath399      @xmath400",
    "the dynamical evolution of the scale factor @xmath401 satisfies the friedman equations when einstein equation are imposed : @xmath402 here @xmath269 is as usual the cosmological constant and @xmath403 another constant which takes different values depending on the used units .",
    "the usual energy - momentum tensor for a perfect fluid compatible with the geometry has the form : @xmath404 where @xmath258 and @xmath259 are the corresponding energy density and isotropic pressure measured by the preferred observers at rest with the fluid",
    ".          for a cosmological fluid composed of radiation and particles of dust one introduces the so - called _ density parameters _ which are dimensionless quantities in terms of which one can parametrize the space of solutions .    in terms of the hubble s constant @xmath407 and the _ critical density _",
    "@xmath263 which is given by @xmath408 the _ density parameters _ are defined as @xmath409 where @xmath410 and @xmath411 are respectively the energy density corresponding to the radiation and dust components .    in this case",
    "one can write the friedman equations in the very compact form : @xmath412 @xmath413 where we have used the definition of the _ deceleration parameter _ @xmath414 in the second equation : @xmath415    let us note that evaluating ( [ eq : friedmans ] ) at present time , one has @xmath416 from which one can calculate @xmath120 in terms of the present cosmic abundances ; while in the case @xmath74 one has a freedom in the value of @xmath120 which can be taken as @xmath417 .",
