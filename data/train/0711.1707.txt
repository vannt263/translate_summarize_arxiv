    "the electromagnetic field behaves at different conditions either as pure quantum or almost as a classical field .",
    "but for non - abelian gauge fields we know only quantum manifestations of these fields . here we would like to present the idea that classical non - abelian gauge fields can become visible as dm .",
    "the problem of the dm nature is now one of the most fundamental problems in modern physics .",
    "the reason is to explain the invisibility of dm it is necessary to involve such kinds of an exotic matter as , for example , wimp , supersymmetric particles etc .    in this article",
    "we offer a new model of dm . in the studied model",
    "the dm is an interior of an abortive singularity or black hole .",
    "we understand this suggestion as follows .    in ref s",
    "@xcite  @xcite it is shown that the energy density of spherically symmetric solutions of yang - mills equations may have non - standard behavior ( behind an exception , of course , t hooft - polyakov monopole ) .",
    "for example , in ref .  @xcite it is shown that the energy density is weakly decreasing .",
    "it is natural that such distribution of the matter will give diverging solutions by switching on the gravity .",
    "for some boundary conditions at the center it will be an interior of a non - abelian back hole and for other values of the boundary conditions a singularity located at some distance from the center will appear . but one very interesting subtlety exists here .",
    "this solutions are classical ones .",
    "the careful analysis shows that at the infinity these solutions are strongly oscillating in the space ( gravity is switched off ) and the period of the oscillations increases by moving away from the centre .",
    "it is obvious that on some distance from the center the quantum fluctuations of gauge field on the period distance of oscillations become comparable with a field magnitude .",
    "it means that at this distance the gauge field becomes quantum one .",
    "the problem in calculating of such distribution of the non - abelian gauge field is that the gauge field becomes essentially non - perturbative and it is impossible to apply the perturbative feynman diagram techniques to its description .",
    "the idea presented here is that the radius where the gauge field becomes quantum can be less than the radius of a singular or an event horizon corresponding to a non - abelian black hole . in this case",
    "this object does become neither a singularity nor a black hole ( abortive singularity / black hole ) .",
    "it looks as follows : in space there is a sphere filled with a classical gauge field and on border of this sphere the non - abelian gauge field becomes quantum one and the mass contained in this sphere is not enough for formation of a singularity or an event horizon .",
    "the color gauge field in the sphere does not interact with the elementary particles because the particles are colorless and consequently this classical field is invisible and can be applied as a candidate of dm .",
    "in fact in this paper we consider the idea that in a non - abelian gauge theory may exist such space distribution of a gauge field that classical and quantum phases exist simultaneously but spatially separated . in this case",
    "the jump condition from classical phase to quantum one is the strong oscillations of classical non - abelian field .",
    "these oscillations leads to the fact that quantum fluctuations become essential at a distance of oscillation period .",
    "in other words the space is filled with a non - perturbative gauge vacuum where there exist defects filled with the classical gauge field .",
    "the galaxies are located in these defects and the classical gauge field is the dm .",
    "in this section we would like to show that usually the su(3 ) gauge field distribution leads to a singular spacetime .",

    "it means that we should start the solution from the point @xmath8 .",
    "the analytical solution close to the center is @xmath9 the numerical solution can not start from the point @xmath8 since eq s - have terms @xmath10",
    ". consequently we should start from the point @xmath11 .",

    "consequently the numerical analysis have shown us that at the point @xmath17 where @xmath18 there is a real or coordinate singularity ( for some boundary conditions it will be an event horizon ) . from fig .",
    "[ v_r ] we see that the function @xmath19 is oscillating function and the period of oscillations increases with the moving away from the center . at some distance @xmath20 from the center the quantum fluctuations on the distance of period will be comparable with the field magnitude . in this case",
    "the classical gauge field becomes quantum one .",
    "if it occurs on the distance @xmath21 then we will have a ball filled with the classical gauge field inside quantum gauge field . in ref .",
    "@xcite is claimed that the non - perturbative quantized su(3 ) gauge field can be described using two scalar fields .",
    "these fields decrease very quickly ( exponentially ) to a ground state . if this",
    "so then the situation looks as follows : in the space there is a ball filled with the classical gauge field with weakly decreasing energy density . at some distance @xmath20 from the center",
    "the field becomes quantum one and the energy density very quickly ( exponentially ) decreases to a ground state ( non - perturbative vacuum ) .",
    "the idea presented here is that the ball can be considered as the dm as usual elementary particles are colorless and consequently can not interact with the color classical su(3 ) gauge fields .",
    "let us note that non - abelian black holes and particlelike solutions exist only with a special choice of the boundary conditions on the event horizon or at the center .",
    "we have to underline that in contrast with the non - abelian black holes and particlelike solutions we consider the solutions with arbitrary boundary conditions .    in the following sections we will estimate the radius @xmath17 of a real / coordinate singularity and the radius @xmath20 where the transition from the classical phase to quantum one occurs .",
    "unfortunately the solution presented in previous section is numerical one that does not allow us to calculate the sphere where the above mentioned singularity ( real or coordinate ) is .",
    "we will estimate the radius of a singular sphere ( using newton gravity ) in the following way .",
    "the radius is estimated as the place where the newtonian gravitational potential becomes so strong that a test particle should have a velocity of light to get from this point on infinity .",
    "we test this method for the schwazschild black hole solution .",
    "the energy conservation law tells us @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the newtonian constant ; the first and second terms are kinetic and potential energies of a test particle with the mass @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the mass of a singularity or a black hole . as a result",
    "we have the radius of a singularity or an event horizon @xmath26 that absolutely precisely coincides with the event horizon radius calculated in general relativity .",
    "now we will try to estimate the radius of the singularity or the event horizon for the classical distribution of the su(3 ) gauge fields - .",
    "we will work in newton gravity because the values @xmath27 and @xmath28 are small enough , i.e. the magnitudes of the su(3 ) gauge fields close to the center are small enough . in this case",
    "yang - mills equations in a flat space are @xmath29 and with ansatz - where @xmath7 we have the following equations @xmath30 here the dimensionless radius @xmath31 is introduced and @xmath32 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "in fact eq s are eq s in minkowski spacetime .",
