    "hot molecular cores ( hereafter hmcs ) are small , dense , hot , and dark molecular clumps , usually found in the proximity of ultracompact hii regions ( e.g. , kurtz et al . 2000 ) . unlike hii regions , these objects present weak or undetectable free - free emission .",
    "the lack of free - free emission has been interpreted as due to an intense mass accretion phase that quenches the development of an hii region ( e.g. , walmsley 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , these hmcs may be the precursors of hii regions , tracing the earliest observable stage in the life of massive stars .",
    "a detailed modeling of the emission of the hmcs is a necessary requirement to assess their physical nature and their relationship with the birth of massive protostars .",
    "osorio , lizano , & dalessio ( 1999 ) showed that the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the dust continuum emission of several hmcs without detectable free - free emission is consistent with that of a massive envelope collapsing onto a b type star , with an age less than @xmath9 yr , and accreting mass at a rate of @xmath10@xmath11 .",
    "these intense mass accretion rates are high enough to prevent the development of an ionized region around the central star .",
    "the physical properties of the hmcs were inferred using the collapse of the singular logatropic sphere ( sls ; mclaughlin & pudritz 1997 ) as a dynamical model for the envelope .",
    "the sls collapse models were chosen because these envelopes are massive enough to reproduce the strong millimeter emission observed , without requiring excessively high mass accretion rates , thus preventing excessive emission in the near and mid infrared ( see more details in osorio et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "one can further test osorio s models , including the velocity field of the accreting envelopes , by comparing their expected molecular emission with observations of appropriate molecular tracers .",
    "high - excitation ammonia transitions are well suited for this kind of comparison , since they trace the hot and warm dense gas in the hmcs , and can be observed with subarcsecond angular resolution using the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "such observations are among the highest angular resolution molecular line data of hmcs that can be obtained at present , allowing to determine the variations of the line intensity across the sources .",
    "furthermore , the ammonia lines have hyperfine structure that is sensitive to the optical depth and permit an accurate measurement of the column density .    in order to do this test , we selected the hmc located @xmath12 to the southwest of the peak of the g31.41 + 0.31 ultracompact hii region . hereafter , we will call this source g31 hmc .",
    "this hmc is located at a distance of 7.9 kpc ( cesaroni et al . 1998 ) .",
    "it is an interesting hmc because it exhibits strong millimeter continuum emission , as well as molecular emission of high excitation lines ; it is associated with a group of water masers , and with a bipolar outflow ( cesaroni et al .",
    "1994 , 1998 ; gibb , wyrowski & mundy 2004 ) .",
    "the presence of high excitation molecular emission in this luminous source indicates that g31 hmc ( together with a few other objects ; beuther & walsh 2008 , longmore et al .",
    "2007 ) is one of the hottest molecular cores discovered so far . the lack of strong free - free centimeter emission ( araya et al .",
    "2003 ) indicates that g31 hmc could be in a phase of intense mass accretion , being unable to develop a detectable hii region .",
    "therefore , we consider g31 hmc as a good candidate to test the basic hypothesis of osorio s model , namely , that young massive stars are formed inside hmcs with very high accretion rates . in this model",
    "the onset of a detectable ultracompact hii region is quenched by the very high mass accretion rate .",
    "g31 hmc has a database of continuum flux density measurements covering a wide range of wavelengths although , unfortunately , most of the data points were obtained with relatively poor angular resolution and the sed is poorly constrained for @xmath13 m .",
    "g31 hmc is associated with line transitions from a variety of molecular species , such as hco@xmath14 , sio ( maxia et al . 2001 ) , @xmath15co ( olmi et al . 1996 ) , cs ( anglada et al .",
    "1996 ) , h@xmath16s , c@xmath17o ( gibb , mundy & wyrowski 2004 ) , and ch@xmath18cn ( beltrn et al . 2005 ) .",
    "particularly interesting is the association of g31 hmc with strong ammonia emission ( churchwell et al .",
    "1990 , cesaroni et al .",
    "1992 ) whose ( 4,4 ) inversion transition has been observed with subarcsecond angular resolution using the vla ( cesaroni et al .",
    "1998 ; see their figs .",
    "2c , 4c , and 9c ) .",
    "this makes g31 hmc one of the few sources where a high signal - to - noise ratio analysis of the spatial variation of the ammonia emission along the core can be carried out .",
    "the high intensity of the observed ammonia ( 4,4 ) emission , the ratio of the main to satellite lines close to unity , as well as the unusually large line widths indicate extreme physical conditions that suggest that this core is harboring an o type star . because of this , we chose g31 hmc as a candidate to test the molecular emission predictions of the osorio s model for the early stages of the formation of massive stars .",
    "we note that vla observations at 7 mm ( araya et al .",
    "2003 ) reveal the presence of a binary system at the center of g31 hmc .",
    "however , the model of osorio et al .",
    "( 1999 ) is spherically symmetric , with a single central source of luminosity .",
    "this assumption is valid as long as the binary separation ( @xmath19 ) is much smaller than the observed size of the hmc ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "likewise , deviations from spherical symmetry either by rotation ( disks ) or by an intrinsic elongation of the cloud are not considered by osorio s model . to test non - spherical models , one must include high angular resolution mid - ir data that would allow to properly constrain parameters such as the degree of flattening of the envelope , the centrifugal radius , or the effect of a disk and/or cavities caused by outflows .",
    "this kind of data has been obtained for other hmcs and is highly sensitive to the geometry of the cloud ( e.g. , de buizer , osorio & calvet 2005 ) .",
    "unfortunately , such observations are not yet available for g31 hmc .    observations of several molecular tracers reveal , however , the existence of small velocity gradients in g31 hmc that have been interpreted as suggestive of either outflow ( gibb , wyrowski , & mundy 2004 , araya et al . 2008 ) or rotation motions ( beltrn et al . 2005 ) .",
    "sensitive high angular resolution observations are needed to clarify this issue . despite the possible presence of small velocity gradients",
    ", we expect the kinematics of the core to be dominated by the overall infall motions of the envelope . in this work",
    "we assume that the spherically symmetric models of osorio et al .",
    "( 1999 ) are adequate to study the dust continuum and molecular line emission of g31 hmc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in @xmath21",
    ", we describe the modeling procedure , in @xmath22 we present the observational data available from the literature , in @xmath23 we model the dust and ammonia data and we compare our results with the observations , as well as with other modeling attempts of this source reported in the literature .",
    "finally , in @xmath24 we summarize our conclusions .",
    "following osorio et al . ( 1999 ) , we model a hmc as a spherically symmetric envelope of dust and gas that is collapsing onto a recently formed central massive star .",
    "an accretion shock is formed at the stellar surface .",
    "thus , the stellar radiation and the accretion luminosity provide the source of heating of the envelope .",
    "the temperature of the envelope is a function of the distance to the center .",
    "the density , infall velocity , and turbulent velocity dispersion for each point of the envelope are obtained from the solution of the dynamical collapse of the sls ( mclaughlin & pudritz 1997 ) .",
    "the parameters of the sls model are chosen by calculating the emerging dust emission , assuming a constant dust to gas mass ratio along the envelope , and fitting the observed sed .    once obtained the physical conditions in the envelope from the fit to the observed sed , the excitation of the ammonia molecule is calculated and the radiative transfer is performed in order to obtain the emerging ammonia spectra for different lines of sight towards the envelope . in these calculations , the gas - phase ammonia abundance , that is a function of radius , is the only free parameter .",
    "we consider two simple cases : uniform gas - phase abundance and uniform total ammonia abundance . in the latter case , the ratio of gas to solid phase ammonia as a function of radius is determined by calculating the balance between condensation and sublimation of molecules on dust grains .",
    "the gas - phase ammonia abundance is constrained by comparing the ammonia model spectra with the observed spectra towards different positions .      for the collapsing envelope",
    ", we adopt the density , @xmath25 , infall velocity , @xmath26 , and turbulent velocity dispersion , @xmath27 , distributions resulting from the solution of the self - similar collapse of the sls ( adams , lizano & shu 1987 , unpublished notes ) .",
    "the sls has a logatropic pressure , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a constant that sets the pressure scale , and @xmath30 is an arbitrary reference density , introduced by lizano & shu ( 1989 ) to empirically take into account the observed turbulent motions in molecular clouds .",
    "the collapse of the sls has been studied by mclaughlin & pudritz ( 1996 , 1997 ; hereafter mp97 ) , and it has been generalized by reid , pudritz & wadsley ( 2002 ) , and sigalotti , de felice & sira ( 2002 ) to include three - dimensional hydrodynamic calculations of the collapse of both singular and nonsingular logatropic spheres .    in the sls collapse solution",
    "an expansion wave moves outward into a static cloud and sets the gas into motion towards the central star . both the speed of the expansion wave and the mass accretion rate increase with time .",
    "the radius of the expansion wave is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the time elapsed since the onset of collapse .",
    "outside the radius of the expansion wave ( @xmath33 ) , the sls envelope is static , @xmath34 and the density is given by @xmath35    inside the expansion wave ( @xmath36 ) , the infall velocity , whose direction is radial , is given by @xmath37 having a free - fall behavior for @xmath38 .",
    "the density is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the similarity variable , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are non - dimensional functions . with this normalization the expansion wave is located at @xmath43 .",
    "the self - similar variable , and the density and velocity functions are related to those tabulated by mclaughlin & pudritz ( 1997 ) through @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , where the subindex `` mp '' labels the mclaughlin & pudritz ( 1997 ) solution .    as noted by osorio et al .",
    "( 1999 ) the sls collapse tends to produce massive envelopes , since inside the radius of the expansion wave only 3% of the mass is in the central star , while 97% is in the collapsing envelope .",
    "the velocity dispersion inside the envelope due to turbulent motions is obtained assuming that alfvn waves in the cloud induce fluid motions with velocity amplitudes , @xmath47 , of the order of the wave speed , @xmath48 , where the magnitude of the magnetic field is @xmath49 . for random polarizations and random orientations of the magnetic field in the cloud ,",
    "the one - dimensional velocity dispersion in the line - of - sight direction is given by @xmath50 where the factor 1/3 comes from averaging over the solid angle the square of the magnetic field projections along the line of sight .",
    "the physical structure of the sls collapse is characterized by the constant @xmath29 and the time elapsed since the onset of collapse , @xmath32 . in terms of familiar variables , this elapsed time is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mass accretion rate , and @xmath53 is the mass of the central star .",
    "@xmath29 can be written as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the reduced ( dimensionless ) mass . from now on ,",
    "we will use @xmath53 and @xmath52 to characterize the dynamical model .",
    "the total source of heating of the envelope , @xmath56 , is assumed to be the sum of the stellar luminosity , @xmath57 , and the accretion luminosity , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the stellar radius .",
    "a value of @xmath60 cm has been adopted ( see osorio et al . 1999 ,",
    "hosokawa & omukai 2008 ) .",
    "the stellar luminosity is related to the stellar mass using the schaller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) evolutionary tracks .",
    "the temperature of the dust grains inside the envelope , @xmath61 , is self - consistently calculated from the total luminosity using the condition of radiative equilibrium for outer optically thin regions of the envelope , whereas for the inner optically thick regions the temperature is calculated from the standard diffusion approximation ( see details in osorio et al .",
    "1999 ) .    for temperatures @xmath62",
    "k and densities @xmath63 @xmath64 , the gas and dust are well coupled and are described by the same temperature ( e.g. , sweitzer 1978 ; doty et al .",
    "our models fulfill this condition and , thus , the kinetic temperature of the gas , @xmath65 , is taken to coincide with the temperature obtained from the dust calculations , @xmath66 .",
    "assuming that the dust grains shield the molecules from the intense central radiation field , the dust destruction front , at the dust sublimation temperature ( @xmath67 k ) , determines the inner radius , @xmath68 , of the dust and molecular envelope .",
    "the external radius , @xmath69 , of the envelope is inferred from the observations .      to solve the radiative transfer equation for the dust emission we have the geometry depicted in figure  [ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "given the spherical symmetry of the envelope , the emergent specific intensity , @xmath70 , for a given line of sight is only a function of the impact parameter , @xmath71 , the distance between the line of sight and the center of the envelope .",
    "assuming that the source function of the thermal dust emission is the planck function evaluated at the dust temperature , @xmath72 , we have the following set of equations that allow us to obtain the emerging intensity as a function of frequency and impact parameter , @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the background intensity , @xmath77 is the monochromatic dust absorption coefficient per unit mass , @xmath78 is the coordinate along the line of sight ( @xmath79 ) , positive in the direction away from the observer , and whose origin is in the plane perpendicular to the line of sight that contains the center of the envelope ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "the integration limits @xmath80 and @xmath81 correspond to the edges of the envelope nearest and farthest to the observer , respectively , being @xmath82 . in the absence of a strong background source ,",

    "( 1999 ) , the dust absorption coefficient , @xmath77 , at high frequencies ( @xmath86 ghz ) is obtained from dalessio ( 1996 ) , who considered spherical ( mie ) particles of graphites , silicates , iron , and water ice compounds , with the standard grain - size distribution of the interstellar medium , @xmath87 ( mathis , rumpl , & nordsieck 1977 ) , with a minimum radius of 0.005 @xmath88 m and a maximum radius of 0.3 @xmath88 m . the abundance and optical constants of the compounds",
    "were taken from draine & lee ( 1984 ) , draine ( 1987 ) , and warren ( 1984 ) .",
    "the value of the absorption coefficient at 1500 ghz obtained for this dust composition and size distribution can be extrapolated to lower frequencies in the standard power - law form , resulting @xmath89 @xmath90 g@xmath3 for @xmath91 ghz .",
    "the value of the index @xmath92 is adopted so that it is consistent with the slope of the optically thin millimeter emission of the observed sed , where @xmath93 .",
    "we assumed a constant dust - to - gas mass ratio of 0.01 .",
    "depending of the wavelength , the dalessio ( 1996 ) opacities can be a factor of up to 2 - 3 times lower than those of ossenkopf & henning ( 1994 ) .",
    "both opacity models have been successfully used to reproduce the sed of other high mass star forming cores ( osorio et al 1999 , van der tak et al 2000 ) .",
    "once the emergent intensity as a function of the impact parameter is obtained , the total flux density of the source at a given frequency is calculated as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the distance of the observer to the source .",
    "finally , the resulting model sed is calculated and compared with the observed sed .",
    "a grid of models is run with different values of the free parameters @xmath96 and @xmath53 ( or , equivalently , @xmath57 ) . in this way , the model ( or models ) that are consistent with the observed sed are determined .",
    "note that in case the sed is not well constrained , more than one model can be consistent with the data .",
    "further details on the method are described by osorio et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .      in this section ,",
    "we describe the calculation of the emerging intensity of the ammonia inversion transitions arising from a spherically symmetric envelope with the physical properties obtained from the dust modeling using the sls solution .",
    "the physics of the ammonia molecule is studied in detail in townes & slawlow ( 1975 ) , ho ( 1975 ) , and ho & townes ( 1983 ) .",
    "here we only summarize some basic information that may be relevant to our discussion . because ammonia is a symmetric top molecule , its rotational energy levels are described by two quantum numbers , namely , the total angular momentum , @xmath97 , and its projection on the symmetry axis , @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) . rotational levels with @xmath100 are more populated and are called metastable , while rotational levels with @xmath101 are short - lived and are called non - metastable . all rotational levels ( except those with @xmath102 ) are split into inversion doublets .",
    "the transitions between these inversion doublets are called inversion transitions and occur at wavelengths of @xmath81.3 cm .    as shown in appendix  [ apentex ] , the excitation temperature of the ammonia inversion transitions can be obtained from a two - level model . for a given point of coordinate @xmath78 along a line of sight of impact parameter @xmath71",
    ", we can estimate the excitation temperature , @xmath103 , from equation  ( [ eq : dosni2 ] ) , taking the total number density of gas molecules as @xmath104 ) , where @xmath105 is the mean molecular weight in the envelope and @xmath106 is the hydrogen mass . in the calculation of @xmath107",
    "we will approximate the intensity of the local radiation field by the background intensity ( @xmath108 ) . with this approximation , equation  ( [ eq : dosni2 ] )",
    "gives a lower limit for the excitation temperature .",
    "however , as shown in appendix  [ apentex ] , for the physical conditions of hmcs the values obtained in this way are very close to the value of the kinetic temperature , which , for thermal lines , is an upper limit for the excitation temperature",
    ". therefore , this indicates that taking @xmath109 is a very good approximation for the calculation of the excitation temperature in hmcs .",
    "note that , with this approximation , the resulting excitation temperature will become a spherically symmetric function , @xmath110 .",
    "the spectra of the inversion transitions present a hyperfine structure due to the interaction of the electric quadrupole momentum of the nitrogen nucleus with the electric field of the electrons .",
    "this effect splits the line into five components , the central main line , and two pairs of satellite lines , separated @xmath81 - 2 mhz , symmetrically placed about the main line .",
    "these hyperfine components are further split by weaker magnetic spin interactions . since",
    "the separation between the magnetic hyperfine components is only @xmath810 - 40 khz ( 0.1 - 0.5 km s@xmath3 ) , they are distinguishable only in very high spectral resolution observations of regions with very low velocity dispersion .",
    "for this reason , we neglect the magnetic hyperfine structure , and we restrict our analysis to only the five electric quadrupole hyperfine components .    as shown in appendix  [ apenkappa ] ( eq .  [ [ eq : opafinal ] ] ) , the absorption coefficient of the ammonia @xmath111 inversion transition , at a given point of coordinate @xmath78 along a line of sight of impact parameter @xmath71 ( see fig .  [",

    "note that the excitation temperature , @xmath107 , and the einstein spontaneous emission coefficient , @xmath128 , are those of the entire inversion transition , unsplit by hyperfine interactions ( eq .  [ [ eq : dosni2 ] ] and table  [ tbl : inver ] , respectively ) . due to the dipolar selection rules on the rotational transitions ,",
    "the populations of the metastable levels are mainly determined by collisions ; therefore , @xmath129 , that is defined by the relative populations of the rotational levels is expected to be similar to the kinetic temperature .",
    "in fact , @xmath129 is a lower limit of @xmath65 , and its value is different for each pair of rotational levels considered ( see appendix  [ apenkappa ] ) .",
    "however , the agreement between @xmath129 and @xmath65 is expected to improve for high metastable levels , due to the increased excitation involved , and for high densities , where all temperatures tend to thermalize to @xmath65 ( e.g. , walmsley & ungerechts 1983 ; danby et al . 1988 ; wilson et al . 2006 ) .",

    "finally , in order to make an accurate comparison with the observations , the emergent intensity is convolved ( in 2-d ) with a gaussian with a fwhm equal to that of the observing beam , and a velocity smoothing is applied to reproduce the spectral resolution of the spectrometer .",

    "the main results of the continuum flux density measurements in the wavelength range @xmath152 m to 1.3 cm are summarized in table  [ datos ] .",
    "most of these observations did not have the angular resolution required to separate the emission of the hmc from that of the g31.41 + 0.31 uchii region , whose emission peak is only @xmath12 apart .",

    "the observed sed of g31 hmc is characterized by strong millimeter emission suggesting the presence of either a hot or a dense envelope ( or a combination of both ) . therefore ,",
    "`` a priori '' we expect the models that are able to fit the observed sed to be characterized by a high mass accretion rate .",

    "we set the external radius to @xmath69 = 30,000  au , a value inferred from the observed images of the source ( e.g. , cesaroni et al .",
    "1994a , maxia et al . 2001 ) and required to reproduce the large flux densities observed in the millimeter range .",
    "because of the incompleteness of the observed sed of g31 hmc , there is more than one model that can fit the available observational data . in table",
    "[ tbl5 ] we give the parameters of a set of models ( corresponding to values of the stellar mass listed in the tables of schaller et al .",
    "1992 ) that are consistent with the observed sed .",
    "the higher luminosity ( and hotter envelope ) model consistent with the observed sed has a central star with a mass of @xmath159 and an accretion rate of @xmath160 .",
    "models with @xmath161 produce far- and mid - ir flux densities that exceed the observational constraints .",
    "lower luminosity models ( @xmath162 ) that are consistent with the sed data have colder envelopes , but they have a higher density ( see the values of the temperature and density at @xmath163 au listed in the table ) in order to account for the strong millimeter emission observed in g31 hmc , resulting in higher values for the mass of the envelope .",
    "note that a low value of @xmath53 does not imply that the source is a low - mass protostar since in table  [ tbl5 ] the models with the smaller central mass are also the younger sources , meaning simply that the time elapsed since the onset of collapse , @xmath32 , is still too short to accumulate a massive central object .",
    "in fact , as can be seen in the table , these models are associated with the more massive envelopes and would eventually form the higher mass stars .",
    "the value of the inner radius of the envelope , @xmath68 , is @xmath164 au for model i ( @xmath159 ) and gets smaller as the mass of the central star decreases .",
    "we note that in all these models the radius of the expansion wave , @xmath165 , is smaller than the radius of the core , @xmath69 ; therefore , the outermost regions of these envelopes are static . also , the infall accretion rates in these models are so high that the accretion luminosity is the most important source of energy . for a given value of @xmath53 , the observational uncertainties in the sed data points result in a variation of @xmath166 in the possible values of @xmath52 that are consistent with the data .",

    "this figure shows that model i can not reproduce the observed behavior of the ammonia emission as a function of impact parameter . for a low ammonia abundance ( left column )",
    ", the main line reaches the observed brightness temperature of @xmath172 k in the @xmath173 panel ; however , the satellite lines are too weak in all the panels . increasing the ammonia abundance ( middle and right columns )",
    "produces an increase of the intensity of the satellite lines , that reach a value close to the observed one ( @xmath172 k ) in the @xmath71 = 0 au panel of the right column .",
    "nevertheless , in this panel the main line reaches a brightness temperature of only @xmath5 k , which is much smaller than the observed value .",
    "this occurs because the main line is very optically thick ( reaching an opacity of @xmath174 ) and , thus , the brightness temperature must be roughly equal to the kinetic temperature of the outer parts of the envelope model , which are cold .",
    "note that the brightness temperature of the satellite lines is higher since their opacity is 60 times lower , and they can reach the inner parts of the envelope where the temperatures are higher .",
    "models ii to xi are colder than model i ( see fig .  [ fields ] ) and therefore , they are worse in reproducing the observed behavior of the ammonia emission . as for model",
    "i , for a low abundance the satellite lines are too weak in all the panels .",
    "the intensity of the satellite lines increases with the ammonia abundance but , as in model i , for high ammonia abundances the main line becomes very optically thick in the @xmath71 = 0 au panels ( @xmath175 ) and only traces cold material from the outer envelope .",
    "since models ii to xi are colder than model i , the line intensities are lower and remain well below the observed values .    clearly , there is no hope to reproduce the observations with constant values of the ammonia abundance .",
    "a high optical depth is required to reproduce the intense satellite lines , but this high opacity prevents that the main line is formed in the inner , hottest regions resulting in a main line brightness temperature too low .",
    "nevertheless , the analysis of constant abundance suggests the alternative of having a low abundance in the outer envelope and a high abundance in the inner parts . in this way",
    ", the colder , outer parts of the envelope would have a smaller contribution to the observed emission , that would instead trace inner , higher temperatures .",
    "one expects that a compromise could be reached , in which the ammonia abundance in the outer parts of the envelope is low enough for the main line not to be saturated until reaching the inner , hotter regions , where the abundance may be high enough for even the satellite lines to become optically thick . in addition , having a low abundance in the outer parts of the envelope would prevent the main line to become saturated in the outer panels , helping to explain the observed decrease of the intensity of the main line as the impact parameter increases .",
    "the rationale for a variable ammonia abundance is provided by the calculation of the sublimation of molecules from dust grain mantles ( see appendix  [ apeneta ] ) .",
    "given the temperature gradient in the envelope , the outer parts have temperatures below that of sublimation of grain mantles and it is expected that most of the ammonia molecules are trapped there .",
    "the ammonia gas - phase abundance should increase drastically in the inner regions of the envelope , where the kinetic temperature reaches the sublimation temperature of the mantles and the ammonia molecules are released to the gas phase .",
    "therefore , inclusion of the process of sublimation of ammonia molecules from grain mantles should provide a more realistic description of the abundance distribution required in the calculation of the ammonia emission .    in order to try to fit the observed ammonia emission using a variable gas - phase ammonia abundance , we first ran a grid of cases with the ammonia abundance calculated using equation  ( [ eq : escalon ] ) , and with the ratio , @xmath176 , between the solid and gas phases given by equation  ( [ eq : etanh3 ] ) of appendix  [ apeneta ] ( that corresponds to direct sublimation of nh@xmath18 ices ) .",
    "this procedure assumes that most of the ammonia molecules are frozen into grain mantles in the outer parts of the envelope , being released to the gas phase at the ammonia sublimation temperature ( about 60 k ; see appendix  [ apeneta ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) . in this way",
    ", the gas - phase ammonia abundance behaves like a step function , with a minimum value , @xmath151 , in the external parts of the envelope ( where the temperature remains below the ammonia sublimation temperature ) , and increasing steeply to its maximum value , @xmath142 , for points inside the radius where the ammonia sublimation temperature is reached .",
    "we have explored values for the outer gas - phase nh@xmath18 abundance in the range @xmath177 , and in the range @xmath178 for the inner gas - phase nh@xmath18 abundance . however , none of the models resulting from the fit to the observed sed ( @xmath145  [ compardust ] ) is able to reproduce reasonably well the nh@xmath18(4,4 ) observations .",
    "the main problem is that the maximum brightness temperatures of the main line obtained with this kind of ammonia abundance distribution are too low ( @xmath179 k ) , to account for the peak brightness temperatures of @xmath172 k observed in g31 hmc .",
    "apparently , this occurs because the main line becomes optically thick in regions with temperatures of the order of 60 k , the temperature at which the bulk of ammonia molecules that were frozen in grain mantles are released to the gas phase .",
    "thus , the difficulties to fit simultaneously the main and satellite lines are similar to those of the case of a constant gas - phase ammonia abundance .",
    "as already mentioned , an alternative scenario is that ammonia molecules are mixed with water ice in grain mantles ( as suggested , e.g. , by ahearn et al .",
    "1987 for comets , and by brown et al .",
    "1988 and osorio 2000 for hmcs ) . in this case",
    ", ammonia molecules will be trapped in the grain mantles until temperatures high enough for sublimation of water molecules are reached .",
    "therefore , the gas - phase ammonia abundance will be described by equation  ( [ eq : escalon ] ) , where @xmath176 corresponds now to the water sublimation and is given by equation  ( [ eq : etah2o ] ) of appendix  [ apeneta ] .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : sketch ] , the transition from low to high gas - phase ammonia abundance occurs at a higher temperature ( @xmath172 k ) than in the case of pure ammonia sublimation . as a result , optically thick lines will trace hotter regions of the envelope , resulting in higher brightness temperatures .    as in the case of pure ammonia sublimation",
    "we ran a grid of cases with values for the outer gas - phase nh@xmath18 abundance in the range @xmath180 , and in the range @xmath181 for the inner gas - phase nh@xmath18 abundance .",
    "we found that models ii to xi can not fit the nh@xmath18 observations .",
    "the envelopes of the lower luminosity models ( @xmath182 ) are apparently too cold to fit the observed spectra .",
    "for these models the sublimation temperature of 100 k is reached at a radius @xmath183 au ( see fig .  [ fields ] ) , and therefore the spectra calculated for the outer impact parameters ( @xmath184 au ) behave very much like a case of constant gas - phase ammonia abundance equal to @xmath151 ( since the lines of sight for @xmath185 au only cross the outer regions of the envelope , whose temperatures remain below the sublimation temperature ) . since models ii to xi could not reproduce the observed spectra with a constant abundance , it is not expected that these models can fit the spectra in the outer panels , even with a variable gas - phase ammonia abundance . in summary ,",
    "models with @xmath182 are too cold to reproduce the observed properties of the nh@xmath18(4,4 ) spectra , even with a variable gas - phase nh@xmath18 abundance .    in contrast , we have been able to obtain a fairly good fit to the observed spectra using model i ( @xmath186 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : gridvariable ] ( central column ) we show our best fit spectra , obtained using this model with a value of @xmath187 and a value of @xmath188 .",
    "this set of parameters reproduces quite well the observed spectra .",
    "it reproduces the observed intensity ( @xmath189 k ) of the main line towards the center of the core ( @xmath173 ) , as well as the variation of its intensity as @xmath71 increases .",
    "it also reproduces the observed intensity of the satellite lines in the @xmath173 and @xmath190 au spectra . in the @xmath191 and @xmath192 au spectra",
    "the observed intensity of the satellite lines is somewhat stronger than predicted , but its signal - to - noise ratio is poor and therefore we consider this discrepancy less significant .",
    "lines are broad ( note that the satellite lines on each side of the main line appear blended ) , and the model also reproduces quite well the observed line widths ( @xmath193 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "interestingly , the best fit is obtained with values of the abundance for the cold and hot parts of the envelope that coincide respectively with the typical values inferred ( usually assuming a constant abundance ) from the observations of low mass ( cold ) and high mass ( hot ) star - forming cores ( see @xmath145  [ am1 ] ) , giving additional support to the goodness of the fit .    we also show in figure  [ fig : gridvariable ] two additional cases , corresponding to a lower value of the abundance in the hot region of the envelope , @xmath194 ( left column ) , and to a higher value of the abundance in the cold region , @xmath195 ( right column ) , to illustrate the behavior of the resulting spectra when varying these parameters .",
    "as figure [ fig : gridvariable ] illustrates , the satellite lines are mainly sensitive to variations in @xmath142 ( left and middle columns ) , whereas the main line is sensitive to variations in @xmath151 ( middle and right columns ) . at large values of @xmath71 ( @xmath71 = 10000 and 15000 au ) ,",
    "the spectra do not change by varying @xmath142 because the temperatures along these lines of sight are lower than 100 k and , therefore , sublimation will not occur .",
    "figure  [ fig : gridvariable ] ( left column ) also shows that an abundance of @xmath196 ( ten times lower than in the best fit ) in the inner regions of the envelope is high enough to reproduce the observed brightness temperature of the main line , but it is too low to reproduce the satellite lines . on the other hand ,",
    "as the right column shows , an abundance of @xmath197 in the outer parts of the envelope ( ten times higher than in the best fit model ) is adequate to reproduce the brightness temperature of the satellite lines , but not for the main line , whose peak brightness temperature decreases to a value below the observed one .",
    "this is because for such a high value of @xmath141 the main line becomes very optically thick and the observed emission originates in the outer ( and , therefore , colder ) regions of the core .    since the spacing between values of @xmath53 listed in table  [ tbl5 ] , that correspond to those given by schaller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , is too coarse , especially in the high mass range , we explored additional cases obtaining the relationship between @xmath53 and @xmath57 by interpolation of the tables of schaller et al . in this way",
    ", we performed a fine tuning of the mass of the central star and determined the range of values of the parameters that is consistent with the observational uncertainties of the data .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tbl5b ] . in summary , the dust continuum sed and the spatial variation of the ammonia spectra can be explained by a dense envelope with a central massive star of mass @xmath53 = 20 - 25 @xmath198 , undergoing an intense accretion at a rate @xmath52 = 2 - 3 @xmath199 , and with a total luminosity of @xmath200 .",
    "the mass of the envelope is @xmath201 = 1400 - 1800 @xmath198 and it has a considerable static region that surrounds the collapsing region .",
    "the value of the magnetic field is @xmath202 = 5 - 6 mg .",
    "the outermost region has a velocity dispersion of @xmath203 km s@xmath3 , dominated by turbulent motions .",
    "the temperature of the envelope ranges from @xmath5 k ( at @xmath204 au ) to @xmath67 k ( at @xmath205 = 130 - 160 au ) .",
    "the gas - phase ammonia abundance inside the envelope is described by a step - like function with a minimum value of 1 - 4 @xmath206 in the outer , colder ( @xmath207 k ) region , and 2 - 4 @xmath208 in the inner , hotter ( @xmath209 k ) region .",
    "this distribution of the gas - phase ammonia abundance results from the sublimation of ammonia molecules trapped in water ice grain mantles .",
    "the minimum and maximum values of the ammonia abundance are similar to the typical values reported in low and high mass protostellar cores , respectively .",
    "our results for g31 hmc can be compared with the calculations for this source made by other authors .",
    "cesaroni et al .",
    "( 1998 ) carried out an analysis of the nh@xmath18(4,4 ) main line assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium and that the line is optically thick .",
    "they claimed that the observed gradient in the peak brightness temperature is a good estimate of the radial distribution of the kinetic temperature of the gas inside the core .",
    "since the observed peak brightness temperature profile of g31 hmc does not coincide with the expected kinetic temperature profile of a sphere , these authors concluded that neither a collapsing nor an expanding spherical envelope can explain the properties of the observed emission .",
    "this conclusion was based on a large velocity gradient ( lvg ) hypothesis , that implies that for any line of sight with @xmath210 the only contribution to the peak brightness temperature ( at zero velocity relative to the ambient cloud ) arises from the plane perpendicular to the line of sight that contains the center of the core ( since the line - of - sight component of the infall velocity of this material is strictly zero ) . however ,",
    "if lines are broad ( as is the case in g31 hmc ) , the lvg hypothesis is not valid since material from outside this plane can also contribute to the emission at the center of the line .",
    "furthermore , if the envelope has a static region ( as suggested by our analysis ) the peak brightness temperature would have a significant contribution from the material in this static region .",
    "therefore , this analysis does not seem adequate to infer the radial temperature distribution in the envelope and , consequently , the possibility of a collapsing spherical envelope can not be discarded .",
    "cesaroni et al .",
    "( 1998 ) favored a geometrically thin disk seen almost face on ( therefore , with a single temperature for each line of sight ) to account for the g31 hmc nh@xmath18(4,4 ) emission .",
    "however , in order to reach a very high optical depth with such a geometrically thin disk a very high surface density would be required .",
    "this hypothesis was not tested by cesaroni et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and it is unclear if could correspond to a realistic scenario .",
    "also , the satellite lines were not considered in the analysis , and it is also unclear how the observed variation of the main line to satellites ratio as a function of impact parameter can be reproduced .",
    "therefore , we conclude that although we followed a simplified approach ( a spherically symmetric model with a single central source of luminosity ) , ignoring deviations from spherical symmetry produced either by rotation ( disks ) or due to the intrinsic elongation of the cloud , our model accounts for some of the basic observed properties of g31 hmc , especially the highest angular resolution line observations , and constitutes a step ahead in modeling these structures .      to further test our modeling , we calculated the emerging emission for ammonia transitions other than the ( 4,4 ) using the same sls model and ammonia abundances derived by fitting both the sed and the subarcsecond resolution ammonia ( 4,4 ) transition data ( table  [ tbl5b ] ) . unfortunately , for ammonia transitions other than the ( 4,4 ) only single - dish data ( churchwell et al . 1990 ,",
    "cesaroni et al . 1992 ) are available in the literature .",
    "these observations were obtained with the 100 m telescope , with an angular resolution of @xmath155 .",
    "therefore , a convolution of the model results with a gaussian with a fwhm=@xmath155 was performed . since this angular resolution is insufficient to resolve the emission of the core , only the spectra towards the @xmath173 position",
    "have been calculated .",

    "we show the model spectra for the ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , ( 4,4 ) , and ( 5,5 ) transitions overlaid on the spectra observed by churchwell et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and cesaroni et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . the uncertainty in the absolute calibration of the observed spectra is estimated to be about 30% ( churchwell et al .",
    "1990 , cesaroni et al .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , the model spectrum of the ( 4,4 ) line coincides pretty well ( within @xmath810% ) with the observed one . for the ( 2,2 ) and ( 5,5 ) lines , the brightness temperatures of the model spectra are @xmath211% lower than in the observed spectra , which is still within the calibration uncertainties .",
    "the ratio of intensities of the main to satellite lines , which is independent of the calibration , is @xmath212 for the observed ( 2,2 ) spectrum ( the uncertainty in the ratio is estimated from the rms of the spectrum ) , in agreement with the value of 3.9 obtained for the model spectrum .",
    "the ratio is @xmath213 for the observed ( 5,5 ) spectrum , which is also in agreement with the value of 3.5 obtained for the model spectrum .",
    "the observed line width ( fwhm ) of the ( 2,2 ) main line is @xmath214 km s@xmath3 , somewhat smaller than the value of @xmath215 km s@xmath3 obtained for the model spectrum .",
    "finally , the observed line width of the ( 5,5 ) main line is @xmath216 km s@xmath3 , which is very similar to the value of @xmath215 km s@xmath3 predicted by the model . given the coincidence of line ratios and line widths , and taking into account the uncertainty in the calibration , we consider that the model predictions are roughly consistent with the observations of the ( 2,2 ) , ( 4,4 ) , and ( 5,5 ) transitions .",
    "however , uncertainties in the calibration are large ( 30% ) and a definitive conclusion is difficult to attain with the present data . for the ammonia ( 1,1 ) line , the brightness temperature of the model spectrum is significantly lower than that of the observed spectrum , and the shape of the spectrum is also different .",
    "we believe that for the ammonia ( 1,1 ) transition , that traces the colder gas , there is likely a significant contribution of cold molecular gas from outside the core ( see hatchell et al .",
    "2000 ) , which is not considered in our modeling .",
    "also , the assumption @xmath129=@xmath65 used in deriving our ammonia spectra could affect these results .",
    "we conclude that our model parameters , obtained by fitting the dust and high angular resolution nh@xmath18(4,4 ) transition data , can also reproduce , within the observational uncertainties , the intensities , line profiles , and main to satellite line ratios of the multitransitional ammonia data .",
    "our modeling is carried out by fitting essentially four parameters , namely , the mass accretion rate and the mass of the central star ( or , alternatively , the stellar luminosity ) in a physically self - consistent collapse model of a sls envelope , and the minimum and maximum gas - phase ammonia abundances inside this envelope .",
    "we conclude therefore that in massive protostars , where an important temperature gradient is expected to be present , an analysis in terms of a realistic , self - consistent model that takes into account the gradients in the physical properties inside the core is necessary to properly interpret the observational data .",
    "the modeling we carried out for g31 hmc , including the continuum sed as well as the high angular resolution properties of the molecular emission , is , to our knowledge , one of the more complete ever made for a hot molecular core .",
    "this source appears to be a good laboratory to test the very early stages of massive star formation .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .   we have succeeded in developing a self - consistent model of the physical structure of a hot core , described as a spherically symmetric sls envelope infalling onto a massive star .",
    "the model predicts the continuum emission sed as well as the shape and intensity of ammonia lines . 2 .",
    "this model is able to reproduce the general observed properties of g31 hmc .",
    "in addition to the sed , it can reproduce the strong intensity of the main and satellite ammonia ( 4,4 ) lines , as well as their spatial variations as observed with subarcsecond angular resolution .",
    "the same model can roughly reproduce , within the observational uncertainties , the single - dish ammonia ( 2,2 ) , ( 4,4 ) , and ( 5,5 ) data .",
    "the ammonia ( 1,1 ) data likely have a significant contribution of cold gas outside the core that has not been included in the model .",
    "although the sed fitting alone can not constrain adequately the parameters of g31 hmc , the simultaneous fitting of the sed and the ammonia emission allows us to obtain a preliminary estimate of the physical parameters of this source . our best fit model for g31 hmc",

    "+ a steep increase of the gas - phase ammonia abundance , from @xmath221 in the outer parts of the envelope to @xmath222 in the inner parts , is required to reproduce the observed spatial variations of the high angular resolution ammonia spectra .",
