    "nonequilibrium formulations of field theories are in a stage of development at present .",
    "their study is essential for ultimately constructing a solid theoretical basis for the transport codes that are used according to various models for the simulation of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "one such attempt that is still in its early stages investigates the nonequilibrium formulation of a _ chiral _ theory , the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite . from practical experience",
    ", one assumes that a collision term of the associated semi - classical limit will be boltzmann - like in form , and this has been demonstrated explicitly @xcite .",
    "in particular , a full calculation that includes mesonic degrees of freedom must also contain not only quark - quark and quark - antiquark scattering cross - sections on the partonic level , but also the hadronization processes @xmath9 and their dissolution , where @xmath10 represents a mesonic state .",
    "cross - sections for these processes in su(3 ) have already been calculated and are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "processes such as those described in the last paragraph are binary in nature . on the other hand ,",
    "there are numerous other processes that may occur and which increase the total number of particles .",
    "while binary collisions lead to thermal equilibrium , other multiparticle collisions may also be required to attain chemical equilibrium .",
    "in particular , the simplest possible further kind of collision would be one that increases the number of particles , such as that of @xmath11 .",
    "such a process should also rightly enter into the collision dynamics .",
    "if one had some knowledge of the magnitude of such processes , one would at least know whether multiparticle production in transport models could be expected to play an important role or not .",
    "in particular , one imagines that multiparticle hadronization processes such as the type just mentioned could be particularly important for the goldstone bosons , the pions , since they are massless in the chiral limit , and are light in any event .",
    "since pions are the dominant degree of freedom in the late phase of heavy - ion collisions , being produced copiously , it is essential to study their role .",
    "the purpose of this paper is thus to examine the cross - section for processes of the kind @xmath12 , where two particles enter the interaction region , while three are emitted .",
    "a direct numerical calculation is performed specifically for the case @xmath13 .",
    "this specific example has been chosen because the hadronization channel into two mesons @xmath14 has already been calculated and has been shown to dominate over the other possible existing two pseudoscalar emission channels that include @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the chiral model underpinning our calculation is the njl model , in which the su(2 ) version is used .",
    "while this model has several shortcomings , specifically that it does not confine , it gives an excellent description of the mesonic and baryonic sectors @xcite . in using this model ,",
    "one is able to obtain a self - consistent description within a chiral theory , which ultimately may be used in developing a self - consistent transport theory that in turn is based purely on this chiral lagrangian @xcite .    as a guide to determining the most relevant diagrams , the expansion in the inverse number of colors @xmath2",
    "is used @xcite . within the same order of @xmath2 ,",
    "there are three types of diagrams , an @xmath3-like , a @xmath4-like , and a mixed so - called @xmath5-like graph .",
    "we find expressions for the invariant amplitudes in all three cases , and apply this to a calculation of the transition rates specifically for the process @xmath7 .",
    "since there are many terms that contribute to each channel , we investigate all channels first separately , and find that the @xmath5-like channel is at least an order of magnitude larger than the @xmath3-like and @xmath4-like graphs .",
    "that is to say , within the @xmath2 ordering , there appears to be a subordering that dictates that one ( or more ) graphs are in fact dominant .",
    "in retrospect , one can give _ heuristic _",
    "arguments why the particular @xmath5-like graph should in fact dominate .",
    "this particular graph contains the most divergent functions , since it contains a fermion loop with three propagators .",
    "the @xmath3-like graph by contrast contains a fermion loop with four propagators .",
    "in fact , such an ordering of terms within one specific class of diagrams that superficially are all of the same order in @xmath2 _ rather _ according to the degree of divergence of each graph was proposed long ago in ref.@xcite .",
    "the calculation in this paper thus serves also in part to validate _ a posteriori _ that this ordering correctly assesses the importance of each term . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "convergent terms were regarded as being secondary , while the leading behavior was determined solely by the divergent terms . in a further calculation of the pion radius @xcite",
    ", it has also been seen that the leading logarithmic contribution that is in accord with the well - known results of sigma models and chiral perturbation theory , is also due to the most divergent graph of the many available to the same order in the @xmath2 expansion when calculated in the njl model .",
    "this is so because this graph naturally corresponds to the pion loop diagram that has been known to give rise to the chiral logarithm in so many other models or theories , see for example refs .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , no explicit calculations of the remaining terms was undertaken .    in our numerical calculation of the transition rate that was carried out using a monte carlo procedure",
    ", we find that the @xmath5-like channel has the same order of magnitude for the production rate of @xmath18 as is found for the dominant two particle production rate @xmath19 @xcite . as such",
    ", it appears to give a nonnegligible contribution to the production cross - section for three pions and can not be ignored in hadronization programs at low energies .",
    "an essential feature of the calculation is the construction of the cross - section for the process of two incoming to three outgoing states , @xmath20 . to this end , we introduce extended mandelstam - like variables that will be denoted as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and we reexpress the cross - section in terms of these variables .",

    "2 are generic : the full set of diagrams is obtained for figs .",

    "the single emanating meson line can also take on any of the final state momenta , leading to a further permutation of these three possibilities .",
    "exact combinations again depend on the flavors of the vertices in question .    for two incoming states to three outgoing states ,",
    "it is useful to define the extended mandelstam - like variables , @xmath48 where the last relations follow from energy - momentum conservation , @xmath49 . using , in addition , the restriction to quarks for the incoming states , @xmath50 and pions for the outgoing states , @xmath51 we find @xmath52 and @xmath53 in analogy to eq.([e : sum ] ) .    in what follows , in our analysis of the @xmath3-like and @xmath4-like graphs , the products @xmath54 , @xmath55 and so forth , occur .",
    "these are simply related to the extended mandelstam variables via , e.g. , @xmath56 we do not explicitly rewrite our expressions in terms of these variables : the numerical program makes a direct translation .",
    "in contrast to this , the @xmath4-like channel amplitudes are most simply written directly in terms of these variables and we thus use them explicitly from the start .      in this section , we discuss the @xmath3-like channel diagram involving an intermediate scalar or pseudoscalar meson .",
    "one of the six possible ways of distributing the momenta is shown in fig .",
    "we shall assume that the final state always contains three pseudoscalar particles .",
    "in this case , if the intermediate meson is a scalar , the scattering amplitude , vanishes , @xmath57 this must be so on general grounds , since the parity of the final state is negative , in contrast to the positive parity of the intermediate state . this can also be validated by direct calculation .",

    "our numerical calculations are based on a monte carlo procedure for evaluating the fourfold integral in the expression eq.([e : lastsig ] ) for the cross section . in implementing this ,",
    "it proves useful to alter the integration region .",
    "as already mentioned , this consists of surfaces @xmath224 and @xmath228 in the @xmath212-@xmath213 and @xmath241-@xmath61 plane respectively and is bounded by the further condition eq.([6a ] ) .",

    "this has the advantage that random points can be chosen to be equally distributed in this triangular area for the monte carlo procedure . on actually performing the numerical integration , the caveat",
    "is imposed that the function to be integrated takes the required functional value in @xmath244 , @xmath228 but which is zero otherwise , together with the restriction eq.([6a ] ) .",
    "the delineation of the integration regions for @xmath212 and @xmath213 is given via @xmath245 with @xmath246 and @xmath247 .    in order to evaluate the transition rate , the individual contributions to @xmath248 that occur in eq.([mtotal ] )",
    "must be specified .",
    "these are in turn dictated by the traces of the flavor factors , which sometimes vanish . for the specific combination of @xmath249 in the final state ,",
    "the @xmath3-like channel contribution contains all six possible graphs , @xmath250 while in the @xmath4-like channel , only three possible graphs contribute , @xmath251 in the @xmath5-like channel , there are only four possibilities . here",
    "the single outgoing meson must be a @xmath252 , while the loop contains the @xmath253 and @xmath254 outgoing in the final state .",
    "the two loop directions plus the attachment to either the incoming quark or antiquark line comprise these possibilites . they are fully summarized in the function @xmath255 rather than evaluate the complete transition rate that is constructed from @xmath256 ,",
    "we evaluate first the transition rate in each particular channel , in order to illustrate the magnitude that each type of channel contributes .",
    "we comment briefly on our numerical procedure . in the @xmath3-like channel",
    ", the pseudoscalar polarization function @xmath78 is required from eq.([e : mpi ] ) , while for the @xmath5-like channel , the scalar polarization function @xmath257 enters as in eq.([e : v2calc ] ) , corresponding to the exchange of @xmath258 or @xmath103 mesons respectively . at zero temperature , the case studied here , one has that at @xmath259 , the @xmath258 is strongly bound , while at @xmath260 , the @xmath103 is weakly unbound , since @xmath261",
    ". thus the @xmath103 already has a small width , representing the unphysical decay into two quarks . at higher values of @xmath262 , this unphysical width grows , and at large values of @xmath262 , the pion can also develop a width . we have chosen to ignore such unphysical decays into quark constituents .",
    "this is done primarily for reasons of numerical simplicity  only the principle values of the integrals @xmath70 that enter into @xmath78 and @xmath257 are considered  and this allows one to focus on the role of the triangular vertex graphs , which are the physical cause of the decays into the mesons .",
    "this procedure simply assumes that the intermediate mesonic states are stable with regard to decay into their quark constituents , which is not unreasonable .",
    "note that the imaginary parts of the @xmath70 that enter into the irreducible polarization functions commence always at the threshold @xmath263 .",
    "a detailed discussion of these functions giving their analytic structure , together with graphic illustrations as a function of @xmath264 and @xmath265 can be found in ref.@xcite .    for our numerical results , the parameters @xmath266 mev , @xmath267 , and @xmath268 mev have been used .",
    "these lead to the values @xmath269 mev , @xmath270 mev and @xmath271 mev@xmath272 .",
    "calculated values of the quark mass yield @xmath273 mev and the pion quark coupling as being @xmath274 .",
    "figures 9,10 , and 11 display the results for the @xmath3-like , @xmath4-like , and @xmath5-like channels individually .",
    "one sees that the @xmath5-like channel provides the largest yield , being substantially larger than the @xmath3-like channel ( an order of magnitude ) and the @xmath4-like channel ( two orders of magnitude ) .",
    "thus , one sees that within the set of graphs that are of the same order in the @xmath2 expansion in fact have a very different relevance .",
    "it is important to try to understand this , and we can do so on a heuristic level : one notes that both the @xmath3 and @xmath5 like channels contain a quark loop .",
    "the fewer the number of quark lines occurring in this loop , the more divergent , or less convergent this diagram will be .",
    "graphs such as that occurring for the @xmath3-like channel contain a quark loop with four internal quark lines in contrast to the graphs of the @xmath5-like channel , which has a quark loop with three internal quark lines .",
    "one may thus expect that the @xmath5-like channel will dominate over the @xmath3 channel .",
    "our findings and this argument are in line with that of ref.@xcite , in which all convergent terms are dropped and only the leading divergent or least convergent ones are retained .",
    "a similar argument was given in ref.@xcite for ignoring several @xmath275 terms in the higher order corrections to the pion radius , in which the same argument was made on heuristic grounds .",
    "this numerical calculation now validates such heuristic claims .",
    "thus this ordering plays an additional role in reordering the set of terms that occur beyond the @xmath2 expansion .    obviously , by examining the graphs of figs .  9 to 11 ,",
    "the full cross - section should be well approximated by that of the @xmath5-channel alone .",
    "this is given in fig .",
    "12 , and includes the cross terms .",
    "we also compare our result with the transition rates for the processes @xmath276 and @xmath277 that proceed via the diagrams of fig .  1 . here",
    "the process @xmath278 is the dominant one .",
    "we find , for the range of validity of the model , say @xmath279gev , that the hadronization rate of @xmath28 and @xmath280 into three pions , which is also driven by a two pion hadronization graph , is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath281 into two pions , despite the fact that the phase space is altered .",
    "this result indicates that transport or other models that include hadronization as a two meson level , require hadronization into at least three pions also .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the three meson hadronization process @xmath11 within the two flavor nambu  jona - lasinio model .",
    "our motivation stems from the fact that pions are light , almost massless particles and can thus be produced copiously .",
    "we have calculated transition rates for this process in order to assess the importance of this process in comparison with the standard binary processes that are usually input into transport models . since the njl model is currently under study as a transport model for a chiral theory @xcite ,",
    "such questions can be answered within the context of the model itself .",
    "it has thus been our aim to investigate the transition rate for this process , in comparison with similar transition rates for two meson production @xmath282 for a specific initial state @xmath283 and @xmath284 being @xmath28 and @xmath280 .    in our analytic discussion",
    ", we have found that there are three types of diagrams that contribute in the lowest level @xmath2 expansion that is appropriate to this model .",
    "our numerical calculation however indicates that an additional criterion for deciding on which graphs dominate the set of diagrams in a particular @xmath2 class is the number of internal fermion lines when a fermion loop diagram is present .",
    "this criterion is in accord with the heuristic methods of ref.@xcite , and which was used successfully in identifying the logarithmic contribution to the pion radius @xcite , and thereby recovering the known results of sigma models , other chiral models and chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) for this quantity .",
    "we have thus explicitly been able in this paper , to demonstrate that this crucial heuristic argument given in @xcite is in fact valid , in particular in the context of a different calculation . in view of the fact that the dominance of the most divergent graph gives the expected result for the pion radius ,",
    "our result here may not simply be a model artifact .",
    "we have at present no way of knowing how this result would compare with that calculated within another framework , say a confinement model @xcite or within qcd itself , where the mechanism giving rise to the leading term may be different .",
    "we avoid any speculation here .",
    "we conclude by stating that the numerical calculation shows that our results lie within the same order of magnitude as the hadronization rates for two pions , thereby indicating that such processes must necessarily be taken into account in hadronization at low energies .",
