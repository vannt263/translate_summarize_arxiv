    "the use of inexpensive and densely deployed rrhs , along with the advanced joint processing mechanism , could significantly improve upon the current 4 g system with enhanced scalability , increased throughput and extended coverage .",

    "based c - ran , all mobile users in the same cluster transmit on the same spectrum and at the same time , while the bbu performs multi - user detection ( mud ) to separate the user messages . in practice , however , the implementation of mud is hurdled by the high computational complexity and the difficulty in signal synchronization as well as perfect channel estimation .",
    "similarly , the downlink communication using sdma is also of high complexity in the encoding design to mitigate the co - channel interference . with",
    "this regard , orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) is an alternative candidate for c - ran because of its efficient spectral usage and yet low encoding / decoding complexity . in ofdma - based c - ran systems , users are allocated with orthogonal subcarriers ( scs ) free of co - channel interference . in this case ,",
    "simple maximal - ratio combining ( mrc ) technique could be performed at the cu over the signals received from different rrhs to decode a user s message transmitted on its designated sc .",
    "moreover , ofdma is compatible with the current wireless communication systems such as 4 g lte .",
    "considering its potential implementations in future wireless systems and compatibility with the current 4 g standards , we consider ofdma for the cluster - based c - ran ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) in this paper .",
    "the performance of a c - ran system is constrained by the fronthaul link capacity . with densely deployed rrhs ,",
    "the fronthaul traffic generated from a single user signal of mhz bandwidth could be easily scaled up to multiple gbps @xcite . in practice , a commercial fiber link with tens of gbps capacity could thus be easily overwhelmed even under moderate mobile traffic . to tackle this problem , many signal compression / quantization methods",
    "have been proposed to optimize the system performance under fronthaul capacity constraints .",
    "specifically , the so - called `` quantize - and - forward '' scheme is widely adopted for the uplink communication in c - ran to reduce the communication rates between the bbu and rrhs @xcite@xcite , where each rrh samples , quantizes and forwards its received signals to the bbu over its fronthaul link .",
    "the quantize - and - forward scheme is initially studied in relay channel as an efficient way for the relay to deliver the received signal from the source to the destination @xcite . in the uplink communication of c - ran , which can be viewed as a special case of relay channel model with a wireless first - hop link and wired ( fiber ) second - hop link ,",
    "quantize - and - forward scheme is studied under an information - theoretical gaussian test channel model with the uncompressed signals as the input and compressed signals as the output corrupted by an additive gaussian compression noise .",
    "then , the quantization methods are designed through setting the quantization noise levels at different rrhs to maximize the end - to - end throughput subject to the capacity constraints of individual fronthaul links .",
    "specifically , the optimal quantization design needs to consider the signal correlation across the multiple rrhs , where methods based on distributed source coding , e.g. , wyner - ziv coding , are widely used to jointly optimize the noise levels at the rrhs ( see e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "besides , quantization method based on distributed source coding is also studied in the downlink communication of c - ran in @xcite .    despite of their respective contributions to the understanding of the theoretical limits of c - ran , most of the proposed quantization methods are based on information - theoretical models , e.g. , gaussian test channel and distributed source coding , which are practically hard to implement . on one hand , although the quantization noise levels across different rrhs that maximize the end - to - end throughput are found in @xcite@xcite under different system setups , it is still unknown how to practically design quantization codebook at each rrh to achieve the required quantization noise level for the gaussian test channel model . on the other hand ,",
    "the decompression complexity of distributed source coding grows exponentially with the number of sources ( e.g. , rrhs in the uplink communication ) . in practice",
    ", the complexity can be prohibitively high in a c - ran with a large number of cooperating rrhs . therefore",
    ", it still remains as a question about the practically achievable throughput of c - ran using practical quantization methods , such as uniform scalar or vector quantization used in common a / d modules @xcite , which are independently applied over rrhs .",
    "furthermore , most of the existing works ( e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) only study signal compression methods in c - ran under fixed wireless resource allocation .",
    "however , the end - to - end performance of c - ran is determined by both the wireless and fronthaul links . in an ofdma system ,",
    "transmit power allocation over frequency scs directly determines the spectral efficiency of wireless link .",
    "for an ofdma - based system without fronthaul constraint , the optimal power allocation problem is extensively studied , e.g. , it follows the celebrated water - filling policy for a single user case @xcite .",
    "however , the behavior of optimal sc power allocation in a fronthaul constrained system like c - ran is still unknown to the authors best knowledge .      in this paper",
    ", we address the above problems in an ofdma - based c - ran .",
    "in particular , we consider using simple uniform scalar quantization instead of the information - theoretical quantization method based on gaussian test channel , and propose joint wireless power control and fronthaul rate allocation design to maximize the system throughput performance .",
    "our main contributions are summarized as follows :    * in the uplink communication of an ofdma - based c - ran , we derive the end - to - end sum - rate of all the users subject to each rrh s fronthaul capacity constraint achieved by a simple uniform scalar quantization at each rrh together with independent compression among rrhs .",
    "different from prior works based on gaussian test channel model , this provides for the first time an achievable rate result for c - ran with a practically implementable quantization method . * with the derived rate under uniform scalar quantization , we formulate the optimization problem of joint wireless power control and fronthaul rate allocation to maximize the sum - rate performance in ofdma based c - ran .",
    "we also formulate the problem based on the gaussian test channel model to obtain performance benchmark .",
    "efficient algorithms are proposed to solve the formulated joint optimization problems based on the alternating optimization technique .",
    "* by investigating the single - user and single - rrh special case , we obtain important insights on the optimal wireless power control and fronthaul rate allocation over scs .",
    "for example , with a fixed fronthaul rate allocation , we show that the optimal power allocation over scs is a threshold based policy depending on the channel power of a sc , i.e. , no power is allocated to a sc if the channel power is below the threshold .",
    "interestingly , we find that the power allocation under fronthaul rate constraint in general does not follow a water - filling policy that always allocates more power to sc with higher channel power .",
    "the inconsistency is especially evident in low - fronthaul - rate region , where the sc with the highest channel power may receive the least transmit power , and vice versa .",
    "we also theoretically quantify the performance gap between the proposed simple uniform quantization scheme from the throughput upper ( cut - set ) bound . by simulations",
    "we show that the throughput performance of the simple uniform quantization scheme is very close to the performance upper bound , and in fact overlaps with the upper bound when the fronthaul capacity is sufficiently large .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first introduce in sections [ sec : system model ] and [ sec : two scalar quantization models ] the system model of c - ran and the quantization techniques used in the fronthaul signal processing , respectively . in section [ sec : problem formulation ] , we formulate the end - to - end sum - rate maximization problems for both the gaussian test channel and uniform scalar quantization models .",
    "sections [ sec : special case : single user and single rrh ] and [ sec : general case : multiple users and multiple rrhs ] solve the formulated problems for the special case of single - user and single - rrh and general case of multi - user and multi - rrh , respectively . finally , we conclude the paper and point out some directions for future work in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider the uplink of a clustered c - ran . as shown in fig . [ fig1 ] , each cluster consists of one bbu , @xmath0 single - antenna rrhs , denoted by the set @xmath1 , and @xmath2 single - antenna users , denoted by the set @xmath3 .",
    "it is assumed that each rrh @xmath4 , @xmath5 , is connected to the bbu through a noiseless wired fronthaul link of capacity @xmath6 bps . in the uplink ,",
    "each rrh receives user signals over the wireless link and forwards to the bbu via its fronthaul link .",
    "then , the bbu jointly decodes the users messages based on the signals from all the rrhs within the cluster and forwards the decoded information to the core network through a backhaul link .",
    "the detailed signal models in the wireless and the fronthaul links are introduced in the following .      in this paper",

    ", dynamic sc allocation could be used to enhance the spectral efficiency by assigning scs to users of favorable wireless link conditions , e.g. , allocating a sc to the user with the highest signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) . however , as an initial attempt to understand the joint design of the wireless resource allocation and fronthaul rate allocation in fronthaul constrained c - ran , it is assumed for simplicity in this paper that the sc allocations among users , i.e. , @xmath11 s , are pre - determined .",
    "the interesting case with dynamic sc allocation is left for future study .",

    "note that @xmath25 s are independent over @xmath16 due to scalar quantization at each sc , and over @xmath4 due to independent compression among rrhs .",
    "then , each rrh transforms the parallel encoded bits @xmath27 s into the serial ones and sends them to the bbu via its fronthaul link for joint information decoding .",
    "after collecting the digital codewords , the bbu first recovers the baseband quantized symbols @xmath28 s based on the quantization codebooks used by each rrh .",
