    "although strong and electromagnetic decays of @xmath0 have been extensively studied for several decades , both experimental and theoretical investigations of weak decays of @xmath0 are much behind . due to smallness of the strength of weak interaction ,",
    "the weak decays of the @xmath0 are rare processes .",
    "sanchis - lonzano suggested to search for these rare decays whose sum of branching ratios were estimated to be at the order of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "such processes hardly drew much attention because the database was far from reaching such accuracy .",
    "thus , for a long time , few further researches on this topic were done .",
    "thanks to the progress of accelerator and detector techniques , more accurate measurements may be carried out , thus the interest on weak decays of @xmath0 has been revived .",
    "the bes collaboration indeed starts to measure some rare weak decays of @xmath0 and eventually sets an upper bound on the branching ratio of @xmath5 at order of @xmath6 by using @xmath7 @xmath0 database @xcite .",
    "the forthcoming upgraded besiii can accumulate @xmath8 @xmath0 per year @xcite , which makes it marginally possible to measure such weak decays of @xmath0 , at least one may expect to observe not - null such events .",
    "thus , more careful theoretical investigation on these decays seems necessary .",
    "indeed , the weak decays of heavy quarkonium like @xmath0 offer an ideal opportunity of studying non - perturbative qcd effects , because such systems contain two heavy constituents of the same flavor .",
    "the situation is quite different from that for heavy mesons which contain only one heavy constituent , and the non - perturbative effects might be attributed to the light flavor , thus the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) applies .",
    "moreover , for the weak decay of a vector meson , the polarization effect may play a role to probe the underlying dynamics and hadron structure @xcite .",
    "the weak decay of @xmath0 is realized via the spectator mechanism that the charm quark ( antiquark ) decays and the antiquark ( quark ) acts as a spectator .",
    "the characteristic of the decay modes is that the final state contains a single charmed hadron .",
    "the theory of weak interactions has been thoroughly investigated and the effective hamiltonian at the quark level is perfectly formulated .",
    "the main job of calculating the rates of the semi - leptonic decays of @xmath0 is to properly evaluate the hadronic matrix elements for @xmath9 , namely the transition form factors which are obviously governed by non - perturbative qcd effects .",
    "the main aim of this work is to calculate the @xmath10 form factors in the qcd sum rules .",
    "the weak decay of heavy quarkonium has been studied by virtue of heavy quark spin symmetry @xcite . in that framework , the transition form factors of a heavy quarkonium to heavy pseudoscalar and vector mesons are parameterized by a universal function @xmath11 in analog to the isgur - wise function for the heavy meson transitions .",
    "however , the non - recoil approximation @xmath12 was used in ref.@xcite , which would bring up uncontrollable uncertainties to the estimation of decay widths .",
    "it seems helpful to re - investigate these processes based on a more rigorous theoretical framework .",
    "motivated by the arguments , in this work we will calculate the form factors for heavy quarkonium @xmath0 decays into a pseudoscalar or vector meson in the qcd sum rules .    as a matter of fact , many authors have tried to evaluate the transition form factors for the heavy meson and quarkonium system in various approaches , such as the simple quark model @xcite , light - front approach @xcite , the qcd sum rules @xcite , the perturbative qcd approach @xcite and etc .",
    "the qcd sum - rule approach , which is rooted in the quantum field theory and fully relativistic , is considered to be one of the effective tools for analyzing hadronic processes @xcite . besides evaluation of hadron spectra",
    ", the qcd sum - rule technique has been applied to calculate the pion electromagnetic form factor at intermediate momentum transfer @xcite , various weak decay channels @xcite , the coupling constant of the strong interaction @xcite and even to determine the light cone distribution amplitudes of hadrons @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this method is that the non - perturbative qcd effects are included in a few parameters such as the quark- and gluon - condensates which have evident physical meaning @xcite .",
    "after this introduction , we will firstly display the effective hamiltonian relevant to the semi - leptonic decays of @xmath0 to @xmath13 , and the sum rules for form factors in section [ the standard procedure ] .",
    "the wilson coefficients of various operators which manifest the perturbative qcd effects are also calculated in this section with the help of operator product expansion ( ope ) technique .",
    "the numerical analysis on the form factors are performed in section [ numerical results ] .",
    "the decay rates of semi - leptonic decay @xmath14 and a comparison of our results with that obtained based on other approaches are presented in section [ decay rate ] . in the last section",
    "we draw our conclusion .",
    "for the semi - leptonic decays @xmath16 , the effective weak hamiltonian is given by @xmath17        in this subsection , we calculate transition form factors of @xmath23 in the qcd sum rules . here",
    "we present the formulations for @xmath24 transition explicitly , while the expressions for @xmath25 can be obtained by simple replacements of @xmath26 and @xmath27 quark to @xmath28 quark .      following the standard procedure of the qcd sum rules @xcite ,",
    "we write the three - point correlation function for @xmath0 to @xmath30 as @xmath31 where the current @xmath32 represents the @xmath0 channel ; @xmath33 is the weak current and @xmath34 corresponds to the @xmath35 channel . in terms of the following definitions , @xmath36 we can insert a complete set of hadronic states with the quantum numbers the same as @xmath0 and @xmath37 to achieve the hadronic representation of the correlator ( [ correlator pseudoscalar ] ) @xmath38 obviously the concerned lowest hadronic states are @xmath0 and @xmath39 , while the terms with `` higher states '' represent contributions coming from higher excited states and continuum . using the double dispersion relation , the contributions of excited states and continuum can be expressed as @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the integration region in the @xmath42 plane .",

    "our predictions are much below the present experimental upper bounds @xcite : @xmath84 , @xmath85 .    a few remarks are presented in order .",
    "firstly , the sum of the branching fractions of semi - leptonic decays of @xmath0 whose final state includes @xmath86 , @xmath56 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 and their charge conjugate channels can reach as large as @xmath89 , which is expected to be marginally observed at besiii .",
    "secondly , it is worthwhile to point out that the decay rates for the dominant semi - leptonic weak decays of @xmath0 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite were about @xmath90 , which are two times greater than that calculated in this work .",
    "this discrepancy can attribute to the heavy quark spin symmetry and the non - recoil approximation used in ref .",
    "@xcite , also to the different methods used to estimate the non - perturbative form factors . , while we adopt the qcd sum rules to calculate the form factors in this work . ]",
    "thirdly , the ratio of @xmath91 is about 2 times larger than the value calculated in @xcite , where the assumption of heavy quark spin symmetry and non - recoil approximation were adopted .",
    "forth , the ratios @xmath92 and @xmath93 should be equal to @xmath94 under the su(3 ) flavor symmetry limit .",
    "our numerical calculations show that @xmath95 and @xmath96 , which implies large effect of su(3 ) symmetry breaking .",
    "the charmonium @xmath0 meson can decay via the strong and electromagnetic interactions , thus weak decays of @xmath0 should be very rare unless there is new physics beyond the standard model to make a substantial contribution .",
    "if such weak decays can be measured by the future experiments with sizable branching ratios , it would be a clear signal for new physics .    to make the new physics signal clearly distinguishable from the standard model , a careful study of weak decays in sm",
    "is needed . in this work , we calculated the form factors of weak transitions of @xmath97 in terms of the qcd sum rules . with the form factors , we estimate the branching ratios of the semileptonic weak decays of @xmath0 and find that the sum of the branching ratios corresponding to the dominant modes is about @xmath98 which may be marginally measured by bes iii .",
    "the qcd sum rules approach possesses uncontrollable errors as large as 20 to 30% , was confirmed by our numerical results .",
    "moreover , due to a coulomb - type correction in heavy quarkonium decay ( or @xmath99 ) , which may manifest as the ladder structure in the loop - triangle ( as a part of multi - loop diagrams ) , the spectral function needs to be multiplied by a finite renormalization factor @xcite . this would bring up another kind of uncertainty .",
    "it is expected that this kind of correction can give birth to the twice multiplication of the form factors at the maximal momentum transfer . however , in this work , we calculate both the three - point qcd sum rules of the weak transition form factors and the two - point sum rules for the decay constant of @xmath0 to the same order of @xmath100 . then , it is expected that most uncertainties due to the coulomb - like corrections are canceled in our calculations ; therefore , the coulomb - like corrections for the @xmath0 channel are not included in our calculations . as for the heavy - light mesons , there are no corrections in the power of inverse velocity for it , since the light quark moves relativistically .",
    "therefore , one should explore the sum rules for both three - point and two - point correlation functions up to next - to - leading order in strong coupling constant so that coulomb - like corrections to the heavy - light mesons can be canceled effectively .",
    "moreover , an explicit calculation of coulomb - like corrections to the heavy - light vertex in triangle diagram is still not available now , which can be left for further considerations .",
    "one can trust the numerical results to a certain accuracy , at least the order of magnitude is reliable . with these form factors",
    "we may continue to estimate the rates of non - leptonic weak decays of @xmath0 as long as the factorization theorem is proved",
    ". that would be the contents of our next work @xcite .",
    "the branching ratios of semi - leptonic weak decays of @xmath0 are very small in sm , even though their strong decay modes are ozi - suppressed .",
    "our numerical results indicate that even with a large database which will be collected by the bes iii , such weak decay modes may only be marginally observed .",
    "therefore we lay our expectation on our bes iii colleagues and hope them to provide sufficiently large database to make this challengeable field more fruitful .",
