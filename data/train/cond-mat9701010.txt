    "the fact that at zero temperature the quantum hall transitions are infinitely narrow complicates strongly their theoretical description even without electron  electron interactions . by now , in theory , the quantitaive information about the localization of two  dimensional electronic states in a magnetic field was obtained exclusively from numerical simulations .",
    "these simulations are carried out in one of two limits :    _ i _ ) short  range disorder    the results obtained before 1995 are reviewed in refs . and .",
    "different approaches employed : the recursive green s function method@xcite , evolution of the number of states with non  zero chern numbers with the sample size@xcite , and finite ",
    "size scaling analysis of the thouless number@xcite give consistent results for the critical exponent , @xmath0 , of the localization length .",
    "direct calculations of the conductance at the transition@xcite show that it is close to @xmath1 .",
    "recent developments include the study of the role of spin ",
    "orbit scattering@xcite for spin  degenerate electrons , localization in double@xcite and multilayer systems@xcite , statistics of energy levels at the transition@xcite and fractal properties of eigenstates at higher landau levels@xcite .    _ ii _ ) smooth disorder    all the simulations@xcite were performed in the frame of the network model introduced by chalker and coddington@xcite .",
    "the questions addressed were essentially the same as in the case of the short  range disorder .",
    "in addition calculating @xmath0,@xcite the network model was used to investigate the spin  degenerate case@xcite , and the effect of landau level mixing on the positions of delocalized states@xcite .",
    "it was also used to demonstrate that this mixing does not change the universality class of the transition@xcite , to relate the longitudinal and transverse conductivities in the transition region@xcite and to trace the smearing of a single delocalized state into a metallic band in a superlattice@xcite .",
    "recent works@xcite explored the correspondence between the network model and certain limits of the models that were already studied ( spin chains@xcite , hubbard chains@xcite and dirac fermions@xcite ) .",
    "in the recent experimental paper by cobden and kogan@xcite the observation of strong and reproducible conductance fluctuations of a mesoscopic sample right at the transition was reported .",
    "this observation was also accounted for in the frame of the network model in refs . and .",
    "the result of simulations@xcite closely resemble the histogram of the conductance fluctuations in@xcite . in ref .",
    "the calculated central moments of the conductance distribution were extrapolated to large sample sizes , where it becomes universal .    the network model@xcite is illustrated in fig .",
    "if a disorder is smooth , classical electron drifts along equipotentials , which are closed and disconnected except for the percolation threshold . for simplicity",
    "it was assumed that at any energy equipotentials are arranged periodically .",
    "quantum mechanics is introduced by allowing a strong tunnel coupling between the orbits when they come close enough ( @xmath2 or closer than the magnetic length ) .",
    "this destroys the classical localization and makes important the interference of different directed paths .",
    "randomness is introduced by assuming the magnetic phases , acquired in course of drift along equipotentials , to be random .",
    "if a smooth potential is symmetric with respect to zero energy , then the classical percolation threshold is also at @xmath3 .",
    "although this is obvious , we would like to derive the same conclusion following a different line of arguments .    the centers of closed drift trajectories in fig .",
    "1 form a square lattice .",
    "classical electron switches to another trajectory , centered at a neighboring lattice site , if its energy , @xmath4 , exceeds the height , @xmath5 , of a saddle  point separating these sites .",
    "one can say that in this case a _ bond _ between two sites _ connects _ them . in the opposite case , @xmath6",
    ", the electron retains its orbit after passing the saddle  point",
    ". then one can say that the corresponding bond is removed .",
    "thus we arrive at the bond percolation problem on the square lattice .",
    "suppose now , that the electron energy , which was initially at the lowest minimum , gradually increases .",
    "as it happens , more and more bonds switch on .",
    "percolation occurs when some critical portion of bonds connect .",
    "it is an exact result of the percolation theory@xcite that for the square lattice this portion is @xmath7 , which corresponds to zero energy .",
    "the fact that the classical picture can be reformulated as a percolation problem on a lattice suggests the following possibilty .",
    "it is known that the critical exponent for classical percolation can be found with high accuracy from a simple renormalization group ( rg ) calculation .",
    "in course of this calculation only a small cluster is considered .",
    "if a similar approach could be devised for the quantum percolation , it would provide an approximate description of the quantum hall transition in the closed form .",
    "in contrast to the classical renormalization scheme , such an approach should deal not with `` connecting '' or `` removed '' bonds , but characterize each bond by some scattering matrix .",
    "it should also allow for interference of different directed paths within a cluster .",
    "this program is carried out in the present paper .",
    "we utilize a real  space rg scheme for classical percolation , proposed by reynolds , stanley , and klein@xcite , and generalize it to the quantum percolation .",
    "this generalization is described in sec .",
    "we derive the rg transformation , which governs the evolution of the distribution of conductance right at the transition , with increasing the sample size . in sec .",
    "iii the approximate numerical solution for the fixed point of the rg transformation is obtained .",
    "this solution determines the universal conductance distribution at the transition .",
    "it is used for calculation of the exponent @xmath0 in sec .",
    "iv . in this section",
    "we also discuss the finite size corrections . in sec .",
    "v our results for the distribution of conductance of a large sample at the transition and in its vicinity are compared with recent numerical simulations . concluding remarks are made in sec .",
    "let us briefly remind the renormalization procedure for the classical bond percolation problem on the square lattice@xcite . in this procedure a fragment of original lattice containing 8 bonds ( fig .",
    "2a ) is replaced by a fragment consisting of two _",
    "superbonds_. the probability , @xmath8 , that a superbond _ does connect _ two _ supersites _ is expressed through the corresponding probability , @xmath9 , for original lattice in a following way .",
    "firstly , the supersites are connected if all five bonds , which constitute the superbond ( see fig .",
    "2a ) , connect .",
    "the probability of this is @xmath10 .",
    "secondly , removing one of five bonds , does not affect the connectivity of the superbond , the total probability of such configurations being @xmath11 .",
    "adding the probabilities for the superbond to connect when two and three original bonds are removed , one gets the following expression for renormalized probability . @xmath12 the fixed point of the transformation ( [ til ] ) , which determines the percolation threshold , is @xmath13 and it coincides with the exact result .",
    "the equation for the critical exponent , @xmath14 , of the correlation length , @xmath15 , emerges as a condition that @xmath15 is the same for original and for renormalized lattices . if the lattice constant of the original lattice is @xmath16 , then @xmath17 . on the other hand , the lattice constant of the renormalized lattice",
    "is @xmath18 , so that @xmath19 .",
    "assuming that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are small , the two relations yield @xmath22_{p=1/2}$ ] . using eq .",
    "( [ til ] ) , one gets @xmath23 , which is only 8 percent bigger than the value @xmath24 , which is presumed to be exact .    as it was mentioned in introduction , we are interested in the situation when each bond represents a saddle  point of the random potential . then we come to fig",
    ". 2b , which can be viewed as a transformation of five original saddle  points into a _ super  saddle ",
    "point_. in classical mechanics , @xmath9 is the probability that the energy of an electron exceeds the height of the saddle  point . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "a saddle  point is characterized by reflection coefficient , @xmath25 , which is the amplitude for an incoming wave to retain the equipotential , or by transmission coefficient @xmath26the amplitude to switch the equipotential .",
    "obviously , @xmath27 . in the network",
    ", there are two incoming and two outgoing waves at each saddle  point @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath29matrix , relating the amplitudes of outgoing waves to the amplitudes of incoming waves , has the form @xmath30 with five saddle  points we have five matrix equations . solving the system ,",
    "we get the following expression for the effective transmission coefficient of the super  saddle  point @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the random phases acquired by an electron after traversing one of four loops shown in fig .",
    "this expression can be viewed as a generalization of eq .",
    "( [ til ] ) to the case of quantum percolation .",
    "it appears very convenient to parametrize @xmath33 , @xmath34 as follows @xmath35 then the parameter @xmath36 can be related to the height of the saddle  point , @xmath37 , as@xcite @xmath38 here @xmath4 is the energy of the electron , @xmath39 are the second derivatives of the saddle  point potential , and @xmath40 is the magnetic length .",
    "thus , for @xmath41 , @xmath36 is the dimensionless height of the saddle  point and eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) determines the dimensionless height , @xmath42@xmath43 , of the super  saddle ",
    "point for a given set of @xmath36 and @xmath32 .",
    "we now introduce the distribution function @xmath44 of the heights of super  saddle  points at given heights of original saddle  points .",
    "the averaging in ( [ k ] ) is carried out over the random phases @xmath32.@xcite the crucial test for applicability of the renormalization procedure to the quantum percolation is that the position of the delocalized state should remain unchanged after renormalization .",
    "suppose that in original lattice all @xmath36 were zero .",
    "then the delocalized state is at @xmath3 .",
    "after the first step of renormalization the distribution of the heights of super  saddle  points is given by @xmath45 .",
    "this function is plotted in fig .",
    "we see that it is symmetric with respect to @xmath46 , which justifies the further renormalization .",
    "note that @xmath47 at the first step , implies that the power transmission coefficient , @xmath48 , is equal to @xmath7 for all saddle  points . as it follows from fig .",
    "3a , after the first step we already get a substantial spread in @xmath49 ( the characteristic range is 0.2@xmath500.8 ) .",
    "this is the result of interference of different paths , which is described by eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) .",
    "now we can write down the renormalization group equation . denote with @xmath51 the normalized distribution function of the heights of super  saddle  points after the @xmath52-th step of renormalization",
    ". then the coresponding distribution function after the step @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 the fixed point , @xmath55 , of the transformation ( [ q ] ) determines the distribution of conductance of a large sample at the plateau transition .",
    "the equation for the fixed point , @xmath56 , is a quite complicated integral equation . in the next section",
    "we obtain its approximate solution .",
    "the crucial observation which allows to obtain an approximate solution for the fixed ",
    "point distribution @xmath55 is that within the relevant region of change of the variables of integration @xmath36 , which appears to be @xmath57 , the shape of the function @xmath58 changes rather weakly . at the same time",
    "the position of the symmetry axis of @xmath58 depends strongly on the values of @xmath36 . in other words , the kernel of the transformation ( [ q ] ) can be presented as @xmath59 , where the function @xmath60 is calculated for all @xmath47 and shown in fig .",
    "3 . by plotting @xmath58 for many sets @xmath61 (",
    "some examples are shown in fig .",
    "3b ) we had established an approximate form of the function @xmath62 : @xmath63 with coefficients @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the quadratic term in the expansion ( [ fu ] ) is non  physical .",
    "it results from the deficiency of the renormalization scheme , which is the absence of complete @xmath70 rotational symmetry ( see fig .",
    "fortunately , the corresponding coefficient , @xmath71 , is small enough , so that this term has a small effect on @xmath55 .",
    "we have verifyed it by taking this term into account as a perturbation .",
    "this term also does not affect the value of the critical exponent , @xmath0 , since it does not change upon a shift of all @xmath36 by the same value ( see below ) .",
    "we have also established ( by first neglecting and then taking into account perturbatively ) that the cubic term with coefficient @xmath72 leads to a relatively small correction to @xmath55 . on the contrary ,",
    "the cubic term with coefficient @xmath73 appears to be very important .    after neglecting the quadratic and the last cubic terms in ( [ fu ] )",
    "the function @xmath74 decomposes into the sum of functions of different arguments .",
    "owing to this , a great simplification can be achieved by taking the fourier transform of both parts in eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) .",
    "one gets @xmath75 ^ 4 \\int dz_3 q_n(z_3)e^{i\\omega(c_3z_3-\\lambda_3z_3 ^ 3)},\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the fourier transform of @xmath51 and @xmath77 is the fourier transform of @xmath60 .",
    "now the solution for the fixed point @xmath78 can be easily obtained numerically .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "4 . except for the tails at @xmath79",
    "it can be well approximated by a gaussian @xmath80 with @xmath81 . in the right  hand side of eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) there is a product of five functions @xmath82 . having @xmath81 , the 5dimensional volume , which provides the major contribution to the integral in ( [ q ] ) , can be estimated as @xmath83 .",
    "we see that the fixed  point distribution is broad .",
    "width is @xmath84 , which corresponds to the range @xmath85 for the power transmission coefficient . in the next section we use the solution obtained for calculation of the critical exponent @xmath0 .",
    "we first address the critical exponent of the localization length .",
    "suppose that before the renormalization the distribution of @xmath86 is already given by @xmath55 .",
    "then for electron with a small but non  zero energy , @xmath4 , this distribution is given by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 ( see eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) ) . substituting @xmath87 into the right  hand side of the transformation ( [ q ] ) one",
    "gets a renormalized distribution , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is some number , independent of @xmath91 . upon repeating the procedure",
    ", the shift will grow as @xmath92 and , eventually , become @xmath93 . at this step",
    "an electron will be strongly localized in a renormalized lattice of super  saddle - points ( within @xmath93 unit cell ) .",
    "thus , one should identify the localization length , @xmath94 , with a lattice constant after these @xmath52 steps , which is equal to @xmath95 .",
    "then the condition @xmath96 can be rewritten as @xmath97 , and one has @xmath98 with @xmath99 the remaining task is to calculate parameter @xmath90 using eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) . for small @xmath91",
    "the result of substituting @xmath87 into the right  hand side can be presented as @xmath100 at small @xmath86 the first term behaves as @xmath101 , while the second term is proportional to @xmath86 ( due to symmetry ) . as a result , the maximum of the sum ( [ sub ] ) will get shifted from @xmath46 to @xmath102 , where @xmath103 to proceed further we adopt the same simplification , @xmath104 , as was adopted to find the fixed point @xmath55 .",
    "then one has @xmath105.\\ ] ] note that non  physical quadratic term in ( [ fu ] ) did not contribute to ( [ der ] ) . after substituting ( [ der ] ) into ( [ rat ] )",
    "it is again convenient perform the fourier transformation and then to make use of eq .",

    "since @xmath110 were determined with certain error bars , we repeated the calculations and for @xmath111 ( the effect of @xmath112 is small ) and got @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "the results of most numerical simulations are grouped around @xmath115 .    despite the agreement obtained",
    ", we can not estimate the accuracy of the result , since the calculation was based on the assumption that the shape of the kernel of the transformation ( [ q ] ) is independent of @xmath116 .",
    "in fact the width of the distribution @xmath117 decreases slowly with increasing @xmath118 , and , correspondingly , @xmath77 broadens .",
    "we found that at the boundary of the relevant region of the change of @xmath36 , @xmath57 , the width of @xmath77 increases by @xmath119 percent .",
    "we could not include this effect in our calculation . to obtain the limiting estimate we repeated the calculation assuming that the width of @xmath77 is @xmath120 percent bigger for _ all _ @xmath36 .",
    "this caused the reduction of @xmath0 to @xmath121 .",
    "in conclusion of the section let us discuss the question how the distribution @xmath51 approaches the fixed ",
    "point distribution @xmath55 with increasing the sample size . to answer this question",
    "let us introduce the deviation @xmath122 and linearize the transformation ( [ q ] ) .",
    "after using the above simplification for @xmath117 and performing the fourier transform , we get @xmath123\\delta q_n(z),\\ ] ] where @xmath124 if initial perturbation was @xmath125 , then after @xmath52 steps it will evolve to @xmath126 .",
    "the relevant perturbations are the even functions of @xmath86 , satisfying the condition @xmath127 @xmath128 ( i. e. @xmath129 ) , to keep @xmath51 normalized .",
    "we were able to make the complete analysis of the transformation ( [ lin ] ) only in the case @xmath130 .",
    "the answer is as follows . the fluctuations for which , at @xmath131 , @xmath132 behaves as @xmath133 , @xmath134 being integer , decay with increasing @xmath52 as @xmath135 , where @xmath136 .",
    "the slowest decay is characterized by the exponent @xmath137 .    with finite @xmath110",
    "there is no such a simple classification .",
    "we could only see that the exponent increases significantly up to the value @xmath138 . at large @xmath139",
    "this exponent would determine the finite  size correction to the conductance distribution and , thus , to the average conductance , variance and all the moments .",
    "the fixed  point distribution @xmath55 is directly related to the distribution function of the conductance at the plateau transition .",
    "after an appropriate number of the renormalization steps the entire sample reduces to a single super ",
    "point ; the power transmission coefficient of this super  saddle  point would determine the conductance of the sample , @xmath140 , with @xmath141 .",
    "then the distribution function of @xmath142 can be found from the relation @xmath143 yielding @xmath144 the distribution function @xmath145 is shown in fig .",
    "it is very broad .",
    "this fact was first pointed out in the experimental paper@xcite and then reproduced in the numerical simulations of cho and fisher@xcite .",
    "as a distinctive feature , the distribution function ( [ cond ] ) has a shallow minimum at @xmath146 . using this function we calculated the variance @xmath147 and obtained the value @xmath148 , which agrees with the result of ref .. to compare our results with the recent simulations by wang , jovanovi and d.h .",
    "lee@xcite we have calculated the moments of the distribution @xmath145 , defined as @xmath149 , where @xmath52 is an even integer which we have changed from @xmath150 up to @xmath151 . the results are shown in fig . 6 together with the values @xmath152 and @xmath153 , obtained in the simulations of ref .. the agreement is quite good .    finally we have studied how the variance , @xmath154 , falls off as the energy , @xmath4 , deviates from the position of the delocalized state @xmath41 . as it was mentioned above , for non ",
    "zero energy the distribution of @xmath86 is given by @xmath155 , where @xmath156 , @xmath139 being the sample size",
    ". then one has @xmath157 the dependence @xmath154 is shown in fig .",
    "7 . to compare it with the simulations of ref .",
    "we had to establish the correspondence between our dimensionless energy @xmath158 and the one adopted in ref . .",
    "we did it by calculating the average @xmath159 and fitting it to the curve in@xcite .",
    "the agreement is again quite reasonable , especially taking into account some asymmetry of the numerical results .",
    "however , strictly speaking , the distribution of @xmath86 at finite @xmath4 has the form @xmath155 only if @xmath160 is smaller than @xmath161 .",
    "note in conclusion of the section , that identifying the conductance @xmath142 with the transmission through the last super ",
    "point implies that sweeping the electron energy through @xmath3 causes an increase of @xmath142 from @xmath162 to @xmath161 .",
    "this was the case for the experimental geometry of ref . .",
    "certainly , the renormalization scheme for quantum percolation , developed in the present paper , provides only an approximate description of the plateau transition . as in classical percolation , when , in the course of renormalization , one ascribes a certain probability to a superbond with no care about the condition of surrounding bonds , our quantum generalization leaves out many interference processes .",
    "this happens at the stage when we average over the phases , @xmath32 , in eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) . by doing",
    "so we assume the phases of transmission coefficients of super  saddle  points to be uncorrelated , which in reality is not the case .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , the above approach is the first one in which the characteristics of the quantum hall transition are obtained from the solution of a certain closed equation . by taking into account only basic interference processes at _ each _ scale",
    ", we were able to reproduce the results of numerical simulations in which _ all _ interference processes were taken into account .",
    "our approach does not require extrapolation to infinite sizes .",
    "this might be important in the cases when the result of such an extrapolation is rather ambigous .",
    "for example , when there are two ( several ) delocalized states _ very close _ in energy ( zeeman split levels , higher landau levels ) . in this case the network should carry more than one channel and allow for their mixing@xcite .",
    "formal generalization of the rg equation ( [ q ] ) to this case is straightforward , however its approximate solution ( as in sec .",
    "iii ) might be not sufficient .",
    "note finally , that the rg results for the classical bond percolation problem can be significantly improved by considering a bigger cluster@xcite . using the rules , formulated in sec .",
    "ii , this advanced scheme can be also generalized to quantum percolation .",
