    "the dark matter problem provides one of the strongest reasons to suspect the existence of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "we will explore the possibility that dark matter is mirror matter in this paper .",
    "our objective is to understand the growth of density perturbations in the linear regime in such a universe , taking adiabatic scale - invariant perturbations as the input . in doing so ,",
    "we both confirm and extend the results of ref .",
    "@xcite . by comparing mirror dark matter ( mdm ) with conventional cold , warm and hot dark matter ( cdm , wdm and hdm , respectively )",
    ", we hope to explain the physics of mirror dark matter in as clear a way as possible , and to pinpoint the data that are most sensitive to its characteristic features .    before launching into the analysis , we should set the stage by briefly reviewing the evidence for non - baryonic dark matter , and explaining why we think mirror matter is an interesting candidate .",
    "it is very well established that the dynamics of objects ranging in size from galaxies up to clusters of galaxies can not be understood using standard gravity unless one postulates that invisible matter dominates over the visible by a factor of @xmath6 .",
    "( it is also logically possible that our understanding of gravity at large scales is incomplete @xcite , though we will not pursue that possibility here . )",
    "it has been known for some time that the conservative option of the dark material being simply ordinary matter in the form of non - luminous objects such as `` jupiters '' , neutron stars , and so on , is ruled out if one accepts that the light elements h , d , @xmath7he and @xmath8li were created through big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "the baryon - to - photon ratio is the one free parameter in standard bbn , and the value required to produce fair agreement with the primordial abundance data is a factor of five or so too small to account for all the dark matter required to successfully model the gravitational dynamics of clusters .",
    "ordinary baryonic dark matter is also inconsistent with successful large scale structure formation , principally because perturbation growth begins too late .",
    "in addition , acoustic peak data from cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements , including those very recently reported by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) collaboration , have independently pointed to a matter - to - baryon density ratio of about six @xcite .",
    "so , if one accepts standard hot big bang cosmology , then one must perforce accept the existence of non - baryonic dark matter .    acknowledging the reality of non - baryonic dark matter",
    ", one can maintain conservatism by supposing that massive ordinary neutrinos provide the additional matter density . while this is a natural and obvious possibility",
    ", it runs foul of large scale structure data .",
    "a successful account of large scale structure , the concern of this paper and one of the most important problems in physics @xcite , must be part of a successful cosmology .",
    "neutrino dark matter is the archetype of hdm , inducing `` top - down '' structure formation whereby very large structures form first , with smaller ones arising from subsequent fragmentation .",
    "hot dark matter driven `` top - down '' scenarios are now ruled out by the data : more structure is observed at small scales than possible with hdm ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .    to sum up : the confluence of galactic / cluster dynamics , big bang nucleosynthesis , acoustic peak , gravitational lensing and large scale structure data strongly point to a universe whose material or positive - pressure component is roughly @xmath9 luminous baryonic , @xmath10 dark baryonic , and @xmath11 exotic .",
    "this is a remarkable conclusion . of the critical value giving a spatially flat universe @xcite . with the strong evidence for flatness from the acoustic peak features , one",
    "is also obliged to add a @xmath12 non - material , negative - pressure component called `` dark energy '' , as also suggested by sn1a observations @xcite .",
    "note also that much of the dark baryonic matter , for high red shifts , has now been detected through lyman-@xmath5 studies . ]",
    "it is very interesting that the exotic dark component must consist of _ stable _ forms of matter , or at least extremely long - lived .",
    "while exotic unstable particles abound in extensions of the standard model , completely new stable degrees of freedom pose a more profound model - building challenge .",
    "the stability challenge is fully met by mirror matter .",
    "the mirror matter model arose from the aesthetic desire to retain the improper lorentz transformations as exact invariances of nature despite the @xmath13 character of weak interactions @xcite.e@xmath14 string theory , and brane - world constructions such as the `` manyfold '' universe @xcite . ]",
    "it does so by postulating that , first , the gauge group of the world is a product of two isomorphic factors , @xmath15 , and , second , that an exact discrete @xmath16 parity symmetry , unbroken by the vacuum , interchanges the two sectors .",
    "the minimal mirror matter model takes @xmath17 to be simply the standard model gauge group su(3)@xmath18su(2)@xmath18u(1 ) .",
    "all ordinary particles except the graviton receive a mirror partner .",
    "a mirror particle has the same mass as the corresponding ordinary particle , and mirror particles interact amongst themselves in the same way that ordinary particles do , except that mirror weak interactions are right - handed rather than left - handed .",
    "the two sectors must interact with each other gravitationally , with certain other interaction channels also generally open , though controlled by free parameters that can be arbitrarily small .",
    "the possible non - gravitational interactions include photon  mirror - photon kinetic mixing @xcite , neutrino  mirror - neutrino mass mixing @xcite , and higgs - boson  mirror - higgs - boson mixing @xcite .",
    "we will assume , for simplicity , that all of these parameters are small enough to be neglected .",
    "( one should bear in mind , however , that photon  mirror - photon kinetic mixing can cause remarkable phenomena even with a controlling parameter as small as @xmath19 @xcite . )",
    "mirror protons and mirror electrons are stable for exactly the same reason that ordinary matter is stable .",
    "one would expect that mirror matter would have existed in the cosmological plasma of the early universe .",
    "if so , mirror matter relics in the form of gas clouds , planets , stars , galaxies and so on might well be common in the universe today , manifesting observationally as dark matter .",
    "most prior work on mdm , with the notable exception of ref .",
    "@xcite , has focussed on the astrophysical phenomenology of compact mirror matter objects , hybrid ordinary - mirror systems , and diffuse mirror matter gas / dust in our own solar system @xcite .",
    "the discovery of mirror matter through such means would , obviously , be a major breakthrough . in this paper , however , we turn to the other generic purpose of dark matter : to assist the growth of density perturbations in the early universe , thus initiating large scale structure formation .",
    "we want , ultimately , to know if mirror dark matter is consistent with large scale structure data , and , if it is , to develop observables that can discriminate between mdm and the current paradigm of collisionless cdm ( and whatever other candidates might be dreamed up ) .    from the macroscopic perspective ,",
    "mirror matter is a much more complicated dark matter candidate than standard cdm particles such as axions and wimps . rather than just one species of particle , mirror dark matter",
    "is chemically complicated , consisting of all the mirror analogues of ordinary matter : protons , neutrons and electrons .",
    "further , mdm is self - interacting , and a background of mirror photons and mirror neutrinos interacts with the mirror - baryonic matter .",
    "however , since ( i ) the self - interactions of the mirror particles are by construction identical to those of ordinary particles except for the chirality flip , and ( ii ) the interaction between ordinary and mirror matter is by assumption dominated by standard gravity , the mdm universe can be analysed through well - defined physics despite the complex nature of the dark sector .",
    "it is not necessarily a virtue for dm to consist of a single exotic species such as a wimp or axion .",
    "indeed , in their recent review peebles and ratra @xcite emphasised that standard cdm can be viewed as the calculationally simplest dm scenario that , in broad terms , is phenomenologically acceptable , but which may be subject to revision or replacement when more detailed large scale structure data are collected .",
    "they then point out that certain data already challenge standard cdm on points of detail , though they caution that these discrepancies might in the end be due to calculational problems only .",
    "we take the view that all well - motivated standard model extensions supplying stable exotic species should be investigated for their dm potential .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sect : mdmcosmo ] , we review the elements of cosmology in a universe with mirror matter , and explain why there need not be a @xmath20 mixture of ordinary and mirror matter .",
    "sections [ sect : jeans ] and [ sect : silk ] then discuss two key scales in the perturbation evolution problem : the jeans length and silk scale for mirror baryons .",
    "the former determines the scale at which sub - horizon sized modes can begin to grow in the dark matter ( mirror ) sector , while the latter determines the scale below which growth is damped .",
    "section [ sect : spectra ] discusses the outcomes of the linear growth regime through final processed spectra for mirror dark matter perturbations .",
    "it also discusses lyman-@xmath5 forest data , cmbr anisotropy and early reionisation .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sect : conclusion ] .",
    "we begin by dispelling a common misconception regarding mirror matter .",
    "one might navely expect that the exact discrete symmetry between the ordinary and mirror sectors in the lagrangian would require the universe to contain , and to have always contained , a precisely @xmath20 mixture of ordinary and mirror particles .",
    "such a universe would be inconsistent with the standard cosmological framework . first , the doubling of the universal expansion rate due to mirror photons , neutrinos and antineutrinos would completely spoil big bang nucleosynthesis . even if some way could be found to counteract the additional relativistic species",
    ", there would be a second objection . as we reviewed above",
    ", observations favour a dm to baryon density ratio of about five , comfortably larger than two .",
    "so , does an exact discrete mirror symmetry at the microscopic level of fundamental interactions imply that the ordinary and mirror matter densities in the universe must always be equal @xcite ? in one sense , it is trivial to see that the answer is `` no '' .",
    "one may simply adopt asymmetric initial conditions at the big bang . in that case",
    ", the temperature @xmath21 of the mirror plasma in the early universe , and the background mirror photons today @xmath22 , is different from that of the ordinary plasma , @xmath23 , and the ordinary cosmic microwave background photons today , @xmath24 .",
    "one of the fundamental parameters in our cosmology will therefore be @xmath25 since the energy density of relativistic species goes as the fourth power of temperature , the contribution of the light mirror degrees of freedom to the cosmological density is strongly suppressed by @xmath26 .",
    "even a small difference between the temperatures , such as a factor of @xmath27 , is enough to comply with the bbn upper bound on extra relativistic energy density .",
    "this removes the first objection to mirror matter cosmology",
    ".    one might be uncomfortable with ascribing the macroscopic asymmetry of the universe to asymmetric initial conditions .",
    "however , standard friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology already has a raft of problems associated with initial conditions : homogeneity , spatial flatness , etc .",
    "one approach to those problems is , of course , inflationary cosmology .",
    "interestingly , prior work has shown that inflation can also effectively initialise a mirror matter universe to have @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "one way is to introduce a mirror inflaton to partner the ordinary inflaton within the chaotic inflation paradigm . since the stochastic processes germinating inflation will not comply with the discrete symmetry on an event - by - event basis , the main result follows .    what about the second objection to mirror matter cosmology",
    "? given that @xmath29 , one might conclude that the mirror baryons would have a correspondingly lower density than their ordinary counterparts , thus exacerbating the problem of not enough mdm .",
    "this conclusion would be true if the magnitudes of the baryon asymmetries in the two sectors were equal .",
    "however , we have to take into account that the inequality of temperatures of ordinary and mirror matter will in general change the outcome of baryogenesis in the two sectors , even though the microphysics is the same @xcite .",
    "one expects in fact that @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number density of ordinary species @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the number density of mirror species @xmath34 .",
    "( we denote the mirror partner to a given particle by a prime . )",
    "the ratio of mirror baryon and ordinary baryon number densities can be written as @xmath35 because the baryons and mirror baryons have equal rest masses and are highly non - relativistic for the epochs we consider , this quantity is also approximately the energy density ratio , @xmath36 where , as usual , @xmath37 denotes the energy density of @xmath32 in units of the critical density . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the mirror baryon asymmetry can be _",
    "greater _ than the ordinary baryon asymmetry , and can in fact overwhelm the @xmath38 factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegabratio ] ) : @xmath39 two quite different baryogenesis scenarios were analysed in ref .",
    "@xcite : the out - of - equilibrium baryon - number violating decays of massive bosons and electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "interestingly , in both cases @xmath40 with an acceptable @xmath41 could be obtained provided that @xmath42 we will use this value as an indicative lower limit to cosmologically interesting values of @xmath2 .",
    "it obviously should not be taken as definitive , because we do not yet know what baryogenesis mechanism actually operates in nature .",
    "( a new mechanism involving mirror matter has been very recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . )    motivated by the above results , we take @xmath43 as the second free parameter in our cosmology , fixed only by observational data .    before moving on , we should deal with a third possible objection to mirror dark matter , this one based on the results of recent works constraining self - interacting cdm . recall that an extension of standard cdm through self - interactions was proposed to circumvent the problem of overdense cores for some types of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the required properties were that the elastic scattering cross - section of dm particle on dm particle should lie in the interval @xmath44 @xmath45gev , and the dm should remain dissipationless .",
    "these constraints are violated by mdm because it is dissipative and , if we take an atomic hydrogen cross - section as a guide , then the self - interaction strength is too high .",
    "however , the two cases are not directly comparable . the evolution of mdm is much more complicated than that of the self - interacting cdm considered in ref .  @xcite .",
    "for instance , mdm would form more intrinsic structure ( mirror stars and other compact objects ) than self - interacting cdm , so it is not just a question of scattering cross - sections .",
    "exactly what sorts of compact mirror matter objects would form , and how they would be distributed , is a very complicated question beyond the scope of this work .",
    "this development will _ not _ parallel that of the ordinary sector .",
    "for instance , one of the key parameters affecting the galaxy formation process  the rate of star creation  will be different because primordial nucleosynthesis in the mirror sector will produce much more mirror helium relative to mirror hydrogen than is the case for their ordinary analogues @xcite .",
    "let us see how the main cosmological equations are changed by the presence of mirror matter @xcite .",
    "the friedmann equation for a flat universe becomes @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the total energy density , ordinary plus mirror ( plus vacuum ) @xmath48 and the hubble parameter @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the scale factor . in terms of the present - day energy densities ,",

    "( [ eq : rhor ] ) we see that the contribution of mirror particles to the relativistic energy density can be neglected at all times because @xmath61 due to the bbn constraint @xmath62 .",

    "the @xmath69 preferred range for @xmath70 is @xmath71 @xcite .",

    "@xcite , narayanan et al use lyman-@xmath5 data to constrain the mass @xmath160 of the wdm particle through its free - streaming scale @xmath161 , given by @xmath162 in terms of the cosmological wdm density @xmath163 .",
    "they obtain @xmath164 for an @xmath165 universe . adopting the resulting upper bound on @xmath161 as a rough bound on @xmath1",
    ", we get from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mirrorsilkevaluated ] ) , ( [ eq : wdmfreestreamingscale ] ) and ( [ eq : wdmmassbound ] ) that @xmath166 where @xmath167 was used for consistency . this bound appears to be more stringent than the @xmath156 range obtained by requiring that @xmath0 be sub - galactic .",
    "over the past decade the measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy provided us with a powerful tool for finding the cosmological parameters and studying the structure formation in the universe .",
    "in particular , recent wmap data @xcite have established that the adiabatic perturbation scenario is favoured over isocurvature perturbations . a natural question is then : could the cmb data help us in discriminating between mdm and other types of dark matter ?    from our previous discussion",
    "it follows that the new features of the mdm power spectrum might leave an imprint on the cmb anisotropy at small angular scales , dictated by eq.([eq : lambdamax ] ) . with decreasing @xmath2",
    "these angular scales become smaller which corresponds to the larger values of @xmath168 .",
    "thus we could expect a non - negligible effect only at larger @xmath2 which is comparatively less interesting in view of the arguments presented above .",
    "however , it could be worthwhile to give further precision to this qualitative argument before a final conclusion can be made . in any case",
    ", this follow - up study should be done in combination with the analysis of the large - scale structure surveys such as 2df and the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "no matter what the value of @xmath2 , there is no doubt that the non - linear evolution of mdm must be very different from that of standard cdm .",
    "we certainly expect mdm to eventually form mirror stars , mirror galaxies , and so on , by analogy with ordinary matter .",
    "however , the details of this evolution can not be an exact parallel to that of ordinary matter .",
    "one very important reason for this is that the mirror - helium to mirror - hydrogen ratio from mirror primordial nucleosynthesis will be significantly higher than its ordinary counterpart , thus affecting star formation and evolution , which in turn will influence mirror galaxy formation .",
    "no one has yet attempted a detailed study of this interesting topic , apart from pointing out relatively obvious consequences such as the faster evolution of mirror stars , and we have no progress to report ourselves .",
    "suffice it to say that purely observational searches for compact mirror objects within and in the halo of our galaxy should be pursued irrespective of the status of theoretical investigations .",
    "the detection of early reionisation by wmap is potentially highly relevant for mdm .",
    "early reionisation implies early ( ordinary ) star formation , which in turn requires sufficient power on small scales to encourage gravitationally collapsed objects to form . indeed , since wmap claims to have ruled out wdm through this means , one might be concerned that mdm is similarly ruled out .",
    "this is not obviously so , however .",
    "the earliest stars must arise from some rare large amplitude fluctuations going non - linear .",
    "but since wdm is non - dissipative , whereas mdm is chemically complex and dissipative , the analogy between the two breaks down in the non - linear regime .",
    "it is _ a priori _ possible that the collisional damping of small scale perturbations is compensated by the greater capacity of mdm to clump compared to regular wdm .",
    "this is a very interesting topic for future studies of mdm .",
    "mirror matter is a natural dark matter candidate because it is stable .",
    "furthermore , the mirror matter model has aesthetic appeal through its invariance under the full poincar group , including improper lorentz transformations .",
    "because the microphysics of mirror matter is basically identical to that of ordinary matter , the study of its cosmological implications is well - defined , depending on a small number of _ a priori _ free parameters ( the ratio of the relic mirror photon temperature to that of ordinary relic photons @xmath2 and the mirror baryon mass density @xmath169 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we have looked at the linear regime of density perturbations for mirror dark matter in more detail than the previous major study of ref .",
    "we deduced the semi - quantitative features of the processed power spectrum for mdm , compared it to standard cdm and hdm and explained the origin of the differences .",
    "a mdm power spectrum is characterised by a peak at the scale @xmath0 which is itself a function of @xmath2 and @xmath169 .",
    "the first structures to form will have size @xmath0 . requiring this scale to be sub - galactic implies that @xmath2 should be less than about @xmath170 . because bottom - up structure formation is favoured over top - down",
    ", we conclude that this is in fact the favoured range for the temperature ratio .",
    "it is encouraging that mdm can behave very similarly to standard cdm for reasonable values of @xmath2 and @xmath169 .",
    "however , observational differences hopefully also exist and should be used to discriminate between the two candidates .",
    "future lyman-@xmath5 forest data probing structure at small scales will further challenge the standard cdm paradigm , with the prospect of uncovering a subtle discrepancy , or of constraining models featuring small scale damping even further . for mdm",
    ", a constraint on small scale damping translates into an upper bound on @xmath2 . by using an analogy with warm dm , we estimated an upper bound of about @xmath171 . at some point , the need for a smaller @xmath2 could clash with plausible mechanisms for baryogenesis , though our ignorance of the correct baryogenesis mechanism will prevent a rigorous ruling out of mdm by this means .",
    "more optimistically , the hypothetical discovery of small scale damping would specify the value of @xmath2 .",
    "the non - linear regime obviously will differ strongly , with the generic expectation of compact mirror objects ( stars , planets , meteorites ) and structures ( galaxies and so on ) .",
    "the discovery of early reionisation by wmap potentially provides important input into the comparison of the mdm scenario with the real universe .",
    "exploitation of this opportunity is not straightforward , however , because the dissipative and chemically complex nature of mdm acts as a barrier to confident theoretical analysis of the formation of the earliest stars in the mdm universe .    finally , if mirror matter supplies all of the non - baryonic dark matter , then existing dark matter searches for wimps and axions should fail .",
    "( it is of course possible that the universe contains both mdm and standard cdm , even though we did not focus on that hypothesis here . )          for recent discussions see g. steigman , astro - ph/0208186 ; p. di bari , astro - ph/0302433 ; phys .",
