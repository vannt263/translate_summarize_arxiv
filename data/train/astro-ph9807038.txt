    "in a cosmological model with closed , nontrivial space topology , a distant astronomical source is predicted to produce several images , corresponding to the diffferent paths its radiation can take to reach the observer on earth .",
    "see lachize - rey & luminet @xcite for a review .",
    "theoretically these multiconnected spatial sections are manifolds @xmath0 of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the universal covering space of @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a discrete group of isometries acting freely on @xmath5 .",
    "this action tesselates @xmath2 into cells which are copies of a fundamental polyhedron ( fp ) .",
    "the fp has an even number of faces , which are pairwise congruent ; @xmath0 may be represented by the fp , with members of these pairs identified ( more colloquially , they are  `` glued together '' ; more technically , see massey @xcite ) .    in practice one",
    "looks at the fp as the physical space where the observer and the sources exist , and at its copies as the apparent space of repeated cosmic images . hence the tendency to consider those images within the fp as ` real , ' those in other cells as ` ghosts . ' but it also appears reasonable to call real the nearest image of an object , the other ones being the  ghosts .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to show that these two criteria for classifying multiple images are not always consistent with each other .",
    "one of the possible universe models with einstein - de sitter metric    @xmath6 has as spatial section the orientable manifold e2 in fig .",
    "17 of @xcite .",
    "a klein bottle surface @xmath7 is imbedded in e2 , so we may use this nonorientable surface as our simplified model of cosmic space .",
    "it turns out that the fp ( here fundamental _ polygon _ ) is not unique ; it depends on an arbitrary _ basepoint _ in its definition : the fp of a manifold @xmath8 with basepoint @xmath9 is the set of points @xmath10 _",
    "_ distance__@xmath11 _ _",
    "distance__@xmath12    let @xmath0 @xmath13 be the klein bottle obtained from the square @xmath14 of side length @xmath15 in fig .",
    "1 , with coordinates @xmath16 and basepoint @xmath17 this fundamental polygon will be called fp0 .",
    "group @xmath4 is generated by the motions    @xmath18    and @xmath2 is the euclidean plane .",
    "the identified pairs of sides are @xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "now we choose another basepoint , @xmath21 and find the corresponding fp as indicated in fig .",
    "1 . the six images of @xmath22 in the figure ( @xmath23 are sufficient to determine the irregular hexagon @xmath24 as fp1",
    ". the points on line @xmath25 are equidistant from @xmath22 and @xmath26 , and thus belong to the border ; and similarly for the other sides .",
    "the coordinates of the vertices are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and the identifications are @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35",
    "in fig . 2 , let the observer s position be @xmath22 , and two images of a cosmic source be located at @xmath36 and @xmath37 the nearest image is @xmath38 , and if the observer is using fp1 , then by both criteria at the end of sec .",
    "i @xmath38 would be the real image and @xmath39 a ghost .",
    "but if she or he is using fp0 , which is much easier to handle mathematically despite the fact that the observer is _ not _ at its center , then by first criterion the real image is @xmath39 and @xmath38 is a ghost , with the opposite holding by the second rule .    therefore , in order that the terminology ` real ' vs. ` ghost ' ( or ` source ' vs. ` ghost ' ) could be used consistently , one would have to always work with an fp where the basepoint is at the observer s position .",
    "a further advantage of thus having the nearest images labeled as sources would be in the comparison with astrophysical data , which are usually richer for nearby objects .",
    "however , the calculations are much simpler in the more symmetrical fp like fp0 above , or in those fp s which mathematicians say have `` maximum injectivity radius '' - see weeks @xcite , for example .",
    "this is what was done by the author in @xcite , where the fp is a regular icosahedron with basepoint at its center , far from the observer s position ."
