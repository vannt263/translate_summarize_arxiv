    "the history of fractional calculus ( fc ) goes back more than three centuries , when in 1695 the derivative of order @xmath3 was described by leibniz .",
    "since then , the new theory turned out to be very attractive to mathematicians and many different forms of fractional operators were introduced : the grunwald - letnikov , riemann - liouville , riesz , and caputo fractional derivatives ( see , , @xcite ) , and the more recent notions of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . besides mathematics , fractional derivatives and integrals appear in physics , mechanics , engineering , elasticity , dynamics , control theory , economics , biology , chemistry , etc .",

    "the fc is nowadays covered by several books ( , @xcite ) and a large number of relevant papers ( see , , @xcite ) .",
    "the calculus of variations is an old branch of optimization theory that has many applications both in physics and geometry ( @xcite and references therein ) . apart from a few examples known since ancient times such as queen dido s problem ( reported in _",
    "the aeneid _ by virgil ) , the problem of finding optimal curves and surfaces has been posed first by physicists such as newton , huygens , and galileo .",
    "their contemporary mathematicians , starting with the bernoulli brothers and leibniz , followed by euler and lagrange , invented the calculus of variations of a functional in order to solve those problems .",
    "fractional calculus of variations ( fcv ) unifies the calculus of variations and the fractional calculus , by inserting fractional derivatives into the variational integrals .",
    "this occurs naturally in many problems of physics or mechanics , in order to provide more accurate models of physical phenomena ( see , , @xcite ) .",
    "the fcv started in 1996 with the work of @xcite .",
    "riewe formulated the problem of the calculus of variations with fractional derivatives and obtained the respective euler - lagrange equations , combining both conservative and nonconservative cases . nowadays",
    "the fcv is a subject under strong research .",
    "different definitions for fractional derivatives and integrals are used , depending on the purpose under study .",
    "investigations cover problems depending on riemann - liouville fractional derivatives ( see , , @xcite ) , the caputo fractional derivative ( see , , @xcite ) , the symmetric fractional derivative ( see , , @xcite ) , the jumarie fractional derivative ( see , , @xcite ) , and others ( see , , @xcite ) .",
    "although the literature of fcv is already vast , much remains to be done .    in this paper",
    "we extend the notion of the caputo fractional derivative to the fractional derivative @xmath0 , which is a convex combination of the left caputo fractional derivative of order @xmath1 and the right caputo fractional derivative of order @xmath2 .",
    "this idea goes back at least as far as @xcite , where based on the riemann - liouville fractional derivatives the symmetric fractional derivative was introduced .",
    "klimek s approach is obtained choosing our parameter @xmath4 to be @xmath5 .",
    "although the symmetric fractional derivative of riemann  liouville introduced by klimek is a useful tool in the description of some nonconservative models , this type of differentiation does not seems suitable for all kinds of variational problems .",
    "the hypothesis that admissible trajectories @xmath6 have continuous symmetric fractional derivatives implies that @xmath7 ( .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore",
    ", the advantage of the fractional derivative @xmath0 via caputo lies in the fact that using this derivative we can describe a more general class of variational problems .",
