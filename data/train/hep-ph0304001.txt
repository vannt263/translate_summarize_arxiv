    "the commissioning of polarized proton beams with energies from 100 to 250 gev at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite has started a new stage in physics of spin - dependent collisions .",
    "in particular , measurement of spin - dependent parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) will be the top priority in the experiments with longitudinal polarization .",
    "so far , these spin - dependent counterparts of the unpolarized pdfs were constrained only by the lepton - nucleon deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) data @xcite , which concentrates at relatively small momentum transfers ( @xmath4 ) . in contrast , rhic will explore the spin - dependent pdfs in a much larger range of @xmath5 and using a variety of spin - dependent particle reactions , including production of drell - yan lepton pairs and resonant production of @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons @xcite .",
    "vector boson production ( vbp ) with polarized hadron beams , which proceeds through annihilation of a quark and antiquark at the born level , is the most natural candidate to probe spin - dependent quark polarizations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in @xmath6 collisions the born level cross sections are sensitive to the distributions of sea quarks . in this sense",
    ", vbp complements production of jets , pions , and heavy quark flavors , which primarily probe the gluon distribution .",
    "no wonder that extensive bibliography is dedicated to spin - dependent production of drell - yan pairs @xcite and massive electroweak bosons @xcite .",
    "the production of @xmath2 bosons presents a particularly interesting opportunity to learn about the quark spin structure due to the maximal violation of space - reflection parity in the @xmath7 coupling and non - trivial mixing of the quark flavors through the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite .",
    "while the former feature allows non - vanishing single - spin cross section asymmetries ( which are simpler than the parity - conserving double - spin asymmetries ) , the latter feature facilitates the study of the flavor dependence of the sea quark pdfs .",
    "the issue of flavor symmetry breaking in the polarized quark sea was brought in the limelight recently by the results on semi - inclusive hadroproduction in spin - dependent dis by hermes collaboration @xcite . in that measurement ,",
    "the issues of higher - order and higher - twist corrections are an important consideration due to small values of @xmath5 . at the same time , @xmath8 boson production at rhic has a potential to pin down the quark sea flavor structure at large @xmath5 , i.e. , at energies where perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) is truly valid .    the original method @xcite for the measurement of polarized pdfs in @xmath8 boson production at rhic relies on the reconstruction of the spin - dependent distribution @xmath9 over the rapidity @xmath10 of the @xmath8 bosons .",
    "the method is based on the observation that the born level single - spin asymmetry of @xmath9 is described by a simple theoretical expression , which further reduces to the ratio @xmath11 of the polarized and unpolarized pdfs when the absolute value of @xmath10 is large .",
    "unfortunately , the application of this method is obstructed by specifics of the detection of the @xmath2 bosons at rhic .",
    "since neither of rhic detectors controls the energy balance in particle reactions , the energy and momentum of the neutrino in the decay are completely unknown , so that the information about the momentum of the @xmath8 boson is incomplete . as a result ,",
    "the determination of the rapidity @xmath10 of the @xmath8 boson from the observation of just one charged lepton is generally impossible .",
    "it can be shown that the ambiguity in the reconstruction of @xmath10 reduces to the uncertainty in the knowledge of the transverse momentum @xmath0 of the @xmath8 boson @xcite .",
    "if @xmath0 were known exactly , the rapidity @xmath10 of the @xmath8 boson can be derived ( up to a two - fold ambiguity ) from the measured rapidity @xmath12 and transverse momentum @xmath13 of the charged lepton ( see the accompanying paper @xcite for more details on this reconstruction method ) .",
    "for instance , if all @xmath8 bosons were produced through the born process @xmath14 , the transverse momentum @xmath0 would be zero , and the correct solution for @xmath10 can be chosen statistically for the leptons with large absolute values of the lepton rapidity @xmath12 , i.e. , escaping near the beam pipe direction .",
    "in reality , the @xmath2 bosons carry a non - zero transverse momentum due to qcd radiation , with the most probable magnitude in the unpolarized case of about 2 gev . most of the @xmath2 bosons obtain a non - zero @xmath0 through the radiation of soft and collinear partons , which can not be approximated by finite - order perturbative calculations .",
    "since the power series in the strong coupling @xmath15 does not converge in the small-@xmath0 region , summation of dominant logarithmic terms through all orders of this series is needed .",
    "this all - order summation can be realized with the help of the methods that were studied in a substantial detail @xcite in the unpolarized case .",
    "note , however , that the properties of the multiple parton radiation depend on the spin of the initial hadrons .",
    "the spin dependence of the collinear radiation off the external parton lines can be seen from an explicit calculation .",
    "an additional spin dependence can be contributed by the unknown nonperturbative dynamics of strong interactions at large distances .",
    "thus , conclusions about the nature of the multiple parton radiation in the polarized hadronic collisions can not be inferred from the unpolarized case , and an additional study is required to estimate the spin dependence of such radiation under the rhic conditions .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework for such a study .",
    "we present a complete formalism for resummation in vbp with the proton beams of an arbitrary longitudinal polarization .",
    "furthermore , we explicitly account for the decay of the vector bosons into the observed leptons , which is important because of the complicated geometry of rhic detectors .",
    "the results are derived at a one - loop level of pqcd , and the summation of large logarithms is performed with the help of the impact parameter resummation technique @xcite . the detailed discussion of this lepton - level resummation formalism in the unpolarized case can be found in ref .",
    "the theoretical results are presented for arbitrary couplings of the vector boson , which makes the results of this paper also applicable to lepton pair production mediated by photons or @xmath3 bosons .",
    "our eventual product is a numerical program for monte - carlo integration of fully differential resummed cross sections in the presence of experimental cuts . in the accompanying paper @xcite , we present numerical results for the single - spin asymmetries in @xmath8 boson production and estimate the sensitivity of these asymmetries to different models of polarized pdfs .    to review the already available literature",
    ", we note that the finite - order asymmetries of order @xmath16 in the drell - yan process are currently available for distributions in full lepton pair momentum @xcite , invariant mass @xcite , and rapidity @xcite .",
    "analogous distributions for @xmath8 boson production were published in refs .",
    "recently , the @xmath17 fully differential distributions of the drell - yan pairs were obtained in ref .",
    "furthermore , refs.@xmath18@xcite presented the @xmath16 resummed single- and double - spin cross sections in the narrow width approximation , and the @xmath16 sudakov factor was explicitly demonstrated to be independent from the polarization of the proton beams .",
    "note that most of the above publications ( with the exception of the forward - backward asymmetry in ref .",
    "@xcite and polar angle distribution of the drell - yan leptons in the lab frame in ref .",
    "@xcite ) discuss the behavior of the whole lepton pair , rather than the distributions of the individual leptons .    in this paper , we go beyond the previous results in several aspects .",
    "first , we present the fully differential finite - order and resummed cross sections for the decaying electroweak vector bosons , i.e. _ , _ we completely account for the spin correlations between the hadronic subsystem and leptonic final state . in other words ,",
    "the cross sections in this work are fully differential in the individual lepton momenta , rather than in the momentum of the lepton pair .",
    "these cross sections are implemented in a monte - carlo integration program .",
    "such lepton - level analysis requires calculation of several additional angular structure functions , which do not contribute in the narrow width approximation .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0 resummation is needed not only for the parity - conserving angular function @xmath19 , which contributes to the boson - level cross section , but also for the parity - violating angular function @xmath20 , which affects the angular distributions of the decay products .",
    "the calculation for the parity - violating term @xmath20 is substantially more complex , because it involves a large number of @xmath21 matrices ( and levi - civita tensors ) coming from both spin projection operators and axial couplings of the electroweak lagrangian .",
    "in contrast , the parity - conserving term @xmath19 depends on @xmath21 matrices and levi - civita tensors from the spin projection operators only .",
    "it is well known that special care is needed to deal with the @xmath21 matrices in @xmath22 dimensions . in order to tackle this issue efficiently , we have evaluated the @xmath23-dimensional cross sections using the dimensional reduction method @xcite .",
    "we then converted our results to the conventional @xmath24 factorization scheme , which utilizes dimensional regularization @xcite . from our calculation",
    ", we have found that the spin - dependent resummed cross - sections in @xcite could not be used with the existing parametrizations of the polarized pdfs in the @xmath24 scheme , due to the different factorization scheme used in those papers .",
    "in addition , ref.@xmath18@xcite has used an unconventional normalization for the @xmath23-dimensional single - spin cross section in the @xmath25 channel .",
    "the present work has paid a special attention to rectify those inconsistencies and obtain the hard cross sections compatible with the existing phenomenological pdf parametrizations in the @xmath24 scheme .",
    "the paper has the following structure . in section  [ sec : notations ] , we introduce the notations for the kinematical variables and spin - dependent cross sections . section  [ sec : dreganddred ] discusses the regularization of cross section singularities by continuation of observables to @xmath22 dimensions , as well as the treatment of the @xmath21 matrices . in section",
    "[ sec : xsec ] , we present in detail the @xmath16 finite - order and resummed cross sections . section  [ sec : summary ] contains the summary of our results and conclusions .",
    "the appendix contains the expressions for all structure functions that contribute to the lepton - level @xmath16 cross sections .",
    "we discuss inclusive production of a lepton pair @xmath26 mediated by a virtual vector boson @xmath27 .",
    "our notations for the particle momenta and helicities in this process are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : momenta ]",

    "we have@xmath30 where @xmath31 is the component of the momentum @xmath28 that is orthogonal ( in the relativistic sense ) to the momenta @xmath32 and @xmath33:@xmath34 for any vector @xmath35 , the `` plus '' and",

    "these contributions lead to non - vanishing single - spin asymmetries at @xmath68 in the lepton distributions in the parity - conserving case @xcite .",

    "it will be shown below that the structure functions @xmath72",
    "@xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75 are generated by the vector part of the electroweak current .",
    "on the other hand , the structure functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 are generated by the axial part of the electroweak current .",
    "this feature leads to the following important consequence . when the cross section is integrated over the complete solid angle @xmath78 of the lepton decay ( as , e.g. , in the calculation of a boson - level cross section ) , all angular functions except @xmath79 are integrated out .",
    "the resulting cross section is sensitive only to the vector part of the electroweak current , so that , for instance , the @xmath8 boson cross section can be straightforwardly derived from the drell - yan pair cross section . on the other hand , if one is interested in the angular distributions of the final - state leptons , the axial part of the electroweak current can not be ignored . in that case",
    ", additional care is needed in the calculation of the parity - violating structure functions @xmath76 and @xmath80 which are affected by the @xmath21 matrices from both the spin projection operators and electroweak couplings .",
    "we now introduce the special notations that will allow us to write the cross sections for arbitrary proton polarizations in a compact form .",
