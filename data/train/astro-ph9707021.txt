    "in pure n - body as well as gravitational / hydrodynamical , particle - based simulations the gravitational field of the individual particles is commonly softened , primarily to suppress effects of two - body gravitational interactions - see , e.g. , evrard ( 1988 ) , hernquist & katz ( 1989 ) , sommer - larsen , vedel & hellsten ( 1996 , paper i in the following ) .",
    "in paper i we demonstrated that one has to be cautious when comparing results of such simulations with reality when gravity has been softened .",
    "this was illustrated by considering , as an example , non - rotating , self - gravitating , isothermal spheres in hydrostatic equillibrium showing that by introducing gravitational softening the structure of such isothermal spheres can be dramatically changed relative to the newtonian case .",
    "this occurs , in qualitative terms , when the radial extent of the spheres is less than or of the order the gravitational softening length , @xmath1 ( in paper i as well as in this paper the one - parameter spline softening proposed by hernquist & katz ( 1989 ) is used ) .",
    "it also follows from paper i that for isothermal spheres of a given mass and temperature the size increases with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , for isothermal spheres of characteristic scale @xmath2 ( and given mass and temperature ) it follows from paper i that @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    "we study the global structure of self - gravitating disks in centrifugal equillibrium for softened gravity .",
    "we show that if the characteristic size @xmath0 of the disks is less than or of the order @xmath1 , then the size of the disks is significantly larger than for the newtonian case for a given mass and angular momentum .",
    "we also show that if the characteristic size of the disk @xmath2 then @xmath3 ( for a given mass and specific angular momentum distribution with mass ) .    in section 2",
    "we describe the effects of gravitational softening on the global structure of self - gravitating disks and discuss the results obtained . finally section 3 constitutes the conclusion .",
    "the surface density of a stellar , galactic disk is in general well approximated by a truncated exponential ( e.g. freeman 1970 , van der kruit 1987 ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the central surface density ,",
    "@xmath7 the exponential scale length , @xmath8 the truncation radius ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 the radial coordinate in the plane of the disk . consider first , for a given mass and angular momentum , the one - parameter family of self - gravitating , infinitely flat disks in centrifugal equillibrium described by eq .",
    "[ 1 ] ( with @xmath11 ) for various values of the gravitational softening length @xmath1 . as @xmath1 increases and the gravitational field of the disk becomes",
    "increasingly softened one would expect @xmath7 to increase ( for a given mass and angular momentum ) and hence the characteristic cross section of the disk @xmath12 compared to the newtonian gravity value @xmath13 - in eq . [ 2 ] @xmath14 denotes the mass weighted average of @xmath15 . in figure 1",
    "@xmath16 is shown as a function of the characteristic size of the disk @xmath17 in units of @xmath1 . as can be seen from the figure , when the characteristic size of the disk is equal to the gravitational softening length",
    ", @xmath18 is about five times larger than @xmath13 due to the effect of gravitational softening . for @xmath19",
    "this ratio has increased further to about two orders of magnitude . in the limit @xmath20 , @xmath21 , as can be easily verified .    clearly , gravitational / hydrodynamical simulations where self - gravitating disks of size comparable to or smaller than the gravitational softening length occur have to be interpreted with care .    in the simple calculations above the mass and angular momentum was assumed fixed , but clearly the specific angular momentum distribution , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the cumulative mass within radius @xmath10 , changes with @xmath1 . indeed , for newtonian gravity and a given self - gravitating disk in centrifugal equillibrium with surface density @xmath24=0 ) and corresponding specific angular momentum distribution @xmath22 , a disk solution @xmath25 with the same mass and @xmath22 does not necessarily exist for softened gravity with a given non - zero softening length @xmath1 .    for a disk with surface density given by eq .",
    "[ 1 ] for newtonian gravity ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath11 ) we were able to obtain disk solutions @xmath25 with the same mass and @xmath22 for @xmath28 using a numerical , iterative algorithm .",
    "the solutions are shown in figure 2 as @xmath29 as a function of @xmath30 ( see below ) for @xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath16 are plotted in figure 1 as filled circles for @xmath32 .    for @xmath33 no solutions",
    "could be obtained - we comment further on this below .      by an argument similar to the one given in paper",
    "i it can be shown that for a system of linear size less than about half the gravitational softening length the gravitational acceleration at @xmath34 is approximately linear in r : @xmath35 where @xmath36 @xmath37 being the gravitational constant and @xmath38 the total mass of the disk . in this limit",
    "it is possible to obtain a disk solution @xmath25 given a disk @xmath39 with a corresponding @xmath22 :    by definition @xmath40 where the circular speed at @xmath10 is given by ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) @xmath41 ~ j_1(kr ) k dk \\right ] ^{1/2 } \\;\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xmath44 are bessel functions of the first kind , and @xmath45 for later use @xmath46 \\;\\;.\\ ] ]    now , in the linear approximation ( assuming @xmath47 ) @xmath48 so @xmath49 and @xmath50 hence @xmath51 where , by eq .",
    "[ 10 ] , @xmath52 given a @xmath39 eqs .",
    "[ 6]-[8 ] , [ 12 ] and [ 13 ] can be used to determine the corresponding @xmath25 .",
    "it is easy to show that the solutions are self - similar : @xmath53    for @xmath39 given by eq .",
    "[ 1 ] , @xmath54 as a function of @xmath30 is shown in figure 2 as a solid line .",
    "the solutions obtained previously for @xmath31 , as displayed in figure 2 , converge towards this limiting solution as @xmath55 , as expected .    given that in the linear approximation a solution @xmath25 with the same mass and specific angular momentum distribution as the newtonian disk @xmath39 can be obtained ( eq . [ 12 ] ) it is not surprising that such solutions in general can be obtained for @xmath56 less than some critical value .",
    "but , as described in the previous subsection , one should not expect to be able to obtain such solutions for all values of @xmath56 .    in the simplified tree - sph galaxy formation simulations described in paper i self - gravitating",
    ", quasi - isothermal gas systems of characteristic size @xmath2 occur at @xmath57 = 3.2 gyr in three , otherwise identical , simulations with @xmath1 = 1.5 , 3.0 and 6.0 kpc respectively .",
    "as discussed in paper i the systems become increasingly pressure supported relative to rotational support as @xmath1 increases .    for systems of equal mass and temperature",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "[ 29 ] and [ 31 ] of paper i that one would expect @xmath4 for pressure supported systems .",
    "likewise it follows from eq .",
    "[ 14 ] above that for rotationally supported systems of equal mass and @xmath22 one would expect @xmath3 . in figure 3 we have plotted the half - mass radii of the most massive , self - gravitating system at @xmath57 = 3.2 gyr in the three simulations as a function of @xmath1 . as can be seen from this figure @xmath58 increases approximately as @xmath59 as @xmath1 increases from 1.5 to 3.0 kpc and approximately as @xmath60 as @xmath1 increases further from 3.0 to 6.0 kpc in good agreement with the increasing degree of pressure support found in paper i.",
    "in hydrodynamical / gravitational simulations involving gravitational softening an adverse effect of the softening is to make simulated , self - gravitating disks artificially large by a significant factor if the characteristic size , @xmath0 , of the simulated disks is less than or comparable to the gravitational softening length , @xmath1 . in such cases",
    "the outcome of the simulations should be interpreted with due care .    if @xmath2 then the scaling relation @xmath3 holds for disks with a given mass and specific angular momentum distribution @xmath22 .",
