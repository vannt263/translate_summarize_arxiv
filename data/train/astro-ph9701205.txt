    "brown dwarfs ( bds ) are stellar - like objects .",
    "the only difference from ordinary stars is that the mass is too low to bring up the central temperature to the level of stable hydrogen burning , thus the bd luminosity decreases with time . as an example , from 70 myr to 10 gyr , a 0.08 @xmath4 object at the hydrogen burning limit would decrease a factor 15 in luminosity , while a 0.06 @xmath4 would go a factor 700 ( burrows et al .",
    "the ideal target for a bd search thus is a fairly young , nearby and rich star cluster .",
    "the pleiades is the obvious choice in the northern hemisphere , being at @xmath7 pc and 70 - 120 myr old .",
    "several recent authors have proposed an age above 100 myr . in this paper",
    "120 myr is adopted .",
    "the mean distance modulus of the cluster used is 5.53 ( see basri et al .",
    "1996 for a discussion ) .    whether bds could be",
    "a significant part of the local dark matter is a subject of controversy .",
    "several recent photometric surveys have found a significant drop in the luminosity function from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , leading to a turnover in the initial mass function ( imf , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 = mass ; @xmath12 = imf - index ) ) at @xmath13 0.3 @xmath4 ( see e.g. gould et al .",
    "1996 ; tinney 1993 ) or a continued rise towards the hydrogen burning limit ( see e.g. kirkpatrick et al .",
    "1994 ) depending on the choice of mass - luminosity relation .",
    "kroupa ( 1995 ) showed that the difference between the nearby stellar luminosity function ( lf ) , measured by parallax and the more distant lf , measured by photometry alone , can be explained by undetected binary companions in the distant sample . from a recently derived mass - luminosity relation ( chabrier et al .",
    "1996 ) and the well - known photometric lf ( see e.g. gould et al .",
    "1996 ) , mera et al .",
    "( 1996 ) concluded that the imf for low mass stars continues to rise to the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "however the number of known field stars at the low mass end of the main sequence is small . to clearify this item",
    "it is necessary to discover more low mass stars and bds , preferrably at a known distance and age .    in  2 ,",
    "observations , reductions and a short discussion on photometry and completeness limits is given . in ",
    "3 , the extraction of pleiades members is described .",
    " 4 discusses contamination and overall observing strategy . in ",
    "5 the implications of this paper on the imf - index is discussed and compared to other authors .",
    "all observations for this program were obtained at the 2.56 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) , la palma .",
    "the observed area covers 180 @xmath0 in @xmath14 and is centred at ra @xmath15 , dec @xmath16 ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 data was taken with brocam1 ( tek1k ) , operated in cassegrain focus with 0.176``/pixel and 3x3 field . for future proper motion measurements , the astrometry errors due to nonuninform pixels and possible effects of rotator position",
    "were reduced by using four different position angles for each i - field ( 0 , 90 , 180 and 270 degrees ) exposing 5 min at each position .",
    "debiassing and flatfield corrections were done in a standard fashion within iraf ( image reuction and analysis facility ) .",
    "median seeing was @xmath17 '' , varying from 0.46 `` to 0.80 '' .",
    "the @xmath18 observations were done with the arnica nicmos3 ( 256x256 ) array , which was made available at not via a collaboration with arcetri astrophysical observatory , florence .",
    "the last third of 6 nights in aug - sep95 was used .",
    "unfortunately the pixel size ( 0.55 \" ) was not very well matched to the seeing ( @xmath19 ) and all images were undersampled .",
    "another problem was that focus changed across the field , which due to astigmatism in the not optics led to stars of slightly different elongation across the field .",
    "apparently this was caused by the chip not being perpendicular to the optical axis which could be seen as a slight change in pixel scale across the field .",
    "the @xmath2 data could be treated the same way as @xmath1 , but high and rapidly varying background in @xmath3 necessitated a different approach .",
    "the sky for each @xmath3-image was defined as the median of the four images nearest in time and subtracted from the image , which then was flatfielded by a differential flat .",
    "a major problem in this kind of survey is to distinguish stars from distant galaxies at faint magnitudes .",
    "the whole area was visually inspected and all objects were classified as stars , galaxies , binaries or unclassifiable ( too faint for a meaningful classification ) .",
    "1411 objects out of 3800 were classified as stars .",
    "since the seeing conditions were excellent it is estimated that the discrimination between stars and galaxies is reliable to @xmath20 .",
    "since point spread functions ( psfs ) were undersampled in @xmath18 it was not suitable to use ordinary psf fitting .",
    "for single aperture photometry it is necessary to always keep the same aperture radius .",
    "however for the @xmath18 data centering errors and focus shifts are non - negligible , thus in order to maximize the signal to noise ratio it was desirable to change aperture radius from one object to another . a new , more robust , method ( used also in @xmath1 )",
    "was developed , brief outlines :    1 .",
    "all objects were measured in a series of 80 apertures , with radii ranging from 0.05 `` to 4 '' in steps of 0.05 \" .",
    "2 .   from the `` best '' stars in each field a growth curve ( stetson 1990 ) was constructed , i.e. magnitude shift as function of aperture radius .",
    "each objects curve was subtracted by that frames growth curve .",
    "ideally this curve is completely flat , but due to centering errors , errors in the sky level etc ... that is generally not the case .",
    "however , there is normally an almost flat part of the curve at @xmath21 fwhm .",
    "the magnitude difference was taken as the mean level of that part .",
    "the advantage with this method is that the right mean level will be found even if objects are differently focussed or elongated as compared to the reference growth curve .",
    "transformation of @xmath18 instrument magnitudes to the cit system was done by observations of ir standard stars and transformation equations provided by the arnica team ( hunt et al .",
    "@xmath1 instrument magnitudes were transformed to the kron - cousins system via observations of landolt ( 1992 ) standard stars .",
    "typical internal errors are 0.1 mag ( @xmath22 ; @xmath23 ; @xmath24 ) and 0.02 mag ( @xmath25 ; @xmath26 ; @xmath27 ) .",
    "the zeropoint errors are @xmath130.05 mag in j and @xmath130.08 mag in k. in i they are estimated to be less than 0.02 mag .",
    "zeropoint errors are not included in table 1 and table 3 .",
    "all objects recognized as binaries or stars very close to a galaxy in @xmath1 were , as a check , also measured by psf - fitting . for a few objects that were resolved in @xmath1 , but not in @xmath18 , the whole system was measured as one object in all bands , thus getting the binary system correct in the colour magnitude diagrams .      in this kind of surveys",
    "it is important to know the magnitude limit to which the survey is complete .",
    "the number of detected stars as a function of magnitude increases exponentially and gives a straight line in a log(@xmath28 ) vs mag plot as long as the survey is complete .",
    "the point at which the curve turns away from the straight line should be regarded as the completeness limit .",
    "thus @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the completeness limits of this survey ( magnitude error @xmath13 0.08 mag ) .",
    "the 50 % limit is @xmath13 0.7 mag fainter .",
    "several different kinds of errors define the zone of potential pleiades members in the colour magnitude diagram .",
    "the maximum error in the absolute magnitude of a single pleiades member is not likely to exceed 0.2 mag because of uncertainty of its distance .",
    "the photometric error for @xmath32 is less than 0.1 mag . for binaries ,",
    "the worst case is considered .",
    "two identical companions get 0.75 mag brighter than a single star of the same colour .",
    "therefore the bright edge is raised by 0.75 mag .",
    "the age of the pleiades is also a source of error .",
    "basri et al .",
    "( 1996 ) argue that the age is @xmath13 115 myr while the `` canonical '' age deduced from the upper main sequence turn - off is 75 myr . to account for the worst possible case ,",
    "the 70 myr sequence -1.05 mag defines the bright limit , and the 120 myr model + 0.30 mag defines the faint limit .",
    "an extension of the model colours in chabrier et al .",
    "( 1996 ) based on the brett ( 1995 ) models was kindly provided by plez ( 1996 ) .",
    "next generation models from allard et al .",
    "( 1996 ) were also included .",
    "both models show excellent agreement with the data ( fig . 1 & 2 ) .",
    "note the clear gap between the background field stars and the pleiades sequence and that all previously known members within the field were detected with this technique .      as shown in fig . 1 & 2 , 6 objects in the sample ( @xmath33 ) can be regarded as potential cluster members ( table 1 ) . of these",
    ", 5 were previously known as proper motion members ( hambley et al .",
    "1993 ; rebolo et al .",
    "the new candidate ( not1 ) is very close to a much brighter star , discovered only as a consequence of the excellent seeing conditions during the observations . a finding chart and coordinates of not1 are given in fig .",
    "its colours and magnitude indicate a binary of equally sized components , each of @xmath34 , slightly heavier than ppl15 ( basri et al .",
    "it is , however , also consistent with being a foreground m - dwarf ( see sect .",

    "magnitude errors are internal . + [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the lf from gould et al .",
    "( 1996 ) was used to estimate the number of foreground m - dwarfs for @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "thus it is not likely , although possible , that not1 is a foreground m - dwarf .",
    "since late m - dwarfs are presumed to be rare , it is interesting that a few candidates turn up in this survey , see table 3 .",
    "both not2 and not3 appear quite close to the pleiades zone in fig .",
    "2 . could they be low mass pleiades bds ?",
    "not3 was in a part of the field that was also covered by jameson & skillen ( 1989 ) .",
    "it was found in their original data , however far too faint for astrometry of sufficiently high accuracy for a proper motion measurement .",
    "not2 and not3 will though be observed in future runs .",
    "+ towards this part of the pleiades the total reddening is @xmath37 mag ( stauffer & hartmann 1987 ) , which corresponds to @xmath38 mag ( cardelli et al .",
    "thus if these stars really are m - dwarfs , @xmath39 is less than 0.1 mag even for the most distant candidate and does not affect classification significantly .",
    "our goal was not to cover as large an area as possible , but to reach very faint magnitudes in order to investigate the presence of a population of low mass bds in the pleiades .",
    "this survey is complete to @xmath40 , corresponding to 0.035 @xmath4 ( 120 myr ) or 0.01 @xmath4 ( 70 myr ) . in fig .",
    "3 , lfs from recent surveys are compared to lfs deduced from 4 different imf - indices .    it is clear from previous surveys that an imf - index close to or even above 0 is favored at least down to @xmath41 .",
    "this survey , complete to @xmath29 in the pleiades domain , one magnitude fainter than any previous survey does not give one single object below @xmath42 .",
    "thus @xmath43 ( simons & becklin 1992 ) can be rejected with 99.8% confidence , @xmath44 with 96.9% .",
    "corresponding figures for @xmath45 is 75.1% and for @xmath46 45.0% .",
    "the final conclusion is that if low mass bds ( @xmath47 @xmath4 ) exist in the pleiades , they follow an imf with index less steep than @xmath45 , and can not comprise a very large part of the cluster s mass .      allard f. , alexander d.r . , hauschildt p.h . ,",
