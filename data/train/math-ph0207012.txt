    "the thermodynamics of droplets in systems with phase coexistence has been well understood since the pioneering works  @xcite .",
    "recently , justifications of the classic results based on the first principles of statistical mechanics have been attempted  in both two  @xcite and higher  @xcite dimensions  and various thermodynamical predictions concerning macroscopic shapes have been rigorously established . however , the _ formation _ and _ dissolution _ of equilibrium droplets is among the less well - studied areas in statistical mechanics .",
    "indeed , most of the aforementioned analysis has focused on the situation implicitly assumed in the classical derivations ; namely , that the scale of the droplet is comparable with the scale of the system . as is known  @xcite , this will not be the case when the parameter values are such that a droplet first forms . in this letter",
    ", we underscore the region of the system parameters that is critical for the formation / dissolution of droplets .",
    "in particular , we isolate the mechanism by which the low - density phase copes with an excess of particles and pinpoint the critical amount of extra particles needed to cause a droplet to appear .",
    "surprisingly , at the point of droplet formation , only a certain fraction of the excess goes into the droplet ; the rest is absorbed by the bulk .",
    "moreover , apart from a natural rescaling to dimensionless parameters , all of the above can be described in terms of universal quantities independent of the system particulars and the temperature .    in the last few years , there has been some interest in questions related to droplet formation and dissolution with purported applicability in diverse areas such as nuclear fragmentation  @xcite and the stability of adatom islands on crystal surfaces  @xcite .",
    "another issue , which is of practical significance in statistical mechanics , concerns the detection of first - order phase transitions by the study of small systems with fixed order parameter ( magnetization ) or fixed energy . under these conditions ,",
    "non - convexities appear in the finite - volume thermodynamic functions ( which , of course , must vanish in the thermodynamic limit ) , see  @xcite .",
    "naturally , this suggests the formation of a droplet in a system with coexisting phases .",
    "several studies have directly addressed the issues surrounding the appearance of droplets with intriguing reports on finite - size characteristics  @xcite .",
    "we believe that the results of this letter may shed some light in these situations .",
    "we will start with some general considerations which bolster the claims of the first paragraph and , at the end of this letter , describe the principal steps of a rigorous proof for the  2d ising lattice gas .",
    "although the natural setting for these problems is the canonical distribution in finite volume , intuition is often better developed in the context of finite subsystems using the language of the grandcanonical ensemble . here the occurrence of droplets may be regarded as a problem in large deviation theory .",
    "this perspective will guide our heuristic analysis as it did in the proof for the 2d  ising  system .    consider a generic liquid - vapor system .",
    "( in this letter , we adopt , for concreteness , the language of the liquid - vapor transition",
    ". however , all considerations apply equally well to the formation / dissolution of an equlibrium crystal against a liquid or gaseous background . )",
    "first , suppose that the system is in the gaseous phase . according to a fluctuation - dissipation analysis , the local fluctuations for subsystems of volume @xmath6 are then of the order @xmath7 , where , modulo constants , @xmath8 is the isothermal compressibility .",
    "more precisely , the probability of observing a particle excess @xmath1 is given by @xmath9 now , when @xmath10 , the above is just the leading - order asymptotic of a full - fledged gaussian ( central limit ) distribution , which comes equipped with power - law corrections , etc .",
    "moreover  in the single phase regime  the above leading order remains valid even for @xmath11 , provided that @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the gas density .    in the two - phase regime , small excesses can be again absorbed into background fluctuations but , in addition , a second mechanism exists through which the system can handle an excess of particles ; namely , the formation of liquid - phase droplets .",
    "the minimal cost of a droplet of volume @xmath14 goes as @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the ( surface ) free energy of an ideal - shape droplet of unit volume . for an isotropic system , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is",
    "the surface tension and @xmath19 is the surface area of the unit sphere in  @xmath20 . in general , @xmath16 is obtained by minimizing the wulff functional  @xcite . as noted already in @xcite , by isoperimetric inequalities , scenarios involving multiple macroscopic droplets are far less likely .    now",
    "the number of _ excess _",
    "particles @xmath1 in a droplet of  volume @xmath14 is just @xmath21 , where @xmath13 and @xmath22 are the ambient gas and liquid densities , respectively .",
    "thus ,  comparing eqs .",
    "( [ gauss ] ) and  ( [ wulff ] ) , the droplet mechanism dominates when @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , while the fluctuation mechanism dominates when @xmath25 .",
    "we note that , from the perspective of rigorous analysis , significant progress has been made in the single - phase regime and in the above - mentioned extreme cases of the two - phase regime . for the ising model ,",
    "this was done for low temperatures in the exhaustive paper  @xcite , while  @xcite extended this result throughout the coexistence region in the case @xmath26 .",
    "previously , the crossover region @xmath27 has not received adequate attention . to study this region",
    ", we introduce the appropriate dimensionless parameter @xmath28 and investigate finite ( but large ) size systems as @xmath29 varies .",
    "the key to the whole picture is that , for the entire range of @xmath29 , there is a forbidden interval of droplet sizes . to be precise ,",
    "let us categorize droplets according to their surface area : we will say a droplet is of _ intermediate _ size if its surface area is large compared with @xmath30 but small compared with @xmath31",
    ". droplets with surface areas outside this range will be called _",
    "large _ and _ small _ as appropriate .",
    "we will show that , with overwhelming probability , there are no intermediate droplets .",
    "we begin with some observations : suppose we specify the amount of excess which goes into intermediate and large scale droplets and fix the location of these droplets .",
    "then , throughout the rest of the system , the fluctuations - dissipation result in eq .",
    "( [ gauss ] ) is valid , at least to leading order .",
    "indeed , the only obstructions to gaussian - type bulk fluctuations are : ( 1 )  the appearance of droplets beyond the logarithmic scale , which we have already separated for a special treatment , and ( 2 )  an exorbitant surface to volume ratio . since @xmath32 ( i.e. , @xmath33 )",
    ", the second possibility does not occur .",
    "let @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the amount of excess particles in large droplets , and similarly for @xmath36 and @xmath37 . by eq .  ( [ gauss ] ) , the distribution of the excess given in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) has a cost @xmath38 for the fluctuation part .",
    "the cost of intermediate droplets will be of the order of their combined surface .",
    "if there are  @xmath39 such droplets , then isoperimetric reasoning forces us to pay at least @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a constant of order unity . on the other hand , if all of @xmath36 were to go into small scale fluctuations , we would simply have to pay @xmath42 .",
    "comparing the two mechanisms we find , using @xmath43 and @xmath44 , that @xmath45 whenever @xmath46 .",
    "hence , the probability of even a single droplet of the intermediate scale is utterly negligible .",
    "having established the absence of intermediate - scale droplets , isoperimetric inequalities rule out the possibility of more than one large droplet .",
    "thus , we are down to the simplest possible scenario : there is ( at most ) a single large droplet in the system  the cost of which is governed by eq .",
    "( [ wulff])absorbing some of the excess , while the rest goes into background fluctuations  which are described by eq .",
    "( [ gauss ] ) .",
    "thus , the probability that the droplet contains the fraction @xmath47 of the excess particles is , in the leading order , given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is defined by @xmath50 in particular , with overwhelming probability , the fraction of excess particles taken by the droplet corresponds to a value of  @xmath47 that minimizes @xmath49 .",
    "the result of a straightforward computation is that there is a constant @xmath51 , given by the expression @xmath52 which separates two types of behavior : for  @xmath53 , the unique global minimizer of @xmath49 is @xmath54 , while for @xmath55 , the unique global minimum of @xmath56 occurs at a non - trivial value @xmath57 , see fig .",
    "moreover , the quantity @xmath58 increases monotonically with @xmath29 and the value of @xmath58 at @xmath59 , denoted by @xmath60 , can be computed exactly ; @xmath61 in particular , we have @xmath62 for all @xmath63 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "let us interpret the results in the context of the canonical distribution : the region @xmath53 minimized by @xmath64 is the remnant of the `` phase '' @xmath65 ; the entire excess is taken up by background fluctuations . for @xmath55 ,",
    "a large droplet occurs which absorbs the fraction @xmath58 of the particle excess .",
    "although this is obviously a precursor to the droplet - dominated `` phase '' ( where @xmath66 ) , the physics is somewhat different since a finite fraction of the excess ",
    "namely @xmath67 particles  is still handled by the background .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath58 and @xmath29 are related via a simple algebraic equation .",
    "the system - specific details and dependence on external parameters are encoded into the factor @xmath68 from eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) ; the dimensionless parameter  @xmath58 is a _",
    "universal _ function of @xmath29 .",
    "we remark that in  @xcite , similar conclusions had been reached by various circuitous routes under the mantel of specialized assumptions or approximations . in this note",
    ", the exact formula has been derived on the basis of simple - minded droplet / fluctuation - dissipation arguments , all of which can be rigorously proved in at least one case .",
    "in the context of the two dimensional ising lattice gas , the above reasoning has been elevated to the status of a mathematical theorem , which for convenience we state in the language of the equivalent spin system .",
    "consider the square - lattice ising model with the ( formal ) hamiltonian @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 denotes a nearest - neighbor pair .",
    "for each inverse temperature @xmath72 , let @xmath73 be the spontaneous magnetization , @xmath74 the magnetic susceptibility , and @xmath75 be the minimal value of the wulff functional for droplets of unit volume .",
    "as is well known , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 once @xmath79 .",
    "consider now an @xmath80 square in @xmath81 denoted by @xmath82 and let  @xmath83 be the overall magnetization in @xmath82 .",
    "let @xmath84 be such that @xmath85 is an allowed value of  @xmath86 for all  @xmath87 .",
    "let @xmath88 be the canonical distribution on  @xmath82 with plus boundary conditions , inverse temperature  @xmath72 , and  @xmath86 fixed to the value @xmath85 . in the present setting , the parameter @xmath29 in  eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) becomes @xmath89 where we presume that the limit exists .    in ising systems ,",
    "a convenient description for the spin configurations is in terms of their peierls contours , i.e. , the lines separating spins of opposite type ; see fig .",
    "moreover , in the present context , the boundaries of droplets are exactly these contour lines .",
    "our first claim concerns the absence of contours of intermediate size , regardless of the value of  @xmath29 .",

    "( [ delta])eq .",
    "( [ bound ] ) .",
    "the above theorem is far and away the most difficult part of the mathematical analysis .",
    "notwithstanding , the flow of the proof parallels closely the derivation that was given here .",
    "the reader may have noticed that , in the present derivation , we have not used in any obvious way the lower bound defining the scale of intermediate droplets .",
    "the issue is somewhat delicate since some log - scale droplets will naturally emerge from the background fluctuations .",
    "the constant @xmath97 must be chosen large in order to enforce the distinction between `` natural '' and `` unnatural '' as well as to control the translation entropy of the purported intermediate droplets .",
    "our next goal is to specify the typical configurations in measure @xmath88 depending on the value  @xmath29 as compared with  @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath98 be the event that there is _ no contour @xmath93 in  @xmath82 _ with @xmath99 .",

    "when @xmath59 , in ( almost ) every configuration we must have either a single large droplet or no droplet at all ; i.e. , the outcome must mimic the case @xmath55 or @xmath53 .",
    "it is conceivable that one outcome dominates all configurations or that both outcomes are possible depending on auxiliary conditions .",
    "our last statement concerns the decay of the probability ( in the grandcanonical distribution ) that the overall magnetization takes value @xmath85 .",

    "first we reduce the problem to the study of large - deviation properties of the `` grandcanonical '' distribution @xmath108 using the relation @xmath111 valid for all events @xmath112 .",
    "the next technical step is then a proof of the large - deviation lower bound @xmath113 which is produced by forcing in a contour of the appropriate size and evaluating the contributions from surface tension and bulk fluctuations . here @xmath114 as @xmath115 , uniformly in  @xmath47 .",
