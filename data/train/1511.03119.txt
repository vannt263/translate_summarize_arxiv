    "superconductivity is one of most attractive topics in condensed matter physics area not only because of the great application potential of those superconductors ( scs ) with high transition temperature and critical field but also due to the importance of understanding the mechanism of cooper pairing , especially for the unconventional superconductivity beyond bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) mechanism . according to the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory , the value of gl parameter @xmath4 which is the ratio of penetration depth to coherence length classifies scs into two categories : type - i scs when @xmath5 and type - ii scs when @xmath6.@xcite for most of superconducting compounds , they belong to the type - ii scs and have been studied extensively .",
    "in contrast , type - i scs are thought empirically to occur mainly in elementary metals and metalloids and type - i superconducting compounds are very rare.@xcite recently , however , serval binary and ternary compounds are found to be type - i scs , for instance , ybsb@xmath0,@xcite tasi@xmath0,@xcite lapd@xmath0ge@xmath0,@xcite larh@xmath0si@xmath0,@xcite ( lu , y , la)pd@xmath0si@xmath0,@xcite larhsi@xmath7,@xcite ag@xmath8pb@xmath0o@xmath9,@xcite scga@xmath7 and luga@xmath7.@xcite these studies break the empirical relation between type - i superconductivity and elemental metals and enlarge the family of type - i scs to binary and ternary compounds .    for the binary bismuth compounds , some of them show superconductivity , such as kbi@xmath0(3.6 k),@xcite srbi@xmath7 ( 5.62 k),@xcite babi@xmath7 ( 5.69 k),@xcite rh@xmath7bi@xmath10 ( 2.94 k),@xcite and in@xmath0bi ( 5.9 k).@xcite for kbi@xmath0 , except superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 , the studies on its physical properties are scarce and its classification of superconductivity has not been identified yet.@xcite in this work , we performed the detailed characterization and analysis of physical properties for kbi@xmath0 single crystals in superconducting and normal states .",
    "experimental and theoretical calculation results undoubtedly indicate that kbi@xmath0 is a type - i sc in the dirty limit . as far as we know ,",
    "this is the first type - i sc in the bismuth compounds .",
    "single crystals of kbi@xmath0 were grown by the flux method with k : bi = 1 : 9 molar ratio .",
    "k pieces ( 99.9 @xmath11 ) and bi shot ( 99.9 @xmath11 ) were mixed and put into an alumina crucible , covered with quartz wool and then sealed into the quartz tube with partial pressure of argon .",

    "the kinetic energy cutoff of the plane - wave basis was set to be 350 ev . a supercell containing 2 k atoms and 4 bi atoms and a @xmath18 k - point mesh for the brillouin zone sampling were employed .",
    "the gaussian smearing with a width of 0.05 ev was used around the fermi surface . in structure optimization ,",
    "both cell parameters and internal atomic positions were allowed to relax until the forces were smaller than 0.01 ev /  .",

    "k atoms arrange in a diamond lattice which is intertwined with the network of bi tetrahedra . on the other hand , it can be seen that there are two - dimensional ( 2d ) kagom nets of bi atoms in the ( 111 ) plane ( fig .",

    "the xrd pattern of a kbi@xmath0 single crystal indicates that the surface of crystal is parallel to the ( 111 ) plane ( fig .",

    "it can be seen that kbi@xmath0 exhibits metallic behavior and the curve @xmath27 is convex above 25 k , with a tendency to saturate at high temperature .",
    "this is a typical shape of resistivity for the sample in which the dominant scattering mechanism is electron - phonon scattering .",
    "the residual resistivity ratio ( rrr ) , defined as @xmath28(300 k)/@xmath28(4 k ) , is about 72.5 , indicating the high quality of single crystal . on the other hand , at zero field",

    "the transition temperature is consistent with previous magnetic susceptibility measurement ( @xmath31 3.5 k).@xcite moreover , with increasing magnetic field , the superconducting transition shifts to lower temperatures gradually and the transition width also becomes wider for @xmath32 ( 111 ) ( fig .",
    "surprisingly , at very low field ( @xmath33 200 oe ) , the @xmath1 has been suppressed below 2 k.     = @xmath34/(1-@xmath35@xmath36 ) scaled by 4@xmath37 at @xmath33 10 oe with zfc and fc modes .",

    "3(a ) , low - temperature magnetic susceptibility of kbi@xmath0 single crystal for @xmath41 ( 111 ) with @xmath33 10 oe exhibits diamagnetic signals with sharp transitions appearing at @xmath29 3.517 k ( @xmath42 0.10 k ) for both the zero field cooling ( zfc ) and field cooling ( fc ) modes .",
    "this superconducting transition temperature is almost same as that obtained from transport measurement , confirming the superconducting ground state of kbi@xmath0 . after considering the demagnetization effect of sample by using the formula @xmath43 where @xmath35 is demagnetization factor and the calculated value is about 0.222,@xcite",
    "the superconducting volume fraction estimated from the zfc data is very close to 100 % , indicating that the bulk superconductivity in kbi@xmath0 .",
    "meanwhile , the large superconducting volume fraction for fc data suggests the flux pinning effect is rather weak or even absent .",
    "further increasing field suppresses the @xmath1 gradually and when @xmath33 175 oe , the normal states behavior persists down to 2 k , similar to the trend in @xmath27 curves ( fig .",

    "it can be seen that the magnetic fields corresponding to the maximum absolute values of magnetic moment are very close to those where @xmath44 become zero .",
    "based on this , two different assumptions can be made : either ( i ) kbi@xmath0 is a type - ii sc that the upper critical field @xmath46 is very small and close to the lower critical field @xmath47 ; or ( ii ) kbi@xmath0 is a type - i sc and the departure from the ideal step - like transition at critical field may be attributed to a strong pinning of domain walls in the intermediate state or to unclear demagnetization.@xmath48 for the latter case , the critical field @xmath49 is defined as the field where the sample enters to the normal state ( @xmath50 0 ) . on the other hand , when temperature decreases , the critical field shifts to higher field . even at the lowest measuring temperature ( 2 k ) , however , the critical field is still remarkably small ( @xmath51 160 oe ) .",
    "the full magnetization loop of kbi@xmath0 measured at 2 k for @xmath41 ( 111 ) is shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the hysteresis is very small .",

    "specific heats of kbi@xmath0 single crystal at various fields are shown in fig .",
    "at zero field , there is a jump at 3.573 k , indicating the bulk superconductivity of kbi@xmath0 .",
    "the transition temperature is also consistent with the @xmath1 obtained from resistivity and magnetization measurements .",
    "more importantly , the specific - heat jump at superconducting transition at @xmath33 7 oe is much sharper and higher than that at zero field , which is a unique feature of type - i scs and indicates that there is a crossover from second- to first - order phase transition when field is applied .",
    "this behavior has been observed in other type - i intermetallic scs , such as ybsb@xmath0,@xcite larhsi@xmath7,@xcite scga@xmath7 and luga@xmath7,@xcite therefore , specific heat measurement further supports that the kbi@xmath0 is a type - i sc . on the other hand , the superconducting transition shifts to lower temperature with increasing field and the superconductivity",
    "is suppressed below 2.2 k when @xmath55 157 oe . in the normal state ( @xmath56 307 oe ) , the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath57 and phonon specific heat coefficient @xmath58 are obtained using the linear fit @xmath59 .",

    "the extracted electronic specific heat jump at @xmath1 ( @xmath76 6.06 ) is much larger than the weakly coupled bcs value 1.43 , indicating the strongly coupled superconductivity in kbi@xmath0.@xcite    the thermodynamic critical field @xmath77 can be obtained by integrating the differences of specific heats and the specific heats divided by temperature between the zero - field superconducting ( s ) and normal ( n ) states ( @xmath33 207 oe ) ( free energy analysis),@xcite",
