    "the superconformal approach to supergravity in the form employed in @xcite is described in detail in the recent book by freedman and van proeyen @xcite , where one can find also the references to the original work .",
    "the most surprising result of our recent investigation is the existence of a new universality class of models of chaotic ( super)conformal inflation @xcite .",
    "the new class of models found in @xcite allows inflation even if the scalar potential is very steep in terms of the original conformal variables : inflationary potential becomes exponentially flat upon switching to canonically normalized field variables in the einstein frame . in terms of the observational data",

    "yet another class of superconformal cosmological attractors with closely related predictions was recently found in @xcite .",
    "one may wonder whether these results may apply to the theories with non - minimal interaction of the scalar field to gravity described by the term @xmath11 with @xmath12 , for the case when @xmath0 differs from the conformal coupling @xmath13 .",
    "ideally , one may try to implement this program in the context of ( super)conformal theories , as we did before , but in this paper we will limit ourselves to a simpler task : we will investigate generalized models with @xmath12 directly in the jordan and einstein frame .",
    "we will show that the models belonging to this new class also exhibit attractor behavior . with even a slight increase of @xmath2 from @xmath3 , predictions of these models for @xmath4 and @xmath5 rapidly converge to their universal model - independent values ( [ attractor ] ) corresponding to conformal coupling @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , we will show that in the leading approximation in @xmath8 these values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 coincide with the corresponding values in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "one should note , that there is another class of models which exhibit a similar behavior , and leads to similar predictions : the models with potentials @xmath14 of a scalar field coupled to gravity with @xmath15 @xcite and their supersymmetric generalizations @xcite .",
    "the difference between these models with @xmath16 and the models with @xmath12 studied in our paper is that the predictions of our new class of models with @xmath12 are stable with respect to very strong modifications of the theory in the jordan frame .    in section 2",
    "we will describe the structure of the new class of models with spontaneously broken conformal symmetry , following @xcite , and then in section 2 we will extend our results for the general coupling @xmath17 .",

    "the main reason for doing this exercise was to show that the somewhat unusual term @xmath27 , or similar terms which will appear later in our paper , are essentially the placeholders to what will eventually look like a cosmological constant in the einstein frame . the theories to be studied below are based on the idea that one can develop an interesting class of inflationary models by modifying this placeholder , i.e. by locally deforming the would - be cosmological constant . that is what we are going to do now .",

    "introducing a function @xmath31 is the only possibility to keep local conformal symmetry ( [ conf ] ) and to deform the @xmath19 symmetry .",

    "we already found the same attractor behavior for the broad class of models with conformal coupling @xmath6 , so let us try to understand what happens in the large @xmath83 limit , @xmath84 .",
    "non - minimal coupling of the field @xmath39 can be ignored as long as @xmath85 . however ,",
    "the total number of e - foldings in the simplest model @xmath77 minimally coupled to gravity is n = ^24  , so the value of the field @xmath39 corresponding to @xmath50 is @xmath86 . in this case",
    "one can ignore non - minimal coupling only if @xmath87 . in the opposite limit",
    ", @xmath88 , inflation mostly occurs near the boundary of the moduli space , where @xmath89 . in this limit ,",
    "equation ( [ field2 ] ) for @xmath90 acquires a particularly simple form : [ field3 ] = 6 ||1-||^2  .",
    "the solution of this equation is ^2 = 1|| ( 1-e^- )  .",
    "thus potentials originating from the function @xmath91 lead to a family of inflationary potentials v ( ) ~(1-e^-)^n  . as explained in @xcite , all such potentials lead to the same observational predictions , which coincide with predictions in the first order in the inverse number of e - foldings @xmath8 with prediction of the large class of theories with conformal coupling @xmath92 .    under certain conditions ,",
    "inflation may occur in the regime @xmath89 even for @xmath87 .",
    "indeed , let us look again at fig .",
    "[ stretch ] .",
    "if the potential is very steep in the original jordan frame variables , then one can have inflation only because of the stretching of the potential which occurs due to conversion to canonically normalized variable @xmath22 near the boundary of the moduli space with @xmath89 .",
    "thus we are arriving to a rather interesting conclusion , which should be valid for generic potentials in the theories studied in @xcite and in our paper : if inflation can not happen in the central part of the moduli space because of the steepness of the potential in terms of the field @xmath39 , it can happen only near the boundary of the moduli space , where inflationary predictions are robust and model - independent .",
    "in other words , we have a rather paradoxical situation : the more complicated and steep the potentials look in terms of the field @xmath39 , the faster their inflationary predictions converge to the universal attractor point @xmath75 , @xmath47 shown in figure [ tmodelfig3 ] .",
    "this paper would be incomplete without mentioning another type of cosmological attractors which was found some time ago in a very similar context @xcite .",
    "let us look again at the jordan frame theory ( [ toy2a ] ) , and instead of the last term consider the simplest higgs potential @xmath93 .",
    "then the einstein frame potential as a function of @xmath39 for @xmath94 will be v ( ) = 4  ( ^2-v^2)^2(1-||^2)^2= 4 ^ 2  ( ^2-v^2)^2(^2 - 1||)^2 one can consider two limiting cases here .",
    "for @xmath95 , this will be the usual higgs potential , whereas for @xmath96 , this potential once again would represent a cosmological constant , just like in the theory ( [ chaotic ] ) with @xmath97 .",
    "something interesting happens in the limiting case where @xmath98 , where @xmath99 .",
    "if @xmath100 is small enough , the potential remain almost constant for a broad range of @xmath39 , the narrow minimum of the higgs potential appears in an immediate vicinity of the boundary of the moduli space",
    ". therefore one can use equation ( [ field3 ] ) for investigation of stretching of the potential near the minimum of the potential . as a result ,",
    "if one studies parameters @xmath101 and @xmath5 as a function of @xmath100 , one finds that for sufficiently small @xmath100 the values of these parameters once again approach the attractor values ( [ attractor ] ) .",
    "this result , which is valid for any of @xmath94 in the limit when @xmath102 and @xmath103 nearly coincide , was obtained in @xcite . in figure [ tmodelfig4 ]",
    "we present the results of @xcite superposed with the planck data .    0.5 cm   and @xmath5 in the higgs model @xmath93 for @xmath104 with quadratic and quartic potentials as a function of the parameter @xmath0 in the interval from @xmath67 to @xmath105 , for the number of e - foldings @xmath50 .",
    "the upper ( green ) line corresponds to the case @xmath72 .",
    "it grows up when @xmath106 increases . in the limit @xmath107 , it reaches the point corresponding to the theory @xmath77 @xcite . as we see",
    ", this line comes closer to the center of the domain favored by planck than the curves corresponding to natural inflation .",
    "the lower line corresponds to @xmath108 . in the limit when @xmath102 approaches @xmath103 ,",
    "all curves reach the same attractor point ( [ attractor ] ) shown by a blue star.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "in this paper we described a new class of inflationary models which exhibits the same cosmological attractor mechanism as the broad class of models based on spontaneously broken conformal and superconformal invariance discovered in @xcite .",
