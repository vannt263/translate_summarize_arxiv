    "in the limit of massless @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 quarks , the qcd lagrangian exhibits a global @xmath6 symmetry which is assumed to be spontaneously broken to @xmath7 , thus giving rise to eight pseudoscalar goldstone bosons which transform under @xmath7 as an octet .",
    "the lightest pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath8 ) are commonly identified with these goldstone bosons ; their finite masses result from an explicit chiral symmetry breaking in the qcd lagrangian due to the finite masses of the light quarks .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) [ 1,2 ] provides a systematic framework for describing the interactions of these effective degrees of freedom at low energies .",
    "it is based on a description in terms of the most general , effective lagrangian consistent with the symmetries of the underlying theory , namely , qcd . in the meson sector , the effective lagrangian of chpt is organized as a sum of terms with an increasing number of covariant derivatives and quark mass terms , @xmath9 where the subscripts refer to the order in the momentum expansion . a systematic analysis of feynman diagrams evaluated with the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ lmeson ] ) is made possible by weinberg s power counting scheme [ 1 ] .",
    "the lowest - order lagrangian @xmath10 corresponds to a nonlinear @xmath11 model with a coupling to external sources .",
    "besides the quark masses , it contains two parameters , namely , the pion decay constant in the chiral limit , @xmath12 , and a constant @xmath13 related to the quark condensate .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath14 was determined and studied by gasser and leutwyler [ 2 ] . in the @xmath15 sector",
    "it involves 10 low - energy constants , some of which have infinite pieces required to compensate infinities resulting from one - loop diagrams with vertices of @xmath10 . in addition , at @xmath2 one has the wess - zumino - witten action [ 3 ] which accounts for the chiral anomaly of qcd but does not introduce a new parameter . for strong and electromagnetic processes involving an odd number of goldstone bosons , the wess - zumino - witten term provides the leading - order contribution .",
    "at @xmath16 the effective lagrangian involves 111 terms of even and 32 terms of odd intrinsic parity [ 4 ] .    ever since the sixties the interactions of goldstone bosons with baryons have been described in terms of tree - level diagrams derived from effective chiral lagrangians .",
    "a consistent power counting , and thus a systematic treatment of higher - order corrections has become possible within the framework of the heavy - baryon formulation of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "for example , the pion - nucleon interaction in the one - nucleon sector can be described in terms of the most general effective lagrangian [ 5 ] @xmath17 where the individual pieces contain 1 , 7 , and 24 low - energy constants , respectively . in particular , the constants of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 lagrangians are scale - independent , i.e. , they are not needed to absorb infinities of loop diagrams . for a review concerning the status of chpt in the one - nucleon sector",
    "the reader is referred to [ 6 ] .",
    "according to [ 7 ] , the @xmath20 width is @xmath21 , and the main decay modes are given by @xmath22 ( @xmath23% ) , @xmath24 ( @xmath25% ) , @xmath26 ( @xmath27% ) , and @xmath28 ( @xmath29% ) , where the branching fractions @xmath30 are given in parentheses .",
    "in particular , all other decays appear with a fraction of less than a percent . with an anticipated number of @xmath31 etas per year at da@xmath0ne",
    ", it will be possible to investigate some of the rare decays .",
    "for example , for the mode @xmath32 , so far there exists only an upper limit @xmath33 [ 7 ] , whereas for the corresponding neutral mode no information is available .    we have performed an exploratory investigation of the rare decay modes @xmath1 within the framework of chiral perturbation theory [ 8 ] . at lowest order in the momentum expansion , the invariant amplitude has been calculated using the lagrangian @xmath34,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 contains the relevant goldstone bosons as well as the singlet eta . in eq .",
    "( [ leppgg ] ) we have included only those terms which actually contribute at @xmath2 . in particular , we have not included @xmath14 of gasser and leutwyler , since in an electromagnetic process involving an odd number of goldstone bosons it will only contribute at @xmath16 .",
    "= 5.6 cm = 6.0 cm    furthermore , terms of the wzw action which are irrelevant for our purposes have been omitted . for the decay constants we use @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the covariant derivative @xmath39 $ ] in @xmath10 contains a coupling to the electromagnetic field , where @xmath40 is the quark - charge matrix .",
    "the quark masses are contained in @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "finally , @xmath43 mixing is taken into account by using a phenomenological mixing angle @xmath44 : @xmath45 is shown as a function of an energy cut @xmath46 in @xmath47 around @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the invariant energy squared of the di - photon system . at lowest order , the decay rate is completely dominated by the @xmath50 pole contribution . using a more realistic strength for the @xmath51 vertex than predicted by @xmath10 leads to an enhancement of the decay rate @xmath52 of about a factor four . furthermore , as was shown in [ 9 ] , the inclusion of chiral pion loops at @xmath16 leads to a notable enhancement of the decay rate .",
    "in particular , in the di - photon spectrum for large values of @xmath49 , these contributions even dominate the @xmath50-pole contribution .",
    "the @xmath20-pole contribution on the other hand is negligible . in fig .  1 ( right ) the partial decay rate @xmath53 is shown as a function of an energy cut @xmath54 around the bremsstrahlung singularity at @xmath55 .",
    "the long - dashed line represents the @xmath2 calculation , whereas the dashed line results from a calculation including vector mesons [ 10 ] .",
    "the strong enhancement indicates that @xmath16 counter terms may be important .",
    "the role of loops still has to be investigated .",
    "an investigation of the virtual compton scattering amplitude which , e.g , enters the physical process @xmath56 , has recently attracted a lot of interest .",
    "even though the experiments will be considerably more complicated than for real compton scattering , there is the prospect of obtaining completely new information about the structure of the nucleon which can not be obtained from any other experiment . in particular , as a prerequisite for studying this new structure information it is important to identify the model - independent properties of the vcs amplitude .    omitting the bethe - heitler contribution",
    ", the invariant amplitude for vcs reads @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the polarization vector of the virtual photon , and where we made use of current conservation . in the center - of - mass system , using the coulomb gauge for the final real photon , the transverse and longitudinal parts of @xmath59 can be expressed in terms of eight and four independent structures , respectively , @xmath60 where the functions @xmath61 depend on the three kinematical variables @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "model - independent predictions for the functions @xmath61 , based on lorentz invariance , gauge invariance , crossing symmetry , and the discrete symmetries were obtained in [ 11 ] .",
    "for example , the result for @xmath65 up to second order in the momenta @xmath62 and @xmath63 reads @xmath66 to this order , all funtions @xmath61 can be expressed in terms of known quantities , namely , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "a systematic analysis of the structure - dependent terms specific to vcs was first performed in [ 12 ] .",
    "the non - pole terms were expressed in terms of three spin - independent and seven spin - dependent generalized polarizabilities which were introduced in the framework of a multipole analysis , restricted to first order in @xmath63 , but for arbitrary @xmath62 .    a calculation of the spin - independent polarizabilities in the framework of the linear @xmath11 model [ 13 ] led to the surprising result that only two of the three polarizabilities were , in fact , independent .",
    "that this is not a model - dependent statement could be shown in [ 14 ] , where the reduction from three to two polarizabilities was traced back to a combination of invariance with respect to charge conjugation and nucleon crossing .",
    "a similar reduction from seven to four terms occurs for the spin - dependent polarizabilities .",
    "the generalizations of the spin - independent polarizabilities @xmath74 and @xmath75 have been calculated in various frameworks [ 12,13,15,16 ] and are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "in particular , chiral perturbation theory at @xmath76 predicts [ 16 ] @xmath77,\\quad \\beta(|\\vec{q}|)=\\beta_0\\left[1+\\frac{1}{5}\\frac{|\\vec{q}|^2}{m^2_\\pi } + o\\left(\\frac{|\\vec{q}|^4}{m^4_\\pi}\\right)\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the results for the real compton scattering polarizabilities at @xmath76 [ 6 ] which compare remarkably well with the experimental numbers @xmath80 and @xmath81 [ 7 ] .",
