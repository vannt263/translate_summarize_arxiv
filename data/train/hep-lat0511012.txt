    "recent discoveries at rhic point to the inadequacy of using a weakly coupled plasma description for the deconfined phase of qcd ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) . instead , properties of collective flow , can be described very well with ideal hydrodynamics , which suggests that the phase is in fact strongly interacting .",
    "related to these are theoretical studies in the framework of lattice qcd , which found signs of these strong interactions .",
    "these include a large deficit in thermodynamical bulk properties , such as pressure , entropy , and energy density , with respect to their free gas values , up to temperatures of a few times the transition temperature @xmath4 @xcite . @xcite . ]",
    "these deficits were found in the pure @xmath2 gauge theory , as well as with different types of fermions .",
    "the deficit in all these cases is quite similar , and is hard to reproduce with standard perturbation theory .",
    "this is in contrast to the fermionic addition to the pressure at a small , nonzero , chemical potential , which is explained very well by perturbation theory ( for example @xcite and references thererin ) .",
    "the analytical approaches used to study this phenomenon include quasi - particle models , polyakov loop models , variants of perturbation theory , models of loosely bound states , gravity dual models , and also perturbative small volume calculations of the large-@xmath3 gauge theory . some of these approaches simplify or even become soluble at the ",
    "t hooft limit of large-@xmath3 , which is a free theory in the confined phase ( at least in the mesonic sector ) , and consists of only planar diagrams in a perturbative expansion of the deconfined phase .",
    "an additional important point here is that , provided the chiral limit is taken after the large-@xmath3 limit , the planar pure gauge theory is effectively quenched ( for example see @xcite ) .",
    "this makes any calculation in the pure gauge case relevant for the physical case , that includes fermions .",
    "the simplifications of the planar limit , together with the possibility that the pressure deficit is ` hidden ' in the gluonic sector , and the need to check and constraint the analytical explanations , lead us to study bulk thermodynamical properties of @xmath5 , and @xmath6 pure lattice gauge theories and compare to the study by boyd et al . of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "recent calculations of various properties of @xmath0 gauge theories @xcite@xcite have demonstrated that @xmath7 is very close to @xmath8 for most purposes .",
    "these also provide information on the transition coupling for various lattice sizes and @xmath3 .",
    "thus our calculations should provide us with an accurate picture of what happens to bulk thermodynamics at @xmath8 . for a more detailed version of this work , which was conducted with dr .",
    "m.  teper , we refer to @xcite .",
    "we define the gauge theory on a discretised periodic euclidean four dimensional space - time with @xmath9 sites , and perform monte - carlo simulations of a simple wilson action .",
    "we use the kennedy - pendelton heat bath algorithm for the link updates , followed by five over - relaxations of all the @xmath10 subgroups of @xmath0 . to evaluate bulk thermodynamics",
    "there are several approaches one can use .",
    "the `` differential method '' was used in the past , and is known to produce the unphysical result of a negative pressure close to @xmath4 .",
    "the reason for that is the use of a perturbative beta function in a regime where the coupling is not small . in our case ,",
    "larger values of @xmath3 drive us to smaller values of @xmath11 , and therefore to a lattice spacing of @xmath12- too coarse for the differential method .",
    "an additional possibility is the use of a direct evaluation of the density of states .",
    "unfortunately , modern methods like the wang - landau algorithm did not converge for the case of @xmath6 .",
    "this leaves us with the `` integral method '' ( see for example @xcite ) in which the pressure @xmath13 and interaction measure @xmath14 are @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the plaquette average on a @xmath17 lattice with @xmath18 , while @xmath19 is measured on a lattice with relatively large @xmath20 .",
    "let us mention that in the expression for the pressure in we dropped the pressure at temperature @xmath21 corresponding to @xmath22 . to justify this one usually takes @xmath22 much lower than the transition coupling @xmath23 , which means that the systematic error will be very small .",
    "we performed calculations of @xmath24 in @xmath5 on @xmath25 lattices and in @xmath6 on @xmath26 lattices for a range of @xmath27 values corresponding to @xmath28 $ ] for @xmath5 , and to @xmath29 $ ] for @xmath6 .",
    "since we use @xmath11 , while the data for @xmath2 in @xcite is for @xmath30 , we also performed simulations for @xmath2 on @xmath31 lattices with @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "the measured plaquette averages are presented in @xcite .",
    "we performed the ` @xmath33 ' calculations of @xmath34 on @xmath35 lattices for su(3 ) , and on @xmath36 lattices for su(4 ) , which are known to be effectively at @xmath33 @xcite for the couplings involved . for su(8 ) however , using @xmath37 lattices would not be adequate for the largest @xmath27-values , and we take instead the su(8 ) calculations on larger lattices in @xcite , and interpolate between the values of @xmath27 used there with the ansatz @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the lattice perturbative result to @xmath40 from @xcite and @xmath7 .",
    "our best fit has @xmath41 with @xmath42 , and the best fit parameters are @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and a gluon condensate of @xmath45 .",
    "for @xmath1 , one is able to use lattice volumes much smaller than what one needs for @xmath2 ( like those in @xcite ) as the longest correlation length decreases rapidly with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this is also theoretically expected , much more generally , as @xmath46 ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the main remaining concern has to do with tunneling configurations , which occur only at @xmath4 when @xmath47 . on our finite volumes , this is no longer true , and we minimise finite-@xmath48 corrections by calculating the average plaquettes only in field configurations that are confining , for @xmath49 , or deconfining , for @xmath50 . for su(3 ) , where the phase transition is only weakly first order , it is not practical to attempt to separate phases . this will smear the apparent variation of the pressure across @xmath4 in the case of su(3 ) .    to confirm that our finite volume effects are under control",
    "we have compared the su(8 ) value of @xmath51 as measured in the deconfined phase of the our @xmath52 lattice with other @xmath53 results from other studies @xcite , and find that the results are consistent at the @xmath54 sigma level . we perform a similar check for the confined phase on the same lattices , and again find that finite volume effects are small , mostly on a one sigma level .",
    "a similar check for the confined phase on @xmath55 lattices leads to conclude that a size @xmath56 in su(8 ) is not large enough , as we find that the plaquette average has a significant change ( on a @xmath57 sigma level ) from @xmath56 to @xmath58 for our largest value of @xmath27 .",
    "by contrast , for @xmath5 the finite volume effects seem not to be large on the @xmath36 lattice as we checked for our largest value of @xmath59 .",
    "there the value of the plaquette on a @xmath35 lattice is consistent within @xmath60 sigma with the value on a @xmath36 lattice .",
    "the data supporting these checks , together with the checks related to the next paragraph , is presented in @xcite .",
    "to evaluate the scaling of the temperature @xmath61 with the coupling @xmath62 , and the derivative in , we use calculations of the string tension , @xmath63 , in lattice units ( e.g. @xcite ) . a more natural scale here is the transition temperature @xmath4 .",
    "however this involves a calculation of the transition coupling @xmath23 for many values of @xmath64 , and for several values of @xmath65 , which is a very large scale project . also the difference between this scale fixing and the one according to @xmath63 comes from the @xmath66 corrections of @xmath67 .",
    "a check of the latter for @xmath68 shows that @xmath67 for @xmath69 , are the same within the errors .",
    "indeed when we compare @xmath70 from @xcite , and as determined here for @xmath71 , we find that they fall on top of each other .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath5 , but there the @xmath72 difference in @xmath67 of @xmath11 , and @xmath73 is only at the level of @xmath74 . as a result we may slightly overestimate @xmath75 when it is @xmath76 for this @xmath77 . finally the value of @xmath78 for the different gauge groups and @xmath11 in taken from @xcite .    in presenting our results for the pressure , we shall normalize to the lattice stephan - boltzmann result given by @xmath79 here @xmath80 includes the effects of discretization errors in the integral method @xcite . the same normalisation is applied for the interaction measure @xmath14 , and for the energy density @xmath81 , and entropy density @xmath82 .    to check that we understand the systematics of finite lattice spacing corrections when presenting the normalized results , we compare @xmath83 for @xmath2 with @xmath84 from @xcite , @xmath11 from the current study ( in both these cases @xmath61",
    "was increased by increasing @xmath27 ) , and @xmath85 from @xcite ( where @xmath61 was increased by decreasing @xmath64 ) .",
    "the result of the comparison is presented in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where one indeed sees that the normalization by the stephan - boltzmann free gas shows a systematic increase of @xmath14 towards the continuum limit .     for @xmath71 ( on the left ) , and @xmath86 ( on the right ) normalized to the lattice stephan - boltzmann pressure , including the full discretization errors given by @xmath80 .",

    "the lines are the @xmath2 results and @xmath84 from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    -0.5 cm",
    "before we present our results for the bulk thermodynamical quantities , let us note that as the ideas of reduction at large-@xmath3 ( for example see the recent systematic studies in @xcite ) have an interesting realization here . by relabeling the axes , the authors of @xcite have argued that at @xmath8 wilson loops should not change as a function of @xmath61 for @xmath49 .",
    "this will be reflected in our case in a @xmath87 which is very similar to @xmath88 .",
    "indeed when we compare the two we find that the difference is on a @xmath89 level for @xmath90 , while from the data of @xcite it is on the @xmath91 level for @xmath2 .",
    "this also means that the systematic error , ignored in is very small for the larger values of @xmath3 .",
    "all the results we present are as a function of @xmath75 .",
    "it is therefore important to note that the dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath3 is very weak , indeed like many other quantities in the pure gauge theory @xcite .",
    "we present our @xmath77 and @xmath7 results for @xmath83 in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in the former we change @xmath64",
    "so to increase @xmath61 up to @xmath92 , while in the latter @xmath61 is increased by changing @xmath27 . in both cases",
    "we find modest / small changes between the different groups .",
    "nonetheless in the vicinity of @xmath4 , the differences are large , presumably because the transition in @xmath2 is only weakly first order .",
    "normalized to the lattice stephan - boltzmann pressure , including the full discretization errors given by @xmath80 , for @xmath86 .",
    "the line are the @xmath2 results and @xmath93 from @xcite , width=268 ]    .",
    "[ fig2 ] -0.5 cm    the plot of @xmath94 is presented in the left panel of fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] we present results for the normalized energy density @xmath95 , and normalized entropy density @xmath96 .",
    "the lines are the @xmath2 result of @xcite with @xmath93 .",
    "again we see very little dependence on the gauge group , implying very similar curves for @xmath8 .    .",
    "in the pressure plot , the symbols vertical sizes are representing the largest error bars ( which are received for the highest temperature ) .",
    "the lines are the @xmath2 results and @xmath93 from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=268 ] . in the pressure plot",
    ", the symbols vertical sizes are representing the largest error bars ( which are received for the highest temperature ) .",
    "the lines are the @xmath2 results and @xmath93 from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=268 ]    -0.5 cm    one can clearly infer that the pressure in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 cases is remarkably close to that in @xmath2 and hence that the well - known pressure deficit observed in su(3 ) is in fact a property of the large-@xmath3 planar theory .",
    "this implies that the dynamics that drives the deconfined system far from its noninteracting gluon gas limit , must remain equally important in the @xmath8 planar theory .",
    "this is encouraging since this limit is simpler to approach analytically , for example using gravity duals , and also because it can serve to constraint and point to important ingredients of analytical approaches .",
    "for example , in perturbation theory , it tells us that the important contributions must be planar , and although the current calculated contributions are indeed all planar , this is not guaranteed at @xmath97 @xcite . in models focusing on resonances and bound states , it must be that the dominant states are coloured , since the contribution of colour singlets will vanish as @xmath46",
    ". models using ` quasi - particles ' should place these in colour representations that do not exclude their presence at @xmath8 , and in fact give them @xmath61-dependent properties which depend weakly on @xmath3 .",
    "also , topological fluctuations should play no role in this deficit since the evidence is that there are no topological fluctuations of any size in the deconfined phase at large-@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we are thankful to j.  engels for discussions on the discretisation errors , @xmath80 , of the free lattice gas pressure , and for giving us the numerical routines to calculate them .",
    "we also thank the workshop organizers for the opportunity to present these work .",
