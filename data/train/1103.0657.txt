    "this result is in good agreement with the previous data from t2k , minos and double chooz collaborations  @xcite , and daya bay and reno progresses have led us to accomplish the measurements of three mixing angles , @xmath8 and @xmath1 from three kinds of neutrino oscillation experiments . a combined analysis of the data coming from t2k , minos",
    ", double chooz and daya bay experiments shows  @xcite that @xmath9 or equivalently , @xmath10 at @xmath11 levels and that the hypothesis @xmath12 is now rejected at a significance level higher than @xmath13 .",
    "although neutrinos have gradually revealed their properties in various experiments since the historic super - kamiokande confirmation of neutrino oscillations  @xcite , properties related to the leptonic cp violation are completely unknown yet .",
    "in addition , the large values of the solar mixing angle @xmath14 and the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath15 may be telling us about some new symmetries of leptons not presenting in the quark sector and may provide a clue of the nature in quark - lepton physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the @xmath16 symmetry , which is the most popular discrete symmetry , has made some success in describing the masses and mixing pattern in the lepton sector  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , ma and rajasekaran  @xcite have introduced for the first time the @xmath17 flavor symmetry to avoid the mass degeneracy between @xmath18 and @xmath19 under the @xmath16 symmetry . in a well - motivated extension of the sm with the @xmath17 symmetry  @xcite",
    ", the tbm pattern of the lepton mixing matrix comes out in a natural way .",
    "models with the @xmath20 symmetry combined with grand unification  @xcite , supersymmetry  @xcite and extra dimensions  @xcite have been also investigated extensively in the literature .    on the other hand , among many possibilities proposed to understand the tiny masses of neutrinos , the most popular are the seesaw scenarios in which the light neutrino masses become small due to sufficiently large masses of newly introduced particles .",
    "there are three different types of the seesaw models :    @xmath21 type i seesaw with three heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos  @xcite ,    @xmath21 type ii seesaw where an electroweak higgs triplet is used to directly provide the left - handed neutrinos with small majorana masses  @xcite ,    @xmath21 type iii seesaw introducing @xmath22 fermion triplets with zero hypercharge  @xcite .",
    "the type i and type ii seesaw models with the @xmath20 flavor symmetry ( and an auxiliary symmetry ) have been extensively studied in the literature  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we carry out a systematic study of neutrino phenomenology in the type iii seesaw model with the @xmath20 symmetry , which is spontaneously broken at a scale much higher than the electroweak scale .",

    "we assume that there are three copies of such fermion triplets . among many interesting features  @xcite of the model",
    "are the possibility of having low seesaw scale of order a tev to realize leptogenesis  @xcite and detectable effects at lhc  @xcite through gauge interactions of the heavy triplet leptons or through relatively large mixing of the light and heavy neutrinos , and the possibility of having new tree level fcnc interactions in the lepton sector  @xcite .    by combining the @xmath20 flavor symmetry with the seesaw mechanism embedded in the type iii model",
    ", we show that the tbm pattern of the lepton mixing matrix as well as the tiny neutrino masses can be understood at tree level in our framework .",
    "we further investigate the possibility that all the neutrino experimental data can be accommodated in our framework through the effects from higher dimensional operators .",
    "for this goal we introduce all possible effective dimension-5 operators , invariant under @xmath24 , both in the neutrino and in the charged lepton sector .",
    "these dimension-5 operators generate the necessary off - diagonal elements of each mixing matrix induced , respectively , from the neutrino and charged lepton sectors .",
    "subsequently a deviation of the lepton mixing matrix from the tbm form is induced so that the non - zero mixing angle @xmath1  @xcite and small deviations from tbm of solar and atmospheric mixing angles can be explained through phase effects  @xcite .",
    "in the type i seesaw model , the seesaw mechanism is realized by introducing heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos ( @xmath26 ) that are singlets under the sm gauge groups  @xcite . in the type iii",
    "seesaw , the heavy majorana neutrinos in the type i seesaw are replaced by su(2)@xmath27 triplets of heavy right - handed leptons having zero hypercharge  @xcite .",
    "the component fields of the right - handed triplet @xmath28 and the corresponding left - handed one @xmath29 are @xmath30 where @xmath31 with the charge conjugate @xmath32 and @xmath33 the pauli matrix  @xcite .",
    "unless flavor symmetries are assumed , particle masses and mixings are generally undetermined in gauge theory .",
    "to understand the present neutrino oscillation data , we consider @xmath17 flavor symmetry together with an auxiliary symmetry @xmath34 for leptons .",
    "then the symmetry group for the lepton sector is @xmath35 . to impose the @xmath20 flavor symmetry on our models properly ,",
    "the higgs field sector is extended by introducing two types of new scalar fields , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , besides the usual sm higgs field @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath36 is a @xmath39 singlet and electrically neutral , but the @xmath37 is a @xmath39 doublet such as @xmath38 : @xmath40    the field assignments under @xmath41 in our models are shown in table  [ reps ] , where @xmath42   is the sm lepton doublet .",
    "here we recall that @xmath17 is the symmetry group of the tetrahedron , or equivalently , the finite group of the even permutation of four objects .",
    "it has four irreducible representations : one three - dimensional representation @xmath43 and three inequivalent one - dimensional representations @xmath44 .",
    "their multiplication rules are  @xmath45 ,  @xmath46 , @xmath47   and  @xmath48 . by denoting two @xmath20 triplets as @xmath49 and @xmath50 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a complex cubic - root of unity .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     interestingly enough , cp violating phases arise from the dimension - five operators driven by the @xmath36 field and they are directly related to the low energy dirac cp phase which can be measured , in principle , in long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite . by using the conventional parametrization of the pmns matrix  @xcite and eq .",
    "( [ pmns2 ] ) one can deduce a expression for dirac cp phase @xmath54 which can be written as @xmath55 equivalently , the strength of the low energy cp violation measurable through neutrino oscillation defined by jarlskog invariant , @xmath56 $ ] , could be expressed roughly in terms of our parameters @xmath57 the right plot of fig .

    "[ figa ] , the measured value of @xmath1 favors the region @xmath59}\\lesssim1.7 $ ] , which in turn means that @xmath4 has a non - vanishing value , indicating a signal of maximal @xmath3 violation .",
    "it is worth noting that the features discussed above can be similarly obtained also in the type i seesaw case with the @xmath0 symmetry . in the type iii seesaw case , because of their origin from the same @xmath22 triplet , the heavy neutral ( @xmath60 ) and charged ( @xmath61 ) leptons appear in the lagrangian usually on the same footing , as shown in the previous and this section .",
    "it is thus unlikely in the type iii seesaw with the @xmath0 symmetry to find sizable effects from only either @xmath60 or @xmath61 to the charged lepton mass terms or the neutrino dirac mass terms .",
    "however , the presence of the heavy charged lepton ( @xmath61 ) in the type iii case leads to unique physical consequences differentiating from those of the type i case , such as decays of @xmath61 ( through the gauge interactions given in eq .",
    "( [ charged_gauge ] ) ) and new tree level fcnc processes , which can be tested in future experiments .",
    "the seesaw mechanism is a promising way to explain the tiny masses of neutrinos , but it can not provide a solution for the puzzling pattern of mixing among different lepton flavors . an interesting approach for understanding",
    "the pattern of the mixing matrix in the lepton sector is to invoke certain family symmetries which constrain the flavor structure of couplings of yukawa interactions .    motivated by the recent neutrino data from daya bay and reno collaborations",
    ", we have studied the phenomenology of neutrino mixing angles in the type iii seesaw model with @xmath20 flavor symmetry . stating with the leptonic yukawa interactions having a @xmath62 symmetry which is spontaneously broken at a scale much higher than the ew scale , we have shown that at tree level the tbm form of the lepton mixing pmns matrix can be obtained in a natural way . from the current neutrino experimental data , either normal or inverted hierarchical case of neutrino masses is allowed , depending on the sign of a particular parameter in our analysis .    by introducing higher dimensional operators",
    ", we have explicitly shown that the lepton mixing matrix generally has a deviation from the tbm form such that it can explain the non - zero mixing angle @xmath1 indicated by recent experimental data . with negligible corrections from the charged lepton sector to the lepton mixing matrix ,",
    "our result is consistent with all the neutrino experimental bounds , such as @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 at @xmath68 level , but our prediction for the possible value of @xmath65 is disfavored by the data at @xmath69 level . in the presence of effective dimension-5 operators driven by @xmath70 singlet scalar fields we have found that sizable contributions from the charged lepton part modify the lepton mixing matrix with which all the neutrino data can be accommodated through phase effects .",
    "we have shown that although two regions on the phase @xmath58 , @xmath71}\\lesssim 1.7 $ ] and @xmath72}\\lesssim 5.1 $ ] , are allowed by the experimental data of @xmath73 , the measured value of @xmath1 favors the former .",
    "in particular , the recently measured best - fit value of @xmath2 can be understood in our framework in a consistent way with the constraints from the other mixing angles @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , we have found that the leptonic @xmath3 violation characterized by the jarlskog invariant has a non - vanishing value , indicating a signal of maximal @xmath3 violation @xmath75 , which could be tested in the future experiments such as the upcoming long baseline neutrino oscillation ones .",

    "but , the right - handed majorana neutrino term @xmath77_{{\\bf 3}_a}$ ] identically vanishes due to the property of a majorana particle .",
    "in contrast , for the heavy charged leptons , after @xmath20 symmetry breaking , the @xmath80 term leads to @xmath81 , where @xmath82      the hermitian matrices  @xmath83  ,  @xmath84  ,  @xmath85   and  @xmath86 ,   respectively , which are given by  @xcite @xmath87",

    "<S> two possible scenarios are investigated , by taking into account either negligible or sizable contributions from the light charged lepton sector to the lepton mixing matrix . </S>",
    "<S> especially it is found in the latter scenario that all the neutrino experimental data , including the recent best - fit value of @xmath2 , can be accommodated . the leptonic @xmath3 violation characterized by the jarlskog invariant @xmath4 has a non - vanishing value , indicating a signal of maximal @xmath3 violation .    </S>",
