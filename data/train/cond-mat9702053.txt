    "it is a well - known fact that nematic liquid crystals reveal a large variety of defect structures .",
    "such defects are very interesting from the theoretical point of view @xcite .",
    "moreover , they are important for applications , _ e.g. _ , they play an crucial rle in the switching mechanisms in modern liquid crystal display devices ( surface - stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal cells ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , a quantitative investigation of defect dynamics is desirable .",
    "the types of defects in the nematic director field cover zero- and one - dimensional objects ( point and line defects , respectively ) that arise due to the presence of impurities or surfaces @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional sheets , _",
    "i.e. _  walls , are unstable in an isolated nematic .",
    "they can be stabilized , however , by imposing an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the situation is similar to domain walls in a ferromagnetic material where regions of different spin orientations are separated by a thin boundary layer @xcite . in a nematic ,",
    "the director can align parallel or antiparallel to the external magnetic field . due to fact that the director `` lacks the arrowhead '' ,",
    "these two situations are energetically equivalent .",
    "it may happen , that two spatial regions of antiparallel director orientation will form , with a domain wall between them @xcite .",
    "domain walls in nematics due to the existence of an external field are static in a planar geometry @xcite .",
    "a qualitatively new behaviour occurs , when the shape of the wall is curved . in this case",
    "the wall becomes a dynamical object , _",
    "i.e. _  its core starts to move , whereas the wall width is changing .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a quantitative study of the dynamics of domain walls in a cylindrical geometry .",
    "we consider the case of director reorientation through a bloch and nel wall @xcite . from a methodological point of view , in our calculations we use the so - called _ polynomial approximation _",
    " it has turned out to be very fruitful in studies of defect dynamics in relativistic scalar field theories @xcite . due to the cylindrical symmetry",
    ", we can find explicit analytical solutions to equations of motion obtained within that approximation .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii the equation of motion for the director field is derived on the basis of the ericksen - leslie theory @xcite for the case of a cylindrical domain wall of bloch or nel type in a nematic liquid crystal .",
    "section iii develops the polynomial expansion as an analytical method to solve approximately the dynamics of the director field . within this approach ,",
    "we obtain closed expressions for the dynamics of the wall core and width . in section iv some selected results together with their discussion are presented .",
    "section v contains an outlook on possible extensions of our investigations .",
    "for all calculations we restrict ourselves to the cylindrical geometry as pointed out in figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "the cylinder axis is determined by the orientation of the external magnetic field @xmath0 which coincides with the @xmath1-axis of our coordinate frame , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath2 .",
    "( @xmath3 denotes the unit vector along @xmath1 . )",
    "as already mentioned above , a domain wall occurs for parallel and antiparallel director orientation with respect to the external field in different spatial regions . in the case of axial geometry",
    ", we assume the director to be aligned along the positive or negative @xmath1-axis ( _ up , down _ ) inside or outside the cylinder , respectively . now the director can reorient from _ up _ to _ down _ in either @xmath4plane or @xmath5plane , where @xmath6 are cylindrical coordinates .",
    "we refer to these two cases as _ bloch _ ( fig .",
    "1 ) and _ nel _ ( fig .  2 ) wall , taking over the nomenclature from planar domain walls in ferromagnetics @xcite and nematics @xcite .    for our calculations",
    "it will be advantageous to work within a comoving cylindrical coordinate frame .",
    "the radial coordinate consists of the wall radius @xmath7 and the radial distance @xmath8 from the wall .",
    "these are related to cartesian coordinates according to @xmath9 the nabla operator , expressed in the comoving coordinates , reads @xmath10 the `` spatial '' time derivative @xmath11 is related to the `` material '' ( _ i.e. _  comoving ) time derivative @xmath12 by the chain rule between the coordinate sets @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( laboratory and comoving coordinates ) : @xmath15 the relation above is simplified for cylindrical geometry @xmath16 for the bloch and nel wall we can describe the director orientation by the _ tilt angle field _ @xmath17 which measures the angle between the local director and the @xmath1-axis . in terms of the comoving frame ,",
    "the director is in the @xmath4plane for the bloch wall and in the @xmath18plane for the nel wall : @xmath19      in the framework of the ericksen - leslie theory @xcite the dynamics of the director field follows from the balance between elastic , magnetic and viscous torques .",
    "the latter are determined by the temporal change in the director , whereas elastic and magnetic torques are obtained as a variational derivative from a free energy density @xmath20 .",
    "thus the equation of motion for the director components generally reads @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ npoint ] ) @xmath22 is the rotational viscosity of the liquid crystal .",

    ", however , it turns out , that this constraint can be incorporated much more easily by starting from ( [ npoint ] ) ( _ i.e .  _ without the lagrange multiplier ) . later on we shall eliminate the variation of the length of the director by taking appropriate projections , as will be demonstrated below .    the free energy density @xmath20 consists of an elastic and a magnetic part ( @xmath26 ) . for the elastic free energy density",

    "the key idea is to take the spatial dependence of the tilt angle field @xmath17 as a taylor - like expansion with respect to the wall distance @xmath8 around its `` core '' value @xmath52 .",

    "thus from our calculations we obtain two equations that read as follows : @xmath59      next we have to incorporate the boundary conditions .",
    "these are determined by the director alignment parallel and antiparallel to the external magnetic field inside and outside the wall , respectively .",
    "the ( instantaneous ) wall thickness is given as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 measures the outward distance from the core to the outer edge of the wall , whereas @xmath62 means the core - to - edge distance towards the cylinder axis . therefore the boundary conditions read @xmath63 eqs .",

    "( [ bound2 ] ) are the conditions for the smoothness of the solution",
    ".    we can immediately express the boundary conditions in terms of the polynomial expansion for the tilt angle field ( [ poly ] ) : @xmath64 the equations above form a set of inhomogeneous linear equations for the expansion coefficients @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "the solubility conditions yield relations between the expansion coefficients and the wall partial widths @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath65 we note that the partial widths of the wall have turned out identical , and that there is no quadratic term in the polynomial expansion .",

    "the actual decay time is the moment when the cylinder radius touches the edge of the wall .",

    "@xmath91 the main feature of the bloch wall are twist deformations , whereas the nel wall rather consists of bend deformations .",

    "interestingly , the dynamics of the wall width reveals two separated processes on different time scales .",
    "first a rapid change occurs from the initial half - width to a metastable state that does not depend on the initial condition ( figs .  4 and 5 ) .",
    "the metastable half - width can be related to the magnetic coherence length @xmath92 . for",
    "planar geometry the director would reorient in an external magnetic field by a _ twist _",
    "deformation on a length scale @xcite of @xmath93 introducing the parameters given at the beginning of this section , we obtain @xmath94 m for the half - width of a planar bloch wall .",
    "however , according to figs .  4 and 5 the metastable value for the half - width of the cylindrical bloch wall is @xmath95 m .",
    "the discrepancy is due to the curvature that gives rise to additional _ bend _",
    "deformations . assuming that a similar law as eq .",
    "( [ coherence ] ) also holds for the curved wall , we can extract an effective elastic constant @xmath96 n. for the curved nel wall the coherence length ( figs .  4 and 5 ) is @xmath97 m , corresponding to an effective elastic constant of @xmath98 n. this means that the elastic energy content of cylindrical domain walls is about one order of magnitude larger for the nel geometry as compared to the bloch - like reorientation .",
    "as already stated above the effective coherence length @xmath99 or @xmath100 denotes a metastable state . after some seconds , when the cylinder has shrinked so that its radius @xmath7 is of the order @xmath61 , our solution for the wall half - width breaks down .",
    "formally , our expressions for the bloch wall reveal an implosion ( fig .",
    "6 ) , whereas for the nel wall we obtain an explosion ( fig .  7 ) of the wall width .",
    "this is due to the opposite sign of the quantity @xmath101 in ( [ m ] ) and ( [ n ] ) and thus depending on the relative magnitude of the elastic constants ( _ cf . _",
    "( [ abbr1 ] ) , ( [ abbr2 ] ) ) .",
    "actually , one should remember that for wall half - widths larger than the cylinder radius the boundary conditions ( [ bound2 ] ) are not correct , and then our solutions loose their physical meaning .",
    "thus , within the framework of the polynomial expansion we are able to study the decay of the cylindrical domain wall until its radius becomes approximately equal to its half - width .",
    "\\1 . our solutions for @xmath7 and",
    "@xmath61 give a rather detailed description of the time evolution of cylindrical domain walls .",
    "first of all , it would be interesting to compare our theoretical predictions with experimental results .",
    "furthermore , because our expressions explicitly show how the dynamics of the domain wall depends on the material constants @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , they could be useful for the determination of these constants by observing the shrinking of the cylindrical domain walls .",
    "it is possible to generalize our calculations to domain walls of a more general shapes , _",
    "e.g. _  we could allow for a modulation along the @xmath1-axis or for non - circular sections by the @xmath104-@xmath105-plane .",
    "for the relativistic scalar field theory this has been performed in the second of the references @xcite .",
    "the calculations in the general case the are much more cumbersome than for strictly cylindrical symmetry , while the main ideas of the polynomial approximation remain unchanged . for this reason we have chosen to restrict our presentation to the cylindrical geometry ."
