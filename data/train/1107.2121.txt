    "most magnetars have been discovered either from their persistent x - ray emission properties or when they enter into randomly occurring outbursts , during which they emit a multitude of short ( @xmath13 milliseconds ) , soft @xmath14/hard x@xmath15ray bursts .",

    "swift _ on 2008 august 22 , when it emitted a series of bright , soft , short bursts @xcite .",
    "the first burst also triggered the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) onboard the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope ( _ fgst _ ; hereafter _ fermi _ ) .",
    "soon after , our target of opportunity ( too ) observations with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) established a period of @xmath16 5.76 s in the persistent x - ray emission of the source @xcite .",
    "further observations with _ rxte _ and the _ swift_/x - ray telescope ( xrt ) revealed a spin - down rate of @xmath17 s s@xmath7 , indicating a dipole magnetic field of @xmath18 g @xcite .",
    "our subsequent @xmath19 too observations established an accurate location of the source at @xmath20 , @xmath21 , with an 1@xmath22 uncertainty of @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this is the first magnetar location at roughly the galactic anticenter direction , placing most likely at the perseus arm of our galaxy at @xmath24 kpc @xcite .",
    "the outburst lasted approximately 2 weeks , during which several bright bursts were detected with _ swift _ , gbm , _ rxte _ , _",

    "gbm triggered on 26 bursts ; in addition , an untriggered event search in the daily data sets revealed seven more bursts .",
    "we present here our analyses of the 29 gbm bursts from for which we have high - resolution data ; the properties of the x - ray persistent source emission have been published by @xcite and @xcite . in section [ data ] , we describe the instrument , observations and data selection . in sections [ tempo ] and [ spec ] , we present our temporal and spectral results , respectively .",
    "we discuss the interpretation of our results in section [ discussion ] .",

    "when a gbm trigger occurs , tte data are provided from @xmath27 s pre - trigger to @xmath28 s post - trigger . with its very high temporal resolution",
    "the tte datatype is most suitable for the detailed temporal and spectral analyses of very short events like sgr bursts and is , therefore , the only datatype used throughout this paper .    during the burst active period of the source ( 2008 august 22  2008",
    "september 3 ) , gbm triggered on 26 bursts .",
    "we further implemented the algorithm described in @xcite to search for any untriggered events in the daily data sets of 2008 august 21 through 2008 september 14 , and found seven individual short bursts located in the same direction as . among these only three had tte data and were , therefore , included in our analyses .",
    "two of the 29 bursts were very bright , causing saturation of the high speed science data bus ; the saturated parts of these bursts were excluded from any spectral analysis .",
    "for all spectra and durations we selected the nai detectors with an angle to the source smaller than @xmath29 to avoid attenuation effects .",
    "we also excluded any detectors blocked by the _ fermi_/large area telescope ( lat ) , or by the spacecraft radiators or solar panels .",
    "the bgo detectors were not used as there was no obvious emission in the nais above 200 kev . in columns two through four of table [ obs ] we list for each of the 29 gbm events their trigger numbers , times , and the selected nai detectors used for the following analyses .",

    "each duration was calculated between @xmath35kev with 2ms bins as follows .",
    "first we fit the burst background using two time intervals before and after each burst ( [ -2 s , -0.5 s ] and [ 0.5 s , 2 s ] ) with a first order polynomial ; these intervals were kept mostly the same for all bursts unless a precursor and/or a tail were detected .",
    "then we fit the background - subtracted , cumulative burst counts , with a linear plus a step function simultaneously ; the linear part was user - selected ( before and after the burst ) , while the step part was determined from the fit linear trend .",
    "the height of the step function was then used to represent the net total counts ( @xmath36 ) of the burst , subsequently used for the @xmath0 determination .",
    "panels a and b in figure [ duration_dis ] show the distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath30 for all 29 bursts ; all individual @xmath0 values can be found in table [ obs ] ( column 4 ) .",
    "for comparison reasons with other magnetar duration distributions ( see section 3.4 ) we fit each distribution with log - normal functions and obtained @xmath37 ms ( @xmath38 , where @xmath22 is the width of the distribution in the log - frame ) and @xmath39 ms ( @xmath40 ) .",

    "we estimate the ( max , min ) errors ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) for each @xmath0 ( similarly @xmath30 ) as : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the time when the cumulative light curve reaches _",
    "n _ counts .",
    "we then created probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) for each @xmath0 and @xmath30 , as described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "each pdf was constructed using a two - sided normal distribution , where the width of each half ( @xmath22 ) was set to the uncertainty of the duration ( @xmath47 , @xmath44 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 ) : @xmath50 each pdf describes the likelihood to obtain _ x _ ( i.e. , @xmath0 or @xmath30 ) given its measured value @xmath51 .",
    "finally , we averaged all sample pdfs to create the total pdf of @xmath0 ( @xmath30 ) shown in figure [ duration_dis ] panels ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "note that the shorter ( fainter ) events have larger errors , resulting in `` pulling '' the pdf towards shorter durations .",
    "the photon - based durations , @xmath52 , are estimated with an algorithm similar to the one used above over each burst cumulative fluence in erg @xmath6 .",
    "we used the same time resolution ( 2ms ) and energy range ( @xmath35kev ) as in the count durations . the essential difference here , is that these measurements utilize the intrinsic ( deconvolved ) burst spectra instead of the detector recorded counts to define the burst intrinsic durations independent of different instruments . to perform these estimates",
    ", we used the gbm public software tool rmfit v3.3 ( for a description of this tool see also * ? ? ? * ) and the new datatype ctte specially created to facilitate analyses of short events .",

    "is selected before and after each burst and fit with the lowest acceptable order of a polynomial to determine the background model parameters .",
    "next the entire burst interval is fit to determine the default set of photon model parameters .",
    "the model used in these fits is a power law with an exponential cutoff ( compt ; described in detail in section 4 ) .",
    "when all background and source model selections are determined for each 2ms time bin , we subtract the background , fit its spectrum using the compt model , and calculate its photon flux .",

    "the multiple narrow spikes in this figure , mostly at the long - duration end of the plot , are largely due to the fact that the corresponding errors ( in contrast to those of shorter and fainter durations ) are relatively small , yielding tall and narrow gaussian components .",
    "this is a rather high - variance estimate of the distribution function . as an alternative we show in figure [ duration_bb ] a completely different density estimate based on an adaptation of the bayesian block algorithm for histogramming of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 data , taking into account measurement errors in the independent variable @xcite .",
    "this algorithm finds the optimal piece - wise constant model to represent the data ; the optimization corresponds to the maximum likelihood for a constant - rate poisson model for the data in each of the bins .",

    "both duty cycle distributions have the same mean value of 0.68 .      the durations in photon space are estimated using the deconvolved source spectra with the response of the gbm detectors . in principle , since the spectral energies where sgr bursts emit most of their photons are relatively narrow ( @xmath74kev ) there should not be a large difference between photon and count durations .",

    "our spectroscopic fitting clearly indicates that the compt and bb+bb models yield superior fits to the other possibilities . the compt model , with its power - law shape curtailed by an exponential turnover , is intended to mock - up the classic unsaturated comptonization spectrum realized in models of accretion disks such as in cyg x-1 or in active galactic nuclei ( see chapter 7 of rybicki & lightman 1979 for a summary of its development as a solution of the kompaneets equation ) .",
    "these models use hot , thermal electrons in a corona to repeatedly scatter low - energy photons , heating them gradually up to an energy @xmath158 consistent with the electron temperature @xmath159 , at which point a quasi - exponential spectral turnover emerges as further heating becomes impossible .",
    "the power law marks the scale - independence of the compton upscattering , and its slope depends only on the mean energy gain per collision ( @xmath160 for non - relativistic electrons ) and the probability of loss of photons from the scattering zone , being expressed as @xmath161 with the compton @xmath162-parameter in the domain @xmath163 .",
    "this parameter is the product of the average fractional energy change per scattering and the mean number of scatterings , and is @xmath164 for a non - relativistic situation for repeated compton upscattering . here",
    "@xmath165 is the scattering optical depth .    in the context of magnetars ,",
    "such comptonization can also ensue , but the strong magnetic field now plays an important role .",
    "ephemeral coronae of hot electrons could be expected in a dynamic inner magnetosphere .",
    "for example , this could be due to intense dissipation of magnetic energy in the closed field line region via field line twisting , i.e. , transient departures from poloidal geometry , as in the considerations of thomson , lyutikov & kulkarni ( 2002 ) , thompson & beloborodov ( 2005 ) , beloborodov & thompson ( 2007 ) , and nobili , turolla & zane ( 2008 ) .",
    "such a pumping of energy into electrons in low altitude regions would then be subject to irradiation by the intense bath of surface x - ray emission .",
    "the electron coronae would mimic those of their black hole counterparts discussed above , and serve as a comptonization target for the x - rays .",
    "temporally , the coronae could be quite variable , resulting in varying or chaotic time profiles such as are observed .",
    "if the deposition of energy in hot electrons is persistent over many light - crossing timescales , so also can the upscattered hard x - ray emission be . in this magnetic case",
    ", the spectrum would again naturally be a power law truncated by an exponential tail , whose energy is pinned by @xmath159 .",
    "the slope does differ somewhat in value from the non - magnetic case because the presence of the intense field anisotropizes the environment .",
    "this alters the average fractional energy change per scattering from the isotropic @xmath166 form in rybicki & lightman ( 1979 ) .",
    "we note that this picture is similar to that of lyutikov & gavriil ( 2006 ; see also rea et al .",
    "2008 ) , who modeled the steep x - ray tails below 10 kev in quiescent magnetar emission using a resonant cyclotron scattering picture .    since the electrons will move along the field lines in the zeroth landau level , the exact kinematics that impact the determination of @xmath167 depend on the colatitude and altitude of the collisions",
    "therefore , the effective _ magnetic compton @xmath162-parameter _",
    ", @xmath168 , that could be substituted in eq .",
    "( [ comp_index ] ) , would take a somewhat different value from its non - magnetic cousin , but one anticipates that the range of spectral realizations would be similar to the @xmath169 case .",
    "since head - on collisions generally yield greater heating of photons , and these are more likely at lower altitudes , it is expected that interaction zones close to the stellar surface would spawn larger @xmath168 and therefore flatter photon spectra .",
    "if there were a coronal radius expansion , this would then translate to an evolutionary steepening of the spectra with time .",
    "note that the photon retention probabilities in the coronae will need to be higher than in the lyutikov & gavriil ( 2006 ) scenario to generate the requisite moderate optical depths @xmath165 to match the flat outburst spectra discussed in this paper .",
    "the scatterings will take place below the cyclotron resonance unless their altitude is above around 10 stellar radii ( e.g. lyutikov & gavriil 2006 ) .",
    "below resonance , the cross section is far inferior to the thomson value ( e.g. see herold 1979 ) .",
    "then , the coronal electron density must accordingly be much higher than when @xmath169 in order to establish a sizable optical depth .",
    "this provides a possible distinction between the two classes of magnetar emission : the steady @xmath170kev signal may originate at higher altitudes where the resonance is accessed and the local electron density is low , whereas the bursts reported here may be triggered closer to the surface in higher density zones that initially precipitate scattering below the cyclotron resonance . as photons get energized above 20 kev , the altitude where the resonance is accessed is lowered , increasing the cross section for scattering and therefore @xmath168 .",
    "note also , that to a considerable extent , polarization mode - switching ( e.g. miller 1995 ) between the two photon polarizations can help increase the opacity , adding a further nuance to consider when modeling the scattering environment .",
    "observationally , it is difficult to discern unambiguously the presence of the intense field using a comptonization model scenario in the energy range of data presented in this paper : details of both the field strength and the geometry are subsumed in a single parameter @xmath168 . since the emission in this scenario should be strongly polarized , and the degree of polarization should depend on the interaction geometry , a hard x - ray polarimeter would provide insightful probes into the presence of a strongly anisotropizing super - critical field .",
    "the dual blackbody can also be envisaged as a viable alternative from a theoretical standpoint .",
    "the moderate thomson depths required to generate flat comptonization spectra could easily be higher , thereby pushing the electron - photon interactions more towards an equilibration .",
    "the saturation temperature is then controlled by the largely uncertain total energy dissipated in the inner magnetosphere per hot electron present .",
    "since any equilibration will be non - uniform over a coronal volume , there should be a modest temperature gradient throughout , smearing out the continuum .",
    "the range of temperatures will not be great because the system is not gravitationally hydrostatic in character .",
    "moreover , radiative transfer effects impact the spectral shape and further modify it .",
    "accordingly , pure blackbody shapes are not expected .",
    "it is quite conceivable that a two - component blackbody fit may well approximate the emergent continuum that is a superposition of distorted blackbodies spanning a small range of temperatures .",
    "most probably , due to general thermodynamic considerations , the base of the coronae ( e.g. centered near the source of magnetic dissipation ) should be hotter than the outer layers ( see also lyubarsky 2002 and thompson & duncan 1995 ) .",
    "interestingly , the fits here generate a smaller volume associated with the hotter blackbody contribution , consistent with the expectation for coronal structure . yet ,",
    "somehow , we must obtain a view of the hotter zone , therefore indicating a strongly aspherical coronal geometry . modeling",
    "this semi - equilibration is a challenging task for theorists considering the influences of the field , the twisted magnetospheric geometry , and the inherent anisotropy and polarization - dependence of the scattering process . at present , it is not possible to distinguish between this thermal scenario , and a comptonization one .",
    "since the compt model fits all events , we used it to derive fluences ( time - integrated and time - resolved ) , and determined  using the time - resolved values  that the hardness - fluence correlation can be described by a broken power law , with a minimum at a fluence of @xmath171 erg @xmath6 .",
    "we have used @xmath172 values to characterize the hardness of the events in our sample .",
    "earlier studies of this correlation used hardness ratios to bypass proper spectral fits due to low quality or insufficient data . moreover , these studies @xcite had a very narrow overlap in fluence space . @xcite",
    "used 95 sgr@xmath9 events detected with the interplanetary sun earth explorer-3",
    "( isee-3 ) with fluences ranging between @xmath173 erg @xmath6 , and found a slightly positive correlation between the two quantities ( hardness increasing with fluence ) . on the other hand",

    "rxte _ , with fluences ranging between @xmath174 erg @xmath6 , and found the opposite trend ( an anticorrelation between hardness ratios and fluences ) .",
    "since the gbm data sample covers both fluence ranges ( @xmath175 erg @xmath6 ) we were able to establish that both trends are indeed correct , and to define the turning point in the @xmath172 - fluence diagram .",
    "only two magnetar candidates were observed with gbm to emit a multitude of bursts , thus allowing us to construct their @xmath172 - flux diagrams .",
    "we find for the time - resolved data of , that @xmath172 reaches a minimum of @xmath4kev at a flux value of @xmath176 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 .",
    "the second source ( sgrj@xmath8 ; van der horst et al .",
    "2011 in preparation ) has flux values of @xmath177 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 at a similar @xmath172 minimum .",
    "in addition we used the hardness ratio - count rate relationship of sgr@xmath9 found in the _ integral _ data @xcite to derive an approximate flux value of @xmath178 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 ( using their conversion from count rate to flux ) at the hardness ratio minimum ( figure 3 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we then converted these values into isotropic source luminosity , @xmath10 ( see table [ liso ] ) ; we note that ( with the caveat of small number statistics , and uncertainties in the distance measurements ) these values are comparable [ @xmath179 erg s@xmath7 ] , although the @xmath181fields and fluxes at @xmath172 minima vary by approximately a factor of ten between the two gbm sources and sgr@xmath9 .",
    "whether these differences reflect intrinsic source properties or instrumental effects is not yet clear .",
    "the @xmath172 trend is , however , clearly established in at least two different instrument data sets .",
    "the physical interpretation of this trend is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "part of our sample ( 18 bursts ) was fit with the bb+bb spectral function applied to time - integrated intervals ; the remaining 11 events could not be fit due to poor statistics .",
    "in addition for five bright events we performed time - resolved spectral analysis .",
    "we found that the temperatures , emission areas and fluences ( luminosities ) of the two thermal components exhibit very similar properties in both cases ( time - integrated and -resolved ) .",
    "our results are consistent with those presented for intermediate and short bursts from sgr @xmath79 by @xcite and @xcite ; the burst emission areas and temperatures fall into the same region with those of the short bursts of sgr @xmath79 shown in figure 5 of @xcite .",
    "we also see a similar trend in the correlation between the luminosities of the two components as described by @xcite , namely that both luminosities increase in tandem .",
    "this behavior indicates that the hot and cool bb components may come from two separate emission regions , as also pointed out by @xcite : a smaller but hotter one from the surface of the magnetar , and a larger , cooler one from the star s magnetosphere ( but see also the discussion in section 5.1 ) .",
    "we note here that the time - integrated hot bb emission area of 13 bursts ( i.e. , not including the 5 brightest events ; figure [ r2_kt ] ) is similar to the emission area ( @xmath182 km@xmath183 ) of the bb component found in the persistent emission of sgr j1550@xmath155418 during one active bursting episode in january 2009 , believed to originate from a hot spot on the neutron star surface @xcite .    finally , we performed a detailed temporal analysis of all 29 bursts and estimated their durations ( @xmath0/@xmath30 ) for the first time in count _ and _ in photon space .",
    "both estimates agree within statistics and thus validated all earlier ( count space ) duration estimates of magnetar candidate bursts .",
    "the durations ( and for four sgrs also the emission times and duty cycles ) of five magnetar candidates follow a log - normal or normal distribution .",
    "we find that events are very similar in average duration with four more magnetar candidates ( three sgrs and one axp ) .",
    "however , the @xmath0 distribution of the bursts from axp1e@xmath81 has a factor of two larger dispersion ( @xmath184 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than those of at least three other sgrs ( @xmath185 , * ? ? ?",
    "* , present work ) .",
    "bursts have an average duty cycle ( @xmath186 ) larger than other sgrs ( 0.45 , 0.46 for sgrs @xmath79 , @xmath9 , respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "the differences in the intrinsic properties of the sources may be due to differences in the size of the active region responsible for the burst emission .",
    "we discuss below the burst energetics and its evolution .",
    "similarly to other magnetars , we also do not find a correlation between the pulse phase of the source and the burst peak times .",
    "the overall behavior of during its 13-day active period ( 2008 august 22 to september 3 ) is also very interesting .",
    "although about half of the bursts ( 16/29 ) occurred on one day ( 2008 august 23 ) , most of the burst energy was emitted from the source during august @xmath187 ( see also figure [ energetic ] ) .",
    "the average fluence of the beginning and the later part of the active period was constant and at a lower level . during these three days , gbm detected seven bursts , five of which",
    "are also distinguished in that the emission areas from both bb components are the largest .",
    "further , one of these five events ( bn080824.054 ) shows a double - peaked structure reminiscent of some bright thermonuclear type i x - ray bursts from accreting neutron stars , which has been interpreted as due to photospheric radius expansion ( pre ) .",
    "@xcite studied the effects of pre in high magnetic fields using this event and find that the predicted flux from pre theory is consistent with the one observed , opening the way to determining fundamental parameters of neutron stars , such as their equation of state .",

    "<S> we also estimate for the first time event durations of soft gamma repeater ( sgr ) bursts in photon space ( i.e. , using their deconvolved spectra ) and find that these are very similar to the @xmath0s estimated in count space ( following a log - normal distribution with a mean value of @xmath2ms ) . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the time - integrated spectra for each burst and the time - resolved spectra of the five brightest bursts with several models . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a single power law with an exponential cutoff model fits all 29 bursts well , while 18 of the events can also be fit with two black body functions . </S>",
    "<S> we expand on the physical interpretation of these two models and we compare their parameters and discuss their evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the time - integrated and time - resolved spectra reveal that @xmath3 decreases with energy flux ( and fluence ) to a minimum of @xmath4kev at @xmath5 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 , increasing steadily afterwards . </S>",
    "<S> two more sources exhibit a similar trend : sgrs j@xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the isotropic luminosity , @xmath10 , corresponding to these flux values is roughly similar for all sources ( @xmath11 erg s@xmath7 ) . </S>"
