    "the transport properties of condensed matter systems are often measured by driving currents externally and measuring the resulting voltages or temperature differences . in cold atomic gas clouds , on the other hand ,",
    "transport is more often measured by setting up transient out - of - equilibrium initial conditions and measuring the subsequent relaxation towards equilibrium @xcite . in the approximation that the cloud is isolated and has an infinite lifetime ( no loss of atoms or exchange of energy with any degrees of freedom outside of the gas cloud ) , the conserved currents of interest include the energy current and currents of each of the atomic species present . in the absence of optical lattices or random potentials that violate momentum conservation , one can also ask about the transport of momentum ( viscosity ) .",
    "in this paper we consider the diffusive transport of heat and of atoms .",
    "we mostly focus on the case of a two - species fermi gas with only inter - species contact interactions , but start with a somewhat more general discussion here .",
    "the system may , in addition to diffusive transport , also have underdamped or propagating sound or other `` collective '' modes .",
    "a gas cloud in a smooth trap will have such sound modes , with the longest - wavelength sound modes being the often - discussed collective modes of the cloud s oscillations within the trap . here",
    "we consider a gas cloud in a smooth trap , with the cloud at global _",
    "mechanical _ equilibrium , so that any pressure gradients in the cloud are sufficiently balanced by trapping forces that no underdamped sound or collective modes are excited .",
    "we also assume that the cloud is everywhere near _ local _ thermodynamic equilibrium , so the local temperature @xmath0 and local chemical potentials @xmath1 can be defined .",
    "however , the cloud may still have gradients in the local temperature and in the local chemical potentials of the various species of atoms . if the equilibrium equation of state of the system is known ( for the unitary fermi gas , see @xcite ) then measurements of the local densities of each species allows these gradients of @xmath2 and the @xmath3 s to be measured .",
    "thus , for example , the local densities can be used as local thermometers to allow a measurement of the thermal diffusivity by an approach similar to that used in @xcite to measure the spin diffusivity ( but with an initial temperature gradient instead of a composition gradient ) .",
    "the transport currents that we examine in this paper are those that arise in linear response to these gradients . in a trap",
    ", convection currents may also appear in linear response , as temperature and/or composition gradients may produce density inhomogeneities , and the `` heavier '' regions of the gas cloud will sink towards the bottom of the trap while the `` lighter '' regions rise .",
    "these convection currents are damped by the viscosity .",
    "convection will be strongest in wide clouds and should be much weaker in high - aspect - ratio clouds with the gradients in @xmath2 and the @xmath3 s oriented along the long axis of the cloud . in most of this paper , for simplicity we consider a gas in a spatially uniform potential , so such convection currents do not appear in linear response .",
    "then mechanical equilibrium is indeed a sufficient condition to have a convectionless gas @xcite .",
    "quite generally , a temperature gradient drives a heat current and a gradient of chemical potential difference drives a composition ( `` spin '' ) current , consisting of opposing currents of the two ( or more ) atomic species .",
    "we call these `` direct '' responses to a temperature gradient and a gradient of chemical potential difference `` primary currents '' .",
    "in addition to these `` primary currents '' , there are the magnetocaloric currents , namely spin seebeck currents ( spin currents induced by a temperature gradient ) and spin peltier currents ( heat currents induced by gradients of chemical potential difference ) .",
    "these magnetocaloric effects have been one of the central research topics in the field of spintronics @xcite . the spin seebeck effect @xcite and the spin peltier effect @xcite",
    "have already been observed in condensed matter systems , while they are yet to be detected in cold atomic clouds . in this paper",
    "we discuss the origin and the physics of these effects in a cold atomic fermi gas , and estimate how large these effects can be in realistic experiments .",
    "note that ref .",
    "@xcite discusses a rather different situation that they are also calling the `` spin seebeck effect '' : they consider an unpolarized gas with the two species at different temperatures ( thus _ not _ in _ local _ equilibrium ) and a gradient in this temperature difference . also , ref .",
    "@xcite studies a different system , a `` two terminal geometry '' , considering transport through a narrow constriction between two reservoirs held at different temperatures and chemical potentials . for this constriction , they discuss `` off - diagonal '' elements in the transport matrix which they call effective seebeck and peltier effects .",
    "this paper begins with a general discussion of the two - species universal fermi gas and an introduction of transport coefficients , spin and thermal diffusivities , spin seebeck effect , and spin peltier effect .",
    "then we present rough estimates of diffusivities and determine the signs of the spin seebeck and spin peltier effects based on physical arguments . in the following section ,",
    "these qualitative descriptions are justified by approximate solutions of the boltzmann transport equation in the classical regime .",
    "we then compute experimentally verifiable signals of the spin seebeck effect .",
    "these results are tested against an exactly solvable model , namely atoms with a `` maxwellian '' scattering cross section .",
    "we also use the kubo formula to derive various general relations among the transport currents and coefficients .",
    "the various effects discussed in this paper are probably most accessible experimentally for the unitary fermi gas at temperatures of order the fermi temperature , where the diffusivities are at their smallest , so the diffusive relaxation towards equilibrium is slowest and most easily studied .",
    "we set boltzmann s constant @xmath4 but explicitly keep planck s constant @xmath5 .",
    "the universal fermi gas is a two - species fermi gas with only contact ( @xmath6-wave ) inter - species interactions that is realized to a very good approximation in recent experiments with ultracold atoms @xcite .",
    "we consider such a gas in three - dimensional space , with the two species having equal mass @xmath7 .",
    "there is no optical lattice , only a possible smooth trap potential .",
    "the interaction is specified by the scattering length @xmath8 , which can be set to any value in experiments by tuning through a feshbach resonance @xcite . for @xmath9",
    "this is the standard textbook noninteracting fermi gas , while for weakly attractive @xmath8 it is very close to the model used by bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs ) to explain superconductivity .",
    "indeed , this system shows paired - fermion superfluidity at low temperatures .",
    "the limit of infinite @xmath10 is the strongly - interacting unitary fermi gas .    as is standard , we call the majority species with number density @xmath11 `` up '' , and the minority species `` down '' , @xmath12 . the total number density @xmath13 , together with @xmath7 and @xmath5 set the characteristic length , time and energy scales",
    ". the scaled dimensionless properties of this universal fermi gas then depend on only three dimensionless parameters , which can be chosen to be @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the polarization @xmath16 .",
    "we use a convention that the fermi wavenumber and temperature @xmath17 and @xmath18 are defined by the total density , so that at high polarization @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this universal fermi gas has a variety of regimes of behavior : the polarization @xmath21 can be low or zero so @xmath22 or it can be near one so @xmath23 . the temperature can be higher , @xmath24 , or lower , @xmath25 , than both fermi temperatures or , for @xmath26 it can be in between them , @xmath27 .",
    "the scattering can be near unitarity so @xmath28 is of order one or more , or it can be far from unitarity so @xmath29 . at high @xmath2 it also matters whether @xmath10 is larger or smaller than the thermal de broglie wavelength @xmath30 .",
    "there are also important differences between the @xmath31 ( bcs side of the feshbach resonance ) and @xmath32 ( bec side ) regimes .",
    "the conservation laws of this fermi gas are : total energy ( @xmath33 ) , total momentum ( @xmath34 ) , and the total number of each of the species ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) .",
    "the viscosity measures the transport of momentum , which we mostly do not consider here .",
    "thus we consider primarily the transport of atoms and of heat . if there is a nonuniform pressure in the system that is not balanced by a trapping potential , the gas will accelerate and this will produce free motion or propagating sound waves . here",
    "we consider the diffusive spin and heat transport in a gas with no trapping potential and spatially uniform pressure @xmath37 , so it is at mechanical equilibrium .",
    "the gas is near _ local _ thermodynamic equilibrium , but with possible weak gradients in the local temperature and/or the spin polarization .",
    "a smooth trap potential may be added via the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "in general , an inhomogeneity of the fermi gas consists of gradients in the local temperature and of the local densities of the two atomic species .",
    "mechanical equilibrium imposes a constraint on these gradients and thus there are only two independent linear combinations of the three gradients .",
    "one way of describing the diffusive dynamics is in terms of the atomic densities @xmath38 and the currents @xmath39 of each species @xmath40,@xmath41 , leaving the temperature and the heat current implicit , since they are dictated by the equilibrium equation of state , e.g. , @xmath42 .",
    "this description of the transport has the virtue that it is in terms of what appears to be the most accessible local observables in experiment , namely the local densities of each species .",
    "since the system in the absence of a trapping potential is galilean - invariant , we have a certain amount of flexibility in what inertial frame we use to specify the currents . for most of this work ,",
    "we consider the frame where the center of mass of the whole cloud is at rest and let the gas have long - wavelength temperature , density and/or composition modulations , but always with a spatially uniform pressure .",
    "the diffusive currents are related to the density gradients as @xmath43    the diffusion matrix in ( 1 ) has two eigenmodes . at zero polarization ,",
    "the symmetry between @xmath44 and @xmath41 implies @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "therefore one eigenmode is odd under exchanging species , @xmath47 ; the current in this odd mode carries only spin and no net density or energy .",
    "the other eigenmode is the even mode , @xmath48 ; the current in this even mode carries both net density and energy , but no spin .",
    "away from zero polarization , when @xmath49 , we no longer have this symmetry between species .",
    "the diffusive eigenmodes are then no longer purely spin or purely not spin , instead they are mixtures , thus producing the spin seebeck and peltier effects .",
    "the eigenmode where the currents of the two species are in opposite directions we will call the `` spin '' mode with diffusivity @xmath50 , while the other mode where they are parallel we will call the `` thermal '' ( or heat ) mode with diffusivity @xmath51 .    another standard representation of the transport matrix in terms of the heat current @xmath52 and spin current @xmath53 is the following : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the thermal conductivity and @xmath56 is the spin conductivity . @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the spin seebeck and peltier coefficients , respectively , and they are related by the onsager relation , @xmath59 .",
    "this matrix explicitly shows the direct responses ( diagonal elements ) and magnetocaloric effects ( off - diagonal elements ) , and is in the form that is given by the kubo formula , as we discuss below .    the currents in ( 2 )",
    "must be defined properly so that they are the transport currents , namely the currents of heat and spin relative to the average local motion of the gas .",
    "let the local current density of atoms be @xmath60 .",
    "these atoms carry the average heat , @xmath61 , where @xmath6 is the average entropy per particle , and the average spin polarization @xmath21 .",
    "therefore the local heat and spin transport currents are @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the local energy current .",
    "since the above currents measure only the transport relative to the average motion of the gas , they are _ reference frame independent_. for more details of definitions of currents , see e.g. ref @xcite .    if the full equation of state of the system is known , then measurements of the pressure and the local densities can be converted to local temperatures and chemical potentials .",
    "but the local density @xmath64 and polarization @xmath21 are directly observable without requiring knowledge of the equation of state , so yet another convenient form of the transport equations is    @xmath65    at @xmath66 , we have @xmath67 and @xmath68 , but when @xmath69 these quantities in general differ due to the mixing between spin and heat transport .",
    "it is possible that @xmath70 is the most directly accessible version of the spin seebeck coefficient : if one can set up an initial condition at mechanical equilibrium and local thermodynamic equilibrium with a temperature gradient but no polarization gradient and then measure the resulting spin current , this is a measurement of @xmath70 and does not require knowledge of the equation of state .",
    "note that the three representations , eq .",
    "( [ diffusion ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ diffusion_tmu ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ diffusion_tp ] ) are related by the equation of state , the mechanical equilibrium condition , and definitions of spin and heat currents .",
    "hence , they are _ equivalent_.",
    "let s first present rough `` power - counting '' estimates of the spin and thermal diffusivities , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively . at the level of power -",
    "counting the differences between the various possible definitions of these diffusivities are small and are ignored here .",
    "previous work @xcite on the unpolarized gas ( @xmath66 ) shows that @xmath71 for @xmath73 is the larger of @xmath74 and @xmath75 . in the recent experiment , which was performed at unitarity @xcite ,",
    "this high-@xmath2 behavior is observed , with significant deviations apparently beginning between @xmath76 and @xmath18 as @xmath18 is approached from above . staying in this high-@xmath2 regime ,",
    "as we move to high polarization ( @xmath21 near 1 ) at a given @xmath64 and @xmath2 , the scattering time of species @xmath77 is roughly @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the @xmath82wave scattering cross section ( see eq .",
    "( [ general_cross_section ] ) ) evaluated at a typical value of momentum .",
    "thus , the scattering time of the down atoms @xmath83 decreases by only a factor of two due to the increase of the density @xmath11 of the up atoms that they scatter from .",
    "the up atom scattering time @xmath84 , on the other hand , increases by a factor of @xmath85 as the down atoms that they scatter from become dilute . at high polarization ,",
    "the spin current consists of the down atoms moving with respect to the up atoms at typical speed @xmath86 , so @xmath87 is not strongly polarization dependent for @xmath88 ; the experimental results @xcite are consistent with this . the heat , on the other hand , is mostly carried by the up atoms at high polarization , resulting in @xmath89 , a relation between the two diffusivities that appears to remain true at high polarization for all @xmath2 away from the superfluid phases . at @xmath66 and high",
    "@xmath2 the two diffusivities are comparable , but @xmath72 remains larger than @xmath71 because a single @xmath6-wave scattering event completely randomizes the total spin current carried by the two atoms , while the component of the heat current carried by their center of mass is preserved .",
    "thus it appears that the heat mode always diffuses faster than the spin mode .    moving towards lower @xmath2 ,",
    "let s next pause at @xmath90 , noting that here @xmath91 , and @xmath83 is the larger of @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "for the polarized gas @xmath94 .",
    "we next ( still just power - counting ) look at the polarized gas in the intermediate temperature regime @xmath27 where the majority atoms are degenerate ( @xmath95 ) , while the minority atoms are not ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "some changes from the high - t regime are : only up atoms with energy within @xmath96 of @xmath97 are involved in the scattering and all but a fraction @xmath98 of the final states of the scattering are pauli - blocked due to the degeneracy of the up atoms .",
    "this increases @xmath83 by a factor of @xmath99 , and @xmath84 by a factor of @xmath100 , compared to their values at @xmath90 .",
    "thus , @xmath83 is the larger of @xmath101 and @xmath102 . as a result ,",
    "@xmath103 is the larger of @xmath104 and @xmath105 , while @xmath72 is again larger than @xmath71 by a factor @xmath85 .",
    "this estimate of @xmath71 is consistent with a previous quantitative calculation @xcite .",
    "note that the temperature dependence of @xmath71 crosses over from a decreasing function of @xmath2 at low @xmath2 to an increasing function at high @xmath2 .",
    "the recent measurements @xcite of the spin drag in a polarized unitary gas show this crossover occurring at roughly @xmath106 . on the bec side of the feshbach resonance ,",
    "the minority atoms bind in to bosonic feshbach molecules at low enough @xmath2 .",
    "but as long as these molecules remain nondegenerate and thus not superfluid , the above estimates of the diffusivities should hold .    for @xmath25 ,",
    "the minority atoms become degenerate .",
    "this leads to superfluidity on the bec side of the feshbach resonance as well as at low polarization near unitarity .",
    "but there are regimes on the bcs side of the resonance as well as near unitarity at high polarization where the minority atoms ( near unitarity strongly `` dressed '' as polarons ) form a degenerate fermi gas . here the important change from the intermediate temperature regime at the level of `` power - counting ''",
    "is that only minority atoms with energy within @xmath96 of @xmath107 are involved in the scattering and they have momentum @xmath108 instead of a thermal momentum .",
    "this increases the diffusivities by a factor of @xmath109 , so the spin diffusivity in these degenerate fermi liquid regimes is the larger of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "we expect that @xmath72 is still greater than @xmath71 by a factor of @xmath85 but this question should be examined more carefully within fermi liquid theory .    at low temperature ,",
    "the polarized fermi liquid may become a @xmath21-wave superfluid , with pairing within one species mediated by the attraction to the other species @xcite .",
    "or it may have a fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase with cooper pairs of nonzero total momentum @xcite . in the superfluid phases",
    ", the thermal diffusivity should diverge to infinity , as heat is carried ballistically by second sound modes .",
    "the spin diffusivity presumably remains finite in the superfluid phases , although , as we discuss below , the spin seebeck effect appears to generally be divergent in a polarized superfluid .",
    "more challenging to estimate than these spin and thermal diffusivities are the effects that mix spin and heat transport , namely the spin seebeck and the spin peltier effects .",
    "here we present `` simple '' arguments for the signs of these effects in two regimes : ( 1 ) far away from unitarity for all temperature ranges , and ( 2 ) at unitarity in the classical regime .",
    "here we always consider a spin - polarized gas , since these `` magnetocaloric '' effects vanish by symmetry in the case of an unpolarized gas where the two species also have equal mass .",
    "\\(1 ) well away from unitarity ( @xmath112 ) , the scattering cross section is essentially @xmath113 and independent of momentum for all temperatures , since the interaction is weak and the atoms are not thermally excited to @xmath114 . generally , the scattering rate is proportional to the _ cross section _",
    "@xmath115 _ relative speed_. thus , in this ( low energy ) regime , the scattering rate is @xmath116 .",
    "this implies minority atoms will scatter more frequently with the majority atoms of higher energy than majority atoms of lower energy since higher - energy majority atoms have higher relative speed .",
    "consequently , the direction of the minority current is along the flow of higher - energy ( `` hot '' ) majority atoms and thus parallel to the heat current . for a uniformly spin - polarized gas with a temperature gradient , where the spin seebeck effect occurs",
    ", the primary current is the heat current transporting `` hot '' majority atoms from the hot region to the cold region and transporting `` cold '' majority atoms from the cold region to the hot region .",
    "the fact that the minority current is aligned with that of the `` hot '' majority atoms means the direction of the net spin current ( spin seebeck current ) is opposite from that of the heat current .",
    "thus , the initially cold region becomes less polarized due to minority atoms transported by the spin seebeck current .    ) atoms ( top )",
    "collide more often with minority ( @xmath41 ) atoms than do `` cold '' majority atoms ( bottom ) , giving the spin seebeck current and the heat current opposite directions .",
    "( b ) at unitarity , the scattering rate is inversely proportional to the relative speed .",
    "therefore , the direction of the spin seebeck current is reversed relative to ( a).,width=336 ]    for a polarized gas with a polarization gradient but zero temperature gradient , where the spin peltier effect occurs , the primary current is the spin current which transports minority atoms from the less - polarized region to the more - polarized region .",
    "since again these minority atoms scatter more often with `` hot '' majority atoms , the resulting heat current is towards the more - polarized region , resulting in a spin peltier ( heat ) current whose direction is opposite to the primary spin current . in summary , for a gas far from unitarity , the primary currents and the magnetocaloric currents are in opposite directions . in other words , the off - diagonal elements in eq .",
    "( [ diffusion_tp ] ) are negative while the diagonal elements are positive .",
    "\\(2 ) at high temperatures ( @xmath117 ) and near unitarity ( @xmath118 ) , the @xmath6-wave scattering cross section is @xmath119 and thus is momentum - dependent , where @xmath120 is the relative momentum .",
    "therefore , the scattering rate is roughly @xmath121 . as a result , now minority atoms scatter more often with `` cold '' majority atoms .",
    "since this is exactly the opposite from the case of far away from unitarity , the spin seebeck and spin peltier currents are reversed relative to the above discussion in ( 1 ) .",
    "therefore , at high temperature and unitarity , the primary currents and the magnetocaloric currents are in the same directions , giving @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ diffusion_tp ] ) positive sign . as we will see in the next section , the spin peltier coefficient @xmath122 in eq .",
    "( [ diffusion_tp ] ) is negative for low polarization and becomes positive for high polarization .",
    "this sign change in @xmath122 comes from the definition of currents and choice of driving forces and this will be clarified in the section vii where we discuss the kubo approach .",
    "directions of the spin seebeck effect in both limiting regimes are illustrated in figure [ illustration_seebeck ] .    at low temperatures and unitarity , it is not straightforward to apply the above argument to predict the direction of spin seebeck and/or spin peltier currents since the many body effects may significantly modify the scattering cross section @xcite , which begins to depend on the center of mass momentum as well as the relative momentum",
    ". there is , however , a different line of argument that indicates that the sign of the spin seebeck effect near unitarity remains the same as the temperature is lowered .",
    "consider low enough temperatures and polarization less than the chandrasekhar - clogston limit @xcite , in the superfluid phase @xcite .",
    "when there is a temperature gradient in the system , heat flows `` ballistically '' from the hot region to the cold region by flow of the normal fluid with respect to the superfluid ( in the usual two - fluid description of the superfluid phase ) . in the reference frame where the total particle density current vanishes ( center of mass frame ) , the superfluid flows in the opposite direction to counterbalance the mass current of the normal fluid .",
    "since the @xmath6-wave superfluid consists of equal numbers of majority and minority atoms , both the spin current and the heat current are carried only by the normal fluid . as a result ,",
    "the spin seebeck current and the heat current are in the same directions at low temperature in and , presumably , near the superfluid phase .",
    "therefore , we expect the sign of the spin seebeck effect to remain the same for all temperatures at unitarity . both the thermal conductivity and the spin seebeck coefficient will diverge at the transition to the superfluid phase .    as another approach to these questions , there is an interesting artificial interaction , namely the maxwellian interaction where the scattering cross section is proportional to @xmath123 and the boltzmann equation can be solved exactly in the high temperature limit . since the scattering rate does not depend on relative velocity ( @xmath124 constant ) ,",
    "there are no spin seebeck or spin peltier currents in this case .",
    "then , if we perturb the scattering cross section around the maxwellian case , putting in an additional relative - velocity dependence to the scattering rate `` by hand '' , we can perturbatively calculate the spin seebeck and spin peltier currents and manipulate the direction of these currents by changing the sign of the perturbation .",
    "this allows us to explicitly show how the magnetocaloric currents are generated from a relative - velocity - dependent cross section .",
    "this will be discussed in the following section in detail .",
    "in the limit of high temperature @xmath125 , the gas is effectively classical , and its dynamics obey the boltzmann equation . in the absence of external forces but with gradients in local temperature and local densities , the steady - state boltzmann equation for species",
    "@xmath77 ( @xmath40 or @xmath41 ) is the following ( @xmath79 ) : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the momentum distribution of species @xmath77 , and the velocity is @xmath128 .",
    "@xmath129 and @xmath130 are momenta after collision and satisfy the energy momentum conservation . working near equilibrium , we linearize the boltzmann equation by introducing a small deviation @xmath131 : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the equilibrium distribution . in this high temperature regime ,",
    "the equilibrium distribution is the boltzmann distribution , @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "since the most relevant length scale in the classical regime is the thermal de broglie wavelength @xmath136 , it is convenient to scale the wave vector * k * with @xmath136 ; * k * = @xmath137 .",
    "then , @xmath138 .",
    "let s impose the mechanical equilibrium condition . in this classical limit ,",
    "it is enough to use the ideal gas pressure at equilibrium ; @xmath139 . from the spatially uniform pressure condition we can relate the density gradients and the temperature gradient via @xmath140 to linear order in the gradients .",
    "this relation enables us to express the currents in terms of any two linearly - independent `` driving '' terms such as ( @xmath141 ) , ( @xmath142 ) , ( @xmath143 ) or any other convenient combinations .",
    "it is convenient to work with ( @xmath144 , @xmath145 ) in intermediate stages of the calculation and then transform it to the desired combination of driving forces using the equilibrium equation of state .",

    "@xmath147 takes @xmath148 as an argument .",
    "we follow the standard definitions of the particle and energy currents of each species @xcite , @xmath149 because of galilean invariance , we need to specify an inertial frame . except when specified otherwise , we work in the frame where the local particle current is zero : @xmath150 .",
    "the @xmath6-wave scattering cross section that captures most physics of a short - range interaction is @xmath151 where we scaled the scattering length @xmath8 with @xmath136 .",
    "an exact solution of the boltzmann equation for such a cross section is not known and thus we need to resort to approximation methods .",
    "one of the standard ways to find an approximate solution of a linearized boltzmann equation is the moment expansion method ( for example , see @xcite ) . considering all symmetries and assuming the true solution is analytic near small @xmath152 , we take the following ansatz for @xmath131 ( @xmath153 : @xmath154 we only consider the case where @xmath155 and @xmath145 are both parallel to the @xmath156 axis . we need to determine the dimensionless coefficients @xmath157 .",

    "i.e. _ an approximate momentum distribution from which we can calculate all currents of interest . here",
    "we present results of two limiting cases , far away from unitarity ( @xmath162 ) and at unitarity ( @xmath163 ) , which allow an analytic solution ( of this approximation ) without special functions .",
    "these correspond to the two limits @xmath164 and @xmath165 , respectively . for a general scattering length @xmath8 , it is still possible to find a closed form expression in terms of exponential integrals and incomplete gamma functions whose arguments depend on @xmath166 .",
    "obtaining @xmath167 from a straightforward calculation in the @xmath161 frame , we can express the heat current and spin current in terms of @xmath155 and @xmath145 .",

    "first observe that the solution of eq .",
    "( [ constraint ] ) is trivial ; @xmath332 .",
    "then , we use the following ansatz @xcite : @xmath333 @xmath334 are dimensionless numbers that may only depend on @xmath285 . substituting the above into original linear equations ,",
    "we obtain the same linearly independent equations in terms of @xmath334 .",
    "therefore , once we determine them , we have the approximate solution of the boltzmann equation .",
    "following the same procedure when we obtained @xmath70 and @xmath273 , we can show that @xmath335 where @xmath274 is the first term in the peltier coefficient .",
    "once we scale the scattering length with @xmath136 , the polarization and temperature dependence of @xmath71 and @xmath274 at an arbitrary @xmath173 remains the same as for @xmath175 .",
    "this proves that the scaling structure of the transport coefficients remains the same to all orders of approximation .",
    "here we present derivations of signatures of the spin seebeck effect in detail .",
    "first , apply a long wavelength temperature modulation to the system .",
    "the mechanical equilibrium condition implies that a temperature modulation is equivalent to a total density modulation .",
    "initially the gas is uniformly polarized so that the density of each spin component is @xmath336 where @xmath337 is the maximum value of total density deviation from the average density . in order to calculate the change of densities of each species , which is directly measurable in experiment and contains the signature of the spin seebeck effect , we need the space - time dependence of the density of each species",
    ". we will use the diffusion matrix and the continuity equation to derive the space - time dependence of densities .",
    "since the continuity equation for the particle number density is @xmath338 , it is practical to write diffusion equation in the format of eq .",
    "( [ diffusion ] ) . with this initial condition , a nonuniform particle current flows , but in this classical limit",
    ", there is no net energy current .",
    "thus we work in the reference frame where the local energy current vanishes ( @xmath339 ) .",
    "thanks to galilean invariance , this choice of a reference frame does not affect the physics .    following a similar procedure as described in the main text , but in this zero energy current frame , we can determine all coefficients @xmath167 ( @xmath340 ) and express the particle current of each species in terms of @xmath155 and @xmath145 .",
    "then , we can write currents in the diffusion matrix format as in eq .",
    "( [ diffusion ] ) :    near unitarity , @xmath341 far from unitarity , @xmath342 these matrix equations contain two eigenmodes , one is the thermal mode with eigenvalue @xmath343 ( @xmath344 and @xmath345 are in the same directions ) and the other is the spin mode with eigenvalue @xmath346 ( @xmath344 and @xmath345 are in opposite directions ) . as expected , @xmath347 for all polarizations in both of these limits . applying continuity equations to the above diffusion matrix equations while keeping all differential operators linear ( we restrict ourselves in a linear response theory ) , we obtain two - component diffusion equations : @xmath348 therefore , we can immediately write the time evolution of each species in terms of the eigenmodes as @xmath349    ( @xmath350 , 1 ) and ( @xmath224 , 1 ) are the eigenvectors of the spin mode and the thermal mode , respectively .",
    "@xmath350 is negative while @xmath224 is positive . @xmath351 and @xmath352 are determined by the initial condition , @xmath353 it is straightforward to derive @xmath350 , @xmath224 , @xmath351 , @xmath352 , @xmath346 and @xmath51 .",
    "for example , @xmath354 explicit expressions for @xmath350 , @xmath224 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are fairly lengthy so they are omitted here .",
    "the spin seebeck effect is most apparent when observing the densities at the edges of the system ( @xmath355 or @xmath356 ) so we choose to focus on the cold edge , @xmath357 .",
    "the uniform pressure condition implies that both majority and minority densities are initially higher than average at the cold side .",
    "thus , initially @xmath358 .",
    "even though the initial condition can be chosen to be the same for both unitarity and far away from unitarity , the time evolution of density of each species is qualitatively different for these two limiting cases .",
    "as argued in the main text , the minority density deviation has an extremum before it relaxes to zero at unitarity whereas the majority density deviation has an extremum far away from unitarity .",
    "therefore , a change in the sign of a certain species is a unique signature of the spin seebeck effect .",
    "we can express the magnitude of the spin seebeck signal in dimensionless form by @xmath359 .",
    "this quantity is plotted in figures [ deviation_unitarity ] and [ deviation_away ] . at time @xmath231",
    "( @xmath230 near unitarity and @xmath229 away from unitarity ) , the density of the species @xmath77 reaches an extremum .",
    "it is easy to derive formal expressions of @xmath231 and a dimensionless measure , @xmath360 .",
    "near unitarity , @xmath361\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\beta \\exp\\left[-\\frac{{\\frak d}_t}{{\\frak d}_t - { \\frak d}_s}\\ln\\left|\\frac{{\\frak d}_t\\beta}{{\\frak d}_s\\alpha}\\right|\\right ] ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] away from unitarity , @xmath362 \\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac{\\beta\\zeta}{\\alpha\\gamma + \\beta\\zeta } \\exp\\left[-\\frac{{\\frak d}_t}{{\\frak d}_t - { \\frak d}_s}\\ln\\left|\\frac{{\\frak d}_t\\beta\\zeta}{{\\frak d}_s\\alpha\\gamma}\\right|\\right]~.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath360 is plotted in figure [ delta_n_ext ] .",
    "as expected , the unitarity limit shows a stronger signal of the spin seebeck effect than far away from unitarity .",
    "another consequence of the spin seebeck effect is the change of polarization . from eqs .",
    "( [ species_density_deviation ] ) and ( [ time_evolution ] ) , we can express the polarization as a function of time . keeping only linear term of @xmath337",

    "figure [ polarization ] is the plot of @xmath365 normalized by @xmath366 .",
    "for completeness , we present diffusion matrices of approximate solutions and the solution of the first order perturbation of the maxwellian model in the form of eq . ( [ diffusion_tmu ] ) where the onsager relation should be explicit .",
    "we simply transform the set of driving forces @xmath367 to another set of driving forces @xmath368 associated with the entropy production .",
    "the above matrices clearly exhibit the onsager relation .",
    "also each off - diagonal element carries a term proportional to @xmath379 as mentioned in eq .",
    "( [ seebeck_kubo_log ] ) in section vi .",
    "lastly , the structure of thermal conductivity ( eq . ( [ kappa_rephrase ] ) ) is evident .",
    "motivation of this choice came from the observation that the right hand side of the linear equation does not depend on densities .",
    "therefore , a quantity in the big parenthesis in the left hand side must be proportional to @xmath384 ."
