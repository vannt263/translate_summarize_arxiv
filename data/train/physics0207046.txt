    "recently , the nonlinear propagation of electromagnetic waves in electron - positron plasma has attracted the interest of researchers@xcite @xcite and@xcite . due to the fact that the electron - positron plasma are found in van allen belts , near polar cap of pulsar , in the active galactic nuclei , as well as in the early universe .    when plasma becomes so hot that it becomes relativistic the temperature @xmath0 of the plasma exceeds the rest mass energy of electrons @xmath1 mev .",
    "in this relativistic regime the processes of electron - positron pair creation and annihilation become important ; @xmath2 .",
    "in relativistic temperature the electrons ( and positrons ) energy @xmath3 far exceeds the rest mass energy so that electrons and positrons behave kinematically similar to photons and come into equilibrium with nearly equal population .    in 1990",
    "t. tajima and t. taniuti @xcite are interested in the process of electron - positron plasma creation and annihilation occurs in relativistic ; unmagnetized plasma at high temperature of the plasma exceeds the rest mass energy of the electrons .",
    "they are emphasize the dominant population of electrons and positrons and neglect ions effect .    in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that , the positrons can be used to probe the particle transport in tokamak plasma .",
    "this new diagnostic technique could also be useful in studying transport in other magnetic confinement devices such as reversed - field pinches and magnetic mirrors .",
    "electron - positron pair production can also be possible during intense short laser pulse propagation in plasma . when picosecond electromagnetic pulse having intensity beyond @xmath4 w/@xmath5 interact with plasma , the plasma electrons can acquire oscillatory velocity ( @xmath6 ) higher than the speed of light @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the amplitude ( frequency ) of the @xmath9 radiation , @xmath7 & @xmath10 are respectively the magnitude of the electron charge and the rest mass of the electron .",
    "several authors have suggested that when the oscillatory electron energy @xmath11 exceeds @xmath12 then these electrons can create an electron- positron pairs in the presence of background positive ions . and also it has been shown that powerful short laser pulsar can generate a large amplitude electrostatic wave ( wakefield ) in a plasma in which the electron plasma frequency @xmath13 is much smaller than @xmath14 . since the amplitude of the excited wakefield can be very high ( @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the electrostatic potential )",
    ", the plasma electrons also acquire the longitudinal energy @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the relativistic momentum in the wakefield .",
    "thus , there is the possibility of creating electron - positron pairs in those regions in which wakefields and short @xmath19 pulses are localized . since the lifetime @xmath20 of the positron in such",
    "a plasma is sufficiently long .",
    "we shall have a plasma that is an admixture of electrons , positrons and positive ions .",
    "a three - component electrons - positron - ion plasma can indeed be created in laboratory plasma .",
    "v. i. berezhiani , and et .",
    "@xcite have investigated the influence of electron - positron pairs on the electrostatic wakefield that are driven by intense , short @xmath9 wave packets in a three component unmagnetized plasma .",
    "they found that in contrast to pure electron - ion plasma , the presence of positrons significantly reduce both the amplitude and the wavelength of wakefields . in view of their investigation",
    ", it is suggestive that the production of electron - positron pairs by wakefields in laboratory and cosmic plasma ought to be reconsidered because the presence of pairs may affect the wakefield that is responsible for accelerating electrons to very high energy .",
    "the important of three component admixture plasma had led to much related theoretical investigations . of these , rizzato @xcite ,",
    "investigated the possibility of high - frequency @xmath9 localization in cold unmagnetized plasmas made up of electrons , positrons and ions .",
    "it was shown that such a possibility depends on the concentration of particles , on the velocity of the solitons and on the angle between the direction of modulation and the direction of the fast spatial dependence .",
    "in particular in the case of pure electron - positron plasmas rizzato was shown that no localized solution is possible which is in contrast with results derived by mofiz et .",
    "al . ( 1985 ) from a similar model .",
    "also it was shown that low frequency magnetic fields may appear in the case of oblique modulation and that both the amplitude of the magnetic field and the amplitude of the solitary wave are very sensitive functions of the angle between the direction of modulation and fast spatial dependence .",
    "berezhiani , et .",
    "@xcite analyzed the nonlinear interaction of an arbitrarily large amplitude circularly polarized @xmath9 wave with an unmagnetized electron - positron plasma .",
    "taking into account relativistic particle - mass variation as well as large - scale density perturbation created by radiation pressure .",
    "it was found that the interaction is governed by an equation for the electromagnetic wave envelope , which is coupled with a pairs of equations describing fully nonlinear longitudinal plasma motion .",
    "this results should be useful for the understanding of nonlinear photon motion in cosmic plasmas , such as those found in the early universe and active galactic nuclei .",
    "mofiz @xcite studied the nonlinear propagation of langmiur wave in a hot ultrarelativistic electron - positron plasma .",
    "it was shown that , in a dense ultrarelativistic electron - positron plasma electrostatic modes with wavelength greater than the plasma debye length produce langmiur solitons that are spiky in nature .",
    "one essential feature of these solitons is that they can not form an energy flow toward smaller size , since they can not merge with each other . to merge ,",
    "the soliton would have to give energy to sound waves , which do not exist in electron - positron plasma .",
    "in the one dimensional case the only process accruing in a soliton gas is nonlinear interaction with electron and positron , i. e. nonlinear landau damping , which stops the solitons without changing its amplitude .",
    "the stopping length is of order of the soliton width , which is very small for a dense plasma .",
    "thus the soliton will be stopped in a short time , of the order of their creation .",
    "these spiky short duration langmiur solitons might berelated to the pulsar radiation and with its microstructures .    in @xcite , v.i.berezhiani , m.y .",
    "el - ashry and u.a .",
    "mofiz are investigated the propagation of intense electromagnetic radiation in an admixture of unmagnetized electron - positron - ion plasma analytically .",
    "it was shown that electromagnetic radiation of arbitrary amplitude in presence of heavy ions , in contrast to the case of pure electron - positron plasma , may be localized with the generation of humped ambipolar potential in the plasma , i.e. the driving field intensity creates intense soliton in the plasma with the generation of double hump ambipolar potentials . with the increase of the value of @xmath21 ( = @xmath22 )",
    ", they found that the tendency of converging a single hump soliton to a double hump one . in their investigation",
    "they neglected the ion dynamics .",
    "consideration of ion dynamics , of course , may effect the localization phenomenon .",
    "this effect will be studied here .      to describe the admixture of plasma made up of electrons , positrons and ions , we use maxwell equations , in which the fields are expressed in terms of the potentials , as described above .",
    "accordingly , using poissons equation , we may obtain the following equations for the potentials : @xmath28 and : @xmath29 here , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the charge and current densities , and given by : @xmath32 where @xmath33 indicates the particle species @xmath33 ( = e , p , i for electrons , positrons , and ions , respectively ) , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the charge and density of the corresponding particle @xmath33 .",
    "we shall consider the case in which the admixture equilibrium state is characterized by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , is the equilibrium density of the particle @xmath33 .",
    "the relativistic equations of motion of different particles of unmagnetized plasma admixture is written as : @xmath38\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 where , @xmath41 is the rest mass of the particle @xmath42 .        analyzing the equation of motion and the wave equations into longitudinal ( parallel to the direction of the wave propagation ) and a transverse ( perpendicular plan ) parts , then the transverse part of the equation of motion is immediately integrated to give : @xmath46 where the constant of integration is set equal to zero , since the particles were assumed to be immobile at infinity where the field is zero .            now",
    ", we can integrate both sides with respect to @xmath55 , yield : @xmath56 where , @xmath57 is the constant of integration , which could be determine from the boundary conditions . here , @xmath58 when @xmath59 , we get ; @xmath60 , and accordingly : @xmath61 @xmath62                            equation (  [ phi ] ) and equation (  [ psi ] ) are coupled together and forming a system of nonlinear second order deferential equations .",
    "it is rather difficult to obtain an analytical solution of them .",
    "however , in the following , we present numerical solutions of equation (  [ phi ] ) and equation (  [ psi ] ) .",
    "taking some typical parameters : @xmath95 and by using taylor method , we have obtained the wakefield profiles at different values of @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
