    "metal - semiconductor heterojunctions have received much attention in the context of magnetoelectronics or spintronics because they could open up the possibility to inject a spin - polarized current from a ferromagnetic ( fm ) metal into a semiconductor .",
    "this is a pre - requisite for anticipated future electronic devices making use of spin - polarized carriers.@xcite in this paper , we present theoretical investigations of thin films for two materials classes relevant in this context , namely transition metal ( tm ) mono - silicides , @xmath0si ( @xmath0= mn , fe , co , ni ) , in the cscl crystal structure , and heusler alloys @xmath1mnsi ( @xmath0= fe , co , ni ) .",
    "the two materials classes are closely related in their crystal structure .",
    "pictorially , one can think of @xmath1mnsi films as being formed by the substitution of mn for half of the si atoms in each si layer of the cscl - like @xmath0si ( @xmath0=fe , co , ni ) films .",
    "both materials classes are of potential interest for spintronics applications . some heusler alloys , like co@xmath3mn@xmath4 ( @xmath4=si , ge , sn ) are ferromagnets even well above room temperature , and",
    "are predicted by band theory to be magnetic half - metals , i.e. , the fermi energy lies in a region of partially occupied bands for one spin channel , while lying in a gap of the density of states in the other.@xcite therefore half - metallic heusler alloys can in principle provide 100% spin - polarized carriers , and could thus serve as spin - filters in future spintronics devices .",
    "however , also the structurally simpler mono - silicides have a potential to be applied in spintronics devices : recently , we have shown that thin mnsi films on si(001 ) possess sizable magnetic moments at the mn atoms,@xcite despite the fact that bulk mnsi ( in the corresponding hypothetical cscl crystal structure ) is non - magnetic .",
    "moreover , calculations of cosi in cscl crystal structure find this ( metastable ) compound to be ferromagnetic .",
    "this motivated us to study systematically both the structural and magnetic properties of late tm mono - silicides films .",
    "in addition , mixed tm silicides have also attracted interest , since evidence has been given that fesi could be made ferromagnetic by doping with co. @xcite    from the viewpoint of applications , it is highly desirable to grow well - defined fm metallic films on the most common semiconductor , silicon , in particular on the technologically relevant si(001 ) surface .",
    "for this reason , we concentrate in the present paper on pseudomorphic thin films of mono - silicides and heusler alloys on si(001 ) . for epitaxial growth ,",
    "the mono - silicides in cscl - like crystal structure are particularly attractive : we find that the cscl structure is a metastable phase of the mono - silicides , only moderately higher in energy than the ground state crystal structure , and it is closely lattice - matched with si(001 ) .",
    "moreover , such cosi and nisi crystals have been found to be ` supersoft ' materials,@xcite i.e. , there is a range of elastic deformations with very little energetic cost .",
    "the heusler alloys show a somewhat larger lattice - mismatch with si(001 ) of about 4% . apart from good lattice - match , flat and atomically sharp interfaces are of crucial importance for efficient spin injection . in this context",
    ", it is noteworthy that di - silicide films have been grown with atomically sharp interfaces to si(111 ) and si(100 ) .",
    "the caf@xmath3 crystal structure of di - silicides is similar to the cscl crystal structure of mono - silicides ( it results if each second metal site in the cscl structure is left vacant ) .",
    "this suggests that film growth with atomically sharp interface should also be possible for the mono - silicides films . in practice ,",
    "first a buffer layer of the di - silicide is grown , followed by growth of the mono - silicide film . with this strategy",
    ", cscl - like fesi and cosi films have already been grown on si(111 ) by von knel et al.@xcite    while theoretical investigations of cscl - like @xmath0si thin films on si(001 ) are scarce,@xcite a group of studies addressing the initial reaction processes of tm adatoms with the si substrate report that mn , co and ni adatoms prefer subsurface sites.@xcite heusler alloy films have been studied experimentally mostly in view of their application in tunnelling magneto - resistance devices.@xcite concerning epitaxial growth on semiconductor substrates , results for thin co@xmath3mnge @xcite and co@xmath3mnsi @xcite films on gaas(001 ) have been reported . from the theoretical side , calculations of the co@xmath3mnsi(001 )",
    "surface,@xcite as well as of the interface between co@xmath3mnge and gaas(001)@xcite have been performed .    in the present paper , we identify the trends in chemical bonding , thermodynamic stability , and magnetism of the @xmath0si and @xmath1mnsi thin films .",
    "most importantly , our calculations predict that , in addition to ultrathin fm mnsi / si(001 ) films,@xcite the cosi / si(001 ) thin films are also fm ; and that co@xmath3mnsi / si(001 ) films have a robust fm ground state .",
    "the present dft calculations were performed using the all - electron full - potential augmented plane - wave plus local - orbital method.@xcite the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite was adopted for the exchange - correlation potential , since it has been shown  @xcite that gga gives a better description for both transition metals and their silicides than the local - spin - density approximation .",
    "the @xmath0si or @xmath1mnsi thin films on si(001 ) were modelled by a slab consisting of eight successive si(001 ) layers and the @xmath0si ( see fig .",
    "1 ) or @xmath1mnsi layers ( see section [ heusler ] ) on both sides , in order to retain the inversion symmetry .",
    "the gga calculated equilibrium lattice constant ( 5.48   ) of bulk si is used for the si(001 ) substrate . a supercell with about 10 - 11   vacuum between the    = mn , fe , co , or ni films on si(001 ) ( half of the slab ) , with 0.5 ml @xmath0 in ( a ) the first- or ( b ) second - layer interstitial sites , 1 ml @xmath0 ( c ) in a mixed layer or ( d ) in a si-@xmath0 sandwich , or ( e ) 2 ml or ( f ) 3 ml @xmath0 cscl - like sandwich structures .",
    "black balls represent @xmath0 and gray balls si atoms .",
    "the bonds shorter than 2.65   are shown.,width=302 ]    slabs , and with a lateral @xmath5 periodicity  @xcite ( lattice constant of 3.87   ) was used .",
    "note that @xmath6=1 ml ( monolayer ) coverage of @xmath0 refers to two @xmath0 adatoms per @xmath5 cell on either side of the slab .",
    "the muffin - tin radii are chosen to be 1.11   for mn , as used in our previous calculations,@xcite and 1.06   for fe , co , ni , and si , in order to avoid overlap of the muffin - tin spheres ( due to covalent bond - shortening within the tm silicide series , as we report below ) during structure relaxations .",
    "this choice is reasonable in view of their respective atomic sizes .",
    "the cut - off energy for the interstitial plane - wave expansion is chosen to be 15.2 ryd.@xcite a set of 10@xmath710@xmath71 special @xmath8 points is used for integrations over the brillouin zone of the @xmath5 surface cell . except for the two central si layers in the slab ,",
    "all the @xmath0 and other si atoms are relaxed until the calculated atomic force for each of them is smaller than 0.05 ev /  . throughout this paper , formation energies",
    "are given per @xmath5 cell , defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 refer to the total energy per @xmath5 unit cell with surface area @xmath13 , the number of atoms of each chemical type in the cell , and their chemical potentials as calculated from the corresponding bulk materials .",
    "the factor 2 in the denominator is because the slab contains two equivalent surfaces due to the inversion symmetry .",
    "@xmath14=84 mev / @xmath15 is the surface energy of the clean , @xmath16-reconstructed si(001 ) surface .",
    "we note that @xmath17 defined in this way contains the bulk heat of formation , as well as surface and interface contributions .",
    "the interface energy alone , which could serve as an indicator for adhesion of the films to the substrate , is not considered .",
    "the numerical accuracy of the present calculations is carefully checked by using higher cut - off energy and more @xmath8 points . with these settings , the absolute values of @xmath17",
    "are converged with respect to cut - off energy and * k*-point sampling to better than 0.1 ev . however , for the _ relative _ stability of structures with the same composition but different geometries and/or magnetic structures , we can give a much stricter error estimate , only several mev , due to error cancellation since all numbers entering the energy difference are calculated with the same technical settings .",
    "the degree of spin polarization at the fermi level is quantified from the spin - resolved density of states ( dos ) , which is calculated using a finer * k*-point mesh of @xmath18 in conjunction with the tetrahedron method for brillouin integration .",
    "we note that a more realistic assessment of spin injection at the interface would have to consider the match in fermi velocities in the film and the substrate . for bulk magnets ,",
    "a spin polarization including a suitable weighting with the fermi velocity can be defined@xcite .",
    "however , in this work we retain the more wide - spread definition of the dos .",
    "before studying the @xmath0si thin films on si(001 ) , we briefly discuss the bulk phases of the tm mono - silicides @xmath0si ( @xmath0=mn , fe , co , ni ) . for all metal atoms discussed here ,",
    "the mono - silicides have the same bulk crystal structure , the b20 structure , whose symmetry is characterized by the @xmath192@xmath203 space group.@xcite since the lattice constant of the cubic unit cell is around 4.5   for all these compounds , they can not be lattice - matched with si(001 ) .",
    "however , the metastable cscl phase calculated within dft - gga lies only slightly above the ground - state @xmath192@xmath203 structure in total energy , for @xmath0=mn , fe , co , and ni by 0.25 , 0.04 , 0.42 , and 0.24 ev per formula unit , respectively .",
    "moreover , it follows from our gga calculations that the equilibrium lattice constants for the metastable cscl phases are 2.79 , 2.77 , 2.78 , and 2.85   , respectively .",
    "they are almost half the calculated lattice constant of si ( 5.48   ) , and thus the lattice mismatch with si(001 ) is less than 2% for the cscl - like mnsi , fesi , and cosi , and 4% for nisi .",
    "these results for @xmath0si ( @xmath0=fe , co ) agree well with the previous calculations by moroni , podloucky , and hafner.@xcite    we show in fig .",
    "2 the density of states of the cscl - like @xmath0si calculated within gga in the nonmagnetic ( nm ) state . the cscl - like fesi and nisi have a low dos at the fermi level , which explains , within the framework of the stoner model of magnetism , why we find them to be non - magnetic .",
    "in contrast , the fermi level of the cscl - like mnsi lies at a falling shoulder of the @xmath21 dos .",
    "in particular , the fermi level of the cscl - like cosi lies at a steep slope of the @xmath22 dos , which gives rise to stoner fm instability .",
    "this has also been discussed by profeta @xmath23 @xmath24.@xcite our calculations show that the fm ground state of cosi has a spin moment of 0.63 @xmath25/co and a lower total energy than the nm state by 16 mev per formula unit .    since epitaxial growth of the cscl - like fesi and cosi films on si(111 ) has already been achieved by von knel _",
    "et al._,@xcite and given that cosi has the highest energy difference for the metastable phase among the cscl - like @xmath0si ( @xmath0=mn , fe , co , ni ) , we consider it likely that growth of the cscl - like @xmath0si films on si(001 ) , and of the cscl - like mnsi and nisi films on si(111 ) , can be achieved as well .",
    "si ( @xmath0=mn , fe , co , ni ) in the non - magnetic state .",
    "the solid lines refer to the @xmath0 @xmath2 bands , which split into the lower - lying @xmath21 and the higher - lying @xmath22 bands .",
    "the dashed lines refer to the si @xmath26 states ( magnified four times for clarity ) . the fermi level of mnsi ( calculated to be 11.76 ev ) is used as energy zero for _ all _ plots .",
    "the fermi levels ( vertical dotted lines ) of fesi , cosi , and nisi differ from that of mnsi by 0.81 , 0.23 , and @xmath27 ev , respectively .",
    "obviously , the shapes of those dos are similar , and the fermi level shifts towards and strides over the @xmath22 states to accommodate more and more @xmath28-electrons as @xmath0 varies from mn through fe and co to ni .",
    "note that , as @xmath0 varies from mn to ni , the @xmath0 @xmath2 bands monotonously shift down toward the si @xmath26 valence bands.,width=321 ]      for various amounts of tm atoms deposited on si(001 ) , we perform calculations to investigate the stable binding sites or the ( meta-)stable atomic structure of films . as seen below , the preceding calculations for @xmath6=0.5 ml and 1 ml are helpful to understand why the @xmath0 atoms prefer subsurface sites and the si atoms sit in the topmost layer .",
    "we start our calculations by considering a coverage of @xmath290.5 ml of metal atoms @xmath0 , occupying either atomic sites _ on the surface _ [ cf .",
    "1(a ) ] or _ subsurface _ sites [ cf .",
    "1(b ) ] of si(001 ) .",
    "the results show that all metal adsorbates , @xmath0=mn , fe , co , and ni , are generally more stable at si(001 ) subsurface than at surface sites , by about 0.1 ev per ( 1@xmath71 ) cell for @xmath0=mn , and more than 0.4 ev for @xmath0=fe , co , or ni , as seen in table  [ tablei ] .",
    "the surface adatoms @xmath0=mn , fe , and co have a sizable spin moment , and in table  [ tableii ] , the values within the atomic muffin - tin spheres are reported .",
    "the reduction of the spin magnetic moment of @xmath0 atoms on subsurface sites is due to the increased number of @xmath0-si bonds . in particular , the magnetic moment of the subsurface co atom",
    "is almost completely quenched .",
    "moreover , we find ni atoms to have vanishing magnetic moments both on the surface and at subsurface sites .",
    "note that in these @xmath0-si ( @xmath0=mn , fe , co ) systems , spin    lcccccc + & a&b&c&d&e&f + mn&0.76&0.67&0.89&0.61&0.43&1.55 + & ( 0.77)&(0.68)&(0.90)&(0.62)&(0.40)&(1.53 ) + fe&1.11&0.67&0.93&0.01&1.71&3.78 + co&0.99&0.47&0.89&0.44&2.38&4.15 + ni&0.59&0.18&0.22&0.64&2.37&3.46 +    lcccccc + @xmath30&a&b&c&d & & + mn&3.68&3.08&3.26 , 2.25&2.16 , 1.65 & & + fe&2.35&2.09&2.45 , 1.94&0.11 , 0.05 & & + co&0.95&0.03&0.45 , 0.07&0.41 , 0.35 & & +    moments are also induced on the si atoms adjacent to @xmath0 , albeit smaller than 0.1 @xmath25 .",
    "secondly , we compare two possible atomic structures for 1  ml coverage , the 1ml-@xmath0 surface mixed layer [ cf .",
    "1(c ) ] and the layered si-@xmath0 film [ cf .",
    "our results show that the latter is energetically more favorable than the former , by about 0.3 ev per ( 1@xmath71 ) cell for @xmath0=mn and around 1.0 ev for @xmath0=fe , co , or ni .",
    "next , we analyse the chemical bonding in these systems .",
    "we start by noting that @xmath0 ( = mn , fe , co , or ni ) and si have almost identical electronegativity of 1.6 or 1.7 , and hence form strong covalent bonds . from fig .",
    "3 , we see that the @xmath0-si bonds have similar covalent charge density as the si - si bonds .",
    "moreover , for all relaxed structures of the si-@xmath0/si(001 ) ( @xmath0=mn , fe , co ) films , we find that both the substitutional @xmath0 ( named @xmath01 ) and the interstitial @xmath0 ( named @xmath02 ) each have four @xmath0-si bonds which are shorter , by 0.13   at least , than the sum of the @xmath0 and si atomic radii , due to covalent bond contraction .",
    "nisi is an exception to this general trend ; in si - ni / si(001 ) the substitutional ni1 has four shrunk ni - si bonds which are contracted by 0.08   , and the interstitial ni2 has only two short ni - si bonds , contracted by 0.18   .",
    "this exceptional behavior , both the smaller ni1-si bond - shortening and    0 ) plane for 1  ml si - capped silicide films , si-@xmath0/si(001 ) [ @xmath0=mn ( left panels ) or ni ( right panels ) , cf .",
    "the cuts are chosen to contain the substitutional-@xmath01 and si ( upper row ) , or the interstitial-@xmath02 and si atoms ( lower row ) .",
    "contour lines from 0.1 to 0.6 e /   @xmath31 in steps of 0.1 e /   @xmath31 are shown .",
    "the mn - si and ni - si bonds have a covalent charge density as high as 0.4 e /   @xmath31 , similar to the si - si bonds with 0.5 e /   @xmath31.,width=321 ]    the reduced number of short ni2-si bonds , can be understood by considering that the number of empty @xmath2 orbitals available for bonding with si decreases in the tm series from mn to ni .",
    "note that the transition metal atoms are seven - fold coordinated to si in the natural bulk silicides @xmath0si , and eight - fold coordinated in @xmath0si@xmath3 .",
    "thus , the subsurface tm layer capped by a si layer in the si-@xmath0/si(001 ) films optimizes the surface covalent bonding structure , since it allows for the optimum fourfold coordination of the capping si atoms , while simultaneously increasing the coordination of the @xmath0 atoms ( compared to _ on surface _",
    "adsorption ) .",
    "the si - termination of the cscl - like fesi / si(111 ) film surface has been previously verified both experimentally and theoretically.@xcite moreover , the si capping layer , due to the doubled atomic density as compared with the si(001 ) substrate , displays strong buckling , 0.43 , 0.57 , 0.47 , and 0.21   in the si-@xmath0/si(001 ) film with @xmath0=mn , fe , co , or ni , respectively .    since the layered si-@xmath0 film has turned out to energetically most favorable from the above calculations , we employ the same atomic structure to multilayered si-@xmath0 [ @xmath32(si - mn ) ] films , i.e. , to the cscl - like @xmath0si films with si termination , as depicted in figs .",
    "1(e ) and 1(f ) .",
    "as seen in columns ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) of table  [ tablei ] , the formation energy @xmath33 , definded according to eq . ( 1 ) , decreases monotonously with increasing film thickness for all cscl - like @xmath0si films .",
    "this decrease is a consequence of the heat of formation released for each formula unit of @xmath0si formed from the elements .",
    "the onset of negative @xmath33 at @xmath34  ml mn or 1 ml @xmath0 ( @xmath0=fe , co , ni ) indicates that the films are stable against decomposition into the clean si(001 ) surface and elemental bulk @xmath0",
    ".    moreover , the thermodynamic stability of the @xmath0si films increases as @xmath0 varies from mn through fe , co to ni at @xmath352 ml .",
    "we attribute this finding to the increasing @xmath0si bond strength : note that @xmath33 is calculated with reference to the clean si(001 ) surface and elemental tm bulk ( see eq .",
    "1 ) . both gga calculations and experimental measurements agree that the cohesive energies of fe , co , and ni are very similar , and higher than that of mn by about 1  ev.@xcite therefore the decreasing @xmath33 of the @xmath0si films at @xmath36  ml as @xmath0 varies from mn to the later tms indicates that the binding energy of the @xmath0 atoms on si(001 ) increases more strongly so as to overcompensate the rise in the removal energy of an @xmath0 atom from its bulk reservoir upon variation of @xmath0 from mn to the later tms .",
    "hence , the strength of the @xmath0si bonds must increase accordingly .",
    "this trend can be understood by observing that the @xmath0 @xmath2 bands increasingly come into resonance with the si @xmath26 valence bands due to decreasing energy separation between them ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , because the @xmath0 @xmath2 level shifts down towards the si @xmath26 level as the atomic number of the transition metal increases .",
    "however , the trend is reversed for the nisi film at @xmath37  ml [ see column ( e ) in table  [ tablei ] ] . for thicker @xmath0si films ,",
    "the order of thermodynamic stability , quoted from low to high , changes to @xmath0=mn , ni , fe , co at @xmath38  ml [ see column ( f ) in table  [ tablei ] ] . the anomaly in the nisi case",
    "can be explained in terms of @xmath0 @xmath2 orbital occupation .",
    "since ni has the fewest empty @xmath2 orbitals available for bonding with si , the ni atoms in the nisi film ( except for the interfacial ni ) being eightfold coordinated to si become oversaturated .",
    "the oversaturation for eightfold si coordination of ni is also reflected by the increased lattice constant of the cscl - like nisi [ compared with @xmath0si ( @xmath0=mn , fe , co ) as seen in sec .",
    "this interpretation is corroborated by the experimental observation that the lattice constant of the eightfold coordinated nisi@xmath3 is larger than that of cosi@xmath3 .",
    "the above results are helpful to understand three experimental observations .",
    "firstly , pre - adsorbed co has been found to improve the quality of fe films grown on si(001).@xcite our calculations show that co ",
    "si bonds are stronger than fe ",
    "si bonds ; hence the improved film quality can be explained by a cosi layer forming at the interface which prevents interdiffusion between the fe overlayer and the si substrate .",
    "moreover , we can predict that ni can not be used for this purpose , because the highly si - coordinated ni - silicide is thermodynamically less stable than fe - silicide , as we reported above .",
    "hence , we conclude from our calculations that ni is unsuitable for a barrier layer to suppress the intermixing between fe and si .",
    "secondly , the trends in bond strength revealed by our calculations help to explain the structure of heusler alloys with the chemical composition @xmath1mnsi ( @xmath0=fe , co , ni ) , or more generally @xmath39,@xcite in which @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath4 have a similar electronegativity and @xmath41 possesses a robust magnetic moment . in these materials , so - called full heusler alloys , which can be considered as a ( 111 ) stacking of layers with the sequence @xmath42 , it is always the element @xmath40 capable of making stronger bonds to @xmath4 which occurs in the layers adjacent to @xmath4 , while the more weakly bonding element @xmath41 has @xmath4 only as its second neighbors . together with knowledge of the energetic positions of the atomic levels of the @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath4 atoms , and",
    "thus of their relative bond strengths , this rule can be used as heuristics in the search for new heusler alloys ( some of which may be half - metallic fms ) , somewhat similar in spirit to the ` band gap engineering ' done in semiconductor physics .",
    "thirdly , on the basis of our results , we can explain the observed site selectivity@xcite for substitution of other tms in the heusler alloy fe@xmath43fe@xmath44si : the tms to the right of fe in the periodic table , co and ni , making stronger bonds to si than fe itself , substitute for fe@xmath45 to form new stronger bonds with four si neighbors .",
    "the earlier tms ti , v , cr , mn , however , substitute for fe@xmath44 , thus preserving the stronger fe@xmath45-si bonds .",
    "next we turn to the magnetism of the @xmath0si thin films on si(001 ) [ @xmath32(si-@xmath0)/si(001 ) ] . as a general trend in the pseudomorphic ( si-@xmath0)/si(001 ) films [ cf .",
    "1(d ) ] , we find that the substitutional @xmath01 ( cf .",
    "3 ) has a little larger spin moment ( e.g. , 2.16 @xmath25/mn1 ) than the interstitial @xmath02 ( e.g. , 1.65 @xmath25/mn2 ) , as seen in table  [ tableii ] .",
    "this can be partly ascribed to the number of @xmath0-si bond being fewer by one for @xmath01 ( six - fold coordination ) than @xmath02 ( seven - fold coordination ) .",
    "first , we describe in more detail the results for mnsi films .",
    "the ( si - mn)/si(001 ) film is found from our calculations to be a ferromagnetic metal with a sizable spin moment , in which the si atoms mediate the fm mn - mn coupling via hybridization between the si @xmath26 and mn @xmath2 itinerant electrons .",
    "a vital role is played by the capping si atoms ; in their absence the bare mn film on si(001 ) is found to be antiferromagnetic ( afm).@xcite for the 2(si - mn)/si(001 ) film , our calculations also predict a fm metallic ground state .",
    "the 3(si - mn)/si(001 ) film is found to be ferrimagnetic with fm ( ferrimagnetic ) intra ( inter)-layer coupling , as seen in tables  [ tableiii ] and [ tableiv ] .",
    "the middle mn layer has a small spin moment of @xmath46/mn antiparallel to the larger one of 1.74 @xmath25/mn in the interfacial mn layer .",
    "it mediates a superexchange ferrimagnetic coupling between the interfacial and subsurface mn layers .",
    "note that the interlayer magnetic coupling is weak in the @xmath32(si - mn)/si(001 ) thin films , e.g. , the energy cost for flipping the magnetic moments of one layer , i.e. , going from fm to afm ordering between layers , is 8 and 10 mev / mn in the 2(si - mn)/si(001 ) and 3(si - mn)/si(001 ) films , respectively .",

    "moreover , the various magnetic mnsi films we studied have a spin polarization of carriers at the fermi level in the range of 3050%.@xcite these results imply that the ultrathin mnsi film on si(001 ) is a candidate for magnetoelectronic materials .    for the ( si - fe)/si(001 ) film ,",
    "our calculations find the afm state to be unstable and to converge to the fm ground state ( with a very small spin moment , as seen in tables  [ tableiii ] and [ tableiv ] ) .",
    "however , the fm state and the nm state are energetically degenerate , as seen in table  [ tableiv ] .",
    "similarly , the fm state of the 2(si - fe)/si(001 ) and 3(si - fe)/si(001 ) films has a small spin moment and almost the same energy as the nm state , the energy difference being less than 5 mev / fe .",
    "therefore we conclude that the fesi / si(001 ) films are nm , like the cscl - like fesi bulk , as discussed in sec .",
    "the nisi / si(001 ) film is also nm , as evidenced by our computational results that both fm and afm states converge to the nm ground state .    in strong contrast to the nm fesi and nisi films on si(001 ) , the cosi films on si(001 )",
    "have a fm ground state .",
    "this is evident from the magnetic moments reported in table  [ tableiii ] and from the energetics reported in table  [ tableiv ] . in our calculations ,",
    "a hypothetical afm state of ( si - co)/si(001 ) converges to a nm state which is , however , higher in total energy than the fm ground state by 15 mev / co .",
    "the 3(si - co)/si(001 ) film is also fm with a sizable spin moment in the middle layer ( well comparable with the bulk value of 0.63 @xmath25/co ) , unlike the _ ferrimagnetic _ 3(si - mn)/si(001 ) film . for 3(si - co)/si(001 ) , the layered afm state is higher in total energy than the fm ground state by 10 mev / co . moreover , our calculations find an increasing energy difference between the fm ground state and the nm state : 15 , 17 and 28 mev / co in the ( si - co ) , 2(si - co ) and 3(si - co)/si(001 ) films , respectively .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "4 the layer - resolved dos of the fm 3(si - co ) overlayers .",
    "the fermi level is found to be close to a minimum of the co @xmath2 dos .",
    "obviously the high dos at the fermi level seen in fig .",
    "2 for hypothetical nm cosi has transformed into a minimum of the fm dos due to exchange splitting .",
    "for this reason , the fm state is stable . analyzing the dos projected onto each si overlayer",
    ", we find a considerable spin polarization of carriers at the fermi level in the interior and near - interface si overlayers , although those si atoms themselves possess only a tiny induced spin moment .",
    "these results suggest that the cscl - like cosi / si(001 ) films are interesting materials systems , having a high thermodynamic stability among the @xmath0si / si(001 ) films ( see table  [ tablei ] ) and a fm metallic ground state .",
    "since the epitaxial growth of the cscl - like cosi film on si(111 ) has already been achieved,@xcite attempting to grow a cosi / si(001 ) film may be worth the experimental effort .",
    "moreover , the predicted ferromagnetism of the cscl - like cosi calls for experimental investigations.@xcite      in this section , we study films of the heusler alloys @xmath1mnsi ( @xmath0=fe , co , ni ) , which one can think of as being formed by partial mn substitution for si in the cscl - like @xmath0si films ( cf .",
    "1 ) described so far . in particular , the heusler alloy co@xmath3mnsi is of interest here , since its bulk fm half - metallicity predicted by band calculations attracts much attention both from the experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite side .",
    "bulk fe@xmath3mnsi , in an ideal fm state , is also predicted by band calculations to be half - metallic.@xcite however , calculations allowing for non - collinear alignment of the magnetic moments have found that , in the ground state , the mn magnetic moments are canted with respect to the direction of the fe magnetic moments,@xcite which leads to partial compensation of the magnetic moments along the [ 111 ] axis .",
    "the hypothetical compound ni@xmath3mnsi , which has not been synthesized so far to our knowledge , is shown by our calculations _ not _ to be half metallic .",
    "for the co@xmath3mnsi(001 ) surface , it has been shown recently by means of dft calculations@xcite that the termination by a mn - si crystal plane is thermodynamically stable , but a purely mn- or purely si - terminated surface can be stable as well under very mn - rich or under very si - rich conditions , respectively .    the goal of this work is to investigate how finite - size effects and epitaxial strain in very thin films affect the magnetic properties . the latter effect , lowering the crystallographic symmetry , could possibly change the half - metallicity of co@xmath3mnsi and fe@xmath3mnsi films . in particular , we investigate how possible surface and interface electronic states affect the electronic and magnetic properties of the films .",
    "to this end , we perform systematic studies as a function of film thickness .",
    "moreover , we consider various possibilities for the surface termination of the films , either si surface termination [ cf .",
    "5(a ) and 5(b ) ] or mnsi termination [ cf",
    "5(c ) , 5(d ) , and 5(e ) ] .",
    "note that the @xmath0=fe , co , or ni termination is energetically unfavorable for reasons discussed in the previous section , and thus disregarded in this work .",
    "in addition to the two types of surface termination , two types of interfaces are studied , namely the @xmath0/si interface ( cf .",
    "fig . 5 ) and the mnsi / si interface .",
    "the latter is characterized by extra mn atoms occupying the interstitial sites of the interfacial si layer ( not shown ) .",
    "firstly , we study the @xmath1mnsi / si(001 ) films with si termination and @xmath0/si interface .",
    "secondly , we deal with films with mnsi termination and @xmath0/si interface .",
    "thirdly , we discuss also the mnsi / si interface , but restrict ourselves to co@xmath3mnsi / si(001 ) films , since they are thermodynamically stable and have a robust fm metallic ground state , as seen below , and hence are most relevant .",
    "mnsi ( @xmath0=fe , co , ni ) films on si(001 ) with @xmath0/si interface , and of the mnsi - terminated one - layered ( c ) , two - layered ( d ) , and three - layered ( e ) @xmath1mnsi films .",
    "black balls represent @xmath0 , gray balls si , and large white balls mn atoms .",
    "the bonds shorter than 2.65   are shown.,width=302 ]      in this section , we use the terms two - layered [ cf .",
    "5(a ) ] and three - layered [ cf . fig .",
    "5(b ) ] heusler alloy films , according to the film thickness measured in repetition periods of the atomic superstructure of the alloy .",
    "firstly , we discuss the results for the two- and three - layered films , focussing on magnetic ordering .",
    "independent on composition , we find for all the two - layered @xmath1mnsi films a metallic ground state with fm coupling both in the mn sublattice and between the mn- and @xmath0-sublattices ( @xmath0=fe , co , ni ) . for fe@xmath3mnsi , afm ordering among the magnetic moments of fe and mn is metastable , but higher than the fm state in total energy by 20 mev per ( 1@xmath71 ) cell . for the co@xmath3mnsi and ni@xmath3mnsi films ,",
    "however , afm ordering of the magnetic moments of the co and mn ( or of ni and mn , respectively ) is found to be unstable , and the calculations converge to the fm ground state .",
    "moreover , our results show that the effective mn - mn fm coupling is strong , since the calculated energy cost to flip a mn - mn spin pair from parallel to anti - parallel orientation is as high as 73 mev / mn in fe@xmath3mnsi , 216 mev / mn in co@xmath3mnsi , and 80 mev / mn in ni@xmath3mnsi .",
    "note that in the two - layered @xmath1mnsi films , the mn atoms have the same environment as in the bulk .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that the calculated mn - mn coupling strengths approximately scale with the measured fm curie temperatures of 219 k for fe@xmath3mnsi , 985 k for co@xmath3mnsi , and 320 , 344 , and 380  k for ni@xmath3mn@xmath4 ( @xmath4=sn , ge , ga , respectively).@xcite    secondly , we analyze the spin magnetic moments in the films ( see table v ) . on the one hand ,",
    "the mn spin moment , being generally larger than 2 @xmath25 , increases in the @xmath1mnsi films as @xmath0 varies from fe through co to ni , following the same trend as in the bulk materials .",
    "this finding can be at least partly ascribed to decreasing @xmath28-@xmath28 hybridization among mn and the neighboring transition metal atoms when going from fe to ni , in accordance with the increasing energy separation between the mn @xmath2 and @xmath0 @xmath2 orbitals ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "on the other hand , one can argue that the mn spin moment in the @xmath1mnsi / si(001 ) films is still smaller than that in the @xmath1mnsi bulk .",
    "again , this can be explained by stronger in - plane @xmath28-@xmath28 hybridization in the film compared to the bulk , which gives rise to more delocalized planar electronic states and a reduced magnetic moment .",
    "the reason for this anisotropy is that the lattice constant of bulk si is about 4% smaller than that of cubic @xmath1mnsi .",
    "hence the @xmath1mnsi films have reduced planar lattice constant under the epitaxial constraint .",
    "the transition metal atom @xmath0(=fe , co , ni ) has a spin moment less than 1 @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , the si atom in the mnsi layer has a small induced spin moment which is opposite to the spin moment of the neighboring metal atom , and generally smaller than 0.05 @xmath25/si . the substrate si atoms have an even smaller spin moment of less than 0.02 @xmath25/si oscillating in its orientation between one substrate layer and the next one .    lccccccccccc + si - term.&@xmath0&si4&si3&si2&si1&@xmath0&mnsi&@xmath0&mnsi&@xmath0&si + & fe&0.003&0.001&0.015&0.007&&&0.61&2.24/0.02&0.36&0.14 + 2l&co&0.005&0.005&0.013&0.005&&&0.55&2.77/0.04&0.70&0.01 + & ni&0.002&0.006&0.002&0.009&&&0.14&3.06/0.04&0.13&0.02 + & fe&0.001&0&0.011&0&0.20&2.20/0.01&0.21&2.31/0.01&0.35&0.08 + 3l&co&0.004&0.005&0.007&0.006&0.53&2.74/0.04&0.95&2.72/0.04&0.71&0.01 + & ni&0&0.003&0.004&0.007&0.16&3.03/0.03&0.28&3.14/0.04&0.12&0.02 + mnsi - term.&@xmath0&si4&si3&si2&si1&@xmath0&mnsi&@xmath0&mnsi&@xmath0&mnsi + & fe&0.001&0&0.010&0.005&&&&&0.84&3.42/0.10 + 1l&co&0&0.002&0.005&0&&&&&0.42&3.56/0.10 + & ni&0.001&0.002&0.001&0.007&&&&&0.02&3.58/0.10 + & fe&0.002&0.002&0.018&0.010&&&0.64&2.09/0.02&0.06&3.45/0.10 + 2l&co&0.005&0.004&0.013&0.011&&&0.54&2.65/0.05&0.82&3.52/0.12 + & ni&0.001&0.004&0.001&0.005&&&0.18&3.05/0.03&0.23&3.63/0.10 + & fe&0.001&0.002&0.011&0.007&0.47&2.21/0.02&0.01&2.17/0&0.18&3.50/0.11 + 3l&co&0.004&0.003&0.008&0.013&0.52&2.70/0.04&0.99&2.73/0.04&0.86&3.53/0.11 + & ni&0&0.003&0.002&0.006&0.15&3.06/0.03&0.29&3.12/0.04&0.17&3.61/0.11 + bulk @xmath1mnsi&@xmath0&mn&si + fe@xmath3mnsi&0.083&2.769&0 + co@xmath3mnsi&0.987&3.013&0.039 + ni@xmath3mnsi&0.290&3.330&0.028 +    mnsi ( a ) , co@xmath3mnsi ( b ) and ni@xmath3mnsi ( c ) films on si(001 ) with @xmath0/si ( @xmath0=fe , co , or ni ) interface . in each panel , the overlayers are shown from surface ( top ) to interface ( bottom ) for the atomic structure depicted in fig .",

    "besides the strong fm mn - mn intralayer coupling discussed above , the interlayer mn - mn coupling ( evaluated by switching the relative orientation of the magnetic moment in two neighboring mnsi layers in the supercell ) is 4 mev / mn in the fe@xmath3mnsi film , 167 mev / mn in co@xmath3mnsi , and 30 mev / mn in ni@xmath3mnsi .",
    "the reduced interlayer coupling can be at least partly ascribed to a tetragonal distortion , by noting that the heusler alloy film is under compressive epitaxial strain on si(001 ) , as stated above , and thus has an enlarged spacing between layers .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0 spin , which mediates the effective mn - mn coupling , plays an important role for the magnetic ordering . note that in the three - layered @xmath1mnsi films , the @xmath0 atoms in the layer sandwiched between two mnsi layers have an averaged spin moment of 0.21 @xmath25/fe , 0.95 @xmath25/co , and 0.28 @xmath25/ni , as seen from table v. in contrast to this , we observe that for the layered afm ordering of the mn spins , the co spin in the middle layer is quenched to a value close to zero .",
    "the vanishing of the co spin moment in the layered afm state , sitting between two spin - antiparallel mnsi layers , is simply a consequence of symmetry .",
    "the highest energy cost of switching from fm to afm alignment of the mn spins correlates with the largest magnetic moment at co in the fm state in the three heusler alloys studied here .",
    "this indicates that the quenching of the co spin moment is energetically unfavourable and hence the fm state is preferred over the afm state .",
    "next , we investigate if the half - metallic properties of the co@xmath3mnsi and fe@xmath3mnsi bulk materials also show up in the thin films . in fig .  6 , the overlayer - resolved dos of the si - terminated three - layered @xmath1mnsi ( @xmath0=fe , co , ni ) films on si(001 ) is shown .",
    "generally , the films do not show a gap in the dos at the fermi level .",
    "however , the spin - polarization at the fermi level is high in the three middle layers , mnsi - fe - mnsi or mnsi - co - mnsi . we interpret this as an incipient recovery of the half - metallicity of the bulk fe@xmath3mnsi and co@xmath3mnsi .",
    "however , in the ni@xmath3mnsi film , this is not the case , consistent with our finding that bulk ni@xmath3mnsi is _ not _ half - metallic . in all the @xmath1mnsi films studied here",
    ", the surface si layer has a sizable spin - polarization ( @xmath4930% ) at the fermi level , following the definition in ref . 5 , while the subsurface @xmath0 and the interfacial @xmath0 layers have only low spin - polarization ( @xmath5010% ) at the fermi level ( except for @xmath5120% for the interfacial ni layer ) .    finally , we turn to the subject of thermodynamic stability . by calculating the formation energy using eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we conclude that all si - terminated two- and three - layered @xmath1mnsi films on si(001 ) are stable against a decomposition into the clean si(001 ) surface and bulk tms .",
    "this is indicated by their negative @xmath33 values , as seen in table vi .",
    "moreover , we checked the stability of the @xmath1mnsi films against separated @xmath0si and mnsi films by calculating the heat of reaction , @xmath52e , defined by @xmath53 the @xmath1mnsi films is stable ( unstable ) if @xmath52e is positive ( negative ) . as shown by our results summarized in table vi ,",

    "the two - layered co@xmath3mnsi film is stable while the three - layered one tends to be unstable .",
    "however , the ni@xmath3mnsi film is stable against a phase separation into the nisi and mnsi films .",

    "the spin moment of the @xmath0 atom sandwiching two mnsi layers , which plays an important role in the effective mn - mn coupling , is less than 0.2 @xmath25/fe , about 0.8 - 1.0  @xmath25/co or 0.2 - 0.3  @xmath25/ni .",

    "our calculations show that for pseudomorphic @xmath0si films on si(001 ) , si surface termination is energetically preferred because it optimizes the surface valence bond structure , i.e. , four - fold coordination of surface si and seven- or eight - fold coordination of subsurface @xmath0 atoms are achieved .",
    "the @xmath0-si chemical bond becomes stronger as @xmath0 varies from mn through fe and co to ni , due to decreasing @xmath0 @xmath2si @xmath26 energy separation , and hence increasing hybridization of the metal @xmath2-states with the si valence band .",
    "the calculated variations in thermodynamic stability of the @xmath0si / si(001 ) films can be accounted for in terms of both the @xmath0 @xmath2si @xmath26 energy separation and the @xmath0 @xmath2 orbital occupation .",
    "these trends for the bond strength also enable us to rationalize the observed atomic ordering in heusler alloys and to explain the experimentally observed site preference of transition metal impurities added to heusler alloys .",

    "the slightly less stable si termination , once formed , is long - lived , since removing si atoms is energetically more costly than removing mn atoms . except for the atoms in the surface and interface layers , we find that the electronic structure known from the bulk samples is recovered quickly in the interior of the overlayers .",
    "in particular , the half - metallicity of bulk fe@xmath3mnsi and co@xmath3mnsi is almost recovered in the three middle layers of the films investigated . as far as magnetic ordering in the @xmath1mnsi films is concerned , we find that the effective intralayer mn - mn fm couplings mediated by the first - neighbor @xmath0 atoms are strong and approximately scale with the measured curie temperatures of the corresponding bulk @xmath1mnsi samples .",
    "the interlayer mn - mn fm coupling remains strong in the co@xmath3mnsi films while it is ( much ) reduced in the ni@xmath3mnsi ( fe@xmath3mnsi ) films .",
    "the co@xmath3mnsi / si(001 ) thin film is thermodynamically stable and has a robust fm metallic ground state , and thus is most relevant for possible applications .",
    "however , by analyzing our calculations we also identify two effects that could possibly be detrimental for use of these films for spin injection : the co / si and mnsi / si interfaces are found to have a similar formation energy , which makes thermally induced interfacial disorder likely ; and the interfacial co or mnsi layer does nt display the gap in the layer - resolved dos of the minority spin channel characteristic for a half - metal .",
