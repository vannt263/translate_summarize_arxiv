    "the harmonic oscillator is one of the models most extensively used in both classical and quantum mechanics .",
    "the usefulness and simplicity make this model a subject of lots of studies .",
    "one of the most important aspects of quantum harmonic oscillator ( qho ) is its dynamic algebra i.e. weyl - heisenberg algebra .",
    "this algebra appears in many areas of modern theoretical physics , as an example we notice that the one - dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator was successfully used in second quantization formalism @xcite .",
    "+ due to the relevance of weyl - heisenberg algebra , some efforts have been devoted to studying possible deformations of the qho algebra @xcite .",
    "a deformed algebra is a nontrivial generalization of a given algebra through the introduction of one or more deformation parameters , such that , in a certain limit of parameters the non - deformed algebra is recovered .",
    "a particular deformation of heisenberg algebra has led to the notion of @xmath0-oscillator @xcite .",
    "an @xmath0-oscillator is a non - harmonic system , that from mathematical point of view its dynamical variables ( creation and annihilation operators ) are constructed from a non canonical transformation through @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the usual ( non - deformed ) harmonic oscillator operators with @xmath4=1 $ ] and @xmath5 .",
    "the function @xmath6 is called deformation function which depends on the number of excitation quanta and some physical parameters .",
    "the presence of the operator - valued deformation function causes the heisenberg algebra of the standard qho to transform into a deformed heisenberg algebra .",
    "the nonlinearity in @xmath0-oscillators means dependence of the oscillation frequency on the intensity @xcite . on the other hand , in contrast to the standard qho",
    ", @xmath0-oscillators have not equal spaced energy spectrum .",
    "for example , if we confine a simple qho inside an infinite well , due to the spatial confinement , the energy levels constitute a spectrum that is not equal spaced .",
    "therefore , in this case it is reasonable to investigate the corresponding @xmath0-oscillator .",
    "+ the confined qho can be used to describe confinement effects on physical properties of confined systems .",
    "physical size and shape of the materials strongly affect the nature , dynamics of the electronic excitations , lattice vibrations , and dynamics of carriers .",
    "for example , in the mesoscopic systems , the dimension of system is comparable with the coherence length of carriers and this leads to some new phenomena that they do not appear in a bulk semiconductor , such as quantum interference between carrier s motion @xcite .",
    "recent progress in growth techniques and development of micromachinig technology in designing mesoscopic systems and nanostructures , have led to intensive theoretical @xcite and experimental investigations @xcite on electronic and optical properties of those systems .",
    "the most important point about the nanoscale structures is that the quantum confinement effects play the center - stone role .",
    "one can even say , in general , that recent success in nanofabrication technique have resulted in great interest in various artificial physical systems ( quantum dots , quantum wires and quantum wells ) with new phenomena driven by the quantum confinement .",
    "a number of recent experiments have demonstrated that isolated semiconductor quantum dots are capable of emitting light @xcite .",
    "it becomes possible to combine high - q optical microcavities with quantum dot emitters as the active medium @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are many theoretical attempts for understanding the optical and electronic properties of nanostructures especially semiconductor quantum dots @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a nanostructure such as quantum dot , is a system that carrier s motion is confined inside a small region , and during the interaction with other systems , the generated excitations such as phonons , excitons and plasmons are confined in small region . in order to describe the physical properties of these excitations one can consider them as harmonic oscillator . + as another application of deformed algebra",
    "we can refer to the notion of parastatistics @xcite .",
    "the concept of parastatistics has found many application in fractal statistics and anyon theory @xcite .",
    "in addition to the anyon theory , the parastatistics has found many interesting application in supersymmetry and non - commutative quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "+ the construction of generalized deformed oscillators corresponding to well - known potentials and study of the correspondence between the properties of the conventional potential picture and the algebraic one has been done @xcite . recently , the generalized deformed algebra and its associated generalized operators have been considered @xcite . by looking at the classical correspondence of the hamiltonian , the potential energy and the effective mass function is obtained . in this contribution",
    "we derive the generalized operators associated with a definite potential by comparing the physical properties of system and physical results of generalized algebra .",
    "+ one of the most interesting features of the qho is the construction of its coherent states as the eigenfunctions of the annihilation operator .",
    "as is well known @xcite , one can introduce nonlinear coherent states ( nlcss ) or @xmath0-coherent states as the right - hand eigenstates of the deformed annihilation operator @xmath7 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that these families of generalized coherent states exhibit various non - classical properties . due to",
    "these properties and their applications , generation of these states is a very important issue in the context of quantum optics .",
    "the @xmath0-coherent states may appear as stationary states of the center - of - mass motion of a trapped ion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a theoretical scheme for generation of these states in a coherently pumped micromaser within the frame - work of intensity - dependent jaynes - cummings model has been proposed @xcite .",
    "+ one of the most important questions is the physical meaning of the deformation in the nlcss theory .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that there is a close connection between the deformation function appeared in the algebraic structure of nlcss and the non - commutative geometry of the configuration space .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown recently @xcite , that a two - mode qho confined on the surface of a sphere , can be interpreted as a single mode deformed oscillator , whose quantum statistics depends on the curvature of sphere .",
    "+ motivated by the above - mentioned studies , in the present contribution we are intended to investigate the spatial confinement effects on physical properties of a standard qho .",
    "it will be shown that the spatial confinement leads to deformation of standard qho .",
    "we consider a qho confined in a one - dimensional infinite well without periodic boundary conditions , and we find its energy levels , as well as associated ladder operators .",
    "we show that the ladder operators can be interpreted as a special kind of the so - called @xmath0-deformed creation and annihilation operators @xcite .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we review some physical properties of @xmath0-oscillator and its coherent states . in section 3",
    "we consider the spatially confined qho in a one - dimensional infinite well and construct its associated coherent states .",
    "we shall also examine some of their quantum statistical properties , including sub - poissonian statistics and quadrature squeezing .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "in this section , we review the basics of the @xmath0-deformed quantum oscillator and the associated coherent states known in the literature as nonlinear coherent states . in the first step , to investigate one of the sources of deformation we consider an eigenvalue problem for a given quantum physical system and we focus our attention on the properties of creation and annihilation operators , that allow to make transition between the states of discrete spectrum of the system hamiltonian @xcite . as usual , we expand the hamiltonian in its eigenvectors @xmath8 where we have choosed @xmath9 .",
    "we introduce the creation ( raising ) and annihilation ( lowering ) operators as follows @xmath10 so that @xmath11 .",
    "these ladder operators satisfy the following commutation relation @xmath12=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}(e_{i+1}-e_{i})|i\\rangle\\langle i|\\:.\\ ] ] obviously if the energy spectrum is equally spaced that is , it should be linear in quantum numbers , as in the case of ordinary qho , then @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a constant and in this condition the commutator of @xmath2 and @xmath3 becomes a constant ( a rescaled weyl - heisenberg algebra ) .",
    "on the other hand , if the energy spectrum is not equally spaced , the ladder operators of the system satisfy a deformed heisenberg algebra , i.e. their commutator depends on the quantum numbers that appear in the energy spectrum .",
    "this is one of the most important properties of the quantum @xmath0-oscillators @xcite .",
    "+ an @xmath0-oscillator is a non - harmonic system characterized by a hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator form @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) with a specific frequency @xmath17 and deformed boson creation and annihilation operators defined in ( [ defo ] ) .",
    "the deformed operators obey the commutation relation @xmath18=(\\hat{n}+1)f^2(\\hat{n}+1)-\\hat{n}f^2(\\hat{n})\\:.\\ ] ] the @xmath0-deformed hamiltonian @xmath19 is diagonal on the eingenstates @xmath20 in the fock space and its eigenvalues are @xmath21.\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath22 , the ordinary expression @xmath23 and the usual ( non - deformed ) commutation relation @xmath24=1 $ ] are recovered .",
    "+ furthermore , by using the heisenberg equation of motion with hamiltonian ( [ hami ] ) @xmath25,\\ ] ] we obtain the following solution for the @xmath0-deformed operators @xmath7 and @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 in this sense , the @xmath0-deformed oscillator can be interpreted as a nonlinear oscillator whose frequency of vibrations depends explicitly on its number of excitation quanta @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to point out that recent studies have revealed strictly physical relationship between the nonlinearity concept resulting from the @xmath0-deformation and some nonlinear optical effects , e.g. , kerr nonlinearity , in the context of atom - field interaction @xcite .",
    "+ the nonlinear transformation of the creation and annihilation operators leads naturally to the notion of nonlinear coherent states or @xmath0-coherent states .",
    "the nonlinear coherent states @xmath29 are defined as the right - hand eigenstates of the deformed operator @xmath30 from eq.([coh ] ) one can obtain an explicit form of the nonlinear coherent states in a number state representation @xmath31 where the coefficients @xmath32 s and normalization constant @xmath33 are , respectively , given by @xmath34!\\right)^{-1}\\hspace{0.5cm},\\hspace{0.5 cm } [ f(n)]!=\\prod_{j=1}^nf(j),\\nonumber \\\\ c&=&\\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty } d_n^2|\\alpha|^{2n}\\right)^{\\frac{-1}{2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in recent years the nonlinear coherent states have been paid much attentions because they exhibit nonclassical features @xcite and many quantum optical states , such as squeezed states , phase states , negative binomial states and photon - added coherent states can be viewed as a sort of nonlinear coherent states @xcite .",
    "in this section we consider a quantum harmonic oscillator confined in a one dimensional infinite well .",
    "many attempts have been done for solving this problem ( see @xcite,@xcite , and references therein ) . in most of those works , authors tried to solve the problem numerically . but",
    "in our consideration we try to solve the problem analytically , to reveal the relationship between the confinement effect and given deformation function .",
    "we start from the schrdinger equation ( @xmath35 ) @xmath36\\psi(x)=e\\psi(x),\\ ] ] where @xmath37 according to the approach introduced in previous section , we can obtain raising and lowering operators from the spectrum of schrdinger operator . on the other hand , by comparing the energy spectrum of particular system with energy spectrum of general @xmath0-deformed oscillator ( [ energy ] ) , one could obtain deformed raising and lowering operators .",
    "hence , we need an analytical expression for energy spectrum of the system which explicitly shows dependence on special quantum numbers . the original problem , confined qho ( [ shshsh ] ) , can be solved only by using the approximation methods .",
    "when applying perturbation theory , one is usually concern with a small perturbation of an exactly solvable hamiltonian system . in the case of confined qho",
    "we deal with three limits . inside the well , for small values of position we have harmonic oscillator , for large values we have an infinite well and at the positions of the boundaries the two potentials have the same power .",
    "hence the approximation method can not lead to acceptable results .",
    "therefore , we model the original problem by a model potential that has mathematical behavior such as confined qho . instead of solving the schrdinger equation for the qho confined between infinite rectangular walls in positions @xmath38 , we propose to solve the eigenvalue problem for the potential @xmath39 where @xmath40 , is a scaling factor depending on the width of the well .",
    "this potential models a qho placed in the center of the rectangular infinite well @xcite .",
    "the potential @xmath41 ( [ pot ] ) fulfills two asymptotic requirements : 1 ) @xmath42 when @xmath43 ( free harmonic oscillator limit ) .",
    "2 ) @xmath41 at equilibrium position has the same curvature as a free qho , @xmath44_{x=0}=k$ ] .",
    "this model potential belongs to the exactly solvable trigonometric pschl - teller potentials family @xcite .",
    "stationary coherent states for special kind of this potential have been considered @xcite .",
    "+ now we consider the following equation @xmath45\\psi(x)=0\\;.\\ ] ] to solve analytically this equation , we use the factorization method @xcite . by changing the variable and some mathematical manipulation ,",
    "the corresponding energy eigenvalues are found as @xmath46 where @xmath47,and @xmath48 is the frequency of the qho .",
    "the first term in the energy spectrum can be interpreted as the energy of a free particle in a well , the second term denotes the energy spectrum of the qho , and the last term shifts the energy spectrum by a constant amount .",
    "it is evident that if @xmath43 then @xmath49 and the energy spectrum ( [ eee ] ) reduces to the spectrum of a free qho .",
    "as is clear from ( [ eee ] ) , different energy levels are not equally spaced .",
    "hence , confining a free qho leads to deformation of its dynamical algebra and we can interpret the parameter @xmath50 as the corresponding deformation parameter . in table",
    "[ table ] the numerical results associated with the original potential , given in ref .",
    "@xcite , are compared with the generated results from the model potential under consideration .",
    "as is seen , the results are in a good agreement when boundary size is of order of characteristic length of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "the original oscillator potential when approaches to the boundaries of the well becomes infinite suddenly , while the model potential is smooth and approaches to the infinity asymptotically .",
    "therefore , the model potential ( [ pot ] ) is more appropriate for the physical systems .",
    "+ if we normalize eq.([eee ] ) to energy quanta of the simple harmonic oscillator and introduce the new variables @xmath51 ,",
    "@xmath52 , and @xmath53 then it takes the following form @xmath54 by comparing this spectrum with the energy spectrum of an @xmath0-deformed oscillator , given by ( [ energy ] ) , we find the corresponding deformation function as @xmath55 furthermore , the ladder operators associated with the confined oscillator under consideration can be written in terms of the conventional ( non - deformed ) operators @xmath2 , @xmath3 as follows @xmath56 these two operators satisfy the following commutation relation @xmath57=\\gamma'(2\\hat{n}+1)+\\eta.\\ ] ] it is obvious that in the limiting case @xmath43 ( @xmath58,@xmath59 ) , the right hand side of the above commutation relation becomes independent of @xmath60 , and the deformed algebra reduces to a the conventional weyl - heisenberg algebra for a free qho .",
    "+ classically , harmonic oscillator is a particle that attached to an ideal spring , and can oscillate with specific amplitude . when that particle be confined",
    ", boundaries can affect particle s motion if the boundaries position be in a smaller distance in comparison with a characteristic length that particle oscillates within it .",
    "this characteristic length for the qho is given by @xmath61 @xmath62 , and if @xmath63 , then the presence of the boundaries affects the behavior of qho , otherwise it behaves like a free qho .",
    "therefore , one can interpret @xmath64 as a scale length where the deformation effects become relevant .",
    "now , we focus our attention on the coherent states associated with the qho under consideration . as usual",
    ", we define coherent states as the right - hand eigenstates of the deformed annihilation operator @xmath65 from ( [ nlcs ] ) and using the nlcs formalism introduced in ( [ coh])-([coh1 ] ) the explicit form of the corresponding nlcs of the confined qho is written as @xmath66 where @xmath67 ^ 2n!}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] is the normalization factor , @xmath68 is a complex number , and the deformation function @xmath69 is given by eq.([f1f ] ) .",
    "the ensemble of states @xmath70 labeled by the single complex number @xmath68 is called a set of coherent states if the following conditions are satisfied @xcite :    * normalizability @xmath71 * continuity in the label @xmath68 @xmath72 * resolution of the identity @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a proper measure that ensures the completeness and the integration is restricted to the part of the complex plane where normalization converges .    the first two conditions can be proved easily . for the third condition",
    ", we choose the normalization constant as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is similar to the modified bessel function of the first kind of the order @xmath77 with the series expansion @xmath78 .",
    "resolution of the identity of the deformed coherent states @xmath70 can be written as @xmath79 now we introduce the new variable @xmath80 and the measure @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the modified bessel function of the second kind of the order @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 . using the integral relation @xmath86 @xcite , we obtain @xmath87 we therefore conclude that the states @xmath70 qualify as coherent states in the sense described by the conditions ( [ c1])-([mmm ] ) .",
    "+ we now proceed to examine some nonclassical properties of the nonlinear coherent states @xmath70 . as an important quantity , we consider the variance of the number operator @xmath60 .",
    "since for the coherent states the variance of number operator is equal to its average , deviation from the poissonian statistics can be measured with the mandel parameter @xcite @xmath88 this parameter vanishes for the poisson distribution , is positive for the super - poissonian distribution ( bunching effect ) , and is negative for the sub - poissonian distribution ( antibunchig effect ) . fig .",
    "[ f1 ] shows the size dependence of the mandel parameter for different values of @xmath89 .",
    "as is seen , the mandel parameter exhibits the sub - poissonian statistics and with further increasing values of @xmath90 it is finally stabilized at an asymptotical zero value corresponding to the poissonian statistics . in addition , the smaller the parameter @xmath89 is , the more rapidly the mandel parameter tends to the poissonian statistics . + as another important nonclassical property we examine the quadrature squeezing . for this purpose",
    "we first consider the conventional quadrature operators @xmath91 and @xmath92 defined in terms of nondeformed operators @xmath2 and @xmath93 as @xcite @xmath94 in this equation , @xmath95 is the phase of quadrature operators which can effectivly affect the squeezing properties .",
