    "infrared ( ir ) bright galaxies were first identified almost 40 years ago @xcite .",
    "the _ iras _",
    "satellite detected a large number of these galaxies in the local universe ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "galaxies were classified according to their ir ( @xmath5 m ) luminosities into luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs , @xmath6 ) and ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , @xmath7 ) .",
    "since then , an increasing number of studies showed the important role of ( u)lirgs at cosmological distances .",
    "lirgs and ulirgs are not common in the local universe , accounting for just @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , of the total ir emission of galaxies . however , at z@xmath31 ,",
    "lirgs dominate the ir background and the co - moving star formation rate density , while ulirgs are dominant at z@xmath32 @xcite .",
    "thanks to the high sensitivity of the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) @xcite on - board , we can , for the first time , study systematically the mid - ir properties of ( u)lirgs , both locally and at high-@xmath10 .",
    "the majority of irs local studies have , so far , focused on the properties of starburst galaxies @xcite and ulirgs @xcite .",
    "the latter class of galaxies includes a large variety of physical and excitation conditions .",
    "for instance , most of these local ( @xmath11 ) ulirgs are powered predominantly by compact starburst events , although a substantial agn contribution is present in about half of them @xcite . in the future the larger sample ( @xmath3200 ) of local lirgs of the spitzer legacy program goals will enable a statistical study of this class of galaxies @xcite .",
    "although ulirgs at z@xmath32 extend to even higher luminosities than local ones , their mid - ir spectra are similar to those of local starbursts , rather than to local ulirgs @xcite .",
    "a similar behavior is found for high - z submillimeter galaxies @xcite .",
    "this behavior may indicate that star formation in ir - bright galaxies at z@xmath32 is taking place over larger scales ( a few kpc ) than in local ulirgs , where most of the ir emission arises from very compact regions ( sub - kiloparsec scales , see e.g. , @xcite ) .    as a result",
    ", local lirgs may provide important insights to the behavior of high - redshift ulirgs .",
    "their star formation is often distributed over a substantial fraction of the galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and in any case is usually not embedded at the high optical depths characteristic of the nuclear star forming regions in local ulirgs . to make good use of this analogy requires observations that map the local lirgs to get an understanding of their global properties as well as to provide a better comparison with the observations of high - z galaxies , where the entire galaxy is encompassed in the irs slit .",
    "the spectral mapping mode of /irs is well suited for this purpose , since it can provide both the nuclear and integrated spectra of local galaxies , enabling study of the spatial distribution of the spectral features that make up the integrated spectrum .",
    "this is the first in a series of papers studying the mid - ir properties of local lirgs .",
    "we present /irs spectral mapping observations of a representative sample of fifteen local lirgs .",
    "the first results and the goals of this program were presented by @xcite . in the present paper we focus on the analysis of the spatially resolved measurements .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "s : observations ] we present the sample and the observational details .",
    "section [ s : analysis ] describes the analysis of the data .",
    "we examine the silicate feature in section [ s : silicate ] .",
    "sections [ s : lines ] , [ s : pah ] , [ s : molecular_hydrogen ] discuss the spatially resolved properties of the atomic fine structure lines , pahs , and molecular hydrogen emission , respectively .",
    "we explore the velocity fields in section [ s : velocity_fields ] .",
    "finally , in section [ s : conclusions ] we summarize the main results . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath12 km s@xmath13mpc@xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the galaxies studied here were selected from the sample of 30 local lirgs described in @xcite , which was drawn from the iras revised bright galaxy sample ( rbgs , @xcite ) .",
    "the sample of @xcite is a volume limited sample , and the velocity range was selected so that the pa@xmath4 emission line could be observed with the nicmos f190n filter on - board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "this restricted the sample to local lirgs ( 40 mpc @xmath16 d @xmath16 75 mpc ) . from this sample we selected 15 galaxies ( table [ tbl_obs_map ] ) with extended emission in the nicmos pa@xmath4 images to be mapped with the irs spectrograph .",
    "this selection criterion does not introduce any bias in the luminosity , distance and nuclear activity distributions of the mapped galaxies as compared to the parent sample of @xcite .",
    "the remaining galaxies in the sample have been observed using the irs staring mode as part of different programs .",
    "the latter will be analyzed with the mapping data in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the interacting galaxy arp  299 was studied in detail by @xcite and will be included in the appropriate comparisons and figures in this paper .",
    "most of the nuclei of the lirgs in our sample are classified as hii  region - like from optical spectroscopy , 3 galaxies have a seyfert classification and 2 are classified as composite ( intermediate between hii  and liner , see @xcite ) .",
    "the infrared luminosity of the sample ranges from 10@xmath17 to 10@xmath18 l@xmath19 .",
    "the main properties of the galaxies are summarized in table [ tbl_obs_map ] .",

    "we used all four irs modules : high resolution ( r@xmath3600 ) modules with short - high ( sh ; 9.9 - 19.6 ) and long - high ( lh ; 18.7 - 37.2 ) , and low resolution ( r@xmath360 - 120 ) with short - low ( sl1 ; 7.4 - 14.5 , sl2 ; 5.2 - 7.7 ) and long - low ( ll1 ; 19.5 - 38.0 , ll2 ; 14.0 - 21.3 ) .",
    "maps were made by moving the telescope pointing position perpendicular to the long axis of the slit with a step size half of the slit width .",
    "the sl , ll and lh slits are long enough to cover the full region of interest with just one slit length , but due to the smaller size of sh slit , parallel steps were also needed .",
    "the parallel step size was half of the slit height .",
    "this strategy produced maps with a redundancy per pixel of 2 for sl , ll and lh , and 4 for sh .",
    "table [ tbl_obs_det ] details the integration time , pixel size and step size for each irs module . the maps",
    "cover at least the central 20@xmath2020  to 30@xmath2030  of the galaxies .",
    "dedicated background observations are not needed for the low resolution modules ( sl and ll ) because the separation on the sky between the two orders of each module is larger than the galaxy size . that is , when order one is on the galaxy , order two is observing the background and vice versa .",
    "the sh and lh slits are too small to allow background subtraction .",
    "we obtained dedicated background observations for lh by observing a region 2 arcminutes away from the galaxy .",
    "sh sky observations are available only for the galaxies observed under the program p40479 . for the galaxies without dedicated sh background observations , we estimated the sky background emission by combining the background spectra from the low resolution modules . generally the sky contribution is not very important for the galaxies in our sample , except for ngc  3110 and zw  049.057 .",
    "the sky background is bright at the position of these galaxies and its subtraction is essential to match the fluxes from the different slits .",
    "moreover , subtracting background observations is always useful because it removes many of the rogue pixels and improves the final quality of the spectra .",
    "this is especially important for the lh module since it contains a large number of such pixels .",
    "we used basic calibrated data ( bcd ) , processed by pipeline version s15.3 ( low resolution modules : sl and ll ) and version s17.2 ( high resolution modules : sh and lh ) to build data cubes with cubism @xcite .",
    "cubism is a tool that combines slit observations to create spectral cubes .",
    "it also performs background subtraction , flux calibration and estimates the statistical uncertainty at each spectral wavelength .",
    "using the sl cubes generated by cubism we constructed maps of the 5.5  continuum , and the most prominent aromatic features ( hereafter pah ) in this module ( ,  and ) . to build them we used our own idl procedures .",
    "first we extracted 1-d spectra from the cubes by averaging the spectra over a 2@xmath202 pixel aperture and then by moving with a 1 pixel step until the whole field of view was covered .",
    "the 2@xmath202 pixel extraction box allows us to increase the s / n of the 1-d spectra , with only a slight loss of angular resolution ( see below and appendix [ apxpsf ] ) .",
    "once we obtained the 1-d spectra , for each pixel we did the following . to create the 5.5  continuum map , we integrated the flux between the rest frame 5.3  and 5.7  wavelengths ( in this section all wavelengths refer to rest frame wavelengths ) .",
    "for the pah maps , first we fitted the local continuum using a linear fit .",
    "the continuum pivots were set by averaging the spectrum over a @xmath30.2  interval centered at 5.75  and 6.7  for the , at 7.2  and 8.2  for the , and at 10.6  and 11.8  for the . after subtracting the continuum , we integrated the flux in the wavelength ranges between 5.9 and 6.5 7.3 and 7.9  and 10.8 and 11.6  for the 6.2 , 7.7 and 11.3  pah features , respectively .",
    "we derived the flux uncertainty of these maps with the statistical uncertainties provided by cubism . to avoid noisy pixels , we required the feature peak to be at least above 1@xmath21 to plot that pixel in the map , where @xmath21 is the continuum noise .",
    "the sl spectral maps of our sample are shown in figure [ fig_map_sl ] .",
    "the angular resolution ( fwhm ) of the sl spectral maps is @xmath34.5 arcsec .",
    "this is the resolution when we use 2@xmath202 boxes to construct the maps , as opposed to that measured from the standard star observations ( see appendix [ apxpsf ] ) . for the distances of our galaxies",
    "corresponds to @xmath31 kpc ( the exact scale for each galaxy is given in table [ tbl_obs_map ] ) . in appendix [ apxpsf ]",
    "we give full details on how the angular resolution of the spectral maps was derived .",
    "we constructed maps of different pah ratios by dividing the pah maps obtained as described above . to avoid noisy pixels in the ratio maps we imposed further restrictions , and only those pixels with signal - to - noise ratio greater than 4",
    "are plotted in the pah ratio maps .",
    "figures [ fig_pah11pah6_sl ] and [ fig_pah11pah7_sl ] show the /  and /  ratios , respectively .",
    "we used the sh cubes to measure the brightest fine structure emission lines : , , ,  and the molecular hydrogen lines , at 12.3  and at 17.0 .",
    "first we extracted 1-d spectra using the same method as for the low resolution cubes .",
    "then we used the idl package mpfit @xcite to fit simultaneously a first - order polynomial to the continuum and a gaussian to the line .",
    "the fit was over a wavelength range of @xmath30.4  centered at the line wavelength .",
    "the spectral resolution , r@xmath3600 , is sufficiently high to allow us to separate the emission lines from the broad pah bands .",
    "however , to improve the continuum determination , we used extra gaussian profiles to fit the pah features close to the emission lines ( e.g. , the 12.7  pah feature next to the [ neii ] ) . to avoid noisy pixels in the maps , we required : ( 1 ) a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath22 in the continuum range ; and ( 2 ) the line peak to be at least 1@xmath21 above the continuum noise for the pixel to be shown in the corresponding map .",
    "we also constructed an  feature map by the same procedure as for sl cubes , but with the high resolution spectra .",
    "a 15  continuum was obtained by integrating the flux between 14.9  and 15.1 .",
    "we required a signal above 1@xmath21 to plot a pixel in these two maps .",
    "the sh spectral maps are shown in figure [ fig_map_sh ] together with the hst / nicmos continuum - subtracted pa@xmath4 maps of @xcite .",
    "we constructed / , /  and /  ratio maps by dividing the flux maps .",
    "the variation of the psf size with wavelength within each module is negligible ( see appendix [ apxpsf ] ) , and therefore we divided the flux maps directly without attempting to correct for this small effect ( we only built ratio maps of lines observed with the sh module ) .",
    "we imposed stricter conditions to plot a pixel in a ratio map than those used for the line maps ; only pixels with a flux measurement @xmath23 , for both features , were included in the ratio maps .",
    "the maps of the sh line ratios are shown in figure [ fig_co_sh ] .",
    "the angular resolution of the sh maps is @xmath36 arcsec .",
    "this corresponds to physical scales between @xmath31 kpc , for the nearest galaxies , and @xmath32 kpc for the most distant ones .",
    "we extracted 1-d spectra of the nuclei as well as of the integrated galaxy . to extract the nuclear spectra we used a 5.5@xmath205.5  square aperture centered at the nuclear coordinates ( table [ tbl_obs_map ] ) .",
    "this aperture corresponds to physical scales between 1 and 2 kpc , depending on the galaxy .",
    "we set the orientation of the aperture aligned with the r.a . and dec axis .",
    "we used the same aperture for both low and high resolution data cubes . to obtain the integrated spectrum we summed the flux of the cube .",
    "we excluded those pixels with the  flux ( 15  continuum ) below 1@xmath21 to avoid adding too much noise to the low resolution ( high resolution ) integrated spectra .",
    "this threshold is the same as that required to plot a pixel in the  and 15  continuum maps of figure [ fig_map_sl ] and figure [ fig_map_sh ] respectively .",
    "the physical scale of the integration area varies from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "the approximated physical sizes are listed in tables [ tbl_lowres_map ] and [ tbl_hires_map_integrated ] for the low and high resolution maps respectively .",
    "they are of the order of 10@xmath208 kpc .",
    "although the extraction regions are slightly different for each module , the flux differences are only @xmath310 - 20% .",
    "we plot the integrated spectra in figure [ fig_spects ] .",
    "the nuclear spectra will be presented in pereira - santaella et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , together with the nuclear spectra of the rest of the @xcite sample .    in figure [ fig_spects_mapping ] ( right )",
    "we show a comparison of the nuclear and extranuclear low resolution spectra normalized at 14  for 4 of the galaxies .",
    "we selected these galaxies because in their spectral maps ( left panel of figure [ fig_spects_mapping ] ) it is possible to identify extranuclear hii  regions and extract their spectra .",
    "all the spectra , nuclear and extranuclear , show bright pah features and fine structure lines .",
    "the variations of the spectral features from galaxy to galaxy and within a galaxy are relatively small , at least when compared to those observed in ulirgs @xcite or those observed in star - forming galaxies with different metallicities @xcite .",
    "that is , the comparison of the spectra shows that these lirgs have a more or less uniform shallow silicate absorption and relatively high metallicity .",
    "the pah ratios , pah equivalent width and silicate depth measured in the nuclear and integrated low resolution spectra are listed in table [ tbl_lowres_map ] .",
    "table [ tbl_hires_map_integrated ] and table [ tbl_hires_map_nuclear ] show respectively the integrated and nuclear fine structure line fluxes in the high resolution spectra .",
    "amorphous silicate grains present a broad feature centered at 9.7  that can be measured from the sl cubes .",
    "we used a method similar to that proposed by @xcite to measure the observed silicate strength .",
    "first , we extracted 1-d spectra from the cube as described in section [ ss : spectral_maps ] . for each spectrum , we estimated the continuum expected at 10  by fitting a power law through the feature - free continuum pivots at 5.5  and 13 .",
    "then we compared the estimated continuum and the measured flux using the following expression : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the silicate strength . when the silicate strength is negative , the silicate feature is in absorption , whereas a positive silicate strength indicates that the feature is seen in emission .",
    "we estimated the flux at 10  instead of 9.7  ( the maximum of the feature ) to avoid a possible contamination by the molecular hydrogen emission line at 9.67 .",
    "there are several factors that affect the accuracy of the silicate strength measurement .",
    "the most important source of uncertainty is the continuum estimate , because of the presence of broad pah bands in the spectra .",
    "we selected continuum pivots similar to those used by @xcite , so that we can make meaningful comparisons with their results .",
    "the @xmath25 is equivalent to the optical depth of the silicate absorption ( @xmath26 ) defined in @xcite . alternatively , a more accurate way to measure the silicate optical depth is to fit all the features ( pahs , emission lines and dust continuum ) present in the spectrum as pahfit does @xcite .",
    "however , to avoid ambiguities between the pah strength and the silicate absorption , the entire low resolution spectral range ( 5.2  -38 ) is desirable . at longer wavelengths ( @xmath2714.5 ) the pixel size is about 2.5 times larger than at shorter wavelengths and since we are interested in the spatial distribution of the silicate feature we decided to use the first method to estimate the continuum .",
    "to compared these methods , first we fitted the integrated spectra using pahfit , assuming a foreground screen dust geometry to obtain the @xmath28 , and then we compared this value with the measured @xmath25 .",
    "we found that both quantities are well correlated .    keeping in mind that the main source of uncertainty of the silicate strength measurements is the continuum determination",
    ", we estimated that the typical values of the statistical uncertainty are @xmath30.05 for the nuclei and less than @xmath30.15 for the extranuclear regions .",
    "the maps of the silicate feature strength are presented in figure [ fig_map_sil ] .",
    "the sh spectra were also used for rough determination of velocities .",
    "figure [ fig_velocity_field ] shows an example of line fitting for selected regions of ic  5179 to illustrate the detection of variations in the line position , even with the relatively low spectral resolution of the sh module .    since the spectral resolution , r@xmath3600 , is lower than that of most kinematic studies , we tested the validity of the velocities with synthetic spectra .",
    "we created these spectra to simulate an unresolved spectral line as seen by the sh module and then we tried to recover the original line parameters .",
    "the equivalent width of the simulated lines was similar to the observed ones .",
    "we added noise to the spectra to match the continuum signal - to - noise ratio of the maps .",
    "the continuum signal - to - noise ratio , for most of the galaxies , is in the range @xmath360 - 100 at the nuclei and @xmath33 - 10 at the external regions . to allow for the effect of the telescope pointing uncertainties , we distorted the wavelength scale by @xmath35% ( estimated from the pointing information in the bcd file headers ) .",
    "we found that this effect limits the accuracy of the velocity determination to @xmath29 10 km s@xmath13 , independent of the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra . for extended sources , which fill uniformly the slit , the wavelengths are more stable , and then the uncertainty due to the pointing inaccuracy would be lower .",
    "the galaxies studied here are not point sources , neither uniformly extended sources , thus this uncertainty estimation is an upper limit . including the uncertainty in the absolute wavelength calibration ( equivalent to 10% of a pixel )",
    ", we found the minimum uncertainty to be @xmath29 20 km s@xmath13 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the uncertainty in the velocity field is in the range of 10 - 30 km s@xmath13 , depending on the pointing accuracy achieved and the signal - to - noise ratio of an individual spectrum .",
    "thus , we consider that variations in the velocity maps larger than @xmath320 km s@xmath13 are likely to be real .",
    "figure [ fig_v ] shows the velocity fields derived for the  and emission lines ; they range up to a total gradient of @xmath3200 km s@xmath13 and hence include a substantial amount of information about the sources .",
    "lirgs are known to contain highly obscured regions ( a@xmath30mag , see e.g. , @xcite ) , usually coincident with the nuclei of the galaxies . assuming an extinction law and a dust distribution geometry the silicate strength can be converted into a visual extinction .",
    "the maps of the silicate feature of our sample are shown in figure [ fig_map_sil ] . in a large fraction of the systems ( 80% )",
    "the most obscured regions appear to be coincident with the nuclei .",
    "in other cases , the nuclear regions appear to be slightly less obscured than the surrounding regions ( e.g. , ngc  7130 ) or they show a complicated morphology ( e.g. , iras  17138@xmath311017 , ngc  7771 , ic  4687 ) .",
    "we note that the spectra used for measuring the strength of the silicate feature are averaged over @xmath31 kpc scales , and thus some of the real variations seen on smaller scales using ground - based mid - ir observations are smoothed out ( e.g. , the highly obscured southern nucleus of ngc  3256 , see @xcite )",

    "the strengths of the majority of the lirgs are moderate ( @xmath34 ) , and intermediate between those observed in starburst galaxies ( @xcite ) and ulirgs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if we assume a foreground screen of dust , the silicate absorption strength can be expressed in terms of the optical extinction ( a@xmath35 ) using the conversion factor a@xmath36 @xcite .",
    "we then find that the median a@xmath35 of the spatially resolved measurements is @xmath310 mag .",
    "the most extincted region in our sample of lirgs is the nuclear region of ic  694 , also known as arp  299-a ( see also @xcite ) , with a@xmath3737 mag .",
    "the foreground screen assumption gives the minimum extinction compatible with the measurements .",
    "most of the spatially resolved measurements ( 68% ) are in the range of -0.4 to -0.9 .",
    "this range is much narrower than that observed in the nuclear regions of ulirgs ( @xmath38 ) @xcite .",
    "the similarity of the silicate absorption strengths among our sample members suggests that they may be in part a product of radiative transfer in dusty regions .",
    "we can approximate this possibility by assuming that the dust and emission sources are mixed .",
    "the resulting median a@xmath35 is then @xmath320 magnitudes , about 2 times greater than for the foreground screen geometry .",
    "the nuclear and integrated values of the silicate strength are listed in table [ tbl_lowres_map ] .",
    "for all the galaxies , we find that the integrated strength of the silicate feature is smaller than , although comparable to , the nuclear one . the nuclear silicate strengths range from -0.4 to -1.9 , although most of them are larger than -1.0 .",

    "ngc  6701 and ngc  7591 are classified as composite objects which is likely to be a combination of an agn and star - formation activity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "both nuclei appear quite close to region 1b .",
    "the two most obscured nuclei in the sample , arp  299-a and the southern nucleus of ngc  3256 , and their neighboring regions , are in the upper part of the diagonal branch populated by ulirgs , although they do not reach the silicate strengths of the deeply embedded ulirg nuclei .",
    "the comparison between the nuclear and integrated values ( right panel of figure [ fig_pahew_ssi ] ) shows that the integrated spectra tend to have lower silicate strengths and larger  ews .",
    "we find that on average the integrated  ew is @xmath330% larger than the nuclear values , whereas the integrated silicate strength is @xmath315% lower than that found in the nuclei .",
    "that is , the integrated values move the galaxies to the pure starburst class region ( 1c ) in this diagram . in the case of all the active galaxies of the sample , the nucleus is not sufficiently bright as to dominate the integrated mid - infrared spectrum and the dominant contribution from star formation , which is extended over several kpc ( see @xcite ) makes the integrated spectrum look more starburst - like .",
    "although the limited spatial resolution ( @xmath40 ) of the sh maps does not allow us to study the galaxy morphologies in great detail , it is possible to analyze general trends .",
    "the exact spatial distribution of the emission lines depends on the physical conditions and the age of the dominating stellar population in each region . in appendix [ apxdescription ]",
    "we discuss the galaxies individually .",
    "figure [ fig_map_sh ] shows the sh spectral maps of the most prominent features , as well as those of the @xmath41 continuum . the ,  and  fine structure lines have an overall morphology similar to that of the 15  continuum .",
    "we detect  emission in only five systems . in two of them",
    "( ngc  7130 and ngc  5135 ) , the  emission mainly comes from the active nuclei @xcite .",
    "our data do not allow us to determine whether there is a low surface brightness  emission , associated with hii  regions , in these two galaxies due to the relatively low flux of this line . in the other three cases ,",
    "ngc  3256 , ic  4687 , and arp  299 ( for the last galaxy , see @xcite ) , the emission is more extended and we attribute it to the hii  regions seen in the pa@xmath4 and/or h@xmath4 images .",
    "we find that the neon emission (  and ) and the 15  continuum are spatially resolved .",
    "we calculated the ratio between the nuclear ( circular aperture of radius 2 kpc ; depending on the distance the aperture radius varies between 1.5 and 3 pixels ) and the integrated neon line emission and 15  continuum emission for our galaxies , we also used the uncertainty maps to estimate the statistical uncertainty of these ratios ( table [ tbl_extended_ratio ] ) . on average the uncertainty of the ratio is @xmath36% . these are upper limits to the relative contribution of the nucleus to the total emission of the galaxy as in some cases the irs maps do not cover the full extent of the galaxy .",
    "in general the emission arising from the central 2 kpc accounts for less than 50% of the total emission for the neon lines and the continuum , indicating that the star formation is extended over several kpc .",

    "a similar figure was presented by @xcite for the nuclear regions of starburst galaxies .",
    "they found that the extinction can change the relative strength of the pahs by up to a factor of 2 .",
    "we find , however , that the median value of the /  ratio is approximately constant for silicate strengths weaker than @xmath61 , and only deeper silicate absorptions seem to affect the /  ratio .",
    "some caution is needed here because there are very few regions in our sample with silicate strengths stronger than @xmath62 .    as an alternative approach , we corrected these pah ratios for extinction using the spatially resolved measurements of the @xmath25 .",
    "we assumed a foreground screen dust geometry and the extinction law of @xcite .",

    "thus , we conclude that the observed variations in the pah ratios are real , and do not significantly depend on the extinction , at least for regions in our sample of lirgs with relatively shallow silicate absorptions ( @xmath66 .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig_pahratio_ssi ] compares the /  ratio vs @xmath25 values of the nuclear spectra and the integrated spectra .",
    "the general trend is that the integrated spectra have shallower silicate absorptions ( @xmath64 lower @xmath25 , on average ) and slightly larger ( @xmath67 , on average ) /  ratios .",

    "the distribution of the values of the ratio is approximately uniform .",
    "however it is interesting to note two clearly different behaviors .",
    "the majority of the galaxies show a small variation of the /  ratio and a somewhat larger /  ratio in the integrated spectrum .",
    "this behavior is expected , since the  and  are related to ionized pahs and the  to neutral pahs .",
    "the ionized pahs emission is concentrated in the nuclear regions , but the there is a substantial amount of the  emission arising from diffuse regions throughout the galaxies ( see section [ ss : pah_morphology ] ) .",
    "this explains the larger integrated /  ratios of all the lirgs ( see table [ tbl_lowres_map ] ) .",
    "some galaxies , however , show a completely different behavior , with an almost constant /  ratio but a lower /ratio in the integrated spectrum .",
    "the most extreme cases of this behavior are ngc  7130 and ngc  7591 .",
    "@xcite showed that the /  ratio is very sensitive to the size distribution of the pahs , with smaller pah molecules producing lower /  ratios .",
    "one possibility is that smaller pah molecules are destroyed in harsher environments , such as those of seyfert and liner nuclei .",
    "the destruction of small pahs might suppress the nuclear  emission .",
    "this may lead to the different behavior observed in the agn / liner nuclei in figure [ fig_pahratios ] .",
    "moreover , the absolute value of the ratio seems to give little information about the nature , starburst or agn , of the nuclei and we can only distinguish them by the relative variation between nuclear and integrated ratios .    .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]      since the /  ratio is a proxy for the hardness of the radiation field , we can compare the spatial variations of this ratio with those of the /  to ascertain if the radiation field has an effect on the pah ratios .",
    "a comparison between figures [ fig_pah11pah6_sl ] and [ fig_co_sh ] indicates that the /  ratio does not decrease necessarily in regions of enhanced /  ratios .    on the other hand",
    ", the morphology of the /  ratio ( figure [ fig_pah11pah7_sl ] ) resembles that of the /  ratio .",
    "however this resemblance is the opposite of what one would expect .",
    "both ratios present their minima in the nuclear regions for most of the galaxies .",
    "thus while the observed nuclear /  ratio would indicate lower radiation hardness in the nuclei , the pah ratio would suggest a larger ionization state .",
    "again , it is likely that the typical radiation field hardness observed in our sample of lirgs is not sufficiently large as to affect the pah emission , as is the case of the low metallicity galaxies of @xcite .",
    "another possible interpretation is that the pahs and the neon emission are related to different physical processes that due to our limited spatial resolution we can not separate . as a result",
    ", the bulk of the  emission may be produced in star - forming regions , while the  emission also comes from diffuse regions .",
    "thus , low values of the /  ratio trace hii  regions , and larger values indicate less recent star formation .",
    "the latter interpretation is similar to that of @xcite .",
    "they find that the lowest values of the /  ratio are associated with the brightest pah emission .",
    "however , in their galaxies , the /  ratio follows the same trend , whereas this is not the case for the lirgs studied here .",
    "alternatively , as discussed in the previous section , the size of the grains may affect this ratio . if the smaller grains are favored in and around the nucleus , the  emission would be increased respect the  emission . as consequence",
    "the /  ratio would be lower in the nucleus .",
    "@xcite studied the dependency of the ew of the pahs with the radiation hardness for a sample of high metallicity starburst galaxies .",
    "@xcite carried out a similar study , but for low metallicity galaxies .",
    "whereas @xcite found that this dependency does not exist , @xcite found the opposite , that is , the harsher radiation of low metallicity galaxies field lowers the pah ew .",
    "eventually @xcite showed that the reason for the discrepancy is the different range of the radiation field hardness in high and low metallicity galaxies .",
    "in particular , @xcite found that for ionizations above a certain threshold there is a correlation between the radiation hardness and the pah ew , but for lower ionizations this dependency disappears .",
    "we show in figure [ fig_pah113ew_ne3ne2 ] the ew of the  and the /  ratio of those galaxies not classified as agn .",
    "the ionization and metallicity of our lirgs are similar to those galaxies studied by @xcite and , similarly to their findings , there is no correlation between these parameters in our sample of lirgs .",
    "since the  emission traces young stellar populations ( @xmath010 myr ) , and since the  feature can also be excited by older populations ( see @xcite and section [ ss : pah_morphology ] ) , the /  ratio can give us an indication of age variations throughout the galaxies @xcite .",
    "as can be see from figure [ fig_co_sh ] , the /  ratio ranges from @xmath30.1 to @xmath30.6 for our sample of lirgs . in some lirgs ( e.g. , ngc  6701 , ngc  7130 , ngc  7771 , ic  4687 ) the /  ratio appears enhanced in the high surface brightness hii  regions ( see the hst / nicmos pa@xmath4 images in figure [ fig_map_sh ] ) with respect to regions of more diffuse emission . in other galaxies",
    "the interpretation might not be as straightforward . in some cases",
    "the irs angular resolution is not sufficiently high to isolate the circumnuclear hii  regions ( e.g. , ngc  5135 ) , and the age differences may be smoothed out .",

    "the  morphology appears , generally , different from that of the fine structure lines , which are associated with the ionized gas medium .",
    "there are also differences in the velocity fields that will be discussed in section [ s : velocity_fields ] . using the same procedure",
    "as described in section [ ss : lines_morphology ] we find that the  emission is more extended than the 15  continuum in @xmath360% of the sample . in most of these galaxies",
    "the size of the emitting region is larger than that of the fine structure lines ( see table [ tbl_extended_ratio ] ) .",
    "we extracted the nuclear spectra of all galaxies using a 13.4@xmath2013.4  aperture .",
    "this aperture corresponds to physical scales between 3 and 5 kpc depending on the galaxy .",

    "the temperature of the warm molecular hydrogen was calculated as described by @xcite .",
    "we assumed an ortho - to - para ratio @xmath68 @xcite , and thus this assumption may introduce some uncertainty as it is used in the temperature calculations .",
    "the column densities and masses are highly dependent on the  lines used in these calculations . it is preferable to use the lines and because they come from the lowest rotational levels of the hydrogen molecule , and therefore they trace the molecular hydrogen gas at the lowest temperatures which dominates determination of the masses @xcite .",
    "however the line is not detected in all galaxies , and to allow meaningful comparisons we estimated the column densities and masses with the and lines .",

    "it should be noted that these masses correspond to a beam size of 13.4@xmath2013.4  which does not include all the molecular hydrogen emission .",
    "then the mass values listed in table [ tbl_molecular_hydrogen_temp ] should be considered as lower limits to the total  mass of the galaxy .",
    "for instance the integrated fluxes of the line ( table [ tbl_hires_map_integrated ] ) are a factor of between two and three larger than those used in the mass calculations ( table [ tbl_molecular_hydrogen_fluxes ] ) . thus assuming that the physical conditions of the  in the outer parts of the galaxy are similar to those in the inner @xmath33 - 5 kpc , the total mass would be at least a factor of @xmath32 - 3 larger than the values listed in table [ tbl_molecular_hydrogen_temp ] .",

    "this ratio varies by a factor of 10 in our sample of lirgs , although , as can be seen in the figure [ fig_h2s1pah11_histogram ] , 68% of the values are in a narrower range , from 0.028 to 0.073 .",
    "figure [ fig_h2s1pah11_maps ] shows the ratio maps of those galaxies with the most noticeable morphological characteristics .",
    "the  feature falls close to the the 9.7  silicate absorption and , although the  is also close to the silicate absorption at 18 , extinction variations could increase artificially the /  ratio .",
    "we used the extinction curve adopted by @xcite to quantify this effect .",
    "if we assume a mixed model for the dust distribution , the ratio can be increased by up to a factor of @xmath31.4 , for the typical silicate absorption observed in our sample of lirgs . which is much lower than the observed variation . choosing a screen geometry , to increase the ratio by a factor of 2 we would need an optical extinction of a@xmath70100 mag , which is much larger than our estimates ( section [ s : silicate ] ) .",
    "therefore , the effect of the extinction is small compared to the observed variations of the /  ratio .    we can try to distinguish among the different excitation mechanisms by comparing the  morphology with that of the  emission ( figure [ fig_map_sh ] ) .",

    "we note , however , that the southern nucleus of this galaxy is very obscured ( see figure  [ fig_map_sil ] , and @xcite ) , and the  map is not corrected for extinction .",
    "this suggests that the warm  in lirgs is produced not only in pdrs , but that the other mechanisms also play a role .",

    "the hypothesis of shock excitation is supported by large velocity dispersions ( see @xcite for ngc  3690/ic  694 and the following section for additional examples ) .",
    "the galaxy ic  5179 is interesting because its velocity field ( see next section ) is highly ordered , so strong shocks are unlikely , and its x - ray luminosity is low .",
    "thus the  emission in this galaxy is likely to be produced in pdrs .",

    "most of the  velocity fields are consistent with a rotating disk , although some of them show more complex morphologies ( ngc  3110 , ngc  3256 , ic  694 , ngc  6701 and ngc  7130 ) .",
    "only two of the galaxies ( ngc  3256 and ic  694 ) with perturbed velocity fields are part of merger systems . ngc  3110 and ngc  7130 are paired with other galaxies .",

    "the molecular hydrogen velocity field does not present the irregular structure of the ionized gas and the neutral gas ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the velocity field resembles that produced by two disks rotating in opposite sense .",

    "we presented the analysis of /irs mapping observations of 15 local lirgs with extended pa@xmath4 emission .",
    "we studied the spatial distribution of the mid - ir spectral features and compared the nuclear and integrated spectra .",
    "we calculated fine structure line and pah ratios which trace the physical conditions in the star - forming regions .",
    "the main results are the following :    * we used the 9.7  silicate feature strength vs.  equivalent width diagram to classify the activity of the lirgs .",
    "there is a good agreement with the optical classification and this diagram .",
    "most of the lirgs populate the pure starburst class and only the nuclei classified as seyfert from optical spectroscopy appear in the diagram in the agn / sb class .",
    "the integrated values show , in general , larger  ew and shallower silicate absorption than the nuclear spectra .",
    "that is , the extended star formation partially masks the nuclear activity , resulting in a starburst - like integrated spectra .",
    "the silicate feature strength , nuclear and integrated , of our sample of local lirgs ( @xmath34 ) is small compared to that found in ulirgs ( @xmath25 up to -4 ) .",
    "* we constructed maps of the spatial distribution of the / , which traces the radiation field hardness , and the /  that varies with the electron density . in general , the minimum of both ratios is located at the nucleus . the nuclear /  ratio is below the expected range derived by star - formation models .",
    "a possible explanation is that due the high densities in the nuclear regions this ratio is suppressed , including the possibilities that the most massive stars are either missing of buried in ultracompact hii  regions .",
    "alternatively the star formation rate may have decreased rapidly in all nuclei over the last 10 - 20 myr .",
    "* we find a positive correlation between the /  and /  ratios for star forming regions in our sample of lirgs and other starburst galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "agns , for a given /  ratio , show a systematically larger /  ratio .",
    "the few starburst galaxies where we detect the  emission line follow the correlation between the /  and /  observed in hii  regions in other galaxies .",
    "we observe larger /  ratios for those galaxies harboring an agn .",
    "* we find that the  emission is more extended than that of the 5.5  continuum .",
    "however , the ratio of the nuclear ( 2 kpc )  emission with respect to the integrated emission is comparable to that of the 5.5  continuum in most cases .",
    "we find no correlation between the /  ratio and the  ew , thus the effect of the radiation field hardness in the pah emission , for the /  ratio range in our sample of lirgs , may not be important .",
    "we propose that the /  ratio depends on the age of the stellar population .",
    "while the  comes from young star - forming regions , the  arises also from diffuse medium , thus the /  is lower in young hii  regions .",
    "we also found that large /  ratios may indicate recent star formation .",
    "* we explored the variation of the pah ratios across the galaxies . in most cases these variations are real , that is , they are not due to extinction ) . in general",
    "the integrated /  ratios are larger than the nuclear values , probably indicating that the integrated emission includes more neutral conditions .",
    "the nuclear and integrated /  ratios are almost constant , except in the nuclei of galaxies classified as agn where this ratio is higher .",
    "since the  emission is more associated to small molecules , the increased /  ratio in agn could be explained if the small pah molecules are more easily destroyed in the harsh environments of active nuclei . * using the at 28.2  and the at 17.0  lines integrated over 13@xmath2013  ( 3 to 5 kpc ) we estimated the mass of the warm ( t@xmath3300 k ) molecular hydrogen .",
    "it ranges from 0.4 to 2.6@xmath2010@xmath71m@xmath19 , and they are similar to those of ulirgs , local starbursts and seyfert galaxies .",
    "however these masses are lower limits since it is only included the  emission from the central few kpc of the galaxies and the total mass of warm molecular hydrogen is likely to be , at least , a factor of 2 larger . *",
    "the similarity between the pahs and molecular hydrogen morphologies suggests that the main excitation mechanism of the latter is the uv radiation too .",
    "however there are some regions with an excess of  emission with respect to the pah emission , thus the other mechanisms should contribute noticeably to the  emission .",
    "some of these regions are associated to interacting systems , where large scale shocks may also play a role in exciting the molecular hydrogen . * despite the modest spectral resolution of the sh module , we show that useful velocity information can be obtained from the sh spectra . for most of the galaxies and on the physical scales probed by the irs spectra ( @xmath3kpc ) the velocity fields are comparable with that produced by a rotating disk . for the galaxies with available h@xmath4 velocity fields , the  velocity fields are in good agreement with those of the h@xmath4 , both in shape and peak - to - peak velocities .",

    "when comparing maps of lines or features , at different wavelengths , the variation of the point spread function(psf ) size can be significant .",
    "the /irs psf is much less studied than that of the other  instruments , although it is possible to generate synthetic irs psf using stinytim program @xcite .",
    "this is useful for staring observations , but the spectral mapping observation mode introduces extra issues , such as the cube assembly from staring observations , wavelength calibration uncertainties , that can not be easily taken into account using the modeled psf . because of that , a better way to characterize the irs psf of the spectral mapping observation mode is to use the mapping observations of calibration stars available in the  archive .",
    "previously , @xcite studied the factor that should be applied to correct for flux losses when the slit is not centered properly on a point source .",
    "we extend this analysis to characterize the variations of the psf .",
    "to do this , we used the same data sets as @xcite , of spectral mapping observations of calibration stars .",
    "these observations were taken with the same instrument configuration used for the galaxies studied in this paper , but with much smaller steps between pointings , i.e. the calibration observations have a better spatial information of the psf .",
    "details of the observations are listed in table [ tbl_log_cal ] .    after obtaining bcd files processed by  pipeline ( version 15.3 for sh and sl modules , and version 17.2 for lh and ll modules )",
    ", we built the spectral cubes with cubism @xcite .",
    "the sky emission was subtracted using dedicated background observations . to take advantage of the better spatial information of the calibration observations",
    ", we set the pixel size in the final cube to be the size of the step in the perpendicular direction ( see table [ tbl_log_cal ] ) .",
    "we did this for all irs modules , however we only present the results for the sh , sl1 and sl2 modules , because the other modules ( lh , ll1 and ll2 ) , are heavily affected by fringing patterns and their psf is not well reproduced by a gaussian .    in order to study the psf core variations we fitted each plane of the cube using a 2-d gaussian .",
    "we allowed different values of the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) for each axis of the gaussian , but the axis orientation is fixed and aligned with the parallel and perpendicular directions . by doing this we obtained the fwhm and centroid of the psf at every wavelength .",
    "these values are represented in figure [ fig_psf_modules ] .",
    "the undulating pattern of the fwhm and the centroid in the modules sl1 and sl2 is originated by several causes : ( 1 ) the spectral axis is not aligned with the detector , thus to extract the spectra is necessary to resample the original image .",
    "this resampling process produces this kind of periodic patterns .",
    "( 2 ) the algorithm used to build the data cubes ( see @xcite for details ) does not try to correct for this effect . in any case , these variations are small : @xmath010 % for the fwhm and @xmath00.2 arcsec for the centroid position .",
    "the psf core is slightly asymmetric for all modules .",
    "the fwhm in the perpendicular direction is larger than the fwhm in parallel direction , which has an almost constant value .",
    "a possible explanation to this is the way cubism builds the cubes .",
    "it assumes that there is no spatial information in the dispersion ( or perpendicular ) direction and the spatial information in that direction comes from different telescope pointings ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "the averaged values of the fwhm of each module are listed in table [ tbl_fwhm_cal ] .",
    "the variation of the centroid position in sl modules is small .",
    "the 1@xmath21 deviation around the average centroid position are 0.07 and 0.02 arcsec for the parallel and perpendicular direction respectively , that is a twentieth of the sl pixel size .",
    "these variations can be attributed to small telescope pointing errors and signal - to - noise limitation .",
    "the position of the centroid in the sh module shows variations that can not be explained just by instrumental pointing error or a limited signal - to - noise .",
    "the 1-@xmath21 deviation in the perpendicular direction is 0.03 arcsec , but in the parallel direction the variation is one order of magnitude larger ( 0.2 arcsec ) and shows a clear wavelength dependency . the most probable cause for this , is an error in the position and/or angle of the extraction aperture .",
    "however this effect ( 0.6 arcsec ) is small when compared with the sh pixel size ( 2.26 arcsec ) .",
    "we studied the variations of the diffraction rings in the sh module .",
    "we fitted the central row of the cube for each wavelength using a gaussian for the psf core and two gaussians for the only diffraction ring detected .",
    "these two gaussians have the same fwhm and they are symmetrically placed around the psf core position . figure [ fig_psf ] shows a fit example .",
    "the results of the fits are summarized in the figure [ fig_psf_ring ] .",
    "the fwhm of the diffraction ring , that does not depend on the wavelength , is 3.6 @xmath29 0.3 arcsec .",
    "instead the position of the ring depends linearly on wavelength .",
    "the relative value of the diffraction ring peak respect to the psf core peak , depends slightly on wavelength . at 10",
    "it is 11%  of the core peak value and at 19  it is 9%  .",
    "when calculating feature ratios , the point spread function variations ( fwhm and centroid ) , could originate artifacts .",
    "for the sl module these variations are less than one tenth of the pixel size and should not affect feature ratios . for the sh module the major source of uncertainty is the centroid position , but the difference is only one fourth of the pixel size . since these variations are very small compared with the pixel size , they do not affect the calculated feature ratios .",
    "diffraction rings can produce artifacts in the feature ratios too .",
    "they cause inaccurate ratio values 3 or 4 pixels away from the center of the point source in the sh module .",
