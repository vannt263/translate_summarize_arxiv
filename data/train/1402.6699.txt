    "a planet may still have a blackbody spectrum if the atmospheric layers probed are isothermal .",
    "indeed , the emission spectra of some planets are reported to be featureless : e.g. , tres-2 @xcite , tres-3 @xcite , wasp-18b @xcite , and wasp-12b @xcite .    in principle",

    "spectral resolution is critical to such retrieval exercises because a high - resolution emission spectrum is more likely to deviate significantly from a blackbody , and renders the retrieval problem well - constrained .",
    "this bodes well for current and future efforts to perform _ bona fide _ emission spectroscopy .",
    "so far , however , the vast majority of exoplanet emission measurements have been broadband eclipse photometry .",
    "a typical retrieval model uses a dozen parameters to describe the atmospheric composition and vertical temperature profile , while a typical hot jupiter has only been observed in 24 thermal broadbands .",
    "even for the few planets with 6 or 7 thermal measurements , the photometric retrieval problem is under - constrained .    a widely noted consequence of the parameter ",
    "data mismatch is that exact atmospheric properties can not be uniquely determined , making color - color and color - magnitude diagrams more realistic approaches to atmospheric classification @xcite .",
    "the less - discussed aspects of under - constrained retrieval are that ( 1 ) there is no way to reject erroneous measurements , and ( 2 ) the estimated uncertainties on eclipse depths directly affect the uncertainties on atmospheric parameters .",
    "this is in stark contrast to over - constrained problems such as fitting an occultation model to time - series data , for which it is customary to perform outlier rejection ( e.g. , @xmath2-clipping ) , and for which the photometric uncertainties are estimated in the process of fitting a model to the data , rather than trusting the output of aperture photometry routines .",
    "nonetheless , many exoplanet discoveries have been based on broadband emission spectra : a temperature inversion in the atmosphere of hd  209458b was inferred from 4 broadband eclipse depths @xcite , disequilibrium chemistry was invoked to explain the 6-band emission spectrum of gj  436b @xcite , and high atmospheric c / o was discovered based on 7 broadband eclipses of wasp-12b @xcite .",
    "these successes have led to classifying planets based on temperature inversions ( using 2 broadbands per planet ; * ? ? ? * ) and c / o ratio ( using @xmath3 bands per planet ; * ? ? ?",
    "temperature inversions and non - solar chemistry have since been disputed for each of the exemplar planets due to the re - reduction of existing data @xcite acquisition of new data at the same wavelength @xcite or acquisition of new data at different wavelengths @xcite .",
    "such challenges are not unique to eclipse _ photometry _ : the featureless day - side emission spectrum of hd  189733b @xcite exhibited an absorption feature at a later epoch @xcite , and line emission from the dayside of hd  189733b @xcite has been disputed by @xcite .    nor are issues of repeatability limited to superior conjunction : the first thermal phase measurements of an exoplanet @xcite were later found to be off by @xmath4 in phase and more than a factor of 2 in amplitude @xcite ; the first half of the thermal phase measurements of @xcite were later found to be corrupted by detector systematics @xcite .",
    "the situation is similar for transit spectroscopy , where initial claims of molecular absorption bands @xcite were disputed on the basis of data reduction , error estimation , and astrophysical variability @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite offers a sobering review of the exoplanet atmospheric characterization field , speculating that many of the extraordinary claims of the past decade may be overturned by better data .    in this article",
    "we attempt to reconcile burrows pessimistic view with the growing body of papers making statements about planetary atmospheres based on a handful of eclipse measurements . instead of focusing on a single planet , we perform a holistic analysis of all transiting planets with multiple eclipse measurements .",
    "we consider only broadband measurements ( for which it is easy to quantify the number of independent observational constraints ) of eclipse depths ( which are unaffected by star spots ) .",
    "our approach is to compare the goodness - of - fit and evidence for three classes of models : blackbodies , self - consistent radiative transfer , and spectral retrieval .",
    "since the disputes over atmospheric properties have often revolved around the reliability of eclipse depths , we empirically estimate the accuracy of broadband eclipse measurements .",
    "notably , the dominant `` signal '' in space - based eclipse photometry is usually the detector sensitivity , which must be modeled using the very same observations of the science target .",
    "future observations of transiting planets with the james webb space telescope are likely to resolve many of the current scientific disputes about the nature of hot jupiter atmospheres . attempts to push the observatory to smaller and cooler planets , however ,",
    "will still rely on self - calibration ; error estimation and repeatability will therefore remain critical issues .",
    "a search on exoplanet.org @xcite combined with a careful literature review yields 44 exoplanets with published photometric eclipse measurements in at least two thermal wavelengths ( @xmath5  @xmath6 m ) , summarized in table  [ thermal_eclipses ] . in most cases ,",
    "only a single occultation has been measured at each wavelength .",
    "bolded numbers signify measurements based on more data : multiple eclipses and/or an eclipse embedded in phase variations .",
    ".planets with at least 2 thermal eclipse measurements [ thermal_eclipses ] [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     comparing the @xmath7 and @xmath8 columns of table  [ reshoots ] suggests that published eclipse uncertainties are too small : the original researchers , subsequent researchers , or both groups under - estimated the uncertainty in their measurement .",
    "since the latter eclipse measurements are based on more data , we assume that they represent an accurate measurement and uncertainty , while the original measurements , based on a simple occultation , had under - estimated error bars .",
    "alternatively , the planets may be exhibiting weather that changes the eclipse depths from one epoch to the next , as predicted by @xcite .",
    "eclipse depth variability at the level of @xmath9 would invalidate spectral retrieval because multi - band broadband emission spectra are constructed over a span of many planetary orbits .",
    "the weather hypothesis is ruled out in a few cases by the repeat observations discussed in  [ best_case ] , however .",
    "we quantify the degree to which eclipse uncertainties have been under - estimated by combining @xmath7 and @xmath8 to obtain an empirical estimate of systematic uncertainty , following  2.1 of @xcite .    in the first case",
    ", we assume there is an additional source of noise that affects single - eclipse measurements . physically , this might correspond to how well one can model the detector given only a few hour observation of the science target .",
    "we estimate the magnitude of this systematic uncertainty by considering the distribution of @xmath10 . in the one case where the epoch - to - epoch discrepancy , @xmath7 , was smaller than the total published uncertainty , we set this quantity to zero .",
    "the symmetric - distribution is decidedly asymmetrical : researchers analyzing single - eclipse measurements have over - estimated the eclipse depth more often than not .",
    "identifying the cause of this bias is beyond the scope of the current manuscript , so we limit ourself to properly estimating the empirical eclipse uncertainty . ]",
    "distribution @xmath11 \\cup [ -\\sqrt{\\delta^2-\\sigma_{\\rm tot}}]$ ] has a standard deviation of @xmath12 .",
    "we adopt @xmath13 for the remainder of this paper ( this is somewhat greater than , but broadly consistent with , the repeatability estimate of @xmath14 based on a pair of 3.6  @xmath6 m transits of hd  189733b ; * ? ? ?",
    "the second approach is to consider the distribution of @xmath15 , which amounts to hypothesizing that single - eclipse uncertainties have been under - estimated by a constant factor .",
    "for example , researchers may under - estimate the degree to which the unknown detector model impacts eclipse depth uncertainty ( numerical experiments have shown that most extant methods underestimate occultation error bars in the presence of correlated noise ; * ? ? ?",
    "the standard deviation of the symmetric distribution @xmath16 \\cup [ -|\\delta|/\\sigma_{\\rm tot}]$ ] is @xmath17 .",
    "we adopt @xmath18 in the remainder of this paper .",
    "to summarize the previous section , _",
    "spitzer _ has proven capable of photometry better than @xmath0 and many existing eclipse measurements are likely accurate at that level : specifically , those based on multiple eclipses or taken as part of longer phase measurements ( the bolded numbers in table  [ thermal_eclipses ] ) .",
    "single - epoch eclipse measurements of the best and brightest targets have _ not _ been repeatable at this level , however .",
    "this is unfortunate because such single - eclipse measurements represent the vast majority of the broadband emission data ( the unbolded numbers in table  [ thermal_eclipses ] ) .    , but we add an empirical systematic error of @xmath19 in quadrature to each simple - eclipse measurement . in this hypothesis , there is a floor to how precise an eclipse measurement can be without acquiring more data , so modern eclipse measurements are no more accurate than earlier attempts .",
    "eclipse uncertainties based on multiple eclipse measurements , or an eclipse embedded in a phase measurement , are kept unchanged.[realistic_error],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure  [ realistic_error ] shows the distribution of blackbody bic vs.  @xmath20 in light of empirical eclipse depth uncertainties .",
    "values based on multiple eclipse measurements , or obtained as part of phase measurements , are taken at face value .",
    "we add a systematic uncertainty of @xmath21 in quadrature to the quoted uncertainties for all single - eclipse measurements . and @xmath22 would be somewhat smaller , but they would have to be applied across the board , leaving our conclusions essentially unchanged . ]",
    "we then re - fit a blackbody and recompute the bic for each planet using these more realistic error bars .    , but we inflate the published single - eclipse uncertainties by the empirical factor @xmath18 .",
    "this scenario accounts for the possibility that modern eclipse measurements , which have much smaller quoted uncertainties than the first generation of eclipses , might really be more accurate than their predecessors .",
    "eclipse uncertainties based on multiple eclipse measurements , or an eclipse embedded in a phase measurement , are kept unchanged.[error_factor],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in figure  [ error_factor ] we inflate the published uncertainties of single - eclipse measurements by our empirically determined factor of @xmath18 .",
    "we then re - fit a blackbody and recompute the bic for each planet using these more realistic error bars .    under the assumption of realistic eclipse uncertainties , hd  189733b",
    "has the most featured emission spectrum and lies in the green region in both figures  [ realistic_error ] and [ error_factor ] .",
    "if spectral retrieval could achieve a perfect fit , @xmath23 , then it would be modestly favored as compared to the blackbody , according to the bic .",
    "obtaining such a good fit is not trivial for this planet because even our realistic noise hypothesis takes the published uncertainties at 3.6 , 4.5 , and 8.0  @xmath6 m at face value .",
    "all other planets lie at / below the dashed green line , suggesting that blackbodies are favored , _ even if spectral retrieval provides a perfect fit to the data_. in any case , a researcher who has gone to the trouble of running a markov chain monte carlo to perform spectral retrieval should also estimate the evidence for their model using the posterior distribution ; bic is merely a way of approximating this .",
    "ideally , the evidence for spectral retrieval models with different numbers of parameters could be compared using , for example , a reversible jump markov chain monte carlo @xcite or nested sampling @xcite .",
    "given the small number statistics , we expect a broad range of @xmath24 values with a significant tail ; the gray zone indicates the @xmath25 ( 68.3% ) interval . nonetheless , a few short period planets lie well above the gray region in figures  [ realistic_error ] and [ error_factor ] , suggesting they are poorly fit by a blackbody and hence exhibit spectral features .",
    "these features are either the hints of molecular bands , or remaining astrophysical / detector noise . the only planets that make the cut under both the @xmath26 and @xmath22 hypotheses are corot-2b , hd  189733b , and wasp-5b . in order to put the poorly - fitting blackbodies in perspective , we compare them to self - consistent radiative transfer models .",
    "self - consistent atmospheric radiative transfer models typically have between one and three tunable parameters : recirculation efficiency , optical opacity , and relative abundance of co ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are usually tuned by eye in order to obtain a decent fit . in",
    "what follows we will quote @xmath27 values from the literature ( i.e. , using published eclipse uncertainties ) .",
    "as such , the values should be compared to the blackbody bic values shown in figure  [ blackbody_bic ] .    as noted by @xcite ,",
    "corot-2b is so poorly fit by spectral models at 4.5  @xmath6 m that a blackbody fit has a smaller @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , @xcite explain the anomalous eclipse depth by invoking emission from a circumstellar accretion disk contaminating the system flux in the mid - infrared at the level of @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite performed spectral retrieval on wasp-5b , but the authors were unable to obtain a good fit that conserved energy , even when they allowed the atmospheric c / o ratio to vary .",
    "it is hard to imagine that a self - consistent radiative transfer model with only two variables would do any better .",
    "the 3.6  @xmath6 m photometry of hd  189733b is @xmath1 discrepant from the best match 1d radiative transfer model obtained by varying two model parameters @xcite .",
    "the mismatch between the predicted and measured flux at 3.6  @xmath6 m contributes @xmath29 to the @xmath27 budget , making this model a far worse fit than a simple blackbody ( @xmath30 , as shown in figure  [ blackbody_bic ] ) .",
    "it is likely that bona fide fits using self - consistent radiative transfer models could provide somewhat better @xmath27 , but this is computationally intensive and has only been performed once , to our knowledge @xcite .",
    "a recent wholesale look at all extant eclipse spectra concluded that the only potentially robust area of agreement between self - consistent models and the data was the `` systematic increase in the ratios to shorter wavelengths '' @xcite .",
    "in other words , the planets poorly fit by blackbodies are also poorly fit by self - consistent radiative transfer models .",
    "the radiative transfer models could simply be wrong .",
    "there have been efforts to compare and validate exoplanet radiative transfer codes @xcite and many have been tested against high quality observations of brown dwarfs , but it is possible that they are missing important physics relevant to irradiated planets .",
    "`` missing physics '' includes atmospheric dynamics and clouds , but these are also omitted from most spectral retrieval models .",
    "we therefore hypothesize that the spectral features in extant broadband spectra are due to a combination of astrophysical + detector noise ; spectral retrieval provides better fits because it is under - constrained .",
    "most recent measurements have not yet been repeated , but one could argue that the various advances in reduction and analysis have made modern eclipse measurements more accurate than their predecessors . in hindsight , it is easy to point out poor judgements made by earlier researchers . in all cases ,",
    "however , the authors were making defensible choices about how to treat the data and how to fit it . in no case",
    "has the original paper been retracted or has an erratum been published . with one exception @xcite , researchers have only questioned the original measurements once better observations were available .",
    "researchers still make choices about their reduction scheme , and the intra - pixel sensitivity variations of _",
    "warm spitzer _ are still modeled using the same few hours of data that are used to measure the eclipse depth .",
    "we should aspire to parametrize these choices and marginalize over them to produce accurate , if less precise , measurements .",
    "a promising avenue is to use gaussian processes to model the intrapixel sensitivity variations , which implicitly marginalizes over the functional form of the detector model .",
    "this strategy has been used for transit spectroscopy @xcite and to model the effect of star spots on thermal phase variations @xcite .    moreover , none of the studies reporting secondary eclipse measurements account for how the meta - parameters of reduction and analysis pipelines contribute to uncertainty in eclipse depth . at best ,",
    "researchers experiment with a variety of schemes and adopt the one that minimizes the scatter in the photometry @xcite .",
    "this amounts to optimizing the meta - parameters rather than marginalizing over them .",
    "if different choices of meta - parameters , detector parametrization , or astrophysical parametrization lead to significantly different eclipse depths ( see  4.2 ) , then one should be wary of small quoted uncertainties .",
    "the possibility of multimodal posterior distributions should also give us pause , since neither gradient descent ( e.g. , levenberg - marquardt ) nor markov chain monte carlo routines are well suited to finding global solutions under these circumstances .    in short , the current generation of single - eclipse measurements are still systematics - dominated and susceptible to many of the same problems as the previous generation . in the @xmath26 hypothesis , there is a noise floor that affects all single - eclipse measurements , so current single - eclipse measurements are little better than the first generation . in the @xmath22 hypothesis , on the other hand ,",
    "the uncertainties are under - estimated by a constant _ factor _ , so single - eclipse measurements published today ( which tend to have small quoted uncertainties ) are taken to be more accurate than their predecessors .",
    "in other words , the @xmath22 hypothesis assumes that eclipse depth estimates are becoming more accurate with time . that @xmath22 can be a function of time , rather than constant ; one could hope that @xmath22 tends to unity , indicating that observers are getting better at estimating the accuracy of their measurements . ]",
    "our results are independent of which hypothesis we choose , as discussed above .",
    "measurement - to - measurement variance in eclipse depths is only sensitive to systematics that change from epoch to epoch : detector behavior , star spots , and exoplanet weather .",
    "there are other systematics , however , that might remain constant from epoch to epoch but that still introduce an error in our estimate of the planetary flux .",
    "wasp-12b is the poster - child for such astrophysical sources of uncertainty , starting with the possibility of contamination from a circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "a change in astrophysical assumptions  namely the strength of ellipsoidal variations  affects the 4.5  @xmath6 m eclipse depth of wasp-12b by @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "moreover , published eclipse measurements of wasp-12b have had to be revised after the discovery of a binary companion that diluted the eclipse measurements , leading to eclipse depth increases of @xmath32 to @xmath33 in the near to mid - infrared @xcite . in short ,",
    "even if the photometry for an exoplanet system were precisely known , there is significant room for error in the dayside emission of the planet , which is the quantity we need to know for spectral fitting .",
    "the retrieval of atmospheric structure and composition from disk - integrated broadband photometry hinges on planets not emitting like blackbodies .",
    "we have considered the 44 short - period planets with emission measurements in multiple broadbands .",
    "if published uncertainties are taken at face value , then seven of these planets have broadband spectra that favor spectral retrieval over blackbody fits , according to the bayesian information criterion ",
    "corot-2b benefits the most from the additional model parameters .    in order to perform under - constrained spectral",
    "retrieval , however , it is critical to know the actual uncertainty on eclipse measurements . _",
    "spitzer _ is capable of exquisite photometry ( @xmath34 ) , but single eclipses acquired , reduced and analyzed in isolation have only been repeatable at the @xmath25 level of @xmath1 ( or single - eclipse uncertainties have been under - estimated by a factor of 3 ) .",
    "if one adopts such empirical uncertainties for single - eclipse measurements , then blackbody fits are preferable over spectral retrieval for all planets , with the possible exception of hd  189733b .    we conclude that statements about atmospheric composition based solely on broadband emission measurements are premature .",
    "if one adopts empirical estimate of single - eclipse accuracy , then hd  209458b and gj  436b are well fit by blackbodies , and wasp-12b is not so poorly fit as to favor spectral retrieval .",
    "this resonates with the cautionary review of @xcite .",
    "temperature inversions and odd compositions were inferred for short period planets based on broadband emission spectra @xcite .",
    "our results call these claims into question . undoubtedly , many planets have stratospheric inversions and non - solar chemistry , but there is no robust evidence for this in the current photometry of short - period planets .",
