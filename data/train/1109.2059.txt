    "these aromatic compounds are now forming a new class in the family of carbon - based superconductors that include graphite - intercalation compounds ( gics ) and doped fullerenes . for gic , kc@xmath13 , the first carbon - based superconductor with @xmath14 k@xcite ,",

    "the electronic structures of pristine and doped picene were first obtained by the present authors@xcite as an initial step to elucidate the mechanism of superconductivity .",
    "it has been revealed that the conduction band group is derived from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) and lumo+1 of a picene molecule .",
    "the conduction - band structure of solid picene , where the molecules are arrayed in a herringbone structure with two molecules per unit cell , is indeed shown to be accurately reproduced by a four - orbital tight - binding model downfolded in terms of the maximally - localized wannier functions  @xcite .",
    "we have also determined the dopant positions for k@xmath5picene , where we have employed the experimental lattice parameters .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , provided two , fully - optimized geometries of k@xmath5picene , one with a herringbone structure and the other with a laminar structure .",
    "giovannetti and capone@xcite performed an electronic structure calculations with different exchange - correlation functionals , and found that a hybrid functional leads to an antiferromagnetic state in k@xmath5picene .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrated that an antiferromagnetic state is stabilized in k@xmath5picene when the volume is increased .",
    "they , as well as giovannetti and capone , suggested that a strong electron correlation exists in the system .",
    "this is reasonable in that the electronic correlation energy in solid picene is estimated to be @xmath24 ev with the momentum - dependent electron - energy - loss spectroscopy,@xcite which is actually greater than the width of the lumo- and lumo+1-derived conduction bands .",
    "this is also the case for potassium - doped picene , as will be demonstrated below .    since the report of the superconductivity in potassium - doped picene",
    ", a few theoretical studies aiming at clarifying its mechanism of superconductivity has been reported .",
    "these include phonon studies such as kato _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who have estimated the phonon frequencies and the electron - phonon coupling for various hydrocarbon molecules . for picene they found that the electron - phonon coupling is large enough to attain @xmath25 k. subedi and boeri@xcite calculated the electron - phonon interactions in doped picene within the rigid - band approximation , and obtained coupling constants large enough to explain the experimental @xmath26 k in k@xmath5picene .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite performed a more elaborate calculation , and obtained the electron - phonon coupling large enough to explain the experimental @xmath27 k , to which they found the dopant and intermolecular phonon modes contribute significantly .",
    "however , one essential question is : what is so special about k@xmath5picene as opposed to other values of @xmath28 ?",
    "the question is important , since it should be intimately related to another question : to what extent the aromatic superconductivity is general .",
    "we can for instance remember that the problem of why @xmath29fullerene ( @xmath30 : alkali metal elements ) is special played an important role in elucidating its electronic properties .",
    "one experimentally unresolved situation is that , in the doped picene , both its atomic structure and even the number of dopant atoms actually accommodated in the samples have yet to be experimentally determined , although there are some estimates as discussed in ref.@xcite . given the circumstance , a theoretical prediction for the geometry of doped picene is thus desirable , especially for systematically varied doping levels .",
    "this will also give a starting point to discuss whether the superconductivity is driven by a phonon mechanism , or by an electronic mechanism as in some classes of organic superconductors@xcite .",
    "this is exactly the purpose of the present work . for organic materials , not only the atomic positions but",
    "also the unit cell should be relaxed for a reliable optimization of the geometry .",
    "hence we have performed here the full structural optimization of k@xmath0picene , covering the concentration range @xmath2-@xmath3 .",
    "for the electronic structure calculation and the structural optimization in the present work , we adopt the density - functional theory with the projector augmented - wave ( paw ) method  @xcite with the quantum materials simulator ( qmas ) package  @xcite in the local density approximation ( lda)@xcite . the bloch pseudofunctions are expanded in plane waves , with an energy cutoff of @xmath31 ry throughout the present work .",
    "all the self - consistent field calculations are performed with @xmath32 @xmath33 points .",
    "the structural optimization allows the atomic coordinates and the cell parameters to be relaxed with no constraint imposed on them . in each iteration of the self - consistent field calculation ,",
    "the forces and stress@xcite felt by the system are calculated .",
    "the optimization is regarded as converged when the largest force and stress are smaller than @xmath34 ht/@xmath35 and @xmath36 ht/@xmath37 , respectively .",
    "we employ the maximally - localized wannier function technique@xcite , which has been recognized to be a standard method for describing electronic orbitals in solid . there ,",
    "wannier functions are constructed from the bloch wave functions belonging to the specified electronic bands . in the present work",
    "we extract the transfer integrals between the localized wannier functions constructed for the solid picene .",

    "this is to be contrasted with rb@xmath0picene , whose @xmath38 axis was observed to expand up to @xmath83 and shrink afterwards .    in fig .",

    "we can see that the wfs have basically the same features for all the structures in that all the wfs have lumo and lumo+1 orbital characters , although small but significant amplitudes found around the potassium atoms whose magnitudes depend on the doping level @xmath28 .",
    "more precisely , we can show that @xmath52 and @xmath53 have characters of the linear combinations of lumo and lumo+1 : @xmath84 , as in the undoped picene@xcite .",
    "however , a key message in the present band structure results is that , although the orbital characters of the wfs are common to all the optimized geometries , their band structures very much differ .",
    "this is not surprising , since the molecular shape as well as the herringbone arrangement of molecules _ distort _ significantly with doping .",
    "more importantly , the lobes of molecular wfs extend outward the molecule via the potassium atoms , with significant _ hybridizations _ of wfs around the potassium atoms . specifically , we find that the small contributions from the potassium wave functions have a @xmath85 orbital character , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_wanniers ] .    in other words ,",
    "the rigid - band picture is invalidated for multifold reasons , i.e. , through the rearrangement and distortion of molecules , but also via hybridization of the potassium @xmath85 orbitals with the molecular orbitals of picene .",
    "indeed , for all the optimized geometries we have also calculated their band structures ( not shown ) with potassium atoms removed but the doping level is fixed by shifting the chemical potential to find that the band structures are drastically changed from those of the doped systems . as a consequence the resultant fermi surface exhibits a variety of multiband structures which take diverse topology for k@xmath4picene and k@xmath5picene .",
    "this obviously provides an intriguing starting point for exploring mechanisms of superconductivity as a future work .",
    "final point of interest , about the molecular species dependence , is the following : we can note that the calculated band structures for all @xmath28 ( including @xmath86@xcite ) have significant dispersion along the @xmath38 direction as well as along the @xmath42 and @xmath87 directions , which indicates isotropic components in the electron transfers .",
