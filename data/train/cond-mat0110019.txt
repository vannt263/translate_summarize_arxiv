    "a variety of experiments@xmath14 points out that the small coherence length , reduced carrier density , high transition temperature @xmath10 and marked anisotropy of cuprate superconductors cause strong enhancement of superconducting fluctuations ( sf ) .",
    "in contrast to conventional superconductors , in cuprates the transition region is considerably smeared by sf which can be detected in a wide temperature range , up to 10 - 15 k. the formation of the fluctuation cooper pairs above @xmath10 results in the appearance of a langevin - type diamagnetic contribution to the magnetization @xmath15 , existing side by side to the paramagnetic contribution from fermionic carriers .",
    "since the size of fluctuating pairs @xmath16 grows when @xmath17 approaches the transition temperature @xmath10 , @xmath18 should diverge near the transition for any small fixed magnetic field , being equal zero for @xmath19 on the other hand it is evident that very strong magnetic fields , comparable to @xmath20 must suppress sf .",
    "therefore the isothermal magnetization curve @xmath21 has to exhibit an upturn .",
    "this upturn can be quantitatively described in the framework of the exactly solvable , for any magnetic field , zero - dimensional model@xmath22 ( superconducting granula with the size @xmath23 @xmath16 ) or by means of cumbersome microscopic treatment accounting for the short - wavelength fluctuation contribution in the @xmath24 case.@xmath25    the experiments on conventional bcs superconductors show that the magnetization is quenched for fields as low as @xmath26 ( see ref.@xmath27 .",
    "the value of the upturn field  @xmath28 in the magnetization curves can be considered inversely proportional to the coherence length.@xmath29 this explains why in optimally doped high - temperature superconductors , the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) picture works pretty well . here",
    "the coherence length is so short that the quenching of fluctuating magnetization on increasing the magnetic field has not  yet been observed .",
    "the fluctuating magnetization of layered  superconductors  in the vicinity of the transition temperature and for h@xmath30 when the contribution of short - wavelength fluctuations@xmath25 is negligible , can be theoretically described@xmath31 in the framework of the gl scheme with the lawrence - doniach hamiltonian.@xmath32 the fluctuating diamagnetism ( fd ) turns out to be a complicated nonlinear function of temperature and magnetic field and can not be factorized on these variables .",
    "an important role in fd is played by the degree of anisotropy of the electronic spectrum .",
    "all these aspect of fd have been found to occur in optimally doped ybco.@xmath33 also scaling arguments@xmath34 were found@xmath35 rather well obeyed in this compound .    in underdoped ybco ,",
    "instead , marked deviations from the behaviour expected in the framework of gl approaches have been detected .",
    "a first qualitative claim in this regard goes back to kanoda et al.,@xmath36 who noticed that in oxygen deficient ybco the fd in small fields was enhanced . later on ,",
    "novel features of fd in underdoped compounds have been reported @xmath37 .",
    "in particular , in underdoped ybco at @xmath38 marked enhancement of the susceptibility for fixed @xmath39 in a field of 0.02 tesla was detected above @xmath40 , with magnetization curves strongly different from the ones in optimally doped ybco.@xmath41  magnetization curves have been subsequently reported @xmath42 in underdoped @xmath43 ( lasco ) . for the moment we only mention that the magnetization curves reported by carballeira et al.@xmath42 in underdoped lasco , although indicating field - affected fluctuation - induced diamagnetism , do not exhibit the upturn with the magnetic field as the ones in underdoped ybco that we will discuss later on",
    ". finally , recent magnetization data@xmath44 as a function of temperature in @xmath45 single crystal ( with transition temperature in zero field @xmath46 ) indicate sf obeying to @xmath47 scaling conditions for @xmath48 tesla and turning to @xmath24 scaling for smaller fields .    qualitative justifications of the anomalous diamagnetism in underdoped ybco have been tried@xmath49 , essentially based on the idea of charge inhomogeneities leading to non - percolating superconducting  drops  or on the extension of the theory by ovchinnikov et al.@xmath50 , where the anomalous diamagnetism is related to regions having local @xmath10 s higher than the resistive transition temperature .",
    "the first theoretical study specifically aimed at the description of fd in underdoped ybco was undertaken by sewer and beck @xmath51 . in the framework of the lawrence - doniach model ,",
    "these authors justify the temperature and field dependences of the magnetic susceptibility by taking into account the phase fluctuations of the order parameter , thus arriving to a layered xy - model for a liquid of vortices .    in this paper",
    "we address the problem of the fluctuating diamagnetism in the y@xmath0ca@xmath1ba@xmath52cu@xmath3o@xmath4 family and of its dependence from the number of holes , by reporting squid magnetization measurements in a series of samples .",
    "preliminary results on overdoped compounds have been presented to a meeting and published elsewhere.@xmath53 since some differences in the magnetic behaviour of chain - ordered and chain - disordered ybco have been noticed@xmath54 , we also attained the underdoped regime by means of @xmath55 for @xmath56 substitution in ideally chain - empty @xmath57 , while for the overdoped regime the same heterovalent substitution was performed in chain - full @xmath58 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect.ii experimental details and the majority of the experimental results",
    "are reported .",
    "the analysis of the data ( sect.iii ) is first tentatively carried out on the basis of an anisotropic free energy gl functional , within the gaussian approximation .",
    "the inapplicability of such an approach for non - optimally doped compounds is stressed .",
    "then the theory for phase fluctuations of the order parameter in layered liquid of vortices is revised , to properly take into account terms neglected in the previous formulation.@xmath51 in particular non - reversibility and relaxation effects of the magnetization are argued to support the picture of non - percolating , locally superconducting droplets above the resistive transition temperature , that we interpret as phase fluctuations of a non - zero order parameter below the local irreversibility temperature",
    ". thus a comprehensive description of fd in the y@xmath0ca@xmath1ba@xmath52cu@xmath3o@xmath4 family is obtained , as it is summarized in sect .",
    "the samples of chemical composition @xmath59 were prepared by solid state reactions of oxides and carbonates in flowing oxygen at 1000 k for about 100 hours .",
    "x - ray diffractometry was used to check the presence of a single phase .",
    "the oxygen stoichiometry was first estimated by thermogravimetry and energy dispersive spectrometry .",
    "the samples were then oxygenated close to @xmath60 by annealing in oxygen atmosphere ( 25 atm ) at@xmath61450 k for about 100 hours or deoxygenated as much as possible close to @xmath62 , for about 100 hours in vacuum .",
    "the final oxygen content turned out @xmath63 for overdoped ybco and @xmath64 for the underdoped samples , estimated with loss of mass measures . before the measurements ,",
    "the samples stay at room temperature for about 1 week .",
    "the resistive transition in samples of the same batch appeared very sharp , with moderate evidence of paraconductivity in a temperature range of 5 - 10 k above the transition .",
    "after mixing the samples with epoxy resin , they were oriented by hardening in a strong magnetic field ( 9 tesla ) .",
    "the orientation was tested by comparing the diamagnetic susceptibility for h//c with the one for h in the ab plane , where practically no enhancement of m@xmath65 was noted to occur . for samples used in previous works @xmath66 ,",
    "the orientation was also tested by means of the @xmath67cu nmr line ( see ref .",
    "magnetization measurements have been carried out in the oriented powders by means of a quantum design mpms - xl7 squid magnetometer .",
    "measurements were performed also in optimally doped ybco in order to prove that the results in oriented powders do not significantly differ from the ones in single crystals .",
    "the data already obtained by other authors@xmath68 were confirmed . in the following section",
    "we will recall a few results of the studies in optimally doped compounds , when it is required for the comparison of our data in strongly underdoped or overdoped ybco : ca .",
    "the transition temperatures @xmath69 have been estimated from the magnetization curves vs. @xmath17 at small fields ( 20 oersted ) , by extrapolating at m=0 the linear behavior of @xmath70 occurring below t@xmath71 , as shown in the insets in fig.1 .",
    "the values of @xmath40 are collected in table i , where the numbers of holes @xmath72 , as evaluated from the expression @xmath73 , giving the parabolic behaviour@xmath74 of the phase diagram @xmath75 , are also reported .",
    "it is noted that because of the enhanced fluctuating diamagnetism some uncertainty in the estimate of t@xmath71(0 ) is present , particularly in strongly underdoped samples .",
    "this uncertainty does not affect the discussion given later on about the anomalous diamagnetism , which is detected in a temperature region well above t@xmath71(0 ) .",
    "magnetization measurements at constant field h have been performed as a function of temperature , with @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 . in general two contributions to the magnetization m were observed : a pauli - like , positive term @xmath79 , almost @xmath17-independent or only slightly increasing with decreasing temperature in the range @xmath80 from 200k down to about 100 k and a negative diamagnetic contribution @xmath81 arising on approaching @xmath10 .",
    "this latter contribution was extracted by subtracting from m the value obtained by extrapolating for @xmath82 the curve @xmath79 vs. @xmath17  in @xmath80 , where @xmath83 is practically zero .",
    "thus the possible slight temperature dependence of @xmath79 around @xmath10 was neglected in comparison to the much stronger diamagnetic term .",
    "typical magnetization curves @xmath84for overdoped and underdoped samples are reported in fig.2 .",
    "the enhancement of fd , in both regimes , is evidenced .    in fig.3 some isothermal magnetization curves @xmath85 vs h , obtained by cooling in zero magnetic field ( zfc ) down to a certain temperature above @xmath40 ,",
    "are shown . in fig 3c also",
    "a few data for field cooled ( fc ) magnetization , to be discussed later on , are reported .",

    "is reduced to the gl one with the effective mass @xmath93 along @xmath94-direction ,  where @xmath95  is the inter - layer spacing . in the gl region the fourth order term in ( 1 ) is omitted and the standard procedure@xmath96 to derive the fluctuation part of the free energy yields    @xmath97    where the @xmath94-axis is along the z direction , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .    by means of numerical derivation of eq.2 with respect to the field",
    "one obtains the fluctuating magnetization @xmath83 vs. @xmath12 .",
    "as shown in the inset of fig.4 , the magnetization curves in optimally doped ybco are satisfactorily fitted by @xmath83 derived in this way and evidence how the @xmath100 scenario of sf is obeyed on approaching @xmath10 , with a crossover from linear to non - linear field dependence occurring a few degrees above the transition .",
    "correspondingly , the scaling arguments for @xmath24 anisotropic systems hold and @xmath101 vs. @xmath17 cross at @xmath102 , as already observed@xmath103 .",
    "in contrast to optimally doped ybco , the magnetization curves for underdoped and overdoped compounds depart in a dramatic way from the ones expected on the basis of eq.2 .",
    "in particular ( see fig.2a-3b-3c ) , even relatively far from @xmath10 , while for small fields ( h@xmath104t_c@xmath105linear in @xmath12 , upon increasing the field the magnetization shows an upturn and then @xmath106 decreases .",
    "let us remind that in the gl weak fluctuation regime the saturation of the magnetization at high field has to be expected@xmath107 , the superconducting coherence being broken for fields larger than @xmath108 .",
    "an estimate of the order of magnitude of the upturn field @xmath28 can be done from the analysis of the @xmath109 case@xmath96 , namely for superconducting granules of radius @xmath110 smaller than the coherence length @xmath16 . in this case",
    "the order parameter is spatially homogeneous and the exact solution of the gl model can be found and yields    @xmath111    it can be noticed that the most sizeable contribution to the magnetization comes from the fluctuations - induced sc droplets of radius of the order of @xmath112 , which imply most efficient screening.@xmath113 by assuming the condition of zero dimension for these droplets , from eq.3 with @xmath114 one derives an upturn field given by @xmath115 . for @xmath116  and @xmath117 in the range @xmath118 , @xmath28 is expected to be in the range of ten tesla .    thus the magnetization curves in fig.s 3 can hardly be ascribed to the breakdown of the gl approach of the type commonly observed in bcs superconductors@xmath22 . in other words",
    ", a description of fd based on the gl functional in principle should be suitable in ybco compounds for fields smaller than several tesla , particularly not too close to t@xmath71 , as in fact it is observed in optimally doped ybco.@xmath119      then one has to look for other explanations .",
    "as already mentioned , a recent theory has been developed by sewer and beck@xmath51 at the aim to justify the unusual magnetization curves detected in underdoped ybco@xmath54 .",
    "the theory assumes a frozen amplitude of the order parameter while phase fluctuations are taken into account . as a consequence",
    "one has to deal both with thermally activated vortex loops and field induced vortex lines .",
    "two major conclusions of general character can be outlined . for small field",
    "the temperature dependence of the susceptibility is controlled by the vortex loops density @xmath121 , for which    @xmath122   \\eqnum{4}\\ ] ]    according to the xy model . for strong fields , instead",
    ", the vortex line elements dominate , the vortex correlations between different layers become relevant and @xmath83 only slightly increases with h and finally it flattens . no upturn field is predicted , at least for @xmath123 .    in fig.5 the data for @xmath124 , defined as @xmath125 ,",
    "are shown to obey rather well to eq.4 , in correspondence to @xmath126 , in agreement with calculations yielding for the activation energy values around 10 @xmath10 ( see ref.@xmath51 and references therein ) .",
    "@xmath127 turns out to depend only little from doping , being slightly field dependent .",
    "it *  * is necessary to *  * mention that the temperature dependence of the susceptibility above @xmath128 differs from that *  * one measured below @xmath10 , as shown in fig.5 .",
    "however the magnetization curves , as the ones reported in figs . 3 and 4 , can not be accounted for by a theory which does not include an upturn with the field .",
    "furthermore similar effects are found also in overdoped samples ( see figs.2a and 3a ) .",
    "thus we are going to consider the second aspect possibly leading to an anomalous diamagnetism , the one related to charge inhomogeneities causing regions where the hole density is different from the average .",
    "evidences of inhomogeneous structure of cuprates have been found by means of neutron and electron diffraction@xmath129 , as related to stripes and lattice effects or to local variation in the oxygen concentration , particularly near grain boundaries .",
    "intrinsic inhomogeneities , with spatially dependent critical temperature have been considered as possible cause of pseudogap phenomena@xmath130 . a theory for high temperature superconductivity and of the pseudogap temperature dependence based on inhomogeneous charge distribution with site - dependent transition temperature has been recently formulated.@xmath131 in particular , ovchinnikov et al.@xmath50 have considered the anomalous diamagnetism above @xmath10 induced by non - uniform distribution of magnetic impurities , depressing @xmath10 but leaving  islands  which become superconductors above the resistive transition temperature .",
    "an anomalous large diamagnetic moment results above @xmath10 and in this way the strong diamagnetic susceptibility observed in overdoped tl - based cuprates@xmath132 could be explained .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that in this description@xmath133 the magnetization is linear in the field , since the condition of small field is implicitly assumed .",
    "direct evidence of inhomogeneous magnetic domains showing diamagnetic activity above t@xmath71 has been obtained by iguchi et al.@xmath134 by scanning squid microscopy in underdoped lasco .",
    "regions of few tens of @xmath135 , precursors of bulk superconductivity have been imaged in this remarkable work.@xmath134    in the light of the experimental findings and of the theoretical supports outlined above we consider now as a source of diamagnetism above @xmath10 the presence of locally superconducting droplets . from the volume susceptibility ,",
    "let us say at @xmath136 ( see fig.1 ) , one deduces that a few percents of the total material being superconductor above the resistive transition , could actually justify the screening effects observed as fd .",
    "a test of this hypothesis is obtained from the search of magnetic - history dependent effects .",
    "it is known , in fact , that in ybco the irreversibility temperature is not far from @xmath10 and therefore if the anomalous fd has to be attributed to locally sc droplets then one should detect differences between zfc and field - cooled ( fc ) magnetization . in fig .",
    "6 magnetization curves after zero field cooling and the correspondent values of @xmath83 obtained at the same temperature after cooling in the presence of a given magnetic field , are compared .",
    "furthermore relaxation effects have been observed . in fig.7",
    "it is shown how the negative magnetization depends on time , displaying a progressive decrease from the zfc value towards the one measured in fc condition .",
    "the time constant for this relaxation process is close to the one measured in the critical state@xmath137 .",
    "it can be remarked than in underdoped chain - disordered ybco ( fig.3c ) no upturn is observed and the zfc and fc magnetization curves almost coincide .",
    "the explanation that will be supported from our theoretical picture is that the magnetization curves without hysteretic effects refer to superconducting droplets which are above the irreversibility temperature .",
    "one could suspect that the occurrence of superconducting droplets results from trivial chemical inhomogeneities of the samples . as described in the section on experimental details many experimental checks allow us to rule out this hypothesis .",
    "furthermore , samples grown with different procedures and already used by other authors , have been studied .",
    "thus it is believed that the inhomogeneity does not mean the presence of macroscopic parts of the samples at different oxygen and/or calcium content , but it is rather intrinsic , as the ones evidenced in the experiments recalled above .",
    "furthermore it should be remarked that the temperature dependence of the susceptibility above the bulk transition temperature is different from the one occurring in the superconducting state ( see fig.5 ) .    in the following we are going to modify the theoretical description of sewer and beck@xmath51 , still keeping their basic idea of phase fluctuations but taking into account the presence of mesoscopic  islands  with non - zero average order parameter amplitude that can be below or above the local irreversibility temperature .",
    "let us start , as in ref.@xmath51 , from eq.1 by evidencing the order parameter phase contribution    @xmath138 = \\frac{1}{s}{\\sum_{l}}\\int d^{2}r\\left\\ {   { \\em j}_{\\shortparallel } \\left ( { \\bf \\nabla } _ { \\shortparallel } \\theta -\\frac{% 2ie}{c\\hbar } { \\bf a}_{\\shortparallel } \\right ) ^{2}+{\\em j}_{{\\em \\perp } % } [ 1-\\cos ( \\theta _ { l+1}-\\theta _ { l})]\\right\\ }   \\eqnum{5}\\ ] ]    where @xmath139 @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the order parameter phase coupling constants on the plane and between planes respectively .    in this way the occurrence of superconducting droplets below the critical temperature is assumed , where the order parameter phase can fluctuate producing thermal excitations ( vortex and antivortex pairs in 2d , vortex loops in anisotropic model ) .",
    "the potential vector @xmath142 in eq.5 describes both the magnetic field applied parallel to the @xmath94 - axis and the one induced by thermal fluctuations .    by following the 2d coulomb gas theory , at each vortex is associated an effective charge @xmath143  and a vortex - antivortex pair has an energy @xmath144 @xmath145 , playing the role of an activation energy and thus yielding eq.4 . in order to refer to the anisotropic 3d model the vortex lines ( or the vertical elements of the vortex loops ) are correlated along the @xmath94 - axis for a length @xmath146 and a correction to @xmath147",

    "it is noted that in the measurements by carballeira et al.@xmath42 in lasco at t@xmath71=27.1 k the magnetization curves show only a weak tendency to saturation while in lasco at t@xmath21218 k ( therefore more underdoped ) scanning squid microscopy by iguchi et al@xmath134 does evidence diamagnetic effects to associate to locally superconducting droplets .",
    "these droplets should imply a contribution to the magnetization curves similar to the one detected by us in ybco compounds . future research work will have to explore these interesting aspects and the differences until now present between lasco and ybco .",
    "by means of squid measurements in @xmath59 family a non conventional fluctuating diamagnetism has been observed in overdoped and in underdoped compounds .",
    "compared to optimally doped ybco , a large enhancement of the diamagnetic susceptibility occurs and no anisotropic gl functional or scaling arguments can justify the isothermal magnetization curves .",
    "the recent theory@xmath51 for phase fluctuations of the order parameter in a layered liquid of vortices has been revised and it appears to justify some aspects of the anomalous fd in non - optimally doped ybco , particularly the  precritical  temperature activated behaviour of the susceptibility in the limit of zero field .",
    "other experimental observations , noticeably the upturn in the field dependence of the isothermal fluctuating magnetization and history - dependent effects , indicate the role of mesoscopic charge inhomogeneities in inducing local , non - percolating , superconducting  droplets  . on the basis of both types of experimental findings",
    "we have extended the theory of phase fluctuations in the presence of non - zero order parameter .",
    "the terms leading to a novel and relevant dependence of the fluctuating magnetization from the magnetic field were included in the scheme .",
    "the field - related corrections are different when the superconducting droplets are below or above the local irreversibility temperature . in this way",
    "most of the experimental findings have been justified .",
