    "radio - frequency ( rf ) spectroscopy is widely applied to many experiments on atoms or molecules , for which an exquisite energy resolution can be achieved .",
    "this is due to the magnetic coupling nature of the rf transition and the associated long coherence time of the systems . in recent experiments on ultracold weakly - bound molecules ,",
    "rf spectroscopy also allows a precise determination of the molecular binding energy @xcite and the pairing gap in a degenerate fermi gas @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the high energy resolution reveals the fermionic nature of the pairing in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) regime .",
    "in this article we investigate theoretically the radio - frequency excitation spectrum of ultracold molecules .",
    "previous experimental work in this regime shows that molecules are dissociated upon receiving the rf photons @xcite .",
    "the associated bound - free excitation lineshape is characteristically broader and highly asymmetric compared to that for atoms . here",
    ", we provide an intuitive picture to model and derive a simple analytic formula for the excitation rates and the lineshapes .",
    "we show that much information regarding cold collision properties can be extracted from the lineshape .",
    "in particular , the spectrum is very sensitive to tuning a feshbach resonance in the final state scattering continuum , where the rf spectra will evolve into two components : a bound - bound transition to the newly formed molecular state and a remaining weaker bound - free transition .",
    "our analytic results provide excellent fits to both the numerical calculations and the experimental measurements from the innsbruck group @xcite .",
    "we argue that radio - frequency spectroscopy on cold molecules has several advantages in probing ultracold collision properties over the conventional collision measurements .",
    "these include a high energy resolution , the flexibility to probe different channels and its insensitivity to the sample density and temperature .    in this paper",
