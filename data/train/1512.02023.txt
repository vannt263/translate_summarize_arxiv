    "light propagation in a scattering medium can often be described as a diffusive process @xcite , where any memory of the initial state is lost almost immediately , and transport is represented by the incoherent sum over many brownian random walks .",
    "however it was early realized that temporal coherence survives multiple elastic scattering , and thus interference is still possible even after passing through a diffusive medium @xcite . as a consequence of interference",
    "the diffusive picture has to be modified , and the light scattered into different channels develop correlations @xcite .",
    "classical correlations between the intensity scattered in one direction and the intensity scattered into another direction were studied since the 60s @xcite and found many applications , especially in imaging , e.g. in dynamic light scattering @xcite , speckle contrast imaging @xcite , stellar speckle interferometry @xcite , wavefront shaping @xcite , and speckle scanning microscopy @xcite .",
    "the study of quantum correlations of multiply scattered light started much later , probably due to the widespread idea that quantum features are frail and thus unlikely to play a significant role in the presence of strong disorder .",
    "nevertheless it was recently shown that not only certain quantum features can survive multiple scattering @xcite , but that quantum correlations can even be spontaneously created in the scattering process @xcite .",
    "the quantum properties of scattered light proved to be so robust that control over the transport of single photons in a disordered medium via wavefront shaping was demonstrated @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the case of a generic gaussian input state and study theoretically the necessary conditions for the output state to present quantum correlations .",
    "in particular we show that , while entanglement requires specific conditions to be produced , quantum discord is always present in the output state when a thermal input state is used but , surprisingly , not when the input mode is in a coherent state .",
    "classical correlations of scattered light are commonly described by a correlation function @xmath0 that measures the correlations between intensity fluctuations of two different modes @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the light intensity and @xmath5 represents either a time or an ensemble average ( if the system is ergodic the two are equivalent ) .",
    "@xmath6 can be used beyond the classical case to study certain classes of quantum correlations by substituting @xmath7 with the mode s number operator @xmath8 @xcite , and since classical light can never lead to @xmath9 , a correlation value below 1 is considered a clear signature of quantumness @xcite .    in order to study the effect of multiple scattering on a gaussian input state we employ the formalism of density operators and covariance matrices @xcite .",
    "the covariance matrix of two output modes is defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the vector of quadrature operators , that satisfies the commutation relation @xmath12 = i   \\ , \\left ( \\omega^{\\oplus n } \\right)_{\\mu,\\nu } $ ] , which imposes constrains on @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a direct sum .",

    "however , it was shown that even using separable ( i.e. non - entangled ) states it is possible to perform certain computational tasks exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm @xcite .",
    "this means that just the fact of the system being quantum may lead to applications impossible for classical systems , irrespectively of separability .",

    "the search for a universal criterion that captures all the nuances of non - classical correlations is an object of ongoing intensive discussion @xcite .",
    "the presented results contribute to this debate by providing an illustration of the differences between various measures of quantum correlations , such as the correlation function based on intensity fluctuations @xmath6 , entanglement and discord .",
    "we calculated the covariance matrix of two arbitrary output modes of the light elastically scattered by a disordered material for different states of the input mode , and analysed their correlation properties .",
    "surprisingly , the results show that if the input is a thermal state then any two output modes will be ( gaussian ) discorded , a signature of the quantum character of light .",
    "moreover , it turns out that coherent states are the _ only _ gaussian input that do not produce quantum correlations , as measured by any of the quantities considered here .",
    "it is known that the propagation of light through a scattering medium is modified by quantum interference when the input state is entangled @xcite , but the effects of quantum discord on light propagation are still a largely unexplored subject .",
    "quantum discord appears naturally from the multiple scattering of thermal light , even for large photon numbers .",
    "such macroscopic effects can potentially be exploited to develop novel imaging techniques .",
    "since the amount of expected quantum discord grows when the number of scattering channels is small , these effects will play a role especially in the case of strongly scattering materials , where the dimensionless conductance @xmath120 is small  @xcite .",
    "in particular we expect it to have an effect for systems that show anderson localization .",
    "finally , when light undergoes multiple scattering , even very weak nonlinearities can have a dramatic effect  @xcite .",
    "thus diffusion through a nonlinear system will produce a very rich landscape of possible output states , opening the possibility to generate multimode entanglement from classical input light .",
