    "detailed properties of hot winds in massive o- and very early b - type stars so far have been predominantly studied in spectra at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths , because here thousands of spectral lines provide a wealth of parameters , which are needed to test models describing the origin and propagation of the winds .",
    "high resolution uv spectra of massive o - stars show the presence of strong resonance lines that exibit p - cygni profiles as well as an abundance of weaker absorption lines ( see kudritzki 1992 ) .",
    "they are sensitive indicators of mass loss rates as small as @xmath1 to @xmath2 yr@xmath3 , where radio and infrared observations are insensitive .",
    "these developments now enable theorists to apply hydrodynamic stationary ( kudritzki 1984 , pauldrach 1987 and refs . therein ) as well as non - stationary ( nlte ) radiation driven wind models ( pauldrach et al .",
    "1994 , lamers et al .",
    "1999 ) to these uv spectra .",
    "in contrast to the development in the uv domain , interpretations of x - ray spectra from stellar winds remained quite modest since their first observations with _",
    "( seward et al . 1979 ) .",
    "the main reason is that the theory of line radiation - driven stellar winds explains the mass loss from a hot luminous star in the uv ( pauldrach et al .",
    "1994 , lamers et al . 1999 ) , but does nt predict observed x - ray fluxes .",
    "to date no definitive model for the production of x - rays in stellar winds exists , although models involving shocks forming from instabilities within a radiatively driven wind ( lucy @xmath4 white 1980 , owocki , castor , @xmath4 rybicki 1988 , macfarlane @xmath4 cassinelli 1989 , feldmeier et al .",
    "1995 ) seemed most successful so far reproducing the observed x - ray spectra of kt @xmath5 0.5 kev temperature .",
    "the biggest obstacle in analyzing x - ray spectra was the modest spectral resolution of detection devices used in previous x - ray missions , which did not to resolve emission and absorption lines . in that respect the main results from _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ were based on global properties from a large sample of o- and b - type stars ( chlebowsky et al .",
    "1989 , berghfer et al .",
    "1996 ) . among these results",
    "were that the x - ray luminosity scales with the bolometric luminosity with a typical median ratio of log ( l@xmath6/l@xmath7 ) @xmath5 -6 to -7 .",
    "_ rosat _ with its mediocre energy resolution but enhanced soft sensitivity was probably the first good instrument to investigate soft x - ray spectra in the 10 to 80     region close to the far uv domain . in a first major step forward , hillier et al .",
    "( 1993 ) fitted well exposed spectra of @xmath8 pup with detailed nlte models under the assumption that the x - rays arise from shocks distributed throughout the wind and allowing for recombination in the outer regions of the stellar wind .",
    "the best fits predicted two temperatures of log t(k ) of 6.2 to 6.7 with shock velocities around 500 km s@xmath3 .",
    "based on this approach feldmeier et al .",
    "( 1997 ) assumed that the x - rays originate from adiabatively expanding cooling zones behind shock fronts , which are decribed by a post shock temperature and a volume filling factor .",
    "these results were also compared to results from cohen et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who used _ rosat _ and _ euve _ data to constrain high - temperature emission models in the analysis of the b - giant @xmath9cma . here",
    "it turned out that a continuous temperature distribution is needed rather than a single or even two temperature models .",
    "clearly the result of that comparison remained inconclusive , since both views appear rather plausible but indistinguishable in the spectra .    besides the need for more than one temperature models , _ rosat _ spectra offered a limited bandpass only and most of the wind spectra",
    "were found to peak around 0.8 kev . here",
    "ccd spectrometers , like the ones onboard _ asca _ and _ chandra _ , provide a medium energy resolution throughout a band pass of 0.1 to 10.0 kev .",
    "several observations of massive early type stars , i.e. @xmath10 sco ( cohen et al . 1997 ) or @xmath9 car ( tsuboi et al . 1997 ) , indicated that there is a hard component to some of these spectra of 2 kev and higher .",
    "although these two examples may resemble quite extreme cases of massive stars , observations of the @xmath11 ophiuchi cloud ( kamata et al .",
    "1997 ) , ic 348 ( nagase et al . 1999 ) , and the orion trapezium ( yamauchi et al . 1996 , schulz et al . 2001 ) indicated the existence of a similar hard component in the spectra .",
    "the orion trapezium stars in this respect spark special interest , because here it was shown in an ensemble of massive early type stars , that some of their spectra indeed require a hard spectral component of up to kt = 6 kev , some do not ( schulz et al .",
    "with the launches of _ chandra _ ( high energy transmission grating spectrometer hetgs , canizares et al . , in preparation ) and _ xmm _ ( reflection grating spectrometer rgs , den herder et al . 2001 ) in 1999",
    "we now have high resolution x - ray grating spectrometers at hand that allow us to finally resolve the line emission in x - ray spectra of early type stars .",
    "the two first spectra published already showed an obvious discrepancy in x - ray properties . while the hetgs spectrum of @xmath0ori c ( o7 v pne ) showed line emission up to 1.7  (@xmath5 7 kev ) and relatively narrow , symmetric , and unshifted lines ( schulz et al .",
    "2000 ) , the rgs spectrum of @xmath8 pup ( o 4 if ) indicated relatively broad , asymmetric , and blue - shifted lines at moderate temperatures ( kahn et al . 2001 ) .",
    "so far none of the spectra observed so far , with the exception of @xmath8 pup ( kahn et al .",
    "2001 , cassinelli et al .",
    "2001 ) , exhibit dominating x - ray properties as expected from instability - driven shocks distributed throughout the wind ( waldron and cassinelli 2001 , schulz et al .",
    "2000 , gagne et al .",
    "in @xmath8 ori waldron and cassinelli ( 2001 ) interprete the lack of a substantial amount of flux in the forbidden lines of the he - like triplets as an indication that the x - ray emitting zones around @xmath8 ori may lie less than 1 r@xmath12 from the photosphere , since the large uv radiation field here would destroy the @xmath13 transition ( kahn et al .",
    "in fact such an effect is seen in all spectra observed so far and reflects the need to account for uv photo - excitation in these sources . in this respect , the interpretation of the f / i ratio ( f = forbidden line flux , i = intercombination line flux ) in the he - like triplets in ob stars is much more complex and requires assumptions about other properties of the x - ray emission regions .",
    "gagne et al . ( 2001 ) suggested that in less luminous ob stars the line profiles are symmetric and narrower and resemble emission from magnetically confined wind shocks .",
    "clearly , before can attempt to classify ob stars based on their x - ray line properties , we need more high resolution observations .",
    "the orion trapezium has an age of @xmath5 0.3 myr ( hillenbrandt 1997 ) and its early type members represent a canonical sample to study the x - ray properties of very young massive stars . in this article",
    "we compare the properties of trapezium members @xmath0ori a and e with the ones from the brightest member @xmath0ori c.",
    "schulz et al . ( 2000 ) already deduced some remarkable properties from the first x - ray spectrum .",
    "depite the fact that the lines appear symmetric and show no significant blue - shift , line flux ratios from he - like and li - like iron indicate temperatures of @xmath5 60 million k and a study of h- and he - like lines ratios from lower z ions indicate that we see a whole range of temperatures down to 5 million k. the line widths appear relatively narrow with doppler velocities between 200 and 800 km s@xmath3 . in figure 1 ( top )",
    "we show an hetgs spectrum of @xmath0ori c , which was compiled from all the data presented in schulz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) plus all the data from an observation taken three weeks later .",
    "the total exposure time is 85 ks .",
    "the spectrum is corrected for interstellar absorption , where we assumed the column density derived by schulz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for the orion trapezium stars . for the spectral modelling we apply a collisionally ionized plasma as calculated by the astrophysical plasma emission code ( apec , smith et al .",
    "2001 ) , which is implemented in the interactive spectral interpretation software ( isis , houck & denicola 2000 ) . to account for the wide temperature range we apply several temperature components , thermal line profiles , and doppler broadenings between 200 and 800 km / s .",
    "a preliminary fit of such a model to the spectrum is shown in the bottom part of figure 1 .",
    "it includes five temperatures between 6@xmath14 k and 6@xmath15 k with dominating contributions from two temperature components above @xmath16 k. although not all details are worked out yet , the model provides already a very good representation of the spectrum .",
    "the model also does not require significant deviations from a solar abundance distribution and we identify all major fe lines expected for fe xvii to fe xxiv .",
    "@xmath0ori a and @xmath0ori e are the second and third brightest x - ray sources in the orion trapezium .",
    "although assumed to be of very early type as well , the optical properties of @xmath0ori a and @xmath0ori e are not very well documented ( see schulz et al .",
    "2001 and refs . therein ) .",
    "although they appear only four ( @xmath0ori e ) and eight ( @xmath0ori a ) times less luminous in x - rays compared to @xmath0ori c , which is still in the range expected for late o- and early b - type stars ( berghfer et al . 1996 ) , their optical fluxes relative to @xmath0ori c are much smaller than these factors indicate ( petr et al . 1998 ) . in the case of @xmath0ori e this is most extreme indicating that log ( l@xmath6/l@xmath7 ) is well above -6 , which is untypical for o - type stars .",
    "we applied the multi - temperature model as applied to @xmath0ori c to similar hetgs spectra @xmath0ori a and @xmath0ori e. in both cases the spectra appear quite similar and require only three temperature components between 5@xmath17 k and 3@xmath15 k , which may be a consequence of the much lower statistics in these spectra .",
    "again , the dominating contributions to the spectrum are in the temperature components well above @xmath16 k. such high temperatures are consistent with spectral fits obtained form the zeroth order ccd spectra ( schulz et al .",
    "@xmath0ori e shows doppler velocities in the lines of @xmath18 km / s ( ne x ) significantly higher line broading from the one observed in @xmath0ori c. the lines in @xmath0ori a however are clearly broader with velocities of 900 km / s at ne x.    most remarkable so far is the fact , that in both cases the models do not fit the spectra well unless significant departures from the solar abundance distribution are introduced .",
    "figure 2 shows preliminary model fits for @xmath0ori a ( top ) and @xmath0ori e ( bottom ) . for clarity",
    "we only show the model and some of the brighter lines .",
    "a full assessment of these spectra will be given in schulz et al .",
    "2002 , in prep . ) . in both cases",
    "the spectra are dominated by strong ne and and o lines , whereas ionization states of mg , si , s , and fe appear relatively weak .",
    "the high temperatures of the dominating components are also determined by the underlying continuum , especially by the shape at short wavelengths . given the similarity of the temperatures to @xmath0ori c we would not expect large deviations in the line emissivity from what is observed in figure 1 .",
    "for such high temperatures one would expect much higher emissivities at fe xxiii and fe xxiv ( between 10 and 12   ) and fe xxv ( 1.85   ) . from the fit",
    "we determine an abundance for fe relative to solar of 0.2 .",
    "although also slightly underabundant relative to solar , ne appears overabundant relative to almost all the other elements , except ni .",
    "the ni xix and ni xxiv lines observed in @xmath0ori a required an overabundance by about a factor 3 .",
    "given the assumption that the ob stars in the orion trapezium form a canonical sample with respect to age , spectral type , and chemisty , we find remarkable differences in their x - ray spectra .",
    "in fact , the only similarities we find so far are multiple high temperature components and relatively narrow , symmetric , and unshifted lines . the temperatures in @xmath0ori a and @xmath0ori e are not quite as hot as in @xmath0ori c , but still high enough to question the validity of instability - driven wind shock models .",
    "the fits do include temperature components with temperatures low enough to be consistent with these models , however the contribution to the total spectrum is less than 20@xmath19 . because of the high temperatures schulz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggested the inclusion of magnetic field effects as well as stellar rotation into the models for very young stars .",
    "similarily , gagne et al .",
    "( 2001 ) recently compared x - ray lines @xmath0ori c with lines from another young massive star @xmath10 sco ( b0 v , cohen , cassinelli , @xmath4 waldron 1997 ) and also concluded that these properties may be the result interactions with magnetic fields .",
    "most striking are clearly the observed abundance variations in @xmath0ori a and @xmath0ori e. given the fact that @xmath0ori c does not require any awkward abundances and that those stars evolved from a common progenitor cloud , such variations seem quite mysterious .",
    "however , one should be quite careful with the interpretation of these findings , because due to the complexity of the spectra , which are already reflected in the fact that we need multi - temperature components , many other issues can contribute .",
    "one issue is possible contributions from low - mass companions .",
    "we know from recent interferometric measurements that @xmath0ori c ( weigelt et al . 1999 ) and @xmath0ori a ( petr et al . 1998 ) have close low - mass companions .",
    "kastner et al . (",
    "2001 ) very recently reported on an iron deficiency , but neon enhancement in the nearby classical t tauri star tw hya . with a luminosity of @xmath20 erg / s , however , a possible contribution of a t tauri to these spectra",
    "can not exceed 10@xmath19 .",
    "so far @xmath0ori e has not shown signatures of a companion .",
    "other issues involve opacity effects - we did not yet introduce intrinsic absorption to each spectral component - and wind interactions .",
    "an effect from the latter may not be unlikely in a close system like the trapezium , which also shows evidence for a variety of deeply embedded low - mass objects .",
