    "linearly accelerated observers should detect a thermal background with black - body spectrum in place where an inertial observer detects no particles .",
    "this result is known as the fulling - davies - unruh effect @xcite .",
    "several analysis of non - inertial observers have been done through a quantized field theory construction in the coordinates adapted to an accelerated observer  rindler coordinates .",
    "now while analyzing the closely related hawking effect @xcite for black - holes , an easier and more conceptually transparent single - particle analysis , the _ tunneling mechanism _ , was developed @xcite .",
    "this considers a virtual pair of particles formed just inside the horizon , one ` ingoing ' towards the black - hole i.e. away from horizon , while the other ` outgoing ' one traveling towards the horizon .",
    "now , as against classical general relativity , this outgoing particle is taken to quantum - mechanically tunnel outside , with a small probability .",
    "the tunneling analysis has also been done in the unruh effect @xcite where the rindler wedges @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ wedgedia ] ) act as black - hole interior and exterior regions , with the accelerated horizon playing the role of the black - hole horizon .",
    "however the tunneling mechanism could only derive the unruh ( or hawking ) temperature and not explicitly the spectrum .",
    "recently this drawback was removed @xcite through a quantum statistical analysis of a system of particles that are tunneling across the horizon , leading to a clear derivation of the hawking black - body spectrum , in case of a spherically symmetric black - hole .",
    "other applications of this method may be found in @xcite where the kerr - newman black hole was considerd , and in @xcite where black hole solutions in lovelock gravity is discussed .    in this paper ,",
    "i calculate the thermal spectrum in unruh effect , within the tunneling formalism .",
    "the methodology follows @xcite , but with a modification in the calculation of tunneling modes . instead of the usually applied wkb approximations ,",
    "i use full solutions of the klein gordon and dirac equations in @xmath2-d rindler spacetime , as the tunneling modes .",
    "this is possible as the flat rindler metric is inherently simpler than , say , the schwarzschild metric where full solution of the klein gordon equation is not known .",
    "thus , this article provides a new and conceptually appealing derivation of the unruh effect .",
    "the path of constant , linear acceleration ( say @xmath3 ) in minkowski spacetime , is described by the hyperbola @xmath4        where @xmath5 & @xmath6 are minkowski coordinates , with @xmath6-axis being the direction of acceleration .",
    "if i consider a range ( @xmath7 ) of accelerated observers , the entire ` wedges ' @xmath1 and @xmath8 can be covered with the resultant hyperbolae .",
    "these wedges are known as ` _ _ rindler wedges _ _ ' .",
    "a new coordinate system  the rindler coordinates  can now be set up taking these timelike hyperbolae and corresponding spacelike lines ( fig .",
    "[ wedgedia ] ) as the coordinate lines .",
    "they are related to the minkowski coordinates , in wedges @xmath1 and @xmath8 ( indicated as subscripts ) , through the following relations : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a constant .",
    "the minkowski line element @xmath12 can now be written as @xmath13    this is a generalized form of the rindler metric and for different choices of the function @xmath14 , we can get all the different forms of rindler metric seen in literature . though this metric covers the entire minkowski plane , the coordinates @xmath15 and @xmath16 change in the different wedges .",
    "the rindler horizon occurs at @xmath17 .",
    "the two wedges @xmath1 and @xmath0 on two sides , act like the black - hole exterior and interior regions respectively , as seen in the case of schwarzschild solution .    changing to a tortoise",
    "coordinate @xmath18 appropriate for the rindler metric ( [ genrind ] ) through @xmath19 the metric ( [ genrind ] ) becomes @xmath20 returning to equation ( [ hyperbola ] ) , though the hyperbola describes a real accelerating particle only in wedge @xmath1 , the hyperbolae can be analytically extended to the wedges @xmath0 & @xmath21 as @xmath22 .",
    "the transformation relating the rindler coordinate to the minkowski coordinate then becomes @xmath23 now the maximal extension of the rindler coordinate system @xmath24 is the minkowski @xmath25 which is defined everywhere throughout the four rindler wedges , i.e. the entire minkowski plane , irrespective of accelerated horizons which the rindler observer encounters .",
    "the rindler coordinates however undergo a finite shift through the horizon , as can easily be seen through a comparison of ( [ transformations ] ) and ( [ transformationsext ] ) . a relation between the @xmath26",
    "coordinate pair outside ( region @xmath1 ) and inside ( region @xmath0 ) can then be written as @xmath27 the @xmath28 and @xmath29 coordinates on the other hand , remain unchanged across the horizon .",
    "it is to be noted that the transformation @xmath30 also suffice in relating the coordinates @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "however this second pair leads to some problems in taking the classical limit of the tunneling probability , and so is not considered at the accelerated horizon , as will be discussed later .",
    "such transforms were reported earlier in @xcite .",
    "the massless klein gordon equation @xmath31 , written in the rindler metric ( [ genrintor ] ) , reads @xmath32 + \\partial_y^2\\phi + \\partial_z^2\\phi = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the metric is independent of the coordinates @xmath33 & @xmath29 , i take an ansatz for @xmath34 as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a constant .",
    "this @xmath36 is related to the locally observed energy @xmath37 at some rindler spacetime point @xmath18 through a red - shift @xcite relation @xmath38 connecting the observed energies @xmath39 & @xmath40 at two different points in a gravitating system at equilibrium .",
    "the result ensures that though the observed energies @xmath41 and the _ tolman red - shift _",
    "factor @xmath42 vary locally as functions of the coordinates ( here @xmath18 ) , their product @xmath36 is a constant . in a gravitational system in equilibrium , this condition of the constancy of @xmath36 characterizes the equilibrium , just as is done by temperature in a laboratory thermodynamic system at thermal equilibrium @xcite . here , this locally observed energy @xmath41 is the energy @xmath37 of the tunneling - particle and the quantity @xmath42 becomes @xmath43 .",
    "thus i have @xmath44 where appropriate definitions @xmath45 ( _ see metrics _ [ genrind ] & [ genrintor ] ) have been used . substituting the ansatz ( [ sansatz ] ) in the klein gordon equation ( [ kg ] ) , yields the following differential equation in @xmath46 @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "some observations can immediately be made from equation ( [ reducedkg ] ) .",
    "near the horizon , as @xmath49 , the term containing @xmath50 drops out and a simple harmonic type equation with plane wave solutions is obtained .",
    "again at large spatial distances , @xmath51 , and now the term containing @xmath52 becomes negligible .",
    "this leaves an equation with exponentially increasing and decreasing solutions @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 represent the zero - th order modified bessel functions of first and second types respectively . thus throwing away the @xmath55 solutions , we have an exponentially vanishing solution at infinity , in @xmath56 .",
    "similar conclusions have also been reached at by boulware @xcite .",
    "the solution of the full equation ( [ reducedkg ] ) that is well defined through the horizon is , @xmath57 where @xmath58 are arbitrary integration constants . for small arguments ,",
    "the appropriate expansion of the modified bessel function is @xmath59 .",
    "this holds if @xmath60 and also especially near the horizon where @xmath61 .",
    "therefore ( [ phix ] ) simplifies to @xmath62 the total wave function @xmath63 near the horizon is then @xmath64}\\ + \\nonumber\\\\ & b_{\\mathsf{\\scriptscriptstyle out } } e^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\left[\\omega(t - x_\\star ) + k_y y+k_z z \\right]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with all the constants clubbed together within @xmath65 .",
    "the subscript ` @xmath66 ' here stands for the ingoing mode which travels toward the accelerated horizon at @xmath67 , while the subscript ` @xmath68 ' stands for the outgoing mode traveling away from horizon , i.e. towards @xmath69 .",
    "spinors are introduced on a general curved spacetime with metric @xmath71 , by going to a local lorentz frame with metric @xmath72 , at each spacetime point @xcite .",
    "this procedure is best done by constructing tetrad fields which map curved spacetime tensors to local lorentz frame and vice - versa . for a rindler metric in the tortoise - like coordinate system ( [ genrintor ] ) , the tetrad field @xmath73 is defined through the relation @xmath74 where latin ( @xmath75 ) and greek ( @xmath76 ) letters run over local lorentz and curved space indices respectively .",

    "solution for the full equation ( [ abeqns ] ) turns out to be @xmath103.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is to be noted that both ( [ absolns ] ) and ( [ phix ] ) are full solutions of the respective differential equations ( [ abeqns ] ) and ( [ reducedkg ] ) , without any approximations of parameters .",
    "this can be easily verified by substituting back these solutions in the original differential equations , to see that they satisfy them without using any approximations on the parameters .",
    "however , an approximation is used to get a simpler solution from ( [ absolns ] ) , by using the appropriate expansion of the modified bessel function for small arguments which is given as @xmath59 .",
    "this holds if @xmath60 and also especially near the horizon where @xmath61 .",

    "uptil now , i had found single - particle wave - functions for bosons and fermions , by solving for the klein - gordon and dirac equations in the rindler coordinates .",
    "these solutions are valid in both rindler wedges @xmath1 and @xmath0 , but in coordinates @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively .",
    "classically , both the ingoing and outgoing modes ( say of a virtual pair instantaneously produced ) in wedge @xmath0 are trapped , as nothing from inside can cross the horizon and come out to wedge @xmath1 .",

    "the unruh temperature was identified via a comparison between the calculated thermal distribution and the standard form of bose or fermi distributions .",
    "however , the temperature can also be calculated directly via tunneling .",
    "say , when an observer in rindler wedge @xmath1 observes an outgoing particle , coming from within wedge @xmath0 , he will see the wave function from inside wedge @xmath0 with a factor as shown in equation ( [ scalaroutin ] ) for scalar particles , and in ( [ fermoutin ] ) for fermions . the ingoing wave , however",
    ", does not change by such a factor between the two wedges . to calculate the temperature",
    ", we can now use the principle of detailed balance , @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the outgoing / ingoing probability , @xmath37 is the observed energy at that point and @xmath5 is the temperature .",
    "this gives the unruh temperature @xmath139 after suitably using the red - shift definition of @xmath36 given in ( [ redshift ] ) at the observer s point . for a more detailed discussion on the connection between the earlier approaches to tunneling and the one used in this paper , the reader",
    "is directed to @xcite .",
    "another point to note concerns an apparent ambiguity in the sign of the factors chosen to connect the coordinates between wedges @xmath1 and @xmath0 in equation ( [ 1_2relation ] ) .",
    "it can be verified that the relations @xmath30 , which have a change in sign between the @xmath15 and @xmath18 term signs , also connect the transformations ( [ transformations ] ) and ( [ transformationsext ] ) .",
    "however this set is not employed as it produces an exponential factor with a wrong exponent sign @xmath140 in the relations between wave - functions in wedges @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( [ scalaroutin ] & [ fermoutin ] ) . with this alternate sign ,",
    "the probability of outgoing particles to tunnel out across the horizon , diverges at the classical limit of @xmath141 .",
    "this is clearly unacceptable .",
    "so this obvious criterion of conformity with classical limit is used to remove the above said ambiguity of signs .",
