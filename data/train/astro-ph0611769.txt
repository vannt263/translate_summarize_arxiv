    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it appears that smmj14011 + 0252 and smgs in general have sufficiently high mass surface densities to be above the critical point in the study of @xcite .",
    "population synthesis fits of the stellar population of smm14011@xmath00252 yield ages of up to a few 100 myrs , similar to the ages of typical radio detected smgs with spectroscopic redshifts ( @xmath5 few 100 myrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on the infrared luminosity and the gas mass , we estimate a gas consumption time scale of about 30 - 40 myrs for smm14011@xmath00252 . from a larger sample of smgs with co detections , @xcite set a limit on the gas consumption time scale of @xmath19240 myrs , consistent with that for smm14011@xmath00252 .",
    "thus individual smgs appear to be forming most of their stars in intense bursts of moderate duration ( a few 100 myr ) .",
    "in addition , their star - formation appears to be highly `` bursty '' independent of the duration of the star - formation .",
    "the duty cycles of smgs have been estimated through a variety of methods to about @xmath193 @xcite .",
    "again , smgs seem to form their stars in intense bursts of modest durations with long periods of relative inactivity . to explain the fractions of local galaxies with strong 4000  breaks , @xcite infer gas consumption time scales of @xmath194100 myrs , similar to estimates of smgs .",
    "as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : wind ] , smm14011@xmath00252 is driving a vigorous superwind .",
    "while the importance of starburst driven winds to galaxy evolution is generally agreed upon , they are not thought to be powerful enough or to accelerate material to the escape velocities of the most massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , smm14011@xmath00252 is driving a wind , which at the very least will lower the overall star - formation efficiency of smm14011@xmath00252 ( see discussion in ",
    "[ subsec : sfintens ] and  [ subsec : selfreg ] ) .",
    "if this is indeed a general characteristic of smgs , then the role of winds in their ultimate evolution could be substantial .",
    "hence , the `` submillimeter bright phase '' of galaxies is characterized by high surface mass densities , above the interesting dividing point of the characteristics of local galaxies as found by @xcite .",
    "their star formation appears to be episodic ( duty cycle of @xmath1940.1 ) and of relatively short duration ( few 100 myrs , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and they have evidence for feedback which we have suggested may regulate the intensity of their star - formation .",
    "this adds further evidence that smgs do indeed have all the characteristics necessary to become local massive early type galaxies .",
    "we presented an integral - field study of the rest - frame optical emission line gas in the @xmath91 smmj14011@xmath00252 j1/j2 complex , allowing unprecedented insight into the nature of a high - redshift starburst and its outflow . identifying j1c as a z@xmath50.25 interloper through sersic profile and sed fitting , we removed the seeing - matched j1c contamination from the images , and find that j1n and j1s appear as individual components in all wavebands , at a projected distance of a few kpc .",
    "the positions of these two components are in excellent agreement with the distribution of  emission in our spiffi  map and also with the  velocity field , which is reminiscent of two nearby co - rotating disks which are marginally resolved spatially . including j2 , smmj14011 + 0252 thus appears as a triple system . from the j2 orbital motion",
    ", we estimate a dynamical mass of @xmath195  for the j1n / j1s complex .",
    "the dust - enshrouded j1n is the most massive component , as indicated by its stellar mass , @xmath5few @xmath196  ( compared to @xmath197  for j1s and j2 ) , and the bright co line emission , which coincides with j1n within the astrometric uncertainties .",
    "the starburst in j1n is `` maximal '' with similar intensity ( @xmath198  yr@xmath7 kpc@xmath104 ) comparable to the apparent limit at low redshift . the  half - light radius is similar to the  half - light radii in low - redshift ulirgs .",
    "overall , star formation in j1n is intense , but its properties do not greatly differ from low - redshift ulirgs , highlighting the similarity between smgs and ulirgs at optical wavelengths , i.e. , in the extended gas .",
    "given these similarities and the complex large - scale kinematics , j1 does not appear to be a good candidate for an alternative , highly efficient `` high - redshift mode '' of star - formation , but appears governed by similar rules as low - redshift galaxies with intense star - formation , although it may be `` scaled up '' @xcite .",
    "the intense starburst in j1 drives a superwind , as evident from blue emission line asymmetries , offsets between rest - frame uv interstellar absorption lines relative to , and enhanced [ nii]6583/  line ratios in j1n .",
    "the [ nii]/  ratios correlate with [ nii ] line width , indicating an increasing contribution of mechanical heating as the gas is accelerated in the wind , similar to low redshift starburst - driven winds .",
    "measured densities ( from the [ oii]3726,3729 , [ sii]6717,6731 doublets ) indicate pressures of @xmath199 dynes cm@xmath104 , similar to pressures estimated in the expanding bubbles of over - pressurized hot gas in local starburst galaxies .",
    "these results are a direct indication that the basic physics of starburst - driven winds are rather similar at low and at high redshift , and supports the approach of studying local starburst galaxies to better understand the basic mechanisms of high - redshift galaxy formation .",
    "the strong wind may explain why  equivalent width and reddening in smmj14011 + 0252 are positively correlated , which is likely a sign of patchy extinction .",
    "the bluer component of the smmj14011@xmath00252 system , j2 , is very different from j1 , with mass @xmath200  estimated from the narrow emission lines and sed fitting .",
    "its gas - phase oxygen abundance , measured from r@xmath177 , @xmath201= 8.5 $ ] , about 0.4 dex lower than in j1 ( paper  i ) .",
    "this signals that the two galaxies have had independent evolutionary histories , and that j2 is likely going to be accreted by the more massive j1n .",
    "the `` submillimeter bright phase '' of galaxies , which smm14011@xmath00252 is now in , is characterized by high surface mass densities , their star formation appears to be episodic and of relatively short durations , and they have evidence for feedback .",
    "these are just the characteristics needed to form early type spheroid dominated galaxies in the local universe @xcite .",
    "we find that only j1n has the necessary stellar mass surface density @xmath202 m@xmath16 kpc@xmath104 , while the blue components appear less concentrated .",
    "with their current star - formation time scales , however , it appears unlikely that they are likely to substantially change the final characteristics of the most massive component j1n .",
