    "carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) have remarkable electronic properties related with their unique geometrical structure.@xcite for example , the way in which the graphene sheet is wound into a cylinder determines whether cnts are metals or semiconductors.@xcite recent advances have made the measurements of electrical properties of individual single - wall cnts possible.@xcite most recently , orbital magnetic moments of a single - wall cnt have been detected , where the presence of moment is deduced from the shift of energy levels in external magnetic fields.@xcite since the magnitude of magnetic moments estimated in the experiment is about ten times the bohr magneton , the cnt as a molecular solenoid has attracted attention .",
    "semiclassically , the large orbital magnetic moments can be understood as an effect of chiral currents , for which several semiclassical calculations have been done based on boltzmann s equation.@xcite however , the approach , being applicable when the transport is diffusive and lacks coherence , can not treat purely quantum mechanical effects .",
    "quantum mechanical treatments of magnetic properties of cnts have previously been given,@xcite but those studies have concentrated on the energy shift and moment of an isolated cnt in external magnetic fields in equilibrium , so the currents and the effects of electrodes have not been studied . since ballistic transport can be strongly affected by electrodes , we need to take account of the influence of electrodes in cnts , which is exactly our motivation here . in the process , the quantum loop current , a purely quantum mechanical effect , has turned out to be indeed large , which we study by making use of the nonequilibrium green s function method.@xcite    a loop current has been studied in the context of small molecules placed between the scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) tip and the substrate . specifically , nakanishi and tsukada@xcite and tsukada _",
    "et al._@xcite have shown that a loop current can be dramatically amplified when the energy of the injected electron is resonant with degenerate eigenstates of an isolated molecule .",
    "this mechanism should also be applicable to cnts , for which a special interest is the effect of inherent degeneracies associated with wave functions traveling clockwise and anticlockwise around the tube .",
    "we develop a perturbation expansion of the nonequilibrium green s function in the weak coupling between the conductor and electrodes .",
    "this serves to identify how the loop current paths are determined in terms of phase variation of wave functions .",
    "the peculiarity of the cnts appears as their band structure that can satisfy the condition for large orbital magnetic moments .",
    "we then numerically calculate the current distribution and the magnitude of the orbital magnetic moments as a function of the bias voltage , which confirms the analytic discussions .",
    "the order of magnitude of the magnetic moment obtained in the numerical calculation is consistent with the value estimated in the experiment.@xcite throughout this brief report , we consider metallic cnts in the absence of external magnetic fields .",
    "cnts are characterized by the chiral index @xmath0 in standard literatures,@xcite where cnts are metals when @xmath1 or semiconductors otherwise.@xcite here we concentrate on the one - body problem .",
    "we employ the tight - binding model whose hamiltonian is @xmath2 here , @xmath3 is the tight - binding hamiltonian for the single - wall cnt , @xmath4 describes the connection between the cnt and the electrodes , @xmath5 describes the electrodes , @xmath6 are the sites connecting the cnt and the electrodes and @xmath7 are the respective transfer integrals [ see fig .

    "this reduces the problem to the sample alone , with the effects of electrodes contained in the self - energy @xmath22 .",
    "we can perform perturbation expansions in terms of the weak coupling @xmath23 .",

    "[ cylinder](a ) .",
    "only when the electrodes are attached asymmetrically ( @xmath91 ) does the loop current arise , which immediately resolves a puzzle one might have on the symmetry : how a specific sense of rotation of the circulating current can arise when the cylindrical conductor has no structural chirality ( as in zigzag or armchair cnts ) .",

    "this factor expresses that loop currents are generated due to interference between the doubly degenerate states . since these resonant states ( encircled in fig .",
    "[ band ] ) that participate in electronic transport lie near @xmath96 , the range of the value of @xmath70 is determined by the band structure of the conductor in general .",
    "in particular , the metallic cnts with @xmath97 have@xcite ( see fig . [ band ] ) @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the greatest common divisor of @xmath0 and @xmath100 the length of the translational vector along the circumference .",
    "thus , armchair cnts with @xmath101 should have nearly zero magnetic moments , which is contrasted with zigzag cnts for which magnetic moments are large .",
    "chiral cnts can have either @xmath102 or @xmath103 , so even chiral structures , which may naively seem to guarantee a molecular solenoid , can have large moments only when the dispersion is correct .",

    "we can immediately see that the current circulating around the tube is much larger than the one flowing along the axis , which endorses the discussion above .",
    "figure [ current3](a ) shows the total current flowing along the axis of the cnt as the function of the bias voltage .",
    "we can see that the current along the axis is nearly discretized , which is due to the resonant tunneling from a 1d electrode through the discrete electron levels existing at regular intervals in a cnt .",
    "figure [ current3](b ) shows the total current circulating around the tube versus bias voltage , which is indeed larger than the current along the axis with a ratio @xmath111 .",
    "the behavior consists of steps , but this time the increment of the current is not constant .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that the contribution to the current ( or the orbital magnetic moment ) from a pair of resonant eigenstates @xmath53 differs from pair to pair [ @xmath112 , eq .",

    "we also consider the magnetic field @xmath122 generated by the circulating currents .",
    "we must satisfy @xmath123 for the energy shift due to this to be negligible .",

    "here , we have concentrated on the one - body problem .",
    "the effects of the electron - electron interaction appear in , e.g. , coulomb blockade@xcite and tomonaga - luttinger liquid state.@xcite so we need to take the interaction into account to describe the real systems more accurately , which is a future problem .",
    "another point is that , although the self - induced magnetic field is small as mentioned above , some cnts have large magnetic susceptibility,@xcite so its effect may be an interesting problem .",
    "also assumed is that each electrode touches only one atom of the cnts .",
    "we have checked that the loop current is not significantly affected even when each electrode touches more than one atoms in the cnt .",
