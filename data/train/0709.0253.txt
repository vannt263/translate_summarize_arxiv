    "the latest results from the wmap satellite @xcite confirm the success of the @xmath5cdm model , where @xmath6 75 % of the mass - energy density is in the form of dark energy , and matter , most of it in the form of cold dark matter ( cdm ) making up the remaining 25 % .",
    "neutrinos with masses on the ev scale or below will be a hot component of the dark matter and will free - stream out of overdensities and thus wipe out small - scale structures .",
    "this fact makes it possible to use observations of the clustering of matter in the universe to put upper bounds on the neutrino masses .",
    "a thorough review of the subject is found in @xcite . with the improved quality of cosmological data seen in recent years",
    ", the upper limits have improved , and some quite impressive claims have been made in the recent literature , e.g. @xcite .",
    "present cosmological neutrino mass limits make use of the suppression effect of the neutrino free - streaming at a fixed , given redshift . as our ability to map out the mass distribution at different epochs of the cosmic history improves , by doing , e.g. , weak lensing tomography , we will gain sensitivity by in addition using the effect of massive neutrinos on the growth rate of density fluctuations .",
    "one key issue which then arises is possible degeneracies between neutrino masses and cosmological parameters . in this paper",
    "we focus on the degeneracy between the dark energy equation of state and the neutrino masses .",
    "we show that the combined effect of neutrinos and dark energy can be parametrized in a simple manner , and that the degeneracy can be broken by mapping out the large - scale structure over a reasonably wide range of redshifts .",
    "we also explore the effect of massive neutrinos on the matter power spectrum p(k ) , and we modify the formula given by eisenstein & hu @xcite , such that it would be valid for realistic properties of massive neutinos .",
    "the dependencies of three important ingredients of the universe on the equation of state parameter @xmath3 and the neutrino density @xmath7 are shown in table [ table : geometry ] .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we contrast common approximations to the power spectrum of fluctuations with the exact results from camb , and we provide a new modified approximation . in section iii we provide a new fitting formula for the linear theory growth of perturbations in the presence of massive neutrinos . in section iv we discuss the parameter degeneracy between dark energy parameters and neutrino masses , and we illustrate how it manifests itself in peculiar velocities and the integrated sachs wolfe effect .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section v.    .the ability of observational tests based on geometry , matter power spectrum and linear growth to probe neutrino mass and dark energy . in the text",
    "we discuss the sensitivity of @xmath8 to neutrino mass . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : fkall ]    numerical values for @xmath9 as a function of @xmath10 are given in table ii .",
    "they vary over the redshift range @xmath11 up to @xmath12 .",
    "specifically for @xmath13 we recorded the @xmath14 given by cmbfast , and the resulting approximation is given as : @xmath15 this formula is valid for @xmath16 , and its accuracy is quite high for @xmath17 , see figure [ fig : fitfw ] .",
    "performance at @xmath18 or at @xmath19 is at most @xmath20 worse than the @xmath17 case .",
    "as expected @xmath21 on very large scales where @xmath22 .",
    "on very small scales , where @xmath23 , we would expect that @xmath24^{\\alpha_{0}}$ ] based on equation ( [ eq : eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq : alpha_0 ] ) , ie .",
    "another approximation on these small scales follows from equation ( [ eq : julien ] ) , and by @xcite",
    ". however we note that this is based on the solution equation ( [ eq : deltap ] ) , which is only valid for an einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "we find that by solving the set of equations ( [ eq : fgrow1 ] ) , ( [ eq : second ] ) for a @xmath5 dominated universe , @xmath26 , for @xmath27 , compared to @xmath28 of equations ( [ eq : julien]),([eq : deltap ] ) .",
    "we emphasize again this is only valid on very small scales , and for intermediate scales one should use equation ( [ eq : mu ] ) .     with @xmath29 and with redshift at a fixed scale 8@xmath30 .",
    "the ratio @xmath31 is shown as a function of @xmath32 for z=1 and z=2 .",
    "he following examples are shown : @xmath33(dashed line ) , @xmath17(dotted line ) , @xmath34(dash - dotted line ) and @xmath35(dash - triple dotted line).the solid line is @xmath36 , from equation ( [ eq : fsimple ] ) , and the long - dashed line is the full polynomial found in equation ( [ eq : fgrow5 ] ) , evaluated at @xmath37.other parameters kept fixed @xmath38.,width=340,height=188 ]     and @xmath39 for @xmath40 ( full line ) and @xmath41 ( dotted line ) , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , at @xmath37 on 8 @xmath30 scale .",
    "the contour levels correspond to values of @xmath4 using equation ( [ eq : fgrow5]).,width=340,height=226 ]",
    "hannestad @xcite pointed out that cosmological neutrino mass limits are considerably weakend if one allows for @xmath45 ( a case which is peculiar , as in this case the density will increase with the expansion of the universe ) . in his analysis ,",
    "the parameter combination @xmath46 instead of @xmath44 was varied , and the explanation of the degeneracy he gave was as follows : since @xmath47 determines the small - scale suppression of the matter power spectrum , one can compensate for a larger @xmath48 by increasing @xmath49 . if one assumes a fixed @xmath40 in the analysis , the hubble diagram from supernovae type ia rule out values of @xmath49 much larger than @xmath50 .",
    "however , if one allows for @xmath45 , then the supernova data are compatible with considerably larger values of @xmath49 , and hence a higher value of @xmath48 can be accomodated by a given value of @xmath44 .",
    "the degeneracy described above between @xmath48 and @xmath3 is indirect .",
    "we also emphasize again and again that the suppression is not just a function of @xmath44 .",
    "the degeneracy is most relevant when the _ shape _ of the matter power spectrum @xmath51 at @xmath52 ( or another fixed redshift ) is used to constrain the neutrino mass ( i.e. the bias between the galaxy distribution and total mass distribution is assumed constant and marginalized over ) .",
    "dark energy with a constant equation of state does not cluster on the scales probed by galaxy redshift surveys and does not affect the shape of the matter power spectrum , and hence @xmath3 affects the limit indirectly through the mechanism described above . furthermore , the degeneracy is almost completely broken when using the wmap 3-year data as opposed to the first year @xcite .",
    "+ based on the considerations in the previous subsections of this paper we would expect there to be a further and more direct degeneracy between @xmath44 and @xmath3 : the same linear growth rate can result from a range of combinations of values of @xmath3 and @xmath44 . in physical terms , this degeneracy can be understood as follows : neutrino free - streaming will supress growth of structure on small scales . however , decreasing @xmath3 ( for fixed @xmath49 ) prolongs the era of structure formation , and reduces the value of the hubble parameter in the matter - dominated phase .",
    "the hubble parameter acts as a ` friction term ' in equation ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) , so reducing it will enhance the linear growth factor , see equation ( [ eq : hubble ] ) . to sum up",
    ", one can at least partly compensate for increasing @xmath44 by decreasing @xmath3 .",
    "this degeneracy would be relevant if one were to use the growth of structure to constrain @xmath44 and @xmath3 . in figure ( [ fig : fig4 ] ) we illustrate this by plotting the root - mean - square mass fluctuation amplitude @xmath53 as a function of redshift , for four different combinations of @xmath3 and @xmath44 .",
    "the middle panel shows the situation when if only the growth rate is measured ( normalized at @xmath52 ) : in that case distinguishing between the four cases will require very accurate measurements .",
    "the situation is better when the absolute values of the fluctuations are measured , as shown in the top panel of figure ( [ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "this can be understood by noting that the absolute values depend , in the case when we normalize to the cmb on large scales , on @xmath3 , but is only weakly dependent on @xmath44 .",
    "the reason for this is that dark energy fluctuations are relevant on scales of the size of the horizon , and dominate integrated sachs - wolfe effect on the very largest scales .",
    "in contrast , the main effect of neutrinos on the cmb is on smaller scales through a small shift in the position of the peaks and a slight enhancement of their amplitude .",
    "thus , if the large - scale normalization is combined with a measurement of the growth rate , the degeneracy between @xmath3 and @xmath44 may to a large extent be broken .",
    "figure [ fig : fwcont ] also shows the degeneracy of @xmath54 and @xmath3 through the linear growth factor @xmath4 .",
    "as indicated in table [ table : geometry ] , there is an interplay in the roles of neutrino mass and the de equation of state , when estimated observationally , which depend on geometry , the growth rate of perturbations and the shape of the power spectrum .",
    "we discuss briefly two probes where results from this paper , in particular the growth rate @xmath4 in equation ( [ eq : fgrow5 ] ) , could help in understanding degeneracy .",
    "+ the first is peculiar velocities ( see e.g. @xcite for review ) . the rms bulk flow is predicted in linear theory as : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a window function , e.g. @xmath57 for a gaussian sphere of radius @xmath58 .",
    "the velocity field at low redshift is insensitive to geometry .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath51 depends on the neutrino mass , but not on dark energy .",
    "massive neutrinos would suppress bulk flows @xcite .",
    "however in @xcite any dependence of @xmath4 on neutrino mass and dark energy was ignored .",
    "our equation ( [ eq : fgrow5 ] ) shows such dependence , which would result in extra suppression of the bulk flows and in some degeneracy with @xmath3 .",
    "this is also relevant on redshift distortion .",
    "a second cosmological probe which depends on @xmath4 is the integrated sachs wolfe effect derived from cross - correlation of the cmb with galaxy samples @xcite . in the small angle approximation",
    "the predicted spherical harmonic amplitudes are ( e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath59p\\left(\\frac{\\ell+1/2}{r}\\right ) \\label{eq : isw}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is a radial selection function for the galaxy survey , @xmath61 is the galaxy biasing factor , and @xmath62 is the linear theory growth function .",
    "the approximate relations for @xmath4 , @xmath63 and @xmath51 are useful to explore the degeneracies between neutrino mass and dark energy . as a simple illustration",
    ", we show in figure ( [ fig : figisw ] ) the product @xmath64 in the integrand above .",
    "we see that the selection function must extend to higher redshifts to distinguish between neutrino masses and @xmath65 .",
    "see @xcite for further analysis on the isw effect in the presence of massive neutrinos .",
    "we have demonstrated that the popular heuristic formula for the linear theory suppression of the matter fluctuations by free - streaming neutrinos , @xmath66 , is valid only on very small scales ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "however , it is not of practical use as this is in the strongly non - linear regime of matter clustering .",
    "we also provide a modified code for the e@xmath68h fitting formula . the linear growth factor in models with both massive neutrinos and",
    "a dark energy component with equation of state parameter @xmath69constant , has been calculated numerically , and we have provided a fitting formula justified by simple arguments .",
    "furthermore , we have explained the indirect degeneracy between @xmath3 and @xmath70 found in @xcite , and argued that there is a further , more direct degeneracy between @xmath3 and @xmath44 when the linear growth rate of density perturbations is considered .",
    "this degeneracy can , however , be lifted by measurements of the absolute scale of the mass fluctuations , for example from the cmb .",
