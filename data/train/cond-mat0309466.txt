    "<S> the model could also be relevant for dendritic growth at very small undercooling by introducing anisotropy @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our phase - field model has the advantage of being very simple to be implemented on a computer and contains a complete description of all the nonlinear and nonlocal properties of the macroscopic model . </S>",

    "<S> we then present numerical solutions showing how our phase - field model reproduces the main features of the viscous fingering problem such as the dynamic competition of modes and the formation of a steady state finger . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the model an attractive tool to be used to study problems that would not be easily feasible with traditional methods such as the propagation of viscous fingering in the presence of quenched disorder . </S>"
