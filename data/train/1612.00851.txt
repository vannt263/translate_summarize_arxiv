    "this corresponds to constraints on the global winding numbers of the corresponding dimer model ( see ref .   for a definition specific to the honeycomb lattice dimer model ) , which must be enforced by any monte carlo procedure . note that these constraints are on the parity of these winding numbers , which are in any case only defined modulo @xmath125 unless one is at @xmath3 .    therefore , to convert this rejection - free myopic worm update procedure for dimers into a valid update scheme for the original spin system , we test the winding numbers ( modulo @xmath125 ) of the new dimer configuration to see if it satisfies these two global constraints .",

    "[ etavsz_psi ] . from these results , it is clear that @xmath191 is quasi - universal in the following sense : in the power - law ordered phase at @xmath3 on the triangular lattice , @xmath191 is independent of the actual details of the worm construction protocol , and data from the dep algorithm and the myopic algorithm together define a @xmath3 functional form @xmath216 .",

    ", we see that both the dep and myopic worm algorithms outperform the metropolis update scheme by a very wide margin .",
    "corresponding results for the autocorrelation times of @xmath217 are detailed in the supplemental material .",
    "our @xmath166 results for @xmath191 can also be compared to the findings of ref .  ,",
    "in which the efficiency of a plaquette - based generalization of the wolff cluster algorithm was studied in the context of the low temperature limit of the nearest neighbour triangular lattice ising antiferromagnet .",
    "comparing to these results , we find that our approach outperforms this earlier algorithm even in this simple case .",
    "additionally , this earlier approach does not generalize in an obvious way to systems with further neighbour couplings , while the approach described here is designed to incorporate such further - neighbour couplings in a straightforward way .",
    "it is natural to wonder if the dual worm strategies introduced here could be ported to quantum monte carlo simulations of frustrated models .",
    "unfortunately , no straightforward generalization of this type appears possible .",
    "the difficulty is that a worm which alters the state on a given `` time - slice '' of the quantum monte carlo configuration also introduces unphysical off - diagonal terms in the hamiltonian , which correspond to ring - exchanges over large loops ( in the language of the dual quantum dimer model ) . in this context , it is worth nothing that the cluster construction strategy developed recently for frustrated transverse field ising models in ref .",
    "reduces , in the limit of vanishingly small transverse field , to a version of the kandel - ben av - domany plaquette - percolation approach .",
    "thus , generalizations to quantum systems appear to be more natural within that framework , rather than in the dual worm approach used here .",
    "finally , we note that the quasi - universal behaviour of the dynamical exponents @xmath191 and @xmath218 is very suggestive , throwing up the possibility that the statistics of worms constructed by these algorithms is universally determined by the long - wavelength properties of the underlying equilibrium ensemble .",
    "we hope to return to this in more detail in a future publication .",
