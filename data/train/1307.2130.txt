    "the development of accelerator technique for radioactive ion beams ( ribs ) help to study numerous experimental as well as theoretical measurements for nuclei far from @xmath3 - stability line .",
    "experimental methods and theoretical analysis have been widely used to collect information about the nuclear size , valence nucleon distribution and halo structure .",
    "the measurement of various cross sections like reaction cross section @xmath4 , nucleon removal cross section @xmath5 and longitudinal momentum distribution @xmath6 are some of the established tools for exploring unstable nuclei .",
    "island of inversion ( ioi ) is one of the most important current subjects in nuclear physics .",
    "this was first applied by warburton to a region of very neutron - rich nuclei from @xmath7ne to @xmath8 mg @xcite .",
    "discovery of the halo structure is another important progress of research on unstable nuclei .",
    "a halo structure of @xmath9ne was reported by the experiment on the one neutron removal reaction @xcite .",
    "experimentally this is the heaviest halo nucleus .",
    "the formation of halo in a nucleus near the drip - line is due to the very small binding of the valence particles .",
    "the quadrupole deformation of the halo is determined by the structure of the weakly bound valence orbital and it does not depend on the shape of the core @xcite . on the other hand existence of two",
    "nucleon halo is most unlikely in a deformed nucleus @xcite .",
    "it is shown by nunes @xcite with a variety of 3-body nn tensor force which goes beyond the usual pairing in hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) and the coupling due to core deformation / polarization significantly reduce the formation of 3-body borromean systems . in a recent work @xcite , halo phenomena in deformed nuclei",
    "are analysed within deformed relativistic hartree bogoliubov ( rhb ) theory and their finding in weakly bound @xmath10 mg nucleus indicates a decoupling of the halo orbitals from the deformed core agreeing with the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite .    to develop consistent nuclear reaction systematics along with the nuclear structure ,",
    "several theoretical models have been a matter of wide interest . in this context , the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) or the effective field theory motivated rmf ( e - rmf ) models provide the internal structure or sub - structure information of the nuclei through density distributions @xcite , which are used as input while calculating the observables in conjunction with glauber model @xcite .",
    "a systematic study of various nuclear reaction cross sections , such as the total nuclear reaction cross sections , differential elastic cross sections etc . enables us to know the nuclear structure of unstable nuclei in detail .",
    "this will also help in studying the formation of neutron - rich nuclei that are surrounded by a high pressure or temperature . in the present paper ,",
    "our aim is to calculate the bulk properties , such as binding energy ( be ) , root mean square charge radius @xmath11 , and quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath12 for ne , mg and si isotopes in the rmf and e - rmf formalisms .",
    "then we analyze the total nuclear reaction cross section @xmath0 for the scattering of @xmath13ne from a @xmath14c target at 240 mev / nucleon by using the densities obtained from the rmf formalisms @xcite in the frame work of glauber model .",
    "we have also predicted total reaction cross sections for ne , mg and si cases at different incident energies .",
    "the paper is designed as follows : the rmf / e - rmf formalisms and the reaction mechanism in the framework of glauber model are explained briefly in section ii .",
    "the results obtained from our calculations are discussed in section iii . in this section",
    "we intend to study the applicability of glauber model in the context of both stable and drip - line nuclei . finally , a brief summary and concluding remarks are given in the last section iv .",
    "the successful applications of rmf both in finite and infinite nuclear systems make more popular of the formalism in the present decades .",
    "the rmf model has been extended to the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) and density functional approach to study the static and dynamic aspects of exotic nuclear structure @xcite .",
    "the use of rmf formalism for finite nuclei as well as infinite nuclear matter are well documented and details can be found in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the working expressions for the density profile and other related quantities are available in @xcite .",
    "the details to calculate @xmath4 using glauber approach has been given by r. j. glauber @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the independent , individual nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath15 ) collisions along the eikonal @xcite .",
    "it has been used extensively to explain the observed total nuclear reaction cross - sections for various systems at high energies . the standard glauber form for the total reaction cross - sections at high energies",

    "the experimental nucleon - nucleon reaction cross - section @xmath24 varies with energy .",
    "the @xmath25-integrated densities @xmath26 are defined as @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the argument of @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) is @xmath29 , which stands for the impact parameter between the @xmath30 and @xmath31 nucleons .",
    "the original glauber model was designed for high energy approximation .",
    "however , it was found to work reasonably well for both the nucleus - nucleus reaction and the differential elastic scattering cross - sections over a broad energy range @xcite . to include the low energy effects of @xmath15 interaction , the glauber model",

    "it is worth mentioning that the result in glauber model is sensitive to the in - medium nn cross - section with proper treatment of the input densities @xcite and also depends on the accuracy of the profile function .    at intermediate energies ,",
    "medium effects can be taken into account on nucleon - nucleon cross - sections . in nn",
    "scattering the basic input is the nn elastic t - matrix .",
    "this t - matrix is modified to take into account nuclear medium effects in both projectile and target .",
    "a. bertulani et.al @xcite have shown that the nucleon knockout reactions involving halo nuclei are more sensitive to medium modifications compared to normal nuclei .",

    "then , the glauber model is used to calculate the total reaction cross - section for both the stable and unstable nuclei considered in the present study . in refs .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the glauber model can be used for relatively low energy even at 25 , 30 and 85 mev / nucleons .",
    "although it is a better prescription to take deformation into account directly through the transparency function [ eqn .",
    "( 4 ) ] , but to our knowledge no such scheme is available in this model . in our earlier calculations @xcite we have used the present approach to take deformation into account where the results are quite encouraging and show clear deformation effect .",
    "it is to be noted that similar methodology is also adopted by some other authors @xcite .",
    "also , it is important to note that the densities for halo - nuclei have long tails which generally are not reproduced quantitatively by harmonic oscillator expansion in a mean field formalism .",
    "we obtain the field equations for nucleons and mesons from the rmf and e - rmf lagrangian . for the deformed case ( rmf only ) , these equations are solved by expanding the upper and lower components of the dirac spinners and the boson fields in an axially deformed harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "the set of coupled equations are solved numerically by a self - consistent iteration method taking different inputs of the initial deformation @xmath45 @xcite . for spherical densities , we follow the numerical procedure of refs .",
    "@xcite for both rmf and e - rmf models .",
    "the constant gap bcs pairing is used to add the pairing effects for open shell nuclei . in the present calculations , we have dealt reaction studies for nuclei ne , mg and si with c target .",
    "all these nuclei are in the lower region of the mass table , where the contribution of pairing effect is minimal even for open shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "we also understand that pairing plays a crucial role for open shell nuclei for relatively heavier mass region .",
    "if one use the conventional pairing gaps similar to @xmath46 = 11.2/@xmath47 mev , then bcs treatment of pairing is not reliable .",
    "however , using small pairing gap near the dripline @xcite , this error can be minimised .",
    "we have used this scheme in our earlier calculations @xcite and able to reproduce the results with data till the dripline whenever available . the centre - of - mass motion ( c.m . )",
    "energy correction is estimated by the usual harmonic oscillator formula @xmath48 .",
    "since the main input in the glauber model estimation is the rmf or e - rmf densities , it is important to have information about these quantities .",
    "we have plotted the spherical @xmath49 and @xmath50 for both proton and neutron distributions of ne isotopes in figure 1 using rmf ( nl3 * ) parameter set @xcite .",
    "as expected , we find the values of @xmath50 and @xmath49 are almost similar for @xmath51ne which can be seen from figure 1 .",
    "extension of @xmath50 is much more than @xmath49 for rest of the nuclei .",
    "it is maximum for @xmath52ne in neon isotopic chain , because of high neutron to proton ratio for these cases .",
    "the axially deformed density for the halo case @xmath9ne is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the z - axis is chosen as the symmetry axis , the density is evaluated in the @xmath53 plane , where @xmath54 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is noticed that @xmath9ne possesses a @xmath55 cluster with a tetrahedral configuration .",
    "the structure of this neutron - rich @xmath9ne has an prolate ground state deformation .",
    "the density plot shows that the central part of the nucleus is a compact core , which is surrounded by a thin layer of nucleons .",
    "[ table 2 ]    [ table 2 ]    [ table 2 ]    we calculate the bulk properties , such as binding energy ( be ) , root mean square charge radius @xmath11 , and quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath12 for the neutron rich @xmath56ne , @xmath57 mg and @xmath58si isotopes in the rmf and e - rmf formalisms .",
    "the calculated nuclear structure results are compared with t. sumi et al . @xcite and available experimental data @xcite in tables 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "it is clear that our results agree remarkably well with the data .",
    "for example , the rmf binding energy for @xmath59ne is 131.8 mev and 135.3 mev from e - rmf where as the experimental value is 132.1 mev .",
    "similarly , the @xmath11 value for this nucleus is 2.963 , 3.055 and 2.972 fm for rmf , e - rmf and experiment respectively . a comparison with the study of t. sumi et al .",
    "@xcite for the deformation parameter @xmath12 is also given in table 1 .",
    "we found that the results are quite close with each other .    in the present study of @xmath4",
    ", we first use the spherical density obtained from rmf ( nl3*)@xcite .",
    "the results are presented in figure 3(a ) for @xmath60 and @xmath61 isotopes with @xmath62 target at 240 mev / nucleon projectile energy .",
    "these results deviate considerably from the data @xcite which are quoted in this figure .",
    "for example , in case of @xmath63ne+@xmath14c , the observed value of @xmath0 is @xmath64 mev as compared to the estimated results of 1440 mev with nl3 * parametrization .    in this context , it is interesting enough to see deformation effect on @xmath0 .",
    "we repeat the calculations for @xmath0 with the deformed densities ( rmf only ) as input in the glauber model @xcite .",
    "we obtained spherical equivalent of the axially deformed densities using equations ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) following the prescription of refs . @xcite .",
    "the nl3 * parameter set @xcite for this purpose is used and the results are presented in figures 3(b ) and 3(c ) .",
    "the parameter set nl3 * is reasonably a good set for these neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "it shows that most of the @xmath0 matches quite well with the experimental data of @xcite and still halo case does not agree in figure 3(b ) . in figure 3(c ) , we have taken core + one neutron case and found a remarkable agreement with the data . in figure 4 , we have made a comparison of our results with w. horiuchi et al .",
    "@xcite as well as with the data for the scattering of @xmath65 isotopes on @xmath62 target at 240 mev / nucleon . it is found that our results are little bit higher for relatively lower mass nuclei but there is better fitting for neutron rich side .",
    "summarising the whole discussion on reaction cross sections , in general , one can say that the spherical density used from rmf ( nl3 * ) fails to reproduce the data .",
    "when we use the deformed densities to evaluate the total nuclear reaction cross section , the predicted @xmath0 matches reasonably well with the experimental measurement . in figures 5 , 6 and 7 , we have presented the @xmath0 with various incident energies for ne , mg and si isotopes as projectiles and @xmath1 as target using the deformed nl3 * densities in the glauber model calculation .",
    "a comparison of oue results with w. horiuchi et al .",
    "@xcite for the scattering of mg and si isotopes on @xmath62 target at 240 mev / nucleon is also given in figure 8 .",
    "it is observed a similar trend as reported in @xcite .",
    "in summary , the binding energy , charge radius and quadrupole deformation parameter for the neutron - rich @xmath66 , @xmath57 mg and @xmath58si isotopes have been calculated using rmf ( nl3 * ) and e - rmf ( g2 ) formalisms .",
    "using the rmf densities , the reaction cross sections @xmath0 are evaluated in the glauber model .",
    "the @xmath0 are in good agreement with the experiments and also with the recent study by w. horiuchi et al @xcite , when we consider the deformation effect in the densities .",
    "it is also concluded in the present paper that deformation for total nuclear reaction cross section is important for stable nuclei as projectiles which reproduces the experimental data reasonably well . in @xmath67 halo case",
    ", the deformed core + one neutron shows better agreement with the data .",
