    "in the common perception , clifford algebras belong to modern mathematics . it may then be a point of surprise that the first appearance of spinors in mathematical literature is already more than two thousand years old !",
    "euclid s parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 of the pythagorean triples , first described by euclid in his _ elements _ , deserve the name of pythagorean spinors  as will be shown .    the existence of pythagorean triples , that is triples of natural numbers @xmath3 satisfying @xmath4 has been known for thousands of years .",
    "euclid ( ca 300 bce ) provided a formula for finding pythagorean triples from any two positive integers @xmath2 and @xmath1 , @xmath5 , namely : @xmath6 ( lemma 1 of book x ) .",
    "it easy to check that @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 so defined automatically satisfy eq .",
    "( 1.1 ) , i.e. , they form an integer right triangle .",
    "a pythagorean triple is called _ primitive _ if ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath10 are mutually prime , that is @xmath11 .",
    "every pythagorean triple is a multiple of some primitive triples .",
    "the primitive triples are in one - to - one correspondence with relatively prime pairs @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath5 , such that exactly one of ( @xmath2 , @xmath14 is even @xcite .    an indication that the pair ( @xmath15 forms a _ spinor _ description of pythagorean triples comes from the well - known fact that may be viewed as the square of an integer complex number . after recalling this in the next section ,",
    "we build a more profound analysis based on a 1:2 correspondence of the integer subgroups of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , from which the latter may be viewed as the corresponding pin group of the former . for that purpose we shall also introduce the concept of pseudo - quaternions ( `` kwaternions '' )  representing the minimal clifford algebra for the pseudo - euclidean space @xmath18 .",
    "the most surprising result concerns an apollonian gasket where all the objects mentioned acquire a geometric interpretation .",
    "squaring an integer complex number @xmath19+_ni _ will result in an integer complex number @xmath20 the norm of which turns out to be also an integer : @xmath21 this auspicious property gives a method of producing pythagorean triangles : just square any integer complex number and draw the result .",
    "for instance @xmath22 will produce 3 - 4 - 5 triangle , the so - called egyptian triangle ( figure  [ fig:2]b ) .",
    "@xmath23{cliff - f1}\\ ] ]    equation [ eq:2.1 ] is equivalent to euclid s formula for the parameterization of pythagorean triples @xcite .",
    "we shall however allow @xmath24 to be any integer complex number , and therefore admit triangles with negative legs ( but not hypotenuses ) .",
    "the squaring map @xmath25 ( exclude zero ) has a certain redundancy  both @xmath24 and  @xmath24 give the same pythagorean triple .",
    "this double degeneracy has the obvious explanation : squaring a complex number has a geometric interpretation of doubling the angle .",
    "therefore one turn of the parameter vector @xmath26 around the origin makes the pythagorean vector @xmath27 go twice around the origin .",
    "we know the analogue of such a situation from quantum physics .",
    "fermions need to be turned in the visual space twice before they return to the original quantum state ( a single rotation changes the phase of the `` wave function '' by 180@xmath28 ) .",
    "mathematically this corresponds to the group homomorphism of a double cover @xmath29 which is effectively exploited in theoretical physics @xcite .",
    "the rotation group @xmath30 is usually represented as the group of special orthogonal 3@xmath31 real matrices , and the unitary group @xmath32 is typically realized as the group of special unitary 2@xmath332 complex matrices .",
    "the first acts on @xmath34  identified with the visual physical space , and the latter acts on @xmath35  interpreted as the spin representation of states .",
    "one needs to rotate a visual vector twice to achieve a single rotation in the spinor space @xmath35 .",
    "this double degeneracy of rotations can be observed on the quantum level @xcite , @xcite .",
    "@xmath36{cliff - f2}\\ ] ]    the group of rotations @xmath30 has the topology of a 3-dimensional projective space , and as such has first fundamental group isomorphic to @xmath37 .",
    "thus it admits loops that can not be contracted to a point , but a double of a loop ( going twice around a topological `` hole '' ) becomes contractible .",
    "based on this fact , p.a.m .",
    "dirac designed a way to visualize the property as the so - called `` belt trick '' @xcite .",
    "this analogy between the relation of the pythagorean triples to the euclid s parameters and the rotations to spinors has a deeper level  explored in the following sections , in which we shall show that is a shadow of the double covering homomorphism @xmath38 .",
    "it shall become clear that calling the euclid parameterization @xmath39 a _ pythagorean spinor _ is legitimate .",
    "before we go on , note another interesting redundancy of the euclidean scheme .",
    "for a complex number @xmath40 define @xmath41 the square of this number brings @xmath42 with the norm @xmath43 .",
    "thus both numbers @xmath24 and @xmath44 give  up to scale  the same pythagorean triangle but with the legs interchanged .",
    "for instance both @xmath22 and @xmath45 give pythagorean triangles 3 - 4 - 5 and 8 - 6 - 10 , respectively ( both similar to the egyptian triangle ) .",
    "in euclid s recipe , only one of the two triangles is listed .",
