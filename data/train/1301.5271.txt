    "this is best possible when @xmath46 , but for larger values , this is only the best known construction .",
    "here is some additional information in support of the belief that large height is necessary when the dimension is large and the cover graph is planar . in 2010 ,",
    "felsner , li and trotter  @xcite proved the following result .",
    "[ thm : felsner - li - trotter ] let @xmath0 be poset of height  @xmath21 . if the cover graph of @xmath0 is planar , then @xmath35 .",
    "we note that theorem  [ thm : felsner - li - trotter ] is an easy corollary to the following theorems of brightwell and trotter  @xcite , @xcite , published in 1997 and 1993 , respectively .",

    "furthermore , if @xmath7 is a simple , @xmath20-connected planar graph , then the subposet determined by the vertices and faces is @xmath33-irreducible .",
    "the standard example @xmath52 shows that the inequality in theorem  [ thm : felsner - li - trotter ] is best possible . in  @xcite , it is conjectured that the dimension of a poset is bounded in terms of its height when the poset has a planar cover graph .",
    "however , it is also noted that the proof technique used for the case @xmath53 does not seem to extend when @xmath54 .",
    "nevertheless , using a quite different approach , streib and trotter  @xcite settled this conjecture in 2012 with the following result .",
    "[ thm : streib - trotter ] for every positive integer @xmath18 , there is a least positive integer @xmath55 so that if @xmath0 is a poset with a planar cover graph and the height of @xmath0 is at most @xmath18 , then @xmath56 .",
    "we should point out that although @xmath57 , for @xmath54 , the upper bound on the constant @xmath55 produced in the proof of theorem  [ thm : streib - trotter ] is very large , as several iterations of ramsey theory were used .",
    "there are some special cases where we can bound the dimension of a poset with a planar cover graph independent of its height .",
    "the first statement in the following theorem was proved by trotter and moore  @xcite in 1977 , and with the benefit of hindsight , one can argue that the line of research carried out in this paper might reasonably have been triggered 35 years ago .",
    "the last three inequalities were proved by felsner , trotter and wiechert  @xcite in 2011 .",
    "[ thm : bounded - dim ] let @xmath0 be a poset .    1 .",

    "4 .   if the comparability graph of @xmath0 is planar , then @xmath59 .",
    "all four inequalities in theorem  [ thm : bounded - dim ] are best possible . historically , we note that the first inequality was proved initially for height @xmath21 posets .",
    "later , it was realized that the same argument could be easily modified to work for all heights .",
    "subsequently , it was further recognized that the argument actually yielded a strengthening to a broader class of posets , and the following extension is given in  @xcite .",
    "[ thm : planar - with-0 ] if @xmath0 is a planar poset and has either a greatest element ( a one ) or a least element ( a zero ) , then @xmath58 .",
    "the proof of the first inequality in theorem  [ thm : bounded - dim ] then proceeds by showing that if @xmath0 is a poset whose cover graph is a tree , then we can attach a zero and still have a planar poset .",
    "the proof of the second inequality in theorem  [ thm : bounded - dim ] is relatively straightforward , but it takes a bit of work to show that it is best possible . the third inequality can be proved by modifying the details of the proof of the second .",
    "it can also be obtained as a corollary to theorem  [ thm : planar - with-0 ] .    by contrast , the proof of the fourth inequality in theorem  [ thm : bounded - dim ] is quite different from the other results in  @xcite .",
    "the argument depends on the full strength of the brightwell - trotter inequality for the dimension of the vertex - edge - face poset determined by a drawing of a planar multi - graph , with the edges now playing a key role .      to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the following observation concerning kelly s 1981 construction was not made until 2012:the cover graphs of the posets in this construction have bounded tree - width .",
    "in fact , they have bounded path - width .",
    "we leave the following elementary observation as an exercise .",
    "[ exe : kelly - pw ] let @xmath60 , let @xmath36 be the poset illustrated in kelly s construction , and let @xmath61 be the cover graph of @xmath36 .",

    "in fact , when @xmath34 , @xmath61 contains @xmath62 as a minor , so its path - width is exactly  @xmath20 .",
    "we made some effort to construct large dimension posets with bounded height and cover graphs having bounded tree - width and were unable to do so .",
    "so consider the following additional information :    1 .",
    "a poset whose cover graph has tree - width @xmath63 has dimension at most  @xmath20 .",
    "2 .   a poset whose cover graph is outerplanar has dimension at most  @xmath33 . outerplanar graphs can have arbitrarily large path - width , but they have tree - width at most  @xmath21 .",
    "3 .   on the one hand",
    ", the tree - width of the cover graph of a planar poset can be arbitrarily large , even when the height of @xmath0 is  @xmath21 . as an example , just take a height  @xmath21 poset whose cover graph is an @xmath64 grid . on the other hand , the proof given for theorem  [ thm : streib - trotter ] in  @xcite used a reduction to the case where the cover graph of the poset is both planar and has diameter bounded in terms of the height of the poset .",
    "it is well known that a planar graph of bounded diameter has bounded tree - width .",
    "taking into consideration this body of evidence together with our inability to prove otherwise , it is natural to conjecture that the dimension of a poset is bounded in terms of its height and the tree - width of its cover graph , and this is what we will now prove .",
    "let @xmath0 be a finite poset .",

    "all this implies that the paths in @xmath10 connecting @xmath239 to @xmath118 and @xmath115 to @xmath235 both pass through @xmath270 .",

    "it is not inconceivable that better techniques may enable one to find an exact formula for @xmath287 , for all @xmath9 and @xmath18 .    as noted in the introductory section , when the tree - width of the cover graph of @xmath0 is @xmath63 , @xmath293 , independent of the height of @xmath0 . also , when the cover graph of @xmath0 is outerplanar ( so it has tree - width at most  @xmath21 ) , @xmath59 independent of the height of @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , the posets in kelly s construction have path - width  @xmath20 .",
    "accordingly , it is natural to raise the following questions .",
    "[ que : pw=2 ] does there exist a constant @xmath2 so that if @xmath0 is a poset and the path - width of the cover graph of @xmath0 is at most @xmath21 , then @xmath294 ?",
    "[ que : tw=2 ] does there exist a constant @xmath295 so that if @xmath0 is a poset and the tree - width of the cover graph of @xmath0 is at most @xmath21 , then @xmath296 ?",
    "of course , if the answer to the second question is yes , then it is also yes for the first .",
    "it is also natural to ask whether large standard examples are necessary for large dimension when tree - width is bounded .",
    "formally , we ask whether for each pair @xmath297 of integers with @xmath298 , there is an integer @xmath299 so that if @xmath0 is a poset with ( 1 )  @xmath300 and ( 2 )  the tree - width of the cover graph of @xmath0 is at most @xmath9 , then @xmath0 contains the standard example @xmath23 .",
    "finally , we believe that the dimension of a poset is bounded whenever the height is bounded and its cover graph does not contain a fixed graph as a minor :    for every positive integer @xmath18 and every proper minor - closed class of graphs @xmath301 , there exists an integer @xmath2 so that if    1 .   @xmath0 is a poset of height at most @xmath18 , and 2 .",
    "the cover graph of @xmath0 belongs to @xmath301 ,    then the dimension of @xmath0 is at most  @xmath2 .",
    "our main theorem shows that the conjecture is true when @xmath301 is the class of graphs of tree - width at most @xmath9 . in  @xcite ,",
    "a general reduction is described which allows one to restrict to the case where the cover graph has bounded diameter ( as a function of the height ) .",
    "it follows as an immediate corollary that the conjecture holds whenever @xmath301 has the so - called _",
    "diameter tree - width _ property is said to have the diameter tree - width property if there exists a function @xmath302 such that for every graph @xmath303 , every vertex @xmath94 of @xmath7 , and every positive integer @xmath99 , every ball of radius at most @xmath99 around @xmath94 has tree - width at most @xmath304 . ] .",
    "as is well known , planar graphs have this property , and thus theorem  [ thm : streib - trotter ] from  @xcite may be viewed as a corollary to our main theorem  via the reduction to the bounded diameter case .",
    "graphs of bounded genus , and more generally graphs excluding an apex graph as a minor also have the diameter tree - width property ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the above conjecture holds in these special cases .",
    "the proof of our main theorem has been developed by the authors at a series of meetings at conferences and campus visits , as well as through email .",
    "however , we have also received valuable input from several other colleagues in our respective university environments ."
