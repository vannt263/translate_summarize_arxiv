    "car parking , first considered in a mathematical way by rnyi @xcite in 1958 , gives rise to interesting models that in several variations have been applied in many fields of science . in the original car parking problem ,",
    "unit length cars are appearing with constant rate in time and with constant density in space on the line where they try to park .",
    "a new car is allowed to park only in case there is no intersection with previously parked cars . otherwise the attempt is rejected .",
    "rnyi proved that the density of cars has the limit @xmath1 , the so - called parking constant . in the simplest discrete version of the car parking problem ,",
    "cars of length @xmath2 try to park at their midpoints randomly on @xmath0 .",
    "this model has been solved analytically as well @xcite .",
    "this model belongs to a wider class of more complicated models of deposition with exclusion interaction .",
    "usually such models are not analytically solvable . in physical chemistry `` cars ''",
    "become particles which are deposited in layers on a substrate , a process called random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) . a variety of related models are studied . for a review of recent developments",
    "see @xcite .",
    "moreover , models with more complicated graphs e.g. ( random ) trees have been investigated @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "multilayer variations of the model are used to describe multilayer adsorption of particles on a substrate @xcite and the sequential frequency assignment process @xcite which appears in telecommunication . in these papers",
    "it is also observed that the density in higher layers increases up from the first layer , which at first seems rather counterintuitive .",
    "heuristic arguments for monotonicity of densities were found in specific models @xcite , but no rigorous proofs could be given yet .",
    "moreover privman finds numerically a scaling behavior of the density in a similar rsa model @xcite with slightly different adhesion rules which is notoriously difficult to explain mathematically .    in the present paper we aim for a rigorous investigation and treat two versions of the discrete two - line car - parking problem with cars of length 2 .",
    "first we describe the dynamics of the car parking process without screening and also with screening .",
    "then we provide the _ solutions _ of these models by reducing them to closed finite dimensional systems of odes for densities of local patterns , see theorems [ theo1 ] and [ theo2 ] . that it is possible to find a finite - dimensional dynamical description is quite remarkable .",
    "it is not obvious , and in fact our method ceases to work for a three - line extension of the model without screening where an infinite system appears .",
    "a second remarkable fact is that , even without screening , the second line density is higher than the first .",
    "cars do not communicate or plan a common strategy and their arrival is random , but they seem to use the resources in the second line more efficiently , once they have been rejected in the first line .",
