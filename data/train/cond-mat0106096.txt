    "complex weblike structures describe a wide variety of systems of high technological and intellectual importance . for example , the cell is best described as a complex network of chemicals connected by chemical reactions ; the internet is a complex network of routers and computers linked by various physical or wireless links ; fads and ideas spread on the social network whose nodes are human beings and edges represent various social relationships ; the wold - wide web is an enormous virtual network of webpages connected by hyperlinks .",
    "these systems represent just a few of the many examples that have recently prompted the scientific community to investigate the mechanisms that determine the topology of complex networks .",
    "the desire to understand such interwoven systems has brought along significant challenges as well .",
    "physics , a major beneficiary of reductionism , has developed an arsenal of successful tools to predict the behavior of a system as a whole from the properties of its constituents .",
    "we now understand how magnetism emerges from the collective behavior of millions of spins , or how do quantum particles lead to such spectacular phenomena as bose - einstein condensation or superfluidity .",
    "the success of these modeling efforts is based on the simplicity of the interactions between the elements : there is no ambiguity as to what interacts with what , and the interaction strength is uniquely determined by the physical distance .",
    "we are at a loss , however , in describing systems for which physical distance is irrelevant , or there is ambiguity whether two components interact . while for many complex systems with nontrivial network topology such ambiguity is naturally present , in the past few years we increasingly recognize that the tools of statistical mechanics offer an ideal framework to describe these interwoven systems as well .",
    "these developments have brought along new and challenging problems for statistical physics and unexpected links to major topics in condensed matter physics , ranging from percolation to bose - einstein condensation .",
    "traditionally the study of complex networks has been the territory of graph theory . while graph theory initially focused on regular graphs , since the 1950 s large - scale networks with no apparent design principles were described as random graphs , proposed as the simplest and most straightforward realization of a complex network .",
    "random graphs were first studied by the hungarian mathematicians paul erds and alfrd rnyi . according to the erds - rnyi ( er ) model , we start with @xmath0 nodes and connect every pair of nodes with probability @xmath1 , creating a graph with approximately @xmath2 edges distributed randomly .",
    "this model has guided our thinking about complex networks for decades after its introduction .",
    "but the growing interest in complex systems prompted many scientists to reconsider this modeling paradigm and ask a simple question : are real networks behind such diverse complex systems as the cell or the internet , fundamentally random ?",
    "our intuition clearly indicates that complex systems must display some organizing principles which should be at some level encoded in their topology as well .",
    "but if the topology of these networks indeed deviates from a random graph , we need to develop tools and measures to capture in quantitative terms the underlying organizing principles .    in the past few years we witnessed dramatic advances in this direction , prompted by several parallel developments .",
    "first , the computerization of data acquisition in all fields led to the emergence of large databases on the topology of various real networks .",
    "second , the increased computing power allows us to investigate networks containing millions of nodes , exploring questions that could not be addressed before .",
    "third , the slow but noticeable breakdown of boundaries between disciplines offered researchers access to diverse databases , allowing them to uncover the generic properties of complex networks . finally , there is an increasingly voiced need to move beyond reductionist approaches and try to understand the behavior of the system as a whole . along this route ,",
    "understanding the topology of the interactions between the components , i.e. networks , is unavoidable .    motivated by these converging developments and circumstances , many quantities and measures have been proposed and investigated in depth in the past few years . however , three concepts occupy a prominent place in contemporary thinking about complex networks .",
    "next we define and briefly discuss them , a discussion to be expanded in the coming chapters .    _",
    "small worlds : _ the small world concept in simple terms describes the fact that despite their often large size , in most networks there is a relatively short path between any two nodes .",
    "the distance between two nodes is defined as the number of edges along the shortest path connecting them .",
    "the most popular manifestation of `` small worlds '' is the `` six degrees of separation '' concept , uncovered by the social psychologist stanley milgram ( 1967 ) , who concluded that there was a path of acquaintances with typical length about six between most pairs of people in the united states ( kochen 1989 ) .",
    "the small world property appears to characterize most complex networks : the actors in hollywood are on average within three costars from each other , or the chemicals in a cell are separated typically by three reactions . the small world concept , while intriguing , is not an indication of a particular organizing principle .",
    "indeed , as erds and rnyi have demonstrated , the typical distance between any two nodes in a random graph scales as the logarithm of the number of nodes . thus random graphs are small worlds as well .    _",
    "clustering : _ a common property of social networks is that cliques form , representing circles of of friends or acquaintances in which every member knows every other member .",
    "this inherent tendency to clustering is quantified by the clustering coefficient ( watts and strogatz 1998 ) .",
    "let us focus first on a selected node @xmath3 in the network , having @xmath4 edges which connect it to @xmath4 other nodes .",
    "if the first neighbors of the original node were part of a clique , there would be @xmath5 edges between them .",
    "the ratio between the number @xmath6 of edges that actually exist between these @xmath4 nodes and the total number @xmath5 gives the value of the clustering coefficient of node @xmath3 @xmath7 the clustering coefficient of the whole network is the average of all individual @xmath8 s .    in a random graph , since the edges are distributed randomly , the clustering coefficient is @xmath9 ( sect .",
    "[ sect_rand_clust ] ) .",
    "however , it was watts and strogatz who first pointed out that in most , if not all , real networks the clustering coefficient is typically much larger than it is in a random network of equal number of nodes and edges .    _",
    "degree distribution : _ not all nodes in a network have the same number of edges .",
    "the spread in the number of edges a node has , or node degree , is characterized by a distribution function @xmath10 , which gives the probability that a randomly selected node has exactly @xmath11 edges . since in a random graph",
    "the edges are placed randomly , the majority of nodes have approximately the same degree , close to the average degree @xmath12 of the network .",
    "the degree distribution of a random graph is a poisson distribution with a peak at @xmath13 . on the other hand recent empirical results",
    "show that for most large networks the degree distribution significantly deviates from a poisson distribution . in particular , for a large number of networks , including the world - wide web ( albert , jeong , barabsi 1999 ) , internet ( faloutsos _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) or metabolic networks ( jeong _ el al . _ 2000 ) , the degree distribution has a power - law tail @xmath14 such networks are called scale - free ( barabsi and albert 1999 ) . while some networks display an exponential tail , often the functional form of @xmath10 still deviates significantly from a poisson distribution expected for a random graph .    these three concepts , small path length , clustering and scale - free degree distribution have initiated a revival of network modeling in the past few years , resulting in the introduction and study of three main classes of modeling paradigms .",
    "first , random graphs , which are variants of the erds - rnyi model , are still widely used in many fields , and serve as a benchmark for many modeling and empirical studies .",
    "second , following the discovery of clustering , a class of models , collectively called small world models , have been proposed .",
    "these models interpolate between the highly clustered regular lattices and random graphs .",
    "finally , the discovery of the power - law degree distribution has led to the construction of various scale - free models that , by focusing on the network dynamics , aim to explain the origin of the power - law tails and other non - poisson degree distributions seen in real systems .",
    "the purpose of this article is to review each of these modeling efforts , focusing on the statistical mechanics of complex networks .",
    "our main goal is to present the theoretical developments in parallel with the empirical data that initiated and support the various models and theoretical tools . to achieve this , we start with a brief description of the real networks and databases that represent the testground for most current modeling efforts .",
    "the study of most complex networks has been initiated by a desire to understand various real systems , ranging from communication networks to ecological webs . thus the databases available for study span several disciplines . in this section",
    "we review briefly those that have been studied by researchers aiming to uncover the general features of complex networks . beyond the description of the databases",
    ", we will focus on the three robust measures of the network topology : average path length , clustering coefficient and degree distribution .",
    "other quantities , as discussed in the following chapters , will be again tested on these databases .",
    "the properties of the investigated databases , as well as the obtained exponents are summarized in tables [ table_cluster ] and [ table_gamma ] .",
    "the world - wide web ( www ) represents the largest network for which topological information is currently available .",
    "the nodes of the network are the documents ( webpages ) and the edges are the hyperlinks ( urls ) that point from one document to another ( see fig [ fig_illust ] ) .",
    "the size of this network was close to @xmath15 billion nodes at the end of 1999 ( lawrence and giles 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "the interest in the www as a network has boomed after it has been discovered that the degree distribution of the webpages follows a power - law over several orders of magnitude ( albert , jeong , barabsi 1999 , kumar_et al .",
    "since the edges of the www are directed , the network is characterized by two degree distributions : the distribution of outgoing edges , @xmath16 , signifies the probability that a document has @xmath11 outgoing hyperlinks and the distribution of incoming edges , @xmath17 , is the probability that @xmath11 hyperlinks point to a certain document .",
    "several studies have established that both @xmath16 and @xmath17 have power - law tails : @xmath18    albert , jeong and barabsi ( 1999 ) have studied a subset of the www containing @xmath19 nodes and have found @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",

    "adamic and huberman ( 2000 ) used a somewhat different representation of the www , each node representing a separate domain name and two nodes being connected if any of the pages in one domain linked to any page in the other . while this method lumps together often thousands of pages that are on the same domain , representing a nontrivial aggregation of the nodes , the distribution of incoming edges still followed a power - law with @xmath26 .",
    "note that @xmath27 is the same for all measurements at the document level despite the two years time delay between the first and last web crawl , during which the www had grown at least five times larger . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath28 has an increasing tendency with the sample size or time ( see table [ table_gamma ] ) .    despite the large number of nodes",
    ", the www displays the small world property .",
    "this was first reported by albert , jeong and barabsi ( 1999 ) , who found that the average path length for a sample of @xmath19 nodes was @xmath29 and predicted , using finite size scaling , that for the full www of @xmath30 million nodes that would be around @xmath31 .",
    "subsequent measurements of broder _ et al . _ ( 2000 ) found that the average path length between nodes in a @xmath24 million sample of the www is @xmath32 , in agreement with the finite size prediction for a sample of this size .",
    "finally , the domain level network displays an average path length of @xmath33 ( adamic 1999 ) .",
    "the directed nature of the www does not allow us to measure the clustering coefficient using eq .",
    "( [ eq_clust_coeff ] ) .",
    "one way to avoid this difficulty is to make the network undirected , making each edge bidirectional .",
    "this was the path followed by adamic ( 1999 ) who studied the www at the domain level using an 1997 alexa crawl of @xmath34 million webpages distributed between @xmath35 sites .",
    "adamic removed the nodes which have only one edge , focusing on a network of @xmath36 sites .",
    "while these modifications are expected to increase somewhat the clustering coefficient , she found @xmath37 , orders of magnitude higher than @xmath38 corresponding to a random graph of the same size and average degree .",
    "the internet is the network of the physical links between computers and other telecommunication devices ( fig .",

    "the topology of the internet is studied at two different levels . at the router level",
    "the nodes are the routers , and edges are the physical connections between them . at the interdomain ( or autonomous system ) level each domain , composed of hundreds of routers and computers , is represented by a single node , and an edge is drawn between two domains if there is at least one route that connects them .",
    "( 1999 ) have studied the internet at both levels , concluding that in each case the degree distribution follows a power - law .",

    "while the condensation phenomenon appears to be similar to the gelation process observed by krapivsky , redner and leyvraz ( 2000a ) superlinear preferential attachment , it is not clear at this point if this similarity is purely accidental or there is a deeper connection between the fitness model and the fitness - free superlinear model .",
    "many complex systems display a surprising degree of tolerance against errors .",

    "the stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of their underlying network structure .",
    "but could the network topology , beyond redundancy , play a role in the error tolerance of such complex systems ?",
    "while error tolerance and robustness almost always has a dynamical component , here we will focus only on the topological aspects of robustness , caused by edge and/or node removal .",
    "the first results regarding network reliability under _ edge removal _ came from random graph theory ( moore and shannon 1956a , b , margulis 1974 and bollobs 1985 ) .",
    "consider an arbitrary connected graph @xmath162 of @xmath0 nodes , and assume that a @xmath1 fraction of the edges have been removed .",

    "this phenomenon is in fact an inverse bond percolation problem defined on a graph , with the slight difference ( already encountered in the evolution of a random graph ) that the critical probability depends on @xmath0 .    as the removal of a node implies the malfunctioning of all of its edges as well , _",
    "node removal _ inflicts more damage than edge removal .",
    "does a threshold phenomenon appear for node removal too ? and to what degree does the topology of the network determine the network s robustness ?",
    "in the following we will call a network error tolerant ( or robust ) if it contains a giant cluster comprised of most of the nodes even after a fraction of its nodes are removed .",
    "the results indicate a strong correlation between robustness and network topology .",
    "in particular , scale - free networks are more robust than random networks against random node failures , but are more vulnerable when the most connected nodes are targeted .      to compare the robustness of the erds - rnyi random graph and the scale - free model , albert , jeong and barabsi ( 2000 ) investigated networks that have the same number of nodes and edges , differing only in the degree distribution .",
    "two types of node removal were considered .",
    "random perturbations can cause the failure of some nodes , thus the first mechanism studied was the _ removal of randomly selected nodes_. the second mechanism , in which _",
    "the most highly connected nodes are removed _ at each step , was selected because it is the most damaging to the integrity of the system .",
    "this second choice emulates an intentional attack on the network .",
    "let us start from a connected network , and at each timestep remove a node .",
    "the disappearance of the node implies the removal of all edges that connect it to it , disrupting some of the paths between the remaining nodes .",
    "one way to monitor the disruption of an initially connected network is to study the relative size of the largest cluster that remains connected , @xmath166 , and the average path length @xmath106 of this cluster , in function of the fraction @xmath167 of the nodes removed from the system .",
    "we expect that the size of the largest cluster decreases and its average path length increases as an increasing number of nodes are removed from the network .",
    "we start by investigating the response of a random network to the random removal of its nodes ( see fig . [ error_num]a , squares ) , looking at the changes in the relative size of the largest cluster , @xmath166 ( i.e. the fraction of nodes contained in the largest cluster ) , and its average path length , @xmath106 , as an increasing number of nodes are randomly removed .    _ the size of the largest cluster : _ as expected , for a random network @xmath166 decreases from @xmath168 as @xmath167 increases .",

    "the general breakdown scenario follows again an inverse percolation transition , but now the critical fraction is much lower than in the random case .",
    "this is understandable , since at every step the highest possible number of edges are removed from the system .",
    "again , the two network topologies respond differently to attacks ( fig .",
    "[ error_num ] , circles ) : the scale - free network , due to its reliance on the highly connected nodes , breaks down earlier than the random network .    in conclusion , the numerical simulations indicate that scale - free networks display a topological robustness against random node failures .",
    "the origin of this error tolerance lies in their heterogeneous topology : low degree nodes are far more abundant than nodes with high degree , thus random node selection will more likely affect the nodes that play a marginal role in the overall network topology .",

    "third , when simulating an attack on the www , the nodes with the highest number of outgoing edges were removed , since @xmath252 can be readily obtained by looking on a web document , while @xmath253 can be only determined when the map of the whole web is available . despite these methodological differences , the response of the www is similar to the undirected networks : after a slight initial increase , @xmath106 remains constant in the case of random failures ( fig .",

    "[ sect_real_data ] to the removal of species ( nodes ) ( montoya and sol 2000 ) .",
    "the authors measure the relative size @xmath166 of the largest cluster , the average size @xmath257 of the rest of the species clusters , and the fraction of species becoming isolated due to removal of other species on whom their survival depends ( secondary extinctions ) .",
    "the results indicate that under random species removal the fraction of species contained in the largest cluster decreases linearly . in the same time",
    "the values of @xmath257 remain @xmath123 or @xmath15 , and the secondary extinction rates remain very low ( smaller than @xmath258 ) even when a high fraction of the nodes is removed .",
    "the estimate of eq .",
    "( [ crit_frac ] ) for the critical fraction at which the network fragments gives @xmath259 values around @xmath260 for all networks , indicating that these networks are error tolerant .",
    "however , when the most connected ( keystone ) species are successively removed , @xmath166 decays quickly and becomes zero at @xmath261 , while @xmath257 peaks .",
    "the secondary extinctions increase dramatically , reaching @xmath15 at relatively low values of @xmath167 ( @xmath262 for the silwood park web ) .",
    "the results presented in this section offer a simple but compelling picture : scale - free networks display a high degree of robustness against random errors , coupled with a susceptibility to attacks .",
    "this double feature is the result of the heterogeneity of the network topology , encoded by the power - law degree distribution .",
    "while we focused on two measures only , @xmath166 and @xmath106 , it is likely that most network measures will show distinct behavior for scale - free and random networks .",
    "the type of disturbances we considered were static , that is , the removal of a node affected other nodes only in the topological sense . on the other hand , in many networks",
    "there is a dynamical aspect to error tolerance : the removal of a node could affect the functionality of other nodes as well .",
    "for example , the removal of a highly connected router on the internet will redirect traffic to other routers that may not have the capacity to handle the increased traffic , creating an effective denial of service attack .",
    "thus in many systems errors lead to cascading failures , affecting a large fraction of the network .",
    "while little is known about such events , watts ( 2001 ) has recently shown that the network topology makes a big difference under cascading failures as well .",
    "he investigated a binary model in which the state of a node changes from off to on if a threshold fraction of its neighbors are on . in this model",
    "the probability that a perturbation in an initially all - off state spreads to the entire network can be connected to the existence of a giant cluster of vulnerable nodes . using the method of generating functions , watts ( 2001 ) showed that scale - free random graphs are much less vulnerable to random perturbations than erds - rnyi random graphs with the same average degree .",
    "it is often assumed that the robustness of many complex systems is rooted in their redundancy , which for networks represents the existence of many alternative paths that can preserve communication between nodes even if some nodes are absent .",
    "we are not aware of any research that would attempt to address this issue in quantitative terms , uncovering to which degree does redundancy play a role .",
    "just like its main subject , the field of complex networks is rapidly evolving .",
    "while the potential for new and important discoveries is high , it has attained a degree of coherence that made a review necessary and appropriate .",
    "the fact that the obtained results have reached a critical mass is best illustrated by the amount of work that we had no space to review above .",
    "being forced to make a choice , we focused on the mechanisms and models that describe network topology . in the following",
    "we briefly discuss the results that could not fit in this approach , but are important for the field . in many ways",
    "the list is as prominent as the works covered so far .",
    "most networks offer a support for various dynamical processes , as often the topology plays a crucial role in determining the system s dynamical features .",
    "the range of possible dynamical processes is wide .",
    "watts ( 1999 ) studied the impact of clustering on several processes , including games , cooperation , the prisoner s dilemma , cellular automata and synchronization ( see also lago - fernndez _ et al .",
    "wang and chen ( 2001 ) have shown that inhomogeneous scale - free topology plays an important role in determining synchronization on a complex network , but search and random walks on complex networks is also a much investigated topic ( huberman _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , kleinberg 2000 , adamic _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 , burda _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 , walsh 2001 , bilke and peterson 2001 ) .",
    "modeling dynamics on a fixed topology is legitimate when the timescales describing the network topology and the dynamics on the network differ widely .",
    "a good example is internet traffic , whose modeling requires time resolutions from milliseconds up to a day ( willinger _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 , crovella and bestavros 1997 , sol and valverde 2001 ) , compared with the months required for significant topological changes .",
    "similarly , within the cell the concentrations of different chemicals change much faster than the cellular network topology ( schilling and palsson 1998 , savageau 1998 , gardner _",
    "_ 2000 , elowitz and leibler 2000 ) , which is shaped by evolution over many generations .",
    "the network structure plays a crucial role in determining the spread of ideas , innovations or computer viruses ( coleman , menzel and katz 1957 , valente 1995 ) . in this light , spreading and diffusion has been studied both on regular ( kauffman 1992 , keeling 1999 ) , random ( solomonoff , rapoport 1951 , rapoport 1957 , weigt and hartmann 2001 ) , small - world ( abramson and kuperman 2000 , newman and watts 1999 , moukarzel 1999 , newman , moore , watts 2000 , moore and newman 2000a , b ) and scale - free ( johansen and sornette 2000 , watts 2001 , bilke and peterson 2001 , tadi 2001b ) networks .",
    "a particularly surprising result was offered recently by pastor - satorras and vespignani ( 2001a , b ) , who studied the effect of the network topology on disease spreading .",
    "they show that while for random networks a local infection spreads to the whole network only if the spreading rate is larger than a critical value @xmath263 , for scale - free networks any spreading rate leads to the infection of the whole network .",
    "that is , for scale - free networks the critical spreading rate reduces to zero , a highly unexpected result that goes against volumes of results written on this topic .    when the timescales governing the dynamics on the network are comparable to that characterizing the network assembly , the dynamical processes can influence the topological evolution .",
    "this appears to be the case in various biological models inspired by the evolution of communities or the emergence of the cellular topology ( slanina and kotrla 1999 , 2000 , bornholdt and sneppen 2000 , jain and krishna 2001 , lssig _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) . in the current models",
    "often these systems are not allowed to `` grow '' , but they exist in a stationary state that gives room for diverse network topologies ( slanina and kotrla 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "interestingly , these models do not lead to scale - free networks in the stationary state , while it is known that cellular networks are scale - free ( jeong _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 , 2001 , wagner and fell 2000 ) .",
    "thus it is an open challenge to design evolutionary models that , based on selection or optimization mechanisms , could produce topologies similar to those seen in the real world .    in general , when it comes to understanding dynamics on networks , as well as the coupling between the dynamics and network assembly , we are only at the beginning of a promising journey ( strogatz 2001 ) .",
    "so far we are missing simple organizing principles that would match the coherence and universality characterizing network topology . due to the importance of the problem , and the rapid advances we witnessed in descibing network topology",
    ", we foresee it as being a rapidly growing area .",
    "many important networks , including the www or metabolic networks , have directed edges . in directed networks",
    ", however , not all nodes can be reached from a given node .",
    "this leads to a fragmented cluster structure , where the clusters are not unique , but they depend on the starting point of the inquiry . beyond some general aspects ,",
    "little is known about such directed networks , but important insights could emerge in the near future .",
    "a promising step in this direction is the empirical study of the cluster structure of the world - wide web ( broder _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) , finding that the www can be partitioned into several qualitatively different domains .",
    "the results indicate that @xmath264 of the nodes are part of the strongly connected component ( scc ) , in which any pair of nodes is connected by paths in either direction .",
    "another @xmath265 of the nodes can be reached from the scc , but can not connect to it in the other direction , while a roughly equal fraction of the nodes have paths leading to the scc but can not be reached from it . as several groups have pointed out , this structure is not specific to the www , but common to all directed networks , ranging from the cell metabolism to citation networks ( newman , strogatz and watts 2000 , dorogovtsev , mendes and samukhin 2001 ) .",
    "most network models ( including small world and evolving networks ) ignore the network s directedness . on the other hand ,",
    "as the www measurements have shown , the incoming and outgoing edges could follow different scaling laws . in this respect",
    ", the scale - free model ( barabsi and albert 1999 ) explains only the incoming degree distribution , as , due to its construction , each node has exactly @xmath195 outgoing edges , thus the outgoing degree distribution is a delta function ( sect .",
    "[ sect_sf_mod ] ) .",
    "while recently several models have investigated directed evolving networks , obtaining a power - law for both the outgoing and incoming edges ( tadi 2001a , b , krapivsky , rodgers , redner 2001 ) , the generic features of such complex directed models could hold further surprises .",
    "many real networks are weighted networks , in contrast with the binary networks investigated so far , where the edge weights can have only two values @xmath123 and @xmath15 ( absent or present ) .",
    "indeed , in social networks it is often important to assign a strength to each acquaintance edge , indicating how well the two individuals know each other ( newman 2001b , c ) .",
    "similarly , cellular networks are characterized by reaction rates , and the edges on the internet by bandwidth . what are the mechanisms that determine these weights ?",
    "do they obey nontrivial scaling behavior ?",
    "to what degree are they determined by the network topology ?",
    "most answers to these questions come from two directions : theoretical biology and ecology , concerned with issues related to allometric scaling , and random resistor networks ( derrida and vannimenus 1982 , duxbury , beale and moukarzel 1995 ) , a topic much studied in statistical mechanics .",
    "allometric scaling describes the transport of material through the underlying network characterizing various biological systems .",
    "most of these systems have a branching tree - like topology . the combination of the tree topology with the desire to minimize the cost of transportation leads to nontrivial scaling in the weights of the edges ( west _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 , enquist _",
    "_ 1998 , 1999 ) .    in a more general context , banavar and",
    "collaborators have shown that when the aim is to minimize the cost of transportation , the optimal network topology can vary widely , ranging from tree - like structures to spirals or loop - dominated highly interconnected networks ( banavar _ at al .",
    "_ 1999 , 2000 ) . beyond giving systematic methods and principles to predict the topology of transportation networks",
    ", these studies raise some important questions that need to be addressed in the future .",
    "for example , to which degree is the network topology shaped by global optimization , or the local processes seen in scale - free networks ?",
    "there are fundamental differences between transportation and evolving networks . in transportation models",
    "the network topology is determined by a global optimization process , in which edges are positioned to minimize , over the whole network , some predefined quantity , such as cost or energy of transportation .",
    "in contrast , for evolving networks such global optimization is absent , as the decision where to link is delegated to the node level .",
    "however , this decision is not entirely local in scale - free networks either , as the node has information about the degree of all nodes in the network , from which it chooses one following ( [ pi ] ) , the normalization factor in making the system fully coupled .",
    "the interplay between such local and global optimization processes is far from being fully understood ( carlson and doyle 1999 , 2000 , doyle and carlson 2000 ) .",
    "while edge weights are well understood for trees and some much studied physical networks , ranging from river networks ( rodrguez - iturbe and rinaldo 1997 , banavar _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) to random resistor networks ( derrida and vannimenus 1982 , duxbury , beale and moukarzel 1995 ) , little work is done on these problems in the case of small world or scale - free networks .",
    "recently yook _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) have investigated an evolving network model in which the weights were added dynamically , resulting in unexpected scaling behavior .",
    "newman ( 2001b ) has also assigned weights to characterize the collaboration strength between scientists .",
    "these studies make an important point , however : despite the practical relevance and potential phenomenological richness , the understanding of weighted networks is still in its infancy .      a few real networks , with high technological or intellectual importance , have received special attention . in these studies",
    "the goal is to develop models that go beyond the basic growth mechanisms and incorporate the specific and often unique details of a given system . along these lines",
    "much attention has focused on developing realistic world - wide web models that explain everything from the average path length to incoming and outgoing degree distribution ( adamic , huberman 1999 , flake _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 , tadi 2001a , krapivsky , rodgers , redner 2001 ) .",
    "many studies focus on the identification of web communities as well , representing clusters of nodes that are highly connected to each other ( gibson _ et al .",

    "there is a race in computer science to create good internet topology generators ( paxson , floyd 1997 , comellas _",
    "et al . _ 2000 ) .",
    "new internet protocols are tested on model networks before their implementation , and protocol optimization is sensitive to the underlying network topology ( labovitz _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) . prompted by the discovery that the internet is a scale - free network , all topology generators are being reviewed and redesigned .",
    "these studies have resulted in careful investigations into what processes could contribute to the correct topology , reaffirming that growth and preferential attachment are necessary conditions for realistic internet models ( medina _ et al .",

    "the high interest in scale - free networks might give the impression that all complex networks in nature have power - law degree distributions . as we discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect_real_data ] , that is far from being the case .",
    "it is true that several complex networks of high interest for the scientific community , such as the www , cellular networks , internet , some social networks and the citation network are scale - free .",
    "however , others like the power grid or the neural network of _ c. elegans _ appear to be exponential .",
    "does that mean that they are random ?",
    "far from it .",
    "these systems are also best described by evolving networks . as we have seen in many examples in sect .",
    "[ sect_evol ] , evolving networks can develop both power - law and exponential degree distributions .",
    "while the power - law regime appears to be robust , sublinear preferential attachment , aging effects , growth constraints lead to crossovers to exponential decay .",
    "thus , while evolving networks are rather successful at describing a wide range of networks , the functional form of @xmath10 can not be guessed until the microscopic details of the network evolution are fully understood .",
    "if all processes shaping the topology of a certain network are properly incorporated , the resulting @xmath10 often has a rather complex form , described by a combination of power - laws and exponentials .",
    "in critical phenomena we are accustomed to unique scaling exponents that characterize complex systems .",
    "indeed , the critical exponents are uniquely determined by robust factors , such as the dimension of the space or conservation laws ( stanley 1971 , ma 1976 , hohenberg and halperin 1977 ) .",
    "the most studied exponents in terms of evolving networks are the dynamic exponent , @xmath158 and the degree exponent @xmath126 . while the former characterizes the network dynamics , the latter is a measure of the network topology .",
    "the inseparability of the topology and the dynamics of evolving networks is shown by the fact that these exponents are related by the scaling relation ( [ beta_gamma ] ) ( dorogovtsev , mendes , samukhin 2000a ) , underlying the fact that the network assembly uniquely determines the network topology .",
    "however , in no case are these exponents unique .",
    "they can be tuned continuously by such parameters as the frequency of internal edges , rewiring rates , initial node attractiveness and so on . while it is difficult to search for universality in the value of the exponents",
    ", this does not imply that the exponents are not uniquely defined .",
    "indeed , if all processes contributing to the network assembly and evolution are known , the exponents can be calculated exactly .",
    "but they do not take up the discrete values we are accustomed to in critical phenomena .",
    "some real networks have an underlying bipartite structure ( sect .",
    "[ sect_ccoeff_nws ] ) .",
    "for example , the actor network can be represented as a graph consisting of two types of nodes : actors and movies , the edges always connecting two nodes of different type .",
    "these networks can be described as generalized random graphs ( newman , strogatz and watts 2000 ) .",
    "it is important to note , however , that both subsets of these bipartite graphs are growing in time .",
    "while it has not been attempted yet , the theoretical methods developed for evolving networks can be generalized for bipartite networks as well , leading to coupled continuum equations .",
    "we expect that extending these methods , whenever appropriate , would lead to a much more realistic description of several real systems .",
    "the classical thinking of complex networks , rooted in percolation and random graph theory ( see aldous 1999 ) , is that they appear as a result of a percolation process in which isolated nodes eventually join a giant cluster as the number of edges increases between them .",
    "thus a much studied question concerns the threshold at which the giant cluster appears . with a few exceptions ( callaway _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) , evolving networks do not follow this percolation picture , since they are connected from their construction .",
    "naturally , if node or edge removal is allowed , percolation - type questions do emerge ( sect .",
    "[ sect_error_attack ] ) .",
    "the shift that we experienced in the past three years in our understanding networks was rather swift and unexpected .",
    "we have learned through empirical studies , models and analytic approaches that real networks are far from being random , but display generic organizing principles shared by rather different systems .",
    "these advances have created a prolific branch of statistical mechanics , followed with equal interest by sociologists , biologists and computer scientists .",
    "our goal here was to summarize , in a coherent fashion , what is known so far .",
    "yet , we believe that these results are only the tip of the iceberg . we have uncovered some generic topological and dynamical principles , but the answers to the open questions could hide new concepts and ideas that might turn out to be equally exciting as those we encountered so far . the future could bring a new infusion of tools as well , as the recent import of ideas from field theory ( burda _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) and quantum statistics ( bianconi 2000a , bianconi and barabsi 2000 , zizzi 2001 ) indicate . consequently , this article is intended to be as much a review a catalyst for further advances .",

    "<S> while traditionally these systems were modeled as random graphs , it is increasingly recognized that the topology and evolution of real networks is governed by robust organizing principles . here </S>",
    "<S> we review the recent advances in the field of complex networks , focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> after reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks , we discuss the main models and analytical tools , covering random graphs , small - world and scale - free networks , as well as the interplay between topology and the network s robustness against failures and attacks .    2 </S>"
