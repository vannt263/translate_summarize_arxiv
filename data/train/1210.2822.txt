    "magnetically frustrated systems entail a pattern of interactions that can not be satisfied simultaneously.@xcite these patterns typically involve equivalent antiferromagnetic ( afm ) interactions arranged in closed loops with an odd number of bonds , as in a pentagon or in a triangle .",
    "as one moves around the loop , the spin flips on each bond , and the translation symmetry is violated because the full turn around the loop leads to the inverted spin direction .",
    "therefore , in frustrated systems spins can not develop a simple collinear afm order , instead more complex magnetic ground states appear.@xcite finding appropriate model systems for experimental studies of frustrated magnetism is a long - standing challenge.@xcite the availability of model systems is crucial for addressing theoretical problems and raising new questions to theoretical as well as experimental research .",
    "the loops with an odd number of bonds are typically triangular .",
    "planar triangular spin lattices have been widely studied @xcite in at attempt to achieve a spin - liquid state that lacks long - range magnetic order down to zero temperature . when triangles form corner - sharing tetrahedra instead of tiling the plane , the system enters a so - called spin - ice state that facilitates experimental access to magnetic monopoles.@xcite thanks to a different topology , spin lattices based on pentagons could lead to a range of hitherto unexplored properties and ground states .",
    "however , experimental and even theoretical considerations of such lattices remain challenging because the five - fold symmetry of an ideal pentagon excludes the periodicity of the lattice .",
    "pentagonal units do not form a regular tiling in the plane . to build a tiling",
    ", the pentagons have to be distorted and should , unlike the triangles , involve non - equivalent bonds .",
    "one of the least - perimeter tilings allowed for pentagons is known as the cairo lattice .",
    "it entails the coupling @xmath10 between three - vertex sites , and the coupling @xmath11 running from each three - vertex site to the surrounding four - vertex sites ( fig .",
    "[ lattice ] ) .",
    "recent theoretical work puts forward a number of unconventional ground states , including spin nematics , and other interesting properties of the cairo spin lattice.@xcite these predictions remain highly challenging for experimental verification . in crystals ,",
    "the pentagonal arrangement of magnetic ions is very rare , which is partly related to the fact that periodic crystals can not have five - fold symmetry .",
    "presently , the only known material prototype of the cairo lattice is bi@xmath4fe@xmath0o@xmath12 having mullite - type crystal structure.@xcite     ( color online ) cairo pentagonal lattice ( left panel ) and its derivative version in bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f ( right panel ) .",
    "note that the ideal lattice comprises only two couplings , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , whereas in bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f @xmath11 splits into @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "additionally , the couplings @xmath15 and @xmath16 along the @xmath17 direction are present . ]",
    "while theory readily spans the broad range of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 parameters,@xcite bi@xmath4fe@xmath0o@xmath12 represents a single point on the effective @xmath10-@xmath11 diagram.@xcite experimental access to the diverse magnetism of the cairo lattice requires a range of compounds with different @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in the present paper , we demonstrate that a deliberate modification of the sillimanite - type ( al@xmath4sio@xmath1 ) structure may lead to interesting materials showing exotic magnetism of the cairo spin lattice .",
    "specifically , we report the crystal structure and magnetic behavior of the hitherto unknown oxyfluoride bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f that undergoes a sequence of intricate magnetic transitions and reveals unconventional magnetism pertaining to the pentagonal arrangement of magnetic ions in a crystal .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     monte - carlo simulations for the spin lattice depicted in fig .",
    "[ lattice]b and the @xmath18 parameters from table  [ integrals ] suggest that at low temperatures bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f should be magnetically ordered .",
    "the ordering pattern can be extracted from the spin - spin correlations ( table  [ integrals ] ) , as explained in ref .  .",
    "the normalized correlation @xmath19 is the measure of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the angle between the magnetic moments .",
    "negative normalized correlations approaching @xmath22 indicate antiparallel magnetic moments within the fe@xmath4o@xmath5 dimers ( the interaction @xmath23 ) as well as between fe1 and fe3 along the @xmath17 direction ( the interaction @xmath16 ) . despite the sizable afm coupling @xmath15 between the adjacent fe1 sites along @xmath17 , the moments on these fe1 sites are parallel , as shown by the positive spin - spin correlation of nearly + 1 ( table  [ integrals ] ) . in this way",
    ", the simulations identify the ferrimagnetic order within the rutile - like chains , in agreement with the experiment .",
    "following the expectations , the spin lattice of bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f features pentagonal units with exclusively afm interactions ( fig .",
    "[ lattice]b ) that lead to a strong magnetic frustration .",
    "indeed , in the ground - state magnetic structure only the strongest coupling @xmath23 is fully satisfied .",
    "the moments coupled by @xmath13 and @xmath14 develop the non - collinear configuration , whereas the afm coupling @xmath15 is fully suppressed and gives way to the fm order .",
    "the coupling @xmath16 is also fully satisfied , because it does not compete with any other interaction in this system .",
    "our experimental and theoretical results establish the strong magnetic frustration in bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f .",
    "this effect originates from the pentagonal units of the spin lattice .",
    "the frustration underlies the intricate non - collinear magnetic structure and the overall peculiar magnetic behavior with the magnetic ordering at @xmath9 and further transformations at @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "similar to bi@xmath4fe@xmath0o@xmath12 , bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f is not a perfect prototype of the cairo spin lattice ( fig .",
    "[ lattice ] ) . in bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f ,",
    "two nonequivalent couplings @xmath13 and @xmath14 stand for the single coupling @xmath11 .",
    "additionally , the lattice is decorated by fe1 dumbbells that replace all four - vertex sites . however",
    ", this kind of decoration does not change any basic features of the magnetic system .",
    "the spin lattices of bi@xmath4fe@xmath0o@xmath12 and bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f are topologically equivalent to the cairo lattice .",
    "the non - collinear magnetic structures observed in these compounds follow theoretical predictions for the ideal cairo lattice.@xcite    two striking differences between bi@xmath4fe@xmath0o@xmath12 and bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f should be emphasized , though . experimentally , bi@xmath4fe@xmath0o@xmath12 orders antiferromagnetically below 264  k and retains the same magnetic structure down to the lowest temperatures .",
    "this can be seen from the smooth temperature evolution of the magnetic reflections.@xcite in bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f , the afm ordering that sets in below @xmath24  k is likely incomplete and changes upon further magnetic transitions at @xmath7 and @xmath8 . as none of these transitions",
    "is accompanied by any structural transformations detectable by npd and sxpd , the sizable release of entropy and the indications for a weak first - order contribution imply that above @xmath7 the magnetic order in bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f is altered .",
    "one plausible explanation is the formation of partially disordered afm states that have higher entropy than the fully ordered non - collinear afm structure .",
    "the partially disordered states are found in magnetic models based on triangular spin lattices.@xcite they are indeed observed in co@xmath25 halides , such as cscocl@xmath26@xcite and rbcobr@xmath26.@xcite surprisingly , our experimental results may put forward similar physics on the pentagonal lattice .",
    "our results also rise further questions to theory , because the sequence of magnetic transitions below the nel temperature was never anticipated for any pentagonal geometry .",
    "the second difference between bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f and bi@xmath4fe@xmath0o@xmath12 pertains to the stacking of the pentagonal layers . while in bi@xmath4fe@xmath0o@xmath12",
    "these layers are directly stacked on top of each other , bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f features additional fe3 sites between the pentagonal layers .",
    "the formation of these additional sites accompanies the incorporation of the bi@xmath0f tetrahedra .",
    "indeed , a comparison between the crystal structures of bi@xmath4fe@xmath0o@xmath12 , bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f , and sillimanite al@xmath4sio@xmath1 ( the aristotype structure for the mullite - type compounds@xcite ) opens broad perspectives for finding new systems with a pentagonal arrangement of magnetic atoms .",
    "all these structures contain infinite rutile - type chains of octahedra and differ by the connectivity of the chains through the b@xmath4o@xmath5 tetrahedral groups . in the al@xmath4sio@xmath1",
    "(= b@xmath26o@xmath1 ) sillimanite structure , the connectivity is the densest : every bo@xmath3 octahedron shares a corner with the tetrahedral group ( fig .",
    "[ homologous ] ) . in the bi@xmath4fe@xmath0o@xmath12 structure",
    ", the linkages are repeated at every second octahedron , whereas in bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f every third octahedron is linked .",
    "the series of the al@xmath4sio@xmath1 , bi@xmath4fe@xmath0o@xmath12 , and bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f compounds can be formally considered as an insertion of a@xmath4bo@xmath0 fragments between the tetrahedral linkages .",
    "the a@xmath4bo@xmath0 entity includes two atomic layers , a@xmath4o@xmath4 and bo@xmath4 , and increases the distance between the tetrahedral linkages .",
    "additionally , two a - cations located between the chains appear .",
    "this way , one arrives at the sillimanite - based homologous series b@xmath26o@xmath1 + @xmath27a@xmath4bo@xmath0 , where @xmath28 corresponds to the sillimanite structure , @xmath29 comprises a group of bi@xmath4fe@xmath0o@xmath12 ( b = fe , al , ga ) compounds@xcite and @xmath27 = 2 is represented by bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2(f ) , where the extra f atom is added between two a@xmath4o@xmath4 layers . extending this series to @xmath30 ,",
    "one arrives at the a@xmath4bo@xmath0 structure , where tetrahedral linkages between the rutile - type chains are absent .",
    "this structure is exemplified by sb@xmath4bo@xmath0 ( b = mn , fe , ni)@xcite belonging to the pb@xmath26o@xmath0 structure type .",
    "( color online ) the scheme of the linkage between rutile - type octahedral chains ( blue ) through the tetrahedral units ( yellow ) in the b@xmath26o@xmath1 + @xmath27a@xmath4bo@xmath0 homologous series for different @xmath27 .",
    "the a cations are shown as orange spheres . ]",
    "the above crystallographic arguments suggest that other members of the homologous series should be formed in between the limiting cases of b@xmath26o@xmath1 ( @xmath28 ) and a@xmath4bo@xmath0 ( @xmath30 ) . indeed",
    ", the @xmath29 ( bi@xmath4fe@xmath0o@xmath12 ) and @xmath31 ( bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f ) members are already available .",
    "the intermediate compounds would contain pentagonal - lattice units in the @xmath32 plane connected via intermediate b sites along the @xmath17 direction . while bi@xmath4fe@xmath0o@xmath12 shows a single magnetic transition",
    ", bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f reveals a more intricate and peculiar physics with several transitions that can be retained or probably altered in further members of the family with higher @xmath27 .",
    "this approach also enables the control over the dimensionality , because the separation between the pentagonal layers increases with @xmath27 .",
    "the compounds with high @xmath27 require appropriate a cations .",
    "considering the available bi@xmath4fe@xmath0o@xmath12 and bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f compositions , the lone electron pair is likely a necessary prerequisite . besides bi@xmath6 , sb@xmath6 and pb@xmath25",
    "are plausible candidates because of their known compatibility with the a@xmath4bo@xmath0 structure.@xcite the combination of bi@xmath6 , sb@xmath6 and pb@xmath25 enables heterovalent replacements and the fine tuning of the electron concentration .",
    "another interesting feature is the ability to accommodate extra anions .",
    "the f@xmath33 anions can be inserted into tetrahedral voids formed between two successive a@xmath4o@xmath4 layers , as in the @xmath31 bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f structure that has the a@xmath0b@xmath1o@xmath2f composition instead of the expected a@xmath0b@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "alternatively , the anion content can be changed by replacing the common vertex of two feo@xmath0 tetrahedra with an oxygen dumbbell that would transform a pair of corner - sharing tetrahedra into a pair of edge - sharing tetragonal pyramids b@xmath4o@xmath34 .",
    "this replacement is observed in the mn - based version of the @xmath29 compound , bi@xmath4mn@xmath0o@xmath35 (= a@xmath4b@xmath0o@xmath12o).@xcite    in summary , the discovery of bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f not only provides an interesting material prototype of a frustrated cairo pentagonal lattice , but also opens tantalizing opportunities for a further expansion of this interesting class of materials . at low temperatures , bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f develops the non - collinear antiferromagnetic order , which is anticipated for the pentagonal cairo lattice .",
    "however , this order is strongly altered at @xmath36  k and @xmath37  k. the respective magnetic transitions have no detectable structural component .",
    "they also involve the sizable increase in the magnetic entropy that may be ascribed to the transformation toward partially ordered antiferromagnetic states extending up to the nel temperature of @xmath38  k. additionally , bi@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f manifests the b@xmath26o@xmath1 + @xmath27a@xmath4bo@xmath0 homologous series of compounds that form further examples of pentagonal spin lattices , thus facilitating a precise tuning of the `` dimensionality '' as well as electronic concentration in these systems .",
