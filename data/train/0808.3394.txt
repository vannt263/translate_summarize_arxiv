    "it is the purpose of this paper to study the existence and regularity of weak solutions of the following parabolic system , which is a generalization of the well - known keller - segel model @xcite of chemotaxis :    [ bbru_s1-s2-s3 ] @xmath1    where @xmath2 is a bounded domain with a sufficiently smooth boundary @xmath3 and outer unit normal  @xmath4 .",
    "equation   is _ doubly nonlinear _ , since we apply the @xmath0-laplacian diffusion operator , where we assume @xmath5 , to the integrated diffusion function @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a non - negative integrable function with support on the interval  @xmath8 $ ] .    in the biological phenomenon described by , the quantity @xmath9 is the density of organisms , such as bacteria or cells .",
    "the conservation pde incorporates two competing mechanisms , namely the density - dependent diffusive motion of the cells , described by the doubly nonlinear diffusion term , and a motion in response to and towards the gradient @xmath10 of the concentration @xmath11 of a substance called _",
    "chemoattractant_. the movement in response to @xmath10 also involves the density - dependent probability @xmath12 for a cell located at @xmath13 to find space in a neighboring location , and a constant @xmath14 describing chemotactic sensitivity . on the other hand ,",
    "the pde describes the diffusion of the chemoattractant , where @xmath15 is a diffusion constant and the function @xmath16 describes the rates of production and degradation of the chemoattractant ; we here adopt the common choice @xmath17    we assume that there exists a maximal population density of cells  @xmath18 such that @xmath19 .",
    "this corresponds to a switch to repulsion at high densities , known as prevention of overcrowding , volume - filling effect or density control ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it means that cells stop to accumulate at a given point of @xmath20 after their density attains a certain threshold value , and the chemotactic cross - diffusion term @xmath21 vanishes identically when @xmath22 .",
    "we also assume that the diffusion coefficient @xmath23 vanishes at @xmath24 and @xmath18 , so that degenerates for @xmath25 and @xmath26 , while @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "a typical example is @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "normalizing variables by @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , we have @xmath34 ; in the sequel we will omit tildes in the notation .",
    "the main intention of the present work is to address the question of the regularity of weak solutions , which is a delicate analytical issue since the structure of equation combines a degeneracy of @xmath0-laplacian type with a two - sided point degeneracy in the diffusive term .",
    "we prove the local hlder continuity of the weak solutions of using the method of intrinsic scaling ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the novelty lies in tackling the two types of degeneracy simultaneously and finding the right geometric setting for the concrete structure of the pde .",
    "the resulting analysis combines the technique used by urbano @xcite to study the case of a diffusion coefficient @xmath23 that decays like a power at both degeneracy points ( with @xmath35 ) with the technique by porzio and vespri @xcite to study the @xmath0-laplacian , with @xmath23 degenerating at only one side .",
    "we recover both results as particular cases of the one studied here . to our knowledge",
    ", the @xmath0-laplacian is a new ingredient in chemotaxis models , so we also include a few numerical examples that illustrate the behavior of solutions of for @xmath36 , compared with solutions to the standard case @xmath35 , but including nonlinear diffusion .      to put this paper in the proper perspective , we recall that the keller - segel model is a widely studied topic , see e.g. murray @xcite for a general background and horstmann @xcite for a fairly complete survey on the keller - segel model and the variants that have been proposed .",
    "nonlinear diffusion equations for biological populations that degenerate at least for @xmath25 were proposed in the 1970s by gurney and nisbet @xcite and gurtin and mccamy @xcite ; more recent works include those by witelski @xcite , dkhil @xcite , burger et al.@xcite and bendahmane et al .",
    "furthermore , well - posedness results for these kinds of models include , for example , the existence of radial solutions exhibiting chemotactic collapse @xcite , the local - in - time existence , uniqueness and positivity of classical solutions , and results on their blow - up behavior @xcite , and existence and uniqueness using the abstract theory developed in @xcite , see @xcite .",
    "burger et al .",
    "@xcite prove the global existence and uniqueness of the cauchy problem in @xmath37 for linear and nonlinear diffusion with prevention of overcrowding .",
    "the model proposed herein exhibits an even higher degree of nonlinearity , and offers further possibilities to describe chemotactic movement ; for example , one could imagine that the cells or bacteria are actually placed in a medium with a non - newtonian rheology .",

    ", we also mention that another effort to endow this model with a more general diffusion mechanism has recently been made by biler and wu @xcite , who consider fractional diffusion .",
    "various results on the hlder regularity of weak solutions to quasilinear parabolic systems are based on the work of dibenedetto @xcite ; the present article also contributes to this direction .",
