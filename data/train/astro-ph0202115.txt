    "optical interferometry provides physicists and astronomers with an exquisite set of probes of the micro and macrocosmos . from the laboratory to the observatory over the past few decades , there has been a surge of activity in developing new tools for ground - based optical astronomy , of which interferometry is one of the most powerful .",
    "an optical interferometer is a device that combines two or more light waves emitted from the same source at the same time to produce interference fringes .",
    "the implementation of interferometry in optical astronomy began more than a century ago with the work of fizeau ( 1868 ) .",
    "michelson and pease ( 1921 ) measured successfully the angular diameter of ( @xmath0  ori ) , using an interferometer based on two flat mirrors , which allowed them to measure the fringe visibility in the interference pattern formed by starlight at the detector plane .",
    "however , progress was hindered by the severe image degradation produced by atmospheric turbulence in the optical spectrum .",
    "the field remained dormant until the development of intensity interferometry by hanbury brown and twiss ( 1958 ) , a technique that employs two adjacent sets of mirrors and photoelectric correlation .",
    "turbulence and the concomitant development of thermal convection in the atmosphere distort the phase and amplitude of an incoming wavefront of starlight .",
    "the longer the path , the greater the degradation that the image suffers .",
    "light reaching the entrance pupil of an imaging system is coherent only within patches of diameters of order r@xmath1 , fried s parameter ( fried , 1966 ) .",
    "this limited coherence causes blurring of the image , blurring that is modeled by a convolution with the point - spread function ( psf ) . both the sharpness of astronomical images and the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio ( hence faintness of the objects that can be studied ) depend on angular resolution , the latter because noise comes from as much of the sky as is in the resolution element .",
    "thus reducing the beam width from , say , 1 arcsecond ( @xmath2 ) to 0.5@xmath2 reduces sky noise by a factor of 4 .",
    "two physical phenomena limit the minimum resolvable angle at optical and infrared ( ir ) wavelengths - diameter of the collecting area and turbulence in the atmosphere .",
    "the crossover between domination by aperture size ( @xmath3/aperture diameter ) and domination by atmospheric turbulence ( ` seeing ' ) occurs when the aperture becomes larger than the size of a characteristic turbulent element .",
    "the image of a star obtained through a large telescope looks ` speckled ' or grainy because different parts of the image are blurred by small areas of turbulence in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "labeyrie ( 1970 ) proposed speckle interferometry ( si ) , a process that deciphers the diffraction - limited fourier spectrum and image features of stellar objects by taking a large number of very - short - exposure images of the same field .",
    "computer assistance is then used to reconstruct from these many images a single image that is free of turbulent areas - in essence , an image of the object as it might appear from space .",
    "the success of speckle interferometry in measuring the diameters of stars encouraged astronomers to develop further image - processing techniques .",
    "these techniques are , for the most part , post - detection processes .",
    "recent advances in technology have produced the hardware to compensate for wave - front distortion in real time .",
    "adaptive optics ( ao ; babcock , 1953 ; rousset et al . ,",
    "1990 ) is based on this hardware - oriented approach , which sharpens telescope images blurred by the earth s atmosphere .",
    "it employs a combination of deformation of reflecting surfaces ( i.e. , flexible mirrors ) and post - detection image restoration ( roddier , 1999 ) .",
    "one of its most successful applications has been in imaging of neptune s ring arcs .",
    "adaptive optical imaging systems have been treated in depth by the review of roggemann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , which includes discussion of wavefront compensation devices , wavefront sensors , control systems , performance of ao systems , and representative experimental results .",
    "it also deals with the characterization of atmospheric turbulence , the si technique , and deconvolution techniques for wavefront sensing .",
    "long - baseline optical interferometry ( lboi ) uses two or more optical telescopes to synthesize the angular resolution of a much larger aperture ( aperture synthesis ) than would be possible with a single mirror .",
    "labeyrie ( 1975 ) extended the concept of speckle interferometry to a pair of telescopes in a north - south baseline configuration , and subsequently astronomers have created larger ground - based arrays .",
    "a few of these arrays , e.g. , the keck interferometer and the very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) , employ large telescopes fitted with ao systems .",
    "the combination of long - baseline interferometry , mimicking a wide aperture , and ao techniques to improve the images offers the best of both approaches and shows great promise for applications such as the search for extra - solar planets . at this point",
    "it seems clear that interferometry and ao are complementary , and neither can reach its full potential without the other .",
    "the present review addresses the aims , methods , scientific achievements , and future prospects of long - baseline interferometry ( lbi ) at optical and infrared wavelengths , carried out with two or more apertures separated by more than their own sizes . in order to embark on such a subject ,",
    "we first review the basic principles of interferometry and its applications , the theoretical aspects of si as a statistical analysis of a speckle pattern , and the limitations imposed by the atmosphere and the detectors on the performance of single - aperture diffraction - limited imaging . other related concerns , such as the relationship between image - plane techniques and pupil - plane interferometry , phase - closure methods , and dark speckle imaging , will also be treated .",
    "adaptive optics as a pre - detection compensation technique is described in brief , as are the strengths and weaknesses of pre and post detection .    the final part of this review deals with the applications of multiple - telescope interferometry to imaging , astrometry , and nulling .",
    "these applications entail specific problems having to do with delaylines , beam recombination , polarization , dispersion , fringe tracking , and the recovery of visibility functions .",
    "various image restoration techniques are discussed as well , with emphasis on the deconvolution methods used in aperture - synthesis mapping .",
    "astronomical sources emit incoherent light consisting of the random superposition of numerous successive short - lived waves sent out from many elementary emitters , and therefore , the optical coherence is related to the various forms of correlations of the random process . for a monochromatic wave field ,",
    "the amplitude of vibration at any point is constant and the phase varies linearly with time .",
    "conversely , the amplitude and phase in the case of quasi - monochromatic wave field , undergo irregular fluctuations ( born and wolf , 1984 ) .",
    "the rapidity of fluctuations depends on the light crossing time of the emitting region .",
    "interferometers based on ( i ) wavefront division ( young s experiment that is sensitive to the size and bandwidth of the source ) , ( ii ) amplitude division ( michelson s interferometer ) are generally used to measure spatial coherence and temporal coherence , respectively . in what follows ,",

    "typical ground - based observations with large telescopes in the visible wavelength range are made with a strehl ratio @xmath74 ( babcock , 1990 ) , while a diffraction - limited telescope would , by definition , have a strehl ratio of 1 .",
    "when two light beams from a single source are superposed , the intensity at the place of superposition varies from point to point between maxima , which exceed the sum of the intensities in the beams , and minima , which may be zero .",
    "this sum or difference is known as interference ; the correlated fluctuation can be partially or completely coherent ( born and wolf , 1984 ) .",

    "time variations of @xmath97 are statistical in nature ( mendel and wolf , 1995 ) .",
    "hence , one seeks a statistical description of the field ( correlations ) as the field is due to a partially coherent source . depending upon the correlations between the phasor amplitudes at different object points",
    ", one would expect a definite correlation between the two points of the field emitted by the object .",
    "the maximum and minimum intensity occur , when @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively . if @xmath100 , the intensity varies between 4@xmath23 , and 0 .    in the case of quasi - monochromatic wave , the analytical signal , @xmath101 , obtained at the observation point",

    "the modulus of the fringe visibility is estimated as the ratio of high frequency to low frequency energy in the average spectral density ; the visibility of fringes , @xmath132 , is estimated as ,    @xmath133      fizeau ( 1868 ) suggested that installing a screen with two holes in front of a telescope would allow measurements of stellar diameters with diffraction - limited resolution . in this set up , the beams are diffracted by the sub - apertures and the telescope acts as both collector and correlator .",
    "therefore , temporal coherence is automatically obtained due to the built - in zero opd . the spatial modulation frequency , as well as the required sampling of the image change with the separation of sub - apertures .",
    "the maximum resolution in this case depends on the separation between the sub - apertures ; the maximum spacings that can be explored are limited by the physical diameter of the telescope .",
    "the number of stellar sources for measuring diameters is also limited .",
    "one of the first significant results was the measurement of the diameter of the satellites of jupiter with a fizeau interferometer on the 40-inch yerkes refractor by michelson ( 1891 ) . with the 100-inch telescope on mt .",
    "wilson anderson ( 1920 ) determined the angular separation ( @xmath134 ) of spectroscopic binary star capella .",
    "results from the classical michelson interferometer were used to formulate special relativity .",
    "they are also being used in gravity - wave detection . gravitational radiation produced by coalescing binaries , or exploding stars , for example , changes the metric of spacetime .",
    "this effect causes a differential change of the path length of the arms of the interferometer , thereby introducing a phase - shift . today",
    ", there are several ground - based long baseline laser - interferometric detectors based on this principle under construction , and within the next several years these detectors should be in operation ( robertson , 2000 ) .",
    "the proposed laser interferometer space antenna , consisting of three satellites in formation about 50 million kilometers ( km ) above the earth in a heliocentric orbit , may detect gravitational waves by measuring fluctuations in the distances between test masses carried by the satellites .",
    "the essence of the michelson s stellar interferometer is to determine the covariance @xmath135 of the complex amplitudes @xmath136 , at two different points of the wavefronts .",
    "this interferometer was equipped with four flat mirrors that fold the beams by installing a 7-meter ( m ) steel beam on top of the mt .",
    "wilson 100-inch telescope .",
    "michelson and pease ( 1921 ) resolved the supergiant @xmath0  ori and a few other stars . in this case , the spatial modulation frequency in the focal - plane is independent of the distance between the collectors . in the fizeau mode ,",
    "the ratio of aperture diameter / separation is constant from light collection to recombination in the image - plane ( homothetic pupil ) . in the michelson mode ,",
    "this ratio is not constant since the collimated beams have the same diameter from the output of the telescope to the recombination lens .",
    "the distance between pupils is equal to the baseline at the collection mirrors ( the resolution is limited by the baseline ) and to a much smaller value just before the recombination lens .",
    "the disadvantage of the michelson mode is a very narrow field of view compared to the fizeau mode .",
    "unfortunately the project was abandoned due to various difficulties , including ( i ) effect of atmospheric turbulence , ( ii ) variations of refractive index above the small sub - aperture , ( iii ) inadequate separation of outer mirrors , and ( iv ) mechanical instability .",
    "intensity interferometry considers the quantum theory of photon detection and correlation .",
    "it computes the fluctuations of the intensities @xmath137 , at two different points of the wavefronts .",
    "the fluctuations of the electrical signals from the two detectors are compared by a multiplier .",
    "the current output of each photoelectric detector is proportional to the instantaneous intensity @xmath23 of the incident light , which is the squared modulus of the amplitude @xmath27 .",
    "the fluctuation of the current output is proportional to @xmath138    this expression indicates that the covariance of the intensity fluctuations is the squared modulus of the covariance of the complex amplitude .",
    "having succeeded in completing the intensity interferometer at radio wavelengths ( hanbury brown et al .",
    "1952 ) , hanbury brown and twiss ( 1958 ) demonstrated its potential at optical wavelengths by measuring the angular diameter of sirius .",
    "subsequent development with a pair of 6.5  m light collector on a circular railway track spanning 188  m , provided the measurements of 32 southern binary stars ( hanbury brown , 1974 ) with angular resolution limit of 0.5 milli - arcseconds ( mas ) . in this arrangement ,",
    "starlight collected by two concave mirrors is focused on to two photoelectric cells and the correlation of fluctuations in the photocurrents is measured as a function of mirror separation .",
    "the advantages of such a system over michelson s interferometer are that it does not require high mechanical stability and remains unaffected by seeing .",
    "another noted advantage is that the alignment tolerances are extremely relaxed since the pathlengths need to be maintained to a fraction of @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the electrical bandwidth of the post - detection electronics .",
    "the significant effect comes from scintillation induced by the atmosphere .",
    "the sensitivity of this interferometer was found to be very low ; it was limited by the narrow band - width filters that are used to increase the speckle life time .",
    "the correlated fluctuations can be obtained if the detectors are spaced by less than a speckle width .",
    "theoretical calculations ( roddier , 1988 ) show that the limiting visual magnitude ( mag ) , @xmath141 that can be observed with such a system is of the order of 2 ( the faintest stars visible in the naked eye are 6th magnitude . the magnitude scale is defined as @xmath142 = -2.5 log @xmath143 , where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are the apparent magnitudes of two objects of fluxes @xmath146 and @xmath147 , respectively ) .",

    "the gradients caused by these environmental parameters warp the wavefront incident on the telescope pupil .",
    "the image quality is directly related to the statistics of the perturbations of the incoming wavefront .",
    "the theory of seeing combines the theory of atmospheric turbulence with the theory of optical physics to predict the modifications to the diffraction - limited image that the refractive index gradients produce ( young , 1974 , roddier , 1981 , coulman , 1985 ) .",
    "atmospheric turbulence has a significant effect on the propagation of radio - waves , sound - waves and on the flight of aircraft as well .",
    "this section is devoted to the descriptions of the atmospheric turbulence theory , metrology of seeing and its impact on stellar images .",
    "the random fluctuations in the atmospheric motions occur predominantly due to ( i ) the friction encountered by the air flow at the earth s surface and consequent formation of a wind - velocity profile with large vertical gradients , ( ii ) differential heating of different portions of the earth s surface and the concomitant development of thermal convection , ( iii ) processes associated with formation of clouds involving release of heat of condensation and crystallization , and subsequent changes in the nature of temperature and wind velocity fields , ( iv ) convergence and interaction of air - masses with various atmospheric fronts , and ( v ) obstruction of air - flows by mountain barriers that generate wave - like disturbances and rotor motions on their lee - side .",
    "the atmosphere is difficult to study due to the high reynolds number ( @xmath148 ) , a dimensionless quantity , that characterizes the turbulence . when the average velocity , @xmath149 , of a viscous fluid of characteristic size , @xmath150 , is gradually increased , two distinct states of fluid motion are observed ( tatarski , 1967 , ishimaru , 1978 ) , viz .",

    "these are : ( i ) an improvement of signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios for the individual visibility and closure - phase measurements , ( ii ) attainment of the maximum possible angular resolution by using the longest baselines , and ( iii ) built - in delay to observe objects at low declinations .",

    "they have shown that a human eye with adaptive - optics correction can resolve fine gratings that are invisible to the unaided eye .",
    "ao systems are useful for spectroscopic observations , as well as for low light level imaging with future very large telescopes , and ground - based lbois .",
    "turbulence cells are blown by wind across the telescope aperture , hence , the wind velocity dictates the speed with which a corrective action must be taken .",

    "the ao system bandwidths need to have a response time of order several hundreds to 1  khz .",
    "it is easier to achieve diffraction - limited information using ao systems at longer wavelengths since @xmath249 is proportional to the six - fifths power of the wavelength ,    @xmath336    the above equation ( 94 ) implies that the width of seeing limited images , @xmath337 varies with @xmath3 .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom , i.e. , the number of actuators on the deformable mirror ( dm ) and the number of sub - aperture in the wavefront sensor , in an ao system should be determined by the following equation ,    @xmath338      the required components for implementing an ao system are wavefront sensing , wavefront phase error computation and a flexible mirror whose surface is electronically controlled in real time to create a conjugate surface enabling compensation of the wavefront distortion ( roggemann et al . 1997 and references therein ) . in order to remove the low frequency tilt error , generally the incoming collimated beam is fed by a tip - tilt mirror . after traveling further ,",
    "it reflects off of a dm that eliminates high frequency wavefront errors . a beam - splitter devides the beam into two parts : one",
    "is directed to the wavefront sensor to measure the residual error in the wavefront and to provide information to the actuator control computer to compute the dm actuator voltages and the other is focused to form an image .",
    "implementation of the dynamically controlled active optical components consisting of a tip - tilt mirror system in conjunction with closed - loop control electronics has several advantages : ( i ) conceptually the system is simple , ( ii ) fainter guide stars increase the sky coverage , and ( iii ) field of view is wider ( glindemann , 1997 ) .",
    "these systems are limited to two zernike modes ( x and y tilt ) , while a higher order system compensating many zernike mode ( zernike polynomials are an orthogonal expansion over unit circle ) is required to remove high frequency errors .",
    "a variety of dms have been developed for the applications of ( i ) high energy laser focusing , ( ii ) laser cavity control , ( iii ) compensated imagery through atmospheric turbulence etc .",
    "several wavefront sensors such as ( i ) lateral shearing interferometer , ( ii ) shack - hartman ( sh ) sensor , and ( iii ) the curvature sensor are in use as well .",

    "the phase reconstruction method finds the relationship between the measurements and the unknown values of the wavefronts and can be categorized as being either zonal or modal , depending on whether the estimate is either a phase value in a local zone or a coefficient of an aperture function ( rousset , 1999 ) . in the case of curvature sensing , the computed sensor signals are multiplied by a control matrix to convert wavefront slopes to actuator control signals , the output of which are the increments to be applied to the control voltages on the dm .",
    "a conjugate shape is created using these data by controlling a dm .",
    "the real time computation of the wavefront error , as well as correction of wavefront distortion involves digital manipulation of wavefront sensor data in the wavefront sensor processor , the re - constructor and the low - pass filter , and converting to analog drive signals for the dm actuators .",
    "the functions are ( i ) to compute sub - aperture gradients , phases at the corners of each sub - aperture , low - pass filter phases , and ( ii ) to provide actuator offsets to compensate the fixed optical system errors and real time actuator commands for wavefront corrections .",
    "an ao system requires a reference source to monitor the atmospheric aberrations for measuring the wavefront errors , as well as for mapping the phase on the entrance pupil .",
    "it is generally not possible to find a sufficiently bright reference star close enough to a target star . in order to alleviate this limitation ,",
    "many observatories are currently implementing the artificial laser guide star ( ragazzoni and bonnacini , 1996 , racine et al .",
    "1996 , lloyd - hart et al .",
    "however , the best results are still obtained with natural guide stars .",
    "an artificial guide star can be obtained using either the resonance scattering by sodium in the mesosphere at 90  km ( foy and labeyrie , 1985 ) or rayleigh scattering between 10 and 20  km altitude ( fugate et al . 1994 ) .",

    "thompson and gardner ( 1988 ) stressed the importance of investigating two basic problems : ( i ) the cone effect which arises due to the parallax between the remote astronomical source and artificial source , and ( ii ) the angular anisoplanatic effects .",
    "these effects can be restored by imaging the various turbulent layers of the atmosphere onto different adaptive mirrors ( tallon et al .",
    "scattering of the upward propagating laser beam is due to rayleigh scattering , mostly by @xmath340 molecules .",
    "mie scattering by aerosol or cirrus clouds may be important at lower altitudes but are usually variable and transient .",
    "multi - conjugate ao system enables near - uniform compensation for the atmospheric turbulence over considerably larger field of view than can be corrected with normal ao system .",
    "this method employs an ensemble of guide stars that allows for 3-d tomography of the atmospheric turbulence and a number of altitude - conjugate dms to extend the compensated field of view . however , its performances depends on the quality of the wavefront sensing of the individual layers .",
    "ragazzoni et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have demonstrated this type of tomography .",
    "this new technique pushes the detection limit by @xmath1941.7  mag on unresolved objects with respect to seeing limited images ; it also minimizes the cone effect .",
    "this technique will be useful for the extremely large telescopes of 100  m class , e.g. , the overwhelmingly large ( owl ) telescope ( dierickx and gilmozzi , 1999 ) .",
    "however , the limitations are mainly related to the finite number of actuators in a dm , wavefront sensors , and guide stars .",
    "the usage of a adaptive secondary mirror ( asm ) for corrections making relay optics obsolete that are required to conjugate a dm at a reimaged pupil , as well as to minimize thermal emission is a new key innovation ( bruns et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the other notable advantages are ( i ) enhanced photon throughput that measures the proportion of light which is transmitted through an optical set - up , ( ii ) introduction of negligible extra ir emissivity , ( iii ) causes no extra polarization , and ( iv ) non - addition of reflective losses ( lee et al .",
    "2000 ) . due to the interactuator spacing , the resonant frequency of such",
    "a mirror may be lower than the ao bandwidth .",

    "the relevance of using coronagraphy in imaging or spectroscopy of faint structure near a bright object can be noted in terms of reducing the light coming from the central star , and filtering out of the light at low spatial frequency ; the remaining light at the edge of the pupil corresponds to high frequencies .",

    "coronagraphy with dynamic range can be a powerful tool for direct imaging of extra - solar planets .",
    "nakajima ( 1994 ) estimates that imaging with such a method with a low order ao system in a 6.5  m telescope could detect jupiter - size extra - solar planets at separation @xmath1941.5@xmath2 with s / n of 3 in 10@xmath342  s. rouan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) describes a four - quadrant phase - mask coronagraph where a detection at a contrast of more than 8  mag difference between a star and a planet is feasible .",
    "the dark speckle method uses the randomly moving dark zones between speckles @xmath197 ` dark speckles ' .",
    "it exploits the light cancellation effect in a random coherent field ; highly destructive interferences that depict near black spots in the speckle pattern ( labeyrie , 1995 ) may occur occasionally .",
    "the aim of this method is to detect faint objects around a star when the difference of magnitude is significant .",
    "if a dark speckle is at the location of the companion in the image , the companion emits enough light to reveal itself .",
    "the required system consists of a telescope with an ao system , a coronagraph , a wynne corrector , and a fast photon - counting camera with a low dark noise .",
    "if a pixel of the photon - counting camera is illuminated by the star only ( in the airy rings area ) , because of the ao system , the number of photons in each pixel , for a given interval ( frame ) , is statistically given by a bose - einstein distribution .",
    "the number of photons per frame in the central peak of the image of a point source obeys a classical poisson distribution . for the pixels containing the image of the companion , the number of photons , resulting from both the star and the companion ,",
    "is given by a different distribution ( computed by mixing bose - einstein and poisson distributions ) .",
    "one noticeable property is that the probability to get zero photons in a frame is very low for the pixels containing the image of the companion , and much higher for the pixels containing only the contribution from the star .",
    "therefore , if the ` no photon in the frame ' events for each pixel is counted , and for a very large number of frames , a ` dark map ' can be built that will show the pixels for which the distribution of the number of photons is not bose - einstein type , therefore revealing the location of a faint companion .",
    "the role of the wynne corrector is to give residual speckles the same size regardless the wavelength .",
    "otherwise , dark speckles at a given wavelength would be overlapped by bright speckles at other wavelengths . with",

    "phase boiling , a relatively new technique that consists of adding a small amount of white noise to the actuators in order to get a fast temporal decorrelation of the speckles during long - exposure acquisition , may produce better results .",
    "aime ( 2000 ) has computed the s / n ratio for two different cases : short - exposure and long - exposure . according to him , even with an electron - noise limited detector like a ccd or a near - ir camera multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos )",
    ", the latter can provide better results if the halo has its residual speckles smoothed by fast residual ` seeing ' acting during the long - exposure than building a dark map from short - exposures in the photon - counting mode .",
    "artificial very fast seeing can also be generated by applying fast random noise to the actuators , at amplitude levels comparable to the residual seeing left over by the ao system .",
    "the question is , what is easiest : dark speckle analysis or a ` hyper - turbulated ' long - exposure ? labeyrie ( 2000 ) made simulations supporting the aime s ( 2000 ) results .",
    "boccaletti ( 2001 ) has compared the dark speckle signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) with the long - exposure snr ( angel , 1994 ) .",

    "currently it is impossible to drive a dm at this frequency ( 10  khz ) . with the 5  m palomar telescope boccaletti ( 2001 )",
    "tried to smooth the speckle pattern by adding a straightforward random noise on the actuators ( the dm is equipped with 241 actuators ) at maximum speed of 500  hz .",
    "effectively , the halo is smoothed , but its intensity is also increased , so that the companion snr is actually decreased .",
    "blurring the speckle pattern would probably require wavefront sensor telemetry ; implementation of a hyper - turbulated long - exposure at the palomar is still under study ( boccaletti , 2001 ) .",
    "all the techniques that are described above require a high quality sensor so as to enable one to obtain snap shots with a very high time resolution of the order of ( i ) frame integration of 50  hz , or ( ii ) photon recording rates of a few mhz .",
    "the performance relies on the characteristics of such sensors , e.g. , ( i ) the spectral bandwidth , ( ii ) the quantum efficiency , ( iii ) the detector noise that includes dark current , read - out and amplifier noise , ( iv ) the time lag due to the read - out of the detector , and ( v ) the array size and the spatial resolution .",
    "the frame - transfer intensified ccd ( iccd ) camera employs micro - channel plate ( mcp ) as an intensifier .",

    "these electrons are accelerated to impact a phosphor , thus producing an output pulse of @xmath346 photons .",
    "these photons are directed to the ccd by fiber optic coupling .",
    "the main disadvantage of such system is the poor gain statistics results in the introduction of a noise factor between 2 and 3.5 .",
    "recent development of a non - intensified ccd device which effectively reduces readout noise to less than one electron rms has enabled substantial internal gain within the ccd before the signal reaches the output amplifier ( mackay et al .",
    "such a detector , although the photon counting performance appears moderate for the moment , shows promise for quantitative measurement of diffraction - limited stellar images .",
    "the marked advantage of a photon - counting system is that of reading the signal a posteriori to optimize the correlation time of short - exposures in order to overcome the loss of fringe visibility due to the speckle lifetime ; the typical values for an object of m@xmath347 = 12 over a field of 2.5@xmath2 are less than 50  photons / ms through a narrow - band filter .",
    "the other notable features are , ( i ) capability of determining the position of a detected photon , ( ii ) ability to register individual photons with equal statistical weight and produces signal pulse ( with dead time of a few ns ) , and ( iii ) low dark noise .",
    "the major short comings of the photon - counting system that is based on frame integration ( blazit , 1986 ) arise from the ( i ) calculations of the coordinates which are hardware - limited , and ( ii ) limited dynamic range of the detector .",
    "non - detectability of a pair of photons closer than a minimum separation by the detector yields a loss in high frequency information ; this , in turn , produces a hole in the center of the autocorrelation @xmath197 centreur hole , resulting in the degradation of the power spectra or bispectra ( ft of triple correlation ) of speckle images .",
    "several 2-d photon - counting sensors that allow recording of the position and time of arrival of each detected photons have been developed such as , ( i ) precision analog photon address ( papa ; papaliolios et al .",

    "different spectral channels are employed for differential visibility measurements ( continuum and spectral line ) and use data from one part of the spectrum such as the continuum emission to calibrate another part ( mourard et al .",

    "though with the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) , the two 8.4  m mirrors will be installed on a common alt - az mounting , thus information in the @xmath408 plane can be continuously combined or coadded , most of the interferometers use two apertures and are unable to recover the complex visibility .",

    "ridgway and roddier ( 2000 ) have proposed a project of developing ir_vla with a total baseline of @xmath1941000  m , consisting of 27 telescopes with each aperture of 4  m. another proposed project called ` large - aperture mirror array ' ( lama ) employs eighteen fixed 10  m liquid - mirror telescopes located within a circle of 60  m diameter which collect 50% of the light that falls within this area ( hickson , 2001 ) .",
    "the ` densified - pupil multi - aperture imaging interferometry ' may provide direct images at their focal - plane , albeit it is a subtle technique .",
    "conceptually it differs from the fizeau interferometers which become inefficient when the sub - aperture spacing is large compared to their size .",
    "the reason is that most energy goes in a broad diffractive halo rather than in a narrow interference peak , which precludes obtaining usable snapshot images with kilometric or megametric arrays in space .",
    "densifying the exit pupil , i.e. , distorting it to increase the relative size of the sub - pupils , in such a way that the pattern of sub - aperture centers is preserved , concentrates the halo and intensifies the image ( labeyrie , 1996 ) .",

    "pedretti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have derived the integrated intensities of the central peaks of the images on the star capella that are obtained by taking two separate exposures of 100  s in the fizeau and densified - pupil mode of the hyper - telescope .",

    "an elliptical track is one way of compensating the earth s rotation , but with delay lines , a periodic dilute - aperture can also be built at the scale of 10 kilometers . in space , it would be a periodic hexagonal paving in the case of hyper - telescope version proposed by labeyrie ( 2001 ) for space interferometer , terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) .",
    "this version has a fizeau focus followed by a small pupil densifier , and a coronagraph ( boccaletti et al . 2000 ) . unlike the ground - based elliptic ring where images are directly obtained at a recombination station located at a focus of the ellipse or periodic arrays on the ground , space arrays can be globally pointed .",
    "the cophasing of the array may be done hierarchically ( pedretti and labeyrie , 1999 ) by cophasing triplets of beams ( yielding a honeycomb pattern in the image - plane ) , then triplets of triplets , etc .",
    "piston errors are measurable from the triplet images . another way of analyzing the piston errors ( labeyrie , 1999a ) is an extension of the classical dispersed - fringes used since michelson : a set of monochromatic images recorded with a spectro - imager is organized as an @xmath456 data cube , and its 3-dimensional ft is calculated to extract piston errors in pairs or triplets of apertures .",
    "the advantage of deploying lbi in space is that of observing can be done at any wavelength and for longer duration in the absence of atmospheric turbulence .",
    "the difficulty comes from developing a technology featuring high precision positioning , as well as toughness required for space operation . a new generation of ultra - lightweight active mirrors ( burge et al .",

    "the aim of st3 is the demonstration and validation of technologies that might be used for future space - borne interferometers .",
    "thus , the two elements of st3 should be able to move up to 1  km from each other , while being controlled by a laser metrology .",
    "however , the designed delay - line of st3 can be up to 20  m of optical pathlength only .",
    "this instrument will be used as an imaging interferometer for studying such objects as wolf - rayet or be stars ( linfield and gorham , 1999 ) .",
    "space interferometry mission ( sim ) is also being designed and will be launched by nasa .",
    "the main goal of this interferometer will be to collect the new high - precision astrometry results , including the possibility of jovian planet detection around stars up to 1 kilo - parsec distant and terrestrial planet detection around nearby stars ( unwin et al .",

    "a planet orbiting around a star causes a revolution of the star around the center of gravity defined by the two masses .",
    "like galaxy velocity , this periodical short motion has a radial counterpart measurable from the ground by spectrometry .",
    "the aim of the space interferometers like darwin and tpf is the discovery and characterization of terrestrial planets around nearby stars ( closer than 15  pc ) by direct detection ( i.e. , involving the detection of photons from the planet and not from the star as it is done with doppler - fizeau effect detection or wobble detection ) .",
    "the difficulties for achieving earth - like planet detection come from ( i ) minimizing scattered light from the parent star and ( ii ) the presence of exo - zodiacal light ( infrared emission from the dust surrounding the parent star ) .",
    "interferometric nulling technique will be useful to address the first issue .",
    "the knowledge of the chemical composition of any planetary atmosphere gives hints about the likelihood to find carbon - based life .",

    "however , finding spectral signatures of these gases on an extra - solar planet would be very difficult .",
    "an alternative life indicator would be ozone ( @xmath578 ) , detectable as an absorption feature at 9.6  @xmath344 m . on earth , ozone is photochemically produced from @xmath575 and , as a component of the stratosphere , is not masked by other gases . finding ozone would , therefore , indicate a significant quantity of @xmath579 that should have been produced by photosynthesis ( lger et al .",
    "moreover , for a star - like the sun , detecting ozone can be done 1000 times faster than detecting @xmath575 at 0.76  @xmath344 m : estimates made by angel and woolf ( 1997 ) show that the requirements for planet detection in the visible with an 8  m telescope are not detectable with current technology .",
    "space - borne interferometry projects for years spanning from 2020 to 2050 already exist ; such projects must be regarded as drafts for future instruments . for the post - tpf era",

    "this interferometer would be able to detect an extra - solar planet lines of gases directly produced by biochemical activity .",
    "the next step proposed by nasa is an array of 25 telescopes , 40  m diameter each , that would yield 25@xmath34825 pixel images of an earth - like planet at 10  pc , revealing its geography and eventually oceans or chlorophyll zones .",
    "a comparable project has been proposed by labeyrie ( 1999a ) .",
    "it consists of 150 telescopes , 3  m diameter each , forming an interferometer with a 150  km maximum baseline .",

    "developing lbi for lunar operation consisting of 20 to 27 off - axis parabolic segments carried by robotic hexapodes that are movable during observing run has also been suggested by arnold et al .",
    "earth - bound astronomical observations are strongly affected by atmospheric turbulence that set severe limits on the angular resolution , which in optical domain , is rarely better than @xmath194  0.5@xmath2 .",
    "a basic understanding of interference phenomenon is of paramount importance to other branches of physics and engineering as well . in recent years",
    ", a wide variety of applications of speckle patterns has been found in many areas . though the statistical properties of the speckle pattern is complicated , a detailed analysis of this pattern is useful in information processing .",
    "image - processing is a very important subject . a second - order moment ( power spectrum )",
    "analysis provides only the modulus of the object ft , whereas a third - order moment ( bispectrum ) analysis yields the phase allowing the object to be fully reconstructed . a more recent attempt to go beyond the third order ,",
    "e.g. , fourth - order moment ( trispectrum ) , illustrates its utility in finding optimal quadratic statistics through the weak gravitational lensing effect ( hu , 2001 ) .",
    "this algorithm provides a far more sensitive test than the bispectrum for some possible sources of non - gaussianity ( kunz et al . , 2001 ) , however , its implementation in optical imaging is a difficult computational task .",
    "deconvolution method is an important topic as well .",
    "it applies to imaging in general which covers methods spanning from simple linear deconvolution algorithms to complex non - linear algorithms .    in astronomy",
    ", the field of research that has probably benefited the most from high angular resolution techniques using single telescopes , and will still benefit in the future , is undoubtedly the origin and evolution of stellar systems .",
    "this evolution starts with star formation , including multiplicity , and ends with the mass loss process which recycles heavier elements into the interstellar medium .",
    "large - scale star formation provides coupling between small - scale and large - scale processes .",
    "stellar chemical evolution or nucleo - synthesis that is a result of star formation activity further influences evolutionary process .",
    "high resolution observations are fruitful for the detection of proto - planetary disks and possibly planets ( either astrometrically , through their influence on the disk , or even directly ) .",
    "the technique is also being applied to studies of starburst and seyfert galaxies , agns , and quasars .",
    "studies of the morphology of stellar atmospheres , the circumstellar environment of nova or supernova , ypn , long period variables ( lpv ) , rapid variability of agns etc .",
    "are also essential .    in spite of the limited capability of retrieving fully diffraction - limited images of the objects ,",
    "ao systems are now offered to users of large telescopes .",
    "ao observations have contributed to the study of the solar system , and added to the results of space borne instruments , for examples , monitoring of the volcanic activity on io or of the cloud cover on neptune , the detection of neptune s dark satellites and arcs , and the ongoing discovery of companions to asteroids etc . ; they are now greatly contributing to the study of the sun itself as well ( antoshkin et al .",
    "2000 , rimmele , 2000 ) .",
    "combination of ao systems with speckle imaging may enhance the results ( dayton et al . 1998 ) . by the end of the next decade ( post 2010 ) , observations using the ao system on a new generation telescope like owl ,",
    "will revolutionize the mapping of ultra - faint objects like blazars that exhibit the most rapid and the largest amplitude variations of all agn ( ulrich et al .",
    "1997 ) , extra - solar planets etc . ; certain aspects of galactic evolution like chemical evolution in the virgo cluster of galaxies can be studied as well .",
    "a host of basic problems needs a very high angular resolution for their solution . among others , an important fundamental problem that can be addressed with",
    "the interferometry and ao is the origin and evolution of galaxies .",
    "the upcoming large facilities with phased arrays of multiple 8 - 10  m sub - apertures will provide larger collecting areas and higher spatial resolution simultaneously than the current interferometers .",
    "these instruments fitted with complete ao systems would be able to provide imaging and morphological informations on the faint extragalactic sources such as , galactic centers in the young universe , deep fields , and host galaxies .",
    "measurement of such objects may be made feasible by the instruments with a fairly complete @xmath408 coverage and large field of view .",
    "the derivations of motions and parallaxes of galactic centers seem to be feasible with phase reference techniques .",
    "origin of faint structures close to non - obscured central sources can also be studied in detail with interferometric polarization measurement .",
    "the capabilities of the proposed large arrays offer a revolution in the study of compact astronomical sources from the solar neighborhood to cosmological distances .",
    "the aim ranges from detecting other planetary systems to imaging the black hole driven central engines of quasars and active galaxies ; gamma - ray bursters may be the other candidate .",
    "another important scientific objective is the recording of spectra to derive velocity and to determine black hole masses as a function of redshift . at the beginning of the present millennium",
    ", several such arrays will be in operation both on the ground as well as in space .",
    "space - borne interferometers are currently planned to detect planets either astrometrically ( sim ) or directly ( tpf ) .",

    "<S> the present ` state of the art ' and the path to future progress in high spatial resolution imaging interferometry is reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> the review begins with a treatment of the fundamentals of stellar optical interferometry , the origin , properties , optical effects of turbulence in the earth s atmosphere , the passive methods that are applied on a single telescope to overcome atmospheric image degradation such as speckle interferometry , and various other techniques . </S>",
    "<S> these topics include differential speckle interferometry , speckle spectroscopy and polarimetry , phase diversity , wavefront shearing interferometry , phase - closure methods , dark speckle imaging , as well as the limitations imposed by the detectors on the performance of speckle imaging . </S>",
    "<S> a brief account is given of the technological innovation of adaptive - optics ( ao ) to compensate such atmospheric effects on the image in real time . </S>",
    "<S> a major advancement involves the transition from single - aperture to the dilute - aperture interferometry using multiple telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the review deals with recent developments involving ground - based , and space - based optical arrays . emphasis is placed on the problems specific to delay - lines , beam recombination , polarization , dispersion , fringe - tracking , bootstrapping , coherencing and cophasing , and recovery of the visibility functions . </S>",
    "<S> the role of ao in enhancing visibilities is also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the applications of interferometry , such as imaging , astrometry , and nulling are described . </S>",
    "<S> the mathematical intricacies of the various ` post - detection ' image - processing techniques are examined critically . </S>",
    "<S> the review concludes with a discussion of the astrophysical importance and the perspectives of interferometry .    </S>",
