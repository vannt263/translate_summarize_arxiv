    "it is also clear that as @xmath30 , this bound becomes very poor , particularly due to the exponentiation .",
    "in much modeling of interacting diffusions , such as neuroscience , it is difficult to assume that @xmath31 is small : indeed , often it is difficult to properly model the ` start ' of a system .",
    "it is therefore desirable to obtain convergence results which are uniform in time .",
    "this is the focus of this paper .    for @xmath32 ,",
    "let @xmath33 for some functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 described further below .",
    "we expect ( but do not require ) @xmath36 to be of the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a positive integer .",
    "@xmath36 modulates the rate of convergence for when @xmath16 is ` close ' to @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath35 is a weight function which modulates the behavior for when @xmath39 or @xmath40 asymptote to @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath0 is a metric , then this result guarantees that the wasserstein distance ( with respect to @xmath0 ) between the laws of @xmath16 and @xmath19 converges to zero as @xmath42 , with a rate which is uniform in @xmath43 . as a consequence of theorem [",
    "theorem major result ] , and since @xmath0 is a metric , the result guarantees that the joint law of any finite set of neurons(or particles in the general case ) converges to a tensor product of iid processes , each with law given by the sde in ( [ eqn limit system ] ) .",
    "it is easily verified as explained in corollary [ corollary1 ] . to the best of our knowledge , the first work on uniform propagation of chaos was @xcite when approximating feynman kac formula for non linear filtering .",
    "other authors applied log - sobolev inequalities and concentration inequalities @xcite .",
    "most of the previously cited works assume that the interaction term is of the form @xmath44 and the local term is of the form @xmath45 for some @xmath46 satisfying certain convexity properties .",
    "this work is essentially a generalization of @xcite .",
    "we are motivated in particular by the application of these models to neuroscience ( see for instance @xcite ) although we expect in fact that these results are applicable in other domains such as agent - based modeling in finance , insect - swarms , granular models and various other applications of statistical physics .",
    "we have been able to weaken some of the requirements in @xcite and other works , so that the results may be applied in arguably more biologically realistic contexts .",
    "we do not assume that the interaction term @xmath47 is a function of @xmath48 , as in many of the previously cited works .",
    "the uniform propagation of chaos result is essentially due to the stabilizing effect of the internal dynamics ( @xmath49 term ) outweighing the destabilizing effect of the inputs from other neurons ( @xmath21 term ) and the noise ( @xmath15 term ) . in @xcite",
    ", it was assumed that the gradient of @xmath49 is always negative , and is at least linear .",
    "however it is not clear ( at least in the context of neuroscience ) that the decay resulting from the internal dynamics term is always this strong for large values of @xmath39 .",
    "neuroscientific models are only experimentally validated over a finite parameter range , and therefore it is not certain how to model the dynamics for when the state variable @xmath16 is very large or small .",
    "our more abstract setup does not require the decay to be linear ( as in for example the wilson - cowan model ) for large values of @xmath39 : indeed the decay could be sub - linear or super - linear ; all that is required is that in the asymptotic limit the decay from @xmath49 dominates the destabilizing effects of @xmath21 and @xmath15 .",
    "another improvement of our model over @xcite is that we consider multiplicative noise ( i.e. @xmath50 ) .",
    "this is more realistic because we expect the noise term @xmath51 to be of decreasing influence as @xmath39 gets large .",
    "this is because one would expect in general that the system is less responsive to the noise when its activity is greatly elevated , since the system should be stable .",
    "the point is that experimentalists should have some liberty in fitting our model to experimental data ; all that is required is that in the asymptotic limit the decay from @xmath49 dominates the destabilizing effects of @xmath21 and @xmath15 .",
    "we do not delve into the details of existence and uniqueness of solutions , and so throughout we assume that    [ assumption one ] there exist unique strong solutions to and .",
