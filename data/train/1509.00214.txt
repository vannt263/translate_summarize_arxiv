    "the origin of galactic cosmic rays has remained an unresolved question since their discovery .",
    "one of the most plausible acceleration sites is at the shock front of supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "the discovery of synchrotron x - rays @xcite and very high energy ( vhe ) gamma - rays @xcite from shells of snrs gave some of the first clear evidence of active particle acceleration in these shocks .",
    "the small - scale structure and time variability of synchrotron x - rays imply that the acceleration is very efficient @xcite .",
    "however , it remains an open question how accelerated particles escape from the shocks to become cosmic rays .",
    "recently , fermi detected gev gamma - rays from several snrs @xcite .",
    "interestingly , many of the gev - detected snrs are many times older than the non - thermal x - ray - detected or vhe - gamma - ray - detected snrs @xcite .",
    "moreover , their gev spectra are soft and show a spectral break at energies around 110  gev , implying that high energy particles have already lost their energy or have escaped from the acceleration sites . if the latter is true , their soft spectra show the evidence of particle escape .",
    "however , a larger sample of gev gamma - ray snrs is needed to judge the particle escape scenario .",
    "we searched for gev gamma - ray sources associated with cataloged galactic snrs in the fermi large area telescope third source catalog @xcite .",
    "there are 60 gev gamma - ray sources which spatially coincide with the galactic snrs , in addition to the 12 snrs identified by extended gamma - ray emission .",
    "3fgl  j1214.0@xmath06236 is associated with the radio snr g298.6@xmath00.0 , detected at 408  mhz and 843  mhz with a flat radio spectral index of @xmath00.3 @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported a possible detection of infrared emission from the direction of g298.6@xmath00.0 , implying that the shock of this remnant may have encountered a high - density medium .",
    "these characteristics are common among gev gamma - ray - emitting snrs .",
    "however , no detection has been made in the x - ray band with rosat pspc @xcite .",
    "x - ray information is critical to estimate the physical parameters of the snr , such as age , explosion energy , and the amount of accelerated electrons .",
    "thus , our aim is to identify x - rays from g298.6@xmath00.0 and measure parameters using the low and stable background x - ray observations provided by suzaku @xcite .    in this paper , we report the first x - ray imaging spectroscopy of g298.6@xmath00.0 using suzaku . the observation details are summarized in  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "an analysis of the suzaku x - ray data is presented in  [ sec : results ] , the results of which are discussed in  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "suzaku observed g298.6@xmath00.0 on 2012 , aug .",
    "1113 ( sequence number : 507037010 ) and 2013 , feb .  1819 ( sequence number : 507037020 ) . only three set of the onboard x - ray imaging spectrometers ( xis0 , 1 , 3 ; @xcite ) could be used in this paper , due to a known problem with xis2 .",
    "xis1 is a back - illuminated ccd , whereas the others are front - illuminated .",
    "the xis instruments were operated in the normal - clocking full - frame mode .",
    "spaced - row charge injection technique and the relevant energy calibration method were applied to mitigate the long - term degradation of the energy resolution @xcite .",
    "since the observing mode is the same for the two observations , we analyzed the combined data using headas software version 6.16 and xspec version 12.8.2 .",
    "we reprocessed the data set with the calibration database version 2012 - 11 - 06 for xis and 2011 - 06 - 30 for x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) .    in the xis data screening , we filtered out data acquired during passages through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , with elevation angles with respect to the earth s dark limb below 5  deg , or with elevation angle to the bright limb below 20  deg in order to avoid contamination by emission from the bright limb .",
    "the remaining exposure is 57  ks ( 17  ks for the former observation and 40  ks for the latter observation ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : images ] ( a ) shows 843  mhz @xcite and the xis  1 + 3 0.55  kev band images of g298.6@xmath00.0 region .",
    "xis  0 image is not used due to the dead column .",
    "the position of the fermi source , 3fgl  j1214.0@xmath06236 , is also shown .",
    "the radio emission shows the clear shell - like structure , while x - ray emission has a center - filled morphology inside the radio shell and does not show any prominent point sources .",
    "these results show that g298.6@xmath00.0 is either a snr with a central pulsar or a mixed - morphology snr ( mm snr ; @xcite ) .",
    "the point source located in the north - east of the snr is coincident with the rosat source 1rxs  j121248.7@xmath0623027 @xcite and categorized as a rotationally variable star @xcite , whose details are out of the scope of this paper .",
    "the source spectra of g298.6@xmath00.0 were extracted from circular region with the radius of 3.9  arcmin , whereas the background spectra were taken from the source free region , as shown in figure  [ fig : images ] ( b ) .",
    "we added xis0 and xis3 spectra for the better statistics , whereas xis1 spectrum was treated separately due to the different response from the others .",
    "background - subtracted spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the spectra are rather soft and have emission lines , implying that the emission has a thermal origin .",
    "we thus adopted an optically thin thermal plasma model in collisional ionization equilibrium ( vapec ) affected by interstellar absorption ( phabs ; @xcite ) .",
    "for both the emission and absorption models , the solar abundance values of @xcite were used .",
    "the first fit with fixed abundances at the solar values was rejected with the reduced @xmath2 of 228.6/117 and wavy residuals .",
    "we thus fit with the abundances of mg , si , s , and fe as free parameters .",
    "this improved fit gave a reduced @xmath2 of 136.1/113 .",
    "the best - fit models and parameters are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] and table  [ tab : spectra ] , respectively .",
    "we also tried to fit with non - equilibrium ionization plasma models , vnei for ionizing plasma and vvrnei for recombining plasma .",
    "the abundances of mg , si , s , and fe were treated as free parameters . for a vvrnei model",
    ", we fixed the initial plasma temperature to be 3  kev .",
    "the fitting showed similar reduced @xmath2 of 136.5/112 ( vnei ) and 131.5/112 ( vvrnei ) .",
    "the best - fit values of the ionization / recombination timescale are @xmath3  @xmath4s for the vnei model and 6.2 ( 5.314 ) @xmath5  @xmath4s for the vvrnei model , respectively .",
    "the latter gives a slightly shorter relaxation timescale than that in ionization equilibrium ( @xmath6  s  @xmath4 ) .",
    "however , the improvement of the fit is only marginal ; both models show similar reduced @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , there is no clear indication of strong radiative recombination continuum in the residual which is the direct evidence of a recombining plasma @xcite .",
    "thus we concluded that the plasma is well described by an absorbed plasma emission model in ionization equilibrium .",
    "we note that the xis1 spectrum has residuals in the low energy band , which may be due to the calibration uncertainty of contamination .",
    "we report the first detection of thermal x - rays from inside the radio snr g298.6@xmath00.0 .",
    "the characteristics of g298.6@xmath00.0 classify it as a new mm snr . here , we estimate several physical parameters for this snr .",
    "first , we estimate the distance to this source .",
    "we measured the absorption column to the source to be @xmath7  @xmath8 .",
    "the total hydrogen density throughout the galaxy in this direction is estimated by the method of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 column density in this direction is 1.4  @xmath10  atoms  @xmath8 @xcite , whereas the column density of molecular hydrogen ( @xmath11 ) is 1.4@xmath12  atoms  @xmath8 from the dust map @xcite .",
    "the total absorption column is thus 1.5@xmath10  atoms  @xmath8 , which is similar value to our target .",
    "this indicates that the snr is located in the outer part of the galaxy .",
    "according to the face - on map by @xcite , most of the interstellar hydrogens in this direction are located within 10  kpc from the sun .",
    "thus we adopt the distance of 10  kpc .",
    "this is an independent constraint from that indicated by the @xmath13 relation in the radio band ( 9.5  kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "the previous method only gives a rough estimate and more detailed studies are necessary to get a better measurement of the distance to snr g298.6@xmath00.0 .",
    "assuming the plasma fills a 3.9  arcmin sphere , the total volume is 1.8@xmath14  @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the distance in the unit of 10  kpc .",
    "the average density derived from the emission measure ( table  [ tab : spectra ] ) is 0.2@xmath17  @xmath4 , where @xmath18 is the filling factor .",
    "the total mass and thermal energy can be estimated as 30@xmath19 and @xmath20  erg , respectively .",
    "the large total mass indicates that the main component of the plasma originates from swept - up interstellar medium .",
    "gev emission is coincident with the shell of g298.6@xmath00.0 , which is same to other snr cases @xcite .",
    "the possible interaction with a high - density medium from the direction of this snr is reported @xcite , which is also similar to other gev snr samples . on the other hand , we have no information which part of this snr interacts with high - density medium .",
    "further studies in infrared or molecular cloud bands is needed to conclude the interaction .",
    "the gev spectrum of 3fgl  j1214.0@xmath06236 has a spectral break around a few gev @xcite , which is also similar to the spectra of other gev snrs .",
    "these facts imply that 3fgl  j1214.0@xmath06236 is a possible gev counterpart of g298.6@xmath00.0 .",
    "table  [ tab : comparison ] shows the summary of the properties across the absorption - corrected 0.310  kev and 0.1100  gev bands of the gev gamma - ray emitting mm snrs .",
    "large distance uncertainties for these sources make it difficult to apply a detailed model of the x - ray and gev gamma - ray evolution to the case of g298.6@xmath00.0 .",
    "instead we compare the flux ratio between absorption - corrected x - rays and gev gamma - rays , which is independent from the distance .",
    "we selected samples with known total absorption - corrected x - ray and gev gamma - ray fluxes .",
    "recent studies revealed that some of our samples have x - ray emission from recombining plasma with detailed analysis @xcite , but we concentrate on total x - ray flux from older results as it is an easy comparison for the other fainter sources .",
    "ic443 is a famous mm snrs with gev gamma - rays @xcite , but do not have a good estimate of the total x - ray flux in the literatures due to their large apparent diameters , and thus we did not adopt it as our samples .",
    "we also ignored emission from ejecta reported in w49b and g349.7 + 0.2 @xcite , which contributes only @xmath2110% flux of the total flux .",
    "gev gamma - ray spectra for several sources have spectral breaks around 10  gev ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "to treat fainter sources equally , we used the total energy flux from the fermi source catalog @xcite .",
    "the difference in the fluxes of w44 between the catalog and that derived by @xcite is only about 20% , which is negligible for our study .",
    "we estimated the radii using the catalog of galactic snrs by @xcite .",
    "the flux ratio between 0.310  kev and 0.1100  gev , @xmath22 in table  [ tab : comparison ] , is in the range of @xmath210.130 .",
    "if 3fgl  j1214.0@xmath06236 is the gamma - ray counterpart of g298.6@xmath00.0 , our target has the faintest @xmath22 ratio .",
    "figure  [ fig : r - ratio](a ) shows the radius vs. @xmath22 of mm snrs with gev gamma - rays .",
    "the flux ratio shows decline as the radii of snrs is larger , or snrs evolves older .",
    "the flux ratio of our target is well consistent with this trend .",
    "it is unclear why the flux ratio becomes smaller when mm snrs evolve .",
    "one possibility is that the x - ray luminosity decreases faster due to the expansion and cooling @xcite , whereas the gev gamma - ray luminosity does not decrease . in order to check this hypothesis ,",
    "we have made plots of radius vs. 0.310  kev luminosity ( figure  [ fig : r - ratio](b ) ) or 0.1100  gev luminosity ( figure  [ fig : r - ratio](c ) ) .",
    "this is consistent with our scenario ; the x - ray luminosity become smaller when snrs evolve ( or radii become larger ) , whereas the gamma - ray luminosity is almost constant in the range of @xmath23@xmath24  erg  s@xmath25 .",
    "this is also consistent with previous results in x - rays @xcite and gev gamma - rays @xcite .",
    "the constant gamma - ray flux support our hypothesis that timescale for low - energy particles to escape these snrs is long in comparison to the snr evolution .",
    "this trend also implies that a part of galactic gev unid sources can be very evolved mm snrs without significant detection in x - ray and radio bands .",
    "note that radio surface brightness becomes smaller when the snr evolves @xcite , which makes difficult to detect them together with large angular size .",
    "further study of a large sample of gev gamma - ray snrs is needed to understand this tendancy .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for the fruitful comments .",
