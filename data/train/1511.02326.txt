    "ieee 802.11ad wireless local area network ( wlan ) standard promises multi - giga bits per second ( gbps ) transmission by exploiting the 60 ghz communications @xcite-@xcite , where beamforming technique is necessary to compensate for high path loss . despite this ,",
    "human - induced shadowing , especially blocking , may easily break a link due to the stringent link budget . to cope with this ,",
    "a re - beamforming process can be initiated to find an alternative link @xcite , or a multihop scheme can be adopted to bypass the blockage through one or more relay nodes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these approaches , however , have the problem that the transmitter and receiver detect that the link is lost only after dropping a large amount of data due to the high data rate and a large packet size @xcite .    to address this problem , a spatial diversity technique was proposed by park and pan in their recent work @xcite , where multiple beams along the @xmath0 strongest multiple propagation paths are formed simultaneously during a beamforming process , so that when one of the propagation paths is blocked by a human , there are other propagation paths left to maintain the communication link . as the power gain on each path is set to be equal , the scheme is called equal - gain ( eg ) diversity scheme . although a frequency - flat multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) channel was adopted in their work , the eg scheme is proven effective to combat human - induced shadowing via simulation and experiments .    in this letter",
    "the eg scheme is revisited under a frequency - selective ( fs ) mimo channel , which is more practical for 60 ghz communications , because the bandwidth is sufficiently large to resolve multipaths @xcite . moreover ,",
    "explicit expressions of total power gain are presented , which are not provided in @xcite but necessary in computation of received power .",
    "subsequently , realizing that transmitting a packet is much faster than human - induced shadowing for 60 ghz wlan owing to the multi - gbps speed , a suboptimal spatial diversity scheme called maximal selection ( ms ) is proposed by tracing the shadowing process .",
    "comparison results on received power and bit - error rate ( ber ) show that the proposed scheme not only achieves a higher link margin in both normal and blocked cases , but also reduces implementation complexity .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the number of transmit and receive antennas , respectively .",
    "a mimo fs channel model is adopted here . following the conventions used in @xcite , we assume that the @xmath3-th reflector is located in direction @xmath4 from the transmitter , and @xmath5 from the receiver . the transmit steering vectors , @xmath6 , corresponding to the @xmath3 reflector and associated with direction @xmath4 ,",
    "is expressed as @xmath7^t$ ] , where @xmath8 is the carrier frequency of the signal , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the relative delay for the @xmath11-th transmit antenna versus the first transmit antenna to the same receive antenna over the @xmath3-th path , @xmath12 is the transpose operator .",
    "similarly , the receive steering vectors , @xmath13 , corresponding to the @xmath3-th reflector and associated with direction @xmath5 , is expressed as @xmath14^t$ ] , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the relative delay for the @xmath11-th receive antenna versus the first receive antenna to the same transmit antenna over the @xmath3-th path .",
    "thus , the channel matrix over the @xmath3-th path can be expressed as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the channel coefficient of the @xmath3-th path .",
    "subsequently , taking the multipath delay into account , the fs channel matrix is obtained as @xmath19 = \\sum_{l = 1}^n { { { \\bf{c}}_l}\\delta [ k - { \\delta _ l } ] } $ ] , where @xmath0 is the number of multipaths , @xmath20 is the normalized delay from the first transmit antenna to the first receive antenna over the @xmath3-th path .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath20 was not involved in @xcite ; thus , the channel model reduced to a frequency - flat one there .",
    "the @xmath21-th received sample @xmath22 $ ] over the @xmath0 paths is expressed as @xmath23 & = \\sum_{l=1}^n{\\bf{w}}_r^t{\\bf{c}}_l\\frac{{{\\bf{w}}_t}}{{\\sqrt { { \\bf{w}}_t^h{{\\bf{w}}_t } } } } s[m-\\delta_l ] + { \\bf{w}}_r^t{\\bf{n } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 $ ] is the @xmath21-th transmitted sample with an average power @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are transmit and receive antenna weight vectors ( awvs ) , respectively , @xmath28 is a circularly symmetric complex gaussian noise vector with identical variance for each element . defining the transmit and receive antenna gain over the @xmath3-th path as @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively",
    ", we have @xmath31= \\frac{1}{{\\sqrt { { \\bf{w}}_t^h{{\\bf{w}}_t } } } } \\sum\\limits_{l = 1}^n { { \\alpha _ l}{\\beta _ l}{\\lambda _ l}s[m-\\delta_l ] }   + { \\bf{w}}_r^t{\\bf{n}}.\\ ] ] let @xmath32 denote the channel gain , which accounts for the effect of propagation loss and reflection loss of the @xmath3-th path when beamforming is performed . as eg sets identical power gains , which are channel gains multiplied by antenna gains over each path , we achieve @xmath33 where @xmath34 . hence @xmath22 $ ] can be expressed as @xmath35 = \\frac{1}{{\\sqrt { { \\bf{w}}_t^h{{\\bf{w}}_t } } } } \\sum\\limits_{l = 1}^n { \\frac{{{{\\bar \\lambda } ^{(0)}}}}{{\\lambda _ l^{(0)}}}{\\lambda _ l}s[m-\\delta_l ] }   + { \\bf{w}}_r^t{\\bf{n}}.\\ ] ] it is noted that in a non - shadowing case , the channel gains do not vary , i.e. , @xmath36 ; thus , @xmath22 = { 1}/{{\\sqrt { { \\bf{w}}_t^t{{\\bf{w}}_t } } } } \\sum_{l = 1}^n { { { \\bar \\lambda } ^{(0)}}s[m-\\delta_l ] } + { \\bf{w}}_r^t{\\bf{n}}$ ] .",
    "however , in a shadowing case it does not hold since @xmath37 once @xmath18 varies .    taking the number of transmit and receive antennas into account , one appropriate way to determine",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 is to constrain @xmath40 .",
    "thus , @xmath41 with both the amplitude and phase controlled ( apc ) , the transmit and receive awvs are obtained as @xmath42 where @xmath43^t$ ] , @xmath44^t$ ] , @xmath45 $ ] , @xmath46 $ ] , @xmath47 is the pseudo - inverse operation .",
    "the total power gain for the eg scheme with apc is @xmath48 which is the power gain observed after the receive antenna array versus that before the transmit antenna array .",
    "thus , it depends on the awvs in both ends and the channel gains @xmath18 , as shown in ( [ tgain ] ) .",
    "note that in the above derivations , eg with apc is adopted . in the case that only phase can be controlled ( pc ) , the channel gains can not be precisely set . in such a case , @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    "are obtained by @xmath49 respectively , where @xmath50 is the phase operation .",
    "thus , @xmath22 $ ] is expressed as ( [ eq_ym ] ) instead of ( [ eq_ym1ast ] ) , and the corresponding total power gain is @xmath51",
    "the egc scheme is efficient when the los path is blocked . in the normal case that the los path is not blocked , however , it is not optimal because larger antenna gains are set to poorer paths , i.e. , transmit power is wasted on the nlos paths .",
    "moreover , fs effect is generated and intensified due to the identical - energy multipath components . in this section ,",
    "the optimal gain setting is simply analyzed under an ideal assumption . based on it ,",
    "the corresponding suboptimal diversity scheme is proposed .    with the 2-norm of the transmit and",
    "receive awvs constrained to unity , according to ( [ eq_ym ] ) , the optimal awvs to maximize receive signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is achieved by @xmath52 = \\arg \\mathop { \\max } _ { { { \\bf{w}}_{\\bf{t}}}{\\bf{,}}{{\\bf{w}}_{\\bf{r } } } } { \\kern 1pt } { \\kern 1pt } { \\kern 1pt } { \\kern 1pt } { \\kern 1pt } \\sum\\nolimits_{l = 1}^n |{{\\bf{w}}_r^t{{\\bf{g}}_l}\\lambda _ l}{{\\bf{h}}_l^t{{\\bf{w}}_{\\bf{t}}}}|^2.\\ ] ] thus , the optimal gain setting is @xmath53 and @xmath54 . when @xmath55 , the optimal solution is easily obtained as @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the conjugate operation .",
    "however , when @xmath59 , i.e. , multipath exists , the optimal solution of ( [ eq_opeq ] ) is considerably difficult to obtain . even though exploiting an iterative approach is able to achieve the optimal solution @xcite , it is not necessary to achieve the optimal ber performance , because inter - symbol interference due to multipath is not involved in ( [ eq_opeq ] ) .    to facilitate the analysis , it is natural to assume that the multiple reflection directions do not overlap with each other , i.e. , @xmath60 and @xmath61 when @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the conjugate transpose operation .",
    "in fact , when @xmath1 and @xmath2 are large , the beamwidth of @xmath64 and @xmath65 are narrow , and do not overlap with @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively . thus , @xmath68 and @xmath69 will approximately equal 0",
    ".    let yet @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "under this ideal assumption , we have @xmath72 and @xmath73 , due to the 2-norm constraint of awvs .",
    "let @xmath74 , we achieve @xmath75 where the equality holds when @xmath76 $ ] . this is the optimal gain setting under the assumption , which suggests that the antenna arrays in both the transmitter and the receiver should beamform towards the direction of the strongest path .",
    "in such a case , the received power is larger , and the fs effect is less , which both contribute to improving the link margin .",
    "now the remaining question is how the antenna arrays can always beamform to the direction of the strongest path without dropping data . realizing that a 60 ghz wlan achieves a multi - gbps speed ,",
    "much faster compared with a shadowing process , we propose the _ shadowing tracing _",

    "approach , the transceiver can rapidly change its beam towards the current strongest path without dropping data or time - costly re - beamforming once the on - communication path is being blocked . in @xcite",
    "the typical shadowing duration is 664 ms .",
    "the data octets of the current ieee 802.11ad packet are specified to be within the range of 0 - 262143 @xcite .",
    "hence , the maximal packet duration is only @xmath92 ms if the transmit speed reaches 1 gbps , which means that the packet duration is significantly smaller than the decay duration and the latter can be well traced .",
    "therefore , the ms scheme is applicable in practice .",
    "when communicating on the @xmath84-th path , the weight vectors for ms are @xmath93    in such a case the total power gain can be calculated from ( [ gain ] ) , which is @xmath94 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are gains of the transmit and receive antenna arrays , respectively .    it can be observed that , compared with the eg scheme , the superior points of ms are ( i ) it has a lower computation complexity , because there are no matrix inversions and multiplications when calculating the weight vectors ; ( ii ) it achieves a higher total power gain and does not induce fs effect , because the antenna arrays always beamform towards the direction of the current strongest path .    the extra cost of ms is _",

    "however , _ shadowing tracing _ in the nlos communication state will degrade efficiency , because communication needs a periodical temporary pause , and antenna arrays in both ends need to change beamforming between toward the 1-st and the on - communication path directions , which may elapse tens or hundreds @xmath95s .",
    "the efficiency degradation is @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the beam - switching time , and @xmath89 is the estimation period , which should be significantly smaller than the shadowing duration . as the shadowing duration is about several hundred ms @xcite , by selecting a relatively large estimation period , e.g. , 20 ms , and a common beam - switching time , e.g. , 100 @xmath95s , the typical degradation of efficiency is only @xmath98 , which is minimal and acceptable .",
    "received powers are calculated with the same antenna placement , human - induced shadowing model , path loss model , transmit power as that in @xcite . the reflection loss ( @xmath99 )",
    "is set 0 to 16 db in 8 db step .",
    "a @xmath100 antenna array is used in both the transmitter and the receiver .",
    "the received signal power is achieved by adding the transmit power ( @xmath101 dbm ) and the corresponding total power gain in db .",
    "[ fig : results ] depicts the received signal powers for eg , ms and the non - diversity scheme with different reflection losses . from this figure we observe that , as we expected , when the los path is not blocked , eg receives a lower power than the non - diversity scheme .",

    "by contrast , the proposed ms scheme receives a higher power than the eg scheme in both non - blocked and blocked cases . in the non - blocked case the superiority is more evident when the reflection loss is larger ; while in the blocked case it is the opposite .",
    "we stress that the ms scheme has no power loss compared with the non - diversity scheme when the los path is not blocked .",

    "it can be observed that in the non - blocked case , eg with apc has a significant loss compared with ms , while eg with pc has a smaller loss .",
    "as snr becomes larger , the gap between eg with apc and ms becomes larger .",
    "similar results can be observed with different parameter settings , e.g. , transceiver distance , height of antenna , etc .",
    "this is because in the non - blocked case eg with apc leads to two identical - energy multipath components , which strengthens the fs effect .",
    "eg with pc can not strictly satisfy the target of equal gain on each path due to the phase operation .",
    "hence , the two multipath components have actually different energy , which weakens the fs effect , and thus the corresponding ber is significantly better than that of eg with apc . in the blocked case , most channel energy of eg with pc and apc disperse on the nlos path , because it has a larger channel gain and antenna gain than the blocked los path .",
    "consequently , the fs effect is little and the ber performance of eg with pc and apc become close to that of ms .",
