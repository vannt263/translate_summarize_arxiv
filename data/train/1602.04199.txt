    "on 2015 september 14 the advanced ligo interferometer network detected a high significance candidate gravitational wave ( gw ) event ( designated gw150914 ; @xcite ) and two days later provided spatial location information in the form of probability sky maps @xcite .",
    "the analysis that produced the trigger was sensitive to bursts , suggested a high source mass , and yielded localization contours that enclosed the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) at high confidence .",
    "burst - like gravitational wave signals could originate from the core - collapse of massive stars , and there is evidence that @xmath1 of core - collapse events fail to produce a luminous supernova ( sn ) ; see for example , @xcite .",
    "motivated thus , we initiated observations of the lmc with decam on 2015 september 18 in an effort to search for a potential failed sn through the disappearance of a massive star .",
    "we select 152 high luminosity supergiants that are candidates for becoming failed supernova , locate and verify that the 144 inside our decam data are still present after the ligo event , making it unlikely that gw150914 originated from a failed sn in the lmc . in january 2016",
    "an improved analysis of the ligo data for gw150914 changed both the spatial localization ( moving it away from the lmc ) and the source model ( now shown to be consistent with a binary black hole merger by @xcite ) ; this gw source did not originate from the death of a massive star in the lmc .",
    "our analysis , however , represents an important template for the follow up of future burst - like gw events coincident with very nearby galaxies .",
    "on 2015 september 14 at 09:50:45 ut the advanced ligo interferometers at hanford and livingston recorded burst candidate event gw150914 during engineering run 8 .",
    "this event was triggered by the cwb ( coherent waveburst ) unmodeled burst analysis during real - time data processing . on 2015",
    "september 16 , the ligo virgo collaboration ( lvc ) provided two all - sky localization probability maps for the event , generated from the cwb and lalinferenceburst ( lib ) analyses @xcite .",
    "the cwb online trigger analysis makes minimal assumptions about signal shape by searching for coherent power across the ligo network @xcite .",
    "the lib analysis is a version of the the lalinference analysis @xcite bayesian forward - modeling - based follow up tool that uses a sine - gaussian signal morphology instead of models of compact binary mergers ; for information on both algorithms see @xcite .",
    "no lalinference detection using a compact binary mergers model was announced .",
    "stellar core collapses cause significant signals in the cwb analysis ( but not in lalinference ) though the core collapse would have to be nearby @xcite .",
    "the lvc released localization sky maps of the gw150914 event to make possible electromagnetic follow - up of the gw150914 event ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . the maps provided spatial localizations of 50% and 90% confidence regions encompassing about 200 and 750 deg@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the area enclosing 50% of the total probability passed through the center of the large magellanic cloud , a @xmath2 l@xmath3 galaxy at a distance of 50 kpc @xcite : see the dotted lines showing the enclosed cwb sky map probability in figure  1 .",
    "the high probability ridge line passed over 30 doradus and the proto - globular cluster r136 .",
    "we recently began an observational program using the wide - field dark energy camera ( decam ; @xcite ) on the blanco 4-m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory to search for optical counterparts to gw triggers .",
    "our wide - field search for counterparts to gw150914 is described in the companion paper @xcite ; an overview of the program is in @xcite .",
    "we additionally designed a specific set of observations to search for failed sne in the lmc , using 5-sec @xmath4 and @xmath5 band observations covering 38 deg@xmath0 centered on the lmc on 2015 september 18 and 27 , in seeing of 1.11.3@xmath6 .",
    "subsequently , on 2015 october 3 , the lvc revised its analysis : the data were most consistent with a binary black hole merger @xcite . on 2016 january 13 , the lvc provided new skymaps , the most accurate and authoritative of which was the lalinference analysis @xcite . the new contour enclosing 50% of the total probability shifted southward of the lmc ,",
    "although the lmc is still inside the 90% contour .",
    "[ fig : contours ]",
    "a normal core - collapse sn in the lmc is a remarkably obvious event sn1987a was found by eye as a new 5^th^ magnitude object 24 hours after the core collapse .",
    "core - collapse sne have peak absolute magnitudes of @xmath7 -21 to @xmath7 -14 , which at the distance of the lmc corresponds to apparent magnitudes of -2.5 to 4.5 .",
    "however , it has been argued that up to @xmath720% of core - collapse sne are not optically luminous @xcite , and there is recent evidence that luminous supergiants specifically are prone to be failed sne .",
    "two candidates are currently known : the large binocular telescope survey @xcite found a @xmath8 m@xmath9 star missing , and a hubble space telescope archival survey @xcite , found a @xmath10 m@xmath9 star missing .",
    "these objects are sufficiently nearby that a sn associated with the event would have been detected , by the large binocular telescope survey itself in that case .",
    "in addition , the population of known progenitors to type iip sne lacks red supergiants above @xmath11 m@xmath9 @xcite , suggesting that that more massive red supergiants end in a failed sn .",
    "this line of argument reproduces the current black hole mass function @xcite ; similarily the purely theoretical study of core collapses by @xcite reproduces both the neutron star and black hole mass functions .",
    "pre - collapse , red supergiants are very luminous : @xcite shows that the missing sn progenitors have @xmath12 l@xmath9 .",
    "there are three viable signatures for a failed supernova : ( 1 ) the star might simply collapse to a black hole ; ( 2 ) the unbound outer atmosphere of the star may expand and cool , gaining in luminosity as it expands ; and ( 3 ) there might be a shock from the creation of the neutrinosphere that propagates through the atmosphere to the outer layer , causing a shock breakout flash .",
    "we briefly discuss these potential signatures here .",
    "the hydrogen atmospheres of these supergiants are so marginally bound to the star that the creation and free streaming of the neutrinosphere during core - collapse may remove enough mass to unbind the atmosphere @xcite . if the shock from the neutrinosphere creation is energetic enough it will cause the unbound atmosphere to expand , necessarily cooling and gaining in luminosity as it expands .",
    "@xcite simulated this process using realistic models of 15 and 25 m@xmath9 red supergiants , finding that the transient is long ( @xmath7 year , 10 ^ 3^ k , 10 ^ 6^ l@xmath9 ) , and that the unbinding of the atmosphere was more likely in the 15 m@xmath9 than in the 25 m@xmath9 star .",
    "the shock breakout signature was studied by @xcite who found that it would present a short , hot transient ( @xmath7 week , 10@xmath13k , 10@xmath14 l@xmath9 ) . at the distance of the lmc",
    "this would be remarkably bright : @xmath15 5.1 - 7.6 ( see table  [ table : sig ] ) .",
    "the existence of a shock breakout does , however , depend on sufficient energy in the shock , and this is unclear .",
    "the nadezhin brightening of signature 2 lasts hundreds of days , with a lower bound in luminosity of the pre - collapse luminosity of the star , but possibly rising to @xmath16 l@xmath9 , presumably with an effective temperature starting close to the pre - collapse star and cooling thereafter . at the distance of the lmc ,",
    "this is @xmath17 6.7 - 9.3 .",
    "these objects would look much like the supergiant has brightened by a couple of magnitudes .",

    "our search focuses on high luminosity red supergiants in the lmc ; we will consider other candidate failed supernova progenitors in the next section .",
    "the two best studies of large numbers of lmc supergiants are by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both combine 2mass point source data @xcite with astrometric catalogs ( ucac-3 or usno - b1 ; @xcite ) , using proper motions to reject milky way ( mw ) stars , and then using infrared colors and @xmath20 magnitudes to select the supergiants . both studies performed spectroscopy for their final identifications",
    "the distinction between red supergiants and yellow supergiants , for our purpose at @xmath21 mag , is useful here as it brings out the nature of the contamination in the catalogs .",
    "as one moves from yellow to red supergiants , the contamination from milky way dwarfs and giants decreases substantially .",
    "@xcite found 22% purity for their yellow supergiant catalog and a 97% purity for their red supergiant catalog .",
    "@xcite , performing a more detailed spectral analysis , measured a 53% purity for the red supergiants , largely contaminated by carbon stars and mw giants . at @xmath22 mag ( @xmath23 mag ) , the purity was @xmath24 , consistent with @xcite",
    ".    the aforementioned studies did not cover the entire lmc : @xcite covered @xmath7 22 deg@xmath0 of the lmc , about 60% of the relevant area , while @xcite covered a @xmath7 3 deg@xmath0 field at the densest part of the lmc . in the region of overlap , the latter analysis recovered about 3 times as many red supergiants as the former analysis .",
    "both studies are also likely incomplete in regions of very high stellar density ( e.g. , r136 ) .",
    "reddening is not a factor for the @xmath25 and @xmath20 bands , except for progenitors obscured by molecular clouds .",
    "otherwise , the highest extinction 3 arcmin@xmath0 field in the lmc has @xmath26 mag , and only 0.26 deg@xmath0 in the 200 deg@xmath0 around the lmc has @xmath27 mag ; these correspond to only 0.6 and 0.3 mag of extinction in the @xmath20-band , respectively .",
    "we construct a catalog of luminous red supergiants in the lmc following a similar analysis to that of @xcite .",
    "we begin with the 2mass point source catalog within @xmath28 from @xmath29 , and apply the following selection criteria :    1 .",
    "@xmath30 mag , @xmath31 mag , 2 .",
    "the pseudo - color cut of @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , 3 .",
    "@xmath34 , 4 .",
    "reject stars which have proper motions of @xmath35 mas yr@xmath36 with @xmath37 in the nomad catalog@xcite .",
    "the bolometric luminosity cut calculation follows @xcite , namely , the @xmath38 color is used to estimate the effective temperature , and the effective temperature is in turn used to calculate the bolometric correction",
    ".    this process yields 152 red supergiant candidates .",
    "this is smaller than the number of supergiants in either the catalogs of @xcite or @xcite as these studies go to much lower luminosities than we are concerned with here .",
    "this is evident from figure  2 .",
    "the highest luminosity candidates are likely all mw stars ; the neugent et al data show that 90% of their candidates at @xmath39 were mw stars .",
    "as we aim for completeness we find this acceptable . in figure",
    "3 the candidate supergiants are shown overlaid on a stellar density map of the lmc .     vs.  @xmath20 diagram for the @xcite yellow supergiants ( yellow circles ) and red supergiants ( red circles ) , @xcite red supergiants ( purple diamonds ) , and",
    "the 152 supergiant candidates found here ( white circles ) . for our candidates ,",
    "the uncertainties in both @xmath38 and @xmath20 are plotted ; for @xmath20 they are smaller than the symbols .",
    "the line shows the dividing line for @xmath40 l@xmath9 . , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=52.0% ] [ fig : supergiants ]",
    "the red supergiant catalog has the advantage of being well defined and motivated by observational evidence , but it does have uncertainties . these include the calculation of the @xmath41 l@xmath9 limit and model uncertainties when mapping the mass to luminosity .",
    "there are more profound uncertainties in the theory .",
    "smartt s analysis does not imply that only high luminosity red supergiants could fail to explode .",
    "the current theoretical models of core collapsing stars either have islands of core - collapse to black holes at @xmath720m@xmath9 and @xmath740m@xmath9 , @xcite or have most stars above @xmath720m@xmath9 core collapsing to black holes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* with the interesting exception of an island of explosion at @xmath4226m@xmath9 ) , though examples of core collapse to black holes occur throughout the range 15m@xmath9120m@xmath9 in the latter study .",
    "the lack of explosion depends on many parameters , notably metallicity @xcite as the lmc averages half solar metallicity . in theory ,",
    "then , a direct collapse to black holes may occur in many observational classes of massive stars : yellow supergiants , blue supergiants , luminous blue variable stars ( lbvs ) , wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , sgb[e ] , and more ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "fortunately , these classes of stars have been extensively studied in the lmc .",
    "the area covered in our decam lmc campaign is shown in figure  3 .",
    "the decam images were analyzed with the des first cut reductions @xcite , which include producing astrometrically calibrated reduced images .",
    "we visually inspected the locations of the red supergiants in our catalog .",
    "the supergiants were mostly saturated in the images , so we could not investigate the brightening discussed in the previous section .",
    "our imaging and subsequent visual inspection covered 144 supergiants , 95% of the original catalog , and all of these stars were recovered .",
    "we argue that this is the level of confidence excluding a luminous red supergiant undergoing a failed sn in the lmc at the time of gw150914 .",
    "the catalogs of other possible failed sn progenitors are present in the literature .",
    "we can check for the disappearence of less luminous red supergiants and yellow supergiants using the catalog of @xcite : 813 of 846 ( 96% ) are in the imaged area and all of these are present in the images .",
    "we can check for the disapperance of wr stars using the catalog of @xcite , extensive but known not to be complete @xcite : 105 of 108 ( 97% ) are in our imaged area and we can confirm that 102 ( 97% ) are present .",
    "the three that we can not confirm are in the very compact cluster r136 , and are unresolved in our data .",
    "we can check for the disappearence of lbvs using the stars from @xcite , which are all the confirmed , not highly reddened , lbvs in the lmc : we recover 16 of 16 ( 100% ) in the decam imaging",
    ". we could have checked blue supergiants , including the interesting subclass sgb[e ] , using the catalog in @xcite .",
    "as these catalogs are incomplete , it is difficult to state how confident we are that these kinds of progenitors did not undergo a failed sn in the lmv at the time of gw150914 , but given the uncertainty in theoretical predictions for which observational classes of stars undergo failed sn , a reasonable compromise is to check the known catalogs of potential progenitors .",

    "gw150914 was first detected by a ligo analysis sensitive to a burst of gw and the high probability localization contours enclosed the lmc .",
    "burst - like gravitational wave signals could originate from the core - collapse of massive stars , perhaps @xmath720% of which fail to explode as luminous sne .",
    "this motivated us to search for a failed sn in the lmc .",
    "we constructed a catalog of 152 high luminosity lmc supergiants , of which 144 were observed in our decam imaging ; all of these stars are still present after the ligo event .",
    "it is unlikely that the then candidate event gw150914 originated from a failed sn in the lmc .",
    "the subsequent publication of the gw150914 analysis shows that the gw event is consistent with a merging massive binary black hole model at @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the spatial uncertainty present in gw150914 will be a feature of all non - electromagnetic core - collapse triggers .",
    "most models of a core collapse , whether the final stage is a neutron star or a black hole , include the formation of a neutrinosphere ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",

    "the spatial localization of the neutrino detectors is several degrees @xcite  that would be good enough to say the event likely occured in the lmc , but not where in the lmc it is located .",
    "the use of the luminous red supergiant catalog makes it possible to perform a specific search without prior template imaging , and therefore without difference imaging .",
    "a sensible generalization of this technique is to perform very shallow @xmath45 and @xmath4 band imaging of very nearby galaxies to prepare template images for difference imaging ; @xmath45 band added to catch the very blue signature of a breakout shock .",
    "difference imaging in the crowded regions of the lmc will likely be challenging , but would extend the discovery space to other possible low luminosity core collapse progenitors , of which there are many .",
