    "[ sec:1 ] in this paper we are interested in swarm modelling which represents the collective behavior of interacting agents of similar size and shape such that insects , birds or aerial vehicles . inside the swarm ,",
    "agents communicate with each other , working together to accomplish tasks and reach goals . as an example , in the last few years , the use of unmanned aerial vehicles swarm has been widely developed for numerous applications including monitoring of natural disasters , industrial accidents , surveillance of crowds , sensing in large environments , search and rescue missions , searching for sources of pollution , closed observation of protected areas and many others ( see for instance @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "main advantages are that the considered swarm can cover quickly a large area only requiring one operator or can scan high - risk sites rapidly whereas large vehicle can not .",
    "all of these real - world challenges motivate serious investigations on how to control multiple vehicles cooperating automatically to accomplish a given task .    on the other hand ,",
    "nature provides great examples of decentralized , coordinated behaviors in groups of living organisms .",
    "indeed , it is surprising how swarms of insects or flocks of birds can travel in large , dense groups without colliding ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . even in the presence of external obstacles",
    "these agents are able to avoid collisions smoothly and such biological groups are remarkably effective at maintaining optimized group structure , detecting and avoiding obstacles and predators , and performing other complex tasks . observing animals or pedestrians collective motion , remarkable patterns known as",
    "emergent behaviors are achieved by following simple rules .",
    "such impressive inter - agent coordination is accomplished despite their natural physiological constraints .",
    "although individual agents have limited sensing capability and can not see the whole formation , they can form a flock with no apparent leader , which implies the lack of a centralized command .",
    "this highly coordinated collective behavior emerges from localized interactions among individuals within the swarm .    in this context ,",
    "the objective of this paper is to propose a three dimensional model for a swarm of aerial vehicles inspired by coordinated behaviors of such biological groups .",
    "the following key points will be taken into account .",
    "first , the model will be based on a sequence of simple rules followed by every individual ( microscopic level ) .",
    "then , it will include constraints related to limited sensor information .",
    "moreover , since many applications occurs in a high density traffic environment , the model will result in safe paths for all individuals .    to reach our objective",
    ", we consider an interacting particle system for the collective behavior of swarms @xcite . in behavioral based methods , all the agents are considered equal and they adopt behaviors built on informations coming from their only neighborhood .",
    "the behavior of an agent is usually based on simple rules .",
    "thanks to the feedback shared between neighboring agents , these methods are following a decentralized approach making it easily scalable . according to @xcite , in high density traffic situations",
    ", it is recommended to use a decentralized coordination , even if there is less freedom for maneuver .",
    "however , it is usually difficult to predict the group behavior , and the stability of the formation is generally not easy to prove either .",
    "these methods are among the first to have been used in motion planning for multi - agent systems as they are easily stated and generally efficiently scalable since their rules are supposed to be implemented independently for each agent .",
    "safe paths is related to collision avoidance which plays an important role in the context of managing multiple vehicles .",
    "it has been an active area of research in the field of robotics using the collision cone method @xcite and the inevitable collision states approach @xcite .",
    "the collision cone approach can be used to determine whether two objects , of irregular shapes and arbitrary sizes , are on a collision course .",
    "it has been the basis for many collision / obstacle avoidance algorithms @xcite .",
    "these methods are developed with robotic application with knowledge about the obstacles ( position , velocity , and acceleration ) @xcite .",
    "there have been also some research on aircraft collision avoidance both from the multiple vehicles and the air traffic control points of view .",
    "all these collision avoidance procedures are based on three steps : see , detect , and avoid @xcite .",
    "but most of the algorithms developed for air traffic management are those that guarantee safe trajectories in a very low density traffic involving only two or three aircraft .",
    "another approach for collision avoidance is artificial potential based methods where individuals are treated like charged particles of same charge that repel each other ; whereas the destination of an individual is modeled as a charge of the opposite sign so as to attract or navigate it toward the destination .",
    "the artificial potential methods are susceptible to local minima and require breaking forces @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "our goal is first to develop a three dimensional dynamical approach describing the motions of @xmath0 individual and interacting particles .",
    "the model is inspired from the ones developed in @xcite and @xcite for pedestrians collective motion in 2d but here we are concerned with 3d motion of aerial vehicles or birds which leads to an enhanced but more complex dynamics . based on the vision based approach , we propose a model decomposed in two phases for collision avoidance including both particle to particle and moving obstacles avoidance .",
    "when dealing with large populations , in both cases one faces the well - known problem of the curse of dimensionality , term first coined by bellman precisely in the context of dynamic optimization : the complexity of numerical computations of the solutions of the above problems blows up as the size of the population increases .",
    "a possible way out is the so - called mean - field approach , where the individual influence of the entire population on the dynamics of a single agent is replaced by an averaged one .",
    "this substitution principle results in a unique mean - field equation and allows the computation of solutions , cutting loose from the dimensionality .",
    "therefore , we perform a mean field limit of the microscopic model to replace self - interactions between particles by self - consistent fields .",
    "the mean field approximation corresponds to the case where the force itself depends on some average of the distribution function . as a consequence ,",
    "binary interactions between particles are not described but instead their global effect on each particle is taken into account . this approximation is justified especially in the configuration where the swarm is very closed to the target and therefore identifying binary interaction is very complex . as a result , we obtain a space - inhomogeneous kinetic pdes .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ] , we present the individual agent based model proposed for self - propelled particle swarms including collision avoidance . in section [ sec:3 ] ,",
    "the associated mean - field limit is formally derived and analysed .",
    "section [ sec:4 ] is devoted to numerical experiments of the microscopic model .",
    "we conclude with final remarks and future works in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "[ sec:2 ]    we are interested in modeling the motion of individuals ( vehicles , birds , .. ) with the objective to drive each individual of the swarm to a target point @xmath1 without colliding with any moving obstacles or other individuals .",
    "since we consider a swarm we do not explicitly constrain the relative location of each individual .",
    "this section is devoted to the presentation of the microscopic model considering @xmath0 particles with position @xmath2 and velocity @xmath3 , with @xmath4 .",
    "then , we derive a three - dimensional interacting particle system . the agent - based model we consider is inspired from the one proposed in @xcite,@xcite and @xcite developed for crowd dynamics . in these references , the heuristic - based model proposes that pedestrians follow a heuristic rule composed of two phases :    1 .   a perception phase ; 2 .   a decision - making phase .    in the perception phase",
    ", the subjects make an assessment of the dangerousness of the possible encounters in all the possible directions of motion . in the decision - making phase",
    ", they turn towards the direction which minimizes the distance walked towards their target while avoiding encounters with other pedestrians . here",
    ", we mainly follow the same assumptions to describe the perception phase , but then the individual changes its velocity in order to minimize the probability of collision .      in this section",
    ", we discuss the perception phase .",

    "then only the particle @xmath12 will rotate in order to avoid collision along a rotation axis defined by a vector field @xmath105 which has to be determined such that @xmath143 therefore we apply the same strategy as the one presented below to determine the condition for which the time derivative of the polar angle @xmath127 and @xmath129 will increase .",
    "hence we prove the following result .",

    "finally , taking into account all the interactions between particles at time @xmath11 , the force field applied for collision avoidance is given by the sum of interactions as @xmath159 with a rotational axis @xmath105 given by @xmath160 whereas the frequency @xmath107 is chosen as @xmath161 @xmath162 with the function @xmath163 corresponds to either cooperative or non - cooperative actions as explained above , @xmath164    note that in the particular case where @xmath88 is colinear to @xmath165 , the vector @xmath166 .",
    "therefore , in that case we choose it as @xmath167      using the same strategy as the one described below , obstacles @xmath168 are treated as particles , where the particle interacts with the closest point belonging to the intersection of the obstacle and the vision cone of the particle @xmath12 at time @xmath33 , @xmath169 whereas @xmath170 is the given velocity of the obstacle .",

    "on the other hand , a force @xmath171 is applied to steer particle @xmath12 to its destination .",
    "the potential @xmath172 is the distance function @xmath173 where @xmath174 represents the location of the target , whereas a friction term is added to control the speed of the particle @xmath5 .",
    "hence the particle @xmath12 is directed by the sum of the gradient of the potential field @xmath175 and the friction force in the following manner @xmath176 where @xmath177 represents the friction coefficient .",
    "obviously , the motion of particles is not fully deterministic .",
    "when some decisions need to be made in front of several alternatives , the response of the subjects is subject - dependent .",
    "the simplest way to model this inherent uncertainty consists in adding a brownian motion in velocity @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the noise intensity and where @xmath180 are standard white noises in 3d , which are independent from one particle to another one .",
    "the circle means that the stochastic differential equation must be understood in the stratonovich sense .",
    "the integration of this stochastic differential equation generates a brownian motion @xcite .",
    "this stochastic term adds up to the previous ones .",
    "finally from the requirements defined in the perception and decision making phases , we get the following model constructed from the force field @xmath181 and @xmath182 , @xmath183 where @xmath184 are given in ( [ model:1])-([model:2 ] ) .    note that in the two dimensional case , the interactions occur in the horizontal plane and the rotation axis is parallel to @xmath185 , hence we recover the model proposed for pedestrian in @xcite .",
    "consider the solution @xmath186 to the agent - based model ( [ eq : dynamics ] ) without noise ( @xmath187 ) .",
    "then the energy given by @xmath188 satisfies the following estimate @xmath189    simply multiply the second equation of ( [ eq : dynamics ] ) by @xmath14 and integrate by part . by orthogonality property",
    ", we get the energy estimate .",
    "we now introduce a statistical description of the system . instead of using the exact positions , velocities of particles , we rather describe the system in terms of the probability distribution @xmath190 .",
    "specifically , @xmath191 is the probability of finding particles in a small physical volume @xmath192 about point @xmath193 , within a velocity neighborhood @xmath194 of velocity @xmath195 at time @xmath34 .",
    "if the force term is due to purely external causes or smoothly depends on the distribution function @xmath196 , it can be shown that @xmath197 satisfies the following kinetic equation : @xmath198 where @xmath199 corresponds to the interaction term in ( [ eq : dynamics ] ) and is given by @xmath200 where @xmath163 is the function characterizing the kind of interaction ( cooperative or non - cooperative ) and is given by @xmath201 whereas @xmath202 represents the intersection of the dangerous zone and the vision cone @xmath203 with @xmath204 given by @xmath205 and the function @xmath206 and @xmath207 corresponds to @xmath208 finally @xmath209 is given by @xmath210",

    "we choose a smooth external potential @xmath172 such that @xmath211 and the friction coefficient is fixed to @xmath212 . furthermore to emphasize the effect of the collision avoidance process we neglect the noise and set @xmath187 in our simulations .",
    "we first consider the simple situation where all particles move in a direction parallel to the horizontal plane .",
    "initially , all the particles are located in a circle and want to move on the opposite direction . therefore in this very specific situation , the collision point of all particles is the center of the circle .",
    "we consider the microscopic model without any noise @xmath187 and choose @xmath213 .",
    "for the vision cone given in definition [ visioncone ] we take @xmath214 whereas the axis of rotation and the turning frequency are given in ( [ model:0])-([model:2 ] ) .    since the motion occurs in the horizontal plane",

    "[ fig : test0 - 1 ] , we present the numerical results with two , theree , four and nine particles and observe that the present model preserves perfectly the symmetry . furthermore , due to the perception phase , the collision is anticipated which seems to guarantee a smooth trajectory and not a brutal change of direction .

    "[ sec:5 ] in this article , we have proposed a three dimensional dynamical model for collision avoidance based on previous works in two dimension for pedestrian flows @xcite .",
    "this individual based model relies on a vision - based framework : the particles analyze the scene and react to the collision threatening partners by changing their direction of motion .",
    "we have also proposed a kinetic version of this individual based model and perform some numerical experiments which illustrate the ability of the microscopic model to avoid collisions in three dimension .    in a future work",
    ", the approach developed in section [ sec:3 ] , which is based on a mean field model , will be investigated to study the collision avoidance process in the presence of many vehicles .",
    "indeed for a large number of particles , sensors are not able to distinguish each individual but only clouds of particles are detected , the application of mean field models may contribute on the design of efficient algorithms since the sum of interacting particles is replaced by a self consistent force .",
    "on the other hand , more precise models can be applied to describe the motion in three dimension of vehicles as multi - agent dynamics where each agent is described by its position and body attitude .",
    "more precisely , each agent travels in a given direction and its frame can rotate around it adopting different configurations . in this manner , the frame attitude is described by three orthonormal axes giving rotation matrices @xcite ."
