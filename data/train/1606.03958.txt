    "a consequence of the difference between @xmath17 and @xmath23 across many systems exhibiting crackling noise is the breakdown of self - similarity in the triggering process in those cases  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the number of triggered events of a given energy will explicitly depend on the energy of the trigger and not just their energy ratio : since the magnitudes of the triggered events or aftershocks are distributed according to @xmath24 , the number of events with magnitude @xmath25 triggered by an event of magnitude @xmath15 scales as @xmath26 for constant @xmath27 in eq .  .",

    "an explicit dependence on @xmath15 would imply that the triggering process inducing a number of events of , say , magnitude @xmath32 due to an event of magnitude @xmath33 is fundamentally different from the triggering process inducing a number of events of magnitude @xmath34 due to an event of magnitude @xmath35 .    to reconcile different values of @xmath17 and @xmath23 with self - similar triggering , we build on the well - established behavior of equilibrium critical phenomena and propose a natural generalization of the ou relation that is consistent with a self - similar triggering process .",
    "specifically , we build on the fact that critical phenomena can be characterized not only by critical exponents but also by universal scaling functions that describe the behavior near equilibrium critical points  @xcite . a general way to cast the event - event triggering rates into such a scaling form under the condition that the rates should only depend on the energy ratios between trigger and triggered event or , equivalently , their magnitude difference @xmath29 is the following ansatz @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are two time scales varying only with @xmath31 .",
    "in fact , an approach based on a limited scaling form with a constant @xmath39 was previously introduced by lippiello _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in this paper , by analyzing high - resolution earthquake data from southern california , we show that only the full self - similar generalization of the ou relation , in a form following eq",
    ".   with both @xmath40 and @xmath41 scaling with @xmath31 and with a specific functional form of @xmath42 , is consistent with all empirical relations .",
    "in this generalized form of the ou relation , self - similarity is present even in the case of a non - constant @xmath27 and @xmath30 .",
    "self - similarity in the ou relation   is violated if the _ number _ of the directly triggered events of magnitude @xmath25 does explicitly depend on the main shock magnitude @xmath15 , and not only on the magnitude difference . to ensure self - similarity and consistency with empirical observations , we propose the following generalization of the ou relation for _ conditional _ event - event triggering rates : @xmath43 with time scales @xmath44 scaling with @xmath45 ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 are supposedly universal scaling exponents while @xmath48 and @xmath49 are constant prefactors ) .",
    "specifically , @xmath50 is the rate of events or aftershocks of magnitude @xmath25 at time @xmath9 triggered directly by an event of magnitude @xmath15 at time @xmath51 .",
    "this generalized ou relation corresponds to eq .   with @xmath52 , hence it is a natural generalization in the sense that @xmath42 is consistent with the standard ou form and all parameters now depend explicitly and exclusively on @xmath45 .",
    "note also that eq .",
    "does not require @xmath53 but it is applicable to all magnitude or energy combinations such that it encompasses what is often considered main shock - aftershock pairs as well as foreshock - main shock pairs .    with a simple mathematical derivation ( see @xcite for a somewhat similar derivation in a context in which the magnitude of the largest aftershock is assumed to play a significant role ) , we may show that eq",
    ".   ensures self - similarity , as the total number of triggered events of magnitude @xmath25 , @xmath54 depends only on @xmath45 .",
    "such self - similar generalization of the ou relation is consistent with the gr relation since @xmath55 thus , we have the scaling relation @xmath56 indicating that only two out of these three scaling exponents are independent . hence , the generalized ou relation does not introduce an additional independent parameter compared to the standard ou relation with its associated productivity relation .",
    "in particular , for @xmath57 we also have a generalized productivity relation @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 note that this implies that @xmath61 and @xmath62 do _ not _ scale the same way with @xmath45 if @xmath63 , which explicitly allows @xmath64 in our self - similar framework .    a related consequence of the generalized ou relation given by eqs .",
    "and   is that the gr relation for triggered events needs to be modified if only triggered events over short time intervals are considered .",
    "for example , the number of triggered events or aftershocks of magnitude @xmath25 up to time @xmath65 , @xmath66 only follows the gr relation   for @xmath67 . for finite @xmath65",
    ", @xmath68 has two power - law regimes : for small @xmath25 , it decays with exponent @xmath69 while it decays with exponent @xmath70 for large @xmath25 .",
    "the transition point is around a magnitude @xmath71 for which @xmath72 .",
    "thus , the transition point moves to lower magnitudes for increasing @xmath65 , recovering the full gr relation for @xmath67 .",
    "note that only for @xmath73  corresponding to a constant @xmath40  the gr relation holds for all @xmath65 .",

    "one easily verifies that such integrated rates inherit the scale invariance with respect to @xmath75 . moreover , these integrated rates have a functional form very similar to the classic ou relation for realistic situations .",
    "see the supplementary information for more details .    to summarize , the proposed self - similar form of the conditional event - event triggering rates can indeed be considered a realistic generalization of the classic ou relation as it is consistent with the gr relation , the productivity relation as well as the classic form of the ou relation for integrated rates .      to test the validity of the self - similar ou relation , we analyze the event - event triggering for earthquakes in southern california .",

    "this value emerges independently of @xmath90 .",
    "deviations from @xmath88 , for main shocks with @xmath91 , are consistent with the established presence of earthquake swarms in southern california  @xcite .",

    "short - term aftershock incompleteness ( stai ) is intrinsic to many earthquake catalogs .",
    "stai arises from overlapping wave forms and/or detector saturation , in particular after large shocks , such that events are missed in the coda of preceding ones  @xcite .",
    "this detection problem is not specific to earthquakes but a general problem related to crackling noise and the identification of `` events '' from recordings .",

    "thus , variations in @xmath27 with @xmath45 for large @xmath45 are typically expected due to stai  @xcite .",
    "let us discuss several points that exclude stai as a source of the self - similarity in the underlying triggering process observed for the data from sc .",
    "first , stai is not relevant for foreshocks ( @xmath92 ) and it has only minor effects for large aftershocks . yet",
    ", the same scaling emerges over the whole range , namely for @xmath93 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ou ] .",
    "moreover , the scaling collapse shown in fig .  [ fig : ou](b ) does even improve if we exclude rates with large @xmath45 : the rates at small times for large @xmath45 are systematically smaller than what the scaling collapse of the other rates suggests . similarly , the estimated @xmath27-values are also systematically higher for the largest @xmath45 s ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fit](d ) )",
    ". both effects are consistent with stai .",
    "thus , stai is present , it leads to minor deviations from the proposed self - similar ou , but it can not explain the observed self - similar behavior itself .",
    "second , the direct estimates of @xmath17 , @xmath10 and @xmath23 are not significantly affected by stai , since they either reflect the behavior at later times ( @xmath17 , @xmath10 ) or do not vary with magnitude threshold @xmath20 ( @xmath94 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : fit](a ) ) . with these values and the scaling relations   and  , the other two exponents @xmath81 and",
    "@xmath69 are fully determined .",
    "hence , the scaling of @xmath40 with @xmath45 is needed for consistency of the empirical picture where the complete set of five exponents is redundantly determined by direct estimates and scaling relations .",
    "one should thus understand the physical mechanisms generating non - trivial @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "third , the limited effect of stai is also evident from the number of triggered events over finite time intervals , defined in eq .  .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) shows two examples .",
    "for main shocks with @xmath95 and considering only aftershocks up to time @xmath96h , we observe the two regimes predicted by the proposed self - similar generalization of the ou relation : one at low @xmath2 consistent with the value of @xmath97 determined above , and a second regime at larger @xmath2 with an exponent consistent with @xmath98 .",
    "the typical effect of stai of a temporary increase in the local magnitude of completeness is visible at the lowest magnitudes , where it leads to missing events and strong deviations from the proposed scaling behavior for aftershocks with @xmath99 .",
    "this effect is not visible for smaller main shocks as the second example in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) shows : for @xmath100 , no deviations from the behavior predicted by the self - similar ou relation are visible on time scales longer than about 70sec .",
    "the prediction by the self - similar ou relation of two power - laws in the time - limited frequency - magnitude distribution plus a third regime due to stai as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) also allows us to revisit previously published work from a new perspective . in fact",
    ", it might be possible to partially connect documented temporal variations of the @xmath18-value  @xcite with ( previously unnoticed ) behavior in the time - limited frequency - magnitude distribution .",
    "@xcite provides a specific example using a high - resolution catalog that has very carefully addressed the issue of stai : the time - limited frequency - magnitude distribution of aftershocks in japan shown in their fig .",
    "8b provides evidence for two different regimes above the magnitude of completeness .",
    "this supports the proposed self - similar ou relation beyond the catalog studied here , while fully taking stai into account .      as a final step to confirm that our analysis is able to distinguish the proposed self - similar ou relation from non - self - similar versions for the conditional rates , we repeat it on synthetic catalogs generated by ( a ) the standard epidemic - type aftershock sequence ( etas ) model ( which is not self - similar if the unconditional rates follow the classic ou relation with constant @xmath27 and @xmath30 )  @xcite , and ( b ) our own variant built on the self - similar structure of eq .",
    "( see the supplementary information for more details ) .",
    "if the conditional rates are not self - similar , there remains a dependence on the main shock magnitude @xmath15 that should be detectable in plots like that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ou ] . by looking at groups of etas conditional rates with the same @xmath45 and increasing @xmath15 s ,",
    "we observe systematic decreases ( see the supplementary information ) .",
    "the following estimator quantifies the trend with @xmath15 : for each time @xmath9 and each @xmath45 we have performed a linear fit of the log - log trend of @xmath101 vs @xmath15 .",
    "this yields a slope @xmath102 , which is supposed to be the same for all @xmath45 s and all @xmath9 s .",
    "hence the average slope @xmath103 is an indicator of the departure from self - similarity in the data . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](b ) we can see that , both for the data from southern california and for the self - similar model , the indicator @xmath104 in the range @xmath105 day , while at later times the statistics is not sufficient to perform its reliable estimate . for the etas models ,",
    "the expected value @xmath106 is fairly well detected as well .",
    "we also find that self - similar behavior in the etas model can not typically be induced by stai : if stai is introduced via one of the typical relations  @xcite , our procedure continues to detect the absence of self - similarity @xmath107 ( fig .  [ fig:3](b ) ) .",
    "see also the additional analysis in the supplementary information .",
    "thus , the comparison with synthetic data shows that our analysis scheme is sensible enough to detect self - similar behavior in the conditional ou rates , corroborating that the conditional triggering rates in southern california are indeed self - similar .",
    "in summary , we have described a natural generalization of the ou relation that embodies self - similarity for event - event triggering in crackling noise . from a conceptual point of view , this provides some closure and an important piece in our understanding of event - event triggering where energy , distance and time appear in several scale - free empirical relations , either singularly ( e.g.  the gr relation ) or combined together .",
    "it has also profound consequences for probabilistic forecasting of aftershocks as well as modeling , as it implies that synthetic catalogs of relevant examples of crackling noise , including earthquakes , should be generated with algorithms reproducing the observed self - similarity .",
    "an important challenge for the future is to understand its physical origin , possibly with the help of lab experiments  @xcite .",
    "to test the validity of the self - similar ou relation , we analyze the relocated high - resolution southern california catalog  @xcite . we consider all local earthquakes with magnitude @xmath108 from 1982 to 2011 ( 101991 events ) .",
    "we identify triggering relations between events and define aftershocks using the established methodology described in refs .",
    "the method quantifies the correlation between an event @xmath109 and a following event @xmath110 via the expression @xmath111 which estimates the expected number of events in the space - time window spanned by @xmath109 and @xmath110 with magnitude larger or equal to @xmath112 . here",

    "further details on the methodology can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .      for our analysis of triggering rates , we focus only on directly triggered events , namely we do not consider aftershocks of aftershocks . to obtain sufficient statistics , rates for all events in a given small magnitude range are stacked and averaged . in particular ,",

    "moreover , @xmath192 in eq .   is assumed to follow the proposed self - similar generalization of the omori - utsu relation : @xmath193 the self - similarity is captured by the fact that @xmath27 is now a function of the magnitude of the triggered event , @xmath2 , and of the magnitude of the trigger , @xmath112 , such that @xmath194 only depends on the magnitude difference @xmath195 .",

    "all events generated in this way may then give rise to their own aftershocks , and the iteration of this procedure ends when no event within the time span of the catalog remains to be processed .",
    "a final time - ranking yields the catalog .",
    "note that the aftershocks gr relation with @xmath204 is implicitly generated through the previous procedure .    for generating synthetic catalogs with the self - similar aftershock model",

    "due to upper magnitude cut - off and the choice of the parameters , the branching ratio is less than one , making the process sub - critical  @xcite . yet , the catalog turns out to be composed mostly of aftershocks ( @xmath212% ) .",

    "the rates decrease with increasing main shock magnitude , see an example in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex - ss](a ) . in the figure",
    "one can also see that the detection procedure is precise within about @xmath154@xmath215 hours from the main shock , then it does not display a clear scaling anymore , partly due to poorer statistics in the tails of the decay .",
    "this feature is to some degree also present in the catalog generated with the self - similar model , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex - ss](b ) .",
    "more importantly , this figure clearly indicates that the self - similar behavior is detected , as there is no significant trend in the curves for increasing @xmath15 .",

    "as in many other studies ( e.g. , refs  @xcite ) , the formula we adopt to mimic short - term aftershock incompleteness ( stai ) in the etas catalogs follows the trend of stai reported by  @xcite .",
    "events after each event @xmath109 of magnitude @xmath216 are removed from the catalog if their magnitude is below a threshold value @xmath217 that depends both on @xmath15 and on the time lag @xmath9 after event @xmath109 .",
    "this threshold is given by @xmath218 the visual inspection of the conditional omori rates for the etas-1 catalog with stai ( fig .",

    "1(a ) of the main text : for increasing @xmath31 , the maximum rate first increases and then decreases such that no scaling collapse is possible .",
    "this is also true for the etas-3 catalog ( fig .",

    "the absence of a scaling collapse is not surprising since stai as described by eq",
    ".   should not affect foreshock - main shock pairs and it should only minimally affect main shock - aftershock pairs with small magnitude differences . in principle the above equation for stai might entail also a form of self - similarity ( as @xmath9 scales as @xmath220 ) that could generate @xmath27 values artificially depending on @xmath214 , similar to what we observe in south california .",
    "this is , however , not the case : not only are there still significant variations independent of @xmath31 as follows from fig .  3 of the main text but also figs .",

    "most importantly , the integrated rates inherit the self - similarity with respect to @xmath75 : magnitudes enter in ( [ hyp ] ) only through the combination @xmath226 .",
    "a consequence is that , for example , the rate of aftershocks with magnitude @xmath227 of a main shock with @xmath228 is the same of aftershock with magnitude @xmath229 of a main shock with @xmath230 , because @xmath231 in both cases .",
