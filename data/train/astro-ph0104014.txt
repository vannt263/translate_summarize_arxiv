    "galaxy clusters are the largest virialized objects in the universe and should be useful cosmological probe since the properties of clusters are considered to depend on cosmological parameters and to reflect the structure formation history .",
    "galaxy clusters contain a diffuse hot gas which emits x - rays via thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "the x - ray temperature and luminosity functions of clusters and their evolution have been used to determine the density of the universe and the amplitude of the rms density fluctuation .",
    "if there exist unique mass - temperature ( @xmath1 ) and mass - luminosity ( @xmath2 ) relations , one can predict x - ray temperature and luminosity functions of clusters at redshift @xmath3 from a theoretical mass function .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate into correlations among physical quantities of clusters and examine if such unique relations exist .",
    "recently , @xcite have found that clusters at low redshifts ( @xmath4 ) form a plane ( the fundamental plane ) in the three dimensional space ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , where @xmath8 is the central gas density , and @xmath9 is the core radius of clusters . the data on the plane still have a correlation and form a band on the plane .",
    "the observed relation @xmath10 turns out to be the cross section of the band normal to the major axis .",
    "the existence of the fundamental plane implies that the clusters form a two - parameter family , suggesting that the physical quantities of clusters are determined by the halo mass and density at the time of their formation and that no unique mass - temperature or mass - luminosity relation exists @xcite .",
    "in fact , using @xmath11-body simulations , @xcite found that the structure of clusters is related to their formation epoch , although they claimed that the clusters are a one - parameter family by assuming a unique relation between the mass and formation redshift . in this paper , motivated by the finding of the fundamental plane",
    ", we present a formulation of statistics of clusters in the context of hierarchical structure formation theory taking account of formation epoch distribution .",
    "so far , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ps ) mass function has been widely used to calculate temperature and luminosity functions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although ps mass function provides the number of dark halos at a given time , it does not contain information about the formation time of halos .",
    "thus , a conventional way to compute the temperature and luminosity functions is simply to assume that the formation time is the same as the observed time .",
    "since in this case clusters form a one - parameter family about the mass , an extension of ps theory is necessary to investigate the two - parameter nature of clusters , taking account of the effect of the formation epoch distribution . using the merger probabilities in an extended press & schechter clustering model @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter lc ) derived a formation epoch distribution function in an enlightening way , although lc did not calculate predictions of x - ray luminosity and temperature functions .",
    "the formation time in their model is defined by that time when the halo mass becomes half that at the observed epoch and this definition does not discriminate between tiny and notable relative mass capture , or between accretion and merger . in the hierarchical clustering scenario , low - mass objects successively merge with one another to build up ever more massive objects",
    ". however , major deviations from equilibrium and subsequent relaxation take place only when halos of comparable masses merge , while tiny mass captures have little effect on the capturing halos .",
    "so , it is desirable to devise such formulations . @xcite",
    "have attempted to describe the formation and destruction of halos within the extended ps prescription by discriminating between accretion and merger .",
    "they define the halo formation and destruction rates and define the formation epoch distribution by utilizing the survival probability .",
    "although they predict various statistical properties of x - ray clusters , they assume an empirical relation between temperature and luminosity in such predictions , which is not satisfactory from our point of view .    in this paper , we adopt another model of the formation epoch distribution proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ssm ) .",
    "they developed a modification of the extended ps model that differentiates merger from accretion and define the formation epoch as the epoch of the last major merger by utilizing the empirical mass - density correlation obtained by @xmath11-body simulations . following this formalism ,",
    "we can obtain not only formation time distribution but also the halo mass at the formation time . in order to obtain statistics of galaxy clusters , we assume that the halo mass and density at its last major merger determine the structure of clusters .",
    "the temperature and luminosity of galaxy clusters are calculated in terms of the halo mass and density at the formation without resorting to empirical relations . on the basis of these prescriptions ,",
    "we construct a simple scaling model of x - ray clusters and calculate @xmath12 distribution , the temperature and luminosity functions .",
    "since it is well known that a simple scaling model between gas and dark matter results in an @xmath12 relation different from observations @xcite , we also investigate a simple preheating model . the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the formulation of statistics is presented in  [ formulation ] .",
    "the x - ray cluster model is constructed in  [ x - ray ] .",
    "the results and discussion are described in  [ results ] .",
    "in this subsection , we summarize the ssm formalism . to follow the formation and evolution of halos , ssm used a modified version of the extended ps clustering model ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; lc ) and made a schematic distinction between minor and major mergers by defining the formation of a halo as the last major merger it experienced .",
    "this definition does not affect the abundance of halos at a given time , although it affects the description of their growth .",

    "therefore , @xmath35 in equation ( [ eq : m_f ] ) is an approximation to the mean formation mass of true distribution .",
    "although we ignore this scatter for the sake of simplicity , it could be estimated by using the algorithm given in @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate two cosmological models ( scdm and lcdm ) . in table",

    "figure [ dist ] shows the formation time distributions ( eq . [ [ eq : distssm ] ] ) for the scdm and lcdm models for several values of the present halo mass . since in the lcdm model",
    "the universe is in the accelerated expanding stage at @xmath43 , the growth of density fluctuation has stopped .",
    "thus , the slope of the formation time distribution in the lcdm model is less steep in comparison with the scdm model at @xmath44 ( figure [ dist ] ) .",
    "figure [ mass ] shows halo masses at its formation time ( eq . [",
    "[ eq : m_f ] ] ) for the halo with the present mass of @xmath45 .",
    "note that , in the ps formalism , there is no distinction between merger and accretion .",
    "any mass capture is regarded as merger , that is , @xmath46 .",
    "consequently , the formation time distribution is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is dirac s delta function .      in the ssm formalism , the mass function of dark halos at a fixed epoch is given by the ps mass function .",
    "on the other hand , for a given mass , the dark halos take a range of formation time as depicted by equation ( [ eq : distssm ] ) .",
    "thus , dark halos form a two - parameter family .",
    "ssm found that the characteristic density and the scale radius of a halo at the present epoch are proportional to the critical density of the universe and the virial radius of the halo at the formation time @xmath49 respectively .",
    "this means that , between major mergers , halos gradually grow through the accretion of surrounding matter while keeping the central part unchanged .",
    "considering the two - parameter family nature of clusters , we thus assume that the physical quantities of clusters of galaxies are represented by the mass and the virial density at the their formation time or the last major merger . on this assumption ,",

    "we assume that the gas mass fraction of clusters @xmath93 is the same as the cosmic baryon ratio @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the density parameter of baryon and we adopt @xmath96 to be consistent with the primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "first , we examine the case where the gas temperature @xmath1 is equal to the virial temperature @xmath61 . in this case , the structure is self - similar and we call this model the scaling model .",
    "we calculate the temperature and luminosity functions based on the ssm formalism ( eq . [ [ eq : distssm ] ] ) and compare them with those based on the ps formalism ( eq . [ [ eq : distps ] ] ) . the temperature function and their redshift evolution",
    "are shown in figure  [ nt ] , where thin lines and symbols denote ssm and ps predictions , respectively . as is seen",
    ", there is little difference between the predictions of the two formalisms .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "when we take account of the distribution of the formation time , physical quantities of clusters are affected by two factors .",
    "first , if the object formed earlier , its virial density becomes larger ( eq . [ [ eq : density_c ] ] ) .",
    "second , if the object formed earlier , its mass at the formation becomes smaller for a given mass at @xmath57 ( figure  [ mass ] ) .",
    "gas temperature depends on the virial density and mass at the formation time as @xmath97 , and these two factors tend to cancel out .",
    "this behavior of temperature function is the same as that of previous studies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this feature is common to both the cosmological models we investigate .",
    "the @xmath36 dependence of temperature , @xmath98 , is shown in figure [ t - z ] , which explicitly shows that @xmath1 is roughly constant for @xmath99 .",
    "note that @xcite also finds no evidence for a correlation between x - ray temperature and formation time in his simulation of x - ray clusters .",
    "the difference between scdm model and lcdm model is mainly caused by the dependence on the time evolution of virial density ( eq . [ [ eq : density_c ] ] ) .",
    "the luminosity function and their redshift evolution are shown in figure [ nl ] , where thin lines and symbols denote ssm and ps predictions , respectively . as is seen , ssm formalism predicts larger number density than ps formalism and for the ssm formalism , there is little evolution even in scdm model in contrast with the ps formalism .",
    "this result is different from that of the temperature function , because of the difference between the dependence of temperature and luminosity on the virial density and mass at the formation .",
    "since @xmath100 , the luminosity depends more strongly on the virial density than the temperature .",
    "the @xmath36 dependence of luminosity , @xmath101 , is presented in figure [ l - z ] , which shows that @xmath2 increases with @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , earlier formed dense clusters contribute to the increase of the luminosity function shown in figure [ nl ] .",
    "moreover , the increase of @xmath2 with @xmath36 explains that there is little evolution of the luminosity function from @xmath102 to @xmath57 both in scdm and lcdm universes .",
    "since the growth of density fluctuations in scdm model is more rapid than that in lcdm model , one might think that the luminosity function in scdm model should evolve rapidly .",
    "however , the present result implies that it is not the case if we consider the effect of the distribution in the formation redshift .",
    "thus , recent observational evidence for little evolution of luminosity function @xcite does not necessarily mean that scdm model is disfavored against lcdm model .",
    "it is also noted that if we consider the effect of formation epoch distribution , smaller value of @xmath42 is needed to reproduce observations compared with the ps formalism .",
    "when we compare the predictions with observations , one should note that the amplitude of temperature and luminosity functions can be adjusted by changing @xmath42 so that we are concerned with their shape . in figure",
    "[ nt ] , the thick line is the best power - law fit to the observed low redshift temperature function obtained by @xcite .",
    "the predicted shape of the temperature function is consistent with observations both for scdm and lcdm models , although agreement is better for lcdm model . in figure [ nl ]",
    "the thick line is the best fitted schechter function to the observed bolometric luminosity function within @xmath103 obtained by @xcite .",
    "the predicted shape is much steeper than the observations both for scdm and lcdm models .",
    "this is another representation of the well - known discrepancy of the @xmath12 relation .",
    "next , we investigate the distribution on the @xmath12 relation . for several values of @xmath104 $ ] , we plot iso - density contours on the @xmath12 plane in figure [ l - t ] . from the relations",
    "@xmath105 and @xmath106 , the luminosity behaves as @xmath107 . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , in the ps formalism it is assumed that the observed redshift of a cluster is equal to the formation redshift ( @xmath108 ) . thus , most of the observed clusters ( @xmath44 ) have nearly the same virial density @xmath109 and their physical quantities depend only on mass . therefore ,",
    "in the ps formalism , clusters form a one - parameter family , which is shown by the straight line .",
    "on the other hand , in the ssm formalism , the virial densities take a wide range of values because @xmath52 depends on the formation redshift .",
    "thus , clusters form a two - parameter family .",
    "the scatter of the @xmath12 relation shown in figure  [ l - t ] reflects the dispersion of the halo formation time .",
    "@xcite also pointed this out .",
    "since @xmath52 tends to be distributed more widely for smaller clusters , the scatter of @xmath12 relation is larger at lower @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the slope of @xmath12 relation in the ssm formalism becomes shallower than @xmath110 .",
    "this is , however , in conflict with the observed correlation @xmath111 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as long as we assume that the ratio of the gas density of the core to the virial density is constant , this tendency persists . to resolve this discrepancy ,",
    "this ratio should vary such that less massive clusters have smaller baryon fraction at the cluster core from which much of the x - ray emission originates @xcite .",
    "many authors have attributed such behavior to preheating of intracluster gas @xcite , in which intracluster gas had already been heated before the cluster formed . on the other hand",
    ", some authors claimed that intracluster gas is heated after the formation of the cluster @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite argued that cooling of gas and the resultant galaxy formation are sufficient to explain to lower the gas fraction in small clusters and groups without additional heating .",
    "since these models give qualitatively similar gas distributions , we will adopt a preheating model in the next subsection .",
    "it is to be noted future observations may discriminate the heating or galaxy formation models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we examine the effects of preheating using a simple model of @xcite based on the models of @xcite .",
    "they combine effects of shock heating and preheating so that the gas temperature is higher than the virial temperature such that @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a given preshock temperature . in this model , @xmath69 is given by @xmath114 if @xmath113 is not negligible compared to @xmath61 , @xmath69 becomes smaller , which means that hot gas expands and the gas density in the core decreases under the condition that the total gas mass of the cluster is constant . as a result ,",
    "x - ray luminosity becomes smaller , which results in a steeper @xmath12 relation .",
    "comparison with observations of clusters suggests that the preheated temperature , @xmath113 , is about @xmath115 @xcite . here",

    "thus , we can calculate the @xmath36 dependences of the temperature and luminosity functions using the formulation constructed in  [ tl ] .",
    "the @xmath36 dependence of temperature , @xmath98 , and that of the luminosity , @xmath101 , are shown by thick lines in figures [ t - z ] and [ l - z ] , respectively .",

    "iso - density contours on the @xmath12 plane are plotted in figure [ l - tp ] .",
    "because of the preheating , the gas temperature is raised and the gas expands compared to the case without preheating .",

    "the luminosity in the preheating model is larger than that in the scaling model in spite of preheating .",
