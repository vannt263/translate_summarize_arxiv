    "they suggested that the large polarization of irs v-1 was due to illumination by irs v-2 or v-3 .",

    "no additional ir - invisible sources seem to be necessary to interpret our polarization data .",
    "figures [ fig2](b ) and [ fig2](d ) show that en - a1 to en - a3 and wn - a2 have more than 50 % polarization , which implies that these knots are not self - luminous in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands .",

    "it has been suggested that there is a close relationship between infrared reflection nebulosity ( irn ) and co bipolar outflow ( yamashita et al .",
    "polarimetry toward the central infrared source of co bipolar outflows shows a polarization perpendicular to the outflow direction ( sato et al .",
    "viewed at low spatial resolution , the extension of irn tends to be consistent with that of co outflow ( tamura et al .",
    "1990 ) . in this ngc 6334 v region ,",
    "fischer et al . (",
    "1982 ) have shown a co outflow and straw , hyland & mcgregor ( 1989 ) found evidence that this outflow has triggered further star - formation activity via interaction with the ambient cloud material .",
    "thus we suggest that en - a and wn - a are irne which are the walls of molecular outflows . a position - velocity co map centered on irs v-3 of fischer et al .",
    "( 1982 ) showed that two peaks of blueshifted emission were located in the vicinity and both sides of irs v-3 , which consistents with our results .",
    "our polarimetric results imply that there are two independent outflows in ngc 6334 v region .",
    "among the six ir sources , the outflow source kdj 4 which coincides with 2 cm continuum source r e-3 is identified to be a b2 zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) star ( rengarajan & ho 1996 ; kraemer et al .",
    "another outflow source wn - a1 , however , is not associated with a radio continuum source ( rengarajan & ho 1996 ) , but with ( part of ) an mid - ir source kdj 3 and the ammonia clump .",
    "therefore , we suspect this to be a massive embedded yso with a dense core .",
    "en - a1 is also associated with a radio coninuum source ( r e-2 ) , thus suggested to be a b - type zams star ( jackson & kraemer 1999 ) . however , in  [ 3.3 ] , we mentioned that en - a1 was a reflection nebula . since there is no clear change of near - ir polarization pattern over the  self - luminous ",
    "star en - a1 , we suggest that the scattered light from kdj 4 is more dominant than the brightness of en - a1 at near - ir .",
    "by contrast , en - a2 and wn - a2 ( kdj 2 and part of kdj 3 , respectively ) are not associated with radio coninuum sources ( rengarajan & ho 1996 ) and not temperature peaks ( kraemer et al .",
    "1999 ) , therefore are knots of the near - ir reflection nebula .",
    "similarly , en - a3 seems to be a simply peak of the near - ir reflection nebula .",
    "therefore , our observations , combined with previous mid - ir and radio observations , have revealed the presence of at least three clustered ysos in the ngc 6334 v , of which two ysos are probably powering massive outflows .",
    "further high spatial resolution co observations should be undertaken to reveal the kinematics of these outflows .",
    "we conducted subaru / ciao direct and polarimetric imaging of the ngc 6334 v nebulae ; eastern nebula a ( en - a ) and western nebula a ( wn - a ) , with a high resolution of 0@xmath03 .",
    "we detected two red near - ir sources ( wn - a1 and a2 ) near the position of mid - ir source kdj 3 .",
    "we found that en - a and wn - a are illuminated by the different infrared sources of kdj 4 and wn - a1 , respectively .",
    "combined with previous mid - ir and radio observations , we suggest that the outflow sources of kdj 4 and wn - a1 are a b - type zams star and a massive embedded yso with a dense core , respectively .",
    "in addition , fine structures of both nebulae were detected ; in particular , we found that the western nebula has a multi - shell structure .",
    "the high levels of polarization of en - a2 and wn - a2 in the @xmath2 band suggest that these are not self - luminous , but rather knots of the reflection nebulae .",
