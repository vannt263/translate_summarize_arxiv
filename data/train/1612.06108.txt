    "in recent years , metallic nanowires have attracted a major attention for research due to their unique properties and potential applications in future nano / micro electro - mechanical systems .",
    "the nanowires suspended between two electrodes are found to exhibit the electron transport properties similar to that of a quantum wire which shows a quantized conductance , and it has gained importance in fundamental physics and in electronic device technology as a quantized conductance atomic switch @xcite . under tensile loading , if the cross - section area of nanowire reduces to that of a few - atom thickness prior to failure , it exhibits conductance in multiples of @xmath2 , where e is the electron charge and h is the planck s constant @xcite . in view of this correlation between the structure and the conductance ,",
    "it is important to understand the formation and the stability of the long atomic chains during deformation of metallic nanowires . further , the 1-d structures can also act as ideal systems to understand the low - dimensional physics .    in the past ,",
    "the formation of the linear , pentagonal and other multi - shell atomic chains have been observed during the deformation of many fcc nanowires and the formation of all these atomic chains is associated with the quantized conductance @xcite .",
    "the long linear atomic chains have been observed experimentally during the stretching of au and cu nanowires @xcite .",
    "the linear atomic chains display conductance close to @xmath3 . using transmission electron microscopy , gonzalez et al .",
    "@xcite observed the formation of pentagonal chains during the stretching of cu nanowires which exhibited the conductance of 4.5@xmath3 . during tension",
    "deformation , the au nanowires have been found to exhibit a zigzag shape , which remains stable even if the load is relieved @xcite .",
    "similarly , kondo and takayanagi @xcite synthesized the gold nanowires with diameter as small as 0.6 nm having length of 6 nm . using high - resolution electron microscopy",
    ", it has been found that these nanowires have a multi - shell structure composed of coaxial tubes @xcite .",
    "each tube consists of helical atom rows coiled round the wire axis .",
    "the structures such as linear atomic chain ( monatomic , diatomic ) , pentagonal , two - shell , three - shell and helical multi - shell structures have also been predicted theoretically in ultra thin al and pb metallic nanowires @xcite and also in zno and si semiconductor nanowires using molecular dynamics simulations @xcite . in al and pb metallic nanowires , it has been postulated that the competition between optimal internal packing and minimal surface energy is the main driving force behind these morphological structures at small size @xcite .",
    "however , out of all these structures , the formation of pentagonal atomic chains is one of the fascinating observations as it exhibits a five - fold symmetry with respect to the nanowire axis and does not correspond to any of the 14 bravais lattices .",
    "generally , the pentagonal structure is not observed in 2-d or 3-d structures as it is incompatible with the translational symmetry .",
    "however , as mentioned above , the strong evidence of pentagonal structures have been found experimentally in 1-d structures , such as ultra - thin cu nanowires @xcite . in agreement with experimental observations ,",

    "other than na , the pentagonal structure has not been reported in any other metallic bcc nanowires either by experiments or atomistic simulations .",

    "the length ( l ) was twice the cross section width .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were chosen along the nanowire length direction , while the other directions were kept free in order to mimic an infinitely long nanowire .",
    "after the initial construction of nanowire , energy minimization was performed by conjugate gradient method to obtain a stable structure .",
    "velocity verlet algorithm was used to integrate the equations of motion with a time step of 5 femto seconds .",
    "finally , the model system was thermally equilibrated to a required temperature in canonical ensemble with a nose - hoover thermostat . for each nanowire cross section width , the simulations have been performed at different temperatures ranging from 10 to 900 k. following thermal equilibration , the tensile deformation was performed at a constant strain rate of @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 along the axis of the nanowire .",
    "the strain rate considered during deformation is significantly higher than the typical experimental strain rates .",
    "this is due to the inherent timescale limitations from md simulations . here",

    "the transition temperature increases linearly with increase in nanowire size .",
    "it is important to point out that the pentagonal atomic chains are not formed at low temperatures of 10 and 100 k as well as nanowire size larger than 2.83 nm .",
    "the observed formation of pentagonal atomic chains promoted by small nanowire size and higher temperatures is in agreement with those reported for fcc and hcp nanowires @xcite .",

    "the combined effect of temperature and strain rate on the formation of linear atomic chains in zno nanowires has been explained based on the arrhenius model @xcite .",
    "further , the observation of transition temperature as a function of size in bcc fe nanowires appears to be significant , since there is no such transition temperature established yet in either fcc @xcite or hcp nanowires @xcite .",

    "in small size nanowires ( d = 0.807 nm ) , the long pentagonal atomic chains consisted of as many as 25 pentagonal rings compared to 13 rings in large size nanowire with d = 1.615 nm at 600 k. the observed long pentagonal atomic chains remain stable during the deformation and contribute to large failure strains as much as 265% in small size nanowires .",
