    "the well - known hyperbolic dehn surgery theorem due to thurston ( * ? ? ? * theorem 5.8.2 . ) says that each hyperbolic knot ( i.e. , a knot with the complement admitting a hyperbolic structure ) admits only finitely many dehn surgeries yielding non - hyperbolic manifolds . in view of this , such finitely many exceptions are called _",
    "exceptional surgeries_.    to achieve a complete classification of exceptional surgeries on hyperbolic knots in the 3-sphere @xmath2 would be one of the most important but challenging problems in the study of 3-manifolds , and also in knot theory . toward the ultimate goal to this problem ,",
    "some of the partial solutions have been obtained .",
    "for example , a classification of exceptional surgeries on hyperbolic two - bridge knots was obtained in @xcite , and quite recently , that obtained for hyperbolic pretzel knots in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider exceptional surgery on hyperbolic alternating knots in @xmath2 , one of the most well - known classes of knots .",
    "a knot in @xmath2 is called _ alternating _ if it admits a diagram with alternatively arranged over - crossings and under - crossings running along it .",
    "the main theorem of this paper is :    [ mainthm ] let @xmath3 be a hyperbolic alternating knot in the @xmath4-sphere . if @xmath3 admits a non - trivial exceptional surgery , then @xmath3 is equivalent to an arborescent knot .",
    "the definition of arborescent knots together with other definitions and background is delayed until @xmath5[sect : preliminaries ] .",
    "recently , exceptional surgeries on ( both alternating and non - alternating ) arborescent knots have been almost classified .",
    "together with such known results , we provide a complete classification of exceptional surgeries on alternating knots as a corollary of our theorem .",

    "the proof of this corollary is given in section [ sec.3 ] .",
    "the last assertion immediately follows from the classification above , which gives an affirmative solution for alternating knots to the famous gordon s conjecture .",
    "it was shown in @xcite based on @xcite that any hyperbolic alternating knot in @xmath2 has at most 10 exceptional surgeries , and recently , lackenby and meyerhoff @xcite proved in general that any hyperbolic knot in any closed 3-manifold has at most 10 exceptional surgeries .",
    "on the other hand , as stated in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 1.77 ) , gordon conjectured that only the figure - eight knot attains the maximal , that is 10 , but the methods used in the above papers could not prove this .",
    "we remark that our proof of theorem [ mainthm ] is computer - aided . in section [ sec.4 ] , we will give an outline of our proof , and , in particular , we will clarify where we used computer in the proof .",
    "actually , due to @xcite , we have only finitely many ( but a huge number of ) links so that theorem [ mainthm ] follows from the complete classification of certain types of exceptional surgeries on them .",
    "thus our task is to investigate the surgeries on these finite number of links .    in section [ sec.symmetry ]",
    ", we will discuss how to reduce the number of the links which we have to check .",
    "as is explained in section 6 , by computer - aided caluculations , we have a potential procedure to rigorously verify that a given link admits no non - trivial exceptional surgeries . however applying it for all the links obtained by using @xcite only is computationally expensive .",
    "therefore we give a number of observations to reduce the number of links we need to check , which we estimated to be in the millions .",
    "first , we consider symmetries of the links and the other diagrammatic arguments in order to reduce this number . to further reduce the number of links and the number of components for some of the links , we applied some techniques and results of @xcite , which use essential laminations in the link exteriors .",
    "even with this reductions , the size of the computation is outside the scope of a personal computer .",
    "as noted above , the verification needed for each link is an involved process . to be more specific",
    ", we have about 30,000 links to investigate , and for each single link , we have to apply the procedure developed in @xcite recursively .",
    "in fact , in the worst case , we have to apply the procedure more than 18,000 times .",
    "therefore , we ran our computations on the super - computer , `` tsubame '' , housed at tokyo institute of technology .",
    "the result of all the computations verifies that none of the links admit unexpected non - trivial exceptional surgeries .    in section [ sec.codes ]",
    ", we will explain our main code ` fef.py ` ( short for ind xceptional illings ) that rigorously ensures the non - existence of non - trivial exceptional surgeries of certain type .",

    "our program is essentially based on the technique developed in @xcite .",
    "however , to obtain mathematically rigorous computations , we improved their codes using verified numerical analysis based on interval arithmetics .",
    "some fundamentals about such methods will be given in appendix [ ape.a ] .",
    "the key step to show that the links have no exceptional surgeries is to prove the hyperbolicity of a given manifold rigorously .",
    "a technique to prove the hyperbolicity via computer has been developed in @xcite by the team containing the authors of this paper .",
    "actually our computer assisted part of the proof of theorem [ mainthm ] can be adapted to provide the final step needed to classify all exceptional surgeries on hyperbolic arborescent knots . in appendix",
    "[ ape.b ] , applying our method of obtaining a complete classification of exceptional surgeries on a given hyperbolic link , we show that the montesinos knots @xmath0 with @xmath1 have no non - trivial exceptional surgeries .",
    "this gives the final step in a complete classification of exceptional surgeries on arborescent knots .",
    "we here remark that prime alternating knots are known to be all hyperbolic except for @xmath29-torus knots , that is , knots isotoped to the @xmath29-curves on the standardly embedded torus in @xmath2",

    "by a _ dehn surgery _ on a knot @xmath3 , we mean the following operation to create a new @xmath4-manifold from a given one and a given knot : first remove an open tubular neighborhood of @xmath3 to obtain the _ exterior _ @xmath30 of @xmath3 , and glue a solid torus @xmath31 back via a boundary homeomorphism @xmath32 .",
    "we say the isotopy class of each non - trivial unoriented simple closed curve in @xmath33 is _",
    "slope_. we pay special attention to the slope @xmath34 that is identified to the isotopy class of curves in @xmath35 that bounds a disk in @xmath31 . in this context",
    ", we call @xmath34 the _ surgery slope _ ( see @xcite for further details and background on dehn surgery ) . when @xmath3 is a knot in @xmath2 , by using the standard meridian - longitude system , slopes on @xmath33 are parametrized by @xmath36 . for example",
    ", the meridian of @xmath3 corresponds to @xmath37 and the longitude to @xmath38 .",
    "we thus denote by @xmath6 the 3-manifold obtained by dehn surgery on a knot @xmath3 along a slope corresponding to a rational number @xmath7 . by the _",
    "trivial _ dehn surgery on @xmath3 in @xmath2 , we mean the dehn surgery on @xmath3 along the meridional slope @xmath37 .",
    "thus , it yields @xmath2 again , which is obviously exceptional , when @xmath3 is hyperbolic .",
    "we say that a dehn surgery on @xmath3 in @xmath2 is _ integral _ if it is along an integral slope .",
    "this means that the curve representing the surgery slope runs longitudinally once .",
    "we also recall a classification of exceptional surgeries . as a consequence of the famous geometrization conjecture , raised by thurston in (",
    "* , question 1 ) , and established by perelman s works , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , all closed orientable @xmath4-manifolds are classified as : reducible ( i.e. , containing 2-spheres not bounding 3-balls ) , toroidal ( i.e. , containing incompressible tori ) , seifert fibered ( i.e. , foliated by circles ) , or hyperbolic ( i.e. , admitting a complete riemannian metric with constant sectional curvature @xmath39 ) . see @xcite for a survey .",
    "thus , exceptional surgeries are also divided into three types ; reducible ( i.e. , yielding a reducible manifold ) , toroidal ( i.e. , yielding a toroidal manifold ) , or seifert fibered ( i.e. , yielding a seifert fibered manifold ) .",
    "we here introduce some notions for knots that we use in this paper .",
    "a _ bridge index _ of a knot in @xmath2 is defined as the minimal number of local maxima ( or local minima ) up to ambient isotopy .",
    "thus , a knot with bridge index @xmath40 is called a _ two - bridge knot_. since two - bridge knots are alternating , due to the result of menasco showed @xcite , a two - bridge knot is hyperbolic unless it is a @xmath29-torus knot .    here",
    "we recall definitions of an arborescent knot and its type .",
    "see @xcite for full details . by a _ tangle _",
    ", we mean a pair with a 3-ball and properly embedded 1-manifolds . from two arcs of rational slope drawn on the boundary of a pillowcase - shaped 3-ball",
    ", one can obtain a tangle , which is called a _ rational tangle_. a tangle obtained by putting rational tangles together in a horizontal way is called a _",
    "montesinos tangle_. an _ arborescent tangle _ is then defined as a tangle that can be obtained by summing several montesinos tangles together in an arbitrary order .",
    "suppose that a knot @xmath3 in @xmath2 is obtained by closing a tangle @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath41 is a montesinos tangle , then we call @xmath3 a _ montesinos knot _ , and if @xmath41 is an arborescent tangle , then we call @xmath3 an _ arborescent knot_.    the number of rational tangles forming the corresponding montesinos tangle is called the _ length _ of the montesinos knot .",
    "it is seen that prime montesinos knots with length at most two are all two - bridge knots .",
    "thus , they are all alternating . on the other hand , in general",
    ", montesinos knots are non - alternating if the lengths are at least three .    in @xcite",
    ", wu divided all arborescent knots into three types : _ type i _ knots - two - bridge knots or montesinos knots of length 3 , _ type ii _",
    "knots - the union of two montesinos tangles , each of which is formed by two rational tangles corresponding to @xmath42 and a non - integer , and all the other arborescent knots are _ type iii_.    we denote by @xmath43 a montesinos knot constructed from rational tangles corresponding to rational numbers @xmath44 . in particular , @xmath45 with integers @xmath46 is called a _ pretzel knot _ of @xmath47-strands .",
    "let @xmath3 be a hyperbolic alternating knot in @xmath2 .",

    "suppose that @xmath6 is toroidal .",
    "then @xmath6 is not seifert fibered , shown by the first author with jong @xcite .",
    "moreover , as a consequence of the argument used in the classification of toroidal surgeries on alternating knots obtained by patton @xcite and boyer and zhang ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.1 ) , we see that @xmath3 and @xmath7 is a pair listed in the statement of corollary  [ cor ] .",
    "alternatively , this observation also follows from our theorem [ mainthm ] , together with the classifications of toroidal surgeries on two - bridge knots and other arborescent knots obtained by brittenham and wu @xcite and wu @xcite , @xcite .",

    "any hyperbolic arborescent knot of type ii or type iii can not admit a small seifert fibered surgery by wu in @xcite , @xcite .",

    ", we see that all the montesinos knots of length three admitting small seifert fibered surgeries are non - alternating as follows .",
    "each of the knots can be checked that it admits reduced montesinos diagrams which is non - alternating . then the diagram is a minimal diagram , since if a montesinos link admits an @xmath47-crossing reduced montesinos diagram , then it can not be projected with fewer than @xmath47 crossings , as shown in ( * ? ?",
    "* theorem 10 ) .",
    "however , a non - alternating projection of a prime alternating link can not be minimal ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem b ) , and so , the knots considered above are non - alternating . finally we see that the montesinos knots @xmath0 with @xmath1 are non - alternating in the same way .",
    "this completes the proof of corollary [ cor ] .    in appendix",

    "then the perelman s affirmative solution to the geometrization conjecture guarantees that `` non - hyperbolike '' is equivalent to non - hyperbolic , i.e. , exceptional in this context .",
    "here we recall terminology used in the lemma above .",
    "let @xmath48 be a connected alternating diagram of a knot in @xmath2 , which we view as a @xmath50-valent graph embedded in @xmath51 , equipped with  under - over \" crossing information .",
    "then @xmath48 is called _ prime _ if each simple closed curve in @xmath51 intersecting @xmath48 transversely in two points divides @xmath51 into two discs , one of which contains no crossings of @xmath48 . the _ twist number _ of the diagram @xmath48 , denoted by @xmath52 , is defined as the number of _ twists _ , which are either ; maximal connected collections of bigon regions in @xmath48 arranged in a row or isolated crossings adjacent to no bigon regions .    in the case",

    "note that among the graphs in figure [ fig.graphs ] , the top 3 graphs that will be named @xmath57 are simple and 3-connected . here",
    "a graph is said to be _ simple _ if it does not have any multi edge or self loop , and _",
    "3-connected _ if there does not exist a set of @xmath40 vertices whose removal is disconnected .",

    ", we have a new regular 4-valent plane graph with fewer vertices . then the original diagram @xmath48 is obtained by replacing all of its vertices with rational tangles or montesinos tangles . repeating this procedure",
    ", we have a regular 4-valent plane graph with single vertex , from which we reconstruct the original diagram by replacing the vertex with an arborescent tangle .",
    "this means that the original @xmath48 must represent an arborescent knot , contradicting the assumption that @xmath3 is not an arborescent knot .",

    "thus @xmath48 can admit no complementary bigons .",
    "again , for example by @xcite , it is known that there is exactly one regular 4-valent plane graph , say @xmath61 , with 6 vertices without complementary bigons , which is depicted at the left of the top row in figure [ fig.graphs ] .",
    "next suppose that @xmath62 .",
    "again , for example by @xcite , it is known that there is no regular 4-valent plane graph with 7 vertices without complementary bigons .",
    "this means that , under the assumption that @xmath48 does not represent an arborescent knot , @xmath48 is obtained from @xmath61 by replacing a vertex with a vertical or a horizontal bigon . since @xmath61 is homogeneous , i.e. the graph automorphism group acts transitively on the set of vertices , it suffices to consider only one graph , say @xmath63 , which is depicted at the middle of the top row in figure [ fig.graphs ] .",

    "we define a _ knot component _ as a component of the link which is not an augmented circle .",
    "since we are only interested in _ alternating knots _ , we have some constraints .",
    "first , we only need to deal with sequences that corresponding links have one connected knot component , for otherwise after twisting we get a link rather than a knot .      given an alternating diagram the mirror image of",
    "the diagram will also be alternating .",
    "therefore after fixing the sign of the surgery slopes along the augmented circles , we may assume that the sign on the @xmath38-th component is negative .",
    "this reduces the number of cases we need to consider by a factor of two .",
    "we thus obtained the following conditions on slopes .",
    "* the slope of the augmented circle in 0-th square is @xmath90 for some @xmath91 , * the slopes of the other augmented circles are of type @xmath92 with @xmath93 , and their signs are as determined so that the resulting knot to be alternating .",
    "[ rmk.sing_crossing ] there was an ambiguity of the sign of crossings when @xmath85 .",
    "we choose the sign of such crossings so that we only need to look at slopes @xmath88 or @xmath87 with @xmath89 ranging all positive integers .",
    "thus we generate a list of links with information of the number of augmented circles which we perform surgery with negative slope , i.e. @xmath87 s with positive @xmath89 .",
    "this number is equal to the number of positive twists of the resulting alternating knots . for each link in the list we have generated , the @xmath38-th component is the knot component , @xmath94-st to @xmath74-th components are the augmented circles which will be surgered with negative slopes , and the rest will be surgered with positive slopes .    for the case of 7 and 8 twists , equivalently , the case of length 7 and 8 sequences , not only requiring knot component to be connected , we also require that , after twisting , the twist number does not decrease .",
    "for example , in the length 7 case , we require either @xmath95 or @xmath96 .",
    "for otherwise , it can readily be seen that any resulting knot after twisting has at most @xmath97 twists .",
    "we have similar conditions for the length 8 cases .",
    "this occurs if there are _ parallel _ augmented circles .",
    "here augmented circles are said to be parallel if they are mutually isotopic in the complement of knot component .",

    "we first discuss the graph @xmath61 , which corresponds to the 6 twists case .",
    "for the remainder of this section , we will denote a symmetry by its permutation on the set of tangle regions and when necessary add or subtract a number of twists .",
    "for example , the symmetries of the graph @xmath61 are as follows :      these symmetries are good enough to reduce the number of sequences in the list and are easy to implement .",
    "we implement the above procedure as ` twistlink6.py ` and by running it , we get a list with 185 links .",
