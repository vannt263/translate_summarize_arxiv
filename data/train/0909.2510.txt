    "the field of exoplanet spectroscopy has advanced rapidly since the first observations of secondary eclipse events enabled the brightness temperatures of transiting planets to be determined @xcite , thereby confirming heating due to stellar irradiation .",
    "thanks largely to the spitzer space telescope @xcite , the spectral energy distribution of a number systems has now been estimated ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "it has recently been suggested that close orbiting extrasolar giant planets ( cegps ) can be divided into two possible sub - groups , one which exhibits absorption spectra and one which exhibits emission features due to the presence of a stratosphere @xcite .",
    "individual planetary atmospheres are no doubt more complex with @xcite , for example , preferring to use parameterisations of the degree of stratospheric absorption and heat redistribution .",
    "nevertheless , hd 209458b appears to fall broadly into the latter category @xcite while the spectral energy distribution of  is found to be well fit by models where no stratosphere forms @xcite .",
    "although planetary signatures are easier to _ detect _ at mid - infrared wavelengths , _ characterisation _ of atmospheres is easier at shorter wavelengths where observational sensitivities are sufficient to probe the large amplitude signatures of species such as h@xmath0o and carbon bearing molecules .",
    "the first evidence for water and organic molecules in the atmospheres of cegps has come from space based broadband photometric observations and low resolution transit spectroscopy .",
    "while @xcite and @xcite claimed independent detections of h@xmath5o at different wavelengths , @xcite have now identified co and ch@xmath6 in transit spectra which probe the terminator of the planet hd 189733b .",
    "@xcite reported a detection of water in the dayside spectrum through spitzer space telescope observations of secondary eclipse events below .",
    "most recently nicmos / hst data have been used to infer the additional presence of co and co@xmath0 in the dayside spectra of hd 189733b ( @xcite , hereafter s09 ) .    rather than attempting to identify molecules from their broadband spectral signatures ,",
    "we present a method which attempts to identify spectral structure through a statistical examination of the many thousand individual transitions found in a typical high resolution ( r @xmath4 25,000 - 50,000 ) planetary spectrum .",
    "specifically , in order to detect the faint planetary signal , spectral deconvolution is applied to individual spectra in a timeseries in order to derive mean absorption profiles with boosted s / n ratios . modelling the phase dependent contrast ratio and radial velocity motion enables the maximum planet / star contrast ratio and velocity amplitude to be measured ( from which the true mass of the planet may also be determined ) .",
    "crucially , since the planet need not be transiting , this spectroscopic method increases the sample of planets which can potentially be studied with current instrumentation . with the aim of extending space based mid - infrared measurements of planet / star contrast ratios into the near infrared , we search for the cegp signature , manifested as h@xmath0o , co and co@xmath0 absorption in high resolution k band spectroscopic timeseries observations of ( k1v - k2v ) .",

    "this resulted in a spectral timeseries in which the s / n ratio of individual spectra varied greatly .",
    "we found that rejecting the lowest s / n frames increased the sensitivity of our method .",
    "we thus carried out a similar rejection procedure , set at an arbitrary s / n = 350 to reject the lowest s / n ratio frames which formed a distinct distribution separate from those frames which were observed in the best seeing conditions .",
    "a total of 63 frames were rejected from observations made on june 15 ( s / n ratios of the rejected frames were @xmath10 ) while none were rejected from observations made on june 22 ; a clear reflection of the more variable conditions prevailing on the first night .",

    "1 .      following the procedures outlined in @xcite and @xcite , we attempt to extract the planetary signature from timeseries spectra by removing the dominant spectral contributions ; namely the stellar spectrum and the telluric lines .",
    "a master spectrum is generated by combining all observed frames on a given night after nearest - pixel alignment of each individual order in each spectrum to minimise blurring .",
    "the master template is subtracted from each spectrum in turn after shifting , scaling and blurring / sharpening ( again on an order to order basis ) .",
    "this latter procedure is achieved by calculating the first to fourth order derivatives of the template spectrum .",
    "the master template is then scaled to each observed spectrum by using a spline with a fixed number of knots .",
    "scale factors for the derivatives are similarly calculated . a model of each observed spectrum",
    "can thus be calculated by means of a taylor expansion of the template spectrum .",
    "the procedure is described in detail in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "since we observe  at phases close to phase @xmath13 when the planet spectrum is doppler shifted on the steepest part of the radial velocity curve , the master template spectrum contains only a very weak , blurred out copy of the planetary spectrum .",
    "hence subtraction of the template does not significantly attenuate the planetary signature .",
    "the resulting residual timeseries should thus ideally only contain noise and a copy of the planetary spectrum .",
    "however , residual pattern noise remains in the subtracted timeseries .",
    "examination indicates that the dominant patterns are time variant residuals which are introduced when subtracting the scaled master template during the procedure outlined in  2.3 .",
    "although this procedure is effective at removing the stellar and telluric lines , variations between the strength of these lines throughout the night ( due to changing airmass and hence telluric strength ) are sufficient to preclude consistent results over timescales of the variations .",
    "in addition to pattern noise induced by telluric effects , noise may arise from time variable fringing effects , as found by @xcite for k band nirspec observations for example . to remove these two effects ,",
    "@xcite carried out a two stage procedure in the form of a regression and singular value decomposition filtering procedure on their spectra .",
    "our implementation of the taylor expansion algorithm , mentioned above and in detail in @xcite , is analogous to the regression step . in a similar procedure to the singular value decomposition implemented by @xcite , the remaining pattern nose can be removed by calculating the correlation matrix of the time variations in individual spectral bins for our set of residual spectra .",
    "the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix , which account for the largest fraction of the variance , are the principal components of the residual spectra . by subtracting only the principal components ,",
    "any remaining pattern noise can be further removed ( see appendix b of @xcite for further details ) .",
    "a balance must be struck between removing pattern noise and maintaining information in the residual spectra .",
    "we found that shifts of 1 - 2 pixels during a typical night of observations could be attributed to points during the night where the instrumental configuration was slightly modified to enable observations of a star for another project .",
    "we thus applied principal components analysis to continuous blocks ( i.e. between observations of the other star , where the 1 - 2 pixel shifts occurred ) of hd 189733 observations and found that 2 to 3 components were necessary to remove the remaining pattern noise in the data without attenuating the planetary signal ( see  4 ) .",
    "in order to extract the planetary signature from the corrected residual spectra , we used least squares deconvolution @xcite which requires the use of a model spectrum to describe the strengths ( normalised profile depths ) and wavelength positions of the strongest planetary opacities over the wavelength range of our observations .",
    "our implementation of the algorithm @xcite propagates errors from the input spectra and has been used in reflected light searches in the optical by @xcite and @xcite . for each residual spectrum a deconvolved profile is obtained , potentially containing a copy of the doppler shifted planetary profile which can then be detected owing to the effective boost in s / n ratio .",
    "typical boosts in s / n ratio of a few times to a few tens of times are achieved since several hundred to several thousand planetary absorption lines are used to deconvolve the planetary signature .",
    "the 2.04 - 2.06  and 2.36 - 2.38 wavelength ranges are omitted in all the following analyses due to the strong telluric features which dominate these regions of the spectra .",
    "we have generated several models to represent the emergent spectrum of hd 189733b .",
    "our standard  model , an updated version of the model detailed in  3.2 of @xcite , is generated for an atmosphere with solar metallicity , a temperature , and surface gravity , . for a detailed description of the model opacities and setup",

    "the most recent models and their ability to fit  observations made with the spitzer space telescope are discussed at length in @xcite .",
    "a number of further models with adjusted temperature pressure profiles and relative chemical abundances will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "the s / n ratio after deconvolution with the standard model yields timeseries with mean profile s / n ratios of @xmath14 and @xmath15 on june 15 and 22 respectively .",
    "the mean deconvolved wavelength of the spectra depends on the wavelength dependent count rate and the relative strengths of the absorption lines . for the standard model , .",
    "as reported in  4 , the mean wavelength may change slightly when the line list used for deconvolution is modified .",

    "a matched gaussian filter approach is used to search for the planetary signal , where a model describing the radial velocity shift and planet / star contrast phase function is used to search for the deconvolved absorption profile of the planet in the spectral timeseries @xcite .",
    "pairs of maximum contrast ratio ( @xmath16 ) vs velocity amplitude ( @xmath17 ) are used in a two dimensional @xmath18  search to find the combination which yields the best improvement in @xmath18 .",
    "the significance of candidate enhancements in @xmath18  are assessed by a bootstrap procedure which randomises the order of the data within each night of observations @xcite .",
    "this process , carried out several thousand times , scrambles any planetary signature , but enables the data to retain the ability to give false @xmath18  enhancements due to systematics which may remain in the data above the photon noise .",
    "reliable confidence levels can thus be plotted on the 2-parameter @xmath18  landscapes of vs ( @xmath17 ) @xmath18 .",
    "calibration of contrast ratios is achieved by injecting a `` fake '' model planet spectrum into the timeseries and then recovering the signal using our matched filter method .",
    "the fake planetary spectrum is injected with known @xmath16 and @xmath17 after extraction of the spectra and before any of the subsequent steps described above are carried out . in this way , we are also able to assess our ability to correctly recover a planetary signature @xcite .",
    "we find that for a planet recovered with high significance , there may be a slight shift in the recovered @xmath17 velocity .",
    "this is most likely due to some removal of planetary signature when subtracting the template star and during principal components analysis . during these procedures",
    ", we chose parameters which strike a balance between removing residuals while not significantly affecting the planet signal .",
    "essentially , an absorption signature located at phases close to @xmath19 will be attenuated most , since , in this region the planet shows the smallest radial velocity gradient with orbital phase .",
    "the resulting magnitude of the velocity amplitude uncertainty is typically @xmath20  for a planet simulated with greater than 99.9 per cent significance but may be as much as  where a fake planetary signature is injected with per cent significance .",

    "do not possess the ability to recover a planetary signal .",
    "we stress that the argument asserting that the contiguous residual absorption regions are wholly due to systematics and solely responsible for producing candidate signatures is however not strictly true .",
    "any residual absorption features in the timeseries have the ability to modify the contrast ratio and velocity amplitude of a true planetary signal .",
    "since the residual absorption features may be expected to vary in strength it is not unlikely that they would result in a planetary signature modified by differing degrees in tests 1 and 2 . in our third test , removing 33 per cent of the data along the expected radial velocity curve of the planet leaves only regions which are consistent with the mean level , or regions of contiguous `` emission '' relative to the mean level .",
    "one might expect that this procedure would severely impair our ability to detect a planetary absorption signature . in the hypothesis that dark regions",
    "_ are _ artifacts of the data processing ( i.e. imperfect telluric / stellar line removal ) , after their removal we can rule out our ability to detect the planetary signal with 95.4 per cent confidence at a level of @xmath31 . in light of this and our 99.9 per cent upper limit (  4.2 ) on the contrast ratio , we believe that since s09 detect the planet with @xmath32 , further investigations of model dependency on our analysis are required .",
    "we are confident that the planetary signature is not severely attenuated ( there is inevitably some attenuation as described in  4 ) during our analysis procedure since fake planetary signals which are injected before analysis are recovered .",
    "a cause of our inability to detect a planetary signature is likely to stem from a mismatch between the model planetary spectrum and observed planetary spectrum .",
    "the most likely direct causes of line strength mismatch and model line wavelength opacities were first highlighted in @xcite .",
    "line strength mismatches may arise from incorrect treatment of the model atmosphere , including uncertainty in the exact form of the temperature - pressure ( t - p ) profile .",
    "in addition , the precision of the calculated opacities is limited by the accuracy of the einstein a coefficients .",
    "this latter effect may be true for important molecular species such as h@xmath0o @xcite for instance .",
    "we investigate relative line depth , temperature and wavelength uncertainties below .",
    "although the model planetary spectrum may show little variation as a result of t - p profile changes when observed at low resolution , the relative line depths may change significantly .",
    "in addition , the gradient of the t - p profile determines the absolute strength of the absorption lines . to investigate these effects ,",
    "we have generated a series of ad hoc t - p profiles and resulting emergent spectra .",
    "5 shows the models plotted for a short region of wavelength space .",
    "steeper t - p gradients lead to the formation of deeper lines whereas the relative line strengths vary from model to model .",
    "these effects are important since mismatch of the model and observed spectra line depths will lead to a non - optimally deconvolved line profile , and therefore decrease in sensitivity . if all the lines are less deep , they will simply be harder to detect above the noise level .    to investigate the degree to which our ad hoc models affect the sensitivity of our procedure we used our standard model ( black in fig .",
    "5 ) to inject a fake planet into the  timeseries . the fake planet was then recovered and calibrated to match the contrast ratio at which it was injected . by deconvolving with line lists derived from each of the different models shown in fig . 5 , we find that we are able to recover the planetary signature in all cases .",
    "the planetary signature is however recovered with an incorrect contrast ratio and modified relative confidence . fig .",
    "6 shows the relative contrast ratio for a fake  planet injected into the data with 99.9 per cent significance .",
    "model 0 represents the standard model calibration to which the simulations are normalised . the contrast ratio is incorrectly recovered , with model 1 showing a 2.3 per cent overestimation of the contrast level and model 4 indicating a 66 per cent underestimation of the contrast ratio . in all cases",
    "however , the ad hoc models appear to recover the planet with increased significance .",
    "the effect is nevertheless relatively small , with models 2 and 3 showing the greatest increase in confidence .",
    "model 2 indicates an increase in significance of 12.5 per cent relative to the 99 per cent confidence level .",
    "one might naturally expect a decrease in confidence to arise from mismatch of the line strengths during deconvolution rather than the counter - intuitive increase .",
    "we believe that the increase is most likely due to models 1 - 4 yielding strong lines which become even stronger and weak lines which become weaker relative to the standard model .",
    "if one of these models were a closer match to the empirical  spectrum , we note that the relative significance of the standard model would decrease ( with a maximum reduction in sensitivity of 14.8 per cent relative to the 99 per cent confidence level ) . in conclusion ,",
    "the above ad hoc models alone are not able to explain the lack of true planetary signal ( our observations are after all still sensitive enough to detect ) through mismatch of line strengths . relative to the confidence levels in fig .",
    "6 , a true planetary signal could not change its confidence by more than half of the separation of the 99 and 99.9 per cent confidence levels .",
    "+    [ fig : tp_profiles_spectra ]      moderate wavelength uncertainties lead to an effective degradation of deconvolved resolution while model temperature uncertainties may lead to line strength mismatches with the observed spectra during deconvolution .",
    "we were able to use an unpublished improved version of the bt2 @xcite water line list ( with reduced wavelength uncertainties ) to investigate these effects .",
    "most of the strong lines which contribute to the deconvolution are transitions between states whose energies are experimentally known to very high accuracies .",
    "consequently , by selecting only those lines which are greater in strength than 1/10,000 of the strongest line , we eliminate a large number of lines which are expected to have larger uncertainties in calculated positions and which in any case have negligible contribution to the deconvolved profile . where the energies of the upper and lower states of a transition are both known experimentally , these are used for modified bt2 line frequencies , rather than the ab initio calculated values . at 1250 k ,",
    "75 per cent of the water lines in our trimmed list are transitions between experimentally - known levels , and only 25 per cent employ bt2 ab initio frequencies / wavelengths ( in all cases , however , bt2 einstein a values are used in computing line _ strengths _ as these are generally more accurate than experimentally - determined values ) .",
    "@xcite state that a comparison of the bt2 ab initio frequencies with experimentally - known transitions shows that the positions of @xmath33 per cent of the lines tested are accurate to within 0.1 cm@xmath2 and 91 per cent are within 0.3 cm@xmath2 .",
    "at 2.2 , this corresponds to resolutions of r = 45,500 and r = 15,150 respectively . clearly ,",
    "since water is the dominating opacity , these uncertainties will play a role in degrading the resolution of a deconvolved profile for data sets with resolutions of r@xmath3515,000 .",
    "these uncertainties are therefore applied to the 25 per cent of ab initio lines in our 1250 k list by using a gaussian random uncertainty .",
    "this should represent a worst case scenario because we have removed those lines which are weaker than 1/10,000 of the strongest line and which are expected to exhibit the largest frequency / wavelength errors .",
    "we then carry out simulations by injecting a planetary signature into the  spectra using our 1250 k spectrum and deconvolving firstly with the matching line list ( case a ) , and the with an adjusted line list which models the wavelength uncertainties ( case b ) .",
    "the mismatch ( i.e. case b relative to case a ) leads to a planet which is detected with a 6.5 per cent underestimation of contrast ratio and a 14.5 per cent decrease in significance relative to the 99.9 per cent confidence level .",
    "the effect of using a model line list for deconvolution which varies from the observed spectrum in temperature alone is shown in fig .",
    ", a planetary spectrum signature is recovered with 99.9 per cent confidence using a modified bt2 line list .",
    "however both the recovered contrast ratio and significance change when deconvolved with line list temperatures which differ by @xmath36250 k and @xmath36500 k from 1250 k. the effect is again relatively small for an underestimation of temperature ( the increase in significance is likely due to over - weighting of strong lines and under - weighting of weak lines as described in  5.1 ) while slightly more significant for overestimation of temperature . in all instances",
    "a planetary signature is however recovered . for hd 189733b ,",
    "the above effects alone are not sufficient to explain the lack of planetary signature ( using our standard model ) which is predicted at the log@xmath37 = -3.163 level . combined wavelength and temperature mismatches",
    "should lead to a 99.9 per cent planetary signature appearing with 95.4 per cent confidence at worst .",
    "a @xmath38k mismatch in model spectrum temperature results in a 20.5 per cent relative uncertainty in the confidence of a recovered signal .",
    "[ fig : strength_comparison ]     +    [ fig : tempmismatch ]      additional model and observational uncertainties may contribute to an incorrect estimate of the planet / star contrast ratio or its relative significance .",
    "a possible source of error may arise from the planet ephemeris although this has been determined to high precision .",
    "following our previous study of the  system @xcite , we adopt the ephemeris of @xcite , determined from stromgen b and y passband observations ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "a more recent estimate of the ephemeris by @xcite using spitzer 8  observations of planetary transit yields t@xmath40 .",
    "since limb darkening and starspot effects are reduced at longer wavelengths , this has been claimed as the most precise measurement of the ephemeris to date .",
    "the predicted mid - transit time for our observations differs by 73 secs when comparing the two ephemerides , a phase difference of 0.00038 .",
    "the level of precision of ephemeris observations from  is therefore now sufficient that new refinements have no measurable effect on the contrast or velocity amplitude of a planetary signal .",
    "a more important consideration arises from global re - circulation patterns in the atmosphere of . for a tidally",
    "locked planet with a static atmosphere , one might expect the maximum planet / star contrast ratio to occur at orbital phase @xmath13 due to the highest effective irradiation of the planet at the sub stellar point .",
    "@xcite found a difference in day and night side brightness temperatures of 238 k from 8  photometric spitzer light curve variations .",
    "the @xmath41 k dayside temperature was found to be displaced from the substellar point by @xmath42@xmath43 .",
    "this finding is in accordance with 3d circulation models @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite have re - analysed their 8  lightcurves and published 24  lightcurves of .",
    "maximum brightness is found to occur at phase @xmath44 corresponding to a shift eastward of 20@xmath43 - 30@xmath43of the hottest region relative to the substellar point .",
    "we have carried out a simulation to estimate the effect of such a shift which is not accounted for in the preceding analysis .",
    "we created an artificial planetary signal which peaked 30@xmath43  before secondary eclipse and recovered with a phase function which peaked at the same shift _ and also at _ secondary eclipse .",
    "the recovered planetary signature which did not account for the 30@xmath43  shift was found to overestimate the contrast ratio by @xmath45 per cent . the relative change in significance increases by 4.7 per cent since",
    "the contrast ratio must be increased to optimise the @xmath18  fit to the mis - aligned phase function .",
    "we note that this effect will be dependent on observational phase coverage and s / n ratio from night to night ( i.e. shifting the phase function peak to a region of fewer observations or lower s / n ratio will reduce sensitivity ) .",
    "we have assumed an effective  for  of 2.53  which corresponds to a tidally locked planet .",
    "however there may be additional broadening as a result of the re - distribution of heat .",
    "@xcite find that up to 3 - 4  wind speeds are responsible for the advection of heat away from the substellar point .",
    "this shift is somewhat less than our resolution element of 11.99 .",
    "although the wind speeds are effectively translational ( an east - west flow ) at the 100 - 1000 mbar levels from which the 2.2  spectrum is expected to predominantly arise ( see fig . 4 of @xcite ) , we have simulated an additional 4  broadening of the spectral lines .",
    "combined in quadrature with the rotational broadening , we simulate a planetary atmosphere which possesses lines broadened by 4.73  rather than 2.53  from rotational broadening alone as in the preceding sections . as expected",
    "this effect is also minor at a resolution of 25,000 with a 9.6 percent drop in sensitivity .",
    "in addition to model uncertainties , we have carried out a semi - empirical examination of our ability to recover the spectrum of a brown dwarf which closely matches the planetary temperature of 1250 k. k band observations of an l3.5-l4.5 spectrum @xcite were secured by with nirspec at a spectral resolution of 22,000 , covering redder wavelengths in each order than the  observations .",
    "we were thus unable to use the l spectrum as a template which could be injected into our timeseries to mimic the signature of a fake `` planet '' . instead , using the taylor expansion scaling technique described in  2.3 , we scaled the standard  model spectrum to give the closest possible match to our observed l spectrum .",
    "being an l dwarf , our spectrum exhibits significant rotation , with  = 32 kms@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the same broadening was applied to our standard model prior to scaling it to the l spectrum .",
    "deconvolution was then carried out using : ( a ) the standard model line list on the scaled standard model spectrum and , ( b ) the standard model line list on the l spectrum .",
    "closely matched deconvolved profiles are recovered in both instances but with a smaller equivalent width for case b. since  is matched , the resulting profiles essentially differ in their depths only , with the case a profile being 55 per cent deeper than case b profile .",
    "it is difficult to assess wavelength mismatch effects given the broad nature of the profile ; however , we can attribute the 55 per cent decrease in profile strength to line strength mismatches . although there may be differences between a l spectrum and a planetary spectrum , this semi - empirical approach may be taken to represent an upper limit to our line depth sensitivity . the line depth , wavelength and temperature uncertainties in  5.1 , 5.2 & 5.3 yield a 28 per cent reduction in sensitivity when combined in quadrature .",
    "the semi - empirical analysis result may be equated with this combination of effects , and is almost twice the modelling estimate .",
    "we have carried out a high resolution search for the signature of the close orbiting extrasolar giant planet , .",
    "our signal enhancement technique enables us to achieve the sensitivities required to detect the dayside spectrum of the planet that has already been observed at a mean contrast ratio of @xmath32 by s09 in the k band region of our observations .",
    "inclusion of augmented co@xmath0 abundance is however not sufficient to detect the planet with a 99.9 percent confidence level of @xmath46 ( i.e. almost identical to the s09 result ) . a tentative candidate planetary signature _",
    "is _ found at 15 kms@xmath2 greater than the expected velocity amplitude of the planet at @xmath47 . in light of the model uncertainties that have been investigated , finding a planetary signature with modified contrast ratio and velocity amplitude is reasonable .",
    "this prompted us to perform simulations in which planetary signals were injected at contrast ratio levels equivalent to those induced by contiguous absorption residuals .",
    "while these planetary signatures could be recovered , we found that the velocity amplitude may be uncertain by @xmath48 kms@xmath2 , further reflecting the difficulty of reliably extracting a real signal at the 95.4 per cent level .",
    "we note however that a planetary signature with 99.9 per cent confidence should easily be detected , as demonstrated in @xcite .    splitting",
    "the data into two wavelength regions revealed that the 2.21 - 2.36  region ( containing mainly h@xmath0o and co opacities ) yielded a candidate planetary signature with higher confidence .",
    "analysing these subsetted data on a night by night basis however revealed that the signature was not stable in velocity amplitude or contrast ratio suggesting that it could result from a chance alignment of a number of systematic contiguous absorption residual features at the phase dependent velocity position of the planet . by removing these features we found that the signature , close to the known , disappeared .",
    "the remaining 66 per cent of the data did not possess the ability to recover a planetary signature at the level determined by the results of @xcite with between 95.4 and 99 per cent confidence . since the remaining data contained contiguous regions with levels above the mean , this may not be surprising as we only search for absorption signatures .",
    "it is important to emphasise that the tests we have carried out do not rule out the possibility that a true planetary signal is contained within the spectra .",
    "the detected candidate features may be partially influenced by a true planetary signature , but at the 95.4 per cent levels , no confident claim for a detection can be made .",
    "the effects of model opacity strength uncertainties , wavelength uncertainties , temperature mismatch , phase function mismatch and velocity field / broadening uncertainties contribute sensitivity uncertainties of 12.5 , 14.5 , 20.5 , 4.7 and 9.6 per cent respectively . combining these effects in quadrature",
    "yields a total uncertainty in the significance of the result of 30 per cent .",
    "further , if we take the semi - empirical 55 per cent uncertainty as an upper limit to our line depth , wavelength and temperature mismatches , the corresponding uncertainty is 56 per cent . assuming that the l spectrum can provide a close match to that of , the semi - empirical result already shows that the model uncertainties may be significantly underestimated . hence the 99.9 percent confidence with which we reject a signal at the know @xmath17 could in fact",
    "be modified to a level with reduced significance , taking a candidate signal to contrast ratios that are plagued by systematic features .",
    "while the current generation of models can adequately fit broadband photometric and low resolution spectroscopic observations , it is clear that moving to higher resolution requires further model refinement . with the uncertainties investigated above",
    ", we can not rule out the presence of the planet using our technique , especially if further model uncertainties remain unaccounted for",
    ". only further observations which would bring about an increase in sensitivity , or more precise model atmospheres could increase our chances of detecting .",
