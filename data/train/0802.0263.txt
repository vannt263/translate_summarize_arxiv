    "the hot plasma in groups and clusters of galaxies during the hierarchical formation of dark matter halos cools by bremsstrahlung and line emission regulated by @xmath18 .",
    "the action of the cooling is thus more effective in the central regions at higher density , with a twofold effect of decreasing the temperature and rising the density moving inwards . in recent years , the new generation of x - ray telescopes like _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ has been able to spatially resolve the emission from the central regions characterizing the physical properties of the x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "these observations have revealed that the cooling is not the only mechanism that is responsible for the energetic of the central gas .",

    "2006b , santos et al . 2008 ) . in the present work ,",
    "we try to address this issue from a theoretical point of view , just considering how a plasma in hydrostatic equilibrium with a nfw potential with global quantities consistent with present - day observational constraints , changes its physical properties as function of the cosmic time under the action of the radiative cooling only .",
    "this simple model allows to define a framework in which we can make zero - th order predictions on the formation , evolution and fate of a cooling core in x - ray groups and clusters of galaxies , taking into consideration that any deviation from these expectations has to refer to the variety of the heating mechanisms that can affect the energy budget of the structure .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : after the presentation of the numerical model adopted to describe the x - ray emitting plasma in hydrostatic equilibrium in a dark matter potential , we discuss in section  3 the evolution in the observable properties of a cooling core like the cooling radius , @xmath0 , the cooling time , @xmath20 , the gas temperature , density , entropy and surface brightness profiles .",
    "we present the models that reproduce the radial behaviour and the fitting parameters that are more strongly correlated with the age of the structure , being older structures the ones with the lower cooling time at given radius .",
    "a comparison with the observational constraints is also discussed in section  3.3 .",
    "finally , our results and discussion are summarized in section  4 . throughout this work",
    "we adopt the following cosmological parameters : @xmath21 km s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 , @xmath23 , that implies a present age of the universe of 13.8 gyr .",
    "the calculations presented below are based on the time dependent 1d hydrodynamical equations described in brighenti & mathews ( 2002 ) with the heating , conduction and convection terms set to zero .",

    "we briefly discuss how the results depend on the choice of the initial conditions .",
    "we present results for two cluster models .",
    "the `` hot '' , massive cluster has a virial dark matter mass @xmath35 m@xmath24 , while the `` cold '' object has @xmath36 m@xmath24 .",

    "these numbers are typical for giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "the initial gas temperature are @xmath41 kev and @xmath42 kev for the hot cluster and the cold cluster respectively .",

    "the central cooling time , defined as @xmath47 , is @xmath48 gyr ( cold cluster ) and @xmath49 gyr ( hot cluster ) .    in order to better compare the modelled temperature with observations we present results for both the emission weighted temperature @xmath50 and the `` spectroscopic - like '' temperature @xmath51 defined in mazzotta et al .",

    "is then calculated with a similar weighted average : @xmath60 .    in the following",
    "we will normalize the radial distances by @xmath61 or @xmath29 , the radii at which the overdensity is 200 or 500 respectively .",
    "for our two models we have : @xmath62 mpc , @xmath63 mpc ( cold cluster ) and @xmath64 mpc , @xmath65 mpc ( hot cluster ) .",
    "the calculations described here are similar to the unheated flow presented in brighenti & mathews ( 2003 ) , where the reader may find a description of the thermal evolution of the flow .",
    "recently , guo & oh ( 2007 ) have also discussed simulations of the icm in a @xmath66 kev cluster .",
    "the results of our calculations are in qualitative agreement with those in the two aforementioned papers .",
    "as the gas cools in the central region , it slowly flows inward to approximately preserve equilibrium .",
    "a positive temperature gradient develops and the density profile steepens . at the end of the simulations the temperature profile agrees nicely with typical observed cool core clusters ( figure 1 ) , while the computed density is somewhat flatter .",
    "this can be understood with the long initial central cooling time ( see above ) , which makes the `` radiative age '' of our models rather young , even after @xmath67 gyr .",
    "after about one cooling time the gas in the centre cools to very low temperature , this is the onset of the so - called cooling catastrophe .",
    "the mass cooling rate grows with time , reaching an approximate steady - state after few cooling times ( see brighenti & mathews 2003 , 2006 ) . in the calculations presented here the mass cooling rates are still increasing at the end of the simulations , due to the rather long initial cooling times . at @xmath68 gyr",
    "we find @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71/yr for the hot ( cold ) cluster .",
    "a total mass of @xmath72 @xmath71 and @xmath73 is cooled below x - ray temperature in the hot and cold cluster respectively .",
    "this is at odd with observations , which show tight constraints on the cooling rate ( e.g. peterson & fabian 2006 )  a blatant manifestation of the cooling flow problem .",
    "we do not attempt to solve this problem here ( see mcnamara & nulsen 2007 for a recent review on this subject ) . rather , we are interested in the formation of the cool core following the assembly of the cluster or the last major merging .",
    "the way in which the heating necessary to halt radiative cooling influences the density and temperature profiles is not well known .",
    "here we take the position that the average thermal structure of the icm is not greatly affected by the heating process .",
    "this appears justified by the reasonable agreement shown in figure 1 below between observed and simulated , purely radiative temperature profile ( see brighenti & mathews 2006 and guo & oh 2007 for models in which the variables profiles are not significantly modified by jet heating ) . following this assumption we neglect the gravity from the unrealistic accumulation of cold gas in the centre of our models , which would generate a strong temperature peak ( brighenti & mathews 2000 ) .",
    "the radial profiles of the gas temperature , density and surface brightness are obtained at temporal steps of 0.2 gyr starting from the cosmic time of 3 gyr , corresponding to @xmath74 for the assumed cosmology , and reaching @xmath4 after 10.7 gyr .",
    "these profiles are plotted in fig .",

    "the temperature decreases rapidly at first , with relative changes between 5 and 20 per cent per gyr when measured at @xmath5 .",
    "after @xmath77 gyr the temperature profile of the two objects reaches a quasi - steady state .",
    "this results in a ratio @xmath78 equals to @xmath79 after 10 gyr of pure cooling flow evolution .",
    "the gas density rises at a rate of about 15 - 20 per cent per gyr when measured at @xmath5 and of 1 per cent when the increase is evaluated at @xmath75 . after 10 gyr , the ratio between these values is about 35 , a factor @xmath80 larger than the ratio measured at the beginning of the formation of the cooling core .",
    "the surface brightness , roughly proportional to the integral along the line of sight of the squared density , amplifies the variations observed in the density profile and is observed to increase with a mean rate of 16 and 1 per cent per gyr at @xmath81 and @xmath75 , respectively , with a ratio that rises from 10 to 6070 at the present time , both in cool and hot systems .      to characterize the evolution of the cooling core",
    ", we consider the results of the modelization of the radial profiles of the x - ray quantities as function of the cosmic time .",
    "we model the gas temperature , density and surface brightness profiles shown in figure  [ fig : prof ] with analytic formulae commonly used in the literature , which provide a good description of both observed and simulated profiles : @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the radius rescaled for the corresponding scale radius ( e.g. , @xmath85 or @xmath86 or @xmath87 ) . to avoid some degeneracy among the parameters describing the temperature profile , we fix the inner scale radius , @xmath88 , to @xmath89 .",
    "a least squares fit is then performed between @xmath5 and @xmath90 , where the numerical simulations provide more robust results , propagating a relative error comparable to the observational constraints ( without any significant change in the best - fit results , we have adopted errors in the range of few per cent on the surface brightness , 5 - 15 per cent on the gas density , 10 - 20 per cent on the temperature values ) .    in general ,",
    "single power - laws provides a good description of these profiles over partial sections of the radial profile , suggesting that cooling alone is not able to reproduce an emission shaped with an inner , well - defined core .",
    "for instance , while a single @xmath91model well reproduces the outskirts of the gas density and surface brightness profile , a second inner component , either a power - law as in equation .",
    "[ eq : fit ] or an additive @xmath91model , is characterized by very small core radii , of the order of the lower end of the investigated radial range of @xmath5 , and a factor between 5 and 10 lower than the external core radius .",

    "we find that all the parameters that describe the structure of the cluster core are strongly correlated with its age .",
    "when a single power - law is fitted in the inner regions , the slope in the gas temperature profile starts from a value of zero ( due to the initial isothermal assumption ) and reaches @xmath97 at @xmath4 in the cool and hot system , respectively , under the action of the increasing radiative cooling .",
    "once equation  [ eq : fit ] with @xmath98 is fitted , the steepening of the inner gradient is well represented by the parameter @xmath99 , that rises from 0.1 up to 1.2 as the cooling core evolves ( see fig .  [",

    "2006 , dunn & fabian 2008 ) show radial profiles well described by a single power - law with constant slope , like the inner temperature profile ( @xmath16 ) , the cooling time profile ( @xmath125 ) and the entropy profile ( @xmath126 ) outside the cooling region .",
    "all these slopes are well matched in our simple models ( see , e.g. , fig .  [",

    "we estimate `` spectroscopic - like '' temperature @xmath56 and luminosity both including and excluding the core emission within @xmath128 .",
    "the cool and the hot system behave similarly , with a luminosity from the core that rises with time from 25 up to 40 per cent of the total ( within @xmath29 ) x - ray bolometric value , whereas the ratio between the emission weighted temperature in the core and within @xmath29 decreases by about 35 per cent in 10 gyrs . when the temperature and the luminosity are calculated within @xmath29 , including the core region , the clusters evolve along wide trajectories in the @xmath129 plane ( see dots in the right panel of fig .

    "the value of the slope @xmath130 of the @xmath129 relation remains constant around a value of 2.5 , whereas the normalization @xmath131 erg s@xmath132 kev@xmath133 increases from 4.0 to 11.9 after 10 gyrs . on the other hand ,",
    "if , instead of the total cluster emission , we consider only the contribution from the region outside the core ( i.e. @xmath134 ) , the luminosity and temperature estimates do not change significantly with the cosmic time , with a slope @xmath135 and a normalization that rises by 17 per cent only in 10 gyrs from the initial value @xmath136 .",

( 2007 ) . in particular , we associate an age to each of the observed cluster , defined as the age of the models that minimizes the squared differences between the observed and predicted ratios @xmath143 and @xmath144 , weighted by the propagated errors .",
    "admittedly , this estimate for the age is very uncertain .",
    "an upper limit on the age is fixed equal to the age of the universe at the object s redshift minus one gyr , to allow for the formation of the structure .",
    "we remind here that what we mean for `` age '' of the structure is something close , in the observational view of the cluster hierarchical formation , to the time elapsed since the last major merging able to affect the physical properties of the core , or even to destroy it . in other words , our `` age '' can be related to an `` observational age '' by the time during which a cluster evolves `` passively '' .",

    "moreover , the distribution of the age with respect to the median redshift ( @xmath145 ) indicates that the dynamically young structures ( age @xmath146 gyrs ) are preferentially located at higher redshift ( 33 out of 54 objects ) , whereas about 60 per cent of clusters at lower redshift have an age higher than 6 gyrs ( 35 out of 56 clusters ) .",
    "while the predicted ratio between the outer and total temperature ranges between 1 and 1.2 as actually observed , the contribution of the outer region to the total luminosity is expected from the models to be larger than 0.6 at any age , whereas the observed ratios reach values around 0.4 .",
    "this ratio requires that the contribution in luminosity from the core with respect to the outer region should be twice than actually measured in our models ( after 10 gyrs , we estimate @xmath147 , while a value @xmath148 would be required to match the observations ) , suggesting that more favourable conditions for cooling have to be provided ( like different initial conditions ; see next subsection ) to generate objects with similar integrated properties .      the initial conditions described in section 2 are necessarily somewhat arbitrary . for our reference models , described above , we decided to use as initial temperature profiles at large radii the average profile observed by vikhlinin et al .",

    "with this set - up , however , the observed negative temperature gradient for @xmath149 is not reproduced .",
    "it is useful to compare how the results change if the icm is assumed to be initially isothermal at every radius , with temperature calculated from the observed @xmath150 relation by arnaud et al .",

    "the surface brightness is observed to increase with the age of the structure with a mean rate of 20 and 2 per cent per gyr at @xmath81 and @xmath75 , respectively , implying a ratio that rises from 10 to @xmath16460 at the present time in both of the objects .",
    "the cooling time and gas entropy radial profiles are well represented by power - law functions , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 that decrease with time from 13.5 gyrs and 270 kev @xmath13 in the hot system ( 8.5 gyr and 100 kev @xmath13 in the cool one ) and reaches zero after 9.5 ( 6 ) gyrs .",
    "the slopes vary slightly with the age , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tc_r ] ) .",
    "the behaviour of the inner slopes of the gas temperature and density profiles are the most sensitive and unambiguous tracers of an evolving cooling core .",
    "their values after 10 gyrs of radiative losses , @xmath16 and @xmath165 for the hot ( cool ) object , are remarkably in agreement with the observational constraints available for nearby x - ray luminous cooling core clusters ( e.g. donahue et al .",
    "2006 , sanderson et al .",
    "2006 , dunn & fabian 2008 ; see also the case of a1835 in fig .",
    "[ fig : prof ] ) .",
    "this implies that the heating process , if presently active , must not alter the `` pure cooling flow '' profiles in cool core clusters .",
    "the emission - weighted temperature diminishes by about 25 per cent and the bolometric x - ray luminosity rises by @xmath166 per cent in 10 gyrs when all the cluster emission is considered in the computation . on the contrary , when the core region within @xmath7 is excluded , the gas temperature value does not vary and the x - ray luminosity changes by @xmath167 per cent only .",
    "observational constraints on the distribution of the @xmath168 as function of redshift ( maughan et al .",
    "2007 ) show a mean value around 1 suggesting that the observed clusters can not be significantly older than 8 gyrs , once compared with the predictions from our models , independently from the initial conditions on the adopted temperature profile ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lt ] ) . as consequence of that",
    ", the value of the @xmath169 ratio obtained in our model should be about 50 per cent lower to match the lower end of the observed distribution , implying a ratio between the core and the outer luminosities of @xmath170 , instead of the present predictions of about @xmath171 ( see panel on the right in fig .",
    "[ fig : lt ] ) .",
    "more cooling at the core is therefore required to meet the observed trends .",
    "we show that this is can be partially obtained by more flat temperature distribution in the outskirts , once the total gas fraction at the virial radius is fixed .",
    "therefore , a tension between predicted and observed properties rises however when both the temperature profile and the temperature  luminosity relation have to be recovered consistently .    in this prospective , more detailed models following the energy distribution in the cluster outskirts in a cosmological context",
    "are required and matter for a following study .",
