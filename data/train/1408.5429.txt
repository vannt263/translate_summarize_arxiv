    "dust emission is an excellent tracer of mass within star - forming regions .",
    "unfortunately , deriving the mass from measurements of dust continuum emission is not straightforward . in particular , the emissivities of the dust grains themselves are highly uncertain .",
    "generally , dust emissivity is assumed to have a power - law form at millimeter wavelengths of @xmath3 , and uncertainties in the emissivity spectral index , @xmath1 , and the relative dust opacity , @xmath4 , can result in derived masses that are uncertain by factors of a few ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the emissivity spectral index of dust is a difficult quantity to measure .",
    "for instance , the equation relating mass and the observed emission ( see equation [ fluxeq ] below ) relies on the dust being isothermal , which is not a valid assumption in any real star - forming region .",

    "the omc-2/3 region , at a distance of 414pc @xcite , is the richest star - forming filament within 500pc .",
    "accordingly , it has been studied intensively with instruments like scuba @xcite , mambo @xcite , and spitzer @xcite .",
    "these datasets have mapped the extent of the dust emission in omc-2/3 , found dense cores within the filament , and determined which cores harbour protostars @xcite .    in this paper , we present new 3 mm continuum observations of the orion molecular cloud ( omc ) 2/3 region .",
    "we combine our new mustang 3 mm observations with a previously published 1.2 mm map @xcite and a previously published gas temperature map @xcite to derive the emissivity spectral index of dust in the filaments and cores of the omc-2/3 region .",
    "the long wavelengths in this analysis make the derived spectral index much less dependent on the dust temperature than analyses of data at wavelengths around the peak of the dust sed , substantially reducing a major source of uncertainty in most other studies .",
    "here we describe our new 3.3 mm continuum map and the previously published 1.2 mm continuum and nh@xmath0 maps of omc-2/3 .",
    "the 3.3 mm continuum emission from omc-2/3 was mapped with the robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) telescope in green bank , west virginia , using the mustang array @xcite .",
    "data were acquired in three observing sessions from november 2010 to february 2012 and were reduced and calibrated using procedures described as outlined in @xcite .",
    "data were visually inspected and @xmath21 were rejected , mostly due to poor weather . after flagging problematic data",
    ", there were approximately 14 hours of integration time spent on source .",
    "flux calibration was accomplished by periodically measuring the flux density of @xmath22  ori ( betelgeuse ) , which was determined with reference to uranus assuming @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "a key step in the data reduction is the so - called `` common mode '' subtraction , consisting of subtracting an average of all good detectors signals at a given point in time from each detector s signal .",
    "this is necessary to remove signals due to low - level fluctuations in atmospheric emission , but has the side effect of removing astronomical signals larger than approximately the mustang camera s instantaneous field of view .",
    "a key difference between the data reduction procedures of @xcite and those here is that the emission in omc-2/3 is considerably brighter than the galaxy cluster sunyaev - zeldovich effect being studied in the former work .",
    "it is therefore feasible to reduce the amount of flux lost in extended sources arising from common mode subtraction by iterating between the map and timestream model domains , using the map estimated at the previous step to correct the timestream ( common mode ) model , as described in @xcite .",
    "spatial scales up to 2.4 arcminutes are recovered by the reduction and calibration procedures , and the noise in the resultant map is @xmath60.36mjy / beam .",
    "the gbt 3 mm beam can be characterized by a gaussian main beam component ( full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 8.6  and an amplitude of 0.94 ) and a gaussian error beam component ( fwhm = 27.6  and amplitude of 0.06 ) .",
    "the relative contribution of the gbt error beam on the 3 mm map is roughly 20% , with a maximum possible of uncertainty of 30% in some locations . as a result , the 3 mm map overestimates the flux found in an assumed 8.6  beam by about 20% , and we correct for this effect by multiplying our 3 mm maps by a factor of 0.8 .",
    "the resulting map , smoothed to 10.8 , is shown in figure  [ fluxfig ] .",
    "the 1.2 mm continuum emission from omc-2/3 was mapped with the iram 30 m telescope at pico veleta , spain , using the mambo array .",
    "data were acquired between 1999 and 2002 and were reduced using the mopsi package following standard reduction steps .",
    "see @xcite for a more detailed description of the observations and analysis .",
    "the spatial scales recovered in the mambo map are greater than those of the mustang map , a complexity that is discussed in section [ filtering ] .",
    "the noise in the mambo map is @xmath68mjybeam@xmath24 .",
    "the iram 30 m beam has been characterized at 1.3 mm by a gaussian main beam ( fwhm = 10.5  and amplitude 0.975 ) , a gaussian first error beam ( fwhm = 125  and amplitude 0.005 ) and gaussian second and third error beams with larger fwhm and lower amplitudes @xcite .",
    "because the iram 30 m error beams have such small amplitudes relative to the main beam , we do not modify the 1.2 mm intensities as was done for the 3 mm map .",
    "the observed 1.2 mm emission map is also shown in figure [ fluxfig ] .",
    "the 3 mm and 1 mm emission maps look qualitatively very similar , as expected if thermal dust emission on the rayleigh - jeans tail is the dominant emission mechanism .",
    "the nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines were observed towards omc-2/3 by the very large array ( vla ) and the green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",

    "the combined vla and gbt map has a spatial resolution of @xmath65  and a spectral resolution of 0.6 .",

    "the temperature at each position is determined from a smoothed and regridded @xmath25 map from @xcite , putting it on the same @xmath611  resolution grid of the 1.2 mm and 3.3 mm continuum maps .",
    "any position included in the continuum maps but not included in the nh@xmath0 maps was assigned the median temperature value of the map ( 16.5k ) .",
    "the range of temperatures in this analysis ( @xmath26 ) is relatively narrow , so an assumed value of 16.5k will not be too far off the true line - of - sight average temperature for any region in omc-2/3 .",
    "roughly 4% of the pixels in our analysis were assigned the median temperature value of 16.5k . for our analysis",
    ", we assume that the gas and dust temperatues are coupled , a valid assumption for densities greater than 10@xmath27@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the dust temperature map thus derived is shown in figure [ tempbetafig ] .",
    "ground - based bolometer maps all suffer from some degree of spatial filtering as part of the data reduction process , to remove significant atmospheric emission .",
    "the mustang 3 mm map recovers less extended emission than the mambo 1 mm map , with spatial scales greater than @xmath62.4  filtered out .",
    "we therefore pass the mambo data through the the mustang pipeline because the former have sensitivity to emission on larger scales than the latter .",
    "this operation ensures that the same spatial filtering are applied to both the 1 mm and the 3 mm observations .",
    "this technique is similar to that employed by @xcite to compare _ herschel _ and jcmt data . as a result of this filtering , the spectral indices determined in this paper are derived for the smaller - scale material in the omc-2/3 filament and cores and are not indicative of the more diffuse material in the orion molecular cloud . in the relatively dense material traced by the mustang observations , the gas and dust temperatures are expected to be well coupled ( see section [ ammonia ] ) .",
    "we smooth the mustang 3 mm and nh@xmath0 temperature observations to the mambo resolution , then we place all three maps on a common grid .",
    "we consider only those pixels with signal to noise greater than 10 in both the mambo map and the mustang map .",

    "for instance , assuming standard dust to gas ratios and dust properties @xcite , the 1.2 mm emission from a dense core with a @xmath42-band extinction of @xmath43 would have an optical depth of 0.004 , while one would expect an optical depth of 0.1 for 350  emission .",
    "the assumption of optically thin emission at 1 mm and 3 mm is justified for the observations presented here .",
    "the main assumptions required for equation [ fluxeq ] to reflect accurately the emission as a function of frequency are 1 ) a lack of free - free emission , 2 ) a lack of anomalous microwave emission , and 3 ) a weak temperature dependence .",
    "we discuss these different cases in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the emissivity spectral index can be determined from the ratio of the mambo and mustang emission maps . the spectral index at each position in the map is given by : @xmath44 with @xmath32 and @xmath34 as defined in section [ analysis ] .",

    "the omc-2/3 region has a complex background of filamentary structures that are not filtered - out in our data ( see figure [ fluxfig ] ) .",
    "as such , source extraction algorithms that use intensity maxima and minima to identify structures ( e.g. , clumpfind ; see * ? ? ?",

    "this initial catalogue may include unreliable detections , e.g. , due to the filtering .",

    "table [ sourcetable ] gives the positions , sizes , and 3 mm fluxes associated with the 30 robust sources .",
    "the median value of the emissivity spectral index between 1 mm and 3 mm in omc-2/3 is @xmath46 , with a standard deviation of 0.3 .",
    "the typical uncertainty due to noise in the spectral index at any given point in our map of @xmath1 is 0.16 .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in @xmath1 due to absolute flux calibration uncertainties is 0.17 .",
    "the spectral energy distribution in omc-2/3 is much shallower than has been measured in omc-1 , where @xmath15 @xcite . in the following , we discuss possible explanations for the low values of @xmath1 determined in omc-2/3 .",
    "the spectral indices ranged from @xmath47 to @xmath48 ( note that a blackbody would have @xmath49 ) .",
    "this variation is significantly larger than the uncertainties in @xmath1 , so the ratio of the 1 mm flux to 3 mm flux is strongly dependent on position .    we find no significant differences between the mean values of @xmath1 found towards starless cores , protostellar cores , or at positions within the omc-2/3 filament not associated with a core , with core positions taken from @xcite .",
    "the position of possible protostars in omc-2/3 ( asterisks and diamonds in figure [ tempbetafig ] ) , correspond to regions with the full range of steep to shallow seds .",

    "seven dense cores in the orion b9 region have had their spectral indices measured between 350  @xmath8 850 , with a median value of @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "large grains provide a possible explanation for the relatively flat spectral index found in the orion cores in the @xcite sample .",
    "the presence of millimeter - sized grains is also given as the likely explanation for @xmath52 found in three class 0 protostellar cores in the 1.3 mm - 2.7 mm wavelength range by @xcite .",
    "similarly , the low values of @xmath1 in omc-2/3 can be attributed to much larger dust grains than are typically found in the diffuse ism .",
    "the mustang and mambo maps do not recover large - scale features associated with diffuse emission in omc-2/3 , so we have only measured the emissivity spectral index of the more compact ( i.e. , likely the densest ) portions of the filaments as well as the dense starless and protostellar cores . note that @xcite find a typical density for this filament of @xmath610@xmath54@xmath28 , much lower than is found in circumstellar disks but very similar to the densities found by @xcite in cores in orion b9 .",
    "in omc-1 , @xcite find that the spectral index decreases with density , which is qualitatively consistent with the idea that the observations presented here of the densest portions of omc-2/3 are characterized by a low average value of @xmath1 .    adopting the dust grain model presented in @xcite",
    ", we find that a spectral index of @xmath55 indicates that the maximum grain size is at least 1 mm and could be as large is 1 cm depending on the powerlaw slope of the dust grain size distribution .",
    "the dust opacity at 1 mm implied by the range of dust grain distributions and maximum grain size is @xmath56 @xmath40g@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this range of @xmath57 values is roughly a factor of 3 - 7 larger than the standard value given @xcite table 1 column 6 .",
    "core masses can be determined from the mustang 3 mm map using @xmath58 where d is the distance to omc-2/3 . since the mass derived from equation [ masseq ]",
    "varies inversely with the opacity , core masses estimated from their 1 mm flux would be a factor of 3 - 7 lower assuming large grains than assuming standard @xcite grains .",
    "taking the median dust emissivity spectral index of @xmath59 , we find that core masses derived from 3 mm emission are a factor of 2.8 smaller than the masses determined with the commonly assumed value of @xmath60 .",
    "the mass derived from 3 mm emission , combining the effects of a higher opacity and shallower emissivity spectral index , would be a factor of 10 - 20 lower for a model with large grains and @xmath1 = 0.9 than one would derive from an extrapolation of the @xcite value at 1 mm using and emissivity spectral index of 2 .",
    "for example , a typical core in omc-2/3 has an integrated flux of 20mjy ( see table [ sourcetable ] ) at 3 mm .",
    "the mass derived for this typical core , assuming a temperature of 16.5k ( see section [ ammonia ] ) , would be 2.8  for @xmath60 and an opacity at 1 mm taken from @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the mass derived from the opacity at 1 mm given in @xcite extrapolated to 3 mm using @xmath46 would be no greater than 0.3 .      in our determination of @xmath1 ( see section [ betamap ] ) , we assumed that there is no free - free emission contributing significantly to the observed 1 mm or 3 mm maps . in regions of high - mass star formation , however , the 3 mm ( and even 1 mm ) continuum can have a significant contribution from free - free emission .",
    "for instance , towards orion bn / kl in omc-1 ( to the immediate south of omc-2/3 ) , the 3 mm continuum is evenly split between free - free and thermal dust emission and in some places the continuum is actually dominated by free - free emission @xcite . the omc-2/3 region lacks the cluster of ob stars that dominate omc-1 , so we expect the 3 mm emission from omc-2/3 to originate predominantly from dust rather than ionized gas .",
    "the expectation that the 3 mm emission is overwhelmingly from dust is borne out by the similar morphology of the mustang and spatially filtered mambo maps ( see figure [ fluxfig ] ) .",
    "the assumption that the 3 mm continuum emission from omc-2/3 is purely from dust emission has been made in previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and this assumption was also made in the recent mustang survey of six class 0 protostars @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the vla to map the small - scale 3.6 cm emission toward omc-2/3 , finding 14 sources with flux densities ranging from 0.15mjy to 2.84mjy at an angular resolution of 8 . for optically thin free - free emission ( @xmath61 ) ,",
    "the contribution of any such emission to the mustang map would be insignificant , given the @xmath60.4mjybeam@xmath24 noise in the map . for optically thick emission , however , @xmath62 and free - free emission becomes significant .",
    "we expect some localized emission at the positions of the omc-2/3 protostars , which would bias our derived values of the emissivity spectral index to low values at these locations .",
    "the free - free emission measured by @xcite was unresolved in 11 of the 14 detected sources and less than 17  in all cases , so any free - free emission from these sources would be confined to regions one or two resolution elements wide in our maps .",
    "we suggest that the emissivity spectral index in regions with @xmath63 is best explained by contamination from free - free emission toward these objects .",
    "for example , the few pixels in figure [ tempbetafig ] with @xmath63 generally correspond to known protostellar cores or the 3.6 cm continuum sources ( as marked in figure [ fluxfig ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we do not expect free - free emission on the spatial scales of filaments to be significant , and we see low values of @xmath1 associated with such structures as well .",
    "the starless cores , protostellar cores , and the filament all have the same average value of @xmath1 . future observations of wavelengths between 3.3 mm and 3.6 cm would allow us to determine better the free - free contribution to the 3 mm map .",
    "in addition to thermal dust emission and free - free emission , anomalous microwave emission ( ame ) can be another important component of the spectral energy distribution .",
    "a strong candidate for the source of ame is small , spinning dust grains @xcite .",
    "the ame contribution to the total sed of molecular clouds has been estimated in a series of recent papers by the planck collaboration . in the gould belt",
    "molecular clouds , the ame typically peaks at 25.5@xmath640.6ghz , falls below thermal dust emission at frequencies higher than @xmath630 - 40ghz , and is orders of magnitude smaller than thermal dust emission at frequencies greater than 80ghz , where mustang is sensitive @xcite . in the perseus molecular cloud ,",
    "thermal dust emission dominates ame at frequencies greater than 60ghz and the ame contribution at 80ghz and above is statistically insignificant @xcite .",
    "similar results are found in the milky way galactic plane @xcite , and a wide range of galactic clouds @xcite .    to estimate the contribution of ame to the observed 90ghz emission , we use planck data for omc-2/3 acquired from the nasa ipac infrared science archive .",
    "the planck resolution at 30ghz ( @xmath633 ) is large enough to blend emission from omc-1 , which at long wavelengths is dominated by free - free emission , with the emission from omc-2 .",
    "we therefore restrict our analysis to planck data between 30ghz and 353ghz in the omc-3 region .",
    "we find ( see figure [ planckfig ] ) that the emission falls by three orders of magnitude from 30ghz ( 1 cm ) to 70ghz ( 4 mm )",
    ". therefore , emission at 100ghz ( 3 mm ) and higher frequencies should be dominated by thermal emission from large dust grains .",
    "we caution that the angular scales of the planck maps ( @xmath65 10  at frequencies @xmath66 100ghz ) are much larger than the @xmath610  angular scales probed by our mustang and mambo observations . nevertheless , we believe that there is not much contamination from ame in the mustang 3 mm map .",
    "higher angular resolution maps of 10 - 70ghz continuum emission are needed , however , to confirm this expectation .",
    "one final possible source of contamination in the 1 mm and 3 mm bands is molecular line emission .",
    "the main source of molecular line contamination of dust emission is from co , the brightest molecular line in regions like omc-2/3 .",
    "for instance , @xcite found that @xmath67co ( 3 - 2 ) emission contributes @xmath6620% of the 850@xmath68 m flux observed with scuba-2 towards molecular clouds in most regions , but can be the dominant source of emission towards regions with molecular outflows .",
    "@xmath67co ( 1 - 0 ) , at 115ghz , falls outside the range of frequency range ( 81ghz - 99ghz ) to which mustang is sensitive @xcite .",
    "@xmath67co ( 2 - 1 ) , at 230ghz , falls within the mambo bandpass of 210ghz - 290ghz @xcite .",
    "given the temperature and density distributions in omc-2/3 , we would expect an integrated intensity of co ( 2 - 1 ) of @xmath66 30kkms@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this would contribute less than 2mjybeam@xmath24 to our 1 mm mambo map of omc-2/3 , which is much less than the noise in the map .",
    "an especially bright and broad ( in velocity space ) outflow could possibly make a significant contribution to the 1 mm map , artificially steepening the derived value of @xmath1 in its vicinity . over the majority of the omc-2/3 filament",
    ", we do not expect molecular line contamination to significantly affect either the 3 mm or 1 mm continuum measurements of omc-2/3 .      in the rayleigh - jeans approximation ( @xmath69 ) ,",
    "the observed flux at a given frequency is linearly dependent on temperature , so the ratio of fluxes at different frequencies is independent of temperature .",
    "the rayleigh - jeans approximation is only loosely valid for our observations of the omc-2/3 region , with @xmath70 values of 12k and 4k at 250ghz and 90ghz , respectively .",
    "@xcite found that the temperatures of cores within omc-2/3 are roughly 17k , with evidence for warmer ( @xmath625k ) dust in the filament .",
    "the gas kinetic temperature of the omc-2/3 filament was measured using gbt and vla observations of the nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) inversion transitions @xcite .",
    "the gas temperatures are found to be mostly in the range of 10k @xmath66 @xmath25 @xmath66 20k .",
    "we therefore consider the possibility that line - of - sight temperature variations influence the values of @xmath1 determined from the cold dust in omc-2/3 .",
    "when determining the emissivity spectral index map shown in figure [ tempbetafig ] , we assumed that the temperature along each line of sight is constant .",
    "the true temperature distribution along each line of sight is very likely to be variable , so here we estimate the importance of line - of - sight temperature variations on our @xmath1 map .",
    "we construct a toy model where the dust temperature along a line of sight is given by a gaussian distribution with a 1@xmath2 width of 25% of the mean temperature .",
    "we let the mean temperature vary from 5k to 25k in steps of 0.1k . for each distribution",
    ", we calculate the ratio of the continuum emission at 1.1 mm and 3 mm , assuming an emissivity spectral index of 1 .",
    "the 1mm/3 mm flux ratio depends on the temperature distribution of the dust , especially for low temperatures where the rayleigh - jeans approximation is least valid .",
    "we then use equation [ betaeq ] to determine the emissivity spectral index that would be derived from the 1mm/3 mm flux ratio .",
    "we find that temperature variations lead to a small overestimate of the emissivity spectral index , i.e. , temperature variations along the line - of - sight push @xmath1 to larger absolute values .",
    "the error is 2% ( or less ) for temperature distributions centered on 10k or warmer , and increases to 8% at a mean temperature of 5k ( see figure [ correlation ] ) .",
    "we therefore find that line - of - sight temperature variations could systematically bias our derived values of @xmath1 , but at a level much lower than the uncertainties introduced by noise and absolute flux calibration errors .",
    "the systematic bias due to line - of - sight temperature variations moves @xmath1 in the opposite direction of our surprising result - i.e. , we find that the sed is shallower than predicted for dust in a filament while line - of - sight temperature variations work to steepen the sed .",
    "figure [ correlation ] compares @xmath1 and temperature for the entire omc-2/3 region .",
    "we find that @xmath1 and @xmath35 are anti - correlated at the 4@xmath2 level .",
    "an anti - correlation between temperature and the emissivity spectral index has been seen previously in some molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but other studies have not found conclusive evidence for a temperature - dependent emissivity spectral index ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "when using dust emission maps to determine both the temperature and emissivity spectral index , line - of - sight temperature variations can create spurious @xmath35-@xmath1 correlations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though these can be at least partially overcome by careful analysis and statistical modeling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the analysis here is different from most previous studies of correlations between temperature and @xmath1 in that these two quantities are determined from different data sets ( nh@xmath0 observations and millimeter - wavelength dust emission ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ correlation ] , this anti - correlation , if real , is not caused by line - of - sight temperature variations .",
    "it is possible that our assumption of a power - law dust emissivity ( i.e. , @xmath71 ) between 90ghz and 250ghz is not justified . for certain size distributions and compositions , detailed models of the dust opacity between 90ghz and 250ghz",
    "show that it has a more complicated form ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "laboratory measurements and theoretical models of dust grain analogues have found that the emissivity can be temperature - dependent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and not well described by a simple power - law ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the relatively low values of @xmath1 we find might not be a result of large dust grains , but rather may be determined by the grain composition , temperature , and the wavelengths of our observations .",
    "observations of circumstellar disks , however , often sample the sed from sub - millimeter to centimeter wavelengths and these are successfully modeled with a simple power - law opacity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      a trivial explanation for the low values of @xmath1 found in omc-2/3 would calibration errors . given the relatively large frequency range between the mambo and mustang observations",
    ", it would require a large error in the flux calibration to bring the emissivity spectral index into agreement with values found in perseus b1 or the orion nebula cluster .",
    "for instance , if we decrease the fluxes in the 3 mm map by 10% and increase the fluxes in the 1 mm map by 10% , then the median value of @xmath1 increases from 0.9 to 1.0 ( the standard deviation of derived values of @xmath1 remains 0.3 ) . to bring the median value of @xmath1 up to 2",
    ", we would need to increase the ratio of @xmath72 by a factor of 4 .",
    "we do not believe that the flux uncertainties in the mambo or mustang maps are anywhere near that high , so the absolute calibration of the bolometer maps is not likely to be the main driver of the low values of @xmath1 found here .      of the possible explanations for the shallow emissivity spectral index in omc-2/3",
    ", we find that the two most likely are the presence of large grains or a dust emissivity not well described by a single power - law .",
    "if dust grains in omc-2/3 are characterized by millimeter size scales , this would be the first report of such large grains in structures with scales on the order of 1pc .",
    "the protostellar cores and circumstellar disks with millimeter - sized grains have sizes of @xmath73 0.1pc .",
    "it could be important to models of grain growth in disks and cores if the dust in filaments is already quite large . in this case",
    ", it will be important to determine if omc-2/3 is unique in exhibiting large grains or if this is a common feature of star - forming filaments .",
    "although omc-2/3 is unique in that it has a higher density of starless and protostellar cores than other regions within @xmath6500pc of the sun , there are no other properties ( mass , density , temperature , etc . )",
    "that would lead one to suspect that the dust grains in omc-2/3 ought to have properties significantly different than those found in other nearby molecular clouds .",
    "alternatively , the shallow spectral index between 1 mm and 3 mm found in omc-2/3 is due to an sed that is not well - characterized by a power law function at millimeter wavelengths . in this case , the grains are not necessarily larger than is commonly found in nearby molecular clouds",
    ". it would be important to take the true shape of the dust emissivity into account when conducting future studies of @xmath1 in filaments . in either case",
    ", more detailed observations are needed to study the full dust sed in filaments to make accurate measurements of mass , temperature , and possible large grains .",
    "some of the assumptions made in section [ analysis ] and some of the potential sources of error given in section [ discussion ] can be tested with additional observations .",
    "we have made the assumption that all of the 3 mm flux comes from dust emission , but it seems clear that free - free emission may contribute somewhat to the observed 3 mm map , especially near protostars .",
    "the contribution of free - free emission to the 3 mm map can be tested by making observations at wavelengths between the 3.6 cm map produced by @xcite and the 3.3 mm map shown here .",
    "these observations could be used to determine at what wavelength the free - free emission observed by @xcite switches from being optically thick to thin , allowing us to subtract accurately the free - free component from the 3 mm map and make a more accurate map of the emissivity spectral index .",
    "we have made the assumption that the dust opacity is given by a power law , but this assumption can be tested by additional observations . to avoid uncertainties introduced by line - of - sight temperature variations , observations at 850@xmath68 m ( with scuba-2 , for example ) or 2 mm ( with the iram 30 m , for example ) could be used to constrain better the shape of the ( sub)millimeter sed and minimize the effect of uncertainties in absolute flux calibration on the derived value of the emissivity spectral index .",
    "herschel observations between 70  and 500  could also be folded into this analysis , with similar spatial filtering and careful corrections for temperature variations and optical depth .",
    "high - resolution extinction maps could also be used to constrain the dust opacity independently from the dust temperature distribution .",
    "we have mapped the emissivity spectral index of the omc-2/3 using new 3 mm observations paired with previously published observations of the 1 mm continuum and nh@xmath0-derived gas temperature . focusing more on spatial scales of filaments and cores , we find that the emissivity spectral index is much shallower than is often assumed for dust in molecular clouds , with @xmath74 .",
    "we find a weak correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath35 , though there are no significant differences between the average values of @xmath1 found in the omc-2/3 filament , in the starless cores , and in the protostellar cores .",
    "such a low average value of @xmath1 in omc-2/3 could be explained by millimeter - sized dust grains , as inferred in many circumstellar disks .",
    "dust emissivities that vary with temperature or opacities that do not vary with wavelength as a simple power law could also explain our observations .",
    "we do not expect either free - free emission or ame to be significant on the scale of the 2 parsec - long omc-2/3 filament , though , if present and sufficiently bright , either emission mechanism would result in lower absolute values of @xmath1 .",
    "we suggest future observations that can be used to determine the strength of free - free emission and ame .",
