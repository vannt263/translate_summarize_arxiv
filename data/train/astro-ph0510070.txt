    "the confidence limits shown in figure  [ signifzdist ] also indicate that the depression observed in the @xmath27 redshift distribution at @xmath85 is only marginally significant within our sample .",
    "the existence of such a depression could be interpreted as due to the @xmath92 silicate absorption feature entering the @xmath27 filter at this redshift , which has been observed for some galaxies in previous works ( houck et al .",

    ". however , given the errors in the redshift distributions presented here , we can not reach any firm conclusion on the possible selection effect produced by silicate absorption at high redshifts .",
    "we also see a substantial deficit of @xmath27 sources at redshift @xmath93 , with respect to the total @xmath58 sources . at this redshift , a positive selection effect on @xmath27 galaxies would be expected due to the presence of the @xmath94 pah emission line . the observed relative deficit of bright mid - ir selected galaxies indicates that , within our sample , star - forming galaxies are present in a minor proportion at this redshift .",
    "this is quite likely due to a mere cosmic variance effect .",
    "however , we note that this deficit in our @xmath27 sample occurs at the same redshift where there is a dip in the total @xmath58 redshift distribution .",
    "if we consider that galaxy interactions are a triggering mechanism for star - formation , then it will be possible that star - formation activity is particularly inhibited in regions with an under - density of objects .",

    "thus , the major episodes of star - formation activity produced at very high redshifts could be responsible for the construction of stellar mass in at most a minor fraction of the massive @xmath169 galaxies observed at @xmath65 .",
    "also , it is likely that most of the massive galaxies undergoing high star - formation activity at @xmath18 do not have significant amounts of remaining gas to condense into stars by redshift @xmath26 .",
