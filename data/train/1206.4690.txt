    "<S> a qualitative prediction of our consideration is that @xmath72 and @xmath73 in ( [ 1gimp_est ] ) should be of the same order since both terms are related to disorder . </S>",

    "<S> first , fits of @xmath110 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gamma ] also include a contribution from scattering off the thermally excited optical magnons , which is given by @xmath124 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its contribution is roughly equal to that of the @xmath57-term ( [ 1gmm_est1 ] ) at @xmath125k ( @xmath126 ) , but diminishes faster at lower @xmath6 . in the fit of @xmath110 </S>",
    "<S> we use the value of @xmath127 @xmath5ev , about three times the theory estimate : @xmath128 @xmath5ev . </S>",
    "<S> second , the theoretical estimate of the magnon - magnon interaction parameter in @xmath57 law ( [ 1gmm_est1 ] ) is @xmath129 mev , again factor 2.5 smaller than the one used in the fit ( @xmath119 mev ) . altogether , the magnon - magnon contribution to @xmath110 , shown by the dashed line and the corresponding color shading in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gamma ] , is likely a generous overestimate of its actual role in the relaxation .    </S>",
    "<S> still , the contribution of the impurity - assisted mechanism in @xmath110 is very strongly pronounced and is not explicable by the conventional scattering mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> for example , at 12k the impurity scattering accounts for at least 2/3 of the temperature - dependent part of @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter of the impurity - assisted term in ( [ 1gimp_tot ] ) used in the fit is @xmath130ev , which is of the same order with the constant impurity term @xmath72 , meeting our expectations outlined above . </S>",
    "<S> this is , again , the strong argument that both the constant and the @xmath6-dependent terms in the relaxation rate must have the same origin , giving further support to the consistency of our explanation of the data .    </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath73 and @xmath72 can not be determined theoretically as the impurity concentration and strength are , generally , unknown . </S>",
    "<S> however , another consistency check is possible : the ratio of @xmath72 to a characteristic energy scale of the problem , @xmath131 , should give , according to ( [ tau_0 ] ) , an estimate of the cumulative measure of disorder concentration and its strength : @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> this translates into a reasonable estimate of the disorder and its strength in bani@xmath3(po@xmath4)@xmath3 : modulation of magnetic couplings is equivalent to half of a percent of sites having @xmath22 ( @xmath21 ) of order @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of structural distortion in bani@xmath3(po@xmath4)@xmath3 @xcite is consistent with the magnitude of such variations of magnetic couplings , given the strong spin - lattice coupling in this material .    _ </S>",
    "<S> other systems._we propose that similar , and even stronger , effects of disorder in the relaxation rate must be present in the 2d noncollinear afs , in which magnon - magnon interactions acquire the so - called cubic interaction terms @xcite , absent in the collinear afs considered above . </S>",
    "<S> the self - energies associated with such interaction are the same as in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diagrams](b ) and ( c ) , but with two intermediate lines instead of three . with the long - wavelength behavior of the impurity interaction to follow @xmath135 , as in the considered case , a qualitative consideration similar to ( [ 1gimp_est ] ) leads to : @xmath136 where @xmath137 , an even lower power of @xmath6 . </S>",
