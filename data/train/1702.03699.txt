    "the process of photon propagation in a strong external electromagnetic field remains topical , despite an extensive literature on this subject @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the first theory of this process has been developed in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite using polariztion operator method , and the refractive index of polarized vacuum has been found . in external electromagnetic field , vacuum becomes an optically active medium , and the effect similar to light birefringence can be observed . in the works",
    "@xcite-@xcite considerable attention was paid to vacuum polarization and the singularity of the polarization operator in a constant magnetic field .",
    "also , the influence of vacuum polarization on the propagation and absorption of electromagnetic waves near pulsars was considered .",
    "it should be emphasized that in the resonant case the intermediate electron - positron pair still can annihilate to the final photon instead of producing a real electron - positron pair .",
    "however , the divergence of the polarization operator is usually associated only with one - photon pair creation . the cascade process of pair production with subsequent annihilation requires more detailed study .",
    "the similar process of production of an electron - positron pair and successive annihilation has been recently considered also in a plane - wave field in @xcite .",
    "also , there is another resonance in the problem , which is the result of the formation of a bound state between the created electron and positron @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , that the resonant divergences are typical for two vertex qed processes in external electromagnetic field . in this case , the intermediate particle goes to the mass shell @xcite-@xcite .    in this work",
    "the process of electron - positron pair production by a photon with subsequent annihilation to a single photon in a magnetic field is studied using diagram technique .",
    "magnetic field is considered to be comparable with the critical schwinger one , @xmath0  g. such fields are believed to exist at neutron stars @xcite-@xcite .",
    "subcritical magnetic field can be generated in heavy ion collisions with the impact parameter comparable to the compton wavelength of an electron @xcite .",
    "the process rate has been found in the low landau levels ( lll- ) approximation and the polarization degree of the final photon has been considered in resonant and nonresonant cases . in should be noted , that the process rate contains the divergence ( dirac delta - function ) , since there is a single particle in the final state .",
    "nevertheless , it is still possible to consider photon polarization because the delta function cancels in the expression of polarization degree .",
    "let us consider the propagation of an arbitrary polarized photon in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "the landau gauge is chosen of electromagnetic 4-potential , which is @xmath1 .",
    "the feynman diagram of the process is shown in fig.[diagramma ] .",
    "the wavy line is the photon wave function and the internal double lines are the green s functions of the virtual electron and the positron in a magnetic field .",
    "the wave function of a photon has a standard form ( we will use natural units , where @xmath2 , throughout )  @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the normalization volume , @xmath5 is the polarisation 4-vector of the photon : @xmath6 here , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the azimuthal and polar angles , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the parameters that determine a photon polarization .",
    "the green s function of an electron in a magnetic field has the following form @xcite-@xcite @xmath11 @xmath12 + \\nonumber\\\\     + im\\sqrt{2nh}\\gamma^1 \\left[\\tau u_{n-1 } u'_{n}-\\tau^ * u_n u'_{n-1}\\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is magnetic field strength in the units of the quantum critical magnetic field of @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the dirac gamma matrices , @xmath16 is the hermite function , @xmath17 is the argument of @xmath16 and the primed functions in the formula ( [ gh ] ) depend on @xmath18 , @xmath19 according to standard rules of quantum electrodynamics @xcite , the amplitude of the process of photon propagation in vacuum in the presence of a magnetic field can be written as @xmath20,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the primed wave function of the final photon depends on @xmath18 .",
    "taking into account the expressions for the green s functions ( [ g ] ) and the photon wave functions ( [ a ] ) and carrying out corresponding mathematical transformations , it is easy to obtain the following expression for the general amplitude of the process , @xmath21 where @xmath22 have the form :",

    "the following notation is introduced : @xmath33 note that the functions @xmath34 determining the polarization properties of photons coincide with the similar functions in the process of two - photon electron - positron pair production in a magnetic field @xcite .    after carrying out the integration ( [ sfig ] ) over @xmath35 ,",
    "the amplitude of the process has the form @xmath36 note that the amplitude contains @xmath37 .",
    "in other words , in the considered process both energy and momentum conserve , despite the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "it should be emphasized that this is not the case for most qed processes in a magnetic field , and the amplitude normally contains only 3-delta function ( @xmath38 is absent for landau gauge of the potential ) .    in the considered process",
    "the dispersion law is satisfied for the both initial and final photons , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "taking into account the 3-delta functions @xmath41 it is easy to find that @xmath42 .",
    "the case @xmath43 should be rejected as non - physical , since it corresponds to reflection of the photon regardless of the magnetic field strength and the photon frequency .",
    "hereinafter , without loss of generality , we will use a system of reference in which the parallel to the field photon momentum is absent , @xmath44 since the lorentz transformation along @xmath45 does not change the magnetic field .",
    "it is known that the amplitude of this process has the divergence .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to carry out the procedure of regularization or renormalization .",
    "we will use the bogolubov regularization method @xcite .",
    "namely , the denominator in the expression for the green s function should be replaced as follows : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the additional mass . in the bogolubov @xmath9 representation @xcite ( which is similar to the schwinger s proper - time method @xcite ) , the integrations in ( [ sfig ] )",
    "can be performed using the relation @xmath48 after carrying out the procedure of regularization , the general amplitude of the process is given by the formula @xmath49 here , @xmath50 is the positive small quantity .",

    "let us consider the resonant case when virtual particles become real ones . in this case , both first - order poles in ( [ sfig2 ] ) coincide with each other : @xmath57 equation ( [ res ] ) has two solutions , one of which is spurious .",
    "indeed , @xmath58 does not belong to the integration interval ( [ sfig2 ] ) , hence , the singularity in the integrand vanishes .",
    "therefore , we will use the other solution , which has the form @xmath59 thus , the resonant frequency is equal to the sum of the electron and the positron energies with zero longitudinal momenta .",
    "it should be noted that the same condition was obtained in @xcite when analyzing the polarization operator in the presence of a magnetic field .    in the resonant case ( [ wres ] )",
    "the amplitude of the process ( [ sfig2 ] ) takes on the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the width of the resonance .",
    "hereinafter , we will use lll - approximation , @xmath62 these conditions are common in subcritical magnetic field , when the field strength approaches the critical value of @xmath14 . in this approximation in the first order in @xmath13 the resonant photon frequency",

    "the rate of single - photon electron - positron pair production is determined by the imaginary part of the amplitude of the studied process . in the case of unpolarized photon ,",
    "the optical theorem looks like @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the probability of the process of one - photon electron - positron pair creation ( see for example @xcite ) , @xmath69 is the detuning from the threshold of the one - photon pair creation . it should be emphasized that in the formula ( [ op ] ) @xmath69 goes to zero if the pair is created on fixed landau levels with zero longitudinal momenta .",
    "it should be noted that the methods of quantum field theory ( qft ) @xcite-@xcite , in particular the optical theorem , can be applied to the problem of heavy charged particle passing through the magnetized electron gas , which is related to the method of electron cooling . in this method",
    "the emittance of heavy charged particle beam is reduced due to collisions with electrons which have a small velocity spread @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the energy loss of a charged particle in the first born approximation is determined by the imaginary part of the polarization operator .",
    "it should be noted that despite the widespread usage of the electron cooling method in accelerating technology , yet there is no complete theoretical description of the difference in the friction force for positive and negative particles , which is experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "this problem will be important for electron cooling of antiproton beams at the hight energy storage ring ( hesr ) @xcite . the difference in cooling of antiprotons and protons",
    "can be described using qft methods in the second born approximation .",
    "let us find the resonance rate of the process of photon propagation in a strong magnetic field .",
    "according to the well - known qed rules the differential rate is determined as @xmath70 the integration over @xmath71 can be carried out using @xmath72-function properties .",
    "the rate accurate to the first corrections in @xmath13 can be obtained in the form @xmath73+(\\xi_1",
    "\\xi'_1+\\xi_2 \\xi'_2)n_+ h\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 are the stokes parameters of photons @xcite : @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 it follows from ( [ wres ] ) that the rate substantially dependent on the initial photon polarization and vanish in the case of normal linear polarization ( @xmath78 ) within the accuracy of the approximation .",
    "also , the suppression of process rate occurs in the case @xmath79 in other processes in a magnetic field as well ( for example , in the process of electron - positron pair by a single photon @xcite .",
    "the account of the next correction in @xmath13 gives a small but non - zero rate , @xmath80    as it is known , the two vertex processes have the resonant divergences . in this case , the intermediate particle goes to the mass shell and second - order process can be represented by two subsequent first - order processes .",
    "the resonant process of photon propagation in a magnetic field can be represented as a sequence of processes of one - photon pair creation and annihilation of pair in a single photon .",
    "according to @xcite , in the case when the photon has normal linear polarization ( @xmath79 ) , the rate of the process of pair production by a photon is suppressed .",
    "thus , the rate of the process ( fig .",
    "1 ) is also suppressed when the initial photon has normally linear polarized .",
    "it can be concluded from the expressions ( [ wres ] ) and ( [ wxi ] ) that the rate is considerably less in the later case . fig.([whres ] ) shows the dependence of the dimensionless process rate on the magnetic field in the units of the critical strength for various initial photon polarizations .",
    "it should be noted that the width of resonance has the form @xcite",
    "let us consider the process in the nonresonant case when the condition ( [ res ] ) is not fulfilled . in this case",
    ", the initial photon frequency looks like @xmath82 where @xmath83 belongs to the interval @xmath84 .    taking into account the general amplitude and the condition ( [ wnotres ] ) the nonresonant amplitude in lll - approximation ( [ lll ] ) takes on the form @xmath85 where @xmath86 @xmath87    similarly to the previous section , one can find the rate of the nonresonant process : @xmath88 in the same way , when the initial photon has normal linear polarization the nonresonant process rate is @xmath89    the formulas ( [ wnres ] ) , ( [ wnresxi ] ) show that the rate in the case of normal linear polarization of the initial photon is much less then in other cases .    according to the expressions ( [ wres ] ) , ( [ wnres ] )",
    ", the ratio of the resonant and nonresonant rates can be found as @xmath90 it follows from the above expressions that the process rate is substantially greater in the resonant case compared to the nonresonant one .",
    "let us find the polarization of the final photon when the resonance condition ( [ res ] ) is fulfilled . by the definition",
    ", the degree of polarization of the final photon can be written as @xmath91 after developing eq .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) into a power series and keeping terms linear in @xmath13 , the degree of polarization takes on the form @xmath92 equality ( [ p2 ] ) shows that the degree of polarization is almost independent on the polarization of the initial photon .",
    "taking into account the relation ( [ p2 ] ) , the stokes parameters of the final photon can be written as @xmath93 thus , the final photon polarization is almost always linear anomalous and @xmath94 .",
    "the case @xmath95 is the only exception . according to the expression ( [ wxi ] ) , the polarization of the final photon is @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the photon propagates in a magnetic field without changing the polarization when the initial polarization is normal linear one .",
    "it should be noted that the photon polarization shows similar behavior in the nonresonant case .",
    "thus , if the photon is polarized as an eigenmode ( normal and anomalous mode polarizations are @xmath79 and @xmath97 , respectively ) , its polarization does not change after traveling through the magnetic field , in accordance with known results [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "in the present work the process of photon propagation in a subcritical magnetic field has been considered .",
    "the photon polarization is assumed to have arbitrary values .",
    "the obtained expressions of the process rate have been analyzed in the lll - approximation .",
    "considerable attention has been paid to the resonant case ( [ wres ] ) when the virtual electron - positron pair goes to the mass shell .",
    "it should be emphasised that the resonant photon propagation with production and annihilation of electron - positron pair is possible when the condition ( [ wres ] ) is true . in the previous works ,",
    "however , the resonance was associated only to the single - photon production of a real pair .",
    "the expressions for the process rate in the resonant and nonresonant cases substantially depend on the initial photon polarization . in the case of normal linear polarization ( @xmath78 )",
    "the rate has the minimum value .",
    "it was found from the consideration of the polarization degree , that the final photon has anomalous linear polarization ( @xmath98 ) in most cases .",
    "the exception is the case of normal linear polarization @xmath95 , when the photon propagates without changing of the polarization ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "thus , vacuum in a magnetic field does not show optical activity when the photon polarization @xmath100 ."
