    "while the elucidation of equations of state and susceptibilities of pure substances , both theoretically and experimentally , is vigorously pursued due to their immediate relevance in basic and applied research , rarely one finds analysis of fundamental thermodynamic relations which , if known , would allow for the knowledge in turn of all thermodynamic properties @xcite",
    ". indeed , if getting hold of equations of state and susceptibilities , such as isothermal expansions and specific heats , is already difficult , the construction of a fundamental relation appears as an even harder endeavor .",
    "nevertheless , this can be done qualitatively if , on the one hand one knows empirical data in the form of measured phase diagrams and , on the other , one makes use of the power of the laws of thermodynamics .",
    "this is not just an academic exercise .",
    "as we shall see , the fundamental relation indicates features that are absent in usual phase diagrams , such as @xmath5 diagrams with @xmath6 pressure and @xmath7 temperature .",
    "these features allows us to pose restrictions both in theoretical models as well as in measurable quantities .",
    "furthermore , the fundamental relation may also indicate the existence of phases , with their own associated phenomena , that have not been measured or not looked for .",
    "+ the fundamental relation that we address in this article is the entropy @xmath1 as a function of the extensive variables energy @xmath2 , number of particles @xmath3 and volume @xmath4 .",
    "however , since entropy is also extensive , it can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , namely , volume densities of entropy , energy and number of particles .",
    "therefore , the task we perform is the geometric construction of @xmath12 , a single valued surface , function of two variables only , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "as we review below , as dictated by thermodynamics , the function @xmath15 is not only single valued , it is also concave in both variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the difficulty , as we shall see , resides in the correct localization of the different phases .",
    "the reward of this construction , as we have already mentioned , is that the knowledge of @xmath12 completely suffices to determine _ all _ the thermodynamic properties of the substance .",
    "+ in section ii we present generic empirical @xmath16 phase diagrams , based on the measured phase diagrams of ar and @xmath17he @xcite .",
    "the generic substance based on ar will be termed ",
    "normal \" , while the one related to @xmath17he will be called  quantum \" due to the presence of the superfluid phase . an ultimate understanding of both diagrams",
    "certainly requires the use of quantum mechanics but it is the nature of superfluidity that suggested to us the use of those adjectives . the main purpose of section ii is to indicate the main features of the phases as well as the order of the different phase transitions .",
    "we take this as  empirical \" data on which our further analysis will be based .",
    "+ section iii is devoted to a brief review of the laws of thermodynamics and their implications on the geometric and topological characteristics of the surface @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , we shall consider systems whose energy spectra is unbounded from above , since the molecular kinetic energy is always present in the considered systems and , therefore , the temperature will be considered positive always , @xmath18 @xcite . strictly speaking , @xmath19 is banned by the third law .",
    "further , we shall make an strong emphasis that although , in principle , the chemical potential @xmath20 can be expressed with respect to an arbitrary reference , we can fix this reference by imposing that in the limit of arbitrarily low particle densities , @xmath21 , the substance must obey the thermodynamics of a classical ideal gas .",
    "this will give a clear meaning to the sign of the chemical potential .",
    "+ sections iv and v discuss in detail the construction of the surfaces @xmath12 for the normal and the quantum substances respectively .",
    "we will emphasize the crucial fact that , within the convention used , the chemical potential is always negative for normal substances while it can change sign in the quantum one .",
    "this will also be reflected in the geometric characteristics of the entropy level surfaces , being obtuse in the normal case and acute in the quantum version . as an important consequence",
    ", it will be shown that the superfluid phase occurs mostly in the region of positive chemical potential and , as we will further argue , there appears a region in the solid phase with positive chemical potential which may be identified as a supersolid  phase \" @xcite .",
    "we conclude in section vi with a set of final remarks .",
    "a pure substance , composed of a sole chemical compound , can be found in the form of solid , liquid , gas , superfluid or in phase coexistence of the former .",
    "we consider as typical examples of pure substances as h@xmath22o , ar , co@xmath22 , @xmath17he , @xmath23he , among others , of which an abundant experimental data exist .",
    "gravitational , electric and magnetic effects will not be considered in the thermodynamic description of a pure substance here .",
    "+ for the sake of simplicity , we classify the pure substances according to their quantum characteristics into normal and quantum substances .",
    "microscopic descriptions of normal and quantum substances assume intermolecular interaction potentials , typically pairwise .",
    "normal substances can be observed in solid , liquid and gas phases .",
    "additionally , due to particular qualities of the intermolecular potential @xcite , quantum substances can be observed in one more phase , namely , the superfluid phase .",
    "that is , we denote as  quantum \" substances to the aforementioned by the fact that superfluidity is a macroscopic quantum phenomenon , described primarily in the context of many - body quantum theory , see e.g. ref .",
    "there are other systems that can be called quantum substances as well , for example , a fermi gas , a mott insulator , or even a magnet , but here we shall mainly be concerned with the shared thermodynamic characteristics of @xmath17he , @xmath23he , and the recent ultracold alkali vapors , both bosonic , such as @xmath24rb , @xmath25na , @xmath26li @xcite , and fermionic , such as @xmath27li and @xmath28k @xcite .",
    "+ figure [ diagramapvst ] shows generic @xmath16 diagrams of ( a ) a normal substance and ( b ) a quantum one . although stylized for didactical purposes , those diagrams are based on the experimental phase diagrams of ar and @xmath17he @xcite . according to the gibbs phase rule , areas in a phase diagram correspond to a unique phase in equilibrium and lines to the coexistence between two phases .",
    "isolated points in the diagram corresponds either to a triple point or to a critical point . in the figure caption we specify the actual values of all those relevant pressures and temperatures . as we will explicitly do so in sections iv and v , these phase diagrams will allow us to construct the fundamental relationship @xmath12 .",
    "+    it is well known that for a normal substance , with the exception of the critical point that is a continuous second order phase transition , all the coexistence curves represent discontinuous first order phase transitions . for the quantum substance ,",
    "it is also known @xcite that the liquid - solid , liquid - gas and superfluid - solid are first order phase transitions .",
    "the critical point and the @xmath29line liquid - superfluid are second order phase transitions .",
    "although for @xmath17he there are references , such as refs .",
    "@xcite , that suggest that the coexistence curve gas - superfluid is first order , there are no experimental data confirming this is the case . on the other hand , all the recent experimental and theoretical work on the fermionic and bosonic degenerate ultracold gases , that suffer a gas - superfluid transition @xcite , indicate that such a transition is similar to the @xmath30 transition and , therefore , that it is second order .",
    "thus , without affecting our overall conclusions , we shall also consider that such a transition is indeed second order .",
    "besides the assumed fact that thermodynamics describes equilibrium states only , it is very important to emphasize at the outset that a given value of the set of variables @xmath31 of a pure substance uniquely specifies an equilibrium state .",
    "therefore , the entropy function @xmath32 is a single valued function of its variables . in the same fashion ,",
    "any legendre transform of @xmath33 , say @xmath4 by @xmath6 or @xmath3 by @xmath20 , is also a single valued fundamental relation bearing the same information just in the transformed variables @xcite . here , we concentrate on the relation @xmath12 .",
    "+ the first law of thermodynamics is , @xmath34 which indicates that @xmath35 the extensitivity of @xmath8 implies that the pressure is given by , @xmath36    the second law of thermodynamics asserts that the entropy @xmath12 is a concave function of its variables , namely , @xmath37 and @xmath38    these inequalities establish the stability of the thermodynamic states @xcite .",
    "the first condition is equivalent to stating that the specific heat at constant volume @xmath39 is positive , whereas the second one that the isothermal compressibility @xmath40 is also positive , @xmath41 when any of these conditions is not met , the system suffers a phase transition to enforce stability .",
    "+ phase transitions are classified into first and second order . in a first order phase transition",
    "the extensive quantities @xmath15 , @xmath13 , and @xmath42 are discontinuous while the intensive ones @xmath7 , @xmath6 and @xmath20 are always continuous . in a second order phase transition",
    "all the variables are continuous but the remarkable characteristic of these transitions is that , typically , the specific heat and the isothermal compressibility become infinite at the transition .",
    "the main lesson from this behavior is that the function @xmath12 is not analytic at critical points @xcite . for the purposes of our geometric construction we shall use , with no loss of generality , that since @xmath43 at critical points , this implies that @xmath44 at those points .",
    "that is , the isothermal curves , @xmath45 constant , @xmath6 vs @xmath14 become flat at second order phase transitions but remain monotonically increasing at any other thermodynamic state .",
    "+ since we are dealing with systems whose energy spectra are unbounded from above , negative temperatures are ruled out @xcite and , therefore , the third law can simply be expressed as the requirement that the temperature is always positive , @xmath18 .",
    "zero temperature can be considered as a limit only and , as we shall see , this will also be reflected in the form of the surface @xmath12 . due to the identification of temperature by the first of eqs .",
    "( [ tmu ] ) , this implies that the isochores curves , @xmath46 constant , @xmath15 vs @xmath13 are monotonously increasing with their slope becoming infinite at @xmath47 . +",
    "a most important issue is the sign of the chemical potential @xmath20 . on the one hand",
    ", there is no thermodynamic law that bears an implication on such an issue . at most ,",
    "the second law requires the surface @xmath48 to be concave but this does not imply that the isoenergetic curves , @xmath49 constant , @xmath15 vs @xmath14 have to be monotonously increasing , see eqs .",
    "( [ tmu ] ) and ( [ condicion1 ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is commonly believed that the chemical potential can only be defined up to an arbitrary constant since the origin of the energy can also be arbitrarily fixed .",
    "this constant , however , can indeed be fixed for atomic substances by imposing that in the limit of a very dilute system , @xmath21 , the system approaches an ideal gas whose energy can be taken as definite positive since it arises from the atomic kinetic energy only . from a thermodynamic point of view , we can impose that in the normal gas region of the phase diagram , as @xmath21 , the entropy of the gas must approach @xcite @xmath50 which is the classical ideal gas expression for a system of @xmath14 non interacting atoms of mass @xmath51 . in the above expression @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    "are boltzmann and planck constants .",
    "this restriction also fixes the pressure to become @xmath54 and the energy @xmath55 in the limit @xmath21 for fixed temperature . clearly , with this condition , the energy of the gas phase is limited to have positive values only . because of the identification of the chemical potential by the second of eqs .",
    "( [ tmu ] ) , and because @xmath18 , the reference of the chemical potential is also fixed , becoming negative in the mentioned limit @xmath21 . + to look further into the sign of the chemical potential recall that , according to statistical physics , the entropy is given by @xcite , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the number of states of the system for given values of @xmath58 . the thermodynamic limit is assumed to be taken .",
    "thus , for a fixed value of the energy per volume @xmath59 constant , a negative sign of the chemical potential implies that the number of states increases as the particle density @xmath11 also increases , see eq .",
    "( [ tmu ] ) .",
    "conversely , a positive @xmath20 signals that the number of states _ decreases _ when particle density @xmath14 increases .",
    "the first behavior is the common one in classical systems since , even if the energy per particle @xmath60 diminishes , the fact that there are more particles implies a larger number of available states .",
    "of course , as the number of particles increases even further , the increase of entropy will still do so but at a slower rate .",
    "the extreme case of positive chemical potential implies that as the energy per particle decreases the number of available states also decreases .",
    "this implies a kind of  condensation \" that can only be explained within the use of quantum mechanics .",
    "this is the common behavior of ideal bose and fermi gases @xcite , as well of those weakly interacting ones , as given by bcs @xcite and bogoliubov @xcite theories : all of these do show a positive chemical potential .",
    "the reason behind such a behavior is that , as the entropy decreases with even larger densities , there exists a limiting value of @xmath14 for which the entropy becomes zero , @xmath61 .",
    "that is , for the given fixed value of @xmath13 , such an extreme value of @xmath14 corresponds to the quantum ground state of the system .",
    "+ because classical ideal gases , models such as van der waals , and ideal quantum gases present negative chemical potentials before quantum effects set in ( such as bose - einstein condensation and fermi degeneracy @xcite ) , we shall make a working hypothesis that , as it will be shown , it is a correct one , namely , that in the gas phase the chemical potential is always negative . as we will see , this fact will distinctly shape the surfaces @xmath12 for normal and quantum substances .",
    "the logical stages in the construction of the phase diagrams that represent the function @xmath12 of the normal and the quantum substance are the same .",
    "first , we assume the phase diagram @xmath16 as given , as shown in fig .",
    "[ diagramapvst ] .",
    "then , we map the corresponding isotherms onto the @xmath62 diagram . these can also be checked with available experimental data @xcite and with the predictions of van der waals model .",
    "third , we use the behavior of the density of the system in the @xmath62 diagram as a guide to infer the structure of the @xmath63 diagram .",
    "the very last stage consists in mapping the isoenergetic curves in the @xmath63 diagram onto corresponding ones in the @xmath64 diagram .",
    "the last two diagrams , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , can be summarized in a @xmath65 diagram with isentropic curves @xmath66 constant .",
    "+ as described above , we start with the @xmath16 diagram of a normal substance in fig .",
    "[ diagramapvst](a ) . consider an isothermal curve @xmath67 constant .",
    "this is represented by a vertical line that can cross one or two coexistence lines , see fig .",
    "[ diagramanormal](a ) where 5 typical isotherms are plotted .",
    "[ diagramanormal](b ) shows the corresponding diagram @xmath62 .",
    "this diagram is also well known , as can be found in usual thermodynamics textbooks @xcite , but it can also be constructed from the @xmath16 diagram and the restrictions from the laws of thermodynamics .",
    "we highlight several aspects .",
    "first , the isotherms have the same pressure at coexistence .",
    "second , we empirically set the slope of the isotherms at coexistence being higher in the denser state .",
    "and third , the solid phase is assumed to asymptotically reach zero pressure at infinite density @xmath14 , consistently with the presumption that such a solid can occur at zero temperature only and in coexistence with a gas at zero density , namely , an  unatainable \" state .",
    "the most important aspect of this figure , but also a well known result , is the existence of _ unstable _ regions where no equilibrium states occur .",
    "these are the shaded areas in the figures .",
    "+ the unstable states actually do not  exist \" and , therefore , we can not assign a value for any of the variables @xmath15 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , etc , in those regions .",
    "this is very important for the construction of the phase diagram @xmath63 and , ultimately , for the @xmath64 one . that is , from diagram @xmath62 we can construct @xmath63 , fig . [ diagramanormal](c ) , using as guides the coexistence regions .",
    "as can be checked from models , such as van der waals , and from experimental data @xcite , at coexistence the entropy _ per _ volume @xmath9 is higher in the denser coexistence region ; if one considers entropies per mole , the inequalities are inverted .",
    "thus , in the triple point the entropy per volume @xmath15 is lowest in the gas phase and highest in the solid one .",
    "the task here is to trace isoenergetic curves @xmath68 constant in the diagram @xmath63 .",
    "we have two initial restrictions , first , those curves must be concave and , second , they can not cross since @xmath69 is also a fundamental relation @xcite . and",
    "here it comes the fundamental issue that the slope of the isochores equals @xmath70 , with @xmath18 .",
    "the immediate consequence is that the isoenergetics at coexistence , while they correspond to different values of energy , must have the same slope , since @xmath20 and @xmath7 must be continuous . now , since we are assuming that at very low densities the ideal gas is always reached , the chemical potential starts as negative and , therefore , the isoenergetics start concave but with positive slope at @xmath71 .",
    "the question is whether the isoenergetics reach the coexistence lines with positive or negative slope .",
    "again , from van der waals model , one can check that chemical potential is negative in the gas - liquid coexistence states . however , for the gas - solid coexistence states one does not have a reliable model . nevertheless , from the illustration of fig .",
    "[ diagramanormal](c ) , we find that because of the existence of the unstable region and because the saturated gas curve must be much steeper than the saturated solid one , the slope of the isoenergetics at the solid - gas coexistence states , in order to have the same value , must have positive slope , namely negative chemical potential , otherwise they would either point into the unstable region or they would eventually cross .",
    "the extraordinary conclusion is that , for a normal substance the isoenergetic curves are all concave and monotonously increasing functions @xmath15 of @xmath14 .",
    "that is , the chemical potential is always negative for normal substances . as we will see below , the  intrusion \" of the superfluid phase into the unstable gas - solid region makes it necessary the appearance of positive chemical potentials and , thus , the whole structure of the surface @xmath12 for a quantum substance will be completely different than in the normal ones .",
    "+ from the diagram @xmath63 , fig .",
    "[ diagramanormal](c ) , we can now construct the @xmath64 diagram , as shown in fig .",
    "[ diagramanormal](d ) .",
    "here , we have at the outset two strong restrictions , the isochores , @xmath46 constant , @xmath15 vs @xmath13 must not only be concave but because their slope is the inverse of the temperature , see eq.([tmu ] ) , they must be monotonic .",
    "the only delicate point is that , since we assume that for arbitrary temperature one can always lower the density to extreme small values , the energy in this limit must reach @xmath72 .",
    "this implies that the gas phase must end at zero energy , setting thus its origin .",
    "this right away implies that the low entropy solid phase must have negative energy .",
    "however , nothing prevents the solid to have positive energy at higher entropies , or the liquid phase to have negative energies either .",
    "it is therefore not very complicated to conclude that the @xmath64 diagram , with the help of diagram @xmath63 , appears as such . in this diagram , we have plotted several isochores to match the corresponding points values in the @xmath63 diagram .",
    "+     diagram is based on empirical data @xcite .",
    "( b ) we infer the structure of the @xmath62 diagram from the structure of @xmath16 and also from empirical data .",
    "the isotherms are qualitative and must obey the linearity of the ideal gas equation in the dilute regime . note that the critical isotherm is flat at the critical point .",
    "( c ) the @xmath63 diagram is built accordingly to the behaviour of the density and of the coexistence regions in the @xmath62 phase diagram .",
    "( d ) then , we obtain the @xmath64 diagram from the previous step . in both ( c ) and ( d )",
    ", we plot the same isochores @xmath73 constant and isoenergetics @xmath49 constant . ]    the diagrams @xmath63 and @xmath64 define the surface @xmath12 . in order to gain a bit more insight on such a surface",
    ", we can draw isentropic ( @xmath66 constant ) level curves in a @xmath65 diagram . for this",
    ", we first calculate the normal vectors to the surface , placing energy @xmath13 along @xmath74 , @xmath14 along @xmath75 and @xmath15 along @xmath76 , in conventional cartesian coordinates . using dimensionless units ,",
    "say using the gas - liquid critical point as reference , the normal unit vectors of the surface @xmath12 are given by , @xmath77 thus , along the adiabatic curves @xmath78 constant , the normal components in the plane @xmath65 , namely , @xmath79 along @xmath13 and @xmath80 along @xmath14 , always point in the negative directions because @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the isentropic , or adiabatic , curves are all _",
    "obtuse_. this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ diagramanvsenormal ] , where we plot several level curves of @xmath66 constant .",
    "the extreme curve @xmath61 , which is degenerated with @xmath19 , is reached with infinite slope in the gas phase , with zero density , and it is never reached in the solid phase .",
    "this property of the isentropic curve indicates that in any adiabatic process the energy monotonically either increases or decreases , and the temperature always increases or decreases as well , properties that can experimentally be checked .",
    "+     constant in a @xmath65 plane . here",
    "@xmath82 are drawn qualitatively .",
    "note that in an adiabatic compression or expansion the energy is monotonous .",
    "moreover , the tangent asymptotes to the isentropic curves , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , form an angle greater than @xmath85 , namely , the adiabatic curves are all obtuse .",
    "note also that the normal vectors have all negative components . ]",
    "although surfaces plotted in 2d - planes never do justice to the richness of a 3d object , one can gain further information using the normal vector @xmath86 given by eq.([normal ] ) .",
    "the main aspect we want to highlight is that , while the surface @xmath12 is certainly smooth , it can not be covered continuously with the same surface , that is , it is actually formed by patches of surfaces , with  holes \" on it , representing the inexistent unstable states . at any point on the surface",
    "one can set a local tangent plane whose normal is defined by the temperature @xmath7 and the chemical potential @xmath20 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ normal ] ) .",
    "two different coexistent states at a first order phase transition , say , @xmath87 and @xmath88 have parallel tangent planes , which yield equal temperature @xmath7 and chemical potential @xmath20 , and their precise location is further determined by the fact that they also have the same pressure , namely , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "this makes the  sewing \" of the surfaces of the different phases .",
    "the critical point is peculiar since the coexisting planes become closer and closer and finally merge in the same plane at the critical point .",
    "thus , it seems , the surface @xmath12 must be flat at the critical point .",
    "this represents a  suture \" of two different surfaces and the matching can not be made analytically in general .",
    "this flatness of the surfaces at the critical point is an indication of the divergence of the specific heat and of the isothermal compressibility .",

    "this is best seen by considering a curve @xmath15 vs @xmath14 at very low energy in the vicinity of the transition gas to superfluid , see curve @xmath98 in fig .",
    "[ quantumall](c ) .",
    "as we have argued before , in the limit @xmath21 and @xmath97 , the gas must approach an ideal gas .",
    "in such a case , the chemical potential is negative , @xmath99 , namely , @xmath15 vs @xmath14 has a positive slope in the gas phase , see eq .",

    "at such a fixed energy , we know that there must be a number of particles for which the given energy equals their many - body ground state energy .",
    "such a state is superfluid and has zero entropy .",
    "since the curve must be concave , as the number of particles is slightly reduced from the @xmath61 superfluid state , keeping the energy fixed , the entropy must increase and , therefore , the curve @xmath15 vs @xmath14 must have a negative slope in the vicinity of @xmath61 .",
    "that is , its chemical potential must be positive , @xmath100 .",
    "this should not be surprising , bogoliubov theory of atomic bose superfluidity @xcite and bcs theory of atomic fermi superfluidity @xcite both show positive chemical potentials near and at zero temperature .",
    "it is interesting to find that the ideal fermi gas curves @xmath15 vs @xmath14 at @xmath49 constant also all show a maximum and are all similar to the curve @xmath98 in fig .",
    "[ quantumall](c ) @xcite .",
    "the previous argument indicates that there exists a point where the curve @xmath15 vs @xmath14 at @xmath13 constant reaches a maximum , namely , when the chemical potential becomes zero , @xmath101 .",

    "[ quantumall](d ) , can be constructed from the @xmath63 diagram and taking into account that the isochores , @xmath46 constant , @xmath15 vs @xmath13 must be monotonously concave since @xmath18 .",
    "the diagram @xmath64 appears extremely complex because the isoenergetic vertical lines fold over themselves .",
    "that is , there are no states above the line @xmath101 .",
    "this defines the locus of the local maxima of all isoenergetic curves .",
    "nevertheless , with care and patience , one can find the main features shown in the diagram , in particular , one sees that the isochores curves cross each other .",
    "again , this does not represent any problem since the single - valuedness of @xmath12 is always ensured . that is",
    ", the multivaluedness of the function @xmath102 does not violate any law since @xmath13 and @xmath15 are inverse functions of each other at @xmath73 constant .",
    "in other words , the function @xmath102 is not a fundamental relationship .",
    "[ s - e - n - cuantico ] we show a condensed , yet simpler version of the surface @xmath12 .",
    "this figure show isentropic curves @xmath103 constant in a @xmath65 diagram , similarly to the diagram in fig .",
    "[ diagramanvsenormal ] of the normal substance .",
    "the main feature is that the isentropic curves are all acute , with their vertices or turning points at @xmath101 .",
    "this can be seen by analyzing the normal vectors @xmath104 to the surface @xmath12 , using eq .",
    "( [ normal ] ) ( with @xmath13 along @xmath74 , @xmath14 along @xmath75 and @xmath15 along @xmath76 ) .",
    "one consequence is that adiabatic processes in these substances , being non - monotonic in density are also non monotonic in temperature .",
    "a second consequence is that the limiting curves @xmath61 are both reached with infinite slope .",
    "again , the appearance of a superfluid modifies profoundly the whole entropy surface with respect to a normal substance , as a direct comparison between figs .",

    "we draw two types of normal vectors , those with negative components , and those whose components have different sign .",
    "thus , the adiabatic processes showed , expansion or compression , have thermodynamic states with @xmath81 ( @xmath105 ) , and another with @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "the qualitative asymptotes corresponding to @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and @xmath21 and @xmath109 make an angle less than @xmath85 . ]",
    "although there is no a priori reason to consider that the line of states with @xmath101 represents a change in the thermodynamic properties , such as in a phase transition , it does appear to signal a kind of crossover between  normal \" and  quantum \" behaviors , as suggested in section ii .",
    "that is , if @xmath81 , the entropy increases with increasing density , at fixed temperature , a behavior that is in agreement with typical systems obeying classical mechanics : more particles , more entropy .",
    "however , in the extreme case in which systems can be arbitrarily close to @xmath19 , those systems are in quantum degenerate states , and it must be the opposite : increasing the number of particles reduces the number of states since the energy per particle is also reduced until the ground state is reached .",
    "[ mu - n - cuantico ] shows a phase diagram @xmath110 , where few isotherms are also plotted .",
    "the purpose of this diagram is to highlight the presence of states with positive chemical potential .",
    "the crossover line @xmath101 appears to cross the superfluid region and , due to the observation of the previous paragraph , the actual existence of this line could be tested with adiabatic processes within the superfluid phase since it is only in this region where the non - monotonicity of the isentropic curves is present .",
    "that is , the liquid and gas region are all in the @xmath81 region and , therefore , adiabatic processes are monotonic there .",
    "the other important aspect we want to highlight is that the solid region is divided into two regions , one with @xmath81 and the other with @xmath106 .",
    "because quantum properties are clearly more present in the @xmath106 , we want to hypothesize here that the solid region with @xmath106 may be identified with the so - called  supersolid \" phase . as it has been experimentally shown , when superfluid @xmath17he is solidified by increasing the pressure , at very low temperatures , the obtained solid has very peculiar mechanical properties , such as the mass transport through a cell filled with solid helium @xcite .",
    "it has thus been speculated that this is a new phase , called supersolid . with the present study",
    "certainly we can not predict all mechanical properties , however , we can tell that in adiabatic expansions the energy is reduced instead of being increased , contrary to normal substances .",
    "moreover , it must be clear that these solid states must be very different from the usual solid ones with @xmath81 , such as all the solids in a normal substance and the solid states at high temperature in quantum materials .",
    "that is , supersolids , just as superfluids , require a description using many - body quantum mechanics , that explicitly takes into account exchange effects due to the fact that the atoms are indistinguishable .     projection for the quantum case . here @xmath111 .",
    "note that we can distinguish a region in the solid phase with @xmath106 .",
    "this region is in coexistence with the superfluid and we could say that this is the supersolid phase of the quantum substance . ]",
    "thermodynamics methods and empirical evidence have made possible to obtain a qualitative geometric construction of the fundamental relationship @xmath12 for both normal and quantum pure substances .",
    "we recall that , under the assumption that electromagnetic properties are not relevant for those systems , the fundamental relationship bears all their thermodynamic information and content .",
    "+ we highlight that while the main property of the surface @xmath12 is to be concave at each point , the existence of several phases indicates that the whole surface is in fact made of several  patches \" with each phase being covered by a smooth , continuous patch .",
    "first order phase transitions are actually the result of finite regions of unstable states that are actually not existent , with their borders defined by the continuity of the intensive quantities , temperature , pressure and chemical potential .",
    "second order phase transitions occur either isolated , such as the liquid - vapor critical point , or are part of a finite set of states , such as the @xmath29line in the liquid - superfluid transition . in either case , those points are the  suture \" of two smooth surfaces and , therefore , this results on those states being non - analytic points of the surface @xmath12 . + a remarkable result , not easily foreseen , was the role of the sign of the chemical potential , which in turn just reflects the dependence of @xmath112 on @xmath14 at @xmath68 constant , assuming @xmath113 throughout .",
    "that is , negative chemical potential yields a concave _ increasing _ entropy @xmath15 as a function of @xmath14 , while positive chemical potential a _ decreasing _ one .",
    "our analysis indicate that normal substances , that do not show superfluid phases , have the as a signature @xmath81 for all thermodynamic states . for quantum substances",
    "the conclusion is that there are regions of negative chemical potential , such as all gas and liquid phases , while the superfluid and solid ones can have both @xmath99 and @xmath106 .",
    "we have argued that as the quantum properties of the thermodynamic state become more important , the chemical potential becomes positive .",
    "the locus of @xmath101 does not appear as a phase transition but rather as a crossover .",
    "the fact that the solid phase clearly gets divided by the @xmath101 line ( a local maximum of @xmath15 vs @xmath14 at @xmath49constant ) has prompted us to identify such a solid region as the recently discussed  supersolid \" phase .",
    "these regions certainly occur as the temperature is arbitrarily lowered .",
    "+ we also remark again that the existence of superfluid phases , with its concomitant change of the sign of the chemical potential , globally affects the whole surface @xmath12 , making it obtuse for normal substances and acute for quantum ones .",
    "this has as a consequence that adiabatic processes in normal substances are always monotonic , while non - monotonic in the quantum ones .",
    "it is further interesting that the non - monotonicity can not be experimentally tested in the gas and fluid phases but in the superfluid and solid phases only ."
