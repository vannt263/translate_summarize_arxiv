    "the parameter space of shock formation in adiabatic transonic accretion discs was first discussed in chakrabarti(1989 ) .",
    "though time - dependent numerical simulation of transonic accretion disc in the presence of cooling was dealt in molteni , sponholz & chakrabarti ( 1996 , hereafter msc96 ) , the detailed study of parameter space was reserved for the future . in this paper",
    "we describe the procedure for obtaining the flow topology in the presence of bremsstrahlung cooling and obtain the dependence of topology and shock formation on the parameters , accretion rate and specific angular momentum .",
    "the equations which govern the flow are the basic conservation equations of mass , momentum and energy .",
    "the pseudo newtonian potential of paczynski - wiita ( 1980 ) is used , which mimics the gravitational field around a schwarzschild black hole to a sufficient accuracy .",
    "the effect of bremsstrahlung cooling ( lang 1980 ) in electron - proton plasma is included in the energy equation . @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the velocity , density and pressure respectively .    continuity equation :    @xmath2    euler equation :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the paczynski - wiita potential , @xmath5 is the gravitational constant , m is the mass of the black hole , @xmath6 is the schwarzschild radius and @xmath7 is the velocity of light",
    ".    energy equation :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the specific energy , @xmath10 is the thermal energy , @xmath11 is the adiabatic index , @xmath12 is the expression for bremsstrahlung cooling , @xmath13 is the temperature , @xmath14 is the mass of proton , @xmath15 is the gaunt factor and @xmath16 is the heating term .",
    "thin disc approximation :    we use cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath17 for the axisymmetric flow . because of axisymmetry and thinness of the disc the following assumptions are made .",
    "@xmath18  i.e. @xmath19 is not a function of @xmath20 and @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath25  i.e. @xmath1 is a function of r only    @xmath26    @xmath27    by the help of these assumptions it is possible to write the steady state equations in the following form .",
    "@xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    where @xmath31 denotes the derivative with respect to r , @xmath32 in cgs units and the polytropic relation @xmath33 is used to obtain the sound speed @xmath34 .",
    "these equations are solved using fourth - order runge - kutta method ( press et al .",
    "the flow can pass through a point where denominator in the expression for @xmath35 becomes zero .",
    "if it happens that the numerator also becomes zero , then @xmath35 can be finite .",
    "we call such a point a critical point . in this problem",
    "the critical point is same as sonic point . at critical point , using l hospital s rule , we get ( for @xmath36 ) ,    @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40    @xmath41    where @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the boltzmann constant . now starting from the critical point we obtain the transonic solution topologies .",
    "fluid dynamical problems are inherently sensitive to the boundary conditions . we formulate the problem as follows .",
    "the variables which are functions of space and time are @xmath45   or  @xmath46 .",
    "the parameters are accretion rate , specific angular momentum(@xmath47 ) , @xmath11 , cooling process and viscosity .",
    "we consider inviscous flow , set @xmath48 and the mass of the black hole @xmath49 is chosen as @xmath50 .",
    "so the free parameters are accretion rate and @xmath47 .",
    "the location of the critical points , @xmath51 , is the freedom we have , subjected to the constraint that shock conditions should be satisfied .",
    "the natural constraint of stability is likely to decide the uniqueness of the solution .",
    "the algorithm for obtaining the numerical solution is ,    \\1 .",
    "choose accretion rate and @xmath47    \\2 .",
    "choose @xmath52 and @xmath53 range and find corresponding @xmath54 and @xmath55    \\3 .",
    "obtain solution topology by using fourth - order runge - kutta method    \\4 .",
    "check the shock conditions    the typical components of the topology are shown in fig.1 , where mach number is plotted as a function of the radial distance . fig.2 and 3 shows the solution topologies for chosen parameter values .",
    "rankine - hugoniot shock conditions ( landau & lifshitz 1984 ) basically ensure that mass , momentum and energy are conserved in spite of a discontinuity .",
    "for infinitesimally thin and non - dissipative shock , the shock conditions take the form ,    @xmath56    where the suffixes 1 and 2 refer to pre - shock and post - shock quantities .",
    "we use the following procedure to obtain the parameter space . the accretion rate in eddington units ,",
    "is varied in the range ( .0001 , 500 ) and @xmath47 in the units of @xmath57 , is varied in the range @xmath58 .",
    "it is suggested that ( chakrabarti 1996 ) flows with @xmath47 in the range between that of marginally stable and marginally bound orbit would form steady accretion discs , when self - gravity of the disc is neglected . for a chosen accretion rate and @xmath47",
    "we scan the r - axis from 1.5@xmath59 to 1000@xmath59 to find if it can be a critical point .",
    "the critical point can be of x or alp or pla or la or x type as shown in fig.1 .",
    "x looks like the english alphabet x , alp like greek alphabet alpha which opens towards infinity , pla is reflected alp which opens towards inner boundary , la is pla which does nt reach the inner boundary when @xmath47 is high and x is x which does nt reach the inner boundary when accretion rate is high . for certain parameter values",
    "there is an intermediate range of r which can not be a critical point ( denoted by - in topology column of table 1 ) .",
    "table 1 shows the parameter space .",
    "we obtain supersonic branches for outer critical points and subsonic branches for inner critical points .",
    "when shock conditions are satisfied the flow makes a transition from supersonic to subsonic branch and reaches the inner boundary ( chosen as 1.5@xmath59 ) supersonically . when shock conditions are not satisfied accretion is still possible if x type critical point exists .",
    "of all the different possible branches of accretion for chosen parameter value , the real flow is likely to choose the branch which is most stable , as perturbations are always present in a real situation .",
    "if the assumption of steady flow is relaxed the flow might still choose a steady solution branch if the time scale of change is large .",
    "time - dependent numerical simulation of the flow ( msc96 ) shows that flow solution oscillates about the steady state solution when certain resonance condition is met .",
    "the perturbations which occur in a numerical code and physical perturbations should be related , to increase the faith in numerical results .",
    "such numerical studies will be pursued in the future .",
    "the oscillation of shock location ( msc96 ) would mean the size of post - shock region , which is the source for hard photons ( chakrabarti & titarchuk 1995 ) , is also oscillating .",
    "these would result in quasi periodic oscillations as reported in chakrabarti & manickam ( 2000 ) .",
