    "it is believed that rotation - powered pulsars possess a magnetosphere in which charged particles are accelerated to relativistic lorentz factors and generate a broad spectrum of pulsed emission ( from radio , to ir , optical , x - ray and @xmath2-ray ) .",
    "the detailed physics of the global magnetosphere depends on various factors such as the efficiency of primary - particle ( electron ) ejection and acceleration near the neutron star ( ns ) surface , conditions for the occurrence and intensity of electron - positron pair creation , the spatial distribution of electromagnetic fields and currents , and particle energy loss mechanisms .",
    "although the vacuum magnetosphere model of deutsch ( 1955 ) is , at present , the only available non - axisymmetric closed analytic model for the electromagnetic field of a rotating magnetic dipole , it is not an appropriate physical model of an active pulsar magnetosphere filled with charges and currents .",
    "historically , the development of more realistic models began with the idealized equation governing the structure of an axisymmetric pulsar magnetosphere ( see e.g. mestel 1973 ; scharlemann & wagoner 1973 ; michel 1973 ; okamoto 1974 ; mestel et al .",
    "1979 and references therein ) .",
    "this equation , sometimes referred to as the pulsar equation , is the astrophysical counterpart of the force - free grad - shafranov equation ( see the original publications by grad [ 1967 ] & shafranov [ 1966 ] ) .",

    "although the force - free magnetosphere is probably a closer approximation to a real pulsar than the vacuum solution , it is still not a truly self - consistent model since the production of pair plasma requires particle acceleration and thus a break down of force - free conditions in some regions of the magnetosphere .",
    "furthermore , it will apply to the younger pulsars that can readily supply the requisite charge through copious electron - positron pair cascades .",

    "however , more recent 3d plasma simulations ( spitkovsky & arons 2002 ; biltzinger & thielheim 2004 ; and spitkovsky 2004 , 2006 , 2008 ) found that the charge domes are subject to diocotron instability , allowing charge from disrupted domes to fill the vacuum regions , opening up the possibility for a charge - filled magnetosphere .",
    "studies of polar cap acceleration and pair cascades ( harding & muslimov 2001 , 2002 , harding , muslimov & zhang 2002 ) have found that only the youngest third of the known pulsar population ( those that can produce pairs through curvature radiation ) is capable of producing enough charges in pair cascades to completely screen the parallel electric field",

    "we explore a fully analytic steady - state solution illustrating that the initially dipolar magnetic field undergoes growing topological change at increasingly higher altitudes by the self - consistent electric current that generates the 3d - monopole - type magnetic configuration ( the corresponding magnetic field strength , @xmath6 , scales as @xmath7 ) . in our solution both",
    "the electric current and magnetic field are determined self - consistently , and it is assumed that near the polar cap surface the current matches the self - limited current calculated for the magnetic field determined by a pure dipole with small corrections from the 3d monopole .    the paper is organized as follows . in ",

    "3 we present our analytic solution for the magnetic field and currents . in   4 we discuss the results of our study and summarize our main conclusions .",
    "the very general equations describing the electromagnetic field of a rotating ns in the lab ( inertial ) frame are the first couple , = 0 , [ divb ] = - 1c , [ curle ] and the second couple of maxwell s equations , = 4 , [ dive ] = 1c + 4 c * j * , [ curlb ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the electric charge and current densities , respectively ; and all physical quantities , such as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath9 , and @xmath8 are defined in the lab frame .",
    "we will be searching for the steady - state solution to equations ( [ divb])-([curlb ] ) in the domain of open - magnetic - field lines . in the steady state that is assumed to exist ,",
    "the time derivatives in equations ( [ curle ] ) and ( [ curlb ] ) are determined by the proper set of special - relativistic transformations of the electromagnetic quantities in the case of rotational motion of open - field lines relative to the lab frame .",
    "moreover , it is important that in our model , even within the light cylinder , the open - magnetic - field lines may rotate slightly differentially without being wound up ( see  3 below ) . to get the system of steady - state maxwell s equations",
    ", we can use the following special - relativistic transformations ( see mh05 ) of partial time derivatives between the lab frame ( subscript  lab \" ) and the frame of reference corotating with the open - field lines ( subscript  corot \" ) : \\ { } _ corot = \\ { } _ lab - * * ( * u*_rot ) , [ db / dt ] \\ { } _ corot = \\ { } _ lab - * * ( * u*_rot ) + * u*_rot  * e * , [ de / dt ] \\ { } _ corot = \\ { } _ lab + * u*_rot , [ drho / dt ] where @xmath12 (= @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the angular velocity that can , generally , be differential ) is the linear rotational velocity of the open - field lines .",
    "we assume that in a steady state , the time derivatives in the lhs of equations ( [ db / dt])-([drho / dt ] ) vanish ( i.e. the electromagnetic fields  seen \" by the observer corotating with the magnetic flux tube are stationary ) , so that maxwell equations ( [ curle ] ) and ( [ curlb ] ) can be rewritten in the following form = - ( _ rot ) , [ curle-2 ] = ( _ rot ) - _ rot + 4c*j*. [ curlb-2 ] where @xmath15 .",
    "as in our previous study ( see mh05 ) , we shall use the magnetic spherical polar coordinates ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ; where @xmath28 ) with the polar axis along the magnetic moment of a ns .",
    "the magnetic coordinates are appropriate for modeling the magnetic field structure in the vicinity of the ns ( at @xmath29 ) with any obliquity .",
    "however , the magnetic coordinates are inconvenient in describing the effects of rotation on the global magnetosphere , simply because the rotation can break the symmetry with respect to the magnetic axis at @xmath30 and for arbitrary obliquity .",
    "intuitively , one may expect that , at higher altitudes , the magnetic coordinates get transformed into the spherical coordinates with the @xmath31 axis along the ns rotation axis that determines the global symmetry .",
    "indeed , we can observe that ( see e.g. formulae [ 73]-[75 ] in mh05 ) , in magnetic coordinates , the effects of rotation ( besides making the corresponding terms proportional to @xmath14 and having certain radial dependence ) enter formulae for the magnetic field structure in an elegant way , through a single function , @xmath32 of the angle between the ns rotation axis and radius - vector of a given point ( in terms of magnetic polar coordinates ) , s = + , [ s ] and its derivatives over @xmath26 and @xmath27 . here , according to our notation , @xmath33 is the ns obliquity angle .",
    "note that @xmath34 determines the symmetry axis in magnetic coordinates which is the ns rotation axis .",
    "in addition , the function @xmath35 is a  toroidal potential \" for the rotational linear velocity , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the unit vector in radial direction .",
    "we therefore choose to express our solution for @xmath20 , which is in magnetic spherical polar coordinates , in terms of @xmath35 .    in our calculation the following couple of useful formulae",

    "= 1-s^2 , [ sder1 ] and ( ) + 1 ^2 s = -2s .",
    "[ sder2 ] these formulae illustrate that the function @xmath35 is perfectly suitable for describing the effects of rotation ( rotation - induced symmetry ) in magnetic coordinates .    for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we shall ignore all general - relativistic corrections ( including the important effect of _ frame dragging _ ) throughout this paper .",
    "since we are not going to discuss the polar cap electrodynamics , all these corrections may only unnecessarily complicate the resulting formulae .",
    "we assume , that the magnetic field in the innermost magnetosphere ( well within the lc ) can be presented as = * b*^(d ) +  * b*^(1 ) , [ b1 - 1 ] where ^d = b_0^d  ( _ r + 12 _ ) [ bd ] is a pure dipole magnetic field anchored into the ns and ^(1 ) = * b*^(1 ) ( , s , , ) [ b1 - 2 ] is the magnetic field generated by the self - consistent electric currents in the domain of the magnetosphere with open field lines .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 determines the strength of the @xmath39-component relative to the dipole one and also constrains the limiting value of the density of primary ( electron ) current at the polar cap surface ( see condition [ [ eps-2 ] ] below ) .",
    "the @xmath39-component and the corresponding density of the self - consistent electric current are determined by the maxwell s equations ( that , within the notations , coincide with equations [ 24]-[26 ] of mh05 )  ^(1 ) = 4  c  * j*^(1 ) , [ curlb1 ] ^(1 ) = 0 , [ divb1 ] ^(1 ) = 0 .",
    "[ divj1 ] equations ( [ curlb1])-([divj1 ] ) are the standard magnetostatic equations . before we proceed with the analytic solution to these equations",
    ", we should specify the fundamental requirements to the expected solution .",
    "first , we will be solving equations ( [ curlb1])-([divj1 ] ) in magnetic spherical polar coordinates @xmath40 .",
    "second , in our previous study ( mh05 ) we have demonstrated that the generic current of primary electrons relativistically flowing along the dipole magnetic field of a ns is capable of generating the perturbation to the dipole magnetic field that has a @xmath7-radial dependence . the fact that this current of primary electrons generates the @xmath7 correction to the magnetic field and matches the self - consistent current we derive in this paper at low altitudes ( and in a small - angle approximation ) is very suggestive .",
    "also , the leading term in the charge density ( all the way from the polar cap surface to the lc ) scales as @xmath41 which means that from basic dimensionality analysis @xmath42 should scale as @xmath43 .",
    "so , we will be searching for the solution to equations ( [ curlb1])-([divj1 ] ) having the same radial dependence .",
    "third , both the magnetic field and density of electric current are expected to depend on angular variables through the function @xmath35 and its derivatives over @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this is important because in magnetic coordinates it is the function @xmath35 that can be used in an elegant way to describe the effect of rotation and symmetry with respect to the rotation axis , and hence to ensure that the corresponding solution to maxwell s equations ( [ curlb1 ] ) - ( [ divj1 ] ) will posses rotational symmetry .",
    "finally , the @xmath14-dependence will enter the solution ( see also mh05 ) through the dimensionless radial coordinate , @xmath44 .",
    "physically , this means that we choose to express the solution for @xmath20 as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is some vector function ( to be solved ) that depends only on the function @xmath35 and its derivatives over @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "likewise , the current density in equation ( [ curlb1 ] ) becomes automatically proportional to the @xmath47 , which is just the amplitude of the current density of primary electrons .",
    "this general reasoning is sufficient to construct the exact solution for @xmath20 and @xmath48 ( note that @xmath48 is just one of the three terms contributing to @xmath49 , as discussed right after equation [ [ jtot ] ] ) having the well - specified bulk properties .",
    "thus , what remains to be determined is the exact form of angular dependence for our solution .",
    "the general solution for @xmath39 satisfying solenoidality condition ( [ divb1 ] ) and scaling as @xmath50 ( and therefore can be dubbed as the 3d - monopole - type solution ) reads b_r^(1 ) = b_0^d f^p(s ) , [ b1r ] b_^(1 ) = b_0^d 1  ( g^p(s )  s + h^t(s )  1 s ) , [ b1theta ] b_^(1 ) = b_0^d 1  ( g^p(s )  1  s - h^t(s )  s ) , [ b1phi ] where g^p(s ) = 1 [ g^p ] is uniquely determined by the solenoidality of @xmath39 .",
    "although this is a rigorous result , the singularity on the symmetry axis ( @xmath34 ) should be excluded from the solution domain for the simple physical reason that the symmetry axis is a current - free area ( see also discussion following equation [ [ j1phi-2 ] ] below ) . in equations ( [ b1r])-([b1phi ] )",
    "@xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",

    "[ alpha^t ] thus , the components of the magnetic field ( [ b1 - 1 ] ) and electric current density ( [ j1r])-([j1phi ] ) can be presented as b_r = b_0^d  ( +  x  s ) , [ br ] b _",

    "the physical meaning of this singularity can be better understood by evaluating the gj charge density ( see formula [ [ gj1 ] ] and discussion following formula [ [ gj2 ] ] below ) at the polar cap surface : the surface value of the gj charge density decreases very near the rotation axis .",
    "this means that the maximum charge density of electrons that can be ejected from the polar cap surface should also decrease toward the rotation axis .",
    "it is important that , on the magnetic field lines surrounding the rotation axis , the electrostatic potential is constant , and therefore the accelerating electric field should vanish on these field lines .",
    "thus , according to our solution , the polar cap region near the rotation axis is a current - free region that is also unfavorable for particle acceleration .",
    "apparently , our analytic approach is not applicable to this region , and the field lines whose footpoints have @xmath60 should be excluded from consideration . we should also point out that , although our solution still implies some enhancement of the magnetic energy density towards the rotation axis ( collimation of the field lines towards the rotation axis ) , the magnetic flux through the surface normal to the open field lines is constant and is by no means singular even at @xmath61 .",

    "[ f - line ] on each magnetic surface , the angular velocity , @xmath14 , should satisfy the following condition ( also known as the ferraro s isorotation law ) , ^p= 0 , [ bnablaomega ] meaning that @xmath14 is a function of @xmath65 only ( in other words , the angular velocity is constant along each poloidal field line ) , thus ensuring that there is no winding - up of the magnetic field lines .",

    "we assume that , in the domain where the dipole field dominates , the angular velocity of open field lines is constant , @xmath69 ( solid - body rotation ) , but as @xmath20 begins to dominate @xmath70 const is no longer required .    to illustrate the effect of differential rotation of open field lines ( in the domain where @xmath20 prevails ) , we may approximate @xmath71 by the simple formula = _ 0 , [ omega1 ] where @xmath72 is the angular velocity of the ns , and @xmath73 is a parameter ( @xmath74 ) to be determined by matching the solution for @xmath14 beyond the lc with that within the lc .",

    "because our solution implicitly incorporates differential rotation of surfaces of constant magnetic flux , we should be able to smoothly match the differential angular velocity beyond the lc with the nearly constant angular velocity well inside the lc ( see e.g. the corresponding limits of formula [ [ omega1 ] ] ) .",

    "we depict the field line geometry in the meridional plane ( cutting through the rotation and magnetic axes ) for different values of obliquity angle , @xmath109 , @xmath106 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 and for the value of @xmath112 . to plot the field lines we used formulae ( [ br])-([bphi ] ) for the fixed values of magnetic azimuth , @xmath113 and @xmath114 . in figures 2 - 5",
    "we used the cartesian @xmath115 plane where the positive @xmath116-axis is along the magnetic axis , and the rotation axis ( in the oblique cases ) is pointing to the upper - right corner ( in the orthogonal case the rotation axis is along the positive @xmath117-axis ) .",
    "the coordinates are scaled by the lc radius , @xmath118 .",
    "the magnetic colatitudes of the footpoints of all field lines range from @xmath119 through @xmath120 of the half - angular size of the canonical polar cap with the step of @xmath119 ( except the orthogonal case for which @xmath121 ) . from figures 2 - 5",
    "one can clearly see the effect of collimation of field lines along the rotation axis .",
    "the magnitude of the collimation depends on the parameter @xmath96 and @xmath83 ( value of @xmath35 for the field line footpoint ) : favorably - curved field lines tend to collimate much more than unfavorably - curved ones . for the aligned rotator ( see figure 2 ) the effect of collimation may be significant for most field lines emanating from the polar cap . also , in the aligned case , the field lines experience substantial sweepback ( see figure 1a , b ) .",
    "it is important to note that , although our approximation is valid only within the canonical lc ( up to @xmath122 of the lc radius ) , in figures 2 - 6 we presented the magnetic field lines up to the cylindrical radius slightly greater than the lc radius ( although some field lines close outside the lc , this is unlikely to happen in the global model , because here we have not included the @xmath23 drift and rotation effect ) . in this way , we believe",
    ", the behavior of our solution could be better understood , and its deficiencies are more clearly exposed .",
    "figures 2 - 5 show that for small values of @xmath35 the topology of magnetic field lines in the meridional plane ( @xmath115 plane ) is very close to that of a dipole .",
    "thus , the topology of the magnetic field lines in the proposed pair - starved model differs from that of the force - free model ( see most recent calculation by kalapotharakos & contopoulos , 2008 ) in two major ways : the field lines in the pair - starved model are significantly more strongly collimated along the rotation axis , whereas the last closed field lines and adjacent open lines may remain closed as opposed to the force - free model where these lines may form they \" shape structure due to centrifugal force and favor the formation of a current sheet .",
    "however , the detailed comparison of field geometries in the pair - starved regime with those in the force - free / mhd regime will be possible only after we present the closed global analytic solution .",
    "we expect that the combined effects of bulk rotation and @xmath23 drift current ( see formulae [ 60]-[62 ] and [ 76]-[78 ] in mh05 ) can significantly modify the topology of field lines in the ( rotation ) equatorial region .",
    "this and other issues will be addressed in a separate study aimed at the derivation of global analytic solution matching the inner solution discussed here .",
    "we have constructed a relatively simple self - consistent analytic solution for both the magnetic field and electric current in the inner magnetosphere ( within the canonical lc ) of a ns with arbitrary obliquity and for the pair - starved regime ( see mh04 ) .",
    "our main assumption is that the so - called open magnetic field lines of a pulsar are loaded with relativistically outflowing charges .",
    "also , in compliance with the pair - starved regime , we assume that in addition to the primary electron current there is a supply of charges into the open - field region that is sufficient to feed the electric current capable of distorting the global pulsar magnetosphere . in our model ,",
    "the electric current ( @xmath123 ) is equal to the gj current ( @xmath124 ) only at the polar cap surface and varies with altitude ( see formulae [ [ jp ] ] , [ [ j1r-2]]-[[j1phi-2 ] ] ) , remaining less than the local gj current .",
    "our solution is valid within the lc ( say , for @xmath125 ) and implies the occurrence of non - vanishing accelerating electric field , @xmath63 .",
    "the self - consistent current , @xmath19 , produces the effect of collimation of field lines along the rotation axis . for the oblique rotator ,",
    "the effect of collimation is much more pronounced for the favorably curved ( @xmath126 ) than unfavorably curved ( @xmath127 ) field lines .",
    "the strongly collimated favorably - curved field lines ( for which @xmath61 ) may not allow the continuous outflow of electrons . instead , these field lines may be loaded with electrons returning back to the stellar surface .",
    "it is also possible that near the rotation axis an acceleration - free zone can be established . for the unfavorably curved field lines the effect of collimation is much weaker but capable of moving the null - surface ( defined by the condition @xmath128 ) to much higher altitudes or even completely eliminating it . at high altitudes and near the rotational equator , where @xmath129 , the @xmath23-drift current becomes important and",
    "should be taken into account .",
    "qualitatively , this effect mitigates the collimation by causing the field lines to flare further away from the rotation axis .",
    "also , this effect plays an important role in current closure and should be incorporated into a truly global solution . in addition , our solution indicates that asymptotically , when @xmath39 becomes dominant , @xmath130 , and therefore the regime of a steady - state acceleration may change to the force - free flow .",
    "thus , our solution could be used to model the transition from the pair starved regime of the space - charge - limited flow to the force - free regime .",
    "the analytic solution we presented in this study can serve as a prototype for more refined global analytic models of the pair - starved regime .",
    "we expect that in a global solution the key unknown parameters , such as e.g. @xmath96 will be more reliably constrained and related to the efficiency of particle acceleration .",
    "such a global solution will explicitly include the second - order effects we neglected in this study .",
    "hence , it would be interesting to explore , in a self - consistent manner , the effect of the bulk rotation and @xmath23-current and extend our analytic solution beyond the canonical light cylinder .",
    "also , it would be interesting to investigate the effect of a possible change from the space - charge - limited to the force - free flow , as one goes from low to high altitudes , respectively ( for the same pair - starved pulsar ) , and address the global current closure . in the next study , by using our analytic model , we will calculate the accelerating electric field within the domain of open magnetic field lines and update our previous calculations of @xmath131 at very high altitudes , so that we will be able to explicitly take into account the effects of essentially non - dipolar global magnetic structure on the occurrence and geometry of high - altitude ` slot gaps ' ( muslimov & harding , 2003 , 2004 ) .",
