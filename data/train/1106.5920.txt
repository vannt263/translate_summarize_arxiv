    "a precise understanding of the mechanism responsible for color confinement is still lacking , however there is by now little doubt that the interaction between a static quark - antiquark pair can be described by an effective string theory . from this point of view , initiated by the seminal studies @xcite , the presence of a flux tube joining the static quark - antiquark pair is given for granted and its physical consequences are examined .",
    "at zero temperature the best known consequence of the effective string description is the presence of the so called `` lscher term '' @xcite , _ i.e. _ the presence in the long distance inter - quark potential of a term proportional to @xmath3 ( @xmath4 being the inter - quark distance ) , with a known coefficient which depends only on the dimension of the space - time ( in particular it does not depend on the gauge group ) and it is not influenced by higher order corrections of the effective string action . as a consequence of these general properties , the presence of the lscher term in the inter - quark potential can be considered as a clear signature of the effective string behaviour of the flux tube . because of",
    "its theoretical interest much studies have been devoted , in the field of lattice gauge theory simulation , to detect the presence of the lscher term and to check its universal properties ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the effective string picture can be used to describe the inter - quark potential also at nonzero temperature @xmath5 ( that must clearly be lower than the deconfinement temperature @xmath6 ) : in this regime the dominant string correction to the potential is linear in @xmath4 and decreases the value of the string tension .",
    "this is temperature dependent and ultimately vanishes at deconfinement .",
    "in @xcite it was recently argued that an universal signature of the effective string at finite temperature , analogous to the lscher term at zero temperature , is given by the logarithmic correction to the inter - quark potential .",
    "this conclusion was supported by numerical evidence obtained by performing simulations in @xmath7 lattice gauge theories for various gauge groups .",
    "it was also noted that these numerical simulations are particularly time consuming , since the logarithmic correction is washed out by the projection to zero transverse momentum of the polyakov loop , a common trick used in order to reduce the statistical errors ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .    the aim of this paper is to show that the universal form of the logarithmic correction to the inter - quark potential at finite temperature ( as predicted by the effective string picture ) is consistent with the numerically generated lattice gauge data also for the @xmath8 @xmath0 lattice gauge theory .",
    "we studied the @xmath0 yang - mills theory discretized on an isotropic cubic lattice of spacing @xmath9 and volume @xmath10 with the usual wilson action @xcite @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the parallel transport along the elementary loop of the lattice ( plaquette ) oriented along the @xmath13-plane and positioned at the lattice site @xmath14 . the sum is extended over all the plaquettes .    in order to generate an ensemble of configurations with the statistical distribution @xmath15 , with @xmath16 given by",
    ", the usual markov chain monte carlo approach has been used .",
    "the updates were performed by using a mixture of heatbath @xcite and overrelaxation @xcite steps in the ratio of @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "the polyakov loop @xmath19 is defined as the trace of the parallel transport along the compactified temporal direction , normalized by the number of colors .",
    "the inter - quark potential is extracted from the correlators of the polyakov loop according to the relation @xmath20 and the correlators of the polyakov loops are computed by using the multilevel algorithm developed in @xcite together with the multihit method @xcite .",
    "when using the multilevel algorithm , usually the polyakov loop correlators at all the needed distances are computed by means of the same ensemble of configurations .",
    "this introduces strong correlations between the estimated values of the potential @xmath21 calculated at different @xmath4 s .",
    "because of the limited ram available in the hardware used to perform the simulations , we could not adopt this strategy : different runs were used to estimate the polyakov loop correlators at different distances . as a consequence the error analysis is simplified , since cross - correlations are not present .",
    "statistical errors are evaluated by the bootstrap method ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .    in finite temperature gauge theories the form of the inter - quark potential predicted by the effective string picture",
    "is given , up to an additive normalization , by the expression ( see @xcite ) @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the finite temperature string tension and the second term is the logarithmic correction we are interested in . as noted in the introduction",
    "the coefficient of the logarithmic term is independent of the microscopic details of the gauge theory and it is related only to the space - time dimensionality @xmath24 and to the temperature @xmath25 .",
    "the term @xmath26 is the first non - universal correction .",
    "the expression in has been verified with high accuracy in @xcite for different @xmath7 lattice gauge theories .",
    "since the @xmath27 proportionality of the logarithmic term in is a non - trivial prediction of the effective string model , we think it is important to numerically check also in four dimensional lattice gauge theories .",
    "in order to test the effective string prediction we used two ensembles of data generated from lattices of various temporal extents and different coupling values .    the first ensemble , which will be denoted by @xmath28 in the following , is obtained by using a lattice of size @xmath29 and coupling @xmath30 , which is the deconfinement coupling on lattices with temporal extent @xmath31 ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) and thus corresponds to a temperature @xmath32 .",
    "the second ensemble , denoted by @xmath33 , is obtained by using a @xmath34 lattice at @xmath35 .",
    "this value of the coupling is the critical one on lattices with temporal extent @xmath36 ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , thus @xmath37 .",
    "the collected statistics was of @xmath38 statistically independent measurement for each inter - quark distance and for each of the two ensembles .",
    "numerical simulations have been performed using grid resources provided by infn .",
    ".extracted values of the potential @xmath21 ( in lattice units ) for the two ensembles . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the theoretical value predicted for @xmath39 by the effective string model is @xmath40 . for the ensemble",
    "@xmath28 the theoretical expectation is thus @xmath41 , which is consistent with the measured @xmath42 . for the ensemble",
    "@xmath33 the effective string value is @xmath43 which is in good agreement with the lattice estimate @xmath44 .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 of the fit is the finite temperature string tension . in the nambu - goto effective string model",
    "this can be explicitly written as a function of the zero temperature string tension and it is given by ( see @xcite ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the zero temperature string tension . by using the values reported in @xcite for the string tension at zero temperature for the couplings @xmath48 and @xmath49 we get from the estimates @xmath50 which are consistent with the best fit values reported in .    as a last observation we notice that the coupling used in the ensemble @xmath28 , @xmath30 , is below the value @xmath51 which is usually reported for the so called `` bulk '' or `` roughening '' transition .",
    "although for some lattice actions this is a real phase transition ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) for the @xmath0 lattice gauge theory with the wilson action it is just a smooth analytical crossover , easily seen _",
    "e.g. _ in the plaquette susceptibility .",
    "this crossover signals the transition from the strongly coupled regime , where lattice artefacts are dominant and the strong coupling expansion is convergent , to the weakly coupled phase , where the continuum limit is smoothly reached ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and @xcite for the first numerical results ) .    our results concerning the ensemble @xmath28 show that",
    ", although it is defined only in the continuum , the effective string model is consistent with the behaviour of lattice gauge theories also for values of the coupling where strong discretization corrections are to be expected .",
    "the fact that the effective string description is compatible with the data also below the roughening transition is not to be seen as an internal inconsistency .",
    "since the roughening transition is not , in the studied theory , a real phase transition , its location is not a well defined parameter and the departure of the effective string prediction from the lattice data smoothly take place in a quite large interval of coupling values .",
    "the effective string model is a simple theoretical picture which encloses much of the physics of non abelian gauge theories and give testable prediction on the behaviour of the inter - quark static potential .",
    "a clear signature of the effective string at zero temperature is given by the well known lscher term .",
    "it is a recent observation that a similar role is played , at finite temperature , by the logarithmic correction to the potential .",
    "this was up to now confirmed by lattice results in gauge theory only in the @xmath52-dimensional case .",
    "we extended these results by providing numerical evidence that the same is true also for the @xmath0 four dimensional lattice gauge theory .",
    "we also noticed that the observed behaviour of the potential is well described by the effective string model also at very large coupling , where large lattice artefacts are expected to be present .    it can be noted that the data of the ensemble ii are in better agreement with the theoretical expectations than the one of the ensemble i. this can in principle be related to the different temperature ( higher for the ensemble i ) and to the lattice artefacts ( larger for the ensemble i ) .",
    "it is indeed known that the nambu - goto string description is not valid near the deconfinement transition ( see @xcite for a study of the string tension in @xmath2 @xmath0 near the deconfinement ) and it is clear that lattice artefacts are not taken into account in the effective string picture .",
    "further studies will be needed to gain a better understanding of this point and , more generally , of the limits of applicability of the effective string model to lattice gauge theory .",
