    "in the feynman gauge , lorentz invariance is obvious , but unitarity requires brst invariance for its justification . in the coulomb gauge , on the other hand , unitarity is explicit , and lorentz invariance is a consequence of the commutation relations between the generators of the lorentz group @xcite .",
    "there seems to be no role for brst invariance .",
    "that would be the case if the theory were finite ( in perturbation theory ) . however , there are two sorts of divergent integrals in the coulomb gauge : ordinary uv divergences , and _ energy divergences _ , that is integrals which are divergent over the energy integrals with the spatial momenta held fixed .",
    "each of these separately seems to necessitate consideration of brst invariance .",
    "first , the renormalization of the uv divergences requires counter - terms which do not appear in the original hamiltonian .",
    "these require brst invariance to control them ( see for example section 12.4 of @xcite or chapter 17 of @xcite ) .",
    "the renormalized hamiltonian can be got into the same form as the bare one by field redefinitions , involving for example mixing of the electric field @xmath2(the momenta ) with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "second , there are complications arising from energy divergences like @xmath4 which occur at 2-loop order ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 denote magnitudes of spatial momenta ) . before discussing such integrals ,",
    "we review the work of christ and lee and others @xcite on the operator ordering of the coulomb gauge hamiltonian .",
    "this hamiltonian contains a coulomb potential term , @xmath7 which is a non - local but instantaneous functional of the vector potential @xmath8 and the electric field @xmath9 ( @xmath10 are spatial indices and @xmath11 are colour indices ) .",
    "according to @xcite , if the hamiltonian is weyl ordered , extra terms appear in the hamiltonian , called @xmath12 and @xmath13 which are of order @xmath0 and are also non - local but instantaneous functionals of @xmath14 .",
    "it is also argued in @xcite that the feynman rules derived from a weyl ordered hamiltonian do not generate integrals like ( 1 ) . in this treatment ,",
    "the operator @xmath8 is , by definition , divergenceless .",
    "but there is another approach , which is not to weyl order the hamiltonian , and to allow integrals like ( 1 ) to arise in feynman diagrams , but seek to combine graphs so that the combinations are free of energy divergences .",
    "this was done in @xcite .",
    "the feynman integrals allow one to calculate the effective action @xmath15 . in this effective action ,",
    "@xmath16 need not be divergenceless .",
    "the theorem of @xcite was extended by us @xcite to remove the restriction that @xmath16 be divergenceless , thus effectively giving generalizations @xmath17 of the christ - lee functionals when @xmath16 is not necessarily divergencless .    in this second approach , it is necessary temporarily , while graphs are combined , to regulate integrals like ( 1 ) .",
    "dimensional regularization , which we use to control the uv divergences , is useless for energy divergences . a convenient method of regularization ( and the only one we know ) is to use a flow , or interpolating , gauge .",
    "a simple choice is defined by the gauge - fixing term @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a parameter .",
    "the coulomb gauge is then defined by the limit @xmath20 ( and the feynman gauge is @xmath21 , but this is not relevant here ) . in most graphs ,",
    "the limit can be taken before integrating ; but , in graphs involving integral like ( 1 ) , the energy integral must be done first .    in this approach ,",
    "brst invariance is necessary in order to guarantee that s - matrix elements are independent of @xmath19 , and to guarantee the lorentz invariance when @xmath22 .",
    "the brst identities in general involve @xmath23\\ ] ] and so it is necessary that all the contributions to @xmath24 must be defined for fields @xmath16 which are not divergenceless .",
    "this means that the christ - lee functions need to be generalized , as was done in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to identify the role that the ( generalized ) christ - lee functions play in a brst identity .",
    "we will use the following notation for vectors : @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the generalized christ - lee functions @xmath28 are instantaneous ( that is , independent of energies ) .",
    "we consider as an example the two - point ( @xmath1 ) terms .",
    "they contain the time delta function @xmath29    there is a brst identity @xmath30q_{j'}(k)\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is a contribution coming from the ghost dependence of @xmath24 . in this example",
    ", @xmath32 must be proportional to @xmath33 , and so the right hand side of ( 2.2 ) vanishes , and the brst identity looks just like a ward identity .",
    "since each term must be proportional to @xmath34 , we lose nothing by contracting with @xmath34 , and this is what , for simplicity , we do , obtaining @xmath35    the christ - lee term is a contribution to @xmath36 which is independent of @xmath37 and so in the fourier transform has @xmath38 .",
    "this requires @xmath39 to have contribution proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "we show that there are graphs which give the required contribution",
    ". graphs ( a ) and ( b ) in fig.1 each contain the integral    @xmath41    the fourier transform of ( 2.4 ) is @xmath42\\ ] ] containing the required @xmath43 step function .",
    "this example involves the @xmath44 graph ( a ) and the @xmath36 graphs ( c1 ) , ( c2 ) , ( c3 ) , together with the three doust graphs like ( a1 ) in fig.2 of @xcite .",
    "graph ( a ) involves the integral ( 2.4 ) . the graph ( c1 )",
    "has the energy integral @xmath45 graphs ( c2 ) and ( c3 ) are obtained from ( 3.1 ) by permuting @xmath46 , so the total is @xmath47    when graphs ( a ) and ( c ) are inserted into the identity ( 2.3 ) , expression ( 2.4 ) is multiplied by @xmath37 and the remaining parts of the integrands are identical except for a minus sign ( using the identity @xmath48 , @xmath49 being the transverse projection operator and @xmath50 ) .",
    "thus ( 2.4 ) and ( 3.2 ) combine to give the @xmath37-independent result @xmath51 .",
    "most of this result is exactly what comes from the sum of the three doust graphs like ( a1 ) of @xcite , each of which has coefficient @xmath52 .",
    "the exception is the contribution from the @xmath53 term in the projection operator @xmath54 on the @xmath55-line .",
    "this contributes @xmath56 ( the coefficient @xmath57 is defined below in ( 4.5 ) ) .",
    "we return to this contribution in the next section .",
    "this example shows that energy - independent christ - lee terms are essential for the brst identity to be satisfied .",
    "note that the energy integrals in ( 2.4 ) and ( 3.1 ) are convergent , whereas the doust graphs individually contain the divergent integral ( 1.1 ) .",
    "the role of graph ( b ) in the brst identity is not as simple as that of ( a ) in the above example ; so in the next section we verify only that the @xmath37-independent part of ( b ) satisfies the brst identity with the relevant doust graphs .",
    "in this section , we show how graph ( b ) requires christ - lee terms in order to satisfy the brst identity ( 2.3 ) . because of ( 2.4 ) , graph ( b ) ( like graph ( a ) ) has a contribution to ( 2.3 ) of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60.\\ ] ] the function @xmath61 here is quite complicated ( it depends upon @xmath62 etc . as well as on @xmath46 ) , but in ( 4.2 ) it can be simplified a lot ( using the rules of dimensional regularization , and symmetry under @xmath63 ) to give @xmath64 here @xmath65 ( @xmath66 is the colour group casimir ) .",
    "expression ( 4.4 ) coincides ( up to a minus sign ) with the christ - lee terms in @xmath36 as in equations ( 5.2 ) coming from the b and c in @xcite .",
    "another term , in ( 5.8 ) of @xcite , coming from the b graphs , coincides with the term ( 3.4 ) , left over from section 3 above .",
    "thus the brst identity is satisfied as far as the energy - independent term @xmath67 in ( 4.2 ) goes .",
    "we have not identified in a simple way how the graphs similar to ( c ) in fig.1 balance the term @xmath68 in ( 4.3 ) .",
    "in contrast to christ - lee graphs , the last , @xmath37-dependent term in the integrand in ( 4.3 ) appears to tend to zero as @xmath69 , but the behaviour of the integral is not obvious .",
    "the contribution from the ( c ) graphs in fig.1 ( before contracting with @xmath70 ) has the form @xmath71 f_2(k^2,k_0 ^ 2)+[k^2\\delta_{ij}/n]f_3(k^2,k_0 ^ 2).\\ ] ] in dimensional regularization , each of the three @xmath72 functions in ( 4.6 ) has dimensions of energy @xmath73 .",
    "_ if _ @xmath74 and @xmath75 are finite at @xmath76 , it follows that they decrease with energy as @xmath77 . from examples",
    "we have studied , we conjecture that this is the case . in this sense , the energy - dependent terms contrast with the christ - lee terms , which of course do not decrease with energy .",
    "an example of a term coming into the calculation of graph ( c1 ) is @xmath78 it may be shown that this contributes to @xmath75 in ( 4.6 ) a function    @xmath79}2^{\\epsilon}\\exp(-i\\pi\\epsilon/4)\\gamma(\\epsilon/2)\\gamma(\\epsilon-1)\\frac{\\gamma[1-(\\epsilon/2)]}{\\gamma[(3-\\epsilon)/2]}$$ $ $ \\times \\int _ 0 ^ 1 dr r^{-(1+\\epsilon)/2 } \\int _ 0 ^ 1 dv ( 1-v)^{-\\epsilon/2}\\{1-(1-v)r\\ } \\left[k^2\\{1-(1-v)r\\}-k_0 ^ 2(1+v)\\right]^{-\\epsilon},\\ ] ]    which does have the above mentioned property .",
    "we have verified that the instantaneous christ - lee terms contribute to the brst identity for the two - point functions , and identified the graphs ( ( a ) and ( b ) of fig.1 ) with which they are linked .",
