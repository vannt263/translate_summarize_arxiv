    "deterministic preparation of single neutral atoms in optical traps is a subject of interest due to their potential use in quantum logic devices . for more than a decade",
    ", different avenues have been pursued to achieve this goal , exploring different trap geometries and parameters , suitable for the various purposes for having the trapped single atoms .",
    "single atoms can be isolated using the  rydberg blockade \" @xcite or from quantum degenerate gases @xcite and individual atoms can be sorted in an array of small traps @xcite .",
    "a popular approach to trap individual neutral atoms for atomic physics experiments is by using far off resonance optical traps ( fort ) .",
    "a fort can , for example , be formed by tightly focussing a single laser beam , tuned far off the atomic resonance frequency .",
    "forts offer conservative potentials and a high level of control of a wide range of parameters .",
    "for example , the traps can be dynamically reconfigured @xcite , the trapped atoms have long coherence times @xcite , and both the long and short range atom - atom interactions can be controlled @xcite .",
    "several methods with various efficiencies have employed light - assisted collisions between atoms @xcite to ensure that a fort site is not occupied by more than one atom . of these , @xcite reported a single atom loading efficiency of 91@xmath2 in a fort .",
    "the fort was formed by a single laser beam focussed to a 1.8 @xmath3 m spotsize , which allows for an initial sample of about @xmath4 atoms on average to be loaded into the fort from a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) . then , a single atom isolation stage where a combination of in - trap laser cooling and light - assisted collisions induced by blue detuned light caused the atoms to be lost one by one from the fort until only one atom remained .",
    "naturally , a finite probability for starting the isolation stage without any atoms present will lead to a decrease in the efficiency of the method .",
    "therefore , for this scheme to be successful , it is crucial to have an initial sample of atoms large enough such that the probability of loading zero atoms into the fort before the isolation stage started is effectively eliminated .",
    "if the trap volume is decreased , the method will become inefficient since loading of high density atomic samples directly from a mot is prohibited by rapid trap loss due to light - assisted collisions induced by the mot laser light .",
    "we denote the parameter regime where the microtrap volume is so small such that it limits the efficiency of the method described in @xcite as the `` tight microtrap regime . ''",
    "@xmath3 m . ]",
    "the most dramatic manifestation of the tight microtrap regime is the collisional blockade , where the volume of the microtrap is so small such that the light - assisted collisions induced by the mot lasers cause rapid trap loss as soon as a second atom enters the trap .",
    "this prohibits or `` blockades '' the trap from being occupied by more than one atom at any stage .",
    "light - assisted collisions induced by mot lasers often result in both colliding atoms being lost from the trap ( @xmath5 loss ) .",
    "this means that as soon as a second atom enters the trap , both of the colliding atoms are lost together .",
    "previous experiments in the collisional blockade regime have therefore found approximately equal probabilities for observing 0 ( @xmath6 ) or 1 ( @xmath7 ) atom in the trap @xcite at loading times much longer than @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being the loading rate of the tight microtrap .    for some applications , it is a requirement that individual atoms are loaded into tight optical microtraps .",
    "for example , small microtraps are used to interface optically trapped individual atoms with microfabricated solid state structures to create hybrid devices @xcite and tight traps are favorable for ground state cooling of single atoms @xcite .",
    "when collisional blockade is unavoidable , the loading efficiency of single atoms has been limited to about 50@xmath2 . to enhance the loading efficiency in such tight traps",
    ", one could imagine loading single atoms into traps in the regime where the method in @xcite can be implemented , and then transfer the atom to a tighter trap , or in some cases it may be convenient to do a compression stage between the mot and isolation stage as done in for example @xcite , but here we investigate an alternative route initially proposed in @xcite .    in this work , we demonstrate efficient loading of a single atom into a tight microtrap , sufficiently small to display collisional blockade . during collisional blockade loading",
    ", we introduce a collisional loss channel in which only one of the two colliding atoms can get lost from the trap ( @xmath10 loss ) .",
    "this @xmath10 loss channel is a consequence of repulsive light - assisted collisions induced by blue detuned light , as also exploited in @xcite .",
    "the idea here is that if the timescale for @xmath10 loss can be made faster than the timescale for the rapid @xmath5 loss , then it is more likely that only one of the two colliding atoms will be lost from the trap when a second atom enters . in this case",
    ", we expect that the single atom loading efficiency can exceed the @xmath11 obtained in previous collisional blockade experiments .",
    "we achieve a loading efficiency of @xmath12 in the collisional blockade regime .",
    "our efficiency is limited by the rapid @xmath5 loss caused by the mot light , which we , contrary to the method in @xcite , can not effectively eliminate since the mot needs to be sustained during loading .",
    "our implementation relies on using the light shifts induced by the microtrap to tune the atomic energy levels of a trapped atom to match the mot laser frequency and hence , there are restrictions on which trap depths that can be used .",
    "we present an analytical model that agrees with our experiment , which describes the loading dynamics in the collisional blockade regime as a function of @xmath9 , @xmath13 and the probabilities for both @xmath5 and @xmath10 loss .",
    "our work highlights the qualitative difference between loading processes in the few- and many - body regimes .",
    "contrary to the many atom regimes where increased loss rates decrease the mean atom number , we observe that the mean atom number in the microtrap grows when the two - body loss rate is increased appropriately .    the remainder of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ s2 ] reviews the concept of @xmath10 loss induced by blue detuned light - assisted collisions previously used in @xcite and employed in this work as well . in section [ s3 ]",
    ", we introduce an analytical model for the loading dynamics in the collisional blockade regime with the presence of both @xmath5 and @xmath10 loss as well as loss not induced by collisions .",
    "section [ s4 ] describes our experiment and section [ s5 ] presents the practical implementation and measured data , while section [ s6 ] contains discussions and conclusions .",
    "a combination of laser cooling and light - assisted collisions induced by blue detuned light can lead to a two - atom collisional process where only one of the collision partners is lost ( @xmath10 loss ) @xcite .",
    "the principle of the process is illustrated in figure [ flow ] .",
    "two atoms collide with a low ( relative to the trap depth ) but finite thermal energy ahead of the collision .",
    "the blue detuned light used to induce the inelastic light - assisted collision limits the maximal energy released to @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the detuning of the light from the atomic resonance @xcite .",
    "choosing @xmath15 such that the pair of atoms after the collision has a total energy @xmath16 that is larger than the energy required for one of the two atoms to escape the optical trapping potential but insufficient for both atoms to escape , gives finite probabilities that the collision leads to none or one of the atoms escaping while the probability that both are lost vanishes @xcite .",
    "if none are lost , then the laser cooling removes the energy released in the light - assisted collision , which returns the pair to the condition prior to the collision and the process can thus repeat until one of the two atoms is lost .",
    "when an atom is lost , the other atom laser cools and remains .",
    "there are two main criteria that need to be fulfilled to achieve near unity probability for one of the two atoms to be lost while the probability that both are lost vanishes :    1 .",
    "[ c1 ] trap loss should arise only from light - assisted collisions induced by blue detuned light with @xmath15 in the right range .",
    "this means that trap loss arising from light - assisted collisions induced by light sources other than the blue detuned light , and trap loss mechanisms that are not due to collisions between trapped atoms , must be eliminated .",
    "furthermore , prior to a collision , the atoms must be in an internal ground state that has a transition such that @xmath15 is in the right range .",
    "[ c2 ] the thermal energy of the two atoms must be large enough ahead of a collision such that the pair can have sufficient center of mass momentum to ensure that they share the released energy unevenly in order for one of the atoms to gain enough energy to be lost from the trap , while the other atom stays . at the same time",
    ", it is necessary to avoid the scenario where the pair possesses a thermal energy before a collision high enough such that both of them have enough energy to escape the trapping potential after the collision .",
    "the multilevel nature of atoms and the lack of accessible closed transitions without vector light shifts makes it challenging to implement the process in practice for alkali metals .",
    "reference @xcite reports an implementation for @xmath17rb atoms where the probability of @xmath10 loss is @xmath18 , when two atoms were present in the microtrap .",
    "this was achieved as follows .",
    "the collisions were induced by a light beam ( denoted the `` collision beam '' ) that was tuned blue relative to the @xmath19 to @xmath20 d1 transition where both ground and excited states experience a largely @xmath21-independent light shift due to the trap .",
    "this ensures that the detuning of the collision beam is independent of what @xmath21-state the atoms are in prior to a collision , as long as they are in the @xmath19 ground state .",
    "since the @xmath19 to @xmath20 d@xmath22 transition is not closed , atoms may undergo off - resonant spontaneous raman scattering and end up in the @xmath23 ground state .",
    "this means that without a process that returns the atoms to the @xmath19 ground state then the population would rapidly build up in the @xmath23 ground state , leading to a change of the detuning by the ground state hyperfine splitting , thereby violating criterion ( i ) .",
    "the six cooling beams also used for the mot in earlier stages of the experiment were continuously applied during the collision stage to optically pump the atoms back to the @xmath19 ground state by shifting the frequency of these beams near to resonance with the @xmath23 to @xmath20 d@xmath24 transition for an atom at the center of the trap .",
    "please note that the shifts of the atomic transitions due to the light forming the microtrap were substantial and therefore need to be included when tuning the laser frequencies relative to particular resonances .",
    "it was empirically observed that the cooling beams tuned to the vicinity of @xmath23 to @xmath20 d@xmath24 transition for atoms at the center of the microtrap also provided laser cooling for atoms in the deep microtraps used .",
    "this was independent of the exact depth of the microtrap used .",
    "the cooling rate and equilibrium temperature depend on the power of the cooling beams with higher power giving larger cooling rates and lower equilibrium temperatures .",
    "the cooling rate should be high enough such that the laser cooling removes the energy released in light - assisted collisions that do not lead to trap loss , before the next collision happens .",
    "a high equilibrium temperature enhances the chance that an atom is lost in a light - assisted collision induced by the collision beam .",
    "however , once the equilibrium temperature reach around one tenth of the trap depth significant one - body loss due to the atom visiting the high energy tail of its distribution starts occurring , thereby violating criterion ( i ) .",
    "while the presence of the cooling / optical pumping light is necessary , this light can also induce light - assisted collisions in addition to those induced by the collision beam .",
    "this jeopardizes the @xmath10 loss process .",
    "contrary to the collision beam , the cooling / optical pumping light is red detuned by about @xmath25 ghz ( the ground state hyperfine splitting ) for atoms in the @xmath19 ground state .",
    "this means that light - assisted collisions induced by it generally will lead to both colliding atoms being lost from the microtrap , thus reducing the probability of @xmath10 loss .",
    "the suppression of this process can be understood by looking at the probability that two atoms in a collision event will undergo an inelastic light - assisted collision @xmath26 . in the regime where this probability is low",
    ", the landau - zener formalism in the dressed state picture predicts that for red detuned light , it can be approximated by @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 with @xmath29 being the on resonance rabi frequency , @xmath15 the detuning from the free atom resonance , @xmath30 the the relative radial speed for the pair , and @xmath31 a constant .",
    "we see that a combination of a large detuning and low intensity of the light that induces the collisions makes @xmath26 small .",
    "reference @xcite therefore used the minimal possible intensity of the the cooling / optical pumping light required for a suitable equilibrium temperature and cooling rate .",
    "loss due to the light - assisted collisions induced by the cooling / optical pumping light was thereby effectively suppressed , yielding a pair lifetime as long as @xmath32 s in the absence of blue detuned light .",
    "@xmath5 loss induced by cooling / optical pumping light was therefore not a main limitation on the probability that one and only one atom is lost .",
    "we seek to implement a collisional loss channel where only one of the partners are lost during loading in the collisional blockade regime . in this section",
    "we analyze the loading dynamics in the general case where loss from the microtrap can arise from three different processes .",
    "the processes are light - assisted collisions leading to one of the collision partners being lost ( @xmath10 loss ) , light - assisted collisions leading to both atoms being lost ( @xmath5 loss ) , and finally one - body loss ( @xmath33 loss ) . since we are considering the collisional blockade regime we will assume that the two - body loss processes ( @xmath5 loss and @xmath10 loss ) are much faster than the loading rate ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this means that the probability for finding two or more atoms in the microtrap at a given time vanishes , and we can restrict the possible occupancies of the trap to either zero or one . since we are interested in regimes that yield a high probability for having one atom in the trap , we will also assume that the one body loss coefficient ( @xmath13 ) is smaller than or similar to @xmath9 .",
    "we first consider the discrete series of events that may change the atom number in the trap .",
    "the first set of events is defined by an atom being loaded into the microtrap .",
    "if there were no atoms in the trap before the loading event then there will be one atom after it .",
    "if there was an atom present before the loading event then light - assisted collisions will cause one or both atoms to be lost almost instantaneously , leading to one or zero atoms present with probabilities @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "in addition to loading events the atom number can change due to one - body loss when there is an atom present in the microtrap . in order to account for this process",
    "we assume that loading events as well as one - body loss events are uncorrelated and follows poisson statistics .",
    "when there is an atom in the microtrap , then the probability that the atom number changes in an event ( loading or one - body loss ) is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the probability that the event was a loading event and @xmath38 the probability that it was a one - body loss event .",
    "similarly , one finds that the probability that the atom number does not change is @xmath39 .    when there are no atoms present in the trap the only events that can change the atom number are loading events and they will always result in that the atom number is changed to one .",
    "however , these events happen with a rate of @xmath9 whereas the total rate of events when there is one atom in the trap is @xmath40 . to simplify expressions",
    "we would like to have the same rate of events independent of whether there are zero or one atom in the microtrap .",
    "when there is zero atom in the trap , we therefore introduce a series of `` fictitious '' events with rate @xmath13 .",
    "these events do not change the atom number and therefore do not play a physical role .",
    "the probability that the atom number changes to one in an event ( loading or fictitious ) is therefore simply the probability that the event was a loading event @xmath37 .",
    "the number of atoms between events thereby form a markov chain with transition matrix @xmath41 $ ] and the probabilities for obtaining zero or one atom as a function of time is given by : @xmath42 with @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) being the probability that there is one ( zero ) atoms in the microtrap as a function of time . from a classical master equation based on the same assumptions . ] the long time steady state probabilities for detecting one ( the maximal efficiency of the method ) @xmath45 or zero @xmath46 atoms are found as the perron - frobenius eigenvector of @xmath47 ( where the expression is simplified using @xmath48 ) .",
    "this result agrees with the previous observation that @xmath49 when @xmath50 @xcite and the numerical prediction that @xmath51 when @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "we see that in order to obtain a high probability for the microtrap to be occupied by one atom , we must have @xmath53 and @xmath35 must be small . since the process is binomial , the mean atom number in the trap is simply @xmath7 and the variance is @xmath54 .",

    "figure [ fig3 ] shows that a wide range of frequencies gives efficiencies above @xmath0 but the peak performance ( @xmath92 ) is obtained for detunings around @xmath78 mhz . at this detuning , an inelastic collision releases an energy of up to @xmath93 times the trap depth , which agrees with the expectation that the optimal energy release to cause the preferred @xmath10 loss , should be enough for one of the two colliding atoms to escape but not enough for both .    from figure [ fig3 ]",
    ", we can see that the detunings @xmath15 that give @xmath94 span over @xmath85 mhz , whereas the span of trap depths ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) that gives @xmath94 is @xmath95 mhz , which corresponds to a @xmath96 mhz light shift on the d@xmath22 line transitions .",
    "this indicates that the strong dependence of @xmath86 on trap depth observed in figure [ fig4 ] originates from the mot beams strong frequency dependence on its role to perform cooling and optical pumping rather than a requirement for an accurate detuning of the blue detuned laser beam .",
    "the blue detuned beam power controls the rate of light - assisted collisions induced by it .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows how @xmath86 changes with the power of the blue detuned beam ( with detuning of @xmath78 mhz and trap depth of @xmath71 mhz ) . below @xmath97 @xmath3w",
    "we observe that @xmath86 increases with the power . at low intensities , the rate of the desired collisions induced by the blue detuned light increases with intensity .",
    "once the blue light induced collisions have a rate significantly higher than those from other laser beams , then increasing the power no longer enhances the chance for @xmath10 loss when a second atom is loaded .",
    "we ascribe the variation of @xmath98 for powers above @xmath97 @xmath3w to changes in @xmath13 as the power of the blue detuned laser beam affects the equilibrium temperature @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above we presently apply the blue detuned light in the form of a standing wave .",
    "this makes the effective power observed by the atoms drift when the phase of the standing wave drifts relative to the microtrap @xcite . to check",
    "if this limits our loading efficiencies we also tried to apply the light in form of a running wave but did not observe an improvement in the loading efficiency .",
    "we therefore conclude that the drift in the phase of the standing wave is not a main limiting factor presently .     as a function of the blue detuned beam power .",
    "the solid line is a guide to the eye.,width=340,height=226 ]",
    "our experiment shows an improvement of the loading efficiency of single atoms in tight microtraps where the collisional blockade takes effect , from the previously observed @xmath99 to @xmath87 . while the single atom loading efficiency of our work is not as high as in the related method in @xcite , the present method allows for direct loading of very tight microtraps where the method of @xcite is difficult to implement . our method may therefore provide a route for futher improvements of the loading efficiency in experiments such as @xcite that recently reported efficiencies of up to @xmath100 using similar techniques .",
    "the loading efficiency of the current work falls short of that of @xcite primarily due to the requirement that there has to be sufficient mot cooling and repump light to sustain the mot during loading .",
    "one could therefore expect that the loading efficiency could be improved if the microtrap is loaded from a reservoir of atoms held in a large volume fort instead of from a mot .    in some applications @xcite",
    ", it might be necessary to load atoms into smaller traps than ours .",
    "we do not expect this to lead to lower probabilities for loading one atom .",
    "although a smaller volume leads to a higher rate of the unwanted inelastic collisions induced by the mot light ( because the density increases ) , the blue light induced collision rate scales similarly .",
    "the blue detuned collisions can therefore dominate at smaller volumes as well .",
    "our method may thus provide a route to efficient loading of a 3d optical lattice and other geometries in a similar way that arrays of microtraps were loaded in @xcite . combining this with methods for",
    "raman sideband cooling of single atoms @xcite may provide an exciting platform for studying coherent quantum processes in few and many - body systems .    in summary ,",
    "we have demonstrated a method for efficient loading of tight optical microtraps with a single atom .",
    "introduction of light - assisted collisions with controlled energy release along with suppression of unwanted collision processes can significantly enhance the probability for obtaining one atom in the collisional blockade regime .",
    "in this regime , we observe the largest of such loading probabilities reported .",
    "the number statistics is highly sub - poissonian with a mandel q parameter of about @xmath101 .",
    "the loading dynamics is well fitted with an analytical model that describes the loading efficiency as a function of loading rate ( r ) , single atom loss rate ( @xmath13 ) , and @xmath35 and @xmath34 .",
    "our findings may be applied in quantum information processing , construction of hybrid devices , and in new ways of producing quantum degenerate gases .",
