    "the mass of the accreting white dwarf in a magnetic cataclysmic variable ( mcv ) is a fundamental property of these binary systems .",
    "it is one of the main parameters characterizing the emission from the accretion region .",
    "this is because the temperature at the shock front ( @xmath0 k ) is determined by the mass of the white dwarf , @xmath1 .",
    "the post - shock region ( the region between the shock front and the surface of the white dwarf ) cools mainly by bremsstrahlung radiation . if the magnetic field is sufficiently strong , ( @xmath210 mg ) , then a significant amount of energy can also be radiated away as cyclotron radiation .",
    "recently several groups have made estimates of @xmath1 in a number of mcvs using x - ray data .",
    "these groups have used one of two techniques to derive @xmath1 : the continuum method , where the slope of the x - ray continuum is fitted , and the x - ray line method where the intensity ratio of different emission line species is used . both of these methods have their difficulties . in the case of the line method ( fujimoto & ishida 1997 , ezuka & ishida 1999 )",
    ", this method is more suited in determining @xmath1 for low mass systems .",
    "this is because in high mass systems the lines that are used are formed close to the surface of the white dwarf and therefore do not accurately reflect the shock temperature ( cropper , wu & ramsay 1999 ) . for low mass systems",
    "this is less of a problem . in the case of the continuum method ( cropper , ramsay & wu 1998 and cropper et al 1999 )",
    ", absorption effects can be complex and lead to poor fits to the data .",
    "for low mass systems , these methods agree remarkably well : in the case of ex hya the best fit masses agree to within 0.02 @xmath3 .    in this paper ,",
    "the continuum method is used to determine @xmath1 in 20 mcvs . in a series of papers ( cropper , ramsay & wu 1998 and cropper et al 1999 )",
    ", we have added refinements to our model of the post - shock region .",
    "these improvements include adding the effects of cyclotron radiation as a source of cooling , allowing for the fact that the post - shock region is multi - temperature rather than single temperature , and adding a gravitational potential over the height of the post - shock region .",
    "while these improvements to our model do not necessarily improve the statistical quality of the fits to the x - ray data , they are essential if accurate masses are to be derived .",
    "as well as modelling the emission spectrum of the post shock region accurately , the absorption , both internal and external to the binary system , has to be taken into account .",
    "cropper et al ( 1999 ) showed that the model chosen to account for this absorption can effect the resulting value of @xmath1 to a small degree .",
    "for instance , they found some evidence that a partial covering model gave lower masses than an ionised absorber .",
    "in reality , the absorption model will be much more complex than either of these models .",
    "a more surprising result from ramsay et al ( 1998 ) was that the mass of the eclipsing mcv xy ari using _ ginga _ , _ rxte _ and _ asca _ data was significantly different in the different detectors .",
    "however , they found the mass determined using _ rxte _ data was consistent with that determined from eclipse studies . since _ rxte _ has a much higher energy response than _ ginga _ and _ asca _ it samples an energy range which is closer to the shock temperature . because of this we expect that the masses derived using _ rxte _",
    "data will be more accurate than that of cropper et al ( 1999 ) . therefore to increase our sample of accurate @xmath1 in mcvs , we have extracted data from the _ rxte _ archive .",
    "the resulting mass distribution will be compared with that of non - magnetic white dwarfs .",
    "_ rxte _ was launched in 1995 dec , its prime aim being to observe sources with maximum time resolution and moderate energy resolution ( @xmath41kev at 6kev ) . from the _ rxte _ data archive we have extracted data from 6 strong field mcvs ( those systems where the magnetic field is sufficiently strong ",
    "@xmath510 - 200 mg  to synchronize the spin period of the white dwarf with the binary orbit  the polars ) and 13 low field field mcvs ( those systems where the magnetic field is not sufficiently strong ",
    "@xmath5110 mg  to synchronise the spin and orbital periods  the intermediate polars , or ips ) .",
    "it is not the intension to perform a complete analysis of the data on each system : indeed , for several systems this has already been done elsewhere .",
    "rather , the objective is to extract suitable data from each source and determine @xmath1 .",
    "data were extracted only if the full set of data was present in the archive ( rather than only satellite slewing data which is added to the archive much earlier than the full set of data ) .",
    "data were cleaned using standard ftools procedures . to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , we extracted data using only the top xenon layer of each pca . since _",
    "rxte _ is not an imaging x - ray telescope , background subtraction is a particularly important issue .",
    "the background is not well characterised before 1996 april 15 , so we did not extract data taken before this date .",
    "the background was estimated using pcabackest v2.1b and we used the faint source models applicable to the date of the observation .",
    "table [ obs ] lists the sources for which data were extracted .",
    "it also shows the date of the observations , the exposure of the spectrum used in the analysis and the mean count rate ( 220kev ) per pcu of this spectrum .",
    "the total exposure of the observations was in most cases greater than the exposure shown in table [ obs ] .",
    "in many mcvs an x - ray spectral variation is observed over the course of the spin period of the white dwarf and/or the binary orbital period in the case of the ips . in these systems , using an integrated spectrum may result in either a poor fit to the data or may effect the resulting determination of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , in the majority of systems a spectrum was extracted which covered particular spin and/or orbital phases : this is tabulated in the last column of table [ obs ] .",
    "in addition , two of the polars in our sample are slightly asynchronous : by cam and v1432 aql . in order that a spectral variation due to the spin - orbit beat interval was not present in the resulting spectrum , we selected data covering a much shorter time interval than the beat period ( by cam : @xmath6=14.5 days , v1432 aql : @xmath6=49.5 days ) .    [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     whilst we consider this sample of accreting magnetic white dwarfs masses to be the best constrained sample to have been derived using fits to x - ray data ( using either the continuum or line method ) , a level of caution is appropriate .",
    "our model of the post - shock region has undergone several improvements which make it more physically realistic .",
    "these changes have resulted in slightly different mass estimates .",
    "for instance , applying a gravitational potential across the height of the post - shock region resulted in lower masses ( @xmath40.1@xmath3 ) for masses above 1.0@xmath3 .",
    "while we believe that the most important factors have been included in our model , other second order effects have not .",
    "for instance , it is assumed that the stream is approaching from infinity . in the case of ips , which are thought to have a truncated accretion disk of some sort , this is clearly not the case .",
    "this will have a small effect on @xmath1 . as noted above",
    ", the model we use for the absorption is not appropriate and may have an effect on @xmath1 . in spite of this , we believe that the sample presented here is the best available with which to compare masses of magnetic white dwarfs found in accreting binary systems with that of non - magnetic white dwarfs .      in our sample of polars",
    "we find a mean mass of @xmath1=0.80@xmath70.14 @xmath3 , while in our sample of ips we find a mean mass of @xmath1=0.85@xmath70.21 .",
    "taken as a whole , we find a mean mass for our mcvs of @xmath1=0.84@xmath70.20 @xmath3 .",
    "a better test is the kolmogorov - smirnov test ( k - s test ) which we can use to determine how likely it is that two distributions come from the same parent population .",
    "we find that using the k - s test there is a 81.4 per cent probability that our polar and ip samples do not come from the same parent population .",
    "we do not consider this to be significant .    to compare the combined distribution of our _ rxte _ mcv sample",
    "we compare it with 5 samples of isolated non - magnetic white dwarf masses .",
    "vennes et al ( 1997 ) determined masses for 90 white dwarfs which were detected in the _ euve _ all - sky survey ( hereafter v97 ) .",
    "finley , koester & basri ( 1997 ) ( fkb97 ) determined the masses for 174 white dwarfs which were taken from a sample of da white dwarfs hotter than @xmath425000k .",
    "a total of 52 white dwarfs had mass determinations by bragaglia , renzini & bergeron ( 1995 ) ( brb95 ) using a sample of bright field white dwarfs .",
    "bergeron , saffer & liebert ( 1992 ) ( bsl92 ) determined the masses of 129 white dwarfs selected from the white dwarf catalogue of mccook & sion ( 1987 ) .",
    "napiwotzki , green & saffer ( 1999 ) ( ngs99 ) obtained masses for 43 white dwarfs selected from the _ euve _ and _ rosat _ wfc all - sky surveys .",
    "white dwarfs which were known to be in binary systems were excluded in our analysis .",
    "we show their cumulative distributions along with our mcv sample in figure [ ks_plot ] .",
    "( 8,6 ) ( -1.5,-2.5 )    the most striking feature of figure [ ks_plot ] is that while all the non - magnetic white dwarf distributions show a peak between @xmath1@xmath40.50.6@xmath3 , our mcv sample is much more uniformly distributed . performing a k - s test on the mcv distribution and the non - magnetic isolated white dwarf distributions we find that they are different with a greater than 99.99 percent probability .",
    "there is only a 9.3@xmath8 probability that the mcv distribution and the distribution of bsl92 come from the same parent population .",
    "we now compare the distribution of our _ rxte _ mcv sample with that of non - magnetic cvs ( nmcvs ) . for nmcvs",
    "the most reliable mass determinations are those where the system is a double - lined spectroscopic binary .",
    "there are 24 such systems in the catalogue of ritter & kolb ( 1998 ) .",
    "we show the cumulative distribution of this sample in figure [ ks_plot ] . similar to our mcv distribution , the nmcv distribution is also biased towards higher masses .",
    "the two distributions are different at the 89 per cent level : we do not consider this to be significant .",
    "we now consider selection effects that can bias the mass distributions which we have considered .",
    "all samples of white dwarf masses are biased to some degree .",
    "for instance , fkb97 suggest that while studies based on euv selected white dwarfs will not preferentially select high mass white dwarfs , white dwarfs with @xmath1@xmath90.7 @xmath3that are over 400pc distant are strongly selected against since interstellar absorption will effectively obscure them .",
    "indeed , there are significant differences between the various non - magnetic white dwarf mass distributions .",
    "it is noteworthy that the euv selected sample of v97 has a relatively high proportion of high mass systems : 12.2 percent of its sample have masses over 1.0@xmath3and 6.6 percent over 1.15@xmath3 . in the case of the nmcvs",
    ", a number of studies have looked at selection effects in detail ( eg ritter & burkert 1986 , ritter et al 1991 , politano 1996 ) . for a magnitude limited sample ,",
    "the sample is biased towards more luminous objects which have a greater gravitational potential and are therefore more massive .",
    "these studies suggest that the apparent difference between the nmcv mass distribution and the isolated white dwarf mass distribution can largely be explained by this selection effect .",
    "selection effects are also important when considering our polar sample , many of which are discovered in soft x - rays .",
    "similar to euv selected white dwarfs , we may expect that low mass polars which are more distant than a few hundred pc , are selected against . on the other hand",
    ", we may expect that high mass polars are selected against for a different reason .",
    "this is because in order that high mass white dwarfs do not become unbound they must have a high internal magnetic pressure ( suh & mathews 1999 ) .",
    "polars with high magnetic fields are not included in the _ rxte _ database of polars because for high magnetic fields a greater proportion of the emission from the post shock region is emitted in the form of cyclotron radiation as opposed to bremsstrahlung radiation and are thus not strong hard x - ray emitters .",
    "liebert ( 1988 ) found evidence for this in a sample of isolated white dwarfs .",
    "other massive non - accreting magnetic white dwarfs have also recently been discovered : rx j0823.62525 , 1.20@xmath70.04 @xmath3 , 3 mg ( ferrario , vennes & wickramasinghe 1998 ) , re j0317858 , 1.311.37 @xmath3 , @xmath4450 mg ( ferrario et al 1997 ) .    while many polars have been discovered in all - sky soft x - ray surveys such as that carried out using _ rosat _ , ips are much stronger in hard x - rays .",
    "apart from the _",
    "heao-1 _ all - sky hard x - ray survey which was undertaken in the late 1970 s , no other such survey has been made .",
    "those ips discovered in hard x - rays are likely , therefore , to have been more luminous ips and therefore more massive than average , leading to a possible bias in their mass distribution .",
    "this study has found evidence that the distribution of white dwarf masses in mcvs is different from that of non - magnetic isolated white dwarfs in the sense that there is a bias towards heavier masses for white dwarfs in mcvs . on the other hand",
    "there is no significant difference between the distribution of white dwarf masses in mcvs and nmcvs . a detailed study of the various selections effects which are relevant to mcvs is beyond the scope of this paper , but such a study is needed to determine if ( as in the case of nmcvs ) selection effects can account for the apparent difference between the distribution of white dwarf masses in mcvs and isolated white dwarfs .",
    "i would like to thank the referee , boris gnsicke , and mark cropper for some useful comments on a previous draft of this paper .",
