    "<S> a number of observed phenomena in high energy physics and cosmology lack their resolution within the standard model of particle physics . </S>",
    "<S> these puzzles include neutrino oscillations , baryon asymmetry of the universe and existence of dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the suggestion that all these problems can be solved by new physics which exists only below the electroweak scale . </S>",
    "<S> the dedicated experiments that can confirm or rule out this possibility are discussed .    * </S>",
    "<S> introduction . * </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this talk is to argue that the existing high intensity protons beams , such as numi beam at fnal , cngs beam at cern and future accelerator facilities like j - parc in japan , project x at fnal can be used to search for physics beyond the sm in new dedicated experiments . </S>",
    "<S> a _ </S>",
    "<S> possible _ outcome of these new experiments could be a discovery of new neutrino states  massive neutral leptons , new insight to the origin of neutrino masses , fixing the pattern of neutrino mass hierarchy , and , eventually , discovery of cp - violation in neutrino sector and revealing the origin of baryon asymmetry of the universe and fixing its sign . </S>",
    "<S> the _ guaranteed _ outcome of these new experiments is the improving of the constraints on the couplings of new particles by several orders of magnitude .    </S>",
    "<S> the outline of the paper is as follows : first , we will discuss theoretical motivation for existence of relatively light singlet leptons ( they can be called singlet fermions , right - handed or sterile neutrinos ) . </S>",
    "<S> it comes from the discovery of neutrino masses , from existence of dark matter ( dm ) and from baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) . </S>",
    "<S> then we summarize the predictions of the properties of singlet fermions and describe the strategy for the search for these particles at existing and future accelerators .    </S>",
    "<S> * neutrino masses . </S>",
    "<S> * neutrinos have mass . </S>",
    "<S> a possible origin of this mass is the existence of right - handed neutrinos @xmath0 with masses @xmath1 , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the most general renormalizable lagrangian incorporating the fields of the standard model ( sm ) and singlet fermions has the form l = l_sm+ |n_i i _ ^n_i - f_i |l_n_i - |n_i^c n_i + h.c . , [ lagr ] where @xmath3 is the lagrangian of the sm , @xmath4 are the new yukawa couplings , and @xmath5 is the higgs boson , @xmath6 . if the dirac masses @xmath7 ( @xmath8 gev is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field ) are much smaller than majorana masses @xmath1 , the type i see - saw formula holds @xmath9^t$ ] ( for a review see @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> . the number of right - handed singlet fermions must be at least two . if there is only one of them , then two active neutrinos are massless , which is at odds with the data on neutrino masses and mixing . </S>",
    "<S> already for @xmath10 the lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) can describe the pattern of neutrino masses and mixings observed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most important parameters of ( [ lagr ] ) is the scale of the majorana neutrino masses . </S>",
    "<S> however , this parameter can not be fixed by knowing @xmath11 : multiply @xmath12 by any number @xmath13 and @xmath1 by @xmath14  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 does not change . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the choice of @xmath1 can not be fixed by doing experiments with active neutrinos only .    </S>",
    "<S> _ the gut see - saw . </S>",
    "<S> _ a popular choice for this scale is based on the following logic . </S>",
    "<S> _ assume _ that yukawa couplings of @xmath0 to the higgs and left - handed lepton doublets are similar to those in quark or charged lepton sector ( say , @xmath15 , as for the top quark ) and find @xmath1 from requirement that one gets correct active neutrino masses : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 ev is the atmospheric neutrino mass difference . </S>",
    "<S> this scale happens to be close to the scale of grand unification . </S>",
    "<S> there are theoretical challenges in the gut see - saw scenario . </S>",
    "<S> one of them is related to the hierarchy problem : the mass @xmath1 is much larger than electroweak ( ew ) scale . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one should understand not only why @xmath18 ( @xmath19 gev is the planck scale , @xmath20 is the mass of the electroweak vector boson ) , but also why @xmath21 and why @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the smallness of the higgs mass in comparison with @xmath1 would require an extra fine - tuning @xcite .    _ the ew see - saw _ ( for a review see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> _ assume _ that the majorana masses of @xmath0 are smaller or of the same order as the mass of the higgs boson and find yukawa couplings from requirement that one gets the correct active neutrino masses : @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the ew see - saw does not introduce any new energy scale besides the one already present in the sm , and , therefore , contains no new hierarchy or fine tuning problem in comparison with the sm . </S>",
    "<S> this allows a different approach to hierarchy problem , discussed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> though the stability of the higgs mass against radiative corrections gives a theoretical preference to the ew see - saw , the low - energy neutrino experiments are indifferent to the scale of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we add below two extra pieces of evidence in favour of ew see - saw , coming from cosmology .    * dark matter . * about 23% of the energy in the universe is associated with non - baryonic dm . </S>",
    "<S> amazingly , the theory ( [ lagr ] ) gives a candidate for dark matter particle , provided one of the singlet fermions is light enough ( for a review see @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , if the yukawa couplings are small as in the ew see - saw , the lightest sterile neutrino @xmath24 can be practically stable and have a lifetime which may exceed greatly the age of the universe </S>",
    "<S> .    there are several constraints on sterile neutrino as a dm candidate . </S>",
    "<S> they are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sterile ] ( left panel ) .     of dm sterile neutrino . </S>",
    "<S> right : constraints on the mixing angle of bau generating singlet fermions.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] ( -52,105)@xmath25 ( -75 , 30)@xmath26 ( -50 , 78)@xmath27 ( -160 , 80)lyman-@xmath28    of dm sterile neutrino . </S>",
    "<S> right : constraints on the mixing angle of bau generating singlet fermions.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    first , due to reactions @xmath29 etc , sterile neutrinos are created in the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> their abundance must correctly reproduce the measured density of dm . </S>",
    "<S> depending on other parameters of the lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) , the admitted region lies between two black thick lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sterile ] @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , the dm sterile neutrino has a sub - dominant radiative decay channel @xmath30 , producing a narrow photon line which can be detected by different x - ray satellites ( for a review see @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> this line has not been seen . the right upper corner in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sterile ] corresponds to the forbidden region , coming from the analysis of a number of astronomical objects by different x - ray instruments . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a lower limit on the mass of dm sterile neutrino comes from structure formation . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath24 is too light it may have considerable free streaming length and erase fluctuations on small scales . </S>",
    "<S> this can be checked by the study of lyman-@xmath28 forest spectra of distant quasars @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the region to the left of the vertical line corresponds to the excluded region @xcite , which accounts for a non - trivial velocity dispersion of dm particles .    </S>",
    "<S> an interesting feature of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sterile ] is that the admitted region is surrounded by different constraints in all directions , telling that the hypothesis of sterile neutrino as a dm candidate is experimentally testable . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the @xmath31 kev scale for the mass of dm is singled out by these considerations .    an important consequence of the cosmological and astrophysical constraints on dm sterile neutrino is that @xmath24 does not contribute significantly to the see - saw formula . therefore , the number of singlet fermions must be at least 3 , to explain the dm and observed pattern of neutrino masses and mixing angles . </S>",
    "<S> since the number of fermion families in the sm is 3 , we take @xmath32 in what follows , making the particle content of the theory ( we will call it the @xmath33msm for neutrino minimal standard model ) similar in the left - handed and right - handed sectors .    besides being a candidate for dm particle </S>",
    "<S> , sterile neutrinos may have other interesting applications in astrophysics ( for a review see @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> * baryon asymmetry . * </S>",
    "<S> our universe is baryon asymmetric - it does not contain antimatter in amounts comparable with matter . quite interestingly , the theory ( [ lagr ] ) allows for generation of bau for a large choice of parameters of the model , and in particular for wide range of masses of singlet fermions .    </S>",
    "<S> the case of gut see - saw was discussed in talk by y.  nir at this conference . </S>",
    "<S> so , we elaborate on the case of ew see - saw only . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , a pair of nearly degenerate light singlet fermions @xmath34 also leads to baryogenesis , but due to another mechanism , related to coherent oscillations of right - handed neutrinos ( for a review see @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> the light @xmath0 enter into thermal equilibrium very late due to the small yukawa couplings @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , they may be out of thermal equilibrium at all temperatures above @xmath35 gev , ensuring in this way one of the sakharov conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the coherent character of oscillations leads to amplification of cp - violating effects , to generation of lepton asymmetry and eventually to its transfer to baryons because of non - perturbative ew effects .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sterile ] ( right panel ) we present different constraints on singlet fermion mixing angle versus their mass . above </S>",
    "<S> the lined marked `` bau '' baryogenesis is not possible : here the coupling of @xmath34 to active neutrinos is so large that they come to thermal equilibrium above the ew temperature . below the line marked </S>",
    "<S> `` see - saw '' the data on neutrino masses and mixings can not be explained . </S>",
    "<S> the region noted as `` bbn '' is disfavoured by the considerations of big bang nucleosynthesis - the decays of @xmath34 must not spoil the standard picture . a small region with the capture `` dm preferred '' in the domain of masses </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 gev is quite peculiar : here the generation of bau above the ew scale and production of dm well below @xmath37 is due to essentially the same mechanism , giving a hint why the dm abundance is similar to that of baryonic matter . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the region marked `` experiment '' shows the part of the parameter space excluded by direct searches for singlet fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the published works of different collaborations reveals that for the mass of the neutral lepton @xmath38 mev none of the past or existing experiments enter into interesting for @xmath33msm region below the line `` bau '' . </S>",
    "<S> the nutev upper limit on the mixing is at most @xmath39 in the region @xmath40 gev @xcite , whereas the nomad @xcite and l3 lep experiment @xcite give much weaker constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the best constraints in the small mass region , @xmath41 mev are coming from the cern ps191 experiment @xcite , shown in fig .  [ fig : sterile ] .    </S>",
    "<S> * summary of constraints on the parameters of the @xmath33msm and its predictions . * </S>",
    "<S> the first prediction is the absolute values of masses of active neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> one of the active neutrinos must be very light , @xmath42  ev . </S>",
    "<S> this fixes the masses of two other active neutrinos : @xmath43 ev , @xmath44 ev for normal hierarchy or @xmath45 ev for the inverted hierarchy . as a result , an effective majorana mass for neutrinoless double beta decay </S>",
    "<S> can be determined @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for normal ( inverted ) hierarchy the constraints read : @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a very conservative bound on the mass of dm sterile neutrino comes from analysis of rotational curves of dwarf galaxies and reads @xmath48 kev @xcite ( it is weaker than the one coming from lyman-@xmath28 discussed above ) . </S>",
    "<S> direct experimental searches and bbn require @xmath49 @xcite , whereas baryogenesis due to sterile neutrino oscillations is possible if @xmath50 @xcite .    with quite a weak assumption about the initial conditions for the big bang ( no sterile neutrinos at the beginning ( this assumption is realized in the @xmath33msm where the higgs field plays the role of the inflaton @xcite ) the predictions and constraints can be strengthened further . </S>",
    "<S> namely the dm sterile neutrino mass should be in the interval @xmath51 kev ( the lowest bound is related to lyman-@xmath28 observations ) , the dm sterile neutrino mixing angle is predicted to be in the region @xmath52 . to produce the dm and bau in correct amounts , </S>",
    "<S> the mass of heavier neutral leptons should be in the region @xmath53 gev , their level of degeneracy is constrained as @xmath54 , and their mixing angle should be @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the cp asymmetry in @xmath34 decays should be on the level of 1% @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a direct experimental confirmation of the @xmath33msm would be a discovery of dm sterile neutrino and a pair of highly degenerated neutral leptons . </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss below how these particles could be searched for .    * the search for new leptons responsible for bau @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> * let us consider a pair of heavier singlet fermions , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> naturally , several distinct strategies can be used for the experimental search of these particles .    the first one is related to their production ( @xmath58 effect ) . </S>",
    "<S> the singlet fermions participate in all reactions the ordinary neutrinos do with a probability suppressed roughly by a factor @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> since they are massive , the kinematics of , say , two body decays @xmath60 , @xmath61 or three - body decays @xmath62 changes when @xmath34 is replaced by an ordinary neutrino </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , the study of _ kinematics _ of rare @xmath63 and @xmath64 meson decays can constrain the strength of the coupling of heavy leptons . </S>",
    "<S> this strategy has been used in a number of experiments for the search of neutral leptons in the past @xcite , where the spectrum of electrons or muons originating in decays @xmath65 and @xmath66 mesons has been studied . </S>",
    "<S> the precise study of kinematics of rare meson decays is possible in @xmath5 ( like kloe ) , charm and b factories , or in experiments with kaons where their initial 4-momentum is well known ( like na48 or e787 experiments ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the second strategy is to use the proton beam dump ( @xmath67 effect ) . as a first step the proton beam hitting the fixed target creates @xmath68 or @xmath64 mesons which decay and produce @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the second step is a search for decays of @xmath69 in a near detector , looking for the processes  nothing \" @xmath70 leptons and hadrons @xcite . to this end </S>",
    "<S> quite a number of already existing or planned neutrino facilities ( related , e.g. to cngs , miniboone , minos or j - parc ) , complemented by a near _ dedicated _ detector can be used . finally , these two strategies can be unified , so that the production and the decay occurs inside the same detector @xcite .    for the mass interval @xmath71 both strategies can be used . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , further constraints on the couplings of singlet fermions can potentially be derived from the reanalysis of the _ already existing but never considered from this point of view _ experimental data of kloe collaboration and of the e787 experiment . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the na48/3 ( p326 ) experiment at cern and dedicated experiment at miner@xmath33a site , discussed by f. vannucci at this conference , would allow to find or to exclude completely singlet fermions with the mass below that of the kaon .    if @xmath72 the search for the missing energy signal , potentially possible at beauty , charm and @xmath73 factories , is unlikely to gain the necessary statistics and is very difficult if not impossible at hadronic machines like lhc . </S>",
    "<S> so , the search for decays of neutral fermions is the most effective opportunity . </S>",
    "<S> the dedicated experiments on the basis of the proton beam numi or nutev at fnal , cngs at cern , or j - parc can touch a very interesting parameter range for @xmath74 gev . </S>",
    "<S> experiments like nusong ( see talk by m. shaevitz an this conference ) and hiresm@xmath33 @xcite should be able to explore a considerable part of the cosmologically interesting region for masses and mixing angles of singlet fermions .    </S>",
    "<S> going above @xmath75-meson but still below @xmath64-meson thresholds is very hard if not impossible with present or planned proton machines or b - factories . to enter into cosmologically interesting parameter space </S>",
    "<S> would require the increase of the present intensity of , say , cngs beam by two orders of magnitude or to producing and studying the kinematics of more than @xmath76 b - mesons .    </S>",
    "<S> msm.,title=\"fig:\",width=279 ] ( -80,165)excluded by bau ( -140 , 50)excluded by @xmath33 masses     in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : exp ] ( left part ) we present the number of singlet fermion decays expected in 5 m long detector during one year with the use of j - parc beam ( the similar figures for cngs , numi and nutev can be found in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the right part of this figure presents a length of detector necessary to observe 10 singlet fermion decays per year in x - project beam - damp . in the upper ( left panel ) and lower ( right panel ) shaded areas these particles can not explain bau , and in the lower ( left panel ) and upper ( right panel ) shaded area they can not explain the observed neutrino masses and mixings . </S>",
    "<S> the fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : exp ] shows that it is relatively easy to enter in the region of the parameters interesting for cosmology , whereas it is very challenging to explore all possible mixing angles of singlet fermions below the charm threshold .    </S>",
    "<S> the couplings of @xmath34 are too small to see them at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> inspite of this , the @xmath33msm offers a specific prediction for the search of new physics at the lhc experiments : nothing but the higgs in the mass interval @xmath77 ~~{\\rm   gev}$ ] . this comes about since in order to solve the sm problems ( in particular , the one related to inflation and to stability of the higgs mass against radiative corrections ) , the @xmath33msm must be a valid field theory all the way up to the planck scale @xcite . above the upper limit </S>",
    "<S> the theory is not consistent due to landau pole in the scalar self - coupling ( for a review see @xcite ) , whereas below the lower limit the ew symmetry breaking vacuum is not stable ( for a review see @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> * conclusions . * new physics , responsible for neutrino masses and mixings , for dark matter , and for baryon asymmetry of the universe may hide itself _ below _ the ew scale . this possibility can be offered by the the @xmath33msm - a minimal model , explaining simultaneously _ all well - established observational _ drawbacks of the sm .    </S>",
    "<S> this new physics ( a pair of new neutral leptons , creating the baryon asymmetry of the universe ) can be searched for in dedicated experiments with the use of existing intensive proton beams at cern , fnal and planned neutrino facilities in japan ( j - parc ) . an indirect evidence in favour of this proposal </S>",
    "<S> will be given by lhc , if it discovers the higgs boson within the mass interval discussed above and nothing else . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the @xmath33msm gives a hint on how and where to search for new physics in this case . </S>",
    "<S> it tells , in particular , that in order to uncover new phenomena in particle physics one should go towards high intensity proton beams or very high intensity charm or b - factories , rather than towards high energy electron - positron accelerators .    to search for dm sterile neutrino in the universe one needs an x - ray spectrometer in space with good energy resolution @xmath78 getting signals from our galaxy and its dwarf satellites </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the laboratory search for this particle would require an extremely challenging detailed analysis of kinematics of @xmath79-decays of different isotopes @xcite .    </S>",
