    "numerical simulations ( e.g. bruenn 1989a , b ) indicate that pre - sn stellar core collapses may be approximately described by a homologous process , first analyzed by gw for a conventional polytropic equation of state ( eos ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the pressure and density and both @xmath14 and @xmath0 are constant . for perturbations obeying identical eos of the background core collapse , gw explored linear stability properties of such stellar collapses and concluded that these collapses are stable .",
    "yahil ( 1983 ) extended homologous collapses to polytropic exponent @xmath15 , noting the presence of an outer supersonic envelope besides the inner core collapse .",
    "lai ( 2000 ) performed perturbation analysis to these extended solutions and claimed that perturbations are stable for @xmath16 .",
    "lou & cao ( 2008 ) substantially extended the @xmath0 self - similar solutions , including those of gw , using a general polytropic eos with a temporally and radially variable @xmath14 being conserved along streamlines .",
    "we obtained a broad family of homologous core collapses allowing @xmath14 as an arbitrary function of the independent self - similar variable .",

    "1979 ; bruenn 1985 , 1989a , 1989b ; woosley et al . 1993 , 2002 ) for the structure of massive stars and sn explosions support variable radial distributions of specific entropy .",
    "thus the model of lou & cao ( 2008 ) allows an arbitrary radial profile of specific entropy . using this general polytropic model",
    ", we conducted a non - radial adiabatic perturbation analysis and classified different perturbation modes parallel to stellar oscillations ( see unno et al .",
    "1979 and cao & lou 2009 ) and concluded that in addition to internal gravity g@xmath8modes for convective instabilities , sufficiently high - order g@xmath10modes also become unstable .",
    "cao & lou ( 2009 ) demonstrated that the criterion of using the sign of the brunt - v@xmath4is@xmath4l@xmath4 buoyancy frequency squared @xmath21 ( see definition [ defbv ] ) for the existence of g@xmath6modes remains valid in self - similar dynamic core collapses . in a conventional polytropic process",
    ", isentropic perturbations with @xmath20 make all g@xmath6modes disappear , i.e. @xmath22 . thus previous perturbation analyses ( gw ; lai 2000 ; lai & goldreich 2000 ) considered only the stability of acoustic modes .",
    "in addition to p@xmath6modes and f@xmath6modes , cao & lou ( 2009 ) found g@xmath6mode instabilities in stellar core collapses and speculated possible consequences for neutron star kicks etc .    from the existence criterion of @xmath23 for g@xmath6modes , we realize that in a conventional polytropic core collapse , non - radial adiabatic perturbations with @xmath2 should allow g@xmath6modes .",
    "such nonisentropic assumption has been invoked decades ago ( e.g. ledoux 1965 ; unno et al .",
    "1979 ) and applied to helioseismology and white dwarf oscillations ( e.g. shibahashi et al . 1988 ) .",
    "for star formation , mckee & holliman ( 1999 ) also studied nonisentropic radial perturbations in molecular clouds .",
    "they used a thermal free energy to discuss cloud stability and gave critical cloud masses for locally and globally adiabatic models .",
    "these early results motivate us to perform such a perturbation analysis for stellar core collapses and study the existence and stability of g@xmath6modes in addition to other modes .",
    "the main thrust of this letter is to show such g@xmath6mode instabilities and speculate consequences for stellar core collapses and sn explosions .",
    "the governing equations include conservations of mass and momentum , poisson equation for self - gravity and eos .",
    "the gas is ideal and the background is a @xmath0 conventional polytrope while the adiabatic perturbation with @xmath2 conserves the specific entropy along streamlines . the background collapse is spherically symmetric and as in gw , we introduce a dimensionless independent variable @xmath24 where @xmath25^{1/2}$ ] is the jeans length with a central mass density @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the gravitational constant .",
    "physical variables are cast into the following forms where the first term of each variable is the dynamic background and the last term is the first - order perturbation : @xmath28\\ , \\label{p2}\\\\ p=\\frac{\\kappa^3}{(\\pi g)^2}a(t)^{-4}f^4(x)[1 + \\beta_1(x,\\ \\theta,\\ \\varphi)\\tau(t)]\\ , \\label{p3}\\\\ \\phi=\\frac{4}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\kappa^3}{\\pi g}\\right)^{1/2}a(t)^{-1}[\\psi(x)+\\psi_1(x,\\ \\theta,\\ \\varphi)\\tau(t)]\\ .\\label{p4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the time - dependent temporal factor @xmath29 is @xmath30&\\quad % ( \\lambda\\neq0)\\ .\\ ] ] where the free - fall timescale @xmath31 is defined by @xmath32^{-1/2}\\ % \\qquad{\\rm % ( for\\ all\\ \\lambda)}\\ , \\nonumber\\\\ % & = & ( 9\\lambda/2)^{1/2}t\\qquad{\\rm ( for\\   \\lambda\\neq0)}\\ .\\ ] ] and @xmath33 is a dimensionless ` frequency ' . we do not use stream function for velocity perturbations to allow for vorticities .",
    "the dynamic collapse background is that of gw . defining a dimensionless collapse parameter @xmath34 ( yahil 1983 ) as @xmath35 where the subscript @xmath36 indicates background variables and @xmath37 is the free - fall velocity , we obtain the background density profile determined by the equation for @xmath38 , namely @xmath39+f^3=\\lambda\\ , \\ ] ] with boundary conditions @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "other background variables are then readily determined",
    ". solutions of eq ( [ core ] ) are sensible for core collapses of massive stars when density vanishes at a moving boundary @xmath42 . for this purpose",
    ", the variable @xmath43 should be negative and the time reversal operation must be taken in the governing equations .",
    "we assume adiabatic perturbations with the exponent @xmath1 different from @xmath0 . in our model , we define @xmath44 and @xmath45 $ ] for convenient analysis . after the linearization of hydrodynamic equations including conservations of mass and momentum , poisson equation for self - gravity and the adiabatic eos , the angular variation factors of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be separated out involving the spherical harmonics @xmath50 .",
    "we further let @xmath46 take the consistent form of @xmath51 where the modified transverse gradient operator is @xmath52 as @xmath53 decouples from other perturbation equations , we suppress it in the following analysis . eliminating @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    ", we obtain a set of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) : @xmath54 where the same notation is used for the @xmath55dependent factor of @xmath49 .",
    "odes @xmath56 for non - radial perturbations reduce to those of gw by setting @xmath57 and introducing a stream function for velocity perturbations .",
    "regular boundary conditions are imposed , namely @xmath58 the last of the outer boundary conditions requires a zero lagrangian pressure . with these boundary conditions , we can prove the orthogonality of eigenfunctions , i.e. @xmath59 where superscripts @xmath60 and @xmath61 indicate eigenfunctions of different eigenvalues .",
    "meanwhile , the variational principle ( chandrasekhar 1964 ) can be formulated for this eigenvalue problem .    to solve this eigenvalue problem , we use the following numerical procedure . after solving the background physical variables by using the fourth - order explicit runge - kutta scheme , we discretize odes ( [ eq1])@xmath6([eq3 ] ) with a proper mesh . then the inverse iteration method ( e.g. wilkinson 1965 )",
    "is applied to determine eigenvalues and eigenfunctions . to enhance the efficiency of the inverse iteration method , a relaxation scheme is also implemented .",
    "we first test our numerical code to solve @xmath62 isentropic cases and confirm the results of cao & lou ( 2009 ) to guarantee the correctness and reliability of the code .",
    "this check also confirms the errors of p@xmath6mode eigenvalues in gw .",
    "the spectra of eigenvalues versus the mode degree @xmath63 contain characteristic features of oscillations . a typical spectrum of @xmath64 modes is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] . in these cases ,",
    "all eigenvalues @xmath65 are negative .",

    "1979 for properties of different modes . ) .",
    "the p@xmath6modes are pressure - driven and gravity - modified acoustic oscillations .",
    "the f - modes are essentially trapped surface lamb waves ( lamb 1932 ; unno et al . 1979 ; lou 1990 , 1991 ) and decay exponentially inwards .",
    "the g@xmath6modes are driven by buoyancy and are trapped deep inside the core .",
    "the g@xmath10modes are one subclass of g@xmath6modes with @xmath64 . for a given @xmath63 , the absolute value of eigenvalue @xmath69 decreases as the radial order increases . in that limit",

    "we find similar behaviours of each perturbation mode in the core collapsing background as those in stellar oscillations .",
    "as p@xmath6modes have been studied by gw for @xmath57 , we emphatically show g@xmath10mode eigenfunctions and their eigenvalues in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .     versus spherical harmonic degree @xmath63 are shown with the parameter @xmath72 and the adiabatic exponent of perturbations @xmath73 .",
    "all eigenvalues lie in the @xmath74 regime .",
    "two dotted lines divide the region into three distinct zones for eigenvalues of different modes .",
    "there is a sign difference between the definitions of the eigenvalue @xmath65 here and in stellar oscillations ( see figures of cox 1976 for a comparison).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    modes with @xmath75 nodes from bottom to top panels with eigenvalues @xmath76 @xmath77 , respectively , are presented here .",
    "the solid and dashed curves represent @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively .",

    "eigenvalues of f@xmath6modes separate the p@xmath6 and g@xmath6modes .",
    "such f@xmath6modes are characterized by eigenfunctions of density and radial velocity perturbations without nodes .",
    "they are acoustic in nature and relate to the surface lamb waves ( lamb 1932 ; lou 1990 , 1991 ) . in stellar oscillations ,",
    "the existence criterion for both types of g@xmath6modes depends on the square of the brunt - v@xmath3is@xmath4l@xmath4 buoyancy frequency @xmath21 defined by @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are for a hydrostatic equilibrium , and @xmath1 is the adiabatic exponent of perturbation . since our numerical explorations reveal that if an eigenvalue @xmath65 with its eigenfunction can be obtained for @xmath85 for the hydrostatic limit , its counterpart can also be determined for @xmath86 in a continuous manner .",
    "thus , the existence criterion for g@xmath6modes in stellar oscillations can be applied in our analysis by using partial derivatives instead of derivatives with respect to the radius . for @xmath71 ( @xmath87 ) , g@xmath8modes appear , whereas for @xmath64 ( @xmath88 ) , g@xmath10modes manifest . for @xmath57 ( @xmath22 ) , both g@xmath6modes are suppressed .",
    "we have readily computed the p@xmath6mode eigenfunctions with @xmath89 and they appear qualitatively similar to those shown in gw and in cao & lou ( 2009 ) . we demonstrate mathematically that a g@xmath10mode does not change to a g@xmath8mode or _",
    "vice versa _ as @xmath34 increases from @xmath36 to @xmath90 , i.e. for @xmath91 , there is no @xmath92 eigenvalue for all @xmath93 . by setting @xmath92 in odes ( [ eq1])@xmath6([eq3 ] ) and after straightforward manipulations ,",
    "we derive @xmath94d^3r=0\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which requires @xmath95 . thus no non - trivial eigenfunctions can be found .",
    "consequently , the eigenvalue curve @xmath96 for each perturbation mode does not intersect the @xmath92 line .",

    "the collapse parameter is @xmath72 for the conventional polytropic stellar core collapse of @xmath0.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    a key question for perturbation analysis is the stability of a core collapse .",
    "the inequality @xmath87 for stellar perturbations is the schwarzschild criterion for convection . in our dynamic core collapse background ,",
    "we emphasize that this inequality is only sufficient but not necessary for instability .",
    "the temporal factor @xmath29 for @xmath104 bears a power law @xmath105 with @xmath106^{1/2}$ ] . for a time reversal operation",
    ", gw showed that the compression of a collapse is responsible for an amplification of @xmath107 .",
    "thus the determinant under the square root in @xmath108 decides the mode stability . for @xmath109 so that @xmath108 has two real roots , the mode is unstable for one of the two roots . for @xmath110 so that @xmath108 has a pair of complex conjugate roots , a perturbation oscillates stably in addition to the compression amplification of core collapse . by this new criterion for instability , we find that all g@xmath8modes and sufficiently high - order g@xmath10modes are unstable",
    ". it can be shown by a local analysis that the definition of @xmath5 remains valid for dynamical core collapses , such that g@xmath8modes lead to convective instabilities .",
    "it also announces that g@xmath10mode instabilities are uniquely associated with self - similar dynamic core collapse .",
    "we compare our results with earlier analyses ( gw ; lai 2000 ; cao & lou 2009 ) .",
    "first , in contrast to oscillations in a static star , we examine non - radial adiabatic perturbations in a self - similar conventional polytropic core collapse .",
    "the adiabatic exponent @xmath1 differs from the background @xmath0 , whereas earlier stability analyses of the dynamic background are restricted to @xmath57 .",
    "secondly , for a conventional polytropic core collapse , we classify different adiabatic perturbation modes , including p@xmath6modes , g@xmath6modes and f@xmath6modes .",
    "gw and lai ( 2000 ) studied only p@xmath6mode perturbations as their isentropic eos makes g@xmath6modes vanish .",
    "cao & lou ( 2009 ) obtained g@xmath6modes by a general polytropic eos with a variable specific entropy distribution , even though the perturbation eos remains the same as the background eos . in comparison",
    ", our model here describes non - radial adiabatic perturbations with @xmath89 .",
    "this leads to @xmath111 so that g@xmath6modes may exist .",
    "we indeed confirm this by numerical explorations .",
    "for various efficiencies of heat transport and radiative losses , the case of @xmath20 should be a special and rare situation .",
    "therefore g@xmath6modes should exist in stellar core collapses in general . for core - collapse sn explosions ,",
    "such g@xmath6mode instabilities should bear physical consequences .",
    "these instabilities complement those revealed by cao & lou ( 2009 ) .",
    "they occur during the pre - sn core collapse stage and should also influence the formation of proto - neutron stars and subsequent emergence and evolution of rebound shocks .",
    "at least , such instabilities lead to early breakdown of spherical symmetry before the emergence of rebound shocks ( e.g. lou & wang 2006 , 2007 ; wang & lou 2008 ; hu & lou 2009 ) . so far , most proposed instabilities occur either in a massive progenitor star prior to the core collapse ( e.g. goldreich et al . 1996 ) or after the core rebound ( e.g. blondin et al .",
    "2003 ; burrows et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "such instabilities may affect the formation , motion and evolution of a proto - neutron star or a pulsar as speculated by cao & lou ( 2009 ) .",
    "moreover , our perturbation analysis serves to link perturbations in a massive progenitor star and those after the core rebound .",
    "for example , the @xmath112-mechanism ( e.g. goldreich et al . 1996 ) may provide seed perturbations during a core collapse while such perturbations during a core collapse may stimulate those after the core rebound .",
    "we emphasize that while p@xmath6modes , f@xmath6modes and low - order g@xmath10modes are stable , if radiative losses and diffusive processes are involved instead of the adiabatic approximation , these modes might become overstable .",
    "in this letter , we examine 3d adiabatic perturbations in a self - similar conventional polytropic collapsing core with @xmath89 .",
    "the gas is non - isentropic in the sense that the adiabatic index @xmath1 of perturbations differs from that of the background @xmath0 .",
    "as @xmath1 determines the specific entropy perturbation conserved along streamlines , the non - isentropic process actually involves a nonzero buoyancy frequency @xmath5 giving rise to g@xmath6mode perturbations . in comparison , perturbation analysis of cao & lou ( 2009 ) emphasizes a general polytropic core collapse with a variable specific entropy ( lou & cao 2008 ) and 3d adiabatic perturbations of @xmath57 .    by imposing proper boundary conditions",
    ", we solve the perturbation eigenvalue problem and derive distinct modes : acoustic p@xmath6modes , surface f@xmath6modes , internal gravity g@xmath8 and g@xmath10modes which are classified by their series of eigenvalues @xmath65 and eigenfunctions in reference to stellar oscillations . in parallel ,",
    "g@xmath6modes involve two types , viz .",
    "g@xmath10 and g@xmath8modes ; their existence depends on the square of the brunt - v@xmath3is@xmath4l@xmath4 buoyancy frequency @xmath113 : the former requires @xmath88 while the latter needs @xmath114 . for adiabatic perturbations ,",
    "g@xmath10modes correspond to @xmath64 while g@xmath8modes occur for @xmath71 .    stability properties of these modes in stellar core collapses are examined .",
    "the instability criterion shifts from @xmath115 in a static lane - emden polytropic sphere of @xmath85 to @xmath109 for @xmath93 core collapses .",
    "consequently , p@xmath6modes , f@xmath6modes and sufficiently low - order g@xmath10modes oscillate stably .",
    "the g@xmath8modes are unstable leading to convections .",
    "sufficiently high - order g@xmath10modes which would have been stable in a static polytrope now become unstable for @xmath93 gw dynamic core collapse . the specific radial order that g@xmath10modes",
    "become unstable depends on the parameter pair of @xmath34 and @xmath1 .",
    "we speculate that such inevitable g@xmath6mode instabilities may offer valuable clues to sn simulations and that the formation , motion and evolution of proto - neutron stars can be nontrivially influenced ( cao & lou 2009 ) .",
    "these perturbations again lead to instabilities before the core rebound and they serve as seeds of later fluctuations .",
    "their excitations can come from oscillations of the progenitor star before the onset of core collapse . according to our numerical exploration and typical stellar parameters with @xmath116",
    ", unstable g@xmath10modes appear with fairly high radial orders .",
    "this implies that the central mass blob can be quite small and a sn might even break the core into pieces without forming a ns .",
