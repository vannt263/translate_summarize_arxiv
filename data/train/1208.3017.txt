    "in information theoretic key agreement problem @xcite , legitimate parties need to distill a secret key from a random variable in the situation such that an eavesdropper can access to a random variable that is correlated to the legitimate parties random variable .",
    "the privacy amplification is a technique to distill a secret key under the situation by using a ( possibly random ) function @xcite .",
    "the security of distilled key is evaluated by various kinds of measures . in this paper , we focus on the leaked information , which is the mutual information between the distilled key and eavesdropper s random variable ( the so - called strong security @xcite ) , because it is the strongest notion among security criterion @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix 3 ) ) .",
    "the privacy amplification is usually conducted by using a family of universal 2 hash functions @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "bennett _ et .",
    "al . _ evaluated ensemble averages of the leaked information for universal 2 families , and derived an upper bound on the leaked information by using the rnyi entropy of order @xmath0 . in @xcite ,",
    "renner and wolf evaluated ensemble averages of the leaked information for universal 2 families , and derived an upper bound on the leaked information by using the smooth minimum entropy . in @xcite , hayashi evaluated ensemble averages of the leaked information for universal 2 families , and derived a parametric upper bound on the leaked information by using the rnyi entropy of order @xmath1 . concerning the exponential decreasing rate of the leaked information , the exponent derived by hayashi s bound is state - of - the - art .    in noisy channel coding problem ,",
    "the exponential decreasing rate of the error probability is also regarded as an important performance criterion of codes , and has been studied for a long time .",
    "the best exponent at high rates is the one derived by gallager s random coding bound @xcite .",
    "however , gallager s exponent is not tight in general , and can be improved at low rates because the random code ensemble involves some bad codes and those bad codes become dominant at low rates . the improved exponent by expurgating those bad codes is usually called the expurgation exponent @xcite .",
    "similar improved exponents are also known in the context of the slepian - wolf coding @xcite or the quantum error correction @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show a security analog of above results , i.e. , to derive an improved exponent of the leaked information in the privacy amplification at low rates . for this purpose , we concentrate our attention on the case such that the random variable possessed by the legitimate parties is the binary uniform source and the function used in the privacy amplification is a linear matrix .",
    "we first consider the case such that the eavesdropper s random variable is generated via a binary erasure channel ( bec ) .",
    "for this case , we first relate the leaked information to the maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoding error probability of the linear code whose generator matrix is the one used in the privacy amplification .",
    "then an improved exponent is derived by using the result of the expurgation exponent of linear codes .",
    "it should be noted that a similar approach to relate the leaked information to the erasure error correction has been appeared in @xcite .",
    "however in this paper , we directly relate the leaked information to the ml decoding error probability , which enables us to derive the improved exponent .",
    "it should be also noted that the approach in this paper is completely different from the error correction approach conventionally used to prove the so - called weak security and the problem pointed out in @xcite does not apply to our approach .",
    "next , we consider the case such that the eavesdropper s random variable is generated via a binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) . for this case , the technique used in the bec case can not be directly applied .",
    "thus , we first reduce the bsc case to the bec case by using the partial order between bscs and becs .",
    "the reduction turns out to be quite tight .",
    "indeed , the exponent derived via this reduction is as good as hayashi s exponent below the critical rate , and strictly better than hayashi s exponent below the expurgation rate , which resemble the relation between the expurgation exponent and the random coding exponent of the noisy channel coding .",
    "our results suggest that the privacy amplification with a universal 2 family is not necessarily optimal .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first explain the problem formulation of the privacy amplification in section [ section : problem ] .",
    "then , we consider the bec case and the bsc case in sections [ section : erasure ] and [ section : bsc ] respectively .",
