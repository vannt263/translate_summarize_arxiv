    "the two lowest states in a well of this potential serve as the qubit basis . among the possible benefits of the phase qubit are its relative insensitivity to charge and flux noise and its ability to operate over a wide range of parameters .",

    "the presence of these quantized energy levels has been clearly detected by monitoring the decay of a thermal population@xcite and by microwave spectroscopy with single@xcite and multiphoton@xcite transitions .",
    "multilevel systems can , for example , be exploited for state initialization@xcite and readout,@xcite quantum logic gates@xcite and algorithms,@xcite and cryptography.@xcite however , when controlling the state of the phase qubit with a microwave current , off - resonant excitation of higher levels leads to leakage out of the desired qubit space and therefore a loss of quantum information .",
    "rabi oscillations serve as both a standard demonstration of quantum state manipulation and a diagnostic for decoherence and control fidelity .",
    "while these oscillations take on a simple form in a two - level system , several effects can occur in a multilevel system : the oscillations can distort , the higher states can become populated , and the basic resonance properties of the oscillations can undergo subtle shifts . ultimately , to achieve fast and accurate control of the qubit state , all of these effects need to be carefully characterized .",
    "progress in this area has been predominantly theoretical in nature , pointing out the conditions under which errors are introduced and methods to minimize their effects.@xcite there has , however , been less direct experimental evidence confirming the validity of models upon which these predictions are based,@xcite particularly with regard to leakage .    in this paper , we investigate the influence of the higher states of a phase qubit by examining the behavior of rabi oscillations at high power , where their impact is greatest . in sec .",

    "<S> we present rabi oscillation measurements of a nb / alo@xmath0/nb dc superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) phase qubit with a 100 @xmath1 area junction acquired over a range of microwave drive power and frequency detuning . </S>",
    "<S> given the slightly anharmonic level structure of the device , several excited states play an important role in the qubit dynamics , particularly at high power . to investigate the effects of these levels , </S>",
    "<S> multiphoton rabi oscillations were monitored by measuring the tunneling escape rate of the device to the voltage state , which is particularly sensitive to excited state population . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the observed oscillation frequencies with a simplified model constructed from the full phase qubit hamiltonian and also compare time - dependent escape rate measurements with a more complete density - matrix simulation . </S>",
    "<S> good quantitative agreement is found between the data and simulations , allowing us to identify a shift in resonance ( analogous to the ac stark effect ) , a suppression of the rabi frequency , and leakage to the higher excited states . </S>"
