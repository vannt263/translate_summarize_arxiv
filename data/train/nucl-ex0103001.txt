    "recently , detailed measurements on the @xmath14 meson production in proton - proton collisions have been performed in the previously unexplored near threshold region of the reaction channels @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there is a lack of data on the elementary @xmath17 meson production in the proton - proton scattering , especially in the region of low excess energies .",
    "the reaction channel with the lowest threshold energy is given by the associated @xmath0 meson pair production via the reaction channel @xmath18 , @xmath19 = @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , measurements on the threshold production of negatively charged kaons ( m(@xmath20 ) = 493.677 mev / c@xmath8 @xcite ) have to be carried out in the mass range of m(x ) @xmath21 1 gev / c@xmath8 .",
    "a study of this mass range is stimulated by the continuing discussion on the nature of the scalar resonances f@xmath22(980 ) and a@xmath22(980 ) , which have been interpreted as conventional @xmath23 states @xcite , @xmath24-@xmath25 states @xcite or as @xmath26 molecules @xcite . in the latter case the possibility of a @xmath26 molecule interpretation of the f@xmath22(980 ) particle crucially depends on the strength of the @xmath26 interaction , which can be probed in the near threshold production of kaon - antikaon pairs @xcite .",
    "+ exclusive @xmath17 production data are also of special interest in the context of sub - threshold kaon production experiments in nucleus - nucleus interactions , which are expected to probe the antikaon properties at high baryon density .",
    "recent inclusive sub - threshold measurements @xcite resulted in comparable @xmath14 and @xmath17 yields at the same energy per nucleon below the production thresholds for the elementary reactions @xmath27 . to explain this observation , different models @xcite consider repulsive and attractive interactions of kaons and antikaons within the nuclear medium , respectively .",
    "in addition , the antikaon potential in dense nuclear matter is closely related to open questions in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "however , for detailed calculations on the medium effects a precise knowledge of the elementary @xmath14 and @xmath17 cross sections close to the production thresholds is needed .",
    "+ we now present the first measurement of an absolute cross section on the close to threshold @xmath0 meson pair production via the reaction channel @xmath1 at an excess energy of q = 17 mev @xcite , i.e. below the @xmath28 meson threshold .",
    "angular distributions of final state particles and particle subsystems are included .",
    "in addition , one upper limit at an excess energy of q = 3 mev is reported ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "+ the excitation function is generally expected to follow the four - body phase space volume modified by the proton - proton interaction .",
    "final state interactions in the nucleon - kaon , nucleon - antikaon or kaon - antikaon subsystems as well as influences of the scalar resonances @xmath29 and @xmath30 on @xmath26 production might lead to deviations from this expectation . +",
    "measurements on the reaction @xmath31 have been performed at the internal beam facility cosy-11 @xcite at cosy - jlich @xcite , using a hydrogen cluster target @xcite in front of a c - shaped cosy - dipole magnet , acting as a magnetic spectrometer .",
    "tracks of positively charged particles , detected in a set of two drift chambers ( dc1 and dc2 in fig .",
    "[ c11 ] ) , are traced back through the magnetic field to the interaction point , leading to a momentum determination .",
    "the velocities of these particles are accessible by a time - of - flight path behind the drift chambers , consisting of two scintillation hodoscopes ( start detectors s1 and s2 ) followed by a large scintillation wall ( s3 ) at a distance of @xmath21 9.3  m , acting as a stop detector .",
    "the overall time - of - flight resolution for events with two identified protons has been determined to be @xmath21330 ps @xcite . by measuring the momentum and the velocity , a particle identification of positively charged ejectiles via the reconstructed mass determination is possible and the four momentum vector can be completely determined .",
    "+ the event selection for the reaction @xmath31 was performed by accepting three - track events with two identified protons and one particle identified as a @xmath14 meson . with respect to the short lifetime and the opening angle of kaons in the laboratory system ,",
    "an indirect time - of - flight measurement was used for the kaon identification . by calculating the start time of the event in the target via the precisely determined proton trajectories and velocities , the kaon hit in the start detectors",
    "is used as stop signal .",
    "the quality of this method is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ invmk ] with a clearly identified kaon peak .",
    "+ the four - momentum determination of the positively charged ejectiles yields a full event reconstruction for the reaction type @xmath32 and allows an identification of the undetected x - particle system using the missing mass method .",
    "the result of the measurements at an excess energy of q = 17 mev with respect to the @xmath0 threshold is shown in fig .",
    "[ mmppk ] ( upper spectrum , thin line ) .",
    "as expected from monte - carlo simulations using the code geant-3 @xcite , including the phase - space event generator genbod , a sharp peak at the charged kaon mass with a missing mass resolution of fwhm @xmath21 2 mev / c@xmath8 is obvious , corresponding to an unambiguous detection of events from the @xmath33 reaction .",
    "the broad distribution in the region of lower missing masses can be explained by contributions from @xmath34 events , misidentifying pions as @xmath14 mesons .",
    "furthermore , the production of heavier hyperons , in particular @xmath35 and @xmath36 , may contribute to this background . at the discussed beam energy these hyperons",
    "can be produced via the reactions @xmath37 .",
    "taking into account decay channels with one decay proton in the final state , these events can also show the requested signature of two protons and one @xmath14 .",
    "however , due to the decay modes of these hyperons , here the system @xmath19 of the reaction @xmath32 consists of more than only one particle . therefore , the missing mass distribution of the @xmath38 system originating from these reaction channels results in a broad distribution .",
    "+ in order to reproduce the observed broad missing mass distribution , both mentioned contributions have been considered . for this purpose ,",
    "@xmath34 events have been analyzed , assuming for the @xmath39 mesons the mass of charged kaons .",
    "furthermore , using for simplicity only s - waves , phase space monte - carlo simulations on the hyperon production , applying the properties of the @xmath36 hyperon ( mass m = 1383.7 mev / c@xmath8 , width @xmath40 = 36 mev / c@xmath8 @xcite ) and isotropic angular distributions have been carried out .",
    "the combination of both contributions can be seen in fig .",
    "[ mmppk ] ( thick line ) .",
    "obviously , these two effects , the misidentification of @xmath41 events and the production of heavier hyperons , are sufficient to reproduce the background distribution .",
    "it should be emphasized that the background contamination in the @xmath17 peak area is in any case very small , leading finally to a total number of n = 61@xmath42 accumulated @xmath0 events . + for a further verification of the @xmath0 assignment",
    ", a silicon pad detector , mounted inside the cosy dipole magnet , has been used to determine the hit position of outgoing @xmath17 mesons . since the four - momentum vector of the @xmath17 meson is accessible via the completely determined @xmath38 system , the hit position in the silicon pad detector can be predicted .",
    "taking into account only events of the @xmath17 peak of fig .",
    "[ mmppk ] ( upper spectrum ) , the expected hit positions are compared with the measured ones , as seen in fig",
    ".  [ korr ] ( filled symbols ) .",
    "the upright dash - dotted lines indicate the region of the silicon pad detector , which can be hit by @xmath17 mesons originating from the @xmath0 production at q = 17 mev excess energy . based on monte - carlo simulations ,",
    "the dashed lines specify the 3@xmath43 region for the deviation of the measured hit position from the calculated one ( @xmath21 @xmath44 13.7 cm ) . obviously , except for one event all events marked by filled symbols fulfill these requirements , giving additional and independent evidence for the exclusive @xmath17 production .",
    "contrary to this , events from the broad structure of fig .",
    "[ mmppk ] show no correlation between the measured and expected hit positions ( open symbols ) . due to",
    "geometrical acceptance only a few of these events have a hit in the pad detector at all .",
    "+ taking into account only @xmath38 events with an additional @xmath17 candidate fulfilling the @xmath17 hit correlation ( fig .",
    "[ korr ] ) , the primary missing mass distribution of @xmath38 events reduces to the lower spectrum of fig .",
    "[ mmppk ] .",
    "this procedure leads , consistent with monte - carlo calculations to i ) a drastic reduction of the broad structure and ii ) to a 43% decrease of the counting rate for the @xmath17 signal due to acceptance and decay losses .",
    "according to these results , the events represented by the @xmath17 peaks can be identified as @xmath33 events with hardly any background contamination .",
    "in the following analysis we use the events of the @xmath17 peak of the upper spectrum of fig .",
    "[ mmppk ] . + in addition to the non - resonant production of @xmath0 events",
    ", we also consider the possibility , that the selected events originate from other reaction channels leading to the same final state particles . as discussed above , the production of heavy hyperons like the @xmath35 and the @xmath45 is of minor importance , since it appears only as a small background below a clear @xmath0 signal ( see fig .",
    "[ mmppk ] ) .",
    "different to this it is more difficult to unravel the contribution of the scalar resonances @xmath29 and/or @xmath30 from which the higher energy part of these broad resonances might decay into @xmath0 pairs @xcite . due to the masses of the @xmath4- and @xmath5-resonances ( m(@xmath4 ) = 980 mev / c@xmath8 @xmath44 10 mev / c@xmath8 and m(@xmath5 ) = 984.8 mev / c@xmath8 @xmath44 1.4 mev / c@xmath8 ) and their large widths ( @xmath40(@xmath4 ) = 40 mev / c@xmath8 to 100 mev / c@xmath8 and @xmath40(@xmath5 ) = 50 mev / c@xmath8 to 100 mev / c@xmath8 ) @xcite , kinematical distributions of both the resonant and the non - resonant channels are expected to be similar .",
    "the shape of the @xmath46-missing mass distribution is sensitive to the assumed reaction channel and therefore offers the possibility to investigate contributions from resonant production .",
    "however , the available statistics of the extracted @xmath0 events at q = 17 mev is not sufficient to distinguish between four - body phase space and predictions on the resonant production .",
    "since the structures of the @xmath5(980 ) and @xmath4(980 ) are rather similar with respect to their effect concerning the limited acceptance of cosy-11 , we only consider the @xmath4(980 ) in the further discussion .",
    "+ the accessibility of the four - momentum vectors of all ejectiles from @xmath33 events allows to study angular distributions of the particles or particle systems .",
    "monte - carlo simulations on the free @xmath47 reaction , considering also the @xmath46 fsi and the coulomb interaction , have been performed to determine the acceptance of the detection system in order to obtain acceptance corrected kinematical distributions .",
    "the overall detection efficiencies for events from the non - resonant @xmath0 production , requiring the detection of both protons and the @xmath14 meson , were determined to be @xmath48(3 mev ) = @xmath49 and @xmath48(17 mev ) = @xmath50 .",
    "these quantities take into account the kaon decay , detection and track reconstruction efficiencies as well as the influence of the error in the absolute excess energies , which are known with a precision of @xmath51q = 1 mev , caused by the uncertainty in the determination of the absolute cosy beam momentum ( @xmath52 = @xmath53 ) . in fig .",
    "[ winkel ] angular distributions in the center of mass system relative to the beam direction are shown for the extracted @xmath33 events for both outgoing protons ( a ) , the @xmath0 system ( b ) , the @xmath14 mesons ( c ) and the @xmath17 mesons ( d ) .",
    "within the statistical errors the measured distributions of the protons and the kaons show no significant deviation from an isotropic emission .",
    "+ the luminosity was determined by comparing the differential counting rates of elastically scattered protons with data obtained by the edda collaboration @xcite .",
    "the integrated luminosities were extracted to be @xmath54 = 841 nb@xmath55(stat.)@xmath56(syst . ) at q = 3 mev and @xmath54 = 4.50 pb@xmath55(stat.)@xmath56(syst . ) at q = 17 mev , corresponding to a mean luminosity of @xmath57 = 2 @xmath58 @xmath59s@xmath60 .",

    "[ kkwq ] the present result at q = 17 mev ( filled symbol ) and a data point from the disto collaboration @xcite , neglecting the contribution from @xmath28 , are plotted as function of the excess energy .",
    "these data represent the available world data for the @xmath0 production via the reaction channel @xmath61 in the near threshold region ( threshold : p@xmath62 = 3.30175 gev / c ) .",
    "+ the total cross section at an excess energy of q = 17@xmath631 mev has been determined to be @xmath43 = ( 1.80@xmath440.27@xmath64 ) nb , including statistical and systematical errors , respectively @xcite . the overall systematical error arises from uncertainties in the determination of the detection efficiency ( 8% ) , the luminosity ( 5% ) , the cosy beam momentum ( @xmath65 ) as well as different models for the proton - proton fsi @xcite ( 2% ) . from each of the four angular distributions in fig .",
    "[ winkel ] the total cross section was deduced and resulted in an additional error contribution of @xmath66 where the influence of the few background counts in the @xmath17 peak is included .",

    "[ kkwq ] shows parametrizations on the @xmath0 cross sections assuming different production processes .",
    "the solid line , representing a fit to the data points on the basis of a four - body s - wave phase space expectations including the proton - proton final state interaction ( fsi ) , describes the data points adequately within the error bars .",
    "therefore , the total cross section data points are consistent with a description based on the free @xmath33 production with no distinct effects of higher partial waves or strong @xmath0 final state interactions .",
    "although not suggested by our previously discussed results , one can calculate the cross section for the @xmath68 channel , leading to a value of @xmath69 nb .",
    "correspondingly , the dashed lines present three - body phase space calculations for the @xmath33 final state via the excitation of the broad @xmath4 resonance including the @xmath46 fsi and normalized to this @xmath70 .",
    "here we assumed the @xmath29 to be a breit - wigner distribution with a mass of m = 980 mev / c@xmath8 .",
    "the effect of the large uncertainty about the width of the @xmath4(980 ) resonance ( @xmath40 = 40 mev / c@xmath8 to 100 mev / c@xmath8 @xcite ) is indicated by the dashed area .",
    "nevertheless , within the error bars also this description is consistent with the measured data .",
    "consequently , the two data points are in agreement with both the assumption of a non - resonant as well as a resonant production via the @xmath4 , always neglecting effects of higher partial waves .",
    "at the cosy-11 facility the near threshold @xmath0 production in the reaction channel @xmath71 has been studied at an excess energy of q = 17 mev . approximately sixty @xmath0 events have been extracted , leading to a total cross section of @xmath43 = 1.80 nb . as a remarkable result",
    "we obtain , at same excess energies , a @xmath17 cross section differing from the @xmath14 cross section by approximately two orders of magnitude .",
    "+ the emission angle distributions of the ejectiles in the center of mass system show no significant deviation from expectations based on pure four body phase space simulations .",
    "the excitation function of available close to threshold data on this reaction channel can be described both by calculations based on the four - body phase space including effects of the @xmath46 fsi and the coulomb interaction as well as by calculations based on three - body phase space considerations via the broad @xmath4 resonance including the @xmath46 fsi .    * acknowledgements * +   + we appreciate the work provided by the cosy operating team and thank them for the good cooperation and for delivering an excellent proton beam .",
