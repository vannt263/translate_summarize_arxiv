    "magnesium is composed of three stable isotopes @xmath5 mg , @xmath6 mg and @xmath7 mg , which can be formed in massive stars ( e.g. woosley & weaver 1995 ; hereafter ww1995 ) . the lightest isotope is formed as a primary isotope from h , while @xmath0 mg are formed as secondary isotopes .",
    "the heaviest mg isotopes are also produced in intermediate - mass agb stars ( karakas & lattanzio 2003 ) , so the isotopic ratios @xmath0mg/@xmath5 mg increase with the onset of agb stars .",
    "therefore , mg isotopic ratios in halo stars could be used to constrain the rise of agb stars in our galaxy .",
    "it is important to know when agb stars begin to enrich the halo in order to disentangle the contribution of elements produced by intermediate - mass stars from those produced by masssive stars .",
    "for example , the high nitrogen abundances observed in metal - poor stars can be explained by fast - rotating massive stars ( chiappini , matteucci & ballero 2005 ; chiappini et al .",
    "2006 ) or alternatively by intermediate - mass stars , although the latter option may be unlikely because those stars may not have had time to enrich the halo due to their longer lifetime .",
    "mg isotopic abundances can be obtained from the analysis of mgh lines in cool stars .",
    "after the early work of boesgaard ( 1968 ) and bell & branch ( 1970 ) , other studies have increased the coverage in metallicity down to [ fe / h ] = @xmath81.8 ( tomkin & lambert 1980 ; lambert & mcwilliam 1986 ; barbuy 1985 , 1987 ; barbuy , spite & spite 1987 ; mcwilliam & lambert 1988 ; gay & lambert 2000 ) .    in order to reach lower metallicities ( [ fe / h ] @xmath92 ) , very metal - poor cool dwarfs have to be discovered .",
    "this work was undertaken by yong & lambert ( 2003a , b ) , who found a number of metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath92 ) cool dwarfs ( t@xmath10 @xmath11 5000 k ) useful for mg isotopic studies . employing that sample , yong , lambert & ivans ( 2003 , hereafter yli2003 )",
    "were able to study @xmath0mg/@xmath5 mg ratios down to [ fe / h ] = @xmath82.5 .",
    "surprisingly , they found metal - poor stars with relatively high @xmath0mg/@xmath5 mg ratios , suggesting thus an important contribution by intermediate - mass agb stars even at such low metallicities ( fenner et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter f2003 ) .    in this work ,",
    "we determine mg isotopic ratios in cool halo dwarfs and constrain the rise of intermediate - mass agb stars by comparing the observed ratios with chemical evolution models .",
    "the sample was selected from previous spectroscopic analyses of metal - poor cool dwarfs ( yong & lambert 2003a , b ) .",
    "five metal - poor stars were chosen covering the range @xmath1 [ fe / h ] @xmath121.3 : g 69 - 18 ( lhs 1138 ) , g 83 - 46 ( lhs 1718 ) , g 103 - 50 , g 63 - 40 ( lhs 2765 ) and the well - known moderately metal - poor dwarf hd 103095 , with [ fe / h ] = @xmath82.6 , @xmath82.6 , @xmath82.2 , @xmath81.9 and @xmath81.3 , respectively .    the observations were obtained with hires ( vogt et al .",
    "1994 ) at the keck i telescope .",
    "the first set of spectra was taken in august 2004 , just a few days after a hires upgrade , taking thus advantage of improvements in efficiency , spectral coverage and spectral resolution .",
    "a resolving power of r @xmath13 was achieved using a 0.4-wide slit .",
    "additional observations were obtained in november 2004 and june 2005 .",
    "the spectral orders were extracted with makee and iraf was used for further data reductions ( doppler correction , continuum normalization and combining spectra ) .",
    "two sample stars ( g 83 - 46 and g 103 - 50 ) turned out to be double lined stars , with g 103 - 50 being a spectroscopic binary ( latham et al .",
    "these two stars were discarded from the analysis .",
    "three wavelength regions at 5134.6 , 5138.7 and 5140.2   are usually employed to determine the isotopic abundance ratios @xmath0mgh/@xmath5mgh ( e.g. mcwilliam & lambert 1988 ; yli2003 ) . for these regions we adopted laboratory fts measurements of the isotopic @xmath14mgh lines obtained by bernath , black & brault ( 1985 ) .",
    "in addition , outside the recommended regions , laboratory wavenumbers for @xmath5mgh were taken from bernath et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , and the corresponding @xmath0mgh line positions were computed by adding the theoretical isotopic shifts to the laboratory @xmath5mgh wavenumbers .",
    "the @xmath0mgh isotopic shifts were calculated using the relative reduced mass of @xmath0mgh to @xmath5mgh .",
    "the energy levels were calculated using molecular constants by shayesteh et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and we adopted a dissociation energy of 1.27 ev ( balfour & lindgren 1978 ) .",
    "oscillator strengths were obtained from transition probabilities given by weck et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "molecular c@xmath15 lines are also present in the same region , so a line list of c@xmath15 lines was also implemented .",
    "laboratory wavenumbers were taken from amiot ( 1983 ) and prasad & bernath ( 1994 ) .",
    "the rotational strengths ( hnl - london factors ) were computed following kovacs ( 1961 ) , and we adopted an oscillator band strength of @xmath16 = 0.03 ( see grevesse et al .",
    "excitation potentials were computed using the molecular constants by prasad & bernath ( 1994 ) and a dissociation energy of 6.297 ev ( urdahl et al .",
    "1991 ) was adopted .",
    "atomic lines present in the region were also included .",
    "the initial line list was based in the work of barbuy ( 1985 ) , and lines were added or discarded based on spectral synthesis of both the sun and arcturus spectra .    in previous works the macroturbulence has been determined mainly using two lines : 5115.4   and 5145.5    ( e.g. mcwilliam & lambert 1988 ; yli2003 ) . for the two more metal - poor stars in our sample",
    "these lines became too weak , so we additionally used lines of and present in the 5569 - 5601   region .    for the atomic lines we adopted transition probabilities from the nist database ; astrophysical _",
    "gf_-values were derived when no entry was available .",
    "the stellar parameters ( t@xmath10 , log g , [ fe / h ] , v@xmath17 ) were initially adopted from melndez & barbuy ( 2002 ) for hd 103095 , and from yong & lambert ( 2003b ) for the other two stars .",
    "a check of the stellar parameters was done employing the irfm t@xmath10 calibrations by ramrez & melndez ( 2005 ) , hipparcos parallaxes , y@xmath18 isochrones ( demarque et al .",
    "2004 ) and our hires spectra .",
    "e(b - v ) was estimated both using interstellar d lines and reddening maps ( @xmath194.1 of melndez et al .",
    "2006 ) . reasonable agreement was found with respect to the stellar parameters given in the above references .",
    "our final adopted values are given in table 1 .",
    "once the stellar parameters were set , the macroturbulence was determined employing the 5115.4   and 5145.5   lines , as well as and lines around 5569 - 5601  .",
    "the contribution of c@xmath15 lines was constrained by spectral synthesis of the weak feature around 5135.7  , which is a blend of c@xmath15 lines ( 5135.57 and 5135.69  ) sometimes blended with an unidentified line in the red side ( gay & lambert 2000 ) .",
    "fortunately the observations are of such high resolution that it is possible to constrain the contribution of c@xmath15 employing the blue side of this feature , imposing thus an upper limit to blends by c@xmath15 lines .",
    "the mg isotopic ratios were determined using spectral synthesis .",
    "after the first trials it was clear that the @xmath0 mg isotopic ratios were lower than 5% , i.e. , much lower than the terrestrial ratios ( 79:10:11 ) .",
    "the computed synthetic spectra have isotopic ratios ranging from @xmath5mg:@xmath6mg:@xmath7mg=100:0:0 to 90:5:5 .",
    "initially the mg isotopic ratios were determined by an eye - fit of the synthetic spectra to the hires observed data of the three recommended regions ( see @xmath193 ) .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 .",
    "after the fits by eye were completed we performed a @xmath20 fit by computing @xmath20 = @xmath21(@xmath22)/@xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 represents the observed and synthetic spectrum , respectively , and @xmath26 = ( s / n)@xmath27 .",
    "as an example of the @xmath20 fits we show in fig .",
    "1 the fits for the recommended region at 5140.2   in the most metal - rich and most metal - poor stars of our sample .",
    "the results of the @xmath20 fits are shown in table 1 . as can be seen ,",
    "the eye fit compares well to the @xmath20 fit .",
    "the errors given in table 1 are due to statistical errors ( the standard deviation between the isotopic ratios of the three recommended regions ) and systematic errors of 1% ( due to errors in the atmospheric parameters , see e.g. yli2003 ) . our results for hd 103095 ( @xmath5mg:@xmath6mg:@xmath7",
    "mg = 94.8:2.4:2.8 ) compare very well with previous visual ( eye - fit ) determinations in the literature . for hd 103095 both tomkin & lambert ( 1980 ) and barbuy ( 1985 ) obtained isotopic ratios of 94:3:3 .",
    "more recently gay & lambert ( 2000 ) determined 93:4:3 .",
    "here we discuss how our isotopic ratios compare with chemical evolution models .",
    "we compare only the ratio @xmath7mg/@xmath5 mg , since the isotopic ratio for @xmath6 mg is more uncertain due to the smaller isotopic shift .    in fig .",
    "2 ( left panel ) we compare our results with the models computed by f2003 , both including and neglecting the contribution of intermediate - mass agb stars . another model ( alibs , labay & canal 2001 , hereafter alc2001 ) which includes only massive stars",
    "is also shown . a comparison with other models ( ashenfelter , mathews & olive 2004 , hereafter amo2004 ; goswami & prantzos 2000 ) is shown in the right panel .",
    "as can be seen , our low isotopic ratios can be explained mostly by massive stars , thus we find no need to invoke the contribution of intermediate - mass agb stars at low metallicities .",
    "hd 103095 lies slightly above the predicted f2003 curve of massive stars nucleosynthesis ( although it is in perfect agreement with the alc2001 model ) , so this may indicate that at [ fe / h ] @xmath41.5 the contribution from agb stars begins .",
    "the high isotopic ratios found in metal - poor stars by yli2003 were interpreted by f2003 as an important contribution of intermediate - mass agb stars at low metallicities .",
    "however , most of the stars with high isotopic @xmath28mg / mg ratios in yli2003 are not bona fide halo dwarfs .",
    "we computed the probability of halo membership following bensby , feltzing & lundstrm ( 2003 ) and found that a fraction of the metal - poor stars in yli2003 are actually thick disk stars .",
    "furthermore , some halo stars have abundance anomalies ( e.g. ch stars ) or their spectra are abnormal ( e.g. double lined ) , and they should be removed for a fair comparison with chemical evolution models .    after eliminating the probable thick disk stars , as well as halo stars with anomalies , we find that only 4 bona fide halo dwarfs remain from the yli2003 sample :",
    "g 39 - 36 , lhs 3780 , g 113 - 40 and g 86 - 39 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "2 ( right panel ) , the results of yli2003 are in excellent agreement with ours .",
    "we have done a similar exercise with the sample of gay & lambert ( 2000 ) and found that the only good unevolved halo star is hd 103095 , which is already included in our sample .",
    "lambert & mcwilliam ( 1986 ) have analyzed the metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath81.5 ) subgiant @xmath29 ind , for which they obtained only upper limits of @xmath28mg / mg @xmath30 3% .",
    "thus both our results and yli2003 suggest a small ( or none ) @xmath28 mg contribution of intermediate - mass agb stars to the galactic halo .",
    "perhaps the @xmath28 mg yields from agb stars are lower than in current models ( karakas & lattanzio 2003 ) .",
    "if this is the case , then intermediate - mass agb stars can not be invoked to explain the possible variation of the fine - structure constant @xmath31 ( amo2004 ) .",
    "the chemical evolution models used to explain variations in @xmath31 require an ad - hoc agb - enhanced imf in order to produce large amounts of @xmath28 mg ( amo2004 ) .",
    "if the correct yields are lower than present calculations , then much larger ad - hoc modifications to the imf would be required .",
    "calculations of karakas & lattanzio ( 2003 ) show that the agb stars that contribute significant amounts of @xmath28 mg are stars with initial masses of 3 - 6 m@xmath32 .",
    "since these stars have lifetimes considerably shorter than the age of the universe , they can be used to constrain the timescale for the formation of the galactic halo .",
    "according to the padova evolutionary tracks the lifetime of 3 - 6 m@xmath32 metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath81.5 ) are 0.1 - 0.3 gyr , so the halo timescale formation should be of the order of 0.3 gyr .",
    "this short timescale probably explains why recent studies of age spread in galactic globular clusters have shown that most clusters from intermediate to low metallicity are coeval within the uncertainties ( e.g. rosenberg et al .",
    "1999 ; de angeli et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath28mg / mg ratios in halo dwarfs are low and that there is no need to invoke a contribution from intermediate - mass agb stars at low metallicities",
    ".    further high s / n high spectral resolution observation of a larger sample will help constrain the rise of agb stars in the galaxy and will be useful to better constrain the formation timescale of the galactic halo .",
