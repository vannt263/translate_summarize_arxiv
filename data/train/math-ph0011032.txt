    "in this paper we consider random schrdinger operators @xmath0 in @xmath1 of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a sequence of i.i.d .",

    "we always suppose that the single - site potential @xmath7 is piecewise continuous with @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "moreover , we require that @xmath9",
    ". the spectral properties of ( [ 1.1 ] ) were studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "the results are most complete for the case when @xmath7 is the point interaction ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the main idea of our approach is to approximate the operator @xmath0 ( [ 1.1 ] ) by means of the sequence @xmath10 with unchanged @xmath11 , which converges to @xmath0 in the strong resolvent sense .",
    "this approximation gives the opportunity to use scattering theory in order to study the spectral properties of the limiting operator ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , we show how to recover the spectral characteristics of @xmath0 from the limiting behaviour of the spectral characteristics of @xmath12 in the  large support \" limit @xmath13 .",
    "one of the important ingredients of our approach is the lifshitz - krein spectral shift function ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "recently it has received renewed interest due to its applications to different problems in the theory of schrdinger operators @xcite . in the context of our approach",
    "the spectral shift function naturally replaces the eigenvalue counting function , which is usually used to construct the density of states for the operator ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "the celebrated birman - krein theorem @xcite relates the spectral shift function to scattering theory .",
    "in fact , up to a factor @xmath14 it may be identified with the scattering phase for the pair ( @xmath12 , @xmath11 ) , i.e. @xmath15 when @xmath16 , @xmath17 here @xmath18 and @xmath19 have the meaning of transmission and reflection coefficients , respectively , such that @xmath20 . for @xmath21 @xmath22",
    "equals minus the counting function of @xmath12 .",
    "these two properties of the spectral shift function , namely its relation to scattering theory and its replacement of the counting function in the presence of an absolutely continuous spectrum convinced the authors already some time ago that the spectral shift function could be applied to the theory of random schrdinger operators .",
    "in fact , our previous articles @xcite were in part preparatory investigations aiming at such an application .",
    "in @xcite we proved convexity and subadditivity properties of the spectral shift function with respect to the potential and the coupling constant , respectively .",
    "such properties often show up when considering thermodynamic limits in statistical mechanics . in @xcite",
    "we studied cluster properties when the potential is a sum of two terms and the center of one is moved to infinity .",
    "again such properties play an important role in statistical mechanics as well as in quantum field theory .",
    "possible applications of the theory of the spectral shift function to random schrdinger operators have also been envisaged by simon @xcite .",
    "some other applications of the scattering theory in one dimension to the study of spectral properties of schrdinger operators with periodic or random potentials can be found in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "below we prove some new inequalities for the spectral shift function , which reflect its `` additivity '' properties with respect to the potential being the sum of two terms with disjoint supports .",
    "these inequalities are closely related to the aktosun factorization formula ( [ aktosun.form ] ) @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . combined with the superadditive ergodic theorem they will allow us to prove the almost sure existence of the limit @xmath23 which we call the spectral shift density .",
    "we prove the equality @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26^{1/2}$ ] are the integrated density of states of the hamiltonians @xmath0 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "also we reconsider the aktosun factorization formula and show that it is a direct consequence of the propagator property of the fundamental ( or transfer ) matrix of the schrdinger equation .",
    "another very important quantity associated with the hamiltonian ( [ 1.1 ] ) is the lyapunov exponent @xmath27 .",
    "in particular , according to the ishii - pastur - kotani theorem @xcite the set @xmath28 is the essential support of the absolute continuous part of the spectral measure for @xmath0 ( [ 1.1 ] )",
    ".    we will establish that for @xmath16 the function @xmath29 can be interpreted as the density of the logarithm of the transmission amplitude @xmath30 , @xmath31 the connection between the lyapunov exponent and the transmission coefficient @xmath32 was recognized long ago @xcite , though a rigorous analysis was still absent .",
    "it is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the function @xmath33 can be analytically continued in the complex half - plane @xmath34 as a nevanlinna function ( i.e. an analytic function which maps the upper complex half plane into itself ) .",
    "we will recover this property of @xmath35 directly from the analytic properties of the transmission amplitudes @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , as a direct consequence of these properties we give a new proof of the thouless formula @xmath37 where @xmath38^{1/2}$ ] is the lyapunov exponent for @xmath11 .    also we prove a new representation for the lyapunov exponent for positive energies , @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 are elements of the s - matrix at energy @xmath44 for the pair of hamiltonians ( @xmath45 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "this representation allows us to apply the theory of random matrices to prove that @xmath46 for a.e .",
    "@xmath16 almost surely , which in turn by ishii - pastur - kotani theorem implies that the spectrum of @xmath47 has no absolute continuous component in @xmath48 .",
    "we give also an explicit description of the set of special energies where @xmath49 . to our best knowledge",
    "this set was known explicitly only for the two particular cases when the single - site potential @xmath7 is a @xmath50-potential or the characteristic function of the interval @xmath51 $ ] ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we express the density of states @xmath25 for positive energies in terms of the product of matrices ( [ l.tilde ] ) , @xmath52 with @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 being the inner product in @xmath56 .",
    "this representation is similar to the definition of the density of states through the rotation number of the fundamental solution of the schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "formulae ( [ xi ] ) , ( [ 1.3 ] ) , ( [ xxx ] ) , and ( [ 1.6 ] ) also provide very simple and efficient numerical algorithms to compute the density of states and the lyapunov exponent of disordered systems in one dimension . in this context",
    "we also remark that the representations ( [ xi ] ) and ( [ 1.6 ] ) for finite @xmath57 and @xmath16 give smooth approximations to the spectral shift density and density of states , respectively .",
    "this contrasts with the usual procedure ( see e.g. @xcite ) , where the density of states is approximated by step - like functions .",
    "as an example in section 4 we have calculated the spectral shift density for the deterministic kronig - penney model .",
    "our approach is also applicable to deterministic hamiltonians of the form @xmath58 with a potential @xmath59 , which is supposed to be uniformly in @xmath60 and for technical reasons also bounded , but without any assumption on its decay at infinity .",
    "let @xmath61 be a sequence of real numbers such that @xmath62 as @xmath63 and @xmath64 for all @xmath65 .",
    "in this case we approximate @xmath47 through @xmath66 with @xmath67 being the characteristic function of the interval @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "again we show that the relations analogous to ( [ xi ] ) , ( [ 1.3 ] ) , ( [ xxx ] ) , ( [ 1.6 ] ) hold .",

    "<S> methods from scattering theory are introduced to analyze random schrdinger operators in one dimension by applying a volume cutoff to the potential . </S>",
    "<S> the key ingredient is the lifshitz - krein spectral shift function , which is related to the scattering phase by the theorem of birman and krein . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral shift density is defined as the  thermodynamic limit \" of the spectral shift function per unit length of the interaction region . </S>",
    "<S> this density is shown to be equal to the difference of the densities of states for the free and the interacting hamiltonians . based on this construction </S>",
    "<S> , we give a new proof of the thouless formula . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a prescription how to obtain the lyapunov exponent from the scattering matrix , which suggest a way how to extend this notion to the higher dimensional case . </S>",
    "<S> this prescription also allows a characterization of those energies which have vanishing lyapunov exponent . </S>"
