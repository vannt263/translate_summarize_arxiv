    "the simplest scenario we can think of is a thermal activation of states in the valence band of a small - gap semiconductor ( see for instance ref .",
    "the rise of @xmath35 at high temperatures then results from the increasing contribution of the pauli susceptibility of the conduction electrons .",

    "starting from its low frequency side , the nqr spectrum of lacuo@xmath1 at @xmath59  k ( fig .  [ spectra ] ) first shows that there are three different @xmath19la sites from the electric field gradient point of view .",
    "the relative intensities of these la1 , la2 and la3 sites represent approximately 27 , 13 and 60  % of the total la intensity . in principle , there are six different crystallographic sites for la@xmath11 ions in this material.@xcite nevertheless , these six sites can be grouped into three categories , according to the number ( six , seven or eight ) of oxygen anions to which each la@xmath11 is coordinated.@xcite the relative population of these three types of coordination can not be accurately determined because of uncertainties regarding the complex stacking sequence of copper - oxygen planes and the occurrence of numerous stacking faults.@xcite still , assuming an equal probability for the three possible stacking sequences ( named a , b and c in ref .",

    "this signal is thus a zero - field nmr signal rather than a nqr signal since the dominant source of splitting of the nuclear levels is the zeeman interaction rather than the quadrupolar one .",
    "the presence of frozen moments on some of the cu sites of the sample agrees with a muon spin rotation ( @xmath16sr ) study performed on the same sample,@xcite which indicates that afm order is present below 40 - 50  k in @xmath1720% of the sample volume .",

    "[ esr ] shows , the temperature dependence of both the field and the width of the resonance shows a first crossover near 150 - 180  k followed by a sharper change near 30 - 40 k ( for each of these two temperature ranges , the lower @xmath4 value is that indicated by the resonance field data , while the larger one is given by the width data ) .",
    "the higher temperature crossover should be related to the change observed in nqr frequency in the same temperature range .",
    "the additional shift / broadening of the resonance field below 30 - 40  k is clearly due to the magnetic freezing found to onset around 40 - 50  k in @xmath16sr.@xcite these preliminary esr results demonstrate that the esr signal is from intrinsic paramagnetic spins in lacuo@xmath1 .    .",

    "the experimental evidence for localization of the doped holes at low temperature signifies that lacuo@xmath1 should be described as a 1/3-diluted kagome lattice .",
    "we thus performed a number of numerical simulations in order to provide a concrete picture of the system at such a high dilution level @xmath82 , which turns out to almost correspond to the site percolation threshold @xmath83=0.6527 of the kagome lattice  @xcite ( _ i.e. _ @xmath84 ) .",

    "there is a homogeneous distribution of sizes up to typically 100 sites ( see inset of fig .",
    "as the percolation threshold @xmath86 is crossed , the intermediate - size clusters appear to coalesce into large clusters and the distribution becomes essentially bimodal with a minority of sites in small clusters and a large majority of sites embedded in extended clusters , some of which are percolating .",

    "[ percol ] . at this concentration and for @xmath88",

    ", there are spins for which the local environment remains identical to the pristine kagome lattice .",
    "on the other hand , there are spins in a weakly frustrated environment , including chain - like fragments .",
    "we hypothesize here that the weakly frustrated spins will have a tendency towards afm - like ordering whereas the more frustrated sites will still form spin liquid - like arrangements ( which may be of various kinds : valence bond crystals , dimer liquid , valence bond glass , etc . ) and thus remain mostly non - magnetic with a susceptibility relatively close to that of the pure kagome lattice .",
    "furthermore , a similar description has already been proposed to explain the existence of two different sites in the mssbauer spectra of lufemgo@xmath89 , a triangular lattice of fe@xmath11 spins with a site dilution level of 50 % coinciding with the percolation threshold of this lattice.@xcite the magnetic freezing of this compound ( around 33  k , that is well below the curie - weiss temperature of -500  k ) has thus been ascribed to the freezing of the weakly frustrated spins . although the ground state of the triangular lattice ( long - range ordered with spins oriented at 120@xmath90 from each other ) is different from that of the kagome lattice ( non - magnetic with short - ranged spin correlations ) , there are obvious analogies with the situation in lacuo@xmath1 .",
    "of course , this description is a caricature of the actual situation since there exist many different morphologies with all possible intermediate levels of frustration in between these two limits .",
    "nonetheless , this simple description helps to understand qualitatively the inhomogeneous magnetism in lacuo@xmath1 and a more sophisticated model is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "note also , as the next section will emphasize , that the local environment and the symmetry of sites belonging to large clusters is irrelevant from the point of view of the susceptibility .",
    "to first approximation , the curie - weiss susceptibility arises from isolated @xmath58 sites and from orphan spins  @xcite within clusters with an odd number of sites .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that the largest clusters ( _ i.e. _ those with the most pronounced kagome character ) have a negligible contribution to the susceptibility in the temperature range of interest here as their curie - like tail becomes non - negligible only at very low @xmath4 .",
    "a practical cutoff value of 13 was chosen for the size of the clusters considered in the calculation of the susceptibility .",
    "each of these clusters of @xmath91 sites ( @xmath92 ) was approximated to be a chain of @xmath91 sites , whose magnetic linear susceptibility was then calculated from exact diagonalization .",

    "k , there is also a crossover in the position and the width of the absorbtion line in electron spin resonance .",
    "we have seen that , for a dilution level as large as 33  % , the identity of the original kagome lattice is seriously degraded and , despite remaining patches of local kagome character , the system becomes mostly an inhomogeneous pattern of magnetic clusters .",
    "therefore , the peculiar properties found for weak dilution in @xmath58 kagome systems ( each impurity binds strong spin singlets in its vicinity  @xcite ) are unlikely to be relevant for lacuo@xmath1 . instead",
    ", the properties of each spin next to a cu@xmath11 will primarily be determined by the morphology of the part of the cluster it belongs to .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that all memory of the kagome physics is lost .",
    "for example , in the @xmath97 kagome - bilayer compound scgo , remarkable properties associated with the spin liquid state ( such as the original magnetic excitations responsible for a @xmath57 contribution to the specific heat or the peculiar dynamics probed by muon spectroscopy  @xcite ) are still observed at a dilution level as high as 60 % , _ i.e. _ above the percolation threshold @xmath83=0.5.@xcite",
    "first , it must be realized that the partial magnetic freezing does not arise from parasitic phases or from strong inhomogeneity of the sample : the former is ruled out by ( x - ray and neutron ) diffraction data  @xcite and the latter is inconsistent with the observation of well - defined nqr lines and of a well - defined structure ( recall that oxygen dopants are not randomly located , they are well - ordered in cu planes where they build the kagome lattice itself ) . also , the well - defined oscillation seen in @xmath16sr for both lacuo@xmath1 and ycuo@xmath1 ( with an even larger magnetic fraction for the latter ) speak in favor of an intrinsic magnetism from macroscopic - size clusters.@xcite thus , the frozen magnetic fraction is an intrinsic property of lacuo@xmath1 .",
    "even if the two - dimensional , frustrated and quantum nature of the kagome lattice of spins 1/2 is unfavorable to long range ordering  @xcite , the occurrence of magnetic freezing in lacuo@xmath1 is not really a big surprise : inhomogeneous magnetism with partial fractions of frozen spins is already found in relatively pure compounds approaching the perfect kagome geometry.@xcite part of the explanation probably lies in the presence of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , which is known to drive the kagome antiferromagnet towards magnetic ordering,@xcite even for the quantum spins @xmath58.@xcite    dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction is also expected for the non centrosymmetric cu - o - cu bonds in lacuo@xmath1 but since its magnitude is not known , it is difficult to assess its role in the spin freezing here . in any event , we expect that the destructuralization of the kagome lattice at 1/3-dilution should still play a dominant role .",
    "the hypothesis that magnetic order is nucleated at those sites for which the local environment is mostly non - frustrated ( chain - like for instance ) readily justifies the partial character of the frozen phase .",
    "this scenario of locally released frustration also provides a natural boost of the onset temperature of magnetic freezing which is needed to explain values as high as 40 - 50  k in lacuo@xmath1 , that is equivalent to at least @xmath43/10 ( see discussion on @xmath43 in section  iii.b ) .    in any case , it is likely that magnetic order in these frustrated compounds arises from the conjunction of different factors and not from a single one .",
    "for example , the probable inter - triangle exchange interactions in ycuo@xmath1 represent a deviation from the simple nearest - neighbor kagome model which lowers the degree of frustration and thus favors spin ordering .",
    "this presumably explains why the magnetic volume fraction in ycuo@xmath1 is as high as 80  % , @xcite much higher than 20  % in lacuo@xmath1 , for the same dilution level .",
    "however , orbital - ordering and/or jahn - teller effects might have to be considered as well .",
    "the properties of lacuo@xmath1 appear different from those of lacuo@xmath27 .",
    "lacuo@xmath1 seems to have an insulating ground state with magnetic order on part of the sites , while lacuo@xmath27 apparently has features ( such as a @xmath4-linear term in @xmath55 and a single nqr site with short relaxation time @xmath23 ) which suggest a metallic ground state without any magnetic order .",
    "@xcite because the perfect kagome lattice is realized only for @xmath15 , the small difference in the nominal planar - o content of the two compounds implies a difference in their electronic structure which can be much more effective than the difference in hole - doping in producing different ground states .",
    "furthermore , given the lack of a well - defined planar structure for @xmath13 , there is a much larger uncertainty on the oxygen content for this compound .",
    "therefore , the two compounds may be significantly more different than what their similar formulas suggest .",
    "nevertheless , the striking difference in physical behaviors is unlikely to be simply explained in terms of structural differences . indeed , the larger disorder in lacuo@xmath27 should make the sample more insulating , while it is observed to be more metallic than lacuo@xmath1 .",
    "a possible solution to this paradox is that the commensurate value of the oxygen concentration @xmath9 locks the otherwise metallic system into an insulator .",
    "a scenario of charge ordering at @xmath9 is appealing for rationalizing a commensurability lock - in and for partially relieving frustration.@xcite it might also be compatible with the crossover detected near 150 - 180  k in the nqr and esr measurements ( fig.[cu1nqr]a ) .",
    "however , we only mention this scenario here as a possibility : in the absence of any direct evidence , charge order remains a speculation here and crossovers could as well be produced by hole localization at random locations .",
    "we have found that lacuo@xmath1 has an insulating ground state which makes it a realization of the 1/3 depleted kagome lattice . we have found inhomogenous magnetism which numerical simulations suggest to arise from the heterogeneous distribution of cluster sizes and morphologies near the site - percolation threshold .",
    "of course , a lot remains to be done to understand these complex delafossite compounds .",
    "although apparently not displaying the metallic properties of sodium cobaltates na@xmath98coo@xmath8 ( a doped triangular lattice ) , this class of copper oxides appears as an uncharted playground for studying the doping of a frustrated lattice and would be worth deeper theoretical and experimental investigations .",
