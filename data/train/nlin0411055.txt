    "except for a few prominent counterexamples  @xcite , the low energy physics of practically all chaotic quantum systems is governed by the universal spectral correlations of wigner and dyson s random matrix ( rm ) ensembles  @xcite . yet in spite of its ubiquity , and notwithstanding a number of significant recent advances  @xcite , the correspondence above is not yet fully understood theoretically . specifically ,",
    "the ` non  perturbative ' aspects of the problem  which manifest themselves , e.g. , in the low energy profile of spectral correlations  are not under quantitative control .",
    "some time ago , the introduction of a field theoretical approach , similar in spirit to the @xmath0models of disordered fermion systems , added a new perspective to the problem  @xcite .",
    "called ` ballistic @xmath0model ' describes chaotic systems in terms of a field theory in classical phase space .",
    "remarkably , it provides a faithful description of rm spectral correlations already on the most elementary mean field level where fluctuations inhomogeneous in phase space are neglected ; ` all ' that remains to prove universality is to show that these inhomogeneities indeed become inessential in the long time limit  an expectation backed up by the long time ergodicity of chaotic systems .",
    "unfortunately , however , this latter task soon proved to be excruciatingly difficult . in this paper",
    "we shall concentrate on the perhaps most serious of these problems , the seeming incapability of the new approach to correctly describe even the lowest order quantum interference corrections ( ` weak localization corrections ' in the jargon of mesoscopic physics ) to physical observables : in a semiclassical manner of speaking , ` quantum interference ' is a process wherein two initially identical  modulo the notorious uncertainty introduced by the non  vanishing of planck s constant  feynman trajectories split up and later recombine to an overall phase coherent structure ( see figure [ sr_pair ] ) .",
    "this mechanism is at the root of practically all quantum phenomena distinguishing disordered or chaotic quantum systems from their classical limits .",
    "it is closely tied to the notion of the ehrenfest time  the time it takes for the separation of two trajectories to grow from planck scales to macroscopic scales .",
    "irritatingly , however , the field theory formalism appeared to be incapable of describing the initial @xmath1uncertainty triggering these phenomena . deferring for a more detailed discussion to section  [ sec : field - theor - form ] below ,",
    "let us try to outline the essence of the problem : loosely speaking , the field degrees of freedom of the ballistic @xmath0model describe the joint propagation of retarded and advanced feynman amplitudes along classical trajectories in phase space .",
    "previous works effectively did not allow for deviations between the two amplitudes . at this level of approximation ,",
    "the retarded and the advanced reference path are strictly identical and the @xmath1quantum uncertainty essential to initiate the formation of quantum interference corrections is absent . equally important",
    ", points in phase space belonging to _ different _ classical trajectories remain uncorrelated .",
    "this implies that the theory will not be able to describe the relaxation into the uniform mean field configuration ( i.e.  will not be able to predict rmt behaviour . )    a phenomenological solution to this problem was proposed by aleiner and larkin  @xcite .",
    "building on the insight gained in previous work , they added a diffusive contribution ( formally , a second order elliptic operator ) to the action of the model .",
    "multiplied by a coupling constant of @xmath2 , this term introduced a sufficient amount of ` fuzziness ' to the problem to initiate quantum interference processes . although the extra contribution to the action could not be derived from first principles",
    ", al argued that it ought to be present on physical grounds ( viz .  to mimic the diffractive aspects of the propagation of quantum states . )",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate that , in fact , no diffraction terms are needed to describe quantum interference within the framework of the ballistic @xmath0model .",
    "our analysis will hinge on an aspect of the theory that has been noticed before  @xcite yet did not receive sufficient attention : the @xmath0model is not a _ local _ field theory in phase space ; by construction , and in accord with the principles of the uncertainty relation its maximal resolution is limited to planck cells of extension @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we will show that this non  locality suffices to describe quantum interference in far  reaching analogy with recent semiclassical approaches  @xcite to the problem . in recent work  @xcite",
    ", similar ideas have been applied to compute ( in a non  field theoretical setting ) weak localization corrections of a quantum map ( viz .",
    "the standard map or kicked rotor ) .",
    "specifically , we will consider the spectral two  point correlation function @xmath5 at energies @xmath6 larger than the single particle spacing @xmath7 .",
    "we will show that the expansion of @xmath8 in the small parameter @xmath9 agrees with the prediction of rmt .",
    "( in a manner that largely parallels our present analysis , the same result has recently been obtained by periodic orbit theory  @xcite . ) the extensibility of the analysis to the perturbatively inaccessible regime @xmath10 remains an open issue .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : to facilitate the comparison with the field theoretical formalism , we begin by reviewing some of the recent developments in the semiclassical approach to quantum chaos ( section  [ sec : semicl - backgr ] ) . in section  [ sec : field - theor - form ]",
    "we turn to the field theoretical approach and apply it to the perturbative expansion of the two  point correlation function .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we are interested in the behaviour of globally hyperbolic ( chaotic ) quantum systems at time scales @xmath11 larger than the ergodic time @xmath12 yet smaller than the heisenberg time @xmath13 .",
    "( the first condition implies that non  universal aspects of the classical dynamics are inessential , the second that concepts of perturbation theory ( in the parameter @xmath14 ) are applicable . )    to describe correlations in the spectrum of the system , we consider the two  point correlation function @xmath15 and its fourier transform @xmath16 the spectral form factor . here",

    "let us briefly summarize the main results recently obtained for the semiclassical form factor : for times @xmath27 , @xmath28 can be expanded in a series in @xmath29 . as shown by berry  @xcite , the dominant contribution to this expansion @xmath30 ,",
    "is provided by pairs of identical @xmath31 or mutually time reversed ( @xmath32 ) paths .",
    "( throughout we focus on the case of time reversal and spin rotation invariant systems  orthogonal symmetry . )",
    "all corrections to the leading contribution @xmath33 hinge on the mechanism of quantum interference alluded to in the introduction .",
    "e.g. , the sub  dominant contribution , @xmath34 , to the form factor is provided by pairs @xmath35 that are nearly identical except for one ` encounter region ' : generally contains many self intersections in _ configuration space_. ] in this region one of the path self  intersects while its partner just so avoids the intersection ( cf .",
    "figure [ sr_pair ] ) .",
    "( alternatively , one may think of two trajectories that start out nearly identical , then split up and later recombine to form an interfering feynman amplitude pair . )",
    "the two paths are , thus , topologically distinct yet may carry almost identical classical action  @xcite . specifically , sieber and richter  @xcite have shown that for sufficiently shallow self intersections ( crossing angle in configuration space of @xmath36 ) the action difference @xmath37 . for these angles ,",
    "the duration of the encounter process is of the order of the ehrenfest time @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the phase space average of the dominant lyapunov exponent of the system and @xmath40 a classical reference scale ( see below ) whose detailed value is of secondary importance .",
    "this identifies @xmath41 as the minimal time required to form quantum corrections to the form factor ( as well as to other physical observables  @xcite ) . throughout",
    "we shall assume @xmath42 , where the condition @xmath43 is imposed to guarantee that for time scales @xmath44 , the system indeed behaves universally .",
    "( for @xmath45 , the time window @xmath46 is characterized by the prevalence of correlations that are non ",
    "universal yet quantum mechanical in nature . )",
    "summation over all sieber ",
    "richter pairs  @xcite leads to the universal result @xmath47 , which is consistent with the short time expansion of the random matrix form factor @xmath48 at higher orders in the @xmath29expansion , orbit pairs of more complex topology enter the stage .",
    "( for some families of pairs contributing to the next leading correction , @xmath49 , see figure [ tau_3_terms ] . )",
    "the summation over all these pairs  @xcite  feasible under the presumed condition @xmath50  obtains an infinite @xmath29series which equals the series expansion of the rmt result ( [ krm ] ) . at @xmath51  @xcite , the form factor at times",

    "it is also noteworthy that both the topology of the contributing orbit pairs and the combinatorial aspects of the summation are in one  to ",
    "one correspondence to the impurity  diagram expansion  @xcite of the spectral correlation function of disordered quantum systems .",
    "central to our comparison of semiclassics and field theory below will be the understanding of the encounter regions where formerly pairwise aligned orbit stretches reorganize .",
    "the analysis of these objects is greatly facilitated by switching from the configuration space representation originally used in  @xcite to one in phase space  @xcite . in the following",
    "we briefly discuss the phase space structure of the regions where periodic orbits meet . in section",
    "[ sec : pert - expans ] we will compare these structures to the  somewhat different  field theoretical variant of encounter processes .    considering the correction @xmath34 as an example , we note that the encounter region contains four orbit stretches in close proximity to each other ( cf .  figures [ sr_pair ] , [ tr_encounter ] ) : two segments @xmath53 and @xmath54 of the orbits @xmath22 and @xmath23 traversing the encounter region and the _ _ time reversed _ _",

    "this implies that each vertex @xmath165 contributes a factor @xmath221 to the functional integral .",
    "specifically , the dominant correction ( @xmath222 ) to the leading contribution  ( [ r2s2 ] ) obtains by first order expansion in the vertex @xmath223 : @xmath224 we emphasize again that all products of @xmath162matrices have to be understood as moyal products . to obtain a convenient representation of the product of more than two of these matrices ,",
    "we iteratively apply the prototype formula equation ( [ moyal_nonloc ] ) .",

    "further , fluctuations in the time  like variables @xmath232 are negligible . introducing the shorthand notation @xmath233 , we thus have @xmath234 using this representation in ( [ r2_3 ] ) , applying the contraction rules ( [ contraction ] ) discussed in  [ sec : perturbation_theory ] , and taking the replica limit we obtain @xmath235 where the coordinate subscript in @xmath236 indicates the argument on which the liouvillian acts .",
    "the physical meaning of this expression is best revealed by switching to the fourier conjugate picture . inserting the definition  ( [ formfactor ] ) of the form factor",

    "equation ( [ k_2_tau ] ) makes the analogies ( as well as a number of differences ) between the semiclassical and the field theoretical description of quantum corrections explicit : central to both approaches are two semi  loops shown schematically in figure [ sr_pair ] . in either case , the proximity of these loops is controlled by phase factors which contain the coordinates of the end points ( in a canonically invariant manner ) as their arguments .",
    "however , unlike with semiclassics , equation ( [ k_2_tau ] ) does not relate the unification of the two semi  loops to specific periodic orbits .",
    "rather , the two halves are treated as independent entities , each described in terms of its own probability factor @xmath210 .",
    "relatedly , the phase factor controlling the proximity of the terminal points does not correspond to the action difference between two orbits .",
    "the result obtained for @xmath239 in equation ( [ k_2_tau ] ) critically depends on the behaviour of the propagator @xmath240 at times @xmath241 , cf .",
    "equations ( [ tehrenfest ] ,  [ transition ] ) .",

    "we also note that the poisson bracket @xmath246 effectively differentiates along the trajectory through @xmath71",
    ". however , the time @xmath247 defined in equation ( [ tehrenfest ] ) depends only on the coordinates transverse to the trajectory .",
    "this implies @xmath248 .",
    "we thus conclude that the action of @xmath249 on the function @xmath210 is given by @xmath250 . to understand the meaning of the second approximation , notice that it takes a time @xmath251 before the bulk of the planck cell to which the points @xmath71 and @xmath67 belong has grown to classical scales @xmath40 .",

    "counting , this diagram contributes to the correlation function at order @xmath268 . for every value of @xmath269",
    ", it contains @xmath270 encounter regions where @xmath156 orbit segments meet and @xmath271 inter - encounter orbit stretches .",
    "the topology of the diagram is fixed by the way in which the @xmath162 matrices are contracted .",
    "( for example , the first of the diagrams shown in figure [ tau_3_terms ] corresponds to the contraction @xmath272 of @xmath273 , the second diagram to the contraction @xmath274 of @xmath275 , etc . )",
    "importantly , the minimum time required for the buildup of a diagram ( i.e. , the time required to traverse the @xmath276 encounter regions ) is given by @xmath277 .",
    "turning back to the full problem , let us consider the analog of the zero dimensional expression ( [ diagramzero ] ) , @xmath278)^{m_2}\\,(s^{(6)}[b])^{m_3}\\dots \\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath165 is given by ( [ s2n ] ) and the average is over the full quadratic action  ( [ actioncl ] ) .",
    "it is natural to expect that the unique correspondence between wick contractions and semiclassical diagrams carries over to the full model .",
    "if so , individual contractions should vanish / reduce to the universal rmt result for times shorter / much larger than @xmath279 . in section  [ sec : pert - expans ] this correspondence was exemplified for the simplest non  trivial example , the sieber  richter diagram @xmath280\\rangle$ ] .",
    "perhaps unexpectedly , the straightforward one  to  one correspondence outlined above does not pertain to higher orders in perturbation theory . to anticipate our main findings",
    ", it turns out that at order @xmath281 in the series expansion , propagators of short duration @xmath282  absent in the @xmath283 term considered above  begin to play a role .",
    "this implies that individual contractions may relate to more than one semiclassical diagram class .",
    "nonetheless , integration over all time parameters obtains a universal result .    by way of example , let us consider the @xmath272 contraction of @xmath284 . for generic values ( @xmath285 ) of the time arguments carried by the four resulting propagators the contraction corresponds to the orbit pair shown in figure [ tau_3_terms ] left .",
    "however , the integration over times @xmath286 also extends over exceptional values where one of the two propagators connecting the two encounter regions ( @xmath287 or @xmath288 ) is of short duration @xmath289 . such a short time propagator connects two _",
    "distinct _ vertices . returning after a short time to its point of departure ( @xmath290 ) .",
    "since @xmath11 is much shorter than the ehrenfest time , all other propagators departing from the concerned hikami box will essentially follow the trajectory traced out by the return propagator , and , after a time @xmath11 , also return to the departure region .",
    "in semiclassical language , we are dealing with an orbit that traverses a loop structure in phase space repeatedly .",
    "it is known , however , that for large time scales , the probability to find repetitive orbits is exponentially small ( in the parameter @xmath291 ) , i.e.  short self  retracing contractions are negligible . ]",
    "this results in a structure as shown in figure [ s8s6_ambiguity ] right , where the two clusters of dots indicate the eight phase space arguments of the @xmath162fields , the straight line ",
    "pair represents the short propagator , and the box indicates that all phase space points lie in a _ single",
    "_ encounter region . evidently , this structure corresponds to a pair of orbits visiting a single encounter region twice .",
    "diagrams of this structure are canonically obtained by contraction of a ` hikami hexagon ' @xmath292 , as indicated in figure [ s8s6_ambiguity ] left .",
    "fortunately , the absence of a unique assignment to semiclassical orbit families , does not significantly complicate the actual computation of the diagrams : closer inspection shows that taking the liouville operators involved in the definition of the hikami boxes into account and integrating by parts , we again obtain the universal zero  mode result .    summarizing",
    ", we have seen that at next to leading order in perturbation theory short time propagators begin to play a role .",
    "while this complication prevents the assignment of wick contractions to orbit pairs of definite topology , the results obtained after integration over all temporal configurations remain universal ( agree with the rmt prediction ) .",
    "we trust that the structures discussed above are exemplary for the behaviour of the ballistic @xmath0model at arbitrary orders of perturbation theory , i.e.  that after integration over all intermediate times , each contraction contributing to ( [ diagramfull ] ) produces the universal result otherwise obtained by its zero dimensional analog equation ( [ diagramzero ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we have applied field theoretical methods to explore quantum interference corrections to the spectral form factor of individual chaotic systems .",
    "we have seen that the formation of the latter essentially relies on the fact that the ballistic @xmath0model  a field theory defined in classical phase space  is not capable of resolving structures on scales smaller than the planck cell .",
    "this quantum uncertainty is an intrinsic feature of the model ( viz .",
    "through the fact that the field degrees of freedom are multiplied by moyal rather than by conventional products ) and need not be added by hand as was done in previous approaches . in a manner that largely parallels the results of recent semiclassical analyses , the interplay of this uncertainty with the instabilities of the underlying classical chaotic dynamics leads to the formation of universal quantum interference corrections to the spectral form factor .    the analysis above is perturbative in nature and , thus , limited to energy scales larger than the single particle level spacing . to advance into the perturbatively inaccessible regime @xmath293 ( i.e.  to prove the universality hypothesis in full ) one would need to understand how the conspiracy of quantum uncertainty and classical instabilities damps out fluctuations inhomogeneous in phase space at time scales larger than the ehrenfest time .",
    "the identification of a concrete mechanism effecting this reduction remains an open issue .",
    "countless discussions with f.  haake on all issues relating to the semiclassical understanding of the problem are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "we have also benefited from discussions with o.  agam .",
    "work supported by sfb / tr12 of the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft and gif grant 709 .",
    "throughout this appendix we use phase space coordinates @xmath228 , where @xmath229 is the energy , @xmath11",
    "a time  like coordinate conjugate to energy and parameterizing the hamiltonian flow through @xmath71 , and @xmath230 a @xmath231component vector of energy shell coordinates transverse to @xmath11 .",
    "as discussed in the text , the quadratic action of the model is controlled by the commutator @xmath131 $ ] or , upon wigner transformation , the series of operators @xmath131\\mapsto\\rmi\\hbar\\{h,\\;\\}+ \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\hbar^{2n+1 } d^{(2n+1)}(\\partial_{{\\bf x}})$ ] , where @xmath294 is an operator of @xmath295th order in the phase space derivatives @xmath296 .",
    "when acting in a space of functions smooth on scales @xmath1 , terms beyond the leading term ( the poisson bracket ) are inessential and the quantum dynamics collapses to its semiclassical limit .",
    "navely , one might hope that to achieve this reduction it suffices to choose the _ initial _ distributions in phase space sufficiently smooth .",
    "however , what complicates the problem is that the generator of classical evolution @xmath174 by itself leads to the dynamical buildup of singularities , no matter how smooth the initial distribution was .",
    "the point is that , due to the global hyperbolicity of the dynamics , we may locally identify truly expanding and contracting coordinate directions .",
    "focusing attention on the latter , and linearizing the flow around a given reference trajectory , the equations of motion controlling the evolution of a phase space distribution @xmath297 assume the form @xmath298 , where @xmath83 is the coordinate that contracts strongest , @xmath39 the corresponding lyapunov exponent , and the ellipses indicate derivatives in other coordinate directions .",
    "after a time @xmath299 , where @xmath300 denotes the characteristic initial extension of the distribution , structures in the @xmath83direction fluctuating on scales @xmath301 will have formed implying that derivatives @xmath302 acting in @xmath83direction can no longer be neglected .",
    "one way to remove this complication  @xcite is to add to the generator of classical time evolution an elliptic operator @xmath303 , where @xmath304 is constant .",
    "indeed , it is straightforward to show ( by dimensional analysis or by explicit calculation ) that for the regularized operator @xmath305 the initial contraction halts at a characteristic scale @xmath306 . choosing @xmath307 , it is guaranteed that the distribution will not build up structure on scales @xmath308 , i.e.  that the quantum corrections to classical dynamics are negligible .",
    "this motivates the addition of the regulatory contribution ( [ actionreg ] ) to the action .      in the main text ( cf . ,",
    "e.g. , equation ( [ moyal2nb ] ) ) , we have assumed that ( a ) all fields are defined on a shell of constant energy @xmath19 and ( b ) the theory is local in the conjugate ` time ' coordinate @xmath11 . to understand the meaning of this reduction",

    "for completeness , we briefly summarize the contraction rules  @xcite employed in calculating integrals over products of @xmath162 matrices : @xmath334 where @xmath335 and @xmath336 are arbitrary fixed matrices . to compute the integral over an arbitrary product of traces of @xmath162matrices , one first forms all possible total pairings @xmath162@xmath337 , @xmath162@xmath162 , and @xmath337@xmath337 , and then computes individual pairings by means of ( [ contraction ] ) .",
