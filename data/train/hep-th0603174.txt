    "although the time - dependent magnetic @xmath3 field existing in the early universe develops an anisotropy in the universe , it was realized that the matter - like behavior of the @xmath3 field ( b - matter ) ensures a dilution of the anisotropy at late times and thus the isotropy is recovered in reasonable cosmological scenarios @xcite . in such sense",

    "section  [ sec:3 ] is devoted to presenting homogeneous solutions in flat spacetime illustrating some interesting features of the b - matter  dilaton system in a simple way . in section  [ sec:4 ] , we find semi - analytic and numerical cosmological solutions to observe an intriguing interplay of the curvature @xmath4 and the d - brane tension @xmath5 . in section  [ sec:5 ]",
    ", we consider the evolution of the anisotropic universe with the dilaton stabilization which leads to a satisfactory cosmology of the d - brane universe .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the main idea of the d - brane world is that we reside on a d@xmath6-brane imbedded in 10 ( or 11 ) dimensional spacetime with extra - dimensions compactified .",

    ", the gauge invariance of @xmath2 is restored through its coupling to a u(1 ) gauge field @xmath7 and the gauge invariant field strength is @xcite @xmath8    even though we are assumed to live on the d - brane , we adopt the conventional compactification in the sense that the extra dimensions are compact and stabilized , and thus static . in the presence of the d - brane ,",
    "this would in general require an additional setup like additional branes and fluxes along the extra dimensions  @xcite , and the working of non - perturbative effects  @xcite .",
    "the extra dimensions are warped due to branes and fluxes .",
    "the warping of extra dimensions gives a warp factor in the definition of the four - dimensional planck scale  @xcite , and also induces the potential for the dilaton  @xcite as described below .",
    "if the fluxes in the extra dimensions significantly affect the compactification , the existence of the fluxes on the d - brane seems also natural and it is intriguing to tackle their effect in the early universe",
    ". however , simultaneous consideration of the fluxes along both the extra dimensions and the d - brane lets the computation almost intractable .",
    "therefore , the conventional compactification is an appropriate setup at the present stage , and then we take the following four - dimensional effective action of the bosonic sector in the string frame  @xcite @xmath9,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the tilde denotes the string frame quantity , @xmath10}$ ] and @xmath11 with @xmath12 . the parameter @xmath5 is defined by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the effective brane tension .",

    "the qualitative features of our results do not depend on specific values of @xmath6 .",
    "thus , we take @xmath19 for simplicity .",

    "cosmological implication of the d - brane universe is of our main interest , including stabilization of the dilaton and condensation of the antisymmetric tensor field .",
    "for the sake of the simplicity , let us first look into the dynamics of our system in flat spacetime . with @xmath28 ,",
    "the einstein equations ( [ e - eq1 ] ) become simple and gauge invariance of the field variables @xmath29 and @xmath30 which directly appear in the expression of energy - momentum ( [ tb ] ) allows a homogeneous configuration @xmath31    for homogeneous configuration ( [ hom ] ) , @xmath32-components ( _ electric _ components ) of the equation of the antisymmetric tensor field ( [ b - eq1 ] ) reduce to an algebraic equation @xmath33 @xmath34-components ( _ magnetic _ components ) give @xmath35 where the overdot denotes differentiation with respect to the rescaled dimensionless time @xmath36 these equations ( [ 0i])([ij ] ) tell us that the _ magnetic _ components @xmath37 are _ dynamical _ but the _ electric _ components are determined by the _ constraint _ equation ( [ 0i ] ) .",
    "dynamics of the dilaton is governed by ( [ p - eq1 ] ) which becomes @xmath38 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath39 is defined by @xmath40    the constraint equation ( [ 0i ] ) forces its numerator to vanish except a trivial solution @xmath41 , however vanishing numerator allows only a _ vanishing",
    "_ electric field solution @xmath42 .",
    "then the equations for the magnetic components ( [ ij ] ) and the dilaton ( [ de ] ) reduce to @xmath43 in the following , we will find solutions of ( [ m1 ] ) and ( [ m2 ] ) to see how the dilaton and the magnetic component behave .",
    "when the magnetic components of the antisymmetric tensor field @xmath45 vanish , we have only the dilaton equation from ( [ m2 ] ) @xmath46 where the dilaton potential @xmath47 is given by the sum of the curvature term and the brane tension term @xmath48 as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .    .",
    "for @xmath49 , @xmath47 monotonically increases ( dashed line ) . for @xmath50 , @xmath47 has a minimum at @xmath51 ( solid line ) . ]    for @xmath49 , the dilaton potential @xmath47 monotonically increases , so the dilaton finally rolls to the minimum @xmath52 as @xmath53 . for @xmath50 ,",
    "the dilaton potential @xmath47 has the minimum value @xmath54 at @xmath55 . if @xmath56 , the dilaton is stuck at @xmath57 .",
    "when @xmath58 , the dilaton oscillates around the minimum .",
    "therefore , the dilaton is stabilized with mass @xmath59 , and due to exponential potential terms , its mass can be much different from the vacuum expectation value of the dilaton @xmath60 .",
    "as @xmath39 increases , the dilaton mass rapidly grows .",
    "when @xmath61 , the dilaton again rolls to negative infinity .",
    "it means that the dilaton is easily destabilized by its fluctuations , if the dilaton mass becomes too small .",
    "though the negative vacuum energy @xmath62 does not affect the dynamics of the dilaton and the antisymmetric tensor field in flat spacetime , its coupling to gravity leads to singular cosmological evolution as we shall see in section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "therefore , for the proper description of cosmology , some additional term is needed to adjust the value of @xmath63 to vanish as we shall discuss in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "the runaway or stabilized behavior of the dilaton remains essentially unchanged even with @xmath64 although the dependence on the initial conditions alters as we will see in the next subsection .      without loss of generality ,",
    "let us assume that the direction of the magnetic component of antisymmetric tensor field is fixed as @xmath65 .",
    "although the equations of motion ( [ m1])([m2 ] ) are still complicated even under this assumption , the presence of the magnetic components do not alter the story of the dilaton much .",
    "first , let us consider a simple case of zero brane tension ( @xmath66 ) , which is analytically tractable .",
    "then in ( [ m1])([m2 ] ) , only the @xmath39-dependent term survives on the right - hand side .",
    "( for this case , we will use the original @xmath4 and time @xmath67 since @xmath66 . ) the solutions to these equations are @xmath68 + \\ln c_1 \\,,\\ ] ] and @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 are integration constants , and the time has been rescaled to @xmath73 by absorbing another constant @xmath74 .",
    "the solutions are still remaining valid under @xmath75 , i.e. , under the change of the sign of @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , we can fix the time @xmath76 to flow to the positive direction and @xmath77 .",
    "the solutions approach their asymptotic configurations at large @xmath76 , @xmath78 we observe that the dilaton rolls linearly in time to negative infinity , and the antisymmetric tensor field condensates to a constant @xmath79 which depends on @xmath4 .",
    "there are two topologically distinct condensation processes depending on the signature of @xmath70 which is to be set by the initial conditions ; the change in @xmath4 contributes to @xmath80 oppositely .",
    "with the brane tension term turned on , we numerically study due to the complexity of field equations .",
    "the solutions are classified into two classes as in the pure dilaton case in section  [ subsec:3.a ] , depending on the signature of @xmath39 .    for @xmath49 ,",
    "the dilaton approaches negative infinity irrespective of initial conditions , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the condensed value of the magnetic component deviates from the initial value in the beginning , and then stabilizes to a constant as shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "we observed from the numerical results that there exist two branches of the magnetic condensation depending on the initial conditions as discussed above , but we show only one branch in the figure . like in the @xmath66 case , once the magnetic component is condensed , the condensation survives as a constant value .",
    "it is different from the case without the dilaton , in which the magnetic component permanently oscillates in flat spacetime  @xcite .     and @xmath3 in the einstein frame for @xmath83 ( solid lines ) , @xmath84 ( dashed lines ) , and @xmath85 ( dotted lines )",
    ". the initial conditions are @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "the configurations are almost the same as those for nonnegative @xmath39 ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "for small enough @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the dilaton shows the oscillating behavior as expected from the dilaton potential in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "according to the dilaton oscillation , the magnetic component is also oscillating around a condensed value ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "if we involve the radiation of perturbative modes of the dilaton and the antisymmetric tensor field , which is missing in this classical configuration , the classical solution will damp to a stabilized value of the dilaton and the final condensed value of the magnetic component .",
    "in this section we study cosmological solutions of the d - brane universe in the presence of both the dilaton and the antisymmetric tensor field . as we have done in the previous paper @xcite",
    ", we assume spatially homogeneous configurations for the antisymmetric tensor field and the dilaton , and look for the time evolution of these fields and the expansion of the universe .    the non - vanishing homogeneous antisymmetric tensor field , in general , implies the anisotropic universe . to consider the simplest form of anisotropic cosmology ,",

    "we look for the solutions to the above field equations for various cases beginning with some simple solutions .",
    "the dilaton in the system of equations ( [ eq - b])([eq - a3 ] ) has the exponential potential up to the correction due to the antisymmetric tensor field .",
    "it is well - known that the scalar field with the exponential potential possesses the scaling solution in which the energy density of the scalar field mimics the background fluid energy density @xcite .",
    "this scaling solution is also an attractor , so that the late time behavior of the solutions are universal irrespective of initial conditions .",

    "we start from an ansatz of the form @xmath118 where we suppressed constant terms in @xmath119 and @xmath120 which correspond to simple rescaling of coordinates .",
    "for the case of @xmath117 , we obtain two distinguished solutions @xmath121 and @xmath122 the first solution is nothing but the solution ( [ sol - a ] ) with @xmath123 .",
    "the second solution has the non - vanishing antisymmetric tensor field . for the case of @xmath66",

    "these solutions are the solutions to the eqs .",
    "( [ eq - b])([eq - a3 ] ) for the specific initial conditions .",
    "however , the importance of these solutions , as noted in the first paragraph , arises from the fact that they are attractors , which means that after enough time the solutions with different initial conditions approach these solutions .",
    "we will confirm this through numerical analysis in the next subsection .",
    "the solution ( [ sol-1 ] ) applies for the brane tension dominated case where the dilaton potential is approximated by @xmath130 from eq .",
    "( [ pu ] ) . the evolution of the dilaton under this potential produces matter with the equation of state @xmath131 .",

    "the measure of anisotropy is @xmath132 this result is contrasted with that in ref .",

    "the rolling of the dilaton makes the difference .",
    "it affects the dynamics of @xmath3 field in such a way that @xmath101 remains constant at @xmath133 instead of oscillating about the potential minimum @xmath134 and the anisotropy is maintained .",
    "let us turn to the third solution ( [ sol-3 ] ) .",
    "it is relevant when the dilaton potential arising from the curvature of extra dimensions , @xmath135 , dominates over other contributions . in our scheme",
    "this happens as the dilaton rolls down the potential .",
    "when @xmath101 vanishes , the transition point at which @xmath136 starts to dominate over @xmath137 is at @xmath138 .",
    "thus , this solution describes the late time behavior of all the solutions with various initial conditions when @xmath4 is positive .",
    "it is very intriguing since we achieve the isotropic universe in the end .",
    "the rolling of dilaton makes the brane tension term which causes the anisotropy when we have non - vanishing @xmath3 field less important than the extra dimension curvature term which recovers the isotropy .",
    "the rolling of the dilaton under the potential @xmath136 now forms the matter having the equation of state @xmath139 , thus giving marginal inflation .",
    "we have the second order differential equations for four variables @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 .",
    "thus we need eight initial values @xmath81 , @xmath144 , @xmath82 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 to specify the solution . among these",
    ", @xmath150 can always be set to zero by coordinate rescaling .",
    "@xmath151 must obey the constraint equation ( [ eq - constraint ] ) , but this does not fix the ratio @xmath152 . we choose the isotropic universe as a natural initial condition which leads to @xmath153 .",
    "since the dilaton potential is composed of exponential terms , the shift of the dilaton field by a constant can be traded for the redefinition of mass scale .",
    "we use this property to take the initial value of the dilaton to be zero without loss of generality . in our numerical analysis , we take the dimensionless time variable as @xmath154 where @xmath155 and use the variable @xmath156 with its initial value @xmath157 .",
    "this means that the proper time scale for the cosmological evolution is not @xmath158 , but @xmath159 . for convenience s sake , we take the initial time as @xmath160 .",
    "the other mass scale @xmath4 is also affected by this shift and we can treat it by replacing the parameter @xmath39 with @xmath161 .",
