    "the involvement of van der waals ( vdw ) forces in a variety of physicochemical processes and promising potential applications ( such as the construction of atomic - force microscopes @xcite or reflective atom - optical elements @xcite ) have created the need for a very detailed understanding and controlling them .",
    "casimir and polder @xcite were the first to study the vdw interaction within the frame of rigorous quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "investigating the interaction between an atom and a perfectly reflecting semi - infinite ( planar ) body , they found that in the short - distance ( non - retardation ) limit the interaction potential @xmath0 behaves like @xmath1 ( @xmath2 , distance between the atom and the interface ) , whereas in the long - distance ( retardation ) limit it behaves like @xmath3 . in their theory ,",
    "casimir and polder quantized the ( transverse ) vector potential of the electromagnetic field ( outside the perfectly reflecting body ) in terms of normal modes and coupled them to the atom according to the minimal - coupling hamiltonian , with its coulomb part being determined by means of the method of image charges .",
    "they then calculated the ( lowest - order ) change of the ground - state energy of the system arising from this coupling , which is a function of the atomic position and thus plays the role of the potential energy that determines the force acting on the atom .    in the earlier experiments @xcite , which studied the deflection of thermal atomic beams by conducting surfaces , the observed signal was extremely low .",
    "nevertheless , qualitative trends in agreement with the @xmath1 law were observed . only recent progress in experimental techniques",
    "has rendered it possible to detect vdw forces with sufficiently high precision @xcite .",
    "in particular , by using atomic passage between two parallel plates , the @xmath3 retarded potential could be verified @xcite .",
    "other methods for measuring vdw forces have been based on transmission grating diffraction of molecular beams @xcite , atomic quantum reflection @xcite , evanescent - wave atomic mirror techniques @xcite , and ( indirect ) measurements via spectroscopic means @xcite .",
    "proposals have been made on improvements of monitoring the vdw interaction by using atomic interferometry @xcite .",
    "since the appearance of casimir s and polder s pioneering article in 1948 there has been a large body of work on the vdw interaction ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . roughly speaking , there have been two routes to treat the problem . in the first , which closely follows the ideas of casimir and polder ,",
    "explicit field quantization is performed by applying standard concepts of qed , such as normal - mode techniques @xcite .",
    "in particular , extensions of the theory to one @xcite and two semi - infinite dielectric walls @xcite , thin metallic films @xcite , and cylindrical and spherical dielectric bodies @xcite have been given , and the problem of force fluctuations on short time scales has been studied @xcite .",
    "the calculations have typically been based on macroscopic qed , by applying normal - mode decomposition and including in it the bodies by the well - known conditions of continuity at the surfaces of discontinuity . since in such an approach",
    "the dependence on frequency of the response to the field of the bodies can not be properly taken into account , material dispersion and absorption are ignored .",
    "the problem does of course not occur in microscopic qed , where the bodies are treated on a microscopical level by adopting , e.g. , harmonic - oscillator models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "apart from the fact that the calculations are rather involved , the results are model - dependent .    to overcome the difficulties mentioned , in the second route",
    ", the calculations are based on linear response theory , without ( explicitly ) quantizing the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "all the relevant entities are expressed in terms of correlation functions which in turn are related , via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , to response functions .",
    "the method has been employed to investigate the vdw energy of an atom near a semi - infinite ( planar ) body made of dielectric @xcite , metallic @xcite , ionic - crystallic @xcite , and birefringent material @xcite .",
    "further , the problem of an atom near a a dielectric plate @xcite , a metallic sphere @xcite , and a nanowire @xcite has been considered .",
    "since the method borrows from equilibrium statistical mechanics , its applicability is restricted to the vacuum and thermal quantum states .    in this article , we give a unified qed approach to the vdw interaction between an atomic system ( such as an atom or a molecule ) and dispersing and absorbing dielectric bodies including metals .",
    "starting from the quantized version of the macroscopic maxwell field , with the medium being described in terms of a spatially varying , kramers - kronig consistent ( complex ) permittivity , we derive an expression for the vdw potential that applies to arbitrary body configurations .",
    "the formalism can be regarded as being a generalization of the normal - mode formalism of macroscopic qed , so that it can be applied to other than the vacuum and thermal states , and it also allows extensions like the inclusion of dynamical interactions between the atomic system and the medium - assisted electromagnetic field .",
    "roughly speaking , the mode expansion is replaced with some source - quantity representation in terms of the green tensor of the macroscopic maxwell equations , in which material dispersion and absorption are automatically included .",
    "further , we close the gap between the minimal - coupling scheme and the multipolar - coupling scheme by showing that both approaches lead to equivalent results .    to give an application",
    ", we consider the vdw potential of an atom in the vicinity of a dispersing and absorbing microsphere .",
    "microspheres may be interesting candidates for qed experiments ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) with atomic beams .",
    "the atom - surface distances should be adjusted so that the atoms fly close enough to the surface to facilitate a strong coupling with the microsphere resonances , but not get adsorbed on the microsphere surface because of the attractive vdw force .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : basic_eqs ] the formalism is outlined and an expression for the vdw potential is derived . in section",
    "[ sec : appl ] the formalism is applied to an atom near a sphere . a summary and some conclusions",
    "are given in section [ sec : concl ] .",

    "in particular , replacing in the long - distance law the polarizability of the sphere with that of an atom just yields the vdw potential between two atoms . on the other hand , for sufficiently small distances of the atom from the sphere the vdw potential approaches the potential observed for an atom near a planar body .",
    "it is worth noting that in the long - distance limit it is the static permittivity that enters the vdw potential .",
    "hence material absorption has no effect on it .",

    ", we have restricted our attention to ground - state systems and calculated the vdw potential in lowest - order of perturbation theory with respect to the interaction of the atomic system with the medium - assisted electromagnetic field .",
    "the theory allows of course extensions in several respects . as a consequence of the lowest - order perturbation theory , the energy denominators that enter the polarizability of the atomic system are the unperturbed ones , without consideration of the level shift and broadening caused by the presence of the bodies .",
    "in fact , the polarizability of an atomic system is expected to drastically change when it becomes close to a macroscopic body and the spontaneous decay thus becomes purely radiationless , with the decay rate being proportional to @xmath210 @xcite .",
    "since the level broadening is essentially determined by the spontaneous - decay rate , the polarizability becomes distance - dependent  an effect that needs careful consideration .",
