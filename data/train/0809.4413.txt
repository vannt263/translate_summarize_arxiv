    "liquid xenon is one of the most attractive materials for use in detectors for astroparticle and particle physics @xcite . as a scintillator",
    "it has a large light yield , comparable to that of nai(tl ) , and can be used for detectors with low energy thresholds and high energy resolution . because of the high atomic number of xenon ( @xmath1 ) and its high density in liquid form ( @xmath2 3 g/@xmath3 ) , it contributes to the reduction of environmental backgrounds , such as @xmath4-rays and @xmath5-rays from uranium and thorium contamination , by self - shielding .",
    "another big advantage of liquid xenon is that xenon does not have long - lived radioactive isotopes , and thus experiments on rare phenomena ( such as dark matter searches and double beta decay experiments ) may be carried out shortly after moving the xenon underground from the surface .",
    "one drawback of liquid xenon is the possibility of contamination with radioactive @xmath6kr .",
    "xenon is usually produced from air .",
    "the concentration of xenon in air is @xmath7 mol / mol , while the concentration of krypton is @xmath8 mol / mol . in the commercial production of xenon ,",
    "krypton is removed by distillation or adsorption .",
    "but , the commercially available xenon contains @xmath9 mol / mol of krypton , because the removal starts from the kr / xe ratio of about 10 and such purity is enough for most of the applications of xenon .",
    "@xmath6kr is a radioactive nucleus which decays into rubidium-85 with a half - life of 10.76 years , and emits @xmath5-rays with a maximum energy of 687 kev and a 99.57% branching ratio .",
    "( the remaining 0.43% represent a @xmath5-emission with a maximum energy of 173 kev followed by a 514 kev @xmath4-ray emission . ) large quantities of @xmath6kr are produced artificially in nuclear fission .",
    "this constitutes the main source of @xmath6kr in air .",
    "the concentration of @xmath6kr in air is measured to be @xmath10 bq / m@xmath11@xcite , which corresponds to @xmath6kr / kr = @xmath12 .",

    "they are commonly used industrial processes but systems which reduce kr enough to meet our requirements did not exist . a development of adsorption - based chromatography to achieve the required kr concentration is reported in ref.@xcite . in this paper , we describe the development of a distillation system to reduce krypton to a level of 10@xmath19 . in section 2 , the design principle is discussed , while in section 3 , the setup and operation of the distillation system are described . in section 4",
    ", we describe a technique for measuring low levels of krypton in xenon gas , and discuss the results .",
    "the boiling point of liquid krypton is 120 k at 1 atmosphere , while that of xenon is 165 k. this means that , in principle , separation of krypton and xenon can be performed by a distillation method . for the basic design of the distillation system",
    ", we followed the mccabe - thiele ( m - t ) method@xcite .",
    "it is the standard method of designing a distillation system . at first",
    ", the concept of the m - t method is reviewed , and then the application of the method for our purpose is described .",
    "the principle of the m - t method is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : design ] .",
    "the main element in the distillation system is a tower in which gas - liquid equilibrium is maintained .",
    "a vessel called a `` reboiler '' , at the bottom of the tower , boils the liquid using a heater . in order to maintain a constant temperature profile in the tower ,",
    "a condenser is placed at its top .",
    "the supplied xenon gas is cooled down to near boiling point , and then supplied to the feed point in the tower at a flow rate @xmath20 , as shown in the figure .",
    "the processed xenon , which contains a lower concentration of krypton than the original xenon , is obtained from the reboiler ( flow rate @xmath21 ) , and xenon with a higher krypton concentration is obtained at the top of the tower ( flow rate @xmath22 ) . in the following , the kr concentration of xenon at these points is expressed as @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the heating power of the reboiler and the cooling power of the condenser at the top of the tower control the flow of xenon in the tower ( flow rate @xmath25 ) .",
    "the reflux ratio , represented by @xmath26 , indicates the amount of xenon returned to the tower compared with the amount extracted with a high concentration of krypton .    in the m - t method ,",
    "the distillation tower is assumed to be a connected series of theoretical cells , with the gas - liquid equilibrium changing by one step in each cell .",
    "the number of theoretical cells is calculated for given boundary conditions of @xmath20 , @xmath22 , @xmath21 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath24 and @xmath29 .    for an equilibrium of liquid and gas phases in a mixture of elements ( in this case , kr and xe ) , the partial pressures of the gas - phase elements ( expressed as @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively ) can be related to the fraction of each element in the liquid phase ( expressed as @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) by raoult s law : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the vapor pressures of the corresponding elements ( 2090 kpa and 201.4 kpa , respectively , at 178 k ) . using raoult s law , the concentrations of kr in the gas phase ( @xmath37 ) and the liquid phase ( @xmath32 )",

    "figure [ fig : design](b ) illustrates the method of estimating the number of required theoretical cells .",
    "we designed the distillation tower to fulfill the following requirements :    * the kr concentration of the processed xenon should be three orders of magnitude smaller than that of the original xenon sample , i.e. @xmath47 . *",
    "the collection efficiency of xenon should be 99% , i.e. @xmath48 = 0.99 and @xmath49 = 0.01 .",
    "* the system should have a process speed of 0.6 kg xe per hour , which allows 100 kg xenon to be purified within one week . *",
    "the system should have a reflux ratio of @xmath29 = 191 , which means the heating power required for the reboiler is 14 w. * xenon should be fed into the system in the gas phase , i.e. @xmath46 = 0 .    a m - t diagram based on these requirements is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] , in which the concentration of kr in original xe(@xmath27 ) was assumed to be @xmath50 , the actual value of the processed xenon described in section 4 .",

    "a key element of the distillation system is the packing column in the distillation tower .",
    "we used `` dx laboratory packing''(sulzer co. ) with a diameter of 2 cm .",
    "the catalog specifications of the packing included a liquid load ( defined as the flow per unit area per unit time ) between 0.1 and 5 @xmath51 . in our case , the liquid load is 1.2 @xmath51 for a reflux ratio @xmath29 of 191 .",
    "gas loads , defined as @xmath52 ( where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are gas velocity and density , respectively ) , are 0.11 pa@xmath55 and 0.23 pa@xmath55 for below and above the feed point , respectively .",
    "the catalog of the packing gives the height equivalent to a theoretical plate ( hetp ) for the distillation of a ethylbenzene / chlorobenzene mixture .",
    "the given hetp value is 2@xmath28 cm for the gas load of 0.2 - 1.2 pa@xmath55 .",
    "however , since the hetp value might strongly depend on the liquid / gas loads and the type of liquid used , we conservatively enlarged the hetp value to 35 cm for the kr / xe distillation in the design , and the total length of the tower is set to 208 cm .",
    "the feed enters the tower 10.8 cm from the top .",

    "when we found that the liquid level around @xmath25 could be measured more precisely by the monitored pressure of the purified xenon , the flow rate of the xenon feed was fine - tuned to balance the output flow .",

    "when the kr arrived at the output line of the gc , the line was connected to a metal filter ( nihon seisen co. , pore size 0.003 @xmath70 m ) which was cooled by liquid nitrogen , and the kr was trapped by the metal filter .",
    "the trapping efficiency was evaluated based on the results obtained for the calibration gas , and was found to be as high as 80% .",

    "the helium carrier gas was then used to transfer the kr trapped in the metal filter to the api - ms .",
