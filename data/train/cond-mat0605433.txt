    "the bechgaard salts are organic conductors which have attracted much interest over the last thirty years  @xcite . upon variation of the pressure , the temperature , and the anion  @xmath0 in ( tmtsf)@xmath1x and ( tmttf)@xmath1x ,",
    "these compounds exhibit a rich phase diagram , e.g. , a superconducting phase is found to lie in - between a paramagnetic metallic phase and a spin - density - wave phase .",
    "the systems can be regarded as quasi one - dimensional due to the strong anisotropy of the transport along the three crystalline axes .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite support the view that the metallic phase can be characterized as a tomonaga  luttinger liquid at temperatures @xmath2 k. indeed , signatures of the tomonaga ",
    "luttinger liquid are the reduced density of states at the fermi energy as seen in angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy  @xcite , the negative temperature dependence of the c - axis resistivity  @xcite , the scaling behavior of high - energy range of the optical conductivity  @xcite , the power - law temperature dependence of the hall coefficient  @xcite , and the empirical relationship @xmath3 between the measured spin relaxation rate and the magnetic susceptibility in nuclear magnetic resonance measurements  @xcite .",
    "moreover , distinctly different thermal conductivities for the charge and spin excitations have been reported which provide evidence for spin - charge separation  @xcite .",
    "all correlation functions in the tomonaga  luttinger liquid display a power - law behavior with unusual , interaction - dependent coefficients .",
    "many of them are simple functions of the so - called tomonaga ",
    "luttinger parameter  @xmath4 .",
    "most experiments give @xmath5 for the bechgaard salts . the single - band hubbard model",
    "in which spin-1/2 electrons move on a chain and interact only locally is one of the best studied hamiltonians for correlated lattice electrons .",
    "however , the model gives @xmath6 for all interaction strengths which shows that the long - range parts of the coulomb interaction must be taken into account for a proper description of the bechgaard salts .",
    "in the extended hubbard model the long - range parts of the coulomb interaction are mimicked by a nearest - neighbor term  @xcite .",
    "other factors may also play an important role .",
    "for instance , the stacks of tmttf and tmtsf molecules form dimerized chains and the alternation of the electron transfer - matrix elements along the chain must be considered .",
    "therefore , in this work we study the one - dimensional extended hubbard model with alternating hopping amplitudes , i.e. , the one - dimensional dimerized extended hubbard model as the minimal one - dimensional , purely electronic model for the electronic excitations in the bechgaard salts .",
    "the relevant bands in the tmtsf and tmttf salts are filled with three electrons so that the system is quarter - filled in hole notation , and we use the hole picture in the following .",
    "there are few systematic studies of the dimerized extended hubbard model in the literature .",
    "therefore , we investigate the model for various band fillings , with an emphasis on the vicinity of the commensurate fillings . in this way , our principle investigation of correlated electrons in quasi one - dimensional dimerized systems could be relevant also for other materials , e.g. , for the inorganic spin - peierls system cugeo@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "in our work we apply the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method which is one of the most reliable numerical methods to study the low - energy properties of one - dimensional correlated electron systems .",
    "where applicable , we compare our results to the predictions from field theory and effective single - band hubbard models .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : modelmethod ] we define the dimerized extended hubbard model and introduce the physical quantities of interest , namely , the spin gap , the charge - density - wave ( cdw ) order parameter , and the tomonaga  luttinger parameter . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we separately present our dmrg results for the dimerized hubbard model with and without the nearest - neighbor interaction , and discuss the experimental relevance of our investigations .",
    "we close with a short summary in sect .",
    "[ sec : sum ] .",
    "in order to model the bechgaard salts , we focus on the transport of a chain of stacked molecules and regard a single tmttf or tmtsf molecule as a site . the chain has a geometrical ( peierls ) modulation . besides the intra - molecular coulomb interaction",
    ", we should take into account a nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion because of the fairly short inter - molecular distance .",
    "thus , our model hamiltonian of choice is the one - dimensional dimerized extended hubbard model for spin-1/2 electrons on  @xmath8 lattice sites @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath12 at site  @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the number operator , and @xmath15 .",
    "the total number of electrons is @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the average number of electrons per lattice site .",
    "the electron transfer matrix elements @xmath18 and @xmath19 model the dimerization of the chain , @xmath20 is the strength of the hubbard interaction , and @xmath21 parametrizes the nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion .",
    "we call a pair of sites which is connected by the hoping amplitude  @xmath18 a ` dimer ' .",
    "the dimerization splits the tight - binding cosine band into a bonding band ( ` lower peierls band ' ) and an anti - bonding band ( ` upper peierls band ' ) .",

( [ krhoquarter ] ) . as expected from field theory  @xcite , and confirmed numerically , we have @xmath104 for the density - driven mott transition for _ all _ interaction strengths .",
    "this follows from the mapping of the quarter - filled dimerized hubbard model to the effective single - band hubbard model at half band - filling .",

    "the spin gap in the ladder system remains finite for finite hole doping .",
    "there the spin - singlet pairs themselves are mobile so that in the ground state an additional pair of holes is actually confined to a rung because the gain in kinetic energy due to the hole motion is smaller than the combined loss in the pairing energy and the kinetic energy of the spin dimers .",

    "i.e. , in the extended single - band hubbard model , @xmath133 is finite above @xmath138 , in agreement with previous work  @xcite .",
    "apparently , the dimerization enhances the charge fluctuation on each dimer , and , consequently the tendency towards charge order is reduced .    in the presence of a dimerization the critical value for the onset of the cdw increases with increasing dimerization .",
    "moreover , @xmath139 rises up sharply above @xmath140 even when @xmath92 is close to unity .",

    "gives @xmath197 .",
    "the good agreement of the experimental and theoretical data for @xmath75 implies that the nearest - neighbor interaction ought to be rather small . in particular",
    ", the a value @xmath198 for ( tmttf)@xmath1pf@xmath185 , leads to @xmath199 , a factor of two smaller than the experimental estimate .",
    "additinally , with small @xmath21 to adjust @xmath200 , the resulting theoretical prediction for @xmath201 from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] is not compatible with the experimental estimate , @xmath202 .    in order to reconcile this discrepancy",
    "we note that , in the esr measurements , the curves are fitted to provide a good agreement with the eggert  affleck  takahashi model  @xcite for the spin susceptibility of the @xmath203 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain at elevated temperatures",
    ". however , substantial deviations occur for small temperatures , @xmath204 .",
    "they could be the result of a dimensional crossover  @xcite and the transition to the cdw phase .",
    "we are tempted to attribute the deviations to an effectively larger nearest - neighbor interaction at low temperatures .",
    "recall that our electronic model is purely one - dimensional , and neither covers the influence of phonons  @xcite nor does it give an account on the screening of the electron - electron interaction which may change drastically in the vicinity of the transition to the cdw state .",
    "therefore , temperature may have a quite substantial influence on the value of the effective @xmath21-parameter in our model so that eq .",
    "( [ fulljeff ] ) can not be applied with the values for @xmath134 at @xmath205 to explain the susceptibility data for @xmath206 .",
    "in fact , in the cdw phase , the effective exchange interaction is given by @xmath207 which results in @xmath208 if we use the parameters for ( tmttf)@xmath1pf@xmath185 .",
    "if the spin susceptibility could be measured in the ( one - dimensional ) cdw phase , the exchange interaction should be an order of magnitude smaller than in the high - temperature phase .    in ( tmtsf)@xmath1pf@xmath185 ,",
    "the hopping amplitudes are estimated as @xmath209 and the effective coulomb interactions are found to be weaker , @xmath210 .",
    "again , a weak nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction , @xmath211 , would account for an exchange interaction @xmath212 which is compatible with the high - temperature experimental observation @xmath213 .",
    "using the dmrg method , we provided numerically exact results for the spin excitations , the cdw order parameter , and the tomonaga  luttinger parameter of the one - dimensional dimerized extended hubbard model at and near commensurate fillings .    in the presence of a dimerization we confirm numerically that gap for the spin excitation is finite at half band - filling .",
    "however , the gap immediately disappears when the system is doped infinitesimally because there is no mechanism which confines the holes to a single dimer .",
    "this result is qualitatively consistent with a rapid suppression of the spin gap with zn doping in the spin - peierls heisenberg system cugeo@xmath7  @xcite , irrespective of the difficulty in metalization this material  @xcite .    for the tomonaga ",
    "luttinger parameter the effects of the dimerization are weak in the absence of the nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction  @xmath21 and away from quarter filling . at and near quarter filling ,",
    "the lower peierls band is essentially half filled and the dimerized hubbard model at filling @xmath214 can be understood qualitatively and even semi - quantitatively in terms of an effective single - band hubbard model at electron density  @xmath215 . from the result of the corresponding hubbard model at half band - filling it immediately follows that @xmath153 holds for the dimerized hubbard model at infinitesimally doping away from quarter filling .",
    "therefore , the tomonaga ",
    "luttinger parameter for the weakly doped quarter - filled system sensitively depends on the strength of the dimerization . in general",
    ", the dimerization tends to reduce @xmath4 gradually because the effective scattering processes within the peierls bands increase with the size of the peierls gap .    in the presence of the nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction , the case of quarter",
    "filling also deserves special attention because the mott  hubbard insulator goes over to a cdw insulator with a finite spin gap at a critical interaction strength  @xmath130 .",
    "the dimerization opposes the formation of the cdw phase , for example , the critical nearest - neighbor interaction shifts from @xmath216 in the absence of dimerization to @xmath217 in the dimer limit .    the suppression of the charge order at quarter filling by the dimerization is reflected in a tendency to stabilize the metallic state by the dimerization away from quarter band - filling .",
    "however , the increase of the electron - electron scattering by the nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction overcomes that tendency and results in a net reduction of @xmath4 as a function of the dimerization and the nearest - neighbor interaction , see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . as a consequence , fairly small values , @xmath192 , can be obtained for a moderate five - percent doping of the quarter - filled dimerized extended hubbard model at moderate coulomb couplings , @xmath161 , @xmath218 .",
    "it is difficult to reconcile all experimental data for the bechgaard salts with our findings for the dimerized extended hubbard model in one dimension . in order to find small values for the tomonaga ",
    "luttinger parameter , the coulomb interactions must be large enough to reach the region of a ( doped ) cdw insulator which is not easily reconciled with the high - temperature data for the exchange interaction .",
