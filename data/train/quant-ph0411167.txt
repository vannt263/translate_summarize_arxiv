    "it is a generally accepted principle of modern physics that absolute physical quantities have no intrinsic usefulness or physical relevance .",
    "while the issues had been debated for centuries , they found their modern expression with mach , whose influence on einstein during his formulation of general relativity is part of physics mythology .",
    "understanding to what extent various theories are ( or can be made ) completely relational ( machian ) is , however , a somewhat slippery business .",
    "for example , the machian features of general relativity were elucidated most clearly by barbour and co - workers years after einstein s original publication @xcite .",
    "part of the problem when trying to examine issues of relationalism in physics , is that we generically are forced to describe our physical surroundings in terms of some specific _ reference frame_. a reference frame is simply a mechanism for breaking some symmetry , and if we are careful then we need to describe the reference frame itself in terms of the specific physical objects of which it is comprised . for internal self - consistency , this procedure should be undertaken within the confines of the physical theory under examination .",
    "once we have done so , it is perilously easy to describe physics once again in `` absolute '' terms - properties look absolute with respect to the one fixed reference frame . to avoid this pitfall",
    "one common procedure is to examine the _ translation _ of the physical description from one observer s reference frame to another , and such translation yields insight into the relational features of the physics under consideration .    in applying this sort of thinking to quantum mechanics several problems present themselves fairly quickly .",
    "the first is that of setting up a reference frame described in purely quantum mechanical terms .",
    "the extent to which this is a problem depends upon the extent to which one is prepared to accept classical objects and fields within the theory .",
    "opinions vary . at one extreme classical clocks , spatial reference frames and the like",
    "are simply presumed to exist ; the quantum mechanical systems under investigation are taken to couple to the classical reference frames in such a way that , for example , `` position of the object '' is by fiat well defined after an appropriate measurement .",
    "this is the common perspective taken when teaching wave - mechanics for instance . at the other extreme , popular in certain approaches to quantum gravity , every reference frame object ( clock , pointer , etc ) is assigned a quantum mechanical state .",
    "issues surrounding the macroscopic limit ( or otherwise ) of these objects must then be tackled .",
    "the second main set of problems encountered quantum mechanically are related to dynamics .",
    "issues of the specific dynamical couplings between the objects under investigation and the objects comprising the frame become important , most notably the effects of `` backreaction '' .",
    "the specific dynamics involved are also of importance in trying to examine how one might translate between physical descriptions of the same system by two different observers .",
    "the inevitable disturbances that arise in quantum mechanical procedures one observer may implement in order to fix a system with respect to their frame , generically force a dynamical examination of translation into a different observer s frame ( as opposed to the kinematical translation possible in classical theories ) .    in this paper",
    "we examine some simple dynamical mechanisms wherein some relationally defined degree of freedom of two systems becomes well localized ( in some sense `` classical '' ) with respect to some specific observer .",
    "in particular we consider two systems initially uncorrelated with respect to some relative degree of freedom , and examine processes whereby an observer may induce a correlation .",
    "we focus on measurement based schemes , i.e. situations wherein the observer seeks to establish correlation by appropriate measurement .",
    "in contrast to most situations when studying quantum measurements , wherein the information obtained about the pre - measurement state is the priority , here we are interested in controlling the properties of the induced post - measurement state .",
    "this sheds light on certain process whereby an observer may use one system as a reference for another .",
    "we examine the speed at which these references are created , and the stability of the relationship once established .",
    "we look at cases wherein the initial states of the systems under consideration are mixed , in addition to the more commonly considered pure state case .",
    "a final set of issues of interest in examining relationalism in quantum mechanics involves conservation laws , superselection rules and symmetry breaking . in algebraic quantum field theory , the existence of absolute conservation laws and associated superselection rules ( rules forbidding the creation of superpositions of states with different values of the conserved quantity ) is taken to be true axiomatically @xcite . a less absolutist , and more operational , approach",
    "was initiated by aharonov and susskind @xcite .",
    "they suggested that forbidden superpositions can in fact be observed provided that the apparatus used by an observer are prepared in certain special states .",
    "the states suggested by aharanov and susskind were not particularly realistic . we present as an alternative certain mixed states with well localized relative phase , which are much more experimentally feasible , and can reproduce the desired effects with no loss due to the lack of purity .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec : rlopticalphase ] by considering the localization of relative optical phase , given two cavities of photons initially in fock ( number ) states . aspects of this problem were analyzed numerically by mlmer @xcite and analytically by sanders et al @xcite . in an ideal setup a `` relational schrdinger cat state '' emerges , and we discuss how slight imperfections lead to destruction of the cat .",
    "we progress to the mixed state case investigating the localization between two poissonian or two thermal states , introducing a two mode visibility for rigorous comparison .",
    "in particular , we show that the localization of the relative phase of the mixed states is just as good as for the pure states in these cases .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : rlatomicphase ] we look at the interference of two bose condensates , a process in which relative localization of atomic phase plays an important role .",
    "a numerical analysis was performed by javanainen and yoo @xcite , and some analytic analysis was given by castin and dalibard @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we borrow from our study of localizing optical phase and see in particular that the localization of atomic phase takes place on the same rapid time scale , and much faster than is apparent in the simulated spatial interference of javanainen and yoo .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : rlposition ] , we turn to the localization of relative position , a problem studied recently by rau et al @xcite . we extend their results to scenarios involving initially mixed states and less specialized scattering processes which generate only partial localization .",
    "we begin our study of relative localization in quantum mechanics by examining in detail the dynamical localization of the relative phase of two , initially independent , single modes of light .",
    "a simple operational procedure for both causing and probing such localization is depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : twocavities ] .",
    "two cavities initially containing @xmath0 and @xmath1 photons respectively ( and thus described by pure initial states @xmath2 ) both leak out one end mirror ( via linear mode coupling ) .",
    "their outputs are combined on a 50:50 beamsplitter , after which they are detected .",
    "photon number states leak out of their cavities and are combined on a 50:50 beamsplitter .",
    "the two output ports are monitored by photodetectors .",
    "the variable phase shift @xmath3 is initially fixed at 0.,height=226 ]    despite the cavities being in fock states with no well - defined relative phase , it is well known that an interference pattern is observed at the two detectors .",
    "the interference pattern can be observed in time if the two cavities are populated by photons of slightly differing frequencies or , as in standard interferometry , by varying a phase shifter placed in one of the beamsplitter ports .",
    "the reason for this contradiction with the naive dictum `` number and phase are conjugate quantities '' may be understood as follows :    consider the case after a single photon has been detected at one of the detectors .",
    "then the new state of the two cavities is @xmath4 i.e. it is entangled .",
    "it is simple to show that the second photon is much more likely to be detected at the same detector .",
    "the exact ratio of the probabilities of being counted at the same detector and at the other is @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "when @xmath7 this ratio is strictly greater than @xmath8 , and tends sharply to infinity as @xmath0 and @xmath1 approach @xmath9 .",
    "this is in agreement with the phenomenon , demonstrated by the well - known hong , ou and mandel dip experiment @xcite , whereby two uncorrelated and identical photons , simultaneously incident on the input ports of a @xmath10 beamsplitter , must both be registered at the same output port .",
    "further detections lead to a more and more entangled state .",
    "it is not so surprising then that detections on an entangled state lead to some form of interference pattern .",
    "in essence , after a small number of detections the relative number of photons in each cavity is no longer well defined , and so a well defined relative phase can emerge . note",
    "that this is only possible if the beamsplitter , detectors and cavities all have well defined relative positions .",
    "one method for confirming this intuition is to use a quantum jumps approach ( for a review of quantum jump methods see @xcite and references therein ) , and numerically simulate such a system through a number of detection procedures as was performed in @xcite .",
    "however such simulations yield little in the way of physical insight . as such ,",
    "we follow instead a procedure introduced in @xcite .",
    "we begin by expanding the initial state @xmath11 of the cavities in terms of coherent states @xmath12 :    @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and the normalization @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the poissonian distribution . for the moment we will ignore normalization .",
    "consider now the case that a single photon is detected at either the left detector @xmath17 , or the right one @xmath18 .",
    "since we are interested only in the change of state in the cavity modes , we treat the exterior modes as ancillas , and find the kraus operators @xmath19 describing the effect of the detection ( for an explanation of quantum operations see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "it is reasonably simply to verify that they are proportional to @xmath20 , where @xmath21 are annihilation operators for the modes in cavity @xmath22 respectively .",
    "the constant of proportionality depends on the transmittivity of the end mirrors .    in the event that some number @xmath23 of photons are detected in @xmath17",
    "while @xmath24 photons are detected in @xmath18 , the state of the two cavities evolves as follows : @xmath25 in order to understand the localization in relative phase which occurs between the two cavities , we need to consider the co - efficient c_l , r(-)^l ( + ) ^r . for our purposes",

    "in practise we find that the schrdinger cat is sensitive to any asymmetry , or instability in the system .",
    "the effect of a randomly varying phase is to cause localisation about _",
    "one _ particular value of the relative phase .",
    "this phenomenon is evident in the numerical studies of molmer @xcite .",
    "these incorporate a slight frequency difference between the two cavity modes causing the free evolution to have an additional detuning term @xmath76 .",
    "combined with the random intervals between detections , this means that the process can be described by kraus operators @xmath77 where the phase @xmath3 takes random values for each photodetection .",
    "the relative phase then takes a unique value varying randomly for each run .",
    "a dynamically equivalent process occurs when atoms from two overlapping bose einstein condensates drop onto an array of detectors and are detected at random positions ; a detailed discussion of this point follows in sec .",
    "[ sec : rlatomicphase ] .",
    "in the case of an idealized setup , in which the phase shifts throughout the apparatus remain fixed , one component of the relational schrdinger cat state can be removed manually .",
    "we suppose that after @xmath23 and @xmath24 photons have been detected at @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the usual way the phase shifter is adjusted by @xmath69 and that the experiment is continued until a small number of additional photons have been detected .",
    "the phase shift translates the interference pattern in such a way that with high probability the additional counts will occur at one detector .",
    "these additional measurements eliminate the unwanted component of the cat state and confirm a well defined relative phase .    the next important feature we turn to concerns the robustness of the localization . in the limit of a large number of detections ,",
    "the state of the two cavities becomes equivalent to [ eqn : psiinfinity ] |_= de^-2i||^2    with @xmath78 some coherent state . the coherent states , being minimum uncertainty gaussian states , are the most classical of any quantum states",
    ". thus we expect states of the form @xmath79 to be robust . however , @xmath80 is a superposition over such states , and this could potentially affect the robustness . that this is not the case ,",
    "can be understood by noting that the superposition in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : psiinfinity ] ) is summed over the global phase @xmath75 .",
    "this is still a relative phase between different states in the fock state expansion of a coherent state .",
    "] of the coherent states . under evolutions obeying an additive conservation of energy rule ( photon - number superselection ) , which is essentially the extremely good rotating - wave approximation of quantum optics ,",
    "this global phase becomes operationally insignificant .",
    "this is discussed in a little more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : superselection ] below .",
    "finally we point out that a state of the form eq .",
    "( [ eqn : psiinfinity ] ) is , for any processes involving relative phases between the cavities , operationally equivalent to a tensor product of pure coherent states for each cavity @xmath81 .",
    "however , because of the phase factor @xmath82 , the state is , in fact , highly entangled .",
    "if we expand it in the ( orthogonal ) fock bases , as opposed to the non - orthogonal coherent states , we find a state of the form @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes a product of photon number states , @xmath85 denotes a poissonian factor and @xmath86 is a whole number of photons .",
    "the example of the previous section , while usefully illustrating many features of relative localization , is not experimentally accessible due to the assumption that we have access to large photon number , initially pure , fock states populating the cavities . in particular , if we are looking for a mechanism by which relative localization occurs naturally in our interactions with surrounding objects , the previous example is somewhat implausible as it stands , in as much as it would suggest that macroscopic levels of entanglement are necessary to localize relative degrees of freedom .    with this in mind , we turn to a more realistic scenario . while it is implausible that the cavities are populated by large fock states , it is _ not _ implausible that they are populated by a large number of photons , and that all we know is the mean number @xmath87 of photons . in such a situation",
    "we would assign the quantum state of the cavity as a poissonian distribution over photon number ( if we were following a maximum entropy principle ) .",
    "alternatively , we may be populating the cavities by ( independent ) light from lasers , in which standard laser theory leads to the photon number distribution being poissonian @xcite .",
    "as such , we reconsider the above localization procedure , assuming now that the initial state of the cavities is @xmath88 and @xmath89 . as in the previous section ,",
    "we consider the evolution of @xmath90 given that @xmath46 photons are detected at the left and right detectors respectively : latexmath:[\\ ] ] the first and last contributions can be resolved in terms of gamma functions as for the probability above , and the second term evaluates to @xmath40 .",
    "so , @xmath261 and extremizing at @xmath136 and @xmath262 , @xmath263",
    "the calculations follow a similar line to the poissonian case above . the initial state of the two cavity fields , a product of two thermal states with the same average photon number @xmath87 , @xmath264 where @xmath265 and @xmath266 acquires a factor , @xmath267 extracting the @xmath23 and @xmath24 photon components of the coherent states , under the canonical localizing process .",
    "the calculation for the intensity @xmath92 for @xmath253 proceeds as follows , @xmath278 now , @xmath279 and the latter two contributions integrate to @xmath40 .",
    "hence , @xmath280 evaluating the integrals is as for the probability calculation above . @xmath281 and",
