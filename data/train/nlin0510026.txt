    "we argue that the bottleneck effect is seen when the length of inertial range is insufficient for the energy cascade process .",
    "the basic idea presented in our paper is as follows : in a fully - developed turbulence , a flux of energy is transferred from small wavenumbers to large wavenumbers .",
    "this process involves interactions of large number of modes  from small wavenumbers to large wavenumbers .",

    "the remaining portion of energy flux , which is a huge fraction ( @xmath23@xmath24 ) , is transferred to the distant shells .",
    "this result is in agreement with earlier simulation results @xcite .",
    "the above arguments imply that for an effective cascade of energy , there must be a large enough range of wavenumbers . ideally , when kolmogorov s wavenumber @xmath25 , kolmogorov s cascade is setup , and the energy spectrum is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : kolm - ek ] ) . however , if kolmogorov s wavenumber is not sufficiently large , the cascade process faces difficulty ; at higher wavenumbers there are not enough number of modes to receive the energy transferred from the smaller wavenumbers . to compensate , the wavenumbers near kolmogorov s scale have a higher energy level .",
    "we propose this to be the main reason for the bottleneck effect .",
    "note that the energy fed at small wavenumbers fixes the level of energy spectrum in the inertial range , and the energy input has to be dissipated at the higher wavenumbers . in the following discussion we will present a quantitative arguments to support the above idea .",
    "the average energy flux from a wavenumber sphere of radius @xmath26 is given by @xcite@xmath27 where @xmath28 is the `` _ _ mode - to - mode energy transfer rate _ _ '' in a triad ( * p , q , k ) * with @xmath29 , and @xmath30 represents the ensemble average .",

    "both these methods use quasi - normal approximation , and eddy or renormalized viscosity .    in the subsequent subsections",
    "we will use the above formalism to compute energy fluxes using energy spectrum obtained from a model and direct numerical simulation .",

    "this result indicates that the bottleneck effect decreases with the increase of inertial range , thus reinforcing our hypothesis that the bottleneck effect may be due to nonavailability of sufficient range of wavenumbers to facilitate energy cascade .",
    "please note that we have quantified the bottleneck effect by the size of the hump in the _ normalized energy spectrum_. in individual energy spectrum the size of the hump could depend on the energy input rate etc .",
    "also , we observe a hump at low wavenumbers which is due to the forcing at these scales .",
    "the focus of this paper is on the hump at @xmath51 and we will not analyze the one at the lowest waveumbers .",
    "let us compare the above energy spectra with a model energy spectrum for a turbulent flow @xcite@xmath52 where @xmath53 with forcing wavenumber @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . throughout this paper",

    "the choice of @xmath56 is based on batchelor s spectra @xcite for smaller wavenumbers .",
    "there is no hump in the model spectrum because of the choice of its functional form .",

    "1 we plot @xmath49 , which is given by@xmath65 as expected , @xmath49 with higher @xmath4 produces a larger inertial range .    in the following subsection",
    "we will compute energy flux by substituting the above energy spectra ( dns and model ) in eq .",

    "they provide important clues for the bottleneck effect .",
    "first , we compute the flux @xmath66 by substituting the model energy spectrum [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : ek - all ] ) ] in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pik0 ] ) with @xmath64 .",
    "we compute the integral @xmath67 ( the bracketed term of eq . [",
    "[ eq : pik0 ] ] ) for various values of @xmath4 . when @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the integral @xmath70 independent of @xmath26 , implying that the flux is independent of @xmath26 for the kolmogorov energy spectrum @xmath71 . using @xmath72 we find the kolmogorov constant , @xmath57 ( this is how @xmath3was computed in @xcite ) .",
    "after this the integral @xmath67 is computed using the model spectrum with @xmath56 , @xmath55 , and @xmath73 .",
    "the value of @xmath67 starts from 0 at @xmath74 , reaches a peak , and then it decays .",
    "the energy fluxes at various wavenumbers are@xmath75 with @xmath57 . fig .",
    "2 contains plots of @xmath34 vs. @xmath26 for different values of @xmath76 .",
    "the maximum values of @xmath34 for these cases are listed in table 1 .",
    "they are all less than 1 , but the difference from the actual value ( 1 ) is lower for larger @xmath4 . theoretically @xmath77 must be 1 because the energy input at small wavenumber is 1 . _",
    "the reason for the decrease in @xmath77 is the lack of modes in the inertial range .",
    "_ this is where the hump in the energy spectrum near dissipation wavenumber comes into play .",
    "after the flux calculation for model spectrum , we compute the flux integral using @xmath49 obtained from dns at @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 grids , and obtain @xmath78 . these values are listed in table 1 .",
    "the value of @xmath78 for @xmath46 is very close to unity .",
    "clearly the energy spectra obtained from numerical simulations provide a better handle on energy flux as compared to the model energy spectrum [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : ek - all ] ) ] .",
    "this is because of the higher level of energy spectrum ( hump ) near kolmogorov s wavenumber in the dns ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , which makes up for the loss of large wavenumber modes .",
    "the overall effect is that the energy flux in high - resolution dns is closer to what is expected in an idealized situation when @xmath25 .",
    "thus consistency with kolmogorov s theory is achieved .",
    "the value @xmath78 for @xmath44 is somewhat higher than 1 , which may be to approximations made in our theoretical calculations .",
    "the dns plots of fig .",
    "2 are the fluxes computed by substituting the dns energy spectra in eq .",

    "this exercise was done to examine the effects of the bottleneck correction in the flux . in fig .",
    "3 we plot the normalized energy flux computed directly from dns data on @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 grids .",
    "the two figures match qualitatively , but not quantitatively because of the assumptions made in the field - theoretic calculation .",
    "the coupling of wavenumber modes in forced , inertial range , and dissipation range is not yet fully understood to be able to resolve @xmath66 completely from theory @xcite .    in the present subsection we showed that the bottleneck correction near the dissipation range helps in the effective transfer of energy flux . in the next subsection",
    "we estimate the extent of the bottleneck effect to the mechanism proposed in our paper .      in this subsection we will attempt to estimate the extent of the bottleneck effect using semiquantitative arguments .",
    "because of a lack of complete understanding of the coupling between the forced , inertial , and dissipative scales , this is the best we can do at present .",
    "verma et al .",

    "the wavenumber space is divided into various shells logarithmically . in verma",

    "spectrum @xmath84 was assumed through out the wavenumber space .",
    "they found that the energy transfer is maximal to the nearest neighbour , yet significant energy is transferred to other shells .",
    "for example , the energy transfer rates from @xmath18th shell the shells @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 are 18% , 6.7% , and 3.6% respectively .",
    "the transfer rate decreases monotonically for more distant shells .",
    "let us imagine a wavenumber sphere of radius @xmath88 somewhat in the middle of the inertial range . using the shell - to - shell energy transfer rates we can compute the energy transfers from the above wavenumber sphere to @xmath79 shells adjacent to the sphere ( wavenumber range @xmath89)$ ] .",
    "simple algebra shows that the above quantity is @xcite@xmath90 in table 2 we list @xmath91 for various values of @xmath79 .",
    "the table shows that 42.2% of the flux is transferred to the three adjacent shells . _ to transfer 99.1% energy we need 28 shells in the right of the sphere .",
    "_ therefore , we require large number of wavenumber shells for effective energy transfer , and the bottleneck effect is expected if the inertial range is insufficient . in this theory , the bottleneck effect would disappear when there are sufficient wavenumber shells to enable the complete energy transfer .",
    "the energy transfer among the wavenumber shells is antisymmetric , that is @xmath92 . if we assume the above mentioned waveumber sphere to be in the middle of the inertial range , we require approximately @xmath93 shells for an effective energy transfer . hence , the inertial range @xmath94 required must be around @xmath95 .",
    "hence our estimate for the minimum length of the inertial range for no bottleneck effect is approximately four decades .",
    "the range of inertial range in all the experiments and simulations discussed in this paper is less than four decades , and the bottleneck effect is observed in all of them . hence our theoretical estimate is consistent with the present experimental and numerical results .",
    "we remark that the above estimate of the required inertial range for zero bottleneck effect could be an overestimate .",
    "a realistic estimate requires a detailed study of energy transfer among modes in the whole range : forcing , inertial , and dissipation range .    after the above estimation of required inertial range",
    "to suppress the bottleneck , we move on to estimate the increase in the energy spectrum due to the bottleneck effect .",
    "suppose the energy spectrum @xmath0 till the dissipation wavenumber is@xmath96 where @xmath97 is the normalized bottleneck correction . there is a complex interaction between the wavenumbers in the forcing , inertial , and dissipation range , which is not yet completely understood . for time being we estimate the additional energy transfer due to the bottleneck correction to be of the order of @xmath98 .",
    "since the energy supplied at the large - scales has to reach the dissipation scale , and if the number of wavenumber shells to the right of above mentioned wavenumber sphere is @xmath79 , then@xmath99 therefore,@xmath100.\\label{eq : ekd}\\ ] ] using zhou @xcite and verma et al.s results @xcite that @xmath101 for small @xmath102 , we estimate@xmath103 where @xmath104 is a positive constant . assuming that the we have equal number of wavenumber shells to the left and right of the wavenumber sphere @xmath88 discussed above",
    ", the ratio of kolmogorov s wavenumber and forcing wavenumbers is approximately @xmath105 which yields @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the reynolds number based on kolmogorov s scale . substituting this estimate of @xmath79 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ekd ] ) we obtain@xmath108 which is plotted in fig . 4 for a reference with @xmath109 .",
    "the three points represent the @xmath110 for three dns discussed in the present paper .",
    "the choice of @xmath109 fits best with the dns values , and it is consistent with our @xmath91equation [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : qn ] ) ] .",
    "the numerical values of dns fit quite well with the theoretical predictions , however , we need more dns results for a better test of our theoretical estimate of the bottleneck correction . also , for @xmath109 , @xmath111 for @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "these estimates are in reasonable agreement with our earlier estimate of the length of the inertial range for zero bottleneck effect .",
    "our prediction of @xmath114 is proportional to @xmath115 , and it differs from the predictions of earlier theories .    please note that the above expression for @xmath114 is only a crude approximation , and could be an overestimate . to better understand the bottleneck effect we need to understand the coupling among forcing , inertial , and dissipation scales , as well as other aspects like intermittency .",
    "the dynamics at the dissipation rate is quite important in the study of the bottleneck effect .",
    "this is evident from the numerical observations of lamorgese et al .",
    "@xcite , biskamp et al .",
    "@xcite , and dobler et al .",
    "@xcite who reported that hyperviscosity enhances the bottleneck effect .",
    "since the extent of inertial range increases with the introduction of hyperviscosity , it may appear that the bottleneck effect should decrease in the presence of hyperviscosity .",
    "however , that is not the case .",
    "this result is possibly because of the shorter dissipation range in the presence of hyperviscosity , and the hump in the energy spectrum near @xmath4 could help in the inertial - range energy transfer as well as in the dissipation of energy .",
    "this is an important question to investigate .",
    "so far our focus has been on the physics of energy transfer in the inertial range .",
    "a more detailed study of energy exchange between wavenumbers in the inertial and dissipative range is required for a conclusive statement @xcite .",
    "to summarize , in this paper we investigated the reason for the bottleneck effect in turbulence .",
    "the energy is supplied at large scales , and it cascades to smaller scales .",
    "recent numerical and theoretical studies show that even though most of the energy from a given wavenumber shell goes to the next wavenumber shell , there is a significant energy transfer to the distant wavenumber shells .",
    "we showed that an effective transfer of energy flux in the inertial range can take place when there is approximately four decades of inertial range .",
    "if the inertial range is shorter , a hump is created near kolmogorov s scale ( beginning of dissipation range ) which compensates for the nonexistence of required inertial range .",
    "the bottleneck effect is observed in most of the current numerical simulations and experiments .",
    "the mechanism proposed in the present paper differs from that of falkovich @xcite and yakhot and zakharov @xcite .",
    "falkovich @xcite argued that the bottleneck effect is due to the suppression of nonlinear interactions by dissipative modes , and it is present for all dissipative turbulence systems .",
    "falkovich assumes essentially a local energy cascade in contrast to both local and nonlocal transfers in our mechanism . in our picture , the energy is transferred to the dissipative scales not only from its immediate neighbouring wavenumber shells , but also from the middle of inertial range .",
    "the energy transfer by kolmogorov s spectrum requires certain minimum inertial range .",
    "if this range is not present , the energy levels of the modes near kolmogorov s scales increase to facilitate the energy transfer .",
    "note that if full range of inertial range is present , the last wavenumber shells in the inertial range would transfer only a small fraction of energy flux , and there is no bottleneck effect .",
    "our theory suggests that the bottleneck effect will disappear if the inertial range is more than approximately four decades .",
    "yakhot and zakharov @xcite and she and jackson @xcite obtained @xmath14 bottleneck correction .",
    "our model purely based on energy flux differs from these theories as well .",
    "quantitatively , our prediction for the bottleneck correction @xmath114 is proportional to @xmath115 , and it differs from the predictions of earlier theories .",
    "traditional shell models of turbulence assume local energy transfers , and have a large inertial range ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "the bottleneck effect is generally not observed in the shell models .",
    "however biferale and kerr @xcite report the bottleneck effect in a shell - model ( @xmath117 ) based on kerr - siggia model .",
    "so shell models with small inertial range could show bottleneck effect , but the bottleneck effect in shell model is in the spirit of falkovich s mechanism ; there is not enough dissipative scale to dissipate the cascaded energy .",
    "the `` real '' turbulence however involves local as well as nonlocal energy transfers that are not simulated in local shell models of turbulence .",
    "the recent nonlocal shell models @xcite attempt to model these features of turbulence , and it will be interesting to investigate bottleneck effect in the nonlocal shell models .",
    "we remark that the field - theoretic calculation presented in this paper is more fundamental than the shell model , and some of it s features are same as the shell model .",
    "still it is instructive to independently investigate bottleneck effect using nonlocal shell model .",
    "many important and unresolved issues are involved in the study of the bottleneck effect .",
    "we need to fully understand the nonlinear coupling between the forcing , inertial , and dissipative range ( see alexakis et al .",
    "@xcite , debliquy et al .",
    "@xcite , verma et al .",
    "@xcite , brasseur and wei @xcite for some of the recent attempts ) .",
    "the vortex interactions , intermittency etc . also come up in the study of the bottleneck effect , and we need to understand them better as well .",
    "the energy transfer in the turbulence of passive scalar and magnetohydrodynamics follows similar patterns as in fluid turbulence .",
    "the energy transfer is forward and local , yet significant range of inertial - range is required for effective energy transfer @xcite . hence we expect the bottleneck effect to be present in these systems as well",
