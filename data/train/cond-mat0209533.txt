    "there is considerable current interest in the problem of transport through various nanoscale devices both from the fundamental and from applied points of view . in this connection ,",
    "kubo s transport formulas have to a large extent been superseded by different formalisms in the spirit of bardeen s tunneling model @xcite .",
    "the landauer formula@xcite(lf ) and the keldysh technique@xcite , quantum langevin equations@xcite , @xmath0 algebraic formulas@xcite and generalized scattering theory ideas@xcite have been developed , allowing one to study systems in steady state arbitrarily far from the linear region where kubo is applicable .",
    "there is also considerable experimental activity involving resistive elements , such as quantum dots , stm tips , single walled nanotubes and insulating nanowires , often coming up with unexpected physics @xcite .",
    "the most popular alternative to kubos formulas is the lf , proposed in 1957 @xcite . since then several derivations of the lf have been given @xcite and this has led to a good understanding of the formula .",
    "a large number of experiments are interpreted successfully on the basis of lf .",
    "the quantum of conductance @xmath1 has been understood as a contact resistance which arises due to the squeezing of the reservoir degrees of freedom into a single channel @xcite . while a physically careful statement of the conditions for validity of the lf can be found in ref(@xcite ) , we believe that a detailed mathematical theory of the role of reservoirs and the nature of the coupling between the wires and reservoirs does not exist . the role of the idealized reservoirs has been to serve as perfect sources and sinks of thermal electrons .",
    "this clearly will not be satisfied in all experimental conditions and it is necessary to have a better microscopic understanding of reservoirs and contacts",
    ". there has been some work @xcite in this direction but , to our knowledge , a detailed understanding of the role of reservoirs is still lacking .    in this paper",
    "we adapt a formalism that was developed by ford , kac , and mazur @xcite ( fkm ) and model reservoirs as infinite non - interacting systems .",
    "this method was originally devised to study brownian motion in coupled oscillators @xcite and was later extended to a general study of the problem of a quantum particle coupled to a quantum mechanical heat bath @xcite . in this approach reservoirs",
    "are modelled by a collection of oscillators which are initially in equilibrium .",
    "the reservoir degrees of freedom are then eliminated leading to quantum langevin equations for the remaining degrees of freedom ( the system ) .",
    "thus the reservoirs can be viewed as providing sources of noise and dissipation into the system .",
    "the fkm formalism is thus very direct to interpret and , as we shall demonstrate , is more straightforward to apply than other methods of treating open quantum systems such as the caldeira - leggett@xcite , keldysh @xcite and scattering theory@xcite .",
    "quantum langevin equations have earlier been used in the context of transport in mesoscopic systems and have helped in the understanding of some experimental data @xcite .",

    "here we use the fkm approach to make a detailed study of quantum transport in disordered electronic and phononic systems .",
    "for very general reservoirs we obtain exact formal expressions for currents and local densities in the nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "we find that for a special type of reservoir , the ideal landauer result ( where the conductance is expressed in terms of the transmission coefficient of one - dimensional plane waves ) follows exactly , while for general reservoirs they need to be modified .",
    "we examine in some detail the effect on transport properties that the choice of reservoirs can have and find a number of interesting effects .",
    "for example in the electron case we find that imperfect contacts can lead to an enhancement of conductivity . in the phonon case",
    "we find the surprising result , earlier noted for classical systems , that the heat current @xmath2 in a long disordered wire decays with system size @xmath3 as @xmath4 where @xmath5 depends on the low frequency spectral properties of the reservoirs .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec.i we present the formalism and results for transport in the one dimensional anderson model . in sec.ii",

    "we note that the more popular approach of treating open quantum systems is the caldeira - leggett formulation . in that approach , one deals with density matrices and the treatment becomes complicated . in the context of the present problem one is not really interested in the full distribution but rather in physical observables like the steady state currents and densities and these are basically second moments of the distribution .",
    "the fkm formulation is then more appropriate and for linear systems one can get exact results .",
    "the other approach of treating nonequilibrium systems which has been used quite extensively in the mesoscopic context is the keldysh formalism .",
    "this is a perturbative treatment where one writes equations of motion for a set of green functions and relates them to self energies through the dyson equations .",
    "the current is expressed in terms of these green functions . in special cases",
    "the dyson equations can be solved exactly and indeed some of our results can be obtained @xcite . on the other hand",
    "our method is more transparent and direct .",
    "we integrate out the reservoir degrees of freedom to get effective langevin type equations of motion for the system .",
    "these are solved and quickly lead to useful results on currents and densities of both particle and heat which are automatically expressible in terms of unperturbed green functions .",
    "the connection to scattering theory is also immediate and explicit .",
    "finally one obtains a nice physical picture of the reservoirs serving as effective sources of noise and dissipation . note that our approach makes connections between different approaches such as caldeira - legett , keldysh , scattering theory and the transfer - hamiltonian method .",
    "the fkm was earlier used in studying heat transport in classical disordered harmonic chains and it is particularly nice that the method can be extended to the quantum mechanical regime .",
    "earlier results on classical chains are then obtained as limiting cases .",
    "the more general quantum mechanical results can be expressed in forms where one can see connections with other approaches such as landauer , keldysh , etc .",
    "the dependence of transport properties of a system on the reservoir properties is at first glance a surprsing fact and we briefly comment on this . from our usual experience in the macroscopic world",
    ", one usually thinks of the conductivity of a system as an intrinsic property , not dependent on the properties of reservoirs .",
    "imagine making a measurement of the thermal conductivity of a wire by putting its ends in contact with heat baths at two different temperatures and measuring the resulting current .",
    "the normal expectation is that the answer should not depend on the material properties of the heat baths . and",
    "indeed this expectation holds out true quite often .",
    "one physical way of understanding this is that , as long as the system ( the wire ) is a strongly interacting system , with good ergodicity properties , then one can expect that , soon after contact is made with the reservoirs , the ends of the wire would reach a state of local thermal equilibrium with the reservoirs .",
    "this local equilibrium would be completely determined by just the temperature of the reservoir and this then drives the current in the wire . in the mesoscopic domain",
    "however there are situations when the interactions between the carriers are not strong enough to let the system reach local equilibrium .",
    "and then one finds that the conducting properties of a wire is no longer intrinsic to the wire but depends on details of the reservoirs .",
    "thus any calculation of transport properties would require a detailed modelling of the reservoirs .",
    "an explicit demonstration , of the conditions under which reservoir - dependence goes away , does not seem to exist at present .    as has been shown here the fkm method works as easily for both electronic transport in disordered fermionic wires and thermal transport in disordered harmonic chains . in both cases we are able to obtain exact formal expressions for particle and thermal currents and these have very similar forms .",
    "both depend on details of the reservoir spectral functions .",
    "the usual landauer case where one writes the current in terms of transmission factor of one - dimensional plane waves is shown to follow , exactly , for the choice of one - dimensional reservoirs and perfect contacts .",
    "in general however one needs to use modified landauer formulas and this can be quite crucial in interpreting experimental data . for example we have shown that the oscillations in conductance seen in the experiments by kong et al can not be explained unless the contacts and reservoirs are treated quantum mechanically .",
    "we also find the rather counterintuitive prediction that imperfect contacts can enhance the conductance of a wire . in the phonon case",
    "we make a couple of predictions that are interesting from the experimental point of view : ( i ) the large system size behaviour of the heat current is a power law and the power depends on reservoir properties ( ii ) temperature profiles in perfect wires show somewhat counterintuitive features close to contacts",
    ". it would be interesting to see if our predictions , which are true for strictly one - dimensional chains , can be verified in experiments on nanowires .",
