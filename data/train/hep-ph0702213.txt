    "<S> in particular , it is possible ( i ) to measure the mass of the higgs accurately by tagging the outgoing protons and measuring the missing mass , ( ii ) to study the quantum numbers of the centrally produced higgs system , and ( iii ) to observe higgs production in an environment with a relatively low background . </S>",
    "<S> first there are no soft secondaries generated by the underlying event , and , second , due to a `` @xmath5 '' selection rule @xcite , leading - order qcd @xmath6 production is suppressed by a factor @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the transverse energy of the @xmath9 jets . therefore for a low mass higgs , @xmath10 gev , there is a chance to observe the main @xmath6 decay mode @xcite , and to directly measure the @xmath0 yukawa coupling constant .    </S>",
    "<S> the process @xmath4 , where the + signs denote large rapidity gaps , may be described by the fusion of two pomerons into the higgs boson . however </S>",
    "<S> we must distinguish between the contributions from a small size pomeron ( which can be described by perturbative qcd ) and a relatively large size pomeron ( which must be described phenomenologically ) . </S>",
    "<S> here , we call these _ hard _ and _ soft _ pomerons respectively . </S>",
    "<S> higgs production ( and the background processes ) resulting from the fusion of two hard pomerons is shown diagrammatically in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] , and those obtained from soft pomeron fusion are shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig:2 ] will be evaluated using an ingelman - schlein - like approach @xcite , in which , at some rather low scale @xmath12 , the incoming pomerons may be treated as hadrons whose wave functions contain gluons , followed by the use of the usual collinear factorization formula . thus the central system is produced by the fusion of gluons from two different soft pomerons . </S>",
    "<S> formally , these are _ not _ exclusive processes . besides the higgs boson ( or @xmath6 pair ) , we have at least two secondary gluons  the remnants of the pomerons . however , if these gluons have low @xmath13 they may not be observed experimentally . thus the soft double - pomeron - exchange processes of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] may fake exclusive signals(a , b ) are suppressed by an additional power of @xmath14 in comparison with the corresponding amplitudes arising from hard pomerons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the contributions of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](a , b ) may be important only at low scales @xmath12 associated with the pomeron - parton splitting vertex , where @xmath14 is not too small . ] . </S>",
    "<S> a similar problem may occur for the hard pomerons , where undetected gluons may be emitted from the active @xmath15-channel gluons , labelled @xmath16 and @xmath17 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](b ) are very small @xcite . ] ; for perturbative qcd @xmath6 production of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](d ) , it is possible to emit only one extra gluon , since its colour can be compensated by the colour of the @xmath6 pair .    as mentioned above , the purpose of the present note is to evaluate the size of the backgrounds arising from the types of process shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] , to the exclusive process of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](a ) . that is the background due to additional gluons which escape experimental detection . </S>",
    "<S> we consider both higgs production and the qcd production of a @xmath6 pair , which is one of the main sources of background to the exclusive @xmath0 signal . unlike the irreducible background of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](c ) , the events with additional gluon emission can , in principle , be separated from exclusive production . </S>",
    "<S> however the acceptance and efficiency of the detectors is less than 100@xmath18 , so parts of these types of contribution must be considered as background to the exclusive higgs signal . to suppress this background </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to use the matching condition @xcite , m_missing  =  m_central , [ eq : mm ] between the mass of the centrally produced system ( i ) as measured by the _ missing _ mass to the tagged very forward outgoing protons , and ( ii ) as measured by the mass of the @xmath6 dijet system observed in the _ central _ detector . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the reconstruction of the dijet mass is not very precise . </S>",
    "<S> here we shall allow for a mismatch @xmath19 of 20@xmath18 , which is twice the expected mass resolution of the central detector . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the matching condition , even with this @xmath20 tolerance , puts a strong constraint on the momentum fractions , @xmath21 , carried by the undetected gluon emissions . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](b ) , the requirement that the observed @xmath6 dijet mass should not be much smaller than the mass of the central system as measured with good accuracy by the missing mass to the tagged protons , leads to the constraint  =  >  ( 1- ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : mmcons ] so the fractions @xmath21 are required to be small , that is the pomeron momentum fractions , @xmath22 , carried by the active gluons should be close to 1 .    it is convenient to first compute the background arising from the soft pomeron contributions of fig .  [ fig:2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> often the name double - pomeron - exchange ( dpe ) is reserved for these types of process . </S>",
    "<S> the cross sections can be readily calculated in terms of the usual collinear factorization formula . for the higgs signal of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](a ) , we have  =  s^2_dpedx_1^ dx_2^d_1 d_2  g^d(_1,x_1^,)g^d(_2,x_2^,)(gg h )  , [ eq : soft ] where @xmath23 are the diffractive gluon distributions at scale @xmath24 , and the @xmath25-function reflects the fact that the observed dijet mass should not be much smaller than the measured missing mass , see ( [ eq : mmcons ] ) . the hera data for inclusive deep inelastic diffractive scattering are not sufficient to fix the behaviour of the gluon distribution , @xmath23 , at large @xmath26 . the h1 collaboration present @xcite two preliminary fits ( a and b ) to their recent inclusive diffractive data . in fit </S>",
    "<S> a the gluon distribution , at scales @xmath27 , is almost constant for @xmath28 , whereas in fit b it decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> however only fit b is consistent with the data on diffractive charm and diffractive dijet production . </S>",
    "<S> the mrw analysis @xcite , which allows for the perturbative qcd contribution , gives gluons which have analogous large @xmath26 behaviour to those of fit b. here we will use the diffractive gluon distribution , @xmath23 , found in the recent mrw analysis . </S>",
    "<S> since the diffractive gluons , @xmath29 , vanish the qcd radiation leads to an additional power suppression for values of @xmath26 close to 1 . ] as @xmath30 , the cross section obtained from ( [ eq : soft ] ) turns out to be small ; and much less than the previous evaluations based on the pomwig monte carlo @xcite using old diffractive gluon distributions which were approximately flat for @xmath28 , analogous to those of the h1 fit a. the factor @xmath31 is the probability that the rapidity gaps associated with the soft pomeron exchanges survive population from secondaries from the underlying event . </S>",
    "<S> the value that we use for @xmath31 is given in the footnote of the paragraph containing ( [ eq : m ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the qcd @xmath6 production arising from soft gluons , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](b ) , is calculated using the same expression , ( [ eq : soft ] ) , but with the replacement of the cross section of the signal subprocess , @xmath32 , by that for the qcd subprocess , @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> experimentally it is not possible , and not needed , to access these dpe contributions over the whole phase space . here </S>",
    "<S> we present results for @xmath34 at @xmath35 for the contribution collected in a missing mass window with @xmath36 gev , that looks realistic bearing in mind the mass resolution expected from the roman pots which have been proposed to tag the forward protons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the cross section for the process shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](a ) the integrals over @xmath37 in ( [ eq : soft ] ) are replaced by the factor @xmath38 , since in the limit of a small higgs width , the @xmath39 cross section contains a factor @xmath40 spread over the @xmath20 interval . </S>",
    "<S> ( recall that @xmath20 is controlled by the mass resolution of the @xmath6 dijet system , which is expected to be much larger than @xmath41 . ) on the other hand the qcd @xmath6 production of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](b ) has no corresponding @xmath42-function . </S>",
    "<S> thus the @xmath43 integrals are replaced by the usual logarithmic @xmath44 phase space integral , leading to a factor @xmath45 in the differential cross section @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> the predictions for the processes of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] are shown in the table . </S>",
    "<S> since the diffractive gluon density @xmath23 decreases rapidly as @xmath26 increases , the @xmath46 background of fig .  [ fig:2](a ) is negligible and the @xmath47 contribution of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](b ) is very small .    </S>",
    "<S> .the cross sections @xmath48 ( in units of @xmath49 fb ) of the hard pomeron processes shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] and the soft pomeron processes of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] . in each case </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 branching ratio has been included and a polar - angle cut @xmath50 in the higgs rest frame has been applied to the @xmath9 jet , that is the jet rapidity separation @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> we have taken @xmath52 gev , and assumed that the mass resolutions of the central detector and roman pots are such that they correspond to mass windows @xmath53 and @xmath54 4 gev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath55 is the helicity along the @xmath9 quark line . for the processes of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](b , d ) , we allow for the emission of any number of gluons with transverse momentum @xmath56 gev . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now turn to the processes mediated by hard pomeron exchange . </S>",
    "<S> the background contributions of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](b , d ) are calculated in a similiar way to that which was used to determine the exclusive higgs signal of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> so first we recall the latter calculation , see , for example , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the exclusive higgs cross section is written as the convolution @xcite @xmath57 where the effective luminosity @xmath58 and the @xmath59 subprocess cross section is ( m^2 )  =  2 ^ 2(1- ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : higgs ] the @xmath60 superscript on @xmath61 is to emphasize that each gluon comes from a colour - singlet @xmath15-channel state . the first factor in ( [ eq : m ] ) , @xmath62 , is the probablity that the rapidity gaps survive against population by secondary hadrons from the underlying event , that is hadrons originating from _ soft _ rescattering ; and @xmath9 is the @xmath15-slope which describes the forward proton @xmath63 distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath62 was calculated using a model @xcite which describes soft hadronic data in the cern - isr to tevatron energy range . since at large impact parameters </S>",
    "<S> the opacity of the proton decreases , the rapidity gaps of processes with a larger @xmath15-slope have a greater probability to survive . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , in @xcite it was demonstrated that the ratio @xmath64 is almost constant for relevant interval of values of the slope production processes of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] the corresponding slope @xmath9 is larger than that for the exclusive process of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](a ) , due to the slope @xmath65 of the regge trajectory of the soft pomeron . as a result </S>",
    "<S> we find , using the observed slope of leading protons from diffractive deep inelastic scattering at hera @xcite , that @xmath66 . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 . at the lhc </S>",
    "<S> the value is found to be @xmath67 for @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining factor , @xmath69 , however , may be calculated using perturbative qcd techniques , since the dominant contribution to the integral comes from the region @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the probability amplitudes , @xmath71 , to find the appropriate pairs of @xmath15-channel gluons are given by the skewed unintegrated gluon densities at a _ hard _ </S>",
    "<S> scale @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> since the momentum fraction @xmath72 transfered through the screening gluon @xmath73 is much smaller than that ( @xmath74 ) transfered through the active gluons @xmath75 , it is possible to express @xmath76 in terms of the conventional integrated density @xmath77 @xcite . a simplified form of this relation is @xcite @xmath78,\\ ] ] which holds to 1020% accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath79 accounts for the single @xmath80 skewed effect . </S>",
    "<S> it is found to be about 1.2 at the energy of the lhc .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the @xmath71 s embody a sudakov suppression factor @xmath81 , which ensures that the gluon does not radiate in the evolution from @xmath82 up to the hard scale @xmath24 , and so preserves the rapidity gaps . </S>",
    "<S> the sudakov factor is @xcite @xmath83\\right),\\ ] ] with @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the square root arises in ( [ eq : a61 ] ) because the ( survival ) probability not to emit any additional gluons is only relevant to the hard ( active ) gluon . </S>",
    "<S> it is the presence of this sudakov factor which makes the integration in ( [ eq : m ] ) infrared stable , and perturbative qcd applicable .    </S>",
    "<S> the resulting cross section for the exclusive production of a higgs boson of mass @xmath52 gev is 2.6 fb at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> allowing for the polar - angle acceptance cut ( given in the table caption ) and the @xmath0 branching ratio reduces this by a factor of about 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the table lists the corresponding cross section @xmath34 at @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us allow for extra gluon radiation , which we assume goes undetected if it has transverse momentum @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the diagrams of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](b , d ) show the simplest background contributions of this type , with , respectively , two gluons and a single undetected gluon . </S>",
    "<S> first we evaluate the process of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we might anticipate that this background will cancel the part of the exponent in the sudakov factor of ( [ eq : a71 ] ) which is coming from the phase space which may be occupied by the emitted gluons ( as would happen in the analogous case of photon emission in qed ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , in qcd , the colour correlations lead to an additional suppression of the real coloured gluon emission , so that this cancellation is incomplete . </S>",
    "<S> the colour correlations take the following form @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the active gluons , @xmath86 are correlated in colour with the screening gluon @xmath82 in the amplitude @xmath87 , and not with the active gluons @xmath88 in the complex conjugate amplitude @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> so the uncorrelated active @xmath15-channel gluons @xmath90 and @xmath88 , in @xmath87 and @xmath89 respectively , form the colour multiplets @xmath91 with the probabilities given by the statistical weights c_i  =  ,  ,  ,  . the colour factors for real emission of gluons in each of these multiplets are _ </S>",
    "<S> i  =  3 ,  3/2 ,  0 ,  -1 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these real emissions lead to an exponent analogous to that in the sudakov form factor of the virtual emissions , @xmath81 of ( [ eq : a71 ] ) , multiplied by the corresponding colour factor @xmath92 . then taking each exponent with its weight @xmath93 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain t_g^(real )  =  _ i c_i   ( _ q_t^2^k^2_t , max _ ^x p_gg ( z)dz )   , [ eq : treal ] where @xmath94 , which guarantees that the emitted gluon does not violate the mass matching condition ( [ eq : mmcons ] ) . note that for the colour singlet , @xmath95 , we do get exact cancellation between the real and virtual terms ( as would happen in qed ) , but this only happens with a probability of 1/64 . summing over @xmath96 soft emissions we have _ </S>",
    "<S> n=0^  ( h+ng )  =  _ exclusive  t_g^(real ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : ng0 ] for example , for the emission of only one gluon , we expand the exponent and note @xmath97 , which reflects the impossiblity of emitting only one gluon when producing a ( colourless ) higgs boson </S>",
    "<S> . the right - hand - side of ( [ eq : ng0 ] ) has a symbolic form . </S>",
    "<S> actually @xmath98 must be included inside the @xmath82 integral in ( [ eq : m ] ) . from ( [ eq : ng0 ] ) , the background contribution of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](b ) is given by _ </S>",
    "<S> n=1^  ( h+ng )  =  _ exclusive  ( t_g^(real)-1 )  , [ eq : ng ] where now we include the mass resolution factors . </S>",
    "<S> note that with decreasing @xmath20 the upper limit @xmath74 in the last integral in ( [ eq : treal ] ) decreases and becomes close to the lower limit @xmath99 . in terms of ( [ eq : ng ] ) , it means that @xmath100 and that the probability of extra gluon emission vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> the final result for the cross section of the process of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](b ) , which we label @xmath101 , is shown in the table .    to calculate the background contribution of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](d ) we need only replace the hard subprocess higgs production cross section , ( [ eq : higgs ] ) , by the cross section for the subprocess @xmath102 . at collinear </S>",
    "<S> leading - order , the contribution ( qhc ) to this cross section , assuming helicity is conserved along the @xmath9-quark line , is given by @xcite d^qhc  =   ( ) dcos , [ eq : qhc ] where @xmath103 and @xmath13 are the momentum fraction and transverse momentum of the emitted gluon ; the factor 9/64 embraces the colour factor , and @xmath25 is the polar angle of the @xmath9-jet in the @xmath6 rest frame . </S>",
    "<S> the equation accounts for the emission of the @xmath90-jet in both the @xmath16 and @xmath17 directions . </S>",
    "<S> again , we allow for the emission of additional soft gluons via @xmath98 , as in ( [ eq : ng0 ] ) . since now we no longer have the delta function @xmath104 of ( [ eq : higgs ] ) , we instead must include @xmath44 , as we have done for fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the factor @xmath38 of ( [ eq : ng ] ) is replaced by @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> an important feature is that , due to the @xmath5 selection rule , the probability to emit soft gluons contains a suppression factor @xmath105 in the massless quark limit @xmath106 , see ( [ eq : qhc ] ) @xcite . on the other hand , to satisfy the mass matching condition , ( [ eq : mmcons ] ) , we must have small @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore not surprising that we find that the qhc contribution has a negligibly small cross section .    </S>",
    "<S> the cross section ( [ eq : qhc ] ) only accounts for the `` qhc '' contribution , where helicity is conserved along the @xmath9 quark line . </S>",
    "<S> this is the origin of the @xmath105 suppression factor . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath107 luminosity selects @xmath5 states , the leading - order @xmath108 qhc amplitude is zero . </S>",
    "<S> the emission of extra gluons overcomes this selection rule , but as very soft gluon emissions do not change the original structure of the @xmath108 amplitude , it means that the cross section is suppressed by the factor @xmath105 , see @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the quark helicity non - conserving ( qhnc ) contribution , to the process of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](d ) , does not contain @xmath105 , but instead is suppressed by a factor @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> it is given by d^qhnc  </S>",
    "<S> =   ( ) dcos , [ eq : hnc ] which again allows for the emission of the @xmath90-jet in both the @xmath16 and @xmath17 directions . </S>",
    "<S> formula ( [ eq : hnc ] ) is written in the limit of soft gluon emission . </S>",
    "<S> both this contribution and the leading - order ( lo ) @xmath108 contribution are helicity non - conserving , and hence contain the @xmath7 suppression </S>",
    "<S> . however @xmath110 contains an additional @xmath111 factor in comparison with the lo result for @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , since now the @xmath6 pair is produced in an _ antisymmetric _ colour octet state , the amplitude changes sign under the @xmath112 permutation . </S>",
    "<S> that is , instead of the @xmath113 form of the lo amplitude , we now have a @xmath114 behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> the cos@xmath25 factor reflects the specific invariance under the rotation of the @xmath5 amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath115 background is shown in the table .    strictly speaking </S>",
    "<S> , this @xmath116 contribution should be considered together with the loop correction to the exclusive @xmath6 production of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](c ) , which up to now ( that is at lo ) represents the largest source of background . </S>",
    "<S> the complete virtual loop corrections to @xmath108 is unknown , but is , at present , under study @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is anticipated that it will be negative relative to the lo amplitude , and sizeable .    </S>",
    "<S> of course there are other sources of background , which were discussed in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , for example the misidentification of gluon jets as @xmath9 jets . considering the backgrounds to the exclusive signal , originating from the processes of figs .  </S>",
