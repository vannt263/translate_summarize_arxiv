    "accelerated expansion of our universe , as evidenced by supernovae ia ( sneia ) , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation anisotropies , large scale structure ( lss ) and x - ray experiments , is well documented in literature @xcite . a missing energy component , also known as dark energy ( de ) ( reviewed in @xcite ) with negative pressure , is widely considered by scientists as responsible of this accelerated expansion .",
    "the simplest model of de is the cosmological constant , which is a key ingredient in the @xmath2cdm model .",
    "although the @xmath2cdm model is consistent very well with all observational data , it has the fine tuning problem .",
    "plenty of other de models have been proposed till date ( see @xcite and references therein ) , but almost all of them explain the acceleration expansion either by introducing new degree(s ) of freedom or by modifying gravity @xcite .",
    "evolution of de parameter within scope of a spatially homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model filled with perfect fluid and dark energy components has been studied in @xcite by generalizing recent results .",
    "some well - known cosmological parameters in the framework of interacting generalized holographic dark energy with cold dark matter in non - flat frw universe have been determined in the work of @xcite .",
    "a de model , so - called veneziano ghost de ( gde ) , has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient of this new model is that the veneziano ghost , which is unphysical in the usual minkowski spacetime quantum field theory ( qft ) , exhibits important physical effects in dynamical spacetime or spacetime with non - trivial topology .",
    "veneziano ghost is supposed to exist for solving the @xmath3 problem in low - energy effective theory of qcd @xcite .",
    "although in flat minkowski spacetime the qcd ghosts are unphysical and make no contribution , in curved / time - dependent backgrounds the cancellation of their contribution to the vacuum energy leave a small energy density @xcite @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the hubble parameter and @xmath6 is the qcd mass scale .    in the present work ,",
    "our purpose is to reconstruct @xmath0 gravity based on qcd gde .",
    "the @xmath0 ( @xmath7 is torsion ) gravity is an interesting sort of modified theories of gravity reviewed in @xcite .",
    "various aspects of @xmath0 gravity have been discussed in references @xcite to @xcite .",
    "reconstruction of modified gravity and dark energy is not new .",

    "@xcite derived two alternative holographic solutions for @xmath0 and studied their stability through the squared speed of sound @xmath10 . the current work is largely motivated by the work of the reference @xcite , that investigated cosmological application of holographic dark energy density in the modified gravity framework and employed the holographic model of dark energy to obtain the equation of state for the holographic energy density in a spatially flat universe .    in the current work",

    "one prominent different was that for case i we are staying far below the phantom boundary and in case ii it is getting asymptotic at the phantom boundary coming from @xmath70 . based on this difference of the behaviours of @xmath39",
    "it may be interpreted that case ii i.e. eq . ( [ fre2 ] ) represents a more acceptable model at is can show an approach towards phantom phase of the universe starting from quintessence . due to non - positivity of the squared sound speed @xmath10 as seen in the plots , both of the qcd ghost @xmath0 models are classically unstable against perturbations in flat and non - flat friedmann - robertson - walker backgrounds .",
    "this instability problem is consistent with result presented for qcd ghost dark energy model by @xcite .",
    "however , instability problem raised by negativity of @xmath10 by arguing that the veneziano ghost does not have a physical propagating degree of freedom and the corresponding gde model does not violate unitarity causality or gauge invariance .",
