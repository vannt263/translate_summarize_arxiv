    "for a long period the fractional calculus , that is derivatives and integrals of nonnatural order , was developed as a purely theoretic field @xcite .",
    "very recently , it has been shown that it can be used to explain certain physical problems , and also for processes where memory effects are important @xcite . in this direction , while the classical derivative gives us the instantaneous rate of change of a function , the parameter of the fractional derivative can be understood as a memory index of the variation of the function , taking into account the previous instants .",
    "for this reason , in last years , fractional calculus has been fruitfully applied to different fields @xcite , and in particular to epidemiological models @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to mention some recent works in order to find appropriate fractional analogues of the so - called special functions @xcite .",
    "there exist various definitions riemann , liouville , caputo , grunwald - letnikov , marchaud , weyl , riesz , feller , and others for fractional derivatives and integrals , ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this diversity of definitions is due to the fact that fractional operators take different kernel representations in different function spaces . in a recent work caputo and",
    "fabrizio @xcite introduced a new fractional derivative , analyzed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "moreover , in @xcite another fractional derivative with non - local and non - singular kernel was proposed .",

    "finally , in section [ section:4 ] a numerical scheme for solving fractional initial value problems ( and fractional systems ) involving the atangana - baleanu fractional derivatives is proposed , and some numerical examples are also included .",
    "the exponential function , @xmath0 , plays a fundamental role in mathematics and it is really useful in the theory of integer order differential equations . in the case of fractional order , the mittag - leffler function appears in a natural way .",
    "the function @xmath1 is defined as @xmath2    this function provides a simple generalization of the exponential function because of the replacement of @xmath3 by @xmath4 in the denominator of the terms of the exponential series . due to this , such function can be considered the simplest nontrivial generalization of exponential function .",
