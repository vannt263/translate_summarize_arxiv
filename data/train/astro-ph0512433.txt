    "while cosmology appears to be converging on a `` concordance model '' that describes the universe as inflationary and isotropic , there remain unexplained anomalies in the cmb data , and other models are not yet ruled out .",
    "the _ wmap _ data provide some of the most accurate measurements yet of the cosmic microwave background and contribute to high accuracy determinations of cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "however , there are several studies that show that at large scales , the cmb is not statistically isotropic and gaussian , as predicted by inflation theory @xcite .    in @xcite , we examined a particular set of anisotropic cosmological models : the bianchi type vii@xmath0 class of spatially homogeneous generalizations of friedmann universes that include small vorticity ( universal rotation ) and shear ( differential expansion ) components .",
    "surprisingly , we found evidence that one of these models correlates with the cmb sky and that subtracting this component resolves several of these observed anomalies .",
    "the models used in that study were derived by @xcite and include no cosmological constant component in the total energy density .",
    "the best - fit model found by that study required @xmath2 , implying , @xmath3 , i.e. ,  a significantly negatively curved universe .",
    "@xcite subsequently considered flat bianchi models and sought explicitly to resolve the problems of the low quadrupole and the low-@xmath4 alignments using a statistic constructed to achieve that purpose .",
    "their analysis does indeed find a model that fixes these anomalies , but it remains statistically insignificant as a detection .",
    "our original result has the benefit of being a detection that is based entirely on a simple least - squares fit of the bianchi template to the data , yet we find that it serendipitously resolves several anomalies without that requirement having been built - in to the search algorithm .",
    "the importance of our result , therefore , lies in the fact that it resolves the problems of the low quadrupole , low-@xmath4 alignments , power asymmetry , and non - gaussian cold spot",
    ".    however , both analyses neglect the fact that the existing bianchi solutions include no dark energy component .",
    "furthermore , the best - fit results require an energy content that is consistent neither with other astronomical observations nor with the cmb itself . in this work ,",
    "we present a modification of the barrow et  al .",
    "bianchi type vii@xmath0 solution so that it includes a cosmological constant term in the evolution .",
    "we discuss the impact of that term on the structure of the resulting cmb anisotropy pattern , particularly the degeneracy that is introduced in the model space by the addition of @xmath5 .",
    "we then discuss the viability of @xmath6 models that are morphologically identical to our best - fit @xmath7 models by considering the constraints imposed by different measurements of the cosmological parameters .",
    "first we shall generalize the equations in @xcite to include a cosmological constant @xmath6 .",

    "we start with the equations of motion using expansion - normalized variables ( see , e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore , we assume that the universe is close to a frw at all times and that the tilt velocity of the dust fluid is small ; hence we assume : @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the expansion - normalized shear scalar , @xmath14 is a complex curvature variable , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the tilt components ( see @xcite for details ) . the curvature variables",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 need not be small , and they are related to the group parameter @xmath19 as follows : @xmath20 we also assume that the parameter @xmath19 is not too small : @xmath21 .",

    ", the tilt asymptotically tends to zero at late times . using the above relations",
    ", it can also be shown that for the case of interest , it remains small back to the last scattering surface as well . *",
    "the universe is close to frw at all times .",
    "this assumption is required to make the problem tractable . in a @xmath6-dominated universe ,",
    "the type vii@xmath0 models become close to frw . for the cases in question",
    ", plugging the numbers into the above relations shows that this assumption still holds at the surface of last scattering .",
    "( at very early times , however , this is not the case . )",
    "it is likely that models for which this assumption does not hold at last scattering would then have greater shear effects , but the details would require a more complicated derivation .",
    "* @xcite only consider the contribution from the vorticity that directly involves the shear variables @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the ( expansion - normalized ) shear scalar , @xmath13 , is given by @xmath69 and involves therefore all of the shear components . in @xcite and here , the other shear components have simply been ignored in the calculation of @xmath70 . considering additional shear degrees of freedom",
    "is in principle possible but in practice difficult .",
    "the effect of such additions is one of the largest unknowns in this analysis .      in the presence of the cosmological constant , a universe that is very nearly flat now and that was very nearly flat at the time of last scattering can become significantly negatively curved at intermediate redshifts .",
    "we can see this from eqtn .",
    "[ eq : sigbjorn12 ] above .",

    "the matter dominates and the curvature vanishes , and at low redshift , @xmath5 can dominate , depending on its exact value . at intermediate redshifts ,",
    "however , the universe may become more negatively curved .",
    "for a currently almost flat universe with parameters close to the observed values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the curvature is at most only a few percent ( black curve ) . only for very small matter densities and very large dark energy densities",
    "does the curvature become large at intermediate redshifts . to reproduce",
    "the observed asymmetry with these @xmath75 models requires either a large current negative curvature ( pink and blue dot - dashed curves ) or a very small matter density ( green dashed curve ) .",
    "the addition of a @xmath6 component adds a third parameter to the bianchi parameter space , but there is a degeneracy to the resulting morphology of the bianchi - induced pattern .",
    "the same structure in the induced anisotropy pattern can be reproduced by different parameter combinations .",
    "the addition of dark energy results in a tighter spiral for a given value of @xmath36 , because the redshift to the surface of last scattering corresponds to a larger time difference .",
    "the geodesics have therefore completed more rotations since recombination for a given value of @xmath36 when @xmath1 .",
    "secondly , the focusing of the spiral depends on the curvature between the observer and the last scattering surface .",
    "significant focusing can arise from a universe that is very open now , or from a universe where @xmath6 is large enough to give negative curvature at intermediate redshifts ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : k_z ] . )    three combinations of parameters , for example , can reproduce the same apparent structure on the sky :    1 .",

    "* ) ; 2 .",

    "[ item : three ] @xmath78  i.e. ,  a much smaller than observed matter content , but a nearly flat current curvature ( @xmath79 ) ; the large @xmath6 causes a large negative curvature at intermediate redshifts .",

    "the shear and vorticity values obtained from fitting these templates to the data would change accordingly .",
    "effectively , this implies that a given structure on the sky characterized by the amount of geodesic focusing and the number of spiral turns is the same for all models along a line in the three dimensional parameter space of @xmath82 .",
    "the degeneracy in the templates is only broken by the amplitude of the variation .",
    "but @xmath83 is what we measure by fitting a template to the sky , so we can not distinguish among the degenerate models without an independent measurement of the shear .",
    "it is not straightforward to calculate where such lines of degeneracy lie .",
    "instead , we determine this empirically by generating a grid of models and comparing them to the previously determined best - fit model .",
    "we now address the question of whether the degeneracy of the bianchi type vii@xmath19 models with @xmath84 described in  [ sec : models ] gives us enough freedom to define a bianchi model that is morphologically identical to the best - fit model in @xcite and that is also consistent with estimates of the cosmological parameters .",
    "@xcite describe the limitations of constraining cosmological parameters with cmb data alone .",
    "in particular , there is a geometric degeneracy in the curvature and dark energy density ( or equivalently , the matter density . )",
    "degenerate models have : 1 ) the same values of the physical baryon density , @xmath85 , and cold dark matter density , @xmath86 ; 2 ) the same primordial fluctuation spectrum ; and 3 ) the same value of the parameter @xmath87 & \\text{if } \\omega_k > 0 , \\\\ \\sqrt{\\omega_k}y         & \\text{if } \\omega_k = 0 , \\\\ \\sin[\\sqrt{\\omega_k}y ]   & \\text{if } \\omega_k < 0 , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 ( where @xmath89 is the scale factor at recombination ) .",

    "figure [ fig : degen_cls ] shows that the geometric degeneracy breaks at large angular scales , and the models with high @xmath5 have too much large scale power .",
    "but there is an additional degeneracy if we allow the optical depth , @xmath43 , to vary .",
    "adjusting @xmath43 and @xmath98 such that @xmath108 remains constant has exactly the effect we need of modifying only the large scale power while leaving the peak heights unchanged @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : cls_tau ] shows how this works , but that the effect is not large enough .",
    "even a @xmath43 of zero does not bring the power at large angular scales within range of the data , and that model is inconsistent with the large - scale peak in the te spectrum .",
    "one can also ask if the addition of the bianchi component can affect the variance of the large scale te cross - power , resulting in an incorrect estimate of @xmath43 due to a chance alignment of the polarization signal with the bianchi structure .",
    "simulations with no reionization and with an added bianchi temperature pattern ( the same location and shear amplitude as our best - fit model ) show that this is not the case .",
    "the cross - power remains flat at low @xmath4 with the expected variance .",
    "note that @xcite find different values of @xmath43 derived from fitting temperature data in the northern and southern hemispheres as defined in the frame of reference that maximizes the power asymmetry ( see @xcite . )",

    "* table  3 ) for other estimates of the hubble constant .",
    "high - redshift supernovae observations can break the geometric degeneracy by independently placing constraints that are nearly perpendicular to the _ wmap _ constraints in @xmath115 space ( see figure [ fig : om_ol_space ] . )",
    "the degeneracy curve for the best - fit bianchi model compared to the _ wmap _ data lies outside the @xmath116 confidence contour determined by the supernova cosmology project ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fit  no .  6 ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out that it is not clear whether type ia supernovae are truly standard candles out to high redshift .",
    "the uncertainty , however , is not enough to accommodate such low values of @xmath95 .",
    "the addition of cosmic vorticity and shear would , of course , influence the determinations of such parameters .",
    "the sky coverage of supernova , for example , is fairly extensive outside the galactic plane region , but the sample size is small .",
    "studies such as @xcite have ruled out significant dipole or quadrupole asymmetry in the expansion , but a test for a more complicated anisotropy structure induced by the vorticity would require far more supernova in the sample and a good sky coverage . furthermore , as the current value of the shear expansion is very small , distance measurements to relatively low red - shift ( compared to the cmb ) objects may not be sensitive enough to detect it .",
    "this also implies that such a small current shear would not significantly alter measurements of other cosmological parameters such as the hubble constant that are dependent on relatively low - redshift observations .",
    "one can also ask , then , how much one can vary the parameters of the bianchi model and still have a statistically significant fit",
    ". the most interesting region on figure [ fig : om_ol_space ] is near @xmath117 , where the _ wmap _ and supernovae constraints approach the region of the best - fit bianchi model .",
    "this model resembles the best - fit model , but since it is closer to flat than the bianchi degeneracy curve , there is less geodesic focusing . as a result , the model is not so good a fit to the data , and has a significance , compared to gaussian realizations , of only @xmath118 , compared to over @xmath119 for the model at the same @xmath5 but on the bianchi degeneracy curve .",
    "considering that the _ wmap _ data somewhat favor a closed universe , one might ask about closed models with vorticity and shear .",
    "these are bianchi type ix models , also discussed in @xcite . unlike the open type vii@xmath0 models ,",
    "however , closed models exhibit neither geodesic focusing nor the spiral pattern , even in the presence of vorticity .",
    "barrow et  al .",
    "use them to place limits on vorticity and shear simply using the quadrupole .",
    "such closed models do not reproduce the morphology needed to explain the power asymmetry or the cold spot , and it would be impossible to claim any detection with only the quadrupole as an observable .",
    "the cosmological constant is the simplest form of dark energy , and all observations so far remain consistent with it .",
    "other models are not ruled out , however , and in some cases are favored .",
    "alternatives come in many varieties , some with physical motivation , others constructed to give a particular result .",
    "( see , e.g. ,  @xcite . ) here , we address the question of whether an alternative dark energy model can bring our bianchi pattern any closer to the constraints imposed by the data .",
    "dark energy models are characterized by their equation of state , @xmath120 , where a cosmological constant @xmath6 corresponds to a model with a constant @xmath102 .",
    "alternative theories allow @xmath121 to vary with time , as in `` quintessence '' and `` k - essence '' models .",
    "a rather _ ad hoc _ parameterization is often used of the form @xmath122 , which allows comparison of generic dark energy models with supernova data @xcite .",
    "the derivation in ",
    "[ sec : models ] can be generalized for any dark energy model by the appropriate substitution into equations [ eq : h_of_z ] and [ eq : lambda ] of @xmath123 instead of @xmath5 .",
    "we then have @xmath124 where the function @xmath125 is derived from the equation of state as @xmath126 examples for extreme values of @xmath127 and @xmath128 are shown in figure [ fig : k_z_de ] .",
    "as was shown in figure [ fig : k_z ] , we can look at the evolution of the curvature as a function of time for these models and see if any display the required negative curvature at intermediate redshift . using this parameterization , or",
    "alternatively the parameterization @xmath129 , does not give much additional freedom , however , to create a viable model .",
    "ultimately , the amount of curvature and therefore focusing is still largely a function of the relative densities of matter and dark energy and of the current curvature . manipulating the evolution of the dark energy equation of state simply changes the time scales",
    "on which the transitions between the different components of the density occur .",
    "we have so far ignored an additional issue with these models related to the stochastic component of the cmb .",
    "the analysis in @xcite assumes that the observed cmb anisotropies consist of two independent signals : the predicted bianchi pattern , and a stochastic , statistically isotropic component .",
    "the latter may be generated via inflation or another mechanism , but if it is statistically isotropic at the surface of last scattering , it might no longer be statistically isotropic when observed after traveling through a bianchi universe .",
    "the power spectrum at small scales might deviate from predictions due to additional structure ( dependent on orientation relative to the preferred axis ) introduced by propagation in a bianchi metric .",
    "we note that the asymmetry observed in @xcite and @xcite extends to @xmath130 , while the bianchi model has structure only up to @xmath131 .",
    "geodesic focusing might cause such a power asymmetry , though it might also require that the asymmetry continue to the smallest angular scales , which is not observed .",
    "@xcite also find that some unexplained outliers in the _ wmap _ power spectrum are associated with different hemispheres .",
    "furthermore , the generation of the fluctuations at the last scattering surface might also be affected by the anisotropy , though in the case in question , that anisotropy remains very small ( @xmath132 ) at @xmath133 .",
    "essentially , we expect that the bianchi models could also be constrained by the lack of deviations in the power spectrum from the best - fit _ wmap_/concordance model , although detailed predictions for such deviations are needed",
    ".    the consistency of the acoustic peak scale with the flat concordance model would be very difficult for our best - fit bianchi model to explain .",
    "considering the success of big bang nucleosynthesis in explaining light element abundances , any model that significantly changes the physical processes at those early times must be ruled out .",
    "several studies have thus attempted to place limits on shear expansion and rotation by examining their effect on the relative helium abundance , @xmath134 .",
    "@xcite originally showed that such analysis can place strong constraints on shear .",
    "the interesting exception , however , was type vii@xmath0 models , where barrow found that the cmb remained a stronger constraint .",
    "later studies showed that including more complicated effects can reverse the trend of @xmath134 with the shear ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite revisited the issue and showed that in some cases , even extremely anisotropic models may still have the observed helium abundance .",
    "bianchi type vii@xmath0 models , however , have not been treated in detail since the result of @xcite . after demonstrating for several cases , not including vii@xmath0 , that @xmath134 increases for anisotropic models , @xcite _ conjecture _ that the same trend applies for _ all _ anisotropic models , but they admit that this is difficult to prove .    in short ,",
    "it is possible that such bianchi models are strongly ruled out by bbn and the observed helium fraction .",
    "but this has not been definitively proved .",
    "we have presented solutions for bianchi type vii@xmath0 type universes that include a dark energy term and examined how their morphological properties change over the parameter space .",
    "the addition of dark energy adds a degeneracy such that different combinations of the three parameters @xmath135 can lead to the same observed structure as in the best - fit model of @xcite .",
    "a template can be constructed that has the identical structure of that best - fit model and also falls on the geometric degeneracy curve for the parameters as measured by _",
    "wmap _ data .",
    "this model , however , lies well outside the 95% confidence region in @xmath115 space for _ wmap _ data , ruled out by the over - prediction of large scale power .",
    "it also lies outside the 95% likelihood contours from the supernova cosmology project , and is further inconsistent with the measurement of the hubble constant from the hubble key project .",
    "bianchi models that are more consistent with these other measurements are no longer good fits to the _ wmap _ large scale structure .",
    "one of the most difficult problems for these models is to account for the acoustic peak structure .",
    "the anisotropy at early times might influence the nature of the fluctuations at last scattering , and the geometry could affect the power spectrum on small angular scales due to the geodesic focusing between last scattering and the observer .",
    "detailed predictions for these effects would be needed , but it is difficult to envision such an anisotropic scenario that happened to reproduce the observed acoustic peak structure , mimicking the concordance cosmology so well .",
    "there is currently no prediction for the cmb polarization anisotropy in a bianchi universe , but such a geometry - induced signal could provide an additional test of these models . if the preferred direction indicated in the temperature data is also reflected in the full sky polarization data ( expected from further _",
    "wmap _ data releases and , eventually , from planck ) , there will be even more motivation to consider non - standard models .",
    "we have shown that our best - fit bianchi type vii@xmath0 model is not compatible with measured cosmological parameters , despite the additional freedom from adding dark energy .",
    "it is worth reiterating , however , that the serendipitous discovery of a theoretically derived template that correlates well with the data also happens to resolve several anomalies that can not be explained in the standard picture .",
    "these particular models may not be viable , but lacking any plausible scenario for systematics or foregrounds to be the source of the anomalies , non - standard models that reproduce a similar morphology merit continued interest .",
