    "full diversity and low decoding complexity have been considered as two fundamental properties which a good space - time block code ( stbc ) should possess for multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) wireless communications .",
    "the first orthogonal stbc ( ostbc ) was proposed by alamouti which can achieve full transmit diversity for two transmit antennas@xcite .",
    "inspired by the alamouti scheme , seminal studies focused on the designs of ostbc for its unique orthogonal code structure which ensures a single symbol maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoding @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "however , ostbc suffers from the reduced symbol rate with an increase of the number of transmit antennas , especially when complex constellations are used @xcite . in spite of full diversity advantage , ostbc fails to achieve full channel capacity in mimo channels @xcite . to address the problem of low symbol rate and capacity loss in ostbc , linear dispersion code ( ldc )",
    "was proposed as a full - diversity scheme that is constructed linearly in space and time @xcite @xcite .",
    "the ldc design can be viewed as a linear combination of a fixed set of dispersion matrices with the transmitted symbols ( or equivalently , combining coefficients ) .",
    "diagonal algebraic space - time ( dast ) block codes in @xcite and threaded algebraic space - time ( tast ) codes in @xcite were also proposed as two typical algebraic designs which can obtain both full diversity and full rate with moderate ml decoding complexity .",
    "however , it is noted that the aforementioned high - rate codes rely on ml decoding to collect full diversity which has high decoding complexity .",
    "efficient designs of stbc with low decoding complexity were proposed , such as coordinate interleaved orthogonal design ( ciod ) with single - symbol ml decoding in @xcite and quasi - orthogonal stbc ( qostbc ) in @xcite@xcite , but their rates are restricted by the rates of ostbc .",
    "recently , full diversity achieving stbc based on linear receivers , such as the minimum mean square error ( mmse ) receiver and zero - forcing ( zf ) receiver , were studied and proposed @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that the rates of these stbc based on linear receivers are not more than one . to address the complexity and rate tradeoff , a general decoding scheme with code design criterion , referred to as partial interference cancellation ( pic ) group decoding algorithm , was proposed in @xcite . in the pic group decoding ,",
    "the symbols to be decoded are divided into several groups after a linear pic operation and then each group is decoded separately with ml decoding .",
    "therefore , the pic group decoding can be viewed as an intermediate decoding between ml decoding and zf decoding . apparently",
    ", pic group decoding complexity depends on the number of symbols to be decoded in each group .",
    "moreover , a successive interference cancellation ( sic)-aided pic group decoding was proposed in @xcite .",
    "based on the design criterion of stbc with pic group decoding derived in @xcite , a systematic design of stbc achieving full diversity under pic group decoding was developed in @xcite . in subsequent work , a new design of stbc having an alamouti - toeplitz structure was proposed in @xcite which provides a lower pic decoding complexity compared with the design in @xcite .",
    "however , the decoding complexity of the stbc in @xcite is equivalent to a joint decoding of @xmath3 complex symbols .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a design of stbc with pic group decoding that can achieve both full diversity and low decoding complexity .",
    "the decoding complexity is equal to a joint decoding of @xmath3 _ real _ symbols for @xmath0 transmit antennas , i.e. , only half decoding complexity of the stbc in @xcite . for the proposed stbc , real and imaginary parts of @xmath1",
    "complex information symbols are parsed into @xmath2 diagonal layers and encoded by linear transform matrices , respectively .",
    "the full diversity can be achieved by the proposed stbc with @xmath6 under pic group decoding and with any @xmath2 under pic - sic group decoding , respectively .",
    "the code rate is equal to @xmath7 . in particular , for @xmath4 transmit antennas the code has real symbol pairwise ( i.e. single complex symbol ) decoding .",
    "furthermore , the code rate is @xmath5 .",
    "it should be noted that the existing stbc with single complex symbol ( or real symbol pairwise ) decoding , such as qostbc @xcite , @xcite , and ciod etc . in @xcite",
    "have symbol rates not larger than one .",
    "also the codes with linear receivers have single complex symbol decoding but their rates can not be above one either @xcite .",
    "simulation results show that the proposed code outperforms the ciod in @xcite and the qostbc with the optimal rotation in @xcite for @xmath4 transmit antennas at the same bandwidth efficiency .",
    "moreover , our code guarantees full diversity without performance loss compared with other pic group decoding based stbc in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , but a half decoding complexity is reduced .",
    "it should be mentioned that the major difference between the code in @xcite and the one proposed in this paper is that a complex - valued linear transform matrix is used for input complex signal vector to construct the code in @xcite , whereas in this paper two real - valued linear transform matrices are used for real and imaginary parts of the signals , respectively . by doing so , half decoding complexity can be reduced .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model is outlined in section ii . in section iii ,",
    "a systematic design of stbc is proposed and a few code design examples are also given .",
    "the full diversity is proved under pic group decoding in section iv . in section",

    "then , for group @xmath52 a group zf is applied to cancel the interferences coming from all the other groups , i.e. , @xmath55 , followed by a joint decoding of symbols corresponding to the group @xmath52 .",
    "note that the interference cancellation ( i.e. , the group zf ) mainly involves with linear matrix computations , whose computational complexity is small compared to the joint decoding with an exhaustive search of all candidate symbols in one group . to evaluate the decoding complexity of the pic group decoding",
