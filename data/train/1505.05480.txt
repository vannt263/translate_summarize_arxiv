    "binary supermassive black holes ( sbhs ) are naturally formed in galaxy mergers , if both merging galaxies contain a central sbh .",
    "the heavy objects quickly sink to the center of the merger remnant due to dynamical friction and form a binary system .",
    "subsequent evolution of the binary is driven by interaction with stars in the galactic nucleus , which are ejected by the slingshot mechanism @xcite if they arrive within a distance @xmath2 from the binary center of mass , where @xmath3 is the semimajor axis of the binary orbit . as a result ,",
    "the orbit shrinks ( hardens ) , and if the binary becomes sufficiently hard , emission of gravitational waves ( gws ) becomes the main source of energy loss , rapidly bringing the two sbhs to coalescence .",
    "the efficacy of this process , however , depends crucially on the supply of stars into the loss cone ( the low - angular - momentum region of phase space in which stellar orbits can approach the binary ) , and if the reservoir is depleted , the binary nearly stalls , or at least its shrinking timescale may become much longer than the hubble time @xcite .    in idealized spherical galaxies ,",
    "the only guaranteed mechanism of loss - cone repopulation is two - body relaxation .",
    "the problem of feeding stars into the loss cone of the binary has much in common with the similar problem for a single sbh , which was extensively studied in the 1970s in the context of spherical systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these papers identified an important distinction between empty- and full - loss - cone regimes : in the former , the flux of stars is inversely proportional to the relaxation time and depends on the size of the loss cone only logarithmically , while in the latter the relaxation is so efficient that the supply of stars into the loss cone becomes independent of the relaxation time and proportional to the size of the loss cone .",
    "relaxation times in real galaxies are so long that they are nearly always in the empty - loss - cone regime .",
    "the conjectured stalling of the binary evolution has been labeled the `` final - parsec problem '' @xcite .    on the other hand , in non - spherical galactic potentials the angular momentum of stars changes not only by two - body relaxation , but also by large - scale torques ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) .",
    "the orbital structure of non - spherical galaxies is rather diverse , and in triaxial galaxies there exist an entire class of centrophilic orbits , ( e.g.  box or pyramid orbits ) that may attain arbitrarily low values of angular momentum without any relaxation .",
    "these orbits were identified as a promising mechanism of loss - cone repopulation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , in an axisymmetric potential only one component of angular momentum is conserved , and the number of stars that can enter the loss cone is much larger than in the spherical case @xcite , although not as large as in a triaxial system .",
    "numerical simulations of the evolution of binary sbhs face an important difficulty : since the number of particles @xmath0 in a typical simulation ( @xmath4 ) is several orders of magnitude smaller than the number of stars @xmath5 in a real galaxy , it is necessary to properly understand the scaling laws .",
    "the rate of collisional evolution is inversely proportional to the relaxation time , which scales roughly as @xmath6 , while collisionless effects are essentially independent of @xmath0 . even if only the collisional effects play a role in the dynamics , the hardening rate scales differently in the empty- and full - loss - cone regimes . for small @xmath0",
    "the system is in the latter regime and the hardening rate is nearly independent of @xmath0 , while for large @xmath0 the hardening rate should drop with @xmath0 .",
    "early studies were restricted to rather low values of @xmath0 and hence did not find any @xmath0-dependence of the hardening rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while in more recent simulations of isolated spherical systems with larger @xmath0 the hardening rate was found to decline with @xmath0 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although less steeply than the @xmath7 dependence expected in the empty - loss - cone regime . on the other hand , simulations that considered isolated triaxial @xcite or axisymmetric @xcite systems , or started from a merger of two galaxies , which need not result in a spherical model , typically find no dependence of hardening rate on @xmath0",
    "this has been interpreted as a sign that the binary remains in the full - loss - cone regime due to efficient reshuffling of angular momenta of orbits by non - spherical torques .    in a previous paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we reconsidered binary hardening in isolated galaxies with different geometries ( spherical , axisymmetric and triaxial ) using high - resolution @xmath0-body simulations with @xmath0 up to @xmath8 .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , we found that the hardening rates do depend on @xmath0 in all three cases , although they decline less rapidly with @xmath0 for non - spherical models . with the exception of the highest-@xmath0 integrations",
    ", there was almost no difference between axisymmetric and triaxial models .",
    "we also explored the possible contribution to the hardening rate from collisionless effects , by analyzing the properties of orbits in our models and estimating the draining rates of centrophilic orbits .",
    "we concluded that with presently accessible values of @xmath0 it is difficult to disentangle collisional and collisionless effects in loss - cone repopulation . in real galaxies , however , collisional effects are expected to play a much smaller role , so that it is hard to draw firm conclusions about the evolution of binary sbhs in non - spherical galaxies based on conventional @xmath0-body simulations .    in this study , we return to the topic and present a novel monte carlo method that can be used to model the evolution of galaxies hosting binary sbhs .",
    "our new algorithm contains an adjustable rate of relaxation , which can even be set to zero , yielding the collisionless limit . we demonstrate that in this limit , triaxial systems have enough centrophilic orbits to maintain an adequate supply of stars into the loss cone , although the binary hardening rate is not as high as in the full - loss - cone regime and slowly declines with time",
    "nevertheless , for all reasonable values of the parameters , the coalescence time is shorter than the hubble time .",
    "we therefore conclude that the final - parsec problem is solved by triaxiality even in a purely collisionless stellar system .",
    "by contrast , in axisymmetric and spherical galaxies the hardening rate rapidly drops in the absence of relaxation , meaning that in most galaxies the binary would never merge .",
    "crucially , collisional relaxation in conventional @xmath0-body simulations overwhelms the depletion of the loss cone and completely changes the long - term behavior of the binary .    in section  [ sec : method ]",
    "we describe the monte carlo method used in this study and compare it to previous similar approaches , while in section  [ sec : tests ] we validate the method against a large suite of conventional @xmath0-body simulations with @xmath9 .",
    "section  [ sec : evol_isolated ] is devoted to a detailed study of the evolution of isolated galaxy models , constructed initially as equilibrium configurations in spherical , axisymmetric and triaxial geometries .",
    "we present the results of monte carlo simulations and illustrate the trends found in long - term evolution with simple analytical arguments . based on these results , we compute coalescence times for binary sbhs as a function of galaxy structure and initial parameters of the binary orbit . in section  [ sec : evol_merger ] we conduct @xmath0-body simulations of mergers and compare them to monte carlo models",
    ". finally , in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we summarize our important results and compare them with previous work on the final - parsec problem .    as in , we focus on purely stellar - dynamical processes . for a broader picture , including the effects of gas - dynamical torques , see section 8.4 of @xcite or the recent review of @xcite .",
    "some preliminary results from the work presented here were described in @xcite .",
    "we consider the evolution of a binary sbh composed of two point masses , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which are on a keplerian orbit with semimajor axis @xmath3 and eccentricity @xmath12 .",
    "the total mass of the binary , @xmath13 , is a small fraction ( @xmath14 ) of the total mass of surrounding stellar distribution .",
    "the mass ratio of the binary is @xmath15 .",
    "a star passing at a distance @xmath2 from the binary undergoes a complex scattering interaction and is ejected with a typical velocity @xmath16 ( the characteristic orbital velocity of the binary ) ; for a hard binary this is higher than the average velocity of the stellar population , thus the star carries away energy and angular momentum from the binary .",
    "the precise definition of a hard binary varies among different studies ; here we adopt that a binary is hard if its semimajor axis is smaller than @xmath17 where , in turn , the radius of influence @xmath18 is defined as the radius enclosing the mass in stars equal to twice the total mass of the binary .",
    "this definition depends on the evolutionary phase , as the slingshot process reduces the density of stars in the galactic nucleus .",
    "the most rapid depletion occurs just after the binary formation , and after the binary becomes hard the depletion slows down considerably . for consistency with merger simulations ,",
    "in which it is not possible to assign any particular value to @xmath18 before the two galactic nuclei have merged , we adopted the convention to evaluate the influence radius _ after _ the hard binary has formed ( see @xcite for a discussion on different definitions of @xmath18 ) .",
    "another important quantity is the hardening rate @xmath19 . in what follows",
    ", we will frequently compare @xmath20 with the reference value @xmath21 that would occur if the distribution of stars in phase space were not affected by the presence of the binary  in other words , if the loss cone was `` full '' .",
    "unfortunately this value also does not have a commonly accepted definition .",
    "for instance , if the stars were uniformly distributed in space , with density @xmath22 and with isotropically directed velocities all of the same magnitude @xmath23 , then the hardening rate can be expressed as @xmath24 where the dimensionless coefficient @xmath25 can be measured from scattering experiments ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and has a value @xmath26 in the hard - binary limit .",
    "a more widely used definition applies to systems with a uniform density and a maxwellian velocity distribution with dispersion @xmath27 : @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "the assumption of a uniform - density background is clearly an oversimplification , and a more robustly defined quantity is obtained by averaging the single - velocity hardening rate ( [ eq : s_uniform ] ) over the actual distribution function of stars @xmath30 in the entire galaxy .",
    "if we assume that the latter is isotropic ( i.e. , depends only on the energy @xmath31 , but not on the angular momentum ) , then @xmath32    here @xmath33 is the depth of potential well of the stellar cusp ( excluding the potential of the sbh ) , so that the integration includes energies corresponding to stars that are unbound to the binary , but still bound to the entire galaxy ( this is a rather ad hoc convention , but it is justified by the fact that few stars remain bound to the binary for any significant time after it becomes hard ) .",
    "another derivation of this quantity from a somewhat different perspective can be found e.g.  in , equations  ( 7)(9 ) , or in section  8.3 of @xcite . note that the above value has no relation to the total mass of stars in the galaxy , which is given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the density of states and rapidly rises with @xmath31 .    yet",
    "another way to define a reference hardening rate is to substitute the density and velocity dispersion evaluated at @xmath18 into equation  ( [ eq : s_maxwell ] ) @xcite .",
    "this definition has the advantage of being easily computed from quantities that are accessible to an @xmath0-body snapshot , without the need to calculate the distribution function ; on the other hand , it reflects only the local parameters near the galaxy center and not the entire population of stars that can interact with the binary .",
    "since the velocity dispersion can itself be expressed as @xmath36 , we may write @xmath37 which agrees quantitatively with the if here the dimensionless factor @xmath38 can be chosen to match the previous definition ( [ eq : s_isotr ] ) ; its value depends weakly on galaxy structure and lies in the range 35 .    in what follows",
    ", we will refer to either @xmath39 or @xmath40 as the `` full - loss - cone hardening rate '' .",
    "we stress that there is no fundamental reason to expect that the actual hardening rate will be close to @xmath21 , since the distribution of stars at low angular momenta is not isotropic , and even the value of @xmath21 need not remain constant in time ",
    "it merely serves as a useful reference value .",
    "the loss of energy and the evolution of eccentricity due to the emission of gws are given by the following expressions @xcite : @xmath41    throughout the paper , we will mostly present the results in dimensionless @xmath0-body units , with the mass and the scale radius of the galaxy model both set to unity .",
    "the models may be scaled to a given galaxy using any two out of three fundamental scales ( length , time and mass ) . to simplify the discussion",
    ", we reduce this freedom to a one - parameter family of galaxies in which the length and mass scales are related through the @xmath42 relation in the following form ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* fig.12 ) : @xmath43      the monte carlo method used in this work is an extension of the raga code @xcite .",
    "we follow the motion of @xmath0 particles in the combined potential of the stellar distribution , @xmath44 , and the two point masses orbiting each other , centered at origin .",
    "the orbit of the binary is assumed to be keplerian , aligned in the @xmath45 plane , and elongated in @xmath46 direction ; we make no attempt to follow either the change of the orbital plane , which we know to be small from the @xmath0-body simulations ( although it could be quite significant over long timescale in triaxial galaxies , see @xcite ) , or the precession of its periapsis , which we assume is not particularly important for dynamics .",
    "the evolution is broken down into many small intervals of time ( episodes ) of duration @xmath47 ; during each episode we keep the stellar potential and the parameters of the binary orbit unchanged .",
    "each particle is moving independently from the others under the influence of three forces : the gradient of the smooth static stellar potential , represented as a spherical - harmonic expansion with spline - interpolated coefficients as functions of radius ; the time - dependent force from the binary ; and random velocity kicks that model the effect of two - body encounters for a system composed of a certain number of stars , @xmath5 , which does not need to be related to the number of particles in the simulation , and can even be set to infinity ( thus switching off the two - body relaxation ) .",
    "the velocity perturbations are computed from the local ( position - dependent ) drift and diffusion coefficients , using the standard formalism from the relaxation theory and an isotropic approximation for the distribution function of stars ( i.e.   with dependence on energy only ) .",
    "thus our method descends from the spitzer s formulation of monte carlo approach @xcite and does not rely on orbit - averaging , as other contemporary monte carlo codes that use the formalism of @xcite .    during the encounter of a particle with the binary , defined as the time when",
    "the distance of the particle from origin is less than @xmath48 , we record the changes in energy and angular momentum of the particle that arise due to the motion in time - dependent potential of the binary ( not including the perturbations from relaxation or the torque from the non - spherical stellar potential ) .",
    "after each particle s trajectory has been calculated over the entire episode , we sum up these changes for all particles that experienced one or more encounters with the binary , and change the binary s energy and angular momentum by the same amount with the opposite sign , while keeping its orbital phase unchanged from the end of the episode to the start of the next one . thus the stars do not exert force on the black holes directly , but we use conservation laws to impose the changes to the binary orbit parameters .",
    "the binary orbit parameters are optionally modified after each episode according to the expressions for gravitational - wave emission ( [ eq : hardening_gw],[eq : ecc_gw ] ) .",
    "the stellar potential and the diffusion coefficients that account for two - body relaxation are also updated at the end of each episode , reflecting the changes in the stellar distribution in the course of evolution ( here the most important effect is the gradual erosion of the central stellar cusp ) .",
    "it is instructive to compare our method with the other schemes used for an approximate treatment of the joint evolution of the binary and the stellar distribution .",
    "@xcite developed a program scfbdy which combines elements from the self - consistent field ( scf ) method @xcite with a direct integration of black hole  star interactions .",
    "the two black holes were integrated using nbody2 @xcite  a direct - summation code with neighbor scheme , adaptive timestep , and optional two - body regularization , taking into account the forces from all stars individually .",
    "the motion of star particles , on the other hand , was computed in the gravitational potential of the two black holes and the smooth potential of the other stars , represented by a basis - set expansion @xcite .",
    "their approach is quite similar to ours , with the following differences : ( a ) the binary s center of mass is not fixed at origin , although the center of stellar potential expansion is ; ( b ) the star particles exert `` real '' forces on the black holes , which lead directly to the changes in the binary orbit , instead of relying on the newton s third law as in our method ; ( c ) two - body relaxation is not modeled .",
    "they used a rather small update interval for the stellar potential , which could lead to artificial relaxation due to fluctuations in the expansion coefficients @xcite ; in our code we recompute the potential less frequently and use @xmath49 sampling points from each particle s trajectory stored during each episode , to further reduce discreteness noise .",
    "nevertheless , any finite-@xmath0 system is not entirely free of relaxation , so our simulations without explicitly added two - body relaxation should be regarded as an upper limit for the evolution rate expected in truly collisionless systems .",
    "finally , @xcite only dealt with nearly spherical systems , although in principle their scheme can equally well work for non - spherical systems after switching on the corresponding terms in the spherical - harmonic expansion ( as in our method ) .",
    "@xcite used a similar approach in their code eurostar : the two black holes and a subset of star particles with angular momenta lower than a certain threshold are integrated with a direct - summation method , adapted from aarseth s nbody6 code , while the rest of the star particles are followed in the smooth field by a modified version of the scf method .",
    "@xcite used a large suite of three - body scattering experiments to derive the expressions for the rate of hardening and eccentricity growth , extending the results of @xcite to a wider range of mass ratios and eccentricities . @xcite and @xcite developed a hybrid approach for the evolution of the binary , combining the analytical fits to these scattering experiments with a time - dependent model for the loss cone draining and repopulation .",
    "they did not simulate the effect of two - body relaxation and brownian motion of the binary center of mass explicitly , but included some prescriptions to take it into account .",
    "the changes in the stellar potential due to ejection of stars were ignored .",
    "@xcite introduced another scheme based on the conservation laws to find the changes in the binary s orbit .",
    "the motion of stars in the static spherically symmetric potential of the stellar cusp plus the time - dependent potential of the binary is followed over a short interval of time , after which the changes in the total energy and angular momentum of all stars are translated into the forces that should be applied to the black holes .",
    "unlike our method , in which we assume a keplerian orbit for the binary and adjust its parameters on a timescale much longer than the orbital period , their approach requires rather short update intervals to follow the motion of the black holes directly .",
    "compared to the previous studies , our approach most closely resembles that of @xcite and @xcite , in that we also use the spherical harmonic expansion technique to represent the smooth potential of the stellar cluster , which is itself a nearly collisionless system , while considering the interaction between stars and the binary as a succession of three - body scattering events , as in the series of papers by sesana et al .",
    "the treatment of the binary is somewhat more approximate in our method  we assume its center - of - mass to be at rest , and ignore the changes in its orbital plane and orientation of the line of nodes . the evolution of its most important parameters ",
    "binding energy and eccentricity  is deduced from the orbits of stars using conservation laws , in a similar manner to @xcite , but using much longer update intervals , spanning many orbital periods .",
    "the most important new feature of our method with respect to the previous studies is the ability to efficiently model the two - body relaxation with adjustable magnitude , allowing us both to compare our monte carlo simulations with direct @xmath0-body simulations ( using the same relaxation rate ) , and to extend them into nearly collisionless regime , by switching off the relaxation .",
    "planck methods have also been applied to this problem , always in the spherical geometry @xcite .",
    "the fokker ",
    "planck approach has the advantage of a potentially much finer resolution of the loss - cone region in @xmath50 space .",
    "a disadvantage is the need to orbit - average the diffusion coefficients .",
    "our monte carlo algorithm avoids that limitation ; on the other hand , the orbit - averaged approximation only breaks down near the loss cone , and at least in the spherical geometry , a boundary - layer treatment of the loss cone is available that is based on the local ( not orbit - averaged ) fokker ",
    "planck equation and which automatically accounts for empty vs.  full loss cones @xcite .",
    "the secondary slingshot is also more naturally accounted for in a monte carlo algorithm , although it has also been implemented in fokker ",
    "planck treatments @xcite . the primary advantage of our method over fokker ",
    "planck algorithms is the ability to model stellar systems regardless of their shape , including the chaotic orbits that arise in non - spherical geometries",
    ". limitations of our approach include neglect of brownian motion ( justified to some extent below in section  [ sec : evol_longterm_theory ] ) and the assumption of near - equilibrium of the stellar distribution , which means that it is not expected to perform well in highly dynamic situations such as mergers .",
    "it is also worth noting that the method scales linearly with @xmath0 and already at @xmath51 outperforms the gpu - accelerated direct - summation code by a factor of 20 .",
    "we first checked that the results of our calculations do not depend on the technical parameters such as the number of radial grid points in the spherical - harmonic expansion , the update interval , or the type of orbit integrator and its accuracy parameters , provided that they are set to reasonable values .",
    "we also verified that the conservation - law method produces the same results as the scattering experiments of @xcite and @xcite which used a small but non - zero mass of the incoming star , and computed its effect on the binary orbit directly .",
    "in particular , the hardening rates and eccentricity growth rates were found to be comparable to figures 3 and 4 of @xcite for a uniform - density isothermal background population of stars .    next we compared the monte carlo code with a large suite of conventional @xmath0-body integrations of isolated galaxy models with various shapes and initial parameters for the binary .",
    "these were similar to the simulations we used in , but covered a wider range of eccentricities , mass ratios , and density profiles .",
    "the initial density profile of stars follows the @xcite model with the inner cusp slope @xmath52 ( our default model ) and @xmath53 , in three different geometries : spherical , oblate axisymmetric ( axis ratio @xmath54 ) and triaxial ( axis ratios @xmath55  our default model ,  and @xmath56 ) .",
    "these are constructed to be in equilibrium with a central sbh of mass @xmath57 of the total stellar mass , and have a nearly isotropic velocity distribution .",
    "the mass @xmath58 is split between two components of the binary , and the two sbhs are initially placed at a separation 0.2 ( for @xmath52 ) or 0.02 ( for @xmath53 ) , slightly larger than the radius of influence . just after the hard binary has formed ; for instance , in a @xmath52 dehnen model with a single sbh @xmath59 , but after the binary becomes hard , the density cups is eroded and @xmath18 increases to @xmath60 for the models with @xmath61 , changing only slightly in the subsequent evolution . ]",

    "the dependence of hardening rate on eccentricity was found to be weak ; if anything , models with high @xmath12 evolved a little faster , in agreement with the results of scattering experiments of @xcite , @xcite , but typically the difference was comparable to the scatter between individual runs .",
    "the evolution of eccentricity itself is in fact more important , since the energy losses due to gw emission depend strongly on @xmath12 .",

    "this evolution toward axisymmetry clearly occurs due to the binary : if we replace it with a single sbh , the shape stays nearly constant on much longer intervals of time than considered here .",

    "@xcite simulated growth of black holes in triaxial models formed via cold collapse and found that central sbhs containing more than @xmath102 the mass of their host galaxies induced evolution toward axisymmetry .",

    "@xcite demonstrated , using the same monte carlo code , that relaxation is the main driving force behind shape evolution : in the collisionless regime the shape remains nearly constant .",
    "the likely reason is that the diffusion of chaotic orbits , which tends to erase triaxiality , is greatly facilitated by the noise from two - body relaxation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the shape evolution seen in the collisionless simulations with a binary sbh  as opposed to a single sbh  may be caused by resonant perturbations of chaotic orbits by the time - dependent gravitational field @xcite , although more work is needed to explore this effect .",
    "in addition , we performed simulations of models with a steep cusp ( @xmath53 ) and otherwise the same parameters .",
    "they demonstrated a similar behavior , with only the triaxial model continuing to shrink indefinitely in the collisionless case , although the hardening rate was dropping with time more rapidly than in the @xmath52 model .",
    "the loss of triaxiality was mild , much like the @xmath52 model with the same axis ratios ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "before we proceed to a theoretical explanation of the hardening rates , we discuss the properties of orbits in our models .",
    "we have examined the types of orbits that bring stars into interaction with the binary . for each particle that arrives at a distance less than @xmath48 from the center of mass of the binary ,",
    "we record its phase - space coordinates at its first approach .",
    "if a particle is scattered more than once by the binary , we only consider the first interaction , because it is difficult to define unambiguously when one interaction ends and the next one begins .",
    "then we compute a trajectory starting from these initial conditions in a smooth stellar potential plus a _ single _ point mass @xmath104 at the origin , for a time corresponding to 100 orbital periods .",
    "this allows us to use powerful analysis tools applicable to orbits in smooth stationary potentials . to distinguish regular and chaotic orbits",
    ", we use the lyapunov exponent , and to determine if an orbit is centrophilic , we follow the algorithm described in the appendix of .",
    "after the binary became sufficiently hard ( @xmath105 ) , most of the orbits that interact with it are unbound to the binary ( have energies higher than the depth of stellar potential well @xmath33 ) . in the non - spherical cases , almost all such orbits ( @xmath106 ) are found to be chaotic , and for the triaxial system , a similarly large fraction of them are truly centrophilic , i.e.  may attain arbitrarily low values of angular momentum .",
    "there are no genuinely centrophilic orbits in axisymmetric systems , because the variation of angular momentum is bounded from below by its conserved @xmath107-component , but for chaotic orbits the average value of @xmath108 is typically much larger than its minimum achievable value @xmath109 , thus they constitute a reservoir of `` usable '' orbits ( loss region ) that is much larger than the loss cone itself .    regarding the _ overall _ orbital structure of the model , the chaotic orbits are a minority ( @xmath110 , depending on the degree of flattening and triaxiality ) .",
    "as discussed above , the shape of triaxial models gradually evolves toward axisymmetry from the inside out , but globally it remains sufficiently triaxial to support a substantial population of centrophilic orbits  their fraction is roughly proportional to the deviation from axisymmetry , and their total mass is thus considerably larger than the mass of the binary .",
    "the evolution of binary in the collisionless limit can be qualitatively described with a rather simple model for the draining of the population of orbits that can interact with the binary  similar to the one presented in , but without a detailed analysis of properties of orbits in a particular simulation .",
    "we begin with the triaxial case , and assume that at each energy there is initially a fixed fraction @xmath111 of chaotic centrophilic orbits , which occupy the low - angular - momentum region of phase space @xmath112 . to account for their gradual depletion , we introduce the fraction of surviving orbits @xmath113 , so that the mass of chaotic orbits is @xmath114 where we have neglected the @xmath108-dependence of radial orbital period @xmath115 .",
    "the hardening rate due to interaction with these low - angular - momentum orbits is given by a generalization of equation  [ eq : s_isotr ] : @xmath116    on the other hand , the same interactions eject stars and decrease the fraction of surviving orbits . equating the energy carried away by stars with the change in the binary s binding energy gives @xmath117 with @xmath118 is the binary reduced mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* equation  25 ) .",
    "thus @xmath119",
    "if we assume that the stars interacting with the binary become unbound to the galaxy ( i.e. , neglect the secondary slingshot ) , then the draining of the loss region occurs independently at each energy , and we can write the following equation for the evolution of surviving fraction of stars : @xmath120    we take @xmath121 as the new independent variable instead of @xmath122 . substituting ( [ eq : hardening_rate_xi ] ) into the above equation ,",

    "to illustrate this approach and acquire qualitative insight , we consider the asymptotic behavior of the system at large @xmath122 for the case of a power - law density profile , @xmath131 .",
    "pure power - law profiles are unphysical in the sense that the total mass is infinite and the gravitational potential can take arbitrarily large positive values , but the contribution of stars at large radii to the hardening rate is negligible , so that all quantities of interest are finite .",
    "we choose to define the gravitational potential of the stellar cusp so that its value at the center is @xmath132 ; since we only consider stars that are not bound to the binary , their energies lie in the range @xmath133 .",
    "moreover , we may neglect the potential of the sbhs , because at late times most of the surviving loss - region stars are located at far larger distances than @xmath18 .",
    "then all dynamical quantities have power - law dependence on energy : @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 . carrying out the integration in ( [ eq : hardening_rate_xi ] ) , we obtain @xmath137 , and ultimately get the asymptotic dependence of the hardening rate on @xmath3 : @xmath138^{\\frac{2+\\gamma}{6 - 2\\gamma } } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in other words , the hardening rate due to depletion of centrophilic orbits drops with time ( or @xmath139 ) very slowly , and has a moderate dependence on the fraction of chaotic orbits in the model @xmath111 .",

    "since our galaxy models are not scale - free and gradually lose the triaxiality , the hardening rate in the collisionless triaxial model is better described by a somewhat steeper dependence on @xmath3 , namely @xmath149 with @xmath150 ranging from @xmath151 for mildly triaxial @xmath52 models to @xmath152 for more strongly triaxial models or for steeper cusps ( @xmath53 ) , see table  [ tab : s_longterm ] .",
    "the fact that steeper cusps result in a stronger slowdown of hardening rate can be explained by a more rapidly declining dependence of the distribution function on energy : once the centrophilic orbits close to the binary are depleted , there are less available stars at larger distances in models with steeper density profiles .",
    "figure  [ fig : phaseplane_dfevol ] illustrates the above arguments about the size of the loss region and its depletion .",
    "finally , we consider the effects of relaxation on the long - term behavior of the hardening rate . from the above discussion , it is clear that it may only matter for spherical and axisymmetric systems , because in the triaxial case the draining is the main mechanism that keeps the loss cone filled . in general , the relaxation rate scales as @xmath153 , but it does not trivially translate into the hardening rate because of several complications .",
    "first of all , the steady - state flux of stars into the loss cone has a different dependence on the size of the loss cone @xmath154 and the relaxation rate in the limits of empty and full loss cone regimes : in the former case , at a fixed energy it scales as @xmath155^{-1}$ ] , and in the latter  as @xmath156 .",
    "integrated over all energies with an appropriate boundary condition at each energy , the hardening rate has a weaker than @xmath153 scaling , which furthermore depends on the evolutionary stage : as @xmath3 gets smaller , a larger fraction of total flux comes from the full - loss - cone region .",
    "second , the flux of stars into the loss cone is actually higher than the steady - state models would predict , because initially there are large gradients in the phase space : stars with @xmath157 are absent while at larger @xmath108 their distribution is nearly unchanged .",
    "time - dependent models for the loss cone repopulation @xcite predict a flux that is several times higher than the steady - state value at early times .",
    "overall , we find that in the spherical case the hardening rate drops with @xmath5 rather mildly at @xmath158 , but for larger @xmath5 approaches the asymptotic @xmath153 scaling . in @xmath0-body simulations , however , it does not drop quite as fast at large @xmath5 .",
    "one possible reason might be the wandering ( brownian motion ) of the binary @xcite , which effectively increases the size of the loss cone from @xmath159 to @xmath160 .",
    "the wandering radius scales as @xmath161 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus for realistically large @xmath5 it should remain below @xmath3 for the most part of evolution , and will not substantially increase the hardening rate .    relaxation in the axisymmetric case occurs at the same rate as in the spherical system , but the effective size of the loss cone corresponds to the angular momentum of the chaotic region of the phase space @xmath162 , which is then drained into the loss cone proper by the non - spherical torques and not by relaxation .",
    "this suggests that in the empty - loss - cone regime the steady - state flux is moderately ( a factor of few ) larger than in the spherical case @xcite , because it depends only logarithmically on the effective size of the loss region .",
    "time - dependent flux is again higher than the steady - state value , by larger factors than in spherical systems ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , left panel ) .",
    "given these uncertain complications , it is hard to derive more quantitative theoretical estimates for axisymmetric systems .",
    "the results of monte carlo simulations suggest that the hardening rate drops at least as @xmath163 in the range @xmath164 , and probably even steeper at larger @xmath5 , which means that it is too slow for realistic galaxies to bring the binary to gw - dominated regime in a reasonable time .      motivated by the above arguments , we write the stellar - dynamical hardening rate @xmath165 in an evolving model as @xmath166 where the dimensionless coefficient @xmath167 defines the initial value of @xmath165 at the moment of hard binary formation , expressed in the units of `` full - loss - cone rate '' ( [ eq : s_infl ] ) , and the exponent @xmath150 describes its decay with @xmath3 .",

    "if we take into account relaxation - driven repopulation of the loss cone , then equation  [ eq : t_coal_approx ] suggests that the coalescence time may be shorter than the hubble time for @xmath208 and moderate eccentricity ( under the optimistic assumption that the hardening rate , determined from monte carlo simulations to be proportional to @xmath163 , stays at this relatively high value for a much longer time than these simulations were run ) .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    the results , shown in figure  [ fig : merger_hardening ] , can be summarized as follows . in the @xmath0-body simulations ,",
    "the hardening rate was found to be almost independent of @xmath0 , in agreement with other studies . however , the highest-@xmath0 model had a slightly lower hardening rate at late times .",
    "the weaker @xmath0-dependence of hardening rate in merger remnants compared to idealized isolated models could have a number of reasons , e.g.  perturbations from the decaying large - scale clumps and inhomogeneities in the merger remnant are presumably independent of @xmath0 and add up to the conventional two - body relaxation .",
    "this conjecture is supported by the fact that the rate of energy and angular momentum diffusion measured in the simulations is almost independent of @xmath0 and much higher than the rate expected from two - body relaxation .",
    "the eccentricity , being quite high at the formation time , increased further by the end of the simulation , up to @xmath223 for @xmath224 .",
    "we note that the measured hardening rate was @xmath205 times lower than @xmath21 , again underlining that even in strongly asymmetric and dynamic systems the loss cone is at least partially depleted at the highest binding energies .",
    "while the results monte carlo simulations in this section should be regarded as preliminary , it is remarkable that the agreement in hardening rates between @xmath0-body and monte carlo simulations that included relaxation is reasonably good ( figure  [ fig : merger_hardening ] , top panel ) . relaxation driven by large - scale fluctuations in the merger remnant",
    "might be underestimated in the monte carlo method because of two factors : ( a ) the potential represented by spherical - harmonic expansion smooths out small - scale clumps , ( b ) the interval between potential updates is short enough to track global changes in the potential , but may not represent higher - frequency transient perturbations .",
    "thus we should expect somewhat lower hardening rate in monte carlo simulations compared to @xmath0-body simulations ; in fact it turned out to be comparable and even sometimes higher .",
    "we defer a more detailed study of monte carlo models of merger remnants for a future work .    in the collisionless regime ,",
    "the hardening rate is initially only slightly lower than in the @xmath224 simulation with relaxation .",
    "however , it slows down later on , much like in the case of isolated triaxial systems ( table  [ tab : s_longterm ] ) .",
    "again , this is due to two factors : depletion of centrophilic orbits and gradual decrease of triaxiality .",
    "the shape of the merger remant is moderately flattened ( @xmath225 at all radii throughout the simulation ) , and the triaxiality is quite subtle : @xmath226 right after merger and increases to @xmath227 toward the end of simulation .",
    "nevertheless , this appears to be enough to sustain the reservoir of centrophilic orbits needed to keep the binary shrinking . even with zero eccentricity",
    ", the binary would merge in @xmath228  gyr ; with such high eccentricity as in our simulations , this time would be an order of magnitude shorter .",
    "if we force the potential to be axisymmetric , the evolution slows down much faster ( figure  [ fig : merger_hardening ] , bottom panel ) ; by the end of simulation @xmath229 , which is not enough to ensure merger in a hubble time unless the eccentricity is @xmath230 .",
    "in the present work , we have considered a stellar - dynamical solution to the final - parsec problem  the evolution of binary sbhs driven by encounters with stars in a galactic nucleus , as its orbit shrinks from the radius of a hard binary ( @xmath231  pc ) to the separation @xmath232 at which gw emission becomes effective .",
    "the central difficulty is to ensure a continuous supply of stars onto low - angular - momentum orbits , where they can be scattered by the binary and carry away its energy and angular momentum .",
    "this region of phase space , dubbed the loss cone , is quickly depleted by the binary once it becomes hard , so an efficient refilling mechanism is required to enable continued hardening . in a perfectly spherical galaxy , this can only be achieved by two - body relaxation , which is not sufficient to bring the binary to coalescence in a hubble time , except in the smallest galaxies @xcite  hence the problem .",
    "we have focused on the additional mechanisms of loss - cone repopulation that exist in non - spherical ( axisymmetric and triaxial ) galaxies .",
    "we addressed this problem using a variety of methods , but primarily with raga , a novel stellar - dynamical monte carlo code that is able to follow the evolution of non - spherical stellar systems under the influence of two - body relaxation , the magnitude of which can be adjusted  unlike conventional @xmath0-body simulations in which the relaxation is essentially determined by the number of particles .",
    "we extended the code to include interactions between stars and the massive binary , by following the trajectories of particles in the superposition of the smooth galactic potential plus the time - dependent potential of the two sbhs as they orbited one another , and used conservation laws to determine the reciprocal changes in the binary orbital parameters .",
    "we used a large suite of direct - summation @xmath0-body simulations to verify that the monte carlo code accurately describes the evolution of the binary for a wide range of parameters  mass ratio , eccentricity , number of particles and the shape of the galaxy model .",
    "then we extended the monte carlo simulations into the range of @xmath5 much larger than is presently accessible for conventional @xmath0-body simulations , including the intriguing collisionless limit ( @xmath233 ) , which is nearly achieved in real galaxies .",
    "we determined the scaling laws and asymptotic behavior of the stellar - dynamical hardening rate from rather simple analytic arguments , and confirmed these findings with the monte carlo simulations .",
    "taking into account gw emission , the evolution of binary semimajor axis @xmath3 and eccentricity @xmath12 can be described by a simple system of differential equations , which we used to determine the coalescence time as a function of initial parameters of the binary and the galaxy ; these evolutionary tracks were again verified by monte carlo simulations for a few test cases .      1 .",
    "the binary continues to shrink as long as there are stars in the so - called loss region  the region of phase space from which stars can precess into the loss cone proper ( that is , @xmath234 ) due to non - spherical torques . in the spherical case , the loss cone and loss region are the same . in the triaxial case ,",
    "the loss region consists of mostly chaotic orbits , whose total mass is roughly proportional to the mass of galaxy with a coefficient @xmath235 determined by the degree of flattening and triaxiality , and unless the galaxy is nearly axisymmetric , the mass of stars in the loss region is much larger than @xmath104 . in the axisymmetric case ,",
    "the volume of the loss region shrinks with @xmath3 as @xmath236 , halfway between the spherical and triaxial cases .",
    "the stellar - dynamical hardening rate @xmath165 is always smaller than the value @xmath21 corresponding to a full loss cone .",
    "this is explained by a gradual depletion ( draining ) of the loss region , which occurs faster at high binding energies . as a rough estimate , decreasing @xmath3 by a factor of two requires ejection of stars with total mass @xmath237 . in the collisionless limit",
    ", the hardening rate declines with @xmath3 very slowly for a triaxial system , because the total mass of loss region stars is typically large compared to @xmath104 .",
    "by contrast , in an axisymmetric system , the volume of the loss region also shrinks with @xmath3 , and it depletes much faster ; thus the hardening rate declines rapidly and drops nearly to zero at @xmath238 .",
    "this is not enough to bridge the gap to the gw - dominated regime .",
    "3 .   taking into account relaxation - driven repopulation of the loss region does not change the results in the triaxial case very much , because the hardening is dominated by draining of stars that are initially in the loss region , but accounting for relaxation does change the dynamics in the axisymmetric and spherical cases dramatically . after the initial population of the loss region",
    "is nearly depleted , it is refilled by two - body relaxation , maintaing the hardening rate at a nearly constant level that depends on @xmath5 .",
    "the axisymmetric case offers a didactic example of how much a system with @xmath239 , typical of present - day , high - fidelity @xmath0-body simulations , or even @xmath240 , can differ from the collisionless limit in its long - term evolution .",
    "coalescence times estimated for triaxial galaxies weakly depend on the mass of the binary , its mass ratio , or the degree of triaxiality ( provided that the departure from axisymmetry is larger than a few percent ) .",
    "coalescence times fall in the range from a few gyr for almost circular binaries , to @xmath241  yr for very eccentric ones . for a given combination of the binary mass @xmath104 and its radius of influence @xmath18 , the coalescence time",
    "can be computed using equation  [ eq : t_coal_asympt ] for a circular orbit , and using equation  [ eq : t_coal_triax_ecc ] for an eccentric orbit , where the typical values of the dimensionless parameters @xmath242 and @xmath243 are listed in table  [ tab : s_longterm ] .",
    "this time is up to a factor of few times greater than the simple estimate ( [ eq : t_coal_approx ] ) that does not account for the decrease of the hardening rate with time .",
    "consider first the spherical case , which has been extensively studied by @xmath0-body simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , methods based on scattering experiments ( * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , or fokker ",
    "planck models @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that in the spherical case the binary quickly depletes the loss cone and its evolution nearly stalls at a value of @xmath3 just a few times smaller than @xmath69 .",
    "a number of effects may moderately decrease the stalling radius or increase the relaxation rate . the secondary slingshot ",
    "the re - ejection of stars that have once interacted with the binary but did not gain enough energy to escape the galaxy  leads to a gradual ( @xmath244 ) increase of @xmath245 at late times @xcite , and this trend was indeed found in our collisionless monte carlo simulations .",
    "once these stars are completely eliminated , evolution of the binary finally stalls in the purely collisionless case ; @xcite and @xcite found that the stalling radius is only a few times smaller than @xmath69 over a wide range of binary mass ratios and cusp density profiles .",
    "similarly , time - dependent solution of the fokker ",
    "planck equation describing the relaxation of stars in angular momentum yields a higher rate of loss - cone repopulation at early times than the steady - state flux , due to sharper gradients in the phase space @xcite ; this is taken into account automatically in the monte carlo scheme , and does not substantially affect the overall evolution .",
    "brownian motion is not accounted for in our method , and this may be the reason for the discrepancy between monte carlo and @xmath0-body hardening rates at high @xmath0 in spherical systems . @xcite and @xcite argued that wandering of the binary may explain the very weak dependence of hardening rate on @xmath0 found in their simulations .",
    "however , as summarized by @xcite , several factors complicate the interpretation of their result : the @xmath0-body algorithm used in that paper is less collisional than traditional @xmath0-body schemes , but not entirely free of relaxation , and the unequal masses of particles mean that the granularity of the potential depends on the evolutionary stage .",
    "the amplitude of brownian motion of the binary , while larger than for a single sbh of the same mass @xcite , scales roughly as @xmath246 , and in real galaxies would be smaller than the size of the loss cone for most part of the evolution . using somewhat different arguments , @xcite estimated the timescale of loss - cone refilling by brownian motion and concluded that this effect is unlikely to substantially affect the evolution .",
    "consider next the case of non - spherical galaxies , which seem to offer a more promising way to solve the final - parsec problem via collisionless dynamics .",
    "@xcite estimated draining rates for the loss regions in axisymmetric and triaxial galaxies , using arguments similar to those in our section  [ sec : evol_longterm_theory ] .",
    "@xcite concluded that the loss region in triaxial galaxies is not likely to be depleted if the flattening parameter , responsible for the fraction of centrophilic orbits , is @xmath247 , although the plots in which she showed evolution timescales demonstrate the effect of gradual depletion of the loss region only for the case of small flattening . for axisymmetric systems",
    ", @xcite estimated that the loss region ( or  loss wedge  , in the terminology of * ? ? ? * ) can be depleted rather quickly in many cases , and the relaxation - limited evolution timescales are still longer than the hubble time .",
    "thus our conclusions qualitatively agree with that study .",
    "@xcite considered self - consistent triaxial models of galactic nuclei with sbhs which had a significant fraction of centrophilic orbits . they solved the evolutionary equations similar to ( [ eq : hardening_rate_xi],[eq : depletion_triax ] ) , and found that the hardening rate is nearly independent of time , but scales with the square of the fraction of chaotic orbits .",
    "analysis of the data plotted in their figure  6 suggests that @xmath248 , more in line with our findings in the present study and in .",
    "for the case of a singular isothermal cusp ( @xmath53 ) , equation  ( [ eq : hardening_rate_asympt_triax ] ) suggests that the asymptotic hardening rate scales as the squared fraction of chaotic orbits @xmath111 , in agreement with their results .",
    "their equation  55 implies a hardening rate @xmath249 , and our monte carlo simulation of a @xmath53 dehnen model has on average a similar hardening rate with @xmath250 , even though it declines with time .",
    "thus the basic conclusion of that paper , that even a moderate amount of triaxiality is sufficient to drive the binary to coalescence in less than a hubble time , is corroborated by our simulations and asymptotic analysis , even though some details differ ( most importantly , their neglect of the slowdown of the hardening rate ) .",
    "most other studies to date have assumed or inferred that the loss cone must be kept nearly full in non - spherical systems , using various arguments .",
    "@xcite explored the properties of orbits in a triaxial galaxy with a central sbh .",
    "they estimated that the time required to change the angular momenta of particles due to collisionless torques was much shorter than the hubble time , and concluded that the loss cone must remain full .",
    "however , this argument does not take into account the draining of the loss region , and they did not analyze the evolution of their model under this process .",
    "more recently , @xcite performed a similar analysis for a nearly axisymmetric model , which in fact was slightly triaxial in the central part .",
    "they computed the mass of stars belonging to orbits that are able to come into the loss cone with a size corresponding to the initial stage of binary evolution , which was several times larger than @xmath104 . from this",
    "they concluded that the loss cone should remain well populated during the subsequent evolution , but their estimate did not take into account that the volume of the loss region also shrinks along with the binary semimajor axis in the axisymmetric case .",
    "it is unclear whether the slight triaxiality of their model would be sufficient to support enough truly centrophilic orbits during the entire evolution .",
    "@xcite considered a hybrid model for binary evolution , based on the hardening and eccentricity growth rates computed from scattering experiments .",
    "he assumed that after the initial phase of formation of a hard binary , accompanied by the erosion of the stellar cusp at @xmath251 , the subsequent evolution occurs in the full - loss - cone regime , i.e.  the hardening rate is given by @xmath252 ( equation [ eq : s_uniform ] ) with density and velocity dispersion computed at @xmath18 .",
    "thus his evolutionary tracks are similar to our calculations in section  [ sec : coalescence ] with parameters @xmath253 ( the loss cone is full ) and @xmath179 ( the hardening rate does not decrease with time ) . as figure  [ fig : t_coal ] and equation  ( [ eq : t_coal_approx ] ) show , in this case the coalescence time is shortened by a factor of few with respect to the more conservative assumptions proposed in our study .",
    "more recently , @xcite compared the evolutionary tracks from the hybrid model of @xcite with those obtained by @xmath0-body simulations of mergers @xcite .",
    "they found reasonable agreement for the eccentricity evolution and hardening rate , even though the latter was somewhat lower and declined with time in @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "they ascribed this to the gradual decrease of the density and corresponding increase of @xmath18 . as we have argued in section  [ sec : evol_longterm_theory ] , the decline of hardening rate is mostly caused by the depletion of centrophilic orbits at all radii , rather than simply the decrease of density at the influence radius .",
    "for instance , in our collisionless simulations of isolated models with @xmath254 , the actual hardening rate dropped by a factor of 5 ( 10 ) by the end of simulations , while the density at @xmath18 , and correspondingly the full - loss - cone hardening rate @xmath21 , decreased by less than 30% .",
    "the coalescence times quoted in @xcite are longer than ours due to a different @xmath255 relation adopted in that paper .",
    "we stress , however , that their estimates are based on the hardening rates from collisional @xmath0-body simulations , while coalescence times for collisionless systems , advocated in the present study , are up to a few times longer for the same galaxy parameters .",
    "studies based on @xmath0-body simulations have generally observed little or no dependence of the hardening rate on @xmath0 in non - spherical galaxy models that were formed via mergers @xcite or created as isolated models @xcite .",
    "this result has been interpreted as an indication that the loss cone remains nearly full , although @xcite reported that the hardening rate was gradually decreasing with time , suggesting that the reservoir of centrophilic orbits was being depopulated .",
    "a similar trend can be seen in other merger simulations ( e.g.  @xcite , fig.1 , or @xcite , fig.2 ) ; in the latter paper , the models with steeper cusps displayed a systematically more rapid decline of hardening rate with time .",
    "all these trends are in agreement with our findings , even though the previous studies did not highlight them .",
    "we note , however , that in our simulations the hardening rate always turns out to be substantially lower than @xmath21 for large enough @xmath0 .",
    "this might seem to be in contrast with other studies that report a hardening rate comparable to @xmath21 for non - spherical systems .",
    "however , a more detailed examination suggests that the apparent discrepancy can be attributed to different definitions of the full - loss - cone rate , and to different normalizations of the stellar density profile .",
    "for instance , in @xcite and @xcite the flattened models were created by adiabatic squeezing of the original density profile , and hence their scale radii are roughly a factor of two smaller than ours , as can be seen in figure  1 of the latter paper . from equation  ( [ eq : s_infl ] ) , it is apparent that this translates to a hardening rate @xmath256 times higher than ours .",
    "we have re - simulated their models with our @xmath0-body code and found generally good agreement with their results .",
    "most importantly , as we have argued in and this study , the hardening rates in @xmath0-body simulations are dominated by , or at least have a significant contribution from , collisional effects even for @xmath257 , thus it is not easy to extrapolate these results to real galaxies . using the monte carlo method , we were able to reach the collisionless regime , which turned out to be very different for axisymmetric and triaxial galaxies , while in @xmath0-body simulations of they looked nearly the same .",
    "it is also instructive to compare loss - cone theory in the single and binary sbh cases .",
    "the first obvious difference is the much larger size of the loss cone in the case of a binary . as a consequence",
    ", the relaxation - driven repopulation of the loss cone almost always occurs in the empty - loss - cone regime ; on the other hand , collisionless changes in angular momentum due to non - spherical torques occur on the same dynamical timescale as the depletion of the loss cone , so that it always remains partially populated in non - spherical systems .",
    "a second important factor is that the size of the loss cone decreases as the binary shrinks , while in the case of a single sbh it can only grow .",
    "third , the mass of stars needed to be delivered into the loss cone of the binary is a few times larger than the mass of ( the lighter component of ) the binary , while for single sbhs the accreted mass in stars is typically small compared to the sbh mass .",
    "these three factors explain the fundamental difference between collisionless spherical and axisymmetric systems , on the one hand , and triaxial ones , on the other hand . for the latter ones ,",
    "the evolution is almost entirely driven by draining of centrophilic orbits , whose total mass is much larger than @xmath58 and furthermore does not depend on the size of the loss cone .",
    "interestingly , in the case of a single sbh most of captured stars arrive from regular pyramid orbits inside @xmath18 , while in the case of the binary the loss region consists mainly of chaotic orbits outside @xmath18 ; this explains the slightly different time dependence of the draining rates . in the axisymmetric case ,",
    "the volume of the loss region composed of chaotic orbits that can be delivered into the loss cone by collisionless torques , shrinks along with the binary semimajor axis , and its orbit population is nearly depleted before the binary reaches the gw - dominated regime .",
    "the subsequent evolution is determined by the rate at which this loss region is repopulated by relaxation . since the volume of this region is still much larger than the volume of the loss cone proper , it is more easily repopulated in axisymmetric than in spherical systems .",
    "the same is true for single sbhs ; the fact that for them the difference between axisymmetric and triaxial systems is much less than between spherical and axisymmetric ones ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  4 ) stems largely from the adopted isotropic ( non - depleted ) initial conditions for the relaxation . on the other hand , in the case of a massive binary the phase space",
    "is already depleted out to much larger values of angular momentum than the current loss cone boundary , thus it takes longer for the relaxation to resupply the loss region .    in short , loss cone theory in",
    "non - spherical systems is a delicate interplay between collisional and collisionless effects , and the outcome depends on the evolutionary history of the loss cone , as well as the changes in the global structure of the system ( its shape and phase - space gradients ) . only using a combination of various approaches ",
    "@xmath0-body simulations , orbit analysis , monte carlo methods and scaling arguments  can one hope to understand the behavior of realistic stellar systems .      the evolution of binary sbhs in gas - poor galaxies is determined by the rate of slingshot interactions with stars in the loss cone  the low - angular - momentum region of the phase space .",
    "the fact that the loss cone is quickly depleted in idealized spherical systems gave rise to the final - parsec problem .",
    "repopulation of the loss cone occurs both due to collisional and collisionless effects ; the latter are only relevant in non - spherical systems .",
    "we have developed a monte carlo method that can efficiently deal with both collisionless and collisional evolution , and used it to show that in the collisionless limit , the repopulation is efficient if the galaxy is even slightly triaxial . to the extent that mergers result in galactic shapes that are not exactly axisymmetric ,",
    "our results imply that the final - parsec problem does not exist in most galaxies .",
