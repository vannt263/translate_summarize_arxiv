    "in disordered media the scattering mean free path ( notation @xmath0 ) denotes the characteristic distance that waves need to travel to achieve a random phase @xcite .",
    "the length @xmath0 sets the scale in all aspects of multiple scattering.mesoscopic \" samples have sizes larger than @xmath0 and smaller than the decoherence length , beyond which the phase is irreversibly destroyed , by either coupling to environment ( quantum ) or due to background noise ( classical ) . a third fundamental length",
    ", the transport mean free path ( notation @xmath1 ) , determines the randomization of the direction of propagation .",
    "it is closely related to @xmath0 but the physics is subtly different : whereas @xmath0 is determined by superposition , @xmath1 is also sensitive to interference .    despite its conceptual importance , @xmath0 is rather unaccessible .",
    "theoreticians have found it hard to calculate for dense media because infinitely many  feynman diagrams \" contribute@xcite , and choices have usually been guided by effective medium arguments @xcite . in experiments",
    "it is mostly @xmath1 that appears in observables associated with energy transport @xcite . to get @xmath0",
    "directly we must measure the ` coherent ' _ field _",
    "@xmath2 , either for different sample thicknesses or for different times .",
    "this requires a coherent source , phase sensitive detection of an exponentially small signal , and a good ensemble average .",
    "today , these requirements can be met for ultrasound @xcite and electromagnetic waves @xcite .",
    "a final complication is that coherent beam experiments always measure the combination of phase randomization and absorption , quantified by the _ extinction _ length @xmath3 . here",
    ", we investigate the possibility to retrieve the scattering mean free path of a random medium from the spatial phase statistics of the scattered waves , rather than from the coherent field .",
    "the phase of a diffuse field can be measured using a  passive \" source , whose coherence , position and magnitude are of no relevance , provided it delivers diffuse energy well in excess of the background noise .",
    "first we introduce the field correlation function in random media and discuss the role of small absorption .",
    "secondly we discuss the basic results related to phase statistics and give a rapid theoretical support .",
    "we finally discuss the relation to topological charge , whose variance has been studied extensively in literature .",
    "in a multiply scattering medium far from the localization threshold , it is widely accepted that the complex field obeys circular gaussian statistics @xcite .",
    "since the average field @xmath4 vanishes if the source is far away , the only parameter governing the wave statistics is the two - point correlation function @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we consider a heterogeneous medium in either 2d or 3d , in which all waves suffer from the same small absorption rate @xmath6 in energy ( absorption length @xmath7).we assume the medium to be large enough to ignore the boundaries .",
    "we consider a wave field @xmath8 released by a source with spectral density @xmath9 .",
    "the subscript @xmath10 refers to a band - filtering in some frequency band @xmath11 in which diffusion constant @xmath12 and absorption time @xmath13 are constant ( @xmath14 is imposed to resolve the dynamics ) .",
    "its ( ensemble - averaged ) spatial correlation at any lapse time @xmath15 in the coda takes the following diffuse form @xcite ,    @xmath16    this formula shows that , once absorption has been acknowledged by the factor @xmath17 , the field correlation function is proportional to ( the imaginary part of ) the _ absorption - free _ green function .",
    "this is best understood in the frequency domain , where eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) gives rise to the following product of exponentials @xmath18 \\times \\exp[i(\\omega+ i/2\\tau_a)(t+\\tau/2)]^ * = \\exp(-i\\omega\\tau)\\exp(-t/\\tau_a),\\ ] ] from which infer that the absorption only appears as a function of the lapse time @xmath15 , and not of the local correlation time @xmath19 .",
    "a first observation is thus that in the diffuse time - tail , we can consider the ( normalized ) spatial correlation of the field to be free of absorption .    in this work",
    "we shall ignore the effects of source spectrum and finite bandwidth , which can both straightforwardly be included into gaussian statistics @xcite .",
    "if we denote by @xmath20 the spatial field correlation function at frequency @xmath21 @xcite , in the vicinity of some point @xmath22 , deep in the coda at time @xmath15 , and normalized to @xmath23 , we find it to be solely dependent on the local green s function , a central issue in recent attempts to image passively @xcite .",
    "contrary to chaotic media , the @xmath20 of random media always decays exponentially due to dephasing from scattering . in 3d",
    "is @xmath24 , whereas in 2d @xmath25 @xcite , with @xmath26 the wave number .",
    "the damped oscillations on the scale of the wavelength @xmath27 originate from a superposition of plane waves incident with arbitrary directions but with equal amplitude .",
    "it prevents us from seeing the genuine dephasing that occurs on the _ much _ longer scale of the scattering mean free path .",
    "rather than the field correlation , we propose here to consider the spatial phase correlation @xmath28 . the phase @xmath29 is defined as the complex phase of the wave function @xmath30 . at any point @xmath31 the phase is a flat random number between @xmath32 and @xmath33 . upon moving to another point",
    "@xmath34 it will exhibit discontinuous jumps of @xmath35 between @xmath36 .",
    "an occasional jump of a @xmath33 could occur when a singularity with either positive or negative topological charge @xcite is crossed , but such event has zero probability on a 1d line .",
    "let us now  unwrap \" the phase , i.e correct by hand for the @xmath35 discontinuities as was done in the frequency domain @xcite and in the time domain @xcite , to get the _ unwrapped phase _ or cumulative phase @xmath37 that varies continuously with @xmath31 , and which in principle can take all values @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "this continuation is _ not _ topologically invariant , but depends on the exact path chosen to go from @xmath22 to @xmath39 .",
    "gaussian statistics demonstrate that both the distribution @xmath40 , and the spatial correlation function @xmath41 of the phase derivative @xmath42 are smooth , confirming that phase jumps do not affect phase statistics within an infinitesimal increment @xmath43 .",
    "so the integral of @xmath42 along the path should - statistically speaking - be equal to the continuous cumulative phase . if we agree to walk straight along the _ _",

    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ cphase ] ) that , @xmath47    the phase derivative correlation function @xmath48 can be calculated from the joint probability function of 4 complex fields at 4 different positions , which involves both @xmath20 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "already for @xmath53 , c is small enough to approximate @xmath54 by its asymptotic limit , and we find @xmath55 = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{c }      ( { k}/{\\pi x } ) \\exp(-x/\\ell)\\ \\   \\ ( 2d ) \\\\ ( { 1}/{2x^2 } ) \\exp(-x/\\ell)\\ \\ \\ ( 3d ) \\\\",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that , contrary to the field correlation @xmath56 , @xmath57 exhibits no oscillations on the scale of the wavelength .",
    "equation  ( [ dasym ] ) shows that the mean free path @xmath0 assures convergence of eq .",
    "( [ cphase ] ) in both dimensions , making @xmath0 the characteristic length scale in spatial phase correlation . in fig .",
    "1 we plot @xmath58 as a function of @xmath59 for 2d . for all values of @xmath60",
    "it follows a universal exponential decay towards the asymptotic value @xmath61 . in 3d",
    "the asymptotic value varies only logarithmically with @xmath60 in 3d ( fig .",
    "2 ) and two characteristic length scales appear , @xmath27 and @xmath0 . a measurement of @xmath58 would thus give us direct access to @xmath60 and @xmath0 in both cases .    the same study has been performed for the phase variance .",
    "we infer from eq .",
    "( [ cumvar ] ) that the parameter @xmath62 is less sensitive to large values for @xmath63 than the correlation @xmath58 . in 2d random media ( fig .",
    "3 ) , its plateau value @xmath64 ( the  phase diffusion constant \" ) depends logarithmically on @xmath60 , although the diffuse plateau is still reached after typically one mean free path . in 3d ( dashed line in fig .",
    "4 ) we see that after an approximate linear rise , @xmath62 converges already after a few wavelengths to the asymptote @xmath65 , independent of @xmath60 .",
    "we conclude that the cumulative phase correlation is sensitive to the mean free path in both 2d and 3d , unlike the phase variance which depends on @xmath0 only in 2d .",
    "it was realized recently by wilkinson @xcite that the spatial phase correlation function is a key element in a old discussion on the statistics of topological charge of gaussian field inside a closed contour .",
    "this discussion goes back to halperin @xcite and nye and berry @xcite , with significant contributions later by berry and dennis@xcite , and freund and wilkinson @xcite .",
    "the zero s of a complex function in @xmath66 dimensions are located on @xmath67  nodal \" hypersurfaces , nodal lines in 3d and nodal points in 2d .",
    "the topological charge @xmath68 enclosed by a 2d surface is defined as the number of nodal points weighed by their topological sign .",
    "this number is determined by the order of the vortex surrounding the nodal point @xcite . for complex gaussian random fields topological charges different from @xmath69 are highly improbable @xcite .",
    "the following relation holds ,    @xmath70    with @xmath71 the line contour enclosing the surface .",
    "this relation is reminiscent of the quantized rotation of superfluids , and is deeply related to the rouch theorem in complex analysis .",
    "its validity can be understood by applying stokes theorem to the function @xmath72 , whose imaginary part has been analytically continued along the contour .",
    "equation  ( [ topo ] ) facilitates a study of the statistics of the topological charge @xmath68 . in the diffuse regime",
    "the phase gradient in any direction vanishes on average , so @xmath73 .",
    "following wilkinson @xcite we will relate the variance of @xmath68 to the correlation of the phase derivative .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath74 measures the length along a circular contour with radius @xmath75 we find , @xmath76 the phase derivative correlation @xmath77 is , _ mutadis - mutandis _ , given by eq .",
    "( [ deri ] ) ( with @xmath78 and @xmath79 $ ] )",
    ". one basic feature of @xmath80 is already known .",
    "if we would assume all nodal points @xmath81 to have random charges @xmath82 , _ independent _ of each other , we would find @xmath83 , i.e. proportional to the surface .",
    "actually , they are not independent but tend to be perfectly screened @xcite , which affects the quadratic law",
    ". we shall define the screening length @xmath84 as the typical length beyond which the asymptotic form of the charge variance is reached .",
    "wilkinson and freund report a linear ,  diffuse \" asymptotic form @xcite , @xmath85 we have verified that eq .",
    "( [ circle ] ) is consistent with this diffusion law , with the same phase diffusion constant obtained earlier for the phase accumulated along a straight line ( fig .  3 and 4 ) .",
    "berry and dennis @xcite calculate @xmath80 from the topological charge correlation function , which is , due to screening , sensitive to  edge effects \" .",
    "when the charge distribution is smoothed with the gaussian @xmath86 ( with smoothed surface @xmath87 ) , the quadratic law valid for small @xmath88 turns over into the asymptote , @xmath89 provided the integral converges . in figs . 4 and 5 we have calculated @xmath90 for a disk in 2d and 3d random media . for small @xmath91",
    "we see that @xmath92 for both dimensions . in 3d @xmath90 at large @xmath75 depends very weakly on the mean free path @xmath0 since the integral in eq .",
    "( [ qfreund ] ) converges even for @xmath93 . for the field correlation @xmath94 @xcite",
    "the curve is very similar though with a somewhat smaller phase diffusion constant . in both cases",
    "this yields a screening length proportional to the wavelength . for 2d random media we can see that @xmath90 depends logarithmically on @xmath60 .",
    "the topological screening length now depends on the mean free path .",
    "the variance of _ smoothed _",
    "charge @xmath95 however ( fig .  6 ) , converges to @xmath96 in 2d and to @xmath97 in 3d , with a screening length typically equal to the @xmath0 .",
    "note that in 2d chaotic media , for which @xmath98 , the integrals  ( [ qfreund ] ) and ( [ qberry ] ) would diverge and the topological charge variance would actually increase as @xmath99 , i.e. is slightly superdiffuse , whereas its smoothed version @xmath100 no longer reaches a constant but becomes diffuse : @xmath101 .",
    "we have shown that in the late coda of waves propagating in 2d and 3d random media , the scattering mean free path governs the spatial fluctuations of both the phase derivative @xmath42 , cumulative phase and the topological charge , measured inside a surface of size @xmath102 .",
    "screening makes topological charge fluctuations grow slower than @xmath102 .",
    "the screening length is defined as the typical length beyond which they reach their final behavior . in 2d",
    "it is proportional to the mean free path , in 3d to the wavelength .",
    "if the charge is smoothed with a gaussian the screening length is typically equal to the mean free path , in both dimensions .",
    "this highlights the subtle role of smoothing screened charge .",
    "the spatial correlation of @xmath42 , whose measurement requires only four phase - sensitive detectors , decays exponentially with the scattering mean free path @xmath0 as the sole length scale .",
    "in seismic measurements , often dominated by 2d rayleigh waves , this may be a novel opportunity to measure the scattering mean free path of surface waves",
    ". such measurement would not be sensitive to absorption , neither to the precise source location , quite opposed to a measurement of the coherent beam .",
    "one can show that @xmath103 and @xmath104 with @xmath105 the transport velocity , inconsistent with the exponential decay proposed for @xmath20 , thus only correct for large @xmath63 . in this work",
    "we exclude the exponential factor for @xmath106 , and also ignore phase accumulation inside the scatterers , which is the reason why @xmath105 should appear ."
