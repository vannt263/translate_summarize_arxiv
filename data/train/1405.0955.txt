    "oscillators represent one of the main conceptual and technical tools in physics . at a quantum level , oscillators capture , e.g. , the physics of light trapped in a cavity , the nature of molecule bonding , and the behavior of optomechanical oscillators , cantilevers or springs . as a matter of fact ,",
    "any bounded quantum system may be always described as a quantum harmonic oscillator ( qho ) after a suitable approximation . at the same time , nonlinear features are relevant in many fields of physics and they can be exploited for several applications @xcite . as for example , nonlinearity has been recently exploited in optomechanical systems to generate single - photon states and more general non - gaussian states @xcite .",
    "nonlinear oscillators attracted attention also from a purely mathematical point of view , and may have potential applications in different areas also outside physical sciences .    quantum technology in continuous - variable systems has been initially developed with gaussian states @xcite .",
    "more recently , however , the use of non - gaussian states and operations @xcite has emerged as a resource for enhancing several processes , as entanglement distillation @xcite , quantum estimation @xcite , and quantum error correction @xcite . in this framework , nonlinear oscillators may be useful since their ground states ( gss ) , as well as states at thermal equilibrium , are necessarily non - gaussian . in the realm of discrete variables ,",
    "nonlinear oscillators allow to engineer effective two - level systems , due to their varying spacing of its energy levels in contrast to uniform ( harmonic ) spacing .",
    "in fact , strategies to generate entanglement with these effective qubits have been already proposed @xcite .",
    "the above arguments suggest that nonlinearity may represent a resource for quantum information and control . in order to investigate whether this is indeed the case",
    ", one needs to quantify the degree of nonlinearity of a given system , i.e. to introduce a measure for the nonlinear character of a quantum oscillator . on a more fundamental perspective",
    ", it would be of interest to have a measure of quantum nonlinearity in order to investigate quantitatively the connection between the rate of decoherence of an open quantum system and the anharmonic features of the potential @xcite .",
    "`` what is the nonlinearity of an oscillator ? '' is a seemingly simple question , which however is not immediate to address in the quantum case and , in turn , did not receive a general answer so far .",
    "our approach to the problem is to focus on the properties of the oscillators ground state rather than on the specific features of the potential itself .",
    "indeed , it would be desirable to define a measure that assesses the physical effects of the nonlinearity , rather than the dependence on the parameters that appear in the expression of the potentials .",
    "in addition , the potential functions are , in general , not integrable functions on the real axis and this , loosely speaking , prevents any attempt to introduce a nonlinearity measure based on any distance function between potentials .",
    "we thus shift our attention from the potential to the ground state associated to that potential and compare their properties to the ground state of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "in particular , we focus on the gaussian character of the harmonic oscillator gs and introduce a nonlinearity measure based on the non - gaussianity of the gs .",
    "we analyze in some detail the properties of this measure and compare its behavior with that of another possible choice , i.e. the bures distance between the potential s gs and its qho counterpart . although the bures - based nonlinearity measure @xmath0 $ ] somehow represents a `` natural '' choice , it requires the introduction of a reference harmonic oscillator , i.e. the knowledge of the potential function at least in the vicinity of its minimum . on the contrary",
    ", the non - gaussianity - based ( ng - based ) measure @xmath1 $ ] only requires the knowledge of the gs , and thus it may represent a more convenient choice for experimental applications .",
    "as we will see , the two measures are monotone functions of each other in most cases , and this suggests that the ng - based measure is a convenient choice to capture the anharmonic nature of quantum oscillators and to quantify their nonlinearity in a robust way , e. g. , independently on the specific features of the potential . in addition , we will also provide examples of potentials where the bures measure can not be defined , due to the lack of a proper reference harmonic potential , while the ng - based measure properly quantifies their nonlinear features .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows : in the next section we review few facts about quantum harmonic oscillators , in order to establish notation , and introduce the two nonlinearity measures , also discussing their general properties . in section [ s : pots ] we present results for a choice of significant nonlinear potentials and discuss their implications .",
    "section [ s : out ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",

    "the hamiltonian of the qho describes its energy , and is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the momentum and position operators .",
    "one can introduce the ladder operators , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , for which @xmath9 = \\mathbb{i}$ ] , so that the hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath10 , with @xmath11 representing the number operator .",
    "the energy spectrum is given by @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",

    "this is a quite natural choice for the reference oscillator .",
    "however , depending on the potential under investigation , the determination of this frequency may be problematic or even misleading .",
    "this issue leads us to introduce a different measure , @xmath32 $ ] , which does not depend on the choice of a reference potential .",
    "in fact , given a potential @xmath33 , an alternative definition for a nonlinearity measure @xmath34 $ ] , may be given in terms of the non - gaussianity of the corresponding gs , i.e. @xmath35=\\delta_\\sg \\left[| 0\\rangle_\\sv { } _ \\sv",

    "this further supports the view of the qre as a distance - like quantity between quantum states in the hilbert space . among its properties , we mention that the qre is invariant under unitary operations and not - increasing under generic quantum maps . the qre - based measure of ng is defined as @xcite @xmath44=s\\left(\\rho ||\\tau_\\ssg\\right ) \\label{eq : qreng}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the reference gaussian state of @xmath18 , i.e. a gaussian state with the same covariance matrix of the state @xmath18 ( see appendix [ apb ] ) .",

    "the crucial point here is that the definition of @xmath52 requires the determination of a _ reference gaussian state _ for the gs of @xmath24 rather than a _ reference harmonic potential _ for @xmath24 itself .",
    "therefore , whereas the calculation of @xmath53 requires the knowledge of the behavior of the potential near its minimum , the nonlinearity measure @xmath52 is independent on the specific features of the potential .",
    "this property is particularly relevant for possible experimental applications of these measures : the gs wavefunction of a given nonlinear potential can be indeed tomographically estimated @xcite and , as a consequence , the measure @xmath52 can be directly evaluated without any _ a priori _ information on the potential . in addition",
    "the measure @xmath52 inherits an important property from the non - gaussianity measure @xmath54 , which helps in justifying its use for quantifying nonlinearity from a more mathematical and fundamental point of view . as it is proved in @xcite",
    ", @xmath54 is invariant under symplectic transformations , i.e. transformation induced by any hamiltonian which is quadratic or linear in the field operators ( or in the canonical coordinates ) .",
    "it is clear then that its property induces an expected and more than reasonable hierarchy between hamiltonians by means of the measure @xmath52 , assigning the same amount of nonlinearity for all the hamiltonians which are related by a symplectic transformation , e.g. oscillators that are simply displaced one from each other , rotated in phase - space , or even squeezed .      before presenting some examples illustrating the behavior of @xmath52 and @xmath53 for specific nonlinear potentials ,",
    "let us describe some general properties of the nonlinearity measures we have just introduced .",
    "both measures are zero for a harmonic potential , whereas they may lead to a different definition of maximally nonlinear potential .",
    "the bures - based nonlinearity is a bounded function , @xmath55 .",
    "the maximum is achieved for potentials which have a gs orthogonal to that of the corresponding harmonic oscillator , e.g. , fock number states or any other state residing in the subspace orthogonal to the `` harmonic vacuum '' . on the other hand",
    ", the ng - based nonlinearity @xmath56 is an unbounded function",
    ". a renormalized quantity in @xmath57 $ ] may be obtained at any fixed value of energy upon normalizing @xmath52 to the non - gaussianity of the maximally non - gaussian state at that value of the energy , e.g. , fock number states .",
    "the maximum is thus achieved for a potential which has a gs equal to a fock state of the harmonic oscillator or to some specific superpositions of them @xcite .    in order to gain some more insight into the properties of the two measures",
    "let us consider a one - dimensional oscillatory system , whose harmonic behavior is perturbed by an anharmonic term in the potential , i.e. @xmath58 according to standard perturbation theory for static hamiltonians the ground state of the system may be approximated by @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "we retained the first two terms in the perturbation expansion in order to describe situations where we have some symmetries in the potential . indeed , since the harmonic ground state has an even wavefunction , an even anharmonic perturbation @xmath63 would lead to @xmath64 , whereas for an odd one we would have @xmath65 ( of course , a purely odd perturbation is not allowed , since it would make the whole hamiltonian unbounded from below ) . upon expanding the perturbing potential to the fourth order , i.e. @xmath66",

    "quantum oscillators with nonlinear behavior induced by anharmonic potentials have attracted interest in different fields , as they play a relevant role for fundamental and practical purposes . in particular , they have recently received attention as a possible resource for quantum technology and information processing . as a consequence , it would be useful to have a suitable measures of nonlinearity to better characterize these potentials and to better assess their performances in those fields . in this paper",
    ", we have addressed the quantification of nonlinearity for quantum oscillators , and have introduced two measures of nonlinearity based on the properties of the ground state of the potential , rather than on the form of the potential itself .",
    "the first measure accounts for the bures distance between the potential gs and that of a reference harmonic potential .",
    "it is a natural choice for a measure of nonlinearity , however it requires the knowledge of the potential near its minimum .",
    "we have thus suggested a different measure , based on the non - gaussian properties of the potential gs , which may be calculated using only information about the gs itself .",
    "the two measures have been analyzed and compared , both in terms of their general properties and by evaluating them for some significant anharmonic potentials .",
    "our results show that the ng - based measure has some merits which makes it a good choice for the purpose of assessing nonlinearity .",
    "in fact , while it captures the nonlinear features of oscillators as the bures measures in most cases ( e.g. , for any anharmonic potential which is an even function at lowest orders ) it has a clear advantage from a computational and experimental point of view : it does not require the determination of a reference frequency and thus it does not need any _ a priori _ information on the corresponding potential to be calculated . the only ingredient needed to evaluate @xmath52 is the gs wavefunction , a task that can be pursued by tomographic reconstruction independently on the specific features of the potential .",
    "in addition , we have seen examples of potentials where the bures measure can not be defined , due to the lack of a proper reference harmonic potential , whereas the ng - based properly quantify the nonlinear features of the oscillator behavior . moreover , from a more fundamental point of view , the validity of the measure @xmath52 is strengthened by the fact that the same amount of non - linearity is assigned to non - linear hamiltonians which are related by symplectic transformation in phase - space ( displacement , phase - rotation and squeezing ) , inducing a reasonable and expected hierarchy .",
    "overall , we have addressed the general issue of assessing the nonlinearity of a quantum potential , highlighted the current limits , and nevertheless individuated a consistent method to quantify the nonlinearity based on non - gaussianity of the potential s ground state . in order to fully validate the measure(s ) here",
    "proposed we would have needed an already established way to compare nonlinear potentials and assess their diversity .",
    "then we could have tried to prove some form of continuity of our measure(s ) with respect this quantity .not having a measure or a set of criteria of this kind is among the motivations of our work while being able to summarize the nonlinear character by a single quantity is the main result .    finally , we notice that our results could be exploited in any experiments , e.g. , on quantum control , where either by technological of fundamental issues , information on the confining potential in inaccessible or limited .",
    "our approach may be generalized and refined by taking into account the non - gaussian features of the gibbs thermal states of the nonlinear oscillators , rather than the sole gs .",
