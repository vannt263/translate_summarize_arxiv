    "in recent years wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) models @xcite have received considerable attention since most known examples of conformal field theory can be undestood through them ( e.g the minimal models @xcite ) .",
    "in particular the su(2 ) wzw model has been examined often because it is the simplest example of non - abelian model , as well as because for level @xmath1 it provides examples of unitary conformal field theories with central charge @xmath2 ( for su(2 ) wzw model , c=3k/(k+2 ) ) .",
    "it is therefore important to understand this model well at any integer level k.    the level k su(2 ) wzw model is directly linked to the level k @xmath3 kac - moody algebra , since the second is simply the algebra of the modes of the conserved currents of the model for each chirality .",
    "in fact the physisists hilbert space of this model , is a direct sum of a finite number of irreducible @xmath3 kac - moody modules for each chiral sector , indexed by their spin which takes values from 0 to k/2 , as specified by the selection rules .",
    "here we are going to denote these modules by @xmath4 .",
    "the su(2 ) wzw model , like any other wzw model , can be formulated on a riemann surface of arbitrary genus .",
    "the simplest case of the sphere is well understood @xcite,@xcite .",
    "here we are going to be concerned with the case of the torus .",
    "of particular interest to us is going to be the space of the two - point spin1/2-spin1/2 blocks on the torus .",
    "this space is generated by the following basis elements : @xmath5 @xmath6 here @xmath7 are the chiral primary fields @xcite , @xmath8 is the diagonal virasoro algebra generator , in our case determined from the current modes through the sugawara construction , and @xmath9 .",
    "z takes values on the parallelogram with sides 1 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "these basis elements for the above space of blocks can be calculated via the use of a free field representation @xcite,@xcite . for our basis elements",
    "this calculation has been carried out explicitely in @xcite .",
    "@xmath12 is given by the following integral @xmath13 while @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is a theta function with characteristics @xcite , and @xmath16 is the prime form on the torus . here",
    "@xmath17 is the first jacobi theta function and @xmath18 is the jacobi eta function .",
    "our vector space of blocks forms the fiber of a flat holomorphic vector bundle over the punctured torus with respect to the knizhnik - zamolodchikov connection .",
    "in fact our basis is a horizondal section of this vector bundle .",
    "so there are monodromy matrices associated to analytic continuation of our basis elements around non - contractible cycles a and b , and we will denote them by a , b respectively ( here the constant in front of the blocks is taken to be 1 ) .",
    "there is also a matrix @xmath19 associated to analytic continuation from z to -z .",
    "since the blocks are translation invariant , analytically continuing from z to -z is the same as interchanging the origin with z , so this is really a braiding matrix .",
    "this braiding matrix was originally obtained in @xcite through a calculation on the sphere .",
    "together with a , b they form a translation invariant representation of the braid group of two strings on the torus @xcite .",
    "but the space of conformal blocks only depends on the complex structure of the torus so the blocks transform covariantly under appropriate lifts of the sl(2,z ) transformations on the unpunctured torus , on the mapping class group of the two punctured torus .",
    "the action of these lifts , denoted s and t respectively , on the space of our conformal blocks , is determined here . in this way",
    "an infinite set of representations of the mapping class group of the two punctured torus is obtained .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : first the structure of the 1 forms that are used to obtain the blocks is examined and the identities satisfied by the various integrals of these forms are written down .",
    "the selection rules for the two point blocks follow from these identities .",
    "then these identities are used to obtain the s matrix , corresponding to @xmath20 .",
    "after that a presentation of the mapping class group is obtained by making use of its action on the fundamental group of the two punctured torus as outer automorphisms .",
    "then a set of identities satisfied by the computed matrices is obtained through analytic continuation .",
    "these identities are checked for level 1,2,3 and they are satisfied by the computed matrices .",
    "finally it is shown that the computed matrices form a particular class of representations of the mapping class group of the two punctured torus .",
    "the forms of interest here are the following : @xmath21 this is defined on an appropriately cut universal cover of the torus . here",
    "the cuts are chosen as follows :    ( 105,100 )    ( 0,0 )    ( 35,30 ) ( 0,0)(1,4)5 ( 0,0)(1,0)30 ( 30,0)(1,4)5 ( 5,20)(1,0)30 ( 10,10 ) ( 10,10)(-2,-2)5(0,-1)1 ( 8,8)(-2,-2)5(0,1)1 ( 8,9)(-2,-2)5(1,0)2 ( 5,20)(1,-2)5(0,-1)2 ( 5,18)(1,-2)5(1,0)1 ( 8,12)-z-@xmath10 - 1    ( 30,0 )    ( 35,30 ) ( 0,0)(1,4)5 ( 0,0)(1,0)30 ( 30,0)(1,4)5 ( 5,20)(1,0)30 ( 10,10 ) ( 10,10)(-2,-2)5(0,-1)1 ( 8,8)(-2,-2)5(0,1)1 ( 8,9)(-2,-2)5(1,0)2 ( 5,20)(1,-2)5(0,-1)2 ( 5,18)(1,-2)5(1,0)1 ( 8,12)-z-@xmath10    ( 60,0 )    ( 35,30 ) ( 0,0)(1,4)5 ( 0,0)(1,0)30 ( 30,0)(1,4)5 ( 5,20)(1,0)30 ( 10,10 ) ( 10,10)(-2,-2)5(0,-1)1 ( 8,8)(-2,-2)5(0,1)1 ( 8,9)(-2,-2)5(1,0)2 ( 8,12)-z-@xmath10 + 1    ( 5,20 )    ( 35,30 ) ( 0,0)(1,4)5 ( 0,0)(1,0)30 ( 30,0)(1,4)5 ( 5,20)(1,0)30 ( 10,10 ) ( 10,10)(-2,-2)5(0,-1)1 ( 8,8)(-2,-2)5(0,1)1 ( 8,9)(-2,-2)5(1,0)2 ( 5,20)(1,-2)5(0,-1)2 ( 5,18)(1,-2)5(1,0)1 ( 8,12)-z-1    ( 35,20 )    ( 35,30 ) ( 0,0)(1,4)5 ( 0,0)(1,0)30 ( 30,0)(1,4)5 ( 5,20)(1,0)30 ( 10,10 ) ( 10,10)(-2,-2)5(0,-1)1 ( 8,8)(-2,-2)5(0,1)1 ( 8,9)(-2,-2)5(1,0)2 ( 8,12)-z    ( 65,20 )    ( 35,30 ) ( 0,0)(1,4)5 ( 0,0)(1,0)30 ( 30,0)(1,4)5 ( 5,20)(1,0)30 ( 10,10 ) ( 10,10)(-2,-2)5(0,-1)1 ( 8,8)(-2,-2)5(0,1)1 ( 8,9)(-2,-2)5(1,0)2 ( 5,20)(1,-2)5(0,-1)2 ( 5,18)(1,-2)5(1,0)1 ( 8,12)-z+1    ( 10,40 )    ( 35,30 ) ( 0,0)(1,4)5 ( 0,0)(1,0)30 ( 30,0)(1,4)5 ( 5,20)(1,0)30 ( 10,10 ) ( 10,10)(-2,-2)5(0,-1)1 ( 8,8)(-2,-2)5(0,1)1 ( 8,9)(-2,-2)5(1,0)2 ( 8,12)-z+@xmath10 - 1    ( 40,40 )    ( 35,30 ) ( 0,0)(1,4)5 ( 0,0)(1,0)30 ( 30,0)(1,4)5 ( 5,20)(1,0)30 ( 10,10 ) ( 10,10)(-2,-2)5(0,-1)1 ( 8,8)(-2,-2)5(0,1)1 ( 8,9)(-2,-2)5(1,0)2 ( 5,20)(1,-2)5(0,-1)2 ( 5,18)(1,-2)5(1,0)1 ( 8,12)-z+@xmath10    ( 70,40 )    ( 35,30 ) ( 0,0)(1,4)5 ( 0,0)(1,0)30 ( 30,0)(1,4)5 ( 5,20)(1,0)30 ( 10,10 ) ( 10,10)(-2,-2)5(0,-1)1 ( 8,8)(-2,-2)5(0,1)1 ( 8,9)(-2,-2)5(1,0)2 ( 5,20)(1,-2)5(0,-1)2 ( 5,18)(1,-2)5(1,0)1 ( 8,12)-z+@xmath10 + 1    here each line of cuts consists of @xmath22 segments    this cut plane has two automorphisms , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . this means that if we do this changes of variable then we do not separate any regions on the cut plane . hence we can derive the following identities :    the following identities hold : @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 .    *",

    "these identities show that we can express all integrals of our forms in terms of the integrals from 0 to 1 .",
    "in fact solving for the integrals from 0 to @xmath10 we get the following identity : @xmath42 where @xmath43 can not take the values 0 and 1 mod p.    the identities that we have imply also that @xmath44 for @xmath45 mod p. to see this take @xmath45 in ( 5 ) . this way we get : @xmath46 also equations ( 5 ) and ( 7 )",
    "imply that @xmath44 for @xmath47 mod p. the vanishing of these blocks is of course to be expected from the representation point of view because the intermediate state in our trace that defines the blocks can not have spin smaller than 0 or greater than k/2 .",
    "the conformal blocks that we have computed carry a representation of a lift of the mapping class group of the nonpunctured torus , that is sl(2,z ) , on the mapping class group of the two punctured torus .",
    "the action of this lift on the space of conformal blocks is generated by two elements .",
    "one that sends @xmath48 , the t element , and one that sends @xmath49 , the s element . for the second one one has to specify also the path of analytic continuation in the z - plane .",
    "this is going to be winding clockwise around the origin .",
    "the t matrix is easy to compute . letting @xmath50 in the trace formuli given for the blocks in the introduction",
    ", we get a phase factor appearing in front of each block .",
    "in particular @xmath51 which , using p = k+2 and n=2j+1 instead of k and j becomes : @xmath52 using also @xmath14 we get the same factor in front of @xmath53 .",
    "so if we choose as our basis @xmath54\\ ] ] the t matrix becomes : @xmath55    computing the s matrix is not so easy .",
    "here we need the integral representation of the blocks . letting the transformation defining the s matrix act on the block @xmath56 we have : @xmath57 here we have made use of the transformation property @xmath58 .",
    "the integration contour is :    ( 35,50 ) ( 0,20 )    ( 35,30 ) ( 0,0)(1,4)5 ( 0,0)(1,0)30 ( 30,0)(1,4)5 ( 5,20)(1,0)30 ( 5,-5 ) ( -5,-11)@xmath59 ( 15,0)(30,14)[b ]    doing now the transformation @xmath60 we get : @xmath61 here the integration contour is :    ( 30,30 ) ( 0,0)(1,4)50 ( 0,0)(1,0)300 ( 300,0)(1,4)50 ( 50,200)(1,0)300 ( 0,0 ) ( 1,1 ) 100 ( 120,100)(-1,2)50 ( 100,100)(-20,-20)5(0,-1)10 ( 80,80)(-20,-20)5(0,1)10 ( 80,90)(-20,-20)5(1,0)20 ( 120,100)-z ( 100,100 )    the theta function and the prime form satisfy the following transformation identities , which are based on poisson resummation : @xmath62 @xmath63    using now these identities together with the periodicity of the theta functions in @xmath64 with period 2p , we get the following expression : @xmath65 where c is the integration contour in the previous picture .",
    "now we can deform this contour to one that goes from 0 around -z back to 0 on the other side of the branch cut and then from there to @xmath10 . doing this",
    "we get : @xmath66 here the integral from 0 to -z is the one below the branch cut . putting this back in equation ( 14 )",
    "we get : @xmath67 where @xmath68 @xmath69    substituting in the expression for @xmath70 from identity ( 5 ) and in @xmath71 from ( 8) we get : @xmath72 @xmath73 putting these together we get : @xmath74 the factor @xmath75 cancells because the blocks are really densities in z of weight 3/2p and we have done the transformation @xmath76 .    now to describe the s matrix we need to introduce the matrix elements @xmath77 and the matrix k that has everywhere 0 s except at the positions ( 1,k+1 ) , ( 2,k ) , ( 3,k+2 ) , ( 4,k-1 ) , ( 5,k+3 ) , ( 6,k-2 ) up to ( 2k-1,2k ) , ( 2k,1 ) , where it has ones .",
    "this matrix is the transformation matrix from the basis @xmath78\\ ] ] to our original basis ( 9 ) . in terms of the basis ( 17 ) the s matrix becomes : @xmath79 where n and @xmath43 range from 1 to p-2 , so s is a 2p-4 by 2p-4 matrix . so the s matrix in terms of the basis ( 9 ) is @xmath80    also in terms of this basis the matrices @xmath81 corresponding to the transformations @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , where the analytic continuation for the first two transformations is along straight paths and in the third along a path that winds clockwise around the origin , become @xcite : @xmath85    @xmath86    @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "let us denote this mapping class group by @xmath94 .",
    "here 1 stands for the genus and 2 for the number of punctures .",
    "similarly let @xmath95 denote the full braid group of two strings on the torus .",
    "then we have the following short exact sequence @xcite : @xmath96 @xmath97 is generated by the following generators :    =    these generators inject into @xmath94 by doing twists in a neighbourhood of the above paths in such a way that in the non punctured torus they project to the identity .",
    "that is one twists to bring the punctures along the paths indicated and then untwists so that once the punctures are forgotten , the mapping class group elements deform to the identity . in @xcite",
    "a set of relations was derived for @xmath95 .",
    "noting that the center corresponds to the translation of both punctures by an a or b cycle , then we have the following relations for @xmath97 : @xmath98    we need also lifts of the generators of the mapping class group of the nonpunctured torus . the best way to see these lifts",
    "is by the way they act on a set of generators of the fundamental group of the two punctured torus . here",
    "the generators chosen are the ones shown in the following diagrams :    =    the relations that these lifted generators @xmath99 and @xmath100 satisfy should project to the usual sl(2,z ) relations , that is @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "this means that the products @xmath103 and @xmath104 can be expressed in terms of @xmath105 . by considering the action of these products on the fundamental group",
    "it is easy to check that the relations become : @xmath106 here it is useful to remember that trivial elements of the mapping class group act by inner automorphisms on the fundamental group of the two punctured torus by moving the base point .",
    "so two automorphisms of this fundamental group can be identified if they differ by an inner automorphism . as an example",
    "we deduce the second of these relations :    =    now to get the mixing relations we need only to consider the products @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 . these project to 1 , so they should be expressible in terms of @xmath81 . to see why it is sufficient to consider these expressions consider an identity of the form word=1 .",
    "we can use the above relations to collect @xmath99 and @xmath100 on one side of the word . upon projection",
    "only @xmath99 and @xmath100 survives , and the projected product is 1 .",
    "so we can use the lifted sl(2,z ) identities to express this product in terms of the braid group generators . since there is not any further relation satisfied by the projected s and t , this is always possible .",
    "so we are left with a braid generators relation and we know a complete set of such relations .",
    "so the above products give the only new relations of our generators .",
    "it is not very difficult to show that the new relations we get are the following : @xmath113 @xmath114",
    "now lets go back to the transformation matrices of the conformal blocks .",
    "the way to construct identities of the transformation matrices is to consider contractible loops in the z - plane . here",
    "the blocks were described as densities on the universal cover of the torus with branch points at the points @xmath115 .",
    "note that we have the matrix b associated to the analytic continuation @xmath83 and this is different from the matrix associated to the transformation @xmath118 because by continiously moving z we can not move the straight path from @xmath119 to @xmath120 to the straight path from @xmath121 to @xmath119 without crossing a branch point .",
    "so let us denote the matrix associated to the second transformation by @xmath122 .",
    "we have a transformation matrix that allows us to move around the origin and this is the @xmath19 matrix .",
    "in fact @xmath123 will give us the monodromy matrix for carrying @xmath121 clockwise , through the cut from 0 to @xmath124 , back to @xmath121 .",
    "so we have @xmath125 .",
    "the first three diagrams correspond to the following identities : @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 .",
    "the fourth diagram corresponds to the identity @xmath129 also , noticing that doing twice the transformation @xmath130 corresponds to the transformation @xmath131 we get the identity @xmath132 .",
    "the factor @xmath133 appears because the blocks are really densities , and in the s matrix we have already taken this into account .",
    "the last two identities relate the s and t transformations to the braiding generators .",
    "there is also one more relation .",
    "this is the relation @xmath134 satisfied by s and t transformations as can be seen again by analytic continuation arguments .",
    "these identities have been tested for levels k=1,2,3 for the matrices given in the previous section .    finally , it is not difficult to check that if we let @xmath135 and @xmath136 the mapping class group relations are satisfied .",
