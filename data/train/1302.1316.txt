    "in @xcite , v.i . arnold introduced a theorem stating that the family of graphs of solutions of any linear second - order differential equation ( lsode ) , with arbitrary time dependent coefficients , is locally diffeomorphic to the family of graphs of solutions of the simplest one - dimensional equation of motion , i.e. , the equation of motion of a free particle .",
    "this important result allows to establish a direct relationship between the symmetries of an arbitrary classical linear system , whose equation of motion is a lsode , with that of the free particle , which is known to have the largest possible symmetry group , @xmath0 ) .",
    "the diffeomorphism was explicitly given in @xcite , namely the classical arnold transformation ( cat ) , and can be seen as a particular class of more general lie transformations relating systems defined by second order differential equations with the free particle @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , the authors , in collaboration with v. aldaya and f. cosso , introduced the quantum version of the cat , the quantum arnold transformation ( henceforth qat ) , as a unitary map that relates the hilbert space of solutions of the time - dependent schrdinger equation for a generalized caldirola - kanai oscillator ( the quantum version of a classical system whose equation of motion is a lsode ) into the corresponding one for the free particle . in the present paper",
    "we revise the qat and extend it in two respects .",
    "first , we give the explicit transformation connecting quantum physical systems with arbitrary time - dependent quadratic hamiltonians with the free particle system , here called the gauged qat .",
    "second and more importantly , we describe the transformation that links any lsode - system to any other lsode - system in terms of cat s , giving rise to a generalization of the ermakov - pinney equation , and for that reason we shall call it the arnold - ermakov - pinney transformation , providing also its quantum version .",
    "although the qat is very recent , the cat is more than thirty years old and , since it was introduced , many authors have used it ( even without realizing it ) and have built something similar to the qat . even before that , lewis and riesenfeld ( 1969 ) @xcite introduced a technique to obtain solutions of the time - dependent schr \" odinger equation ( tdse ) for a time - dependent quadratic hamiltonian ( tdqh ) as eigenfunctions of quadratic invariants . for that purpose",
    "they wrote the solutions in terms of auxiliary variables that satisfy the classical equations of motion ( something that resembles the cat ) .",
    "dodonov & manko ( 1979 ) @xcite constructed invariant operators for the damped harmonic oscillator and introduced coherent states , using a method similar to that of lewis and riesenfeld .",
    "jackiw ( 1980 ) @xcite gave ( implicitly ) the quantum transformation from the harmonic oscillator ( even with a @xmath1 term ) to the free particle when studying the symmetries of the magnetic monopole .",
    "junker & inomata ( 1985 ) @xcite gave the transformation of the propagator , in a path integral approach , for a tdqh , into the free one ( the equivalent of the qat , but in terms of propagators ) .",
    "takagi ( 1990 ) @xcite gave the quantum transformation from the harmonic oscillator to the free particle , interpreted as the change to comoving coordinates .",
    "bluman & shtelen ( 1996 ) @xcite gave the ( non - local ) transformation of the tdse for a tdqh plus a non - linear term into the free particle one , in the context of transformations of pdes .",
    "kagan et al .",
    "@xcite and independently castin & dum @xcite ( 1996 ) introduced a scaling transformation in the gross - pitaevskii equation describing bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) which is related to the qat .",
    "suslov et al .",
    "( 2010 ) @xcite computed the propagator for a tdqh using the classical equations . to the best of the authors knowledge",
    ", the quantum arnold transformation can be not only very useful to perform certain analytic calculations , but key to unify different concepts scattered through the mentioned literature in a simplified framework .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section [ sec : cat ] we revise the classical arnold transformation . after that we go on with the quantum arnold transformation in section [ sec : qat ] .",
    "finally two extensions are described in section [ sec : ext ] : the gauged qat and the arnold - ermakov - pinney transformation .",
    "to set up the framework in which the classical arnold transformation acts , let us briefly remind the subject of lie symmetries of ordinary differential equations .",
    "a lie symmetry of an ordinary differential equation ( ode ) is a coordinate transformation that sends solutions into solutions .",
    "the problem of determining the lie symmetries of an ode is rather old , and s. lie gave the main results at the end of the nineteenth century @xcite .",
    "one of these results was that a second order differential equation ( sode ) @xmath2 has the maximal number of lie symmetries ( @xmath3 ) if it can be transformed to the free equation by a point transformation : @xmath4 this linearization is possible if the ode is of the form : @xmath5 with @xmath6 satisfying some _ integrability conditions _",
    "( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "there is a nice geometric interpretation of this condition in terms of projective geometry .",
    "the non - linear sode ( [ edo ] ) is obtained by projection from the geodesic equations in a 2-dim riemannian manifold .",
    "the coefficients @xmath6 are in one - to - one correspondence with thomas projective parameters @xmath7 , and the integrability conditions that they satisfy are the conditions for the riemann tensor to be zero ( see @xcite ) .",
    "arnold named this process _",
    "rectification _ or _ straightening _ of the trajectories , and studied the case of linear sode ( lsode ) , giving explicitly the point transformation for this case @xcite . in the next subsection we describe it in detail",
    ".      a general linear second order differential equation ( lsode ) is given by the differential equation : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are functions of @xmath11 .",
    "the classical arnold transformation ( cat ) is a point transformation that is a local diffeomorphism : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are , in general , open intervals containing @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are independent solutions of the homogeneous lsode satisfying the canonicity conditions : @xmath19 @xmath20 is a particular solution of the inhomogeneous lsode satisfying @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the wronskian of the two solutions . here @xmath15 is an arbitrary time , conveniently chosen to be @xmath23 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the cat transforms the original lsode ( [ lsode ] ) into that of the free particle , up to a factor : @xmath24    the presence of this factor implies that patches of trajectories of ( [ lsode ] ) are transformed into patches of straight ( free ) trajectories . in fact , an arbitrary trajectory solution of ( [ lsode ] ) can be written as @xmath25 , and the cat sends it to @xmath26 .",
    "while @xmath11 varies in the interval @xmath13 defined by two consecutive zeros of @xmath27 ( containing @xmath15 ) , @xmath28 varies in the range of the map defined by @xmath29 . in the case",
    "in which @xmath27 has one zero , @xmath13 is ( left- or right- ) unbounded , and , if it has no zeros , @xmath13 is @xmath30 .",
    "even though the cat is a local diffeomorphism , it can be defined for an arbitrary time @xmath15 .",
    "thus different cats can be defined for different times @xmath15 and cover in this way a complete trajectory of ( [ lsode ] ) .",
    "we shall show with the example of the harmonic oscillator how this can be done .",
    "the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) is the best example to understand how the cat works . for this case , and considering @xmath31 , the two solutions are @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the open interval @xmath13 defined by two consecutive zeros of @xmath27 , and containing @xmath23 , is @xmath34 , and the cat @xmath35 and its inverse @xmath36 are then written as : @xmath37 @xmath38    in this case @xmath39 .",
    "pictorially , the cat for the ho can be represented as in figure  [ figura - cat ] , where velocities have also been included in the graphic for clarity . here",
    "@xmath35 maps the solid part of the helix ( half a period of a harmonic oscillator trajectory ) into the whole line ( a free particle trajectory ) .",
    "the horizontal plane represents the space of all possible initial conditions at @xmath40 .",
    "note that both trajectories are tangent when projected onto this plane , due to the conditions ( [ canonicity ] ) .",
    "see @xcite for more details in this case .",
    "for the cat to map other patches of the ho trajectories into the free particle trajectories , different branches of the @xmath41 function in the inverse cat ( [ cat - ho - inv ] ) should be used ( and a different @xmath42 for the cat ) . for each integer @xmath43 ,",
    "let us take @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the solutions verifying conditions ( [ canonicity ] ) at @xmath46 are @xmath47 .",
    "define a pair of cat and inverse cat from @xmath48 into @xmath49 of the form : @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where the @xmath43-th branch of the @xmath41 function has been used in @xmath52 .",
    "an _ unfolded _ version of the cat , @xmath53 , can be built by joining all the patches @xmath54 , defining an application that maps a complete trajectory @xmath55 of the harmonic oscillator into a trajectory @xmath56 of the free particle .",
    "@xmath53 is periodic on @xmath11 with period @xmath57 , although discontinuous .",
    "other simple examples where this construction can be done are the damped particle and the damped harmonic oscillator , see @xcite for details .",
    "an arbitrary lsode system ( [ lsode ] ) can be derived from the lagrangian ( we shall take @xmath31 for simplicity but the whole formalism can be developed with @xmath58 , see @xcite ) : @xmath59 and from this the hamiltonian @xmath60 is derived , which is known as the generalized caldirola - kanai ( gck ) hamiltonian for a damped oscillator ( see @xcite and references therein ) . the case in which @xmath61 and @xmath62 are",
    "constants corresponds to the original caldirola - kanai hamiltonian for a damped harmonic oscillator @xcite , and whose corresponding lagrangian was given for the first time by bateman @xcite , after a constraint to the bateman dual system is imposed @xcite .",
    "canonical quantization of the gck hamiltonian leads to the time - dependent schrdinger equation : @xmath63    the cat @xmath35 is a local ( in time ) diffeomorphism between the space of solutions of the lsode system ( [ lsode ] ) and the space of solutions of the free particle .",
    "we would like to extend it to a unitary transformation @xmath64 , the quantum arnold transformation ( qat ) , between the hilbert space of solutions @xmath65 of the time - dependent schrdinger equation for the gck oscillator ( [ ckeq ] ) at time @xmath11 , @xmath66 , into the hilbert space of solutions @xmath67 of the time - dependent schrdinger equation for the galilean free particle @xmath68 at time @xmath28 , @xmath69 .",
    "the desired extension is given by : @xmath70 here @xmath71 is the pullback of the cat @xmath35 , acting on functions ( i.e. @xmath72 ) . the qat can be diagrammatically represented as : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the common hilbert space of solutions of the schrdinger equation for both systems at @xmath75 ( we shall take , for simplicity , @xmath23 , as before ) , @xmath76 is the unitary time - evolution operator for the gck oscillator and @xmath77 is the corresponding one for the galilean free particle .",
    "the map at the bottom of the diagram is the identity due to conditions ( [ canonicity ] ) ; otherwise a non - trivial unitary transformation appears ( see @xcite ) .    from the commutative diagram ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath78 is unitary given the unitarity of the evolution operators .",
    "however , it can also be checked explicitly that the scalar product of two states in @xmath79 at a given time @xmath28 is the same than that of the transformed states by @xmath78 in @xmath80 at the corresponding time @xmath11 :    @xmath81    where @xmath28 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and the integration limits have been transformed according to the cat .",
    "the qat inherits from the cat the local character in time , in the sense that it is valid only for @xmath84 and @xmath85 , although it can be defined for an arbitrary initial time @xmath15 . to extend the qat beyond @xmath13 , we can proceed as in the classical case for the harmonic oscillator , considering the different branches of the inverse function of @xmath86 , defining an _ unfolded _",
    "qat , @xmath87",
    ".    it should be stressed that if in the different branches of the _ unfolded _ cat proper solutions verifying ( [ canonicity ] ) are not used , changes in signs can appear , which result in changes in phases in the different branches of the _ unfolded _ qat .",
    "this phenomenon is related to the maslov correction ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , it can be checked that , for the case of the harmonic oscillator previously considered , @xmath88 .      by the results of sec .",
    "[ sec : lie ] , any classical lsode system has the maximal number of lie symmetries , the ones of the free particle ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the vector fields generating these symmetries can be computed by means of the cat from the symmetries of the free particle . even though the cat is a local diffeomorphism ,",
    "these vector fields are defined for all times @xcite ( the reason for this is that the only function appearing in the denominator of the vector fields is the wronskian , which is never vanishing ) .",
    "the quantum symmetries of the free schrdinger equation ( [ free - eq ] ) are smaller than @xmath3 , only the schrdinger group preserves ( [ free - eq ] ) @xcite .",
    "the schrdinger group is a semidirect product of the ( centrally extended ) galilei group by the group @xmath89 .",
    "it is generated by the basic operators : @xmath90 in addition to their quadratic combinations ( representing scale and non - relativistic _ conformal _ transformations ) .",
    "the basic operators , together with their quadratic combinations , are constant of motion operators=0 $ ] , where @xmath91 is the hamiltonian operator for the free galilean particle .",
    "] , they are infinitesimal generators of symmetries of the free schrdinger equation ( [ free - eq ] ) , and preserve the hilbert space @xmath79 of solutions ( [ free - eq ] ) .",
    "we can import the symmetries acting on the free particle hilbert space @xmath92 ( the schrdinger group ) into the gck hilbert space @xmath66 by means of the commutative diagram ( [ diagrama - qat ] ) .",
    "the infinitesimal generators of these symmetries are : @xmath93 and their quadratic combinations ( see @xcite for the complete list of operators ) .",
    "all these operators expand a representation of the schrdinger group , are constant of motion operators for ( [ ckeq ] ) and preserve the hilbert space @xmath80 .",
    "despite of the local character of the qat , and similarly to the classical case , these operators are well defined for all @xmath94 , since the wronskian @xmath95 never vanishes .",
    "the hamiltonian for the gkc harmonic oscillator can be expressed in terms of the basic , conserved operators : @xmath96 where the time - dependent functions @xmath97 and @xmath98 are given by : @xmath99    again , since the wronskian never vanishes and the basic operators @xmath100 and @xmath101 are also well - defined for all times , this construction remains valid for all times .",
    "note that , since the basic operators @xmath100 and @xmath101 are conserved , @xmath102 is not a conserved operator ( unless @xmath103 is a constant and @xmath104 ) , and therefore an eigenvalue equation for it makes no sense ( i.e. , there is no time - independent schrdinger equation ) .    instead , any linear combination of @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 can be used to define an eigenvalue problem , and the corresponding eigenvectors would constitute a basis for the solution of the generalized caldirola - kanai schrdinger equation ( see @xcite and references therein ) .      from the commutative diagram ( [ diagrama - qat ] ) and from ( [ unitarityqat ] )",
    "it is clear that the qat is a unitary operator , and this has interesting and far - reaching consequences . among them",
    "we can mention the possibility of importing operators ( symmetries ) from one system to the other , importing wave functions , scalar product , computing the time evolution operator , etc .",
    "we shall not discuss them here , referring the reader to @xcite for details .",
    "the qat have many more and very interesting applications and generalizations .",
    "one of them is the application of the qat to density matrices , transforming the quantum liouville equation of an arbitrary time - dependent quadratic hamiltonian into the free one @xcite , with the possibility of extending it and to wigner functions and other quasi - probability distributions , or even the extension of the qat to lindblad type equations , in order to study dissipation and decoherence under the qat point of view .",
    "it can also be applied to bose - einstein condensates , to transform the time - dependent potential ( oscillator traps with time - dependent frequencies ) into a time - independent potential .",
    "the qat can also be relevant in quantum inflationary cosmological models , where quantum fluctuations of the scalar field are governed , under some assumptions , by a lsode with a dissipative term .    among the possible generalizations of the qat , we mention the relativistic case , as the quantum version of a generalized cat for geodesic equations in a fixed background and with external forces , or as the quantum version of _ geodesic mappings _ , that transform geodesics of a metric into geodesics of a different metric ( beltrami theorem ) .",
    "other possible generalizations refer to non - linear potentials ( the quantum lie transformation ) , to second order riccati equations ( see for instance @xcite ) , or even to non - local potentials like in the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "in this section we shall introduce the main results of the paper : two immediate , although non - trivial , extensions of the qat .",
    "the first one is to allow for more general schrdinger equations than the gkc one .",
    "the second one is the transformation relating two lsode - systems , denoted as the arnold - ermakov - pinney transformation , obtained as the composition of the cat corresponding to the first lsode - system with the inverse of the cat corresponding to the second lsode - system , as well as the corresponding quantum version .",
    "the qat , as it has been designed , transforms the solutions of the schrdinger equation of the gkc oscillator into that of the free particle .",
    "it can not transform , as it stands , the solutions of the schrdinger equation associated with an arbitrary time - dependent quadratic hamiltonian .",
    "the reason is the choice of solutions @xmath108 satisfying the canonicity condition ( [ canonicity ] ) and the fact that the classical counterpart , the cat , transforms the lsode ( [ lsode ] ) into that of the free particle .",
    "suppose that the quantum hamiltonian is an arbitrary , time - dependent self - adjoint quadratic hamiltonian : @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are real and @xmath112 ( to have a positive - definite kinetic energy ) .",
    "then the transformation that maps solutions of the schrdinger equation for this hamiltonian into that of the free particle is given by :    @xmath113    where @xmath114 and @xmath27 are canonical solutions ( in the sense of ( [ canonicity ] ) ) verifying the lsode ( [ lsode ] ) with @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the wronskian of the two solutions is @xmath117 .",
    "note that the transformation ( [ gaugedqat ] ) is an ordinary qat times an extra _ gauge _ term @xmath118 : @xmath119 for this reason we shall denote this transformation gauged qat ( gqat ) . in the case where @xmath120 , the gqat turns into an ordinary qat .",
    "note that @xmath121 can be interpreted as a time - dependent mass , and therefore the hamiltonian can be written as    @xmath122    where @xmath123 , and the _ classical _ damping coefficient and frequency are written now as @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "although the cat relates any lsode system with the free particle , the dynamics of both systems can be very different .",
    "thus , it could be interesting to relate directly two arbitrary lsode systems with similar behaviour , and this can be achieved by composing a cat and an inverse cat .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath126 and @xmath127 denote the cats relating the lsode - system 1 and lsode - system 2 to the free particle , respectively , then @xmath128 relates lsode - system 2 to lsode - system 1 .",
    "@xmath129 can be written as : @xmath130    the explicit form of the transformation can be easily computed by composing the two cats , resulting in : @xmath131 where @xmath132 satisfies the non - linear sode : @xmath133\\,,\\ ] ] and where @xmath134 refers to the @xmath135-th particular solution for system @xmath136 ; @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 stand for the wronskian and the lsode coefficients for system @xmath136 ; and the dot means derivation with respect to the corresponding time function .",
    "for the particular case where lsode - system 1 is a harmonic oscillator ( @xmath140 and @xmath141 ) , this expression simplifies to : @xmath142 resulting in a generalization of the ermakov - pinney equation . for @xmath143 the ermakov - pinney equation ( also known as milne - pinney )",
    "is recovered @xcite : @xmath144 representing a harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath145 with an extra inverse squared potential @xmath146 . for @xmath147 ,",
    "the arnold - ermakov - pinney transformation reduces to the ordinary cat , i.e. @xmath148 .    the ermakov - pinney equation is related to the ermakov invariant @xcite and appears in many branches of physics , such as cosmology @xcite , bec @xcite , etc .",
    "its generalization to higher dimensions , know as ermakov pairs ( or system ) , appears in bec @xcite and what is known as kepler - ermakov systems @xcite .",
    "the ermakov - pinney equation entails a kind of nonlinear superposition principle , in the sense that its solutions can be written in terms of the solutions @xmath149 of the corresponding linear equation ( with @xmath147 ) : @xmath150    the other way round , the general solution @xmath151 of the linear equation can be writen in terms of a paricular solution @xmath152 of the ermakov - pinney equation ( [ ermakov - pinney ] ) as : @xmath153 where @xmath154 are arbitrary constantss and @xmath155 .",
    "note that this equation is just ( [ arnold - ermakov - pinney ] ) for @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 . as a result , the general solution of ( [ ermakov - pinney ] ) can be determined from a particular solution @xmath152 using ( [ pinney - oscilador ] ) and ( [ oscilador - pinney ] ) .",
    "the quantum version of the arnold - ermakov - pinney transformation , @xmath161 , can be obtained computing the composition of a qat and an inverse qat , to give : @xmath162    the quantum arnold - ermakov - pinney transformation is a unitary map importing solutions of a gck schrdinger equation from solutions of a different , auxiliary gck schrdinger equation which , in particular , can be the one corresponding to a harmonic oscillator .",
    "in that case the transformation is very similar to the one used in bec , known as scaling transformation to transform the time - dependent potential ( oscillator traps with time - dependent frequencies ) into a time - independent harmonic oscillator potential @xcite .",
    "also , in that case ( i.e. for @xmath163 ) equation ( [ aep ] ) reduces to the transformation given by hartley and ray @xcite ( this was already given by lewis and riesenfeld in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the quantum arnold - ermakov - pinney transformation allows to choose in a suitable way the auxiliary system from which the solutions may be imported .",
