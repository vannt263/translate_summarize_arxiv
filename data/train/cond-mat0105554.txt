    "algebraic models have been used very successfully in nuclear physics and have led to new insights into the nature of complex many body systems [ 1 ] .",
    "similar methods have been proposed to describe molecular excitations [ 2,3 ] .",
    "the methods combine lie algebraic techniques , describing the interatomic interactions , with discrete symmetry techniques associated with the molecules . in the framework of the algebraic model [ 2 ] ,",
    "the anharmonic effects of the local interactions are described by substituting the local harmonic potentials by morse - like potential , associated with the @xmath0 algebra .",
    "the one - dimensional morse hamiltonian is written in terms of the generators @xmath1of @xmath0 ,    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is a constant .",

    "the morse potential spectrum thus leads to a deformation of the harmonic oscillator algebra . a more detailed relationship between",
    "the morse coordinates and momenta and the @xmath20 generators can be derived through a comparison of their matrix elements [ 5 ] .",
    "note that for an infinite potential depth , @xmath21 , the morse potential can not be distinguished from the harmonic potential .",
    "the anharmonic model has been developed to analyze molecular vibrational spectra [ 2 - 8 ] .",
    "it provides a systematic procedure for studying vibrational excitations in a simple form by describing the stretching and bending modes in a unified scheme based on @xmath0 algebras which incorporate the anharmonicity at the local level .",
    "the aim of this paper is to apply the algebraic approach to the vibrational high - temperature thermodynamics of a diatomic molecule and obtain the basic thermodynamic functions in terms of the parameters of the anharmonic model .",
    "these results must be combined with the translational and rotational thermodynamic functions in order to compare with experiment , in a fashion similar to that of reference [ 9 ] . here , we concentrate our attention on the derivation of analytic results which will be applied in a subsequent paper [ 10 ] .",

    "this integral can be evaluated exactly in terms of the error function , @xmath34 ( see [ 11 ] ) ,    @xmath35    equation ( 9 ) represents the high - temperature value of the vibrational partition function in the morse - like spectrum .",
    "when @xmath36 , the harmonic limit of the model is obtained ,    @xmath37    which coincides with the harmonic vibrational partition function of a diatomic molecule at high temperatures .",
    "having the partition function @xmath38  in terms of the parameters of the algebraic model , we are now in position to derive the basic thermodynamic functions",
    ". an algebraic approach has been used in [ 12 ] to study the thermodynamic properties of molecules . however",
    ", the partition function in [ 12 ] uses an approximation of the classical density of states , while we have derived an explicit function in terms of the parameters of the algebraic model which can now be used to compute the high - temperature thermodynamic functions in analytic form .",
    "the mean vibrational energy is given by    @xmath39    taking into account that @xmath40 we obtain the following expression for the mean vibrational energy in terms of the partition function @xmath38 ,    @xmath41    substituting @xmath38 by expression ( 9 ) gives , @xmath42    the harmonic limit is obtained from equation ( 13 ) , when @xmath30 @xmath43 and @xmath38 is given by ( 10 ) ,    @xmath44    this is the classical mean energy of a diatomic molecule at very high temperatures .",
