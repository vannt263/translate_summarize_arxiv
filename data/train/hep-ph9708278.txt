    "<S> the electromagnetic tensor for inclusive electron scattering off the pion , ( @xmath0 ) , for momentum transfers such that @xmath1 , ( @xmath2 ) is shown to obey a sum - rule for the component @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> > from this sum - rule , one can define the quark - antiquark correlation function in the pion , which characterizes the transverse distance distribution between the quark and antiquark in the light - front pion wave - function . within the realistic models of the relativistic pion wave function ( including instanton vacuum inspired wave function ) it is shown that the value of the two - quark correlation radius ( @xmath4 ) is near twice the pion electromagnetic radius ( @xmath5 ) , where @xmath6 fm . </S>",
    "<S> we also define the correlation length @xmath7 where the two - particle correlation have an extremum . </S>",
    "<S> the estimation of @xmath8 fm is very close to estimations from instanton models of qcd vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the above correlation is very sensitive to the pion light - front wave - function models .    ,    ,    and    electromagnetic form factors , relativistic quark model , sum rules , pion    0.2 cm    investigation of low - energy pion constants and pion form - factors at low and intermediate momentum transfers provides important information about internal dynamics of hadron constituents .  at asymptotically high momentum transfers </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of pion form - factors is defined by quark counting rules @xcite and perturbative qcd gives rigorous predictions for exclusive amplitudes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , some time ago the applicability of the perturbative approach to exclusive processes at moderately high momentum transfers has been stood under question @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the attempts to describe the pion form factor using only perturbative hard scattering mechanism is not successful and soft internal dynamics of pion constituents becomes important . </S>",
    "<S> later on , in refs.(@xcite ) , it was shown that it is necessary to include an intrinsic transverse momentum dependence of the soft pion wave function to justify perturbative qcd calculations of the pion form factors in the region of momentum transfers far below of asymptotic one . moreover , numerical analysis show that at low and intermediate momentum transfers , @xmath9 gev , the soft ( overlapping ) diagram dominates over the asymptotic ( one - gluon exchange ) ones , inspite of the fact that at large @xmath10 the first one is parametrically smaller by @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> so , detailed theoretical input and additional experimental information is needed to relate low and high energy properties of pion . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we want to consider a correlation function describing quark - antiquark correlations in transverse space direction that could be in principle measured in the electron inclusive scattering off pion at moderately high energy experiments . considering the actual interest and convenience in applying the light cone formalism to investigate the hadronic structure at low and intermediate energies </S>",
    "<S> , it will be important to derive some useful sum rules in this new context .  </S>",
    "<S> we derive for the pion a sum rule for the light cone component of the inclusive hadronic tensor @xmath3 that is diagonal in the fock state basis , which gives the quark - antiquark correlation . also , applying this sum rule , we study a few relativistic models for the pion wave - function .    </S>",
    "<S> our basic assumption is that , at energy scale less then few gev , exists a simple constituent quark wave - function containing all the relevant physical information . </S>",
    "<S> however , the relation between size , excitation spectrum and quark correlation in the hadron may be very complex . </S>",
    "<S> we suppose that the pion is a strongly bound system of constituent quarks of masses 250 - 350 mev . in this picture , </S>",
    "<S> hadron amplitudes describe the transition of hadron states into quark - antiquark pairs . </S>",
    "<S> they are of nonperturbative origin and serve as absolute normalization ( initial condition ) of the large @xmath12 behaviour calculated perturbatively .    </S>",
    "<S> we will use the light - cone constituent quark models with wave - functions defined in the null - plane hypersurface ( @xmath13)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach allows a consistent truncation of the fock - space , such that the boost transformations that keep the null - plane invariant , do not mix different fock - components @xcite ( see @xcite for a modern discussion of this problem ) .  in that respect , we can work with a fixed number of constituents quarks .    using constituent quarks degrees of freedom , the normalization of the wave function is well defined . </S>",
    "<S> it is finite . </S>",
    "<S> this fact does not forbid that the number of partons grows to infinite . </S>",
    "<S> in the limit of @xmath14 , the constituent @xmath15 , without considering the constituent quark structure , goes to zero . </S>",
    "<S> however , a description , with constituents - with - structure , has been shown @xcite to provide a reasonably accurate description of the experimental deep - inelastic structure function of the pion . </S>",
    "<S> the partonic structure function of the constituent quark is convoluted with the structure function obtained from the constituent quark wave - function . in this reference@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the experimental observation of @xmath16 being non - zero is due to the constituent quark structure in terms of the partons .    </S>",
    "<S> all light - cone operators , corresponding to physical quantities , are classified as `` good '' and `` bad '' ones , where the `` good '' operators are diagonal in the fock state basis , as a consequence of suppression of pair creation processes  @xcite .  </S>",
    "<S> we show that , by using the `` good - good '' component of the inclusive hadronic tensor , @xmath3 , for momentum transfers such that @xmath17 and integrating in @xmath18 , it is possible to introduce a sum rule for @xmath3 , which is equal to the well known sum - rule presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sum rule should approach the deep inelastic sum - rule at few gev , which diverges in the limit of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason we will consider the difference between the sum rules for charged and non - charged pions , where the divergent part is cancelled , which permits to the define the constituent quark - antiquark density in the pion .    </S>",
    "<S> the sum rule is the relativistic generalization of the coulomb sum rule for inelastic electron scattering .  </S>",
    "<S> it is well known  @xcite that the coulomb sum rule integral is the fourier transform of the two - body density . as its non - relativistic counterpart , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the relativistic sum rule defines the correlation function characterizing the transverse distance distribution of quark and antiquark in the pion . </S>",
    "<S> this allows a simple interpretation of the observable in terms of constituent @xmath20 composite light - front pion wave - function .    </S>",
    "<S> the electromagnetic tensor , @xmath0 , for the inclusive electron scattering off pion , is defined as the square of the amplitude for the photon absorption summed over all final hadron states : @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the four vector of the pion and @xmath23 is the photon momentum transfer . as a tensor of second rank it is written in terms of two invariant structure functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , as follows from lorentz , gauge and parity symmetries : @xmath26 + \\frac{w_2(q^2,q.p)}{m_\\pi^2 } \\left[p^\\mu - \\frac { { p. q } q^\\mu}{q^2}\\right ] \\left[p^\\nu - \\frac { { p. q } q^\\nu}{q^2}\\right ] . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{w}\\ ] ] in the rest frame of the pion , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the photon momentum can be chosen such that @xmath1 , and the component @xmath3 is given by :    @xmath29    we shall consider the sum rule @xmath30 , by integrating @xmath3 in @xmath18 at fixed @xmath31 and @xmath1 and @xmath32 is allowed . ] :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the electron charge . in the kinematics we have chosen , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , thus eq.([c ] ) is precisely the sum - rule @xmath37 at fixed @xmath38 , defined in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar sum - rule was first introduced by gottfried @xcite , where @xmath39 is integrated over the transferred energy , which is suitable for the use with instant form wave - functions .    the well known dashen - gell - mann - fubini current algebra sum rule ( see for example , the book of de alfaro et al . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) differs from that suggested in eq.([c ] ) in that respect that the first one deal with the integration of the current commutator over @xmath18 in the interval from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .  due to crossing symmetry , it becomes trivial in the case of electron inelastic scattering and provides very important restrictions in the case of neutrino scattering . in the case of the sum rule given in eq.([c ] ) , the integration over @xmath18 is performed in the half axis interval , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is not equal to zero , so it is not dominated by light - cone current algebra contribution .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that this kind of sum rule is unusual since it is of  wrong \" signature . </S>",
    "<S> really , the derivation of the sum rules of  right \" signature is based on consideration of causal amplitude which is defined via time - ordered product of currents . in that case </S>",
    "<S> the absorptive part of the amplitude is expressed through the commutator of currents satisfying causality principle . </S>",
    "<S> however , the sum rules of  wrong \" signature such as the gottfried sum rule are constructed from amplitudes of opposite crossing symmetry properties and correspond to the matrix elements of the anti - commutators of currents @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> singular on the light cone , the contributions of the current anti - commutator provide parton sum rules ( possessing scaling at @xmath44 ) and describe the @xmath45 structure of hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider not only singular contributions but also regular two - particle contributions on the light cone , which describe correlations in transverse space and correspond to power corrections to parton sum rules .    </S>",
