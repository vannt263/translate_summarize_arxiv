    "one of the most fundamental problems in modern cosmology is the nature of dark matter .",
    "this problem itself has provoked an intense theoretical search for realistic candidates able to drive the formation of the cosmological structure we observe today @xcite . among others ,",
    "there are some candidates that have for long been considered as exotic ; a paradigmatic example is the case of scalar fields , which are the simplest particles we can think of @xcite .",
    "however , no fundamental scalar field has ever been detected .",
    "nevertheless , theoretical research on scalar candidates is a very interesting field in cosmology nowadays , and many ideas have been proposed .",
    "one principal idea is that scalar fields can form bose condensates , and then are able to form structure @xcite .",
    "the quest for the kind of objects that are formed by scalar fields has been investigated in detail using numerical tools .",
    "the relativistic regime has been studied in @xcite , for both complex and real scalar fields .",
    "scalar fields are an example in which dark matter is not point - like , hence no conclusions can be extracted from the widely studied n - body simulations for dark matter particles . thus , we need to understand their properties in order to decide whether such properties could be useful to explain what we see in galaxies . on of the most attractive features of the scalar field model",
    "is that the construction of equilibrium configurations demands a smooth density profile at the origin , which is an advantage over the point - like dark matter particle models which have shown to be cuspy .",
    "in general , complex scalar fields can form stable equilibrium configurations called _ boson stars _",
    ", that are globally regular and whose energy density is time - independent , for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "real scalar fields also have equilibrium configurations , that were discovered in @xcite , and are called _ oscillatons_. the latter are also globally regular , but are fully time - dependent . as for their stability",
    ", it seems to be quite robust as far as numerical evolutions is concerned @xcite , but it may be that they are only long - lived @xcite .",
    "an important part of any scalar field model of dark matter is the _ scalar potential _",
    "@xmath0 , which encodes in itself the self - interactions of the scalar field other than gravitational . the most popular scalar potential , and",
    "also the most studied in cosmology , is the quadratic one , @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 if the scalar field is complex ) , where the parameter @xmath3 is identified as the mass of the boson particle .    on the other hand ,",
    "the inverse of the mass , i.e. the compton length of the boson @xmath4 ( in units in which @xmath5 ) , becomes the natural unit of distance of scalar configurations .",
    "actually , the most compact scalar objects have a radius of a few compton lengths . in addition",
    ", the boson mass also establishes the mass scale of the compact object , which is of the order @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the planck mass .",
    "thus , a light scalar mass may provide of very massive objects@xcite",
    ". however , scalar potentials more complicated than the quadratic one can provide of extra parameters which can add new features to oscillatons and boson stars .",
    "one simple instance of such more general scalar potential is that containing an extra quartic coupling in the form @xmath8 , see @xcite and references therein . in this case",
    "we speak of a self - interacting scalar field with total energy @xmath9 . ] .",
    "the influence a quartic self - interaction can have in the dynamics of a cosmological _ complex _ scalar field has been widely studied in the literature , for recent developments see@xcite . however , there are also some changes with respect to the free case",
    ". the self - interaction term can become important in situations in which the scalar field has large amplitude , which may happen typically in the early universe , and in the interior of compact scalar objects .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , it should be mentioned that a quartic term makes , for a given scalar field strength , a boson star larger and more massive than in the free case@xcite .    on the other hand _ oscillatons _ with self - interacting terms in the scalar potential have not been studied yet .",
    "the reason for this may be an intrinsic difficulty in dealing with time - dependent relativistic configurations .    nevertheless , a curious point is that the newtonian regime is the same for boson stars and oscillatons .",
    "the relativistic ekg equations in this regime are equivalent to the so - called schrdinger - poisson ( sp ) system , see @xcite and references therein .    for a free scalar potential",
    ", the newtonian equilibrium configurations can be as large as a galactic halo if the mass of the boson is very light @xcite . that the newtonian regime is the astrophysically interesting one can be seen if one calculates the compton length associated to a ( very light ) boson mass of order @xmath10 ev ;",
    "this is @xmath11 pc@xcite . from the point of view of particle physics , this boson mass is extremely small .",
    "therefore , such a light boson will form _ relativistic _ objects which are small compared to typical galactic scales . however , in the _ newtonian _ regime , gravity is weaker and allows the formation of much larger scalar objects .    within the newtonian regime , there are also equilibrium solutions for different number of nodes of the wave function ; solutions with nodes are called excited newtonian boson stars and are classified according to the number of nodes the wave function has .",
    "zero - node states are called _ ground _ states , and configurations with nodes are generically called _",
    "excited states_. such excited states were also considered in the past as candidates for dark matter halos in galaxies @xcite .",
    "they have the nice property of providing nearly flat rotation curves if the number of nodes is sufficiently large , see the example shown in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , those excited boson stars are not stable , and they decay into a ground state in a time much smaller than the actual age of the universe @xcite ; the attractor behavior of the ground state configurations is shown below in this paper for initially excited state equilibrium configurations .",
    "this fact rules out the possibility of excited boson stars as dark matter halos ; nevertheless , they could still play the role of transient states in the evolution of scalar field configurations .",
    "it is interesting to note that the sp system has been widely studied in other fields out of cosmology , see the interesting works in @xcite .",
    "also , they have been proposed to ameliorate the quasar s redshift problem in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we want to study the case of scalar configurations with a self - interaction term in the newtonian limit , that is , we shall study the sp system including a quartic self - interaction term . in doing this",
    ", we will learn about the properties that both a boson star and an oscillaton have in the weak field limit .",
    "scalar field configurations with a quartic self - interaction have been proposed before to be the dark matter in galaxies , see @xcite .",
    "but , it is necessary to understand the dynamical properties of such configurations . in this sense",
    ", this paper extends the research already done in@xcite for the ( free field ) sp system .    assuming spherical symmetry , the schrdinger - poisson ( sp ) system of equations to be solved reads [ sp ] @xmath12 we have used the dimensionless variables @xmath13 , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the physical time and radial coordinates , respectively , and @xmath3 is the mass of the boson .    the wave function @xmath17 is coupled to its own gravitational potential @xmath18 , and the constant @xmath19 represents the @xmath20-wave scattering length in the gross - pitaevskii approximation for bose condensates @xcite .",
    "it is known that the sp set of equations without self - interaction has a fancy scaling property @xcite that simplifies the numerical research .",
    "it is possible to establish a similar scaling property when a self - interaction term is included .",
    "that is , eqs .",
    "( [ sp ] ) are invariant under the transformation @xmath21    with @xmath22 an arbitrary parameter .",
    "unfortunately , there is a main difference with respect to the non - interacting case . in the latter , the solution of the sp assuming @xmath23 generates the whole and unique branch of possible equilibrium solutions .    for the new sp equations  ( [ sp ] )",
    ", it is necessary to find first all possible solutions that belong to a _",
    "single _ value of the self - interaction coefficient @xmath19 .",
    "if we now scale the latter using a certain @xmath22 , we can generate a full _ new _ branch of solutions for @xmath24 out of the one belonging to the old @xmath19 .",
    "though not as easy as in the free case , the scaling transformation  ( [ eq : scaling ] ) will still help us to understand the evolution of a scalar field configuration under an arbitrary value of @xmath19 .",
    "there is also a complete set of physical quantities that are well defined in the newtonian limit .",
    "they obey the following scaling transformation    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the density of probability , @xmath27 is the integral of @xmath26 over the whole space , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the expectation values of the kinetic and gravitational energies , and @xmath30 is the expectation value of the self - interaction energy .",
    "the above quantities will help us to follow the evolution of an arbitrary scalar field configuration and establish criteria about virialization and equilibrium ,    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ivp ] , we present the solution to the initial value problem that will be the equilibrium configurations of the sp system . in sec .  [ sec : numerics ] , we describe the numerical methods and the boundary conditions used for the time evolution of the sp system .",
    "after that , in sec .",
    "[ sec : cooling ] , we describe what we mean by virialization of non - equilibrium configurations and the late - time attractor behavior of the sequence of equilibrium configurations . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we draw some comments and conclusions .",
    "for equilibrium configurations , we assume that the wave function is of the form @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a free parameter .",
    "this assumption implies that the density of probability @xmath26 and the gravitational potential @xmath18 are time - independent , whereas the wave function evolves harmonically in time .",
    "( [ schroedinger ] ) and  ( [ poisson ] ) become @xmath33    the above system has to be solved under the condition of regularity at the origin @xmath34 , and isolation @xmath35 ; we will also demand that @xmath36 .",
    "these boundary conditions determine in a unique manner the values of @xmath37 and @xmath32 , which are the only free parameters of the solution .",
    "we made a numerical routine that solves eqs .",
    "( [ schroedinger ] ) and  ( [ poisson ] ) using a shooting procedure that tunes the values of @xmath32 and @xmath37 for a given central value @xmath38 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : plotone ] , we show the profiles of the initial wave function for some positive and negative values of the self - interaction coefficient @xmath19 . also shown in",
    "there are the branches of equilibrium configurations for four different values of @xmath19 .",
    "as expected , for @xmath39 there is nothing like a maximum indicating an unstable branch , which is always present ( and typical ) in relativistic boson configurations @xcite .",
    "in order to numerically evolve the sp system , we make a discretization of space and time , and approximate all derivatives using second order accurate finite differencing .",
    "the sp system is evolved one time step @xmath40 using eq .",
    "( [ schroedinger ] ) to obtain a new wave function , and then we solve eq .",
    "( [ poisson ] ) to find the corresponding ( new ) gravitational potential .",
    "we use an explicit time integrator to solve eq .",
    "( [ schroedinger ] ) , as opposed to the fully implicit method used and described in@xcite , where the problem of evolution was reduced to a linear system of equations . in the present case , due to the non - linear term in the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ schroedinger ] ) , the reduction to a linear system of equations is not that simple .    in any case , independently of the numerical method used to integrate in time , we demand the evolution operator to preserve the number of particles for an _ equilibrium configuration _ @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the planck mass . ] . with a modified version of the iterative crank - nicholson evolution method @xcite",
    ", we were able to reproduce the results found with the implicit method for the linear case , and confirm that the evolution was mass - preserving for a wide range of values of @xmath19 .          _ boundary conditions_. at every time step , eq .",
    "( [ poisson ] ) is integrated inwards , and thus we applied the following boundary condition at the two outermost points of the numerical grid @xmath43    where @xmath44 labels the outermost point of the numerical domain .",
    "the whole profile of @xmath45 is then found using a sixth order accurate numerov algorithm @xcite .    as it is discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ bcu1 ] ) and ( [ bcu ] ) are equivalent to impose the condition @xmath46 on the wave function ; hence , we are forcing the system to remain in the computational domain .",
    "because we want to evolve systems out of equilibrium and allow the flow of particles out of the numerical domain , we implemented a _",
    "sponge _ over the outermost points of the grid , which consists in adding an imaginary potential @xmath47 to the schrdinger equation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the expression we use for the sponge profile is @xmath48 - \\tanh \\left ( x_c/\\delta \\right ) \\right\\ } \\",

    "it is also worth noticing that no term related to the self ",
    "interaction appears in this conservation equation since we are assuming @xmath19 is real .",
    "_ tests . _",
    "the obstacles our code must sort out are : i ) the evolution of equilibrium configurations , in which the wave function oscillates with the definite frequency @xmath32 found in sec .",
    "[ sec : ivp ] , whereas the density of probability and the gravitational potential should remain time - independent ; ii ) the convergence of physical properties of the system  ( [ props ] ) .",
    "these two tests are shown at once in fig .",
    "[ fig : plottwo ] . on the left hand side ,",
    "we show the convergence of the central density and the independence of the evolution on the location of the numerical boundary . we know that in the continuum limit , these configurations should evolve keeping @xmath52 for all times . it is shown that our approximation through finite differences converges to that value in the continuum limit .",
    "the central density shows oscillations whose amplitude converge to zero as the numerical grid is refined .",
    "we relate these oscillations to the response of the system to the intrinsic perturbation induced by the truncation error of the finite differencing approximation with a linear perturbation analysis and found excellent coincidence with the fourier analysis of the numerical evolutions . in the present case ,",
    "we deal with a non - linear schrdinger equation , and such analysis would say little about the cases with @xmath53 .",
    "nevertheless , we already have evidence that the truncation error could be responsible for this very regular oscillations . ] . on the right hand side , we show how the evolution operator preserves the number of particles all along the simulation . in a few words ,",
    "what we show in figure [ fig : plottwo ] is how the evolution method , the finite differencing and the boundary conditions work properly all together .    besides the expected results found for the cases marked with filled circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : plotone ] , we also tried to evolve configurations located to the left of the maximum for @xmath54 .",
    "such configurations are very compact , and their evolution resulted in a quick collapse and in the divergence of the central density @xmath55 . in principle , this would be the expected behavior for an unstable equilibrium configuration in the _ relativistic _ regime . however , we do not account with a clear definition of a collapsed object in terms of trapped surfaces of horizon formation during the evolution , so that it is not possible to draw accurate statements within the non - relativistic sp formalism for @xmath56 .",
    "one possibility would be to continue the evolution of the system with a relativistic code after certain compactness is achieved , however such analysis is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the virialization and stabilization of physical configurations evolving according to eqs .",
    "( [ schroedinger ] ) and  ( [ poisson ] ) with @xmath57 was first proposed in@xcite , and revised in detail in @xcite .",
    "the mechanism for relaxation consists in the ejection of scalar field bursts , and the tendency of the system to settle down onto equilibrium configurations .",
    "this process was dubbed _ gravitational cooling_.    the criterion to determine whether or not a system was near an equilibrium state involves monitoring the virial theorem relation @xmath58    where @xmath59 are the expectation values of the kinetic , self - interaction , and gravitational potential energies , respectively , for the sp system ( see for instance @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : plottwo ] , we also show the oscillatory behavior of the quantity @xmath60 , whose amplitude converges to zero in the continuum limit .          in fig .",
    "[ fig : plotthree ] , we show the virialization process for two different values of @xmath19 .",
    "the initial profile is of the form @xmath61 , with @xmath62 a free parameter .",
    "the reason why we choose such initial profile is that it provides a high initial kinetic energy , and the process of virialization ( if any ) will be evident while calculating eq .",
    "( [ eq : virial ] ) ; other initial profiles of garden variety have been evolved , however the overwarmed initial configurations shown here present in a better way the relaxation process .",
    "the case @xmath57 is as simple as those found in the past @xcite , because it is possible to choose any profile with the confidence that the configuration will approach a rescaled equilibrium configuration ( as shown in @xcite ) , but we want to be sure that the same happens for @xmath63 .",
    "our expectations were fulfilled because of the manifest results in fig .  [",
    "fig : plotthree ] .",
    "all of the studied cases show a relaxation process towards one of the equilibrium configurations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plotone ] . with these results , we confirm that the equilibrium configurations in fig .  [ fig : plotone ] , which are solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ sch - spherical ] ) and  ( [ poi - spherical ] ) , are indeed late - time attractor solutions .",
    "to finish with , we show some numerical runs of excited states for @xmath57 and @xmath64 in fig .  [",
    "fig : excited ] . as expected",
    ", all excited configurations we tried are intrinsically unstable , and eventually settle down onto an equilibrium configuration .",
    "the initial excited equilibrium configurations start at the far top - right in the plots , and after a short time the systems approach the branches of ground state configurations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plotone ] ; the plot corresponding to the case @xmath57 is a reproduction of fig .",
    "16 in @xcite with the appropriate redefined radius .",
    "the time of decay is of the order @xmath65 , which is a quite small time scale compared to the age of the universe , even for small values of the boson mass ev , the time decay is of order @xmath66 yr . ] .",
    "we have found stationary solutions to the spherically symmetric sp system of equations with a self - interaction term of the gross - pitaevskii type , according to the mean field approximation of bose condensates .",
    "we found that equilibrium configurations exist that are virialized and stable under the action of small perturbations .    for initial profiles with a high kinetic energy",
    ", we have shown that there are bursts of scalar field involving a considerable amount of matter of the order of half the initial mass and for stationary excited initial configuration the emission of mass is even higher ; after a while , the system relaxes and virializes around an equilibrium configuration .",
    "this shows that equilibrium configurations are late - time attractors .",
    "we have made numerical experiments with less exotic initial profiles , like gaussians , and found the same tendency to virialize and to accommodate around an equilibrium configuration .",
    "what this shows is that a rather arbitrary initial fluctuation of self - gravitating scalar field , in the newtonian regime , _ always _ evolves towards a virialized configuration , which should be compared to the relativistic case , in which some particular initial configurations lead to the formation of black holes , see@xcite .",
    "hence , a bose condensate made of ultralight scalar field particles , as those proposed to be the dark matter , _ tolerates _ the introduction of a self - interaction term in the mean field approximation .",
    "we expect the results presented all along this work could be useful for models of scalar dark matter , as some papers have explored the idea of including self - interaction terms @xcite .",
    "we also hope this work will help others to decide whether such objects can be found in the cosmos .",
