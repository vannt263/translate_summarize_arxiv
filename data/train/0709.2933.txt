    "a _ double occurrence word _ is a finite string of symbols in which each symbol appears precisely twice . for example",
    ", @xmath5 is a double occurrence word in the symbols @xmath6 .",
    "two distinct symbols in a double occurrence word are said to be _ interlaced _ if each appears precisely once between the two occurrences of the other .",
    "for example , in the word above , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are interlaced but @xmath8 and @xmath9 are not . for each double occurrence word @xmath0",
    "we have a simple graph @xmath10 , called the _ interlacement graph _ of @xmath0 in [ 1 ] , that has a vertex for each symbol in @xmath0 , and in which two vertices are adjacent if and only if their corresponding symbols are interlaced .",
    "we will denote the adjacency matrix of @xmath10 , regarded as a matrix over @xmath2 , by @xmath1 .",
    "this matrix will be called the _ interlacement matrix _ of @xmath0 .",
    "each generic smooth immersion @xmath11 generates a double occurrence word , as follows : the image of @xmath12 contains a finite set of ( transverse ) double points ; assign a unique symbol to each such point .",
    "orient @xmath13 , which induces an orientation on the image of @xmath12 .",
    "begin at a point in the image that is not a double point , and trace along the image in the positive direction , as determined by the orientation .",
    "record the double point symbols as you encounter them , stopping when you return to the starting point .",
    "the sequence of symbols so produced is a double occurrence word , which we say is _ realized _ by the immersion @xmath12 .",
    "gauss [ 2 ] addressed the question of which double occurrence words are realizable , and noted that a necessary condition for the realization of a word @xmath0 is that @xmath10 be eulerian .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions for realization have been given by marx [ 4 ] , by lovsz and marx [ 3 ] , by rosenstiehl [ 5 ] , and by de  fraysseix and ossona  de  mendez [ 1 ] .",
    "in this note , we give graph - theoretic and algebraic reformulations of a characterization of realizable double occurrence words that appears in [ 1 ] .",
    "these reformulations yield theorem  2 below .",
    "the characterization in [ 1 ] is itself a restatement of a characterization given in [ 5 ] .",
    "let @xmath14 be a finite simple graph with vertex set @xmath15 , and let @xmath16 be arbitrary . following [ 1 ] , we say that @xmath14 _ satisfies property _",
    "@xmath17 if @xmath14 is eulerian and , for each pair of distinct vertices @xmath18 and @xmath19 in @xmath14 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 have an odd number of common neighbors if and only if @xmath18 and @xmath19 are neighbors and either both are in @xmath20 or neither is in @xmath20 .",
    "( note that the requirement that @xmath14 be eulerian would arise from this condition if we allowed @xmath21 . )",
    "let @xmath22 be a finite looped graph without multiple loops or multiple edges .",
    "we say that @xmath22 is an _ orthoprojection graph _ if , for each pair of ( not necessarily distinct ) vertices @xmath18 and @xmath19 in @xmath22 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 have an odd number of common neighbors if and only if @xmath18 and @xmath19 are neighbors . ( note : a vertex in @xmath22 is a neighbor of itself if and only if it is looped . )",
    "it is not difficult to check that a graph is an orthoprojection graph if and only if its adjacency matrix , regarded as a matrix over @xmath2 , is ( symmetric and ) idempotent",
    ". the name `` orthoprojection graph '' reflects the fact that such a matrix represents an orthogonal projection with respect to the standard `` dot product '' over @xmath2 .    given a simple graph @xmath14 and a subset @xmath16 , we can form a looped graph @xmath23 by placing a loop at each vertex in @xmath20 , in which case we say that @xmath14 _ lifts _ to @xmath23 .",
    "here is our key observation .",
    "let @xmath14 be a finite simple graph with vertex set @xmath24 , and let @xmath16 be arbitrary .",
    "let @xmath25 be the adjacency matrix of @xmath14 and let @xmath26 be the diagonal matrix with @xmath27 if and only if @xmath28 , both regarded as matrices over @xmath2",
    ". then the following are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath14 satisfies property @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath23 is an orthoprojection graph .",
    "3 .   @xmath29 is idempotent over @xmath2 .    for an arbitrary vertex @xmath18 ,",
    "let @xmath30 denote the neighborhood of @xmath18 in @xmath14 , and let @xmath31 denote the neighborhood of @xmath18 in @xmath23 .",
    "note that the parity of @xmath32 differs from that of @xmath33 if and only if @xmath34 . for distinct vertices @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the parity of @xmath35 differs from that of @xmath36 if and only if @xmath18 and @xmath19 are neighbors and one is a member of @xmath20 while the other is not .",
    "from here it is not difficult to verify that a ) and b ) are equivalent . that either of these properties is equivalent to c ) follows from the fact that @xmath35 is equal ( mod 2 ) to the corresponding entry in @xmath37 .    combining this observation with the restatement of rosenstiehl s theorem that appears in the proof of theorem  10 in [ 1 ] ,",
    "we have    let @xmath0 be a double occurrence word , with interlacement graph @xmath10 and interlacement matrix @xmath1 .",
    "then the following are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath0 is realizable .",
    "2 .   @xmath10 lifts to an orthoprojection graph .",
    "3 .   there exists a diagonal matrix @xmath3 such that @xmath38 is idempotent over @xmath2 .",
    "* remark . * in light of the result above , it is natural to ask if every orthoprojection graph arises by lifting the interlacement graph of a ( necessarily realizable ) double occurrence word .",
    "the answer is `` no . ''",
    "the nine - vertex graph depicted in figure  1 is an orthoprojection graph , but is not the interlacement graph of a double occurrence word .",
    "see p.  86 of [ 6 ] .",
    "this graph is a minimal example ; each orthoprojection graph with fewer than nine vertices is the lift of an interlacement graph .",
    "see section  8 of [ 6 ] for depictions and further discussion .        * remark . *",
    "it is possible to give a self - contained topological proof of the equivalence of a ) and c ) in the statement of theorem  2 above .",
    "indeed , a proof that a ) implies c ) already appears in [ 7 ] .",
    "a key observation is that each generic smooth immersion @xmath11 with @xmath39 double points gives rise to an orthogonal direct sum decomposition of an @xmath39-dimensional vector space over @xmath2 , as follows : from @xmath40 , remove a small open disk centered at each of the @xmath39 double points .",
    "this yields a compact surface whose boundary is the disjoint union of @xmath39 circles . on each of these boundary circles ,",
    "identify points antipodally .",
    "( if necessary , isotope @xmath12 so that its image meets each circle in two pairs of antipodal points . )",
    "the result is then a closed non - orientable surface @xmath41 of genus @xmath39 , and the image of the original curve is now embedded and separating in @xmath41 .",
    "an application of the mayer - vietoris homology sequence with coefficients taken in @xmath2 then provides the direct sum decomposition described above . in short",
    ", the checkerboard splitting of @xmath40 into white and black regions that is produced by the image of @xmath12 yields an algebraic splitting of an @xmath39-dimensional vector space over @xmath2 .",
    "such an algebraic splitting yields a pair of orthogonal projections , and thus a pair of related orthoprojection graphs .",
    "one then verifies that the resulting orthoprojection graphs are lifts of the interlacement graph of the original immersion @xmath12 ."
