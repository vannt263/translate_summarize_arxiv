    "the chianti database was first released in 1996 @xcite and it contains energy levels , radiative data and electron excitation rates for virtually all astrophysically important ions . in addition",
    "there are a number of computer routines written in idl which allow a user to compute synthetic spectra and study plasma diagnostics .",
    "the database was originally focussed towards reproducing collisionally - excited emission line spectra at ultraviolet wavelengths from 50 to 1150 .",
    "version 2 @xcite introduced many minor ion species to the database as well as routines to compute free - free and free - bound continua . the most recent version ( v.3 ) of the database @xcite extended coverage of chianti to x - ray wavelengths ( 150 ) principally through the addition of hydrogen and helium - like ions , and dielectronic recombination lines .",
    "chianti has seen applications to many different areas of astrophysics since its inception .",
    "it has been extensively used in solar physics , in particular for the analysis of spectra obtained from the cds , sumer and uvcs spectrometers on board the soho satellite ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "chianti is also used to model the instrument responses of the eit @xcite and trace imaging instruments in order to convert measured fluxes into physical parameters such as temperature and emission measure .",
    "the wide coverage of many different ions allowed chianti to be a useful aid in the verification and definition of ultraviolet spectrometers flux calibrations through the use of emission line ratios that are insensitive to the plasma conditions .",
    "examples include the serts rocket flights @xcite , and the normal incidence spectrometer and grazing incidence spectrometers on cds @xcite .    beyond the sun",
    ", chianti has seen application to analyses of the wind emission from the arches cluster of massive stars @xcite , warm gas in galaxy clusters @xcite and analyses of a number of cool stars including ab doradus @xcite , au microscopii @xcite and @xmath0 eridani @xcite .",
    "@xcite present a review of various spectroscopic diagnostic techniques that can be applied to xuv observations of active stars .",
    "they use chianti to illustrate the severe limitations that some commonly - used methods and atomic data have .",
    "@xcite obtain results in terms of stellar transition region densities , emission measures and elemental abundances that are significantly different from those of other authors .",
    "their results suggest that a large body of work on cool star atmospheres will have to be revisited and stress the importance of using assessed and up - to - date atomic data .",
    "laboratory work also plays a vital role in the assessment of cool star results , with work by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite providing valuable insights into plasma processes affecting euv and x - ray spectra .",
    "chianti also forms a significant part of other atomic database packages .",
    "aped @xcite supplements chianti with data from several other sources and is focussed towards modeling x - ray spectra .",
    "xstar @xcite is a photoionization code that uses chianti data for modelling the level balance within individual ions .",
    "chianti also forms a significant part of the arcetri spectral code @xcite .",
    "the present work describes the latest updates to chianti , including the addition of the new physical processes of proton and photon excitation of ion levels , the addition of new ions and revisions of existing ion data - sets .",
    "in version 4 of chianti extra processes are now included in the level balance equations for ions , namely proton excitation and de - excitation , photoexcitation and stimulated emission .",
    "the level balance equations are    @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are indices for the individual levels within an ion , @xmath4 is the population of level @xmath2 relative to the population of ions as a whole , and @xmath5 is the number of @xmath2 to @xmath3 transitions taking place per unit time . in previous versions of chianti ,",
    "the @xmath5 were of the form    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the radiative decay rate ( zero if @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 is the electron rate coefficient such that    @xmath10    where @xmath9 is defined in eq .  5 of @xcite",
    ", @xmath11 is the statistical weight of level @xmath2 , @xmath12 is the positive energy separation of levels @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath14 the electron temperature .    for version  4 , @xmath15 now takes the form    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the proton number density , @xmath18 is the proton rate coefficient , and @xmath19 is the generalized radiative transition rate .",
    "the inclusion of proton rates in ion level balance equations was first demonstrated to be important in solar coronal conditions by @xcite for the ion .",
    "he showed that the proton rates can become comparable to the electron excitation rates for transitions for which @xmath20 .",
    "typically only transitions within the ground configuration of an ion are important and so , compared to the electron processes , relatively little data are required to account for proton processes in a particular ion . whereas electron collision data are usually published in the form of collision strengths or maxwellian - averaged collision strengths , proton collision data are generally published directly as rate coefficients .",
    "as positively - charged ions repel protons , the rate coefficient falls to zero at the threshold energy for the transition , and so tabulated values of rate coefficients typically change by several orders of magnitude over a small temperature range .",
    "examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ proton - plot ] from ( boron - like ) and ( fluorine - like ) , where the proton rate coefficients are plotted for the ground transitions of these ions . also shown for comparison",

    "the proton rates are seen to be comparable in strength to the electron rates at the temperature of maximum ionization , @xmath21 of the ions , and become stronger at higher temperatures .",
    "we note , however , that the populations of the upper levels of ground configuration transitions are often dominated by cascading from higher levels in the ion rather than direct excitation @xcite .",

    "the @xmath22102/@xmath22128 ratio is a key density diagnostic for solar flares @xcite and active stars @xcite .      for each ion for which proton rates are available , an additional file",
    "is required in the database to contain the fits to the rate coefficients .",
    "the file has the suffix .psplups , and is exactly analogous to the .splups file for the electron fits .",
    "all of the proton transitions included in chianti are forbidden transitions taking place between levels within the same configuration , and so they are treated as type  2 in the @xcite formalism .",
    "many of the transitions required 9-point splines ( see sect .  [ sect.9-point ] ) in order to provide adequate fits .",
    "the 9-point splines can only be applied when there are at least 9 points to be fitted .",
    "for some transitions with less than 9 data points , the 5 point spline fit applied to type  2 transitions could not adequately fit the data . in these cases a new fit type , type  6 , was introduced whose scaling is as follows    @xmath23    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the scaling parameter . by taking the logarithm of the rate coefficient , the steep gradients in the rate coefficient could be overcome and reasonable 5-point spline fits obtained . as errors in the fit are amplified when fitting logarithm data , care was taken to ensure that the rate coefficients derived from the fits were @xmath261% from the original data values .",
    "for some ions the only rate coefficient data available had been calculated at a single temperature .",
    "these data were incorporated into chianti by assuming a type  2 transition and setting the five points of the spline to lie on a straight line .",
    "the gradient of the line was set such that @xmath27 at @xmath28 , and @xmath29 at @xmath30 .",
    "this method ensures that the rate coefficients derived from the spline fall sharply to zero at low temperatures , and that at high temperatures the rates tend to a constant value that is around 10% higher than the original data value .",
    "the number density of protons , @xmath17 , is required in eq .  4 and it is calculated from the ion balance and element abundance files contained in chianti through the following expression    @xmath31    where ab is the element abundance , a@xmath32 is the @xmath2th element ( i.e. , a@xmath33=h , a@xmath34=he , etc . ) , @xmath35 is the charge on the ion , and @xmath36 is the fraction of ions of element a@xmath32 in the form @xmath37 at temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the ion fractions contained in chianti are tabulated over the range @xmath38 . above and below these values , we set @xmath39 to the values for @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",

    "information already contained in chianti .",
    "it is only necessary to specify the radiation field temperature and the dilution factor , which are done through inputs to the idl procedures with the new keywords rphot and radtemp .",
    "rphot specifies @xmath50 , the distance from the center of the radiation source in source radii units , while radtemp gives the blackbody radiation temperature in k. by default , photoexcitation and stimulated emission are not included in the level balance equations unless the keywords are set .",
    "it is important to remember the assumptions in our formalism for radiation processes . for a given ion , only very specific wavelengths in the radiation continuum will affect the ion s level balance .",
    "if there are significant deviations from a blackbody spectrum at any of these wavelengths ( perhaps due to a deep absorption line ) then chianti may not model the ion entirely correctly .",
    "examples of specific uses of the extra radiation processes include modeling of coronal emission lines above the surface of the sun and other cool stars when the coronal electron density falls to low enough values that electron collisions lose their potency .",
    "[ fe13 ] shows the @xmath2210746/@xmath2210797 ratio as a function of density , calculated in the cases of there being no radiation field ( @xmath51 ) and when the ions are located 0.1  source radii ( @xmath52 ) above the surface of a 6000  k blackbody , typical of the sun .",
    "the infrared lines are an important density diagnostic for ground - based solar coronal studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are potential probes of the solar coronal magnetic field @xcite .",
    "photoexcitation can also be important for modeling nebular ions that are irradiated by a hot star , such as in planetary nebulae , symbiotic stars and wolf - rayet stars .",
    "increasingly , the electron excitation data supplied by atomic physicists are performed in the @xmath46-matrix approximation which leads to extremely complex structure in the calculated collision strengths , @xmath53 .",
    "these data are provided in a more convenient form as maxwellian - averaged collision strengths , @xmath54 , that are a comparatively smooth function of temperature , and suitable for fitting with the 5-point splines employed in the previous versions of the chianti database . however , in some cases , it was necessary to restrict the range of the original data in order to improve the fit for temperatures of usefulness to astrophysical conditions .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fit - ups ] where one can see that at high and low temperatures ( well away from the temperature of maximum ionization , @xmath55 , of the ion ) the @xmath54 values derived from the chianti fit deviate significantly from the original data values .",
    "an accurate fit to both the low and high temperature data points would require a spline with a larger number of node points .",
    "for all of the ions included up to and including v.3 of chianti where the temperature range of the original @xmath54 data has been restricted , we have aimed to fit within 1% those data points within at least 1.0 dex of the @xmath56 of the ion .",
    "this is adequate for all conditions likely to be met in stellar transition regions and coronae .    for some situations in astrophysics ,",
    "particularly photoionized plasmas , ions can be formed at electron temperatures much lower than @xmath55 , in which case it is important to ensure accuracy of the chianti fits at lower temperatures .",
    "we thus now allow 9-point spline fits to the data .",
    "in addition , the inclusion of proton rate coefficients into chianti  described in the preceding section ",
    "requires 9-point spline fits on account of the wide range of variation of the rate coefficient with temperature .",
    "the modifications made to the database and the accompanying idl routines in order to deal with the 9-point spline fits are described in detail in a software note available from the chianti web - page at http://wwwsolar.nrl.navy.mil/chianti.html .",
    "no new chianti files are required ; the 9-point spline fit data are incorporated into the .splups files .",
    "several different methods have been employed by atomic physicists in deriving proton rate coefficients , and are reviewed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the most basic is the semiclassical ( or impact - parameter ) approach in which the position of the proton relative to the ion is treated classically and first order approximations are made for the interaction with the nucleus .",
    "this approximation was originally applied to coulomb excitation of nuclei @xcite and first extended to the proton excitation of ions by @xcite . while the first order approximation is good for low energy collisions , at intermediate energies and low impact parameter values the first order approximation fails , and it is necessary to adopt a different approximation or solve numerically the coupled differential equations describing the interaction .",
    "potentially the most accurate method is to treat the proton s trajectory quantum mechanically and solve the complete set of close - coupling equations .",
    "such an approach is commonly used in @xmath46-matrix calculations of electron collision cross - sections , however , it is computationally much more demanding for proton collisions . within the semiclassical approach",
    ", it has been shown that symmetrizing the problem with respect to the initial and final velocities @xcite , and including polarization effects @xcite can improve the accuracy of the proton cross - sections .",
    "specific methods that have yielded the data outlined in the following sections are as follows .",
    "@xcite used a symmetrized first order semiclassical approximation to calculating the proton cross - sections , and provided rate coefficients for a large number of ions with configurations @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in the intermediate energy range where first order theory breaks down",
    "they employ an approximation referred to as coulomb - bethe ii , borrowed from the theory of electron excitation of positive ions , to determine the cross - section .",
    "@xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also used the first order semiclassical approximation for low energies while for intermediate energies a form for the cross section due to @xcite was used . at high energies a further approximation to the cross - section",
    "was suggested by @xcite , and the combined cross - section yielded the rate coefficients .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it can be applied in a straightforward manner to a wide range of ions .",
    "@xcite developed a symmetrized , semiclassical close - coupling method to compute proton rates for .",
    "this method retains the classical treatment for the proton trajectory , but the transition probabilities are determined by numerically solving the close - coupling equations , removing the uncertainties at intermediate energies of the first order approximation .",
    "landman s work was extended to a number of other ions in later papers @xcite .",
    "p.  faucher used a fully quantal close - coupling method to compute proton cross - sections for a number of ions @xcite . in @xcite the two authors compared their methods for computing proton rates , and found excellent agreement , demonstrating that the semiclassical approach is a good approximation for highly - ionized ions at typical astrophysical energies .    a number of papers by v.j .",
