    "<S> it is found that fe ii  emission contributes significantly to the optical and ultraviolet spectra of most active galactic nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the optical / uv fe ii  emission is still a question open to debate . </S>",
    "<S> the variability of fe ii  would give clues to this origin . </S>",
    "<S> using 7.5 yr spectroscopic monitoring data of one palomer - green ( pg ) quasi - stellar object ( qso ) , pg 1700 + 518 , with strong optical fe ii  emission , we obtain the light curves of the continuum f_(5100 ) @xmath0  , fe ii  , the broad component of hh@xmath1  , and the narrow component of hh@xmath1  by the spectral decomposition . through the interpolation cross - correlation method </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the time lags for light curves of fe ii  , the total hh@xmath1  , the broad component of hh@xmath1  , and the narrow component of hh@xmath1  with respect to the continuum light curve . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the fe ii  time lag in pg1700 + 518 is @xmath2 days , and the hh@xmath1  time lag can not be determined . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that fe ii  and hh@xmath1  emission regions follow the virial relation between the time lag and the fwhm for the hh@xmath1  and fe ii  emission lines , we can derive that the hh@xmath1  time lag is @xmath3 days . </S>",
    "<S> the hh@xmath1  time lag calculated from the empirical luminosity  </S>",
    "<S> size relation is 222 days , which is consistent with our measured fe ii  time lag . considering the optical fe ii  contribution , pg 1700 + 518 shares the same characteristic on the spectral slope variability as other 15 pg qsos in our previous work , i.e. , harder spectrum during brighter phase . </S>"
