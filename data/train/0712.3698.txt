    "in the past few years there has been renewed interest in the edge physics of the qh system initiated by the discrepancy between the observed tunneling resistance @xcite and a simple application of wen s chiral luttinger liquid description of the edge @xcite . according to this description",
    "the luttinger parameters will have universal values determined by the topological properties of the bulk . for a luttinger liquid the electron correlation function , @xmath1 , exhibits a power law behaviour , @xmath2 , in the large @xmath3 limit , where @xmath4 is determined by the luttinger parameters . in the simplest case , @xmath5",
    ", the correlation function exponent will have a universal value determined by the filling fraction ; in the @xmath6 case it can be shown that @xmath7 .",
    "the observed tunneling resistance does indeed confirm a luttinger liquid description of the edge in the sense that the asymptotic behaviour of the edge correlation function exhibits a power law , but the exponent deviates from the universal value predicted by the general theory .    numerical works by mandal and jain ( mj )",
    "@xcite and tsiper and goldman @xcite have attributed the discrepancy to the effect of the electron - electron interaction .",
    "their results suggest that the the exponent is not universal , but is renormalized by the interaction . however , a different view is taken by wan , evers and rezayi @xcite , who suggest that the discrepancy between experiment and theory can be attributed to the details of the edge confinement . in their study",
    ", they also found a change of the correlation function due to the interaction , but only in the case of a so - called hard edge , which was used by mj and goldman and tsiper . when a soft edge was introduced , or a neutralizing background potential was introduced in the  hard edge  case , the universal exponent was retained .",
    "they suggested that the exponent is indeed universal , and that the edge confinement is responsible for the experimental results .",
    "mandal and jain @xcite studied a system in the circular gauge and introduced an interaction between composite fermions ( cf ) that induced mixing with the second cf landau level . in the cf description of the fractional qh effect ,",
    "the ground state of the system is made up of cfs fully occupying one or more cf landau levels ; i.e. the fractional qh effect is an integer qh effect of cfs . the electronic ground state is then found by multiplying the cf ground state with a jastrow factor and then projecting onto the lowest landau level ( lll ) .",
    "mj introduced a coulomb interaction and found the ground state by exact diagonalization in a hilbert space spanned by a laughlin state and states with a single cf excited to the corresponding angular momentum state in the second cf landau level .",
    "this corresponds to a hard edge since scattering to higher angular momentum states is not allowed .",
    "they found that the interaction gave rise to oscillations in the density profile and to renormalization of the asymptotic correlation function exponent .",
    "a yukawa - type interaction also renormalized the exponent , but with a value different from the coulomb case .",
    "they suggested that the exponent is not universal and its value is determined by the details of the interaction .",
    "we see no obvious reason why a similar renormalization effect should not be present in the @xmath0 case if the electron - electron interaction causes mixing with the second electronic landau level .",
    "to see whether such an effect is present , we study a model with linear geometry .",
    "each single particle orbital in a completely filled lll is allowed to mix with the same momentum orbital in the second landau level ( 2ll ) .",
    "scattering to higher momentum states is not allowed , which corresponds to a hard edge condition , as in ref .",
    "@xcite . to determine the the ground state wavefunction of the interacting system",
    ", we use the hartree - fock ( hf ) algorithm , rather than exact diagonalization .",
    "mj s results suggests that the interaction form is not important for a renormalization to take place .",
    "for that reason a gaussian interaction is chosen here , a choice which gives an easy control of both the interaction length and interaction strength .",
    "an advantage of working in the @xmath0 regime is that a calculation involving a large number of particles can easily be done .",
    "this , combined with the linear gauge , means that large system lengths can be achieved since the system length is proportional to the number of particles and @xmath8 .",
    "the calculation reported here involves 1001 particles and the fermi momentum is @xmath9 .",
    "this gives rise to a system length of about 300 magnetic lengths .",
    "the choice of linear geometry gives rise to two edges .",
    "effects of the edge - edge interaction in the @xmath0 regime will not be discussed here since it has been studied previously @xcite .",
    "the cited work only included states in the lll and scattering to higher momentum states were allowed , which makes the work complementary to the study reported here , where only mixing with the same momentum state in the 2ll is allowed . to mimic the positive background potential found in real systems a harmonic potential",
    "is introduced , and it is used to compensate for the expansion of the system due to the repulsive particle interaction .    the electron density and the electron correlation function are calculated in the ground state .",
    "we find that that the interaction gives rise to oscillations in the density profile .",
    "for a short range interaction the density , close to the edge , qualitatively resembles the edge profile reported in @xcite and @xcite . for the correlation function",
    "no renormalization of the asymptotic exponent is found .",
    "as already discussed we will work in the linear gauge where the vector potential is given by @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the single particle hamiltonian can then be written as @xmath12 where it is assumed that @xmath13 and the magnetic length , @xmath14 , and the cyclotron frequency , @xmath15 , have been introduced .",
    "the hamiltonian , ( [ eq : ham ] ) , is explicitly translationary invariant in the x - direction and energy eigenstates that are also eigenstates of @xmath16 can therefore be defined . with the momentum",
    "quantized as as @xmath17 , the hamiltonian is reduced to a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator with potential minimum at the @xmath18-dependent position @xmath19 .",
    "the energy eigenstates can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an appropriate normalization factor and @xmath22 is the @xmath23th energy eigenstate of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "note that the system is degenerate with respect to @xmath18 .",
    "let us now introduce a harmonic background potential in the @xmath24-direction : @xmath25 in the last line an effective cyclotron frequency , @xmath26 , with an effective magnetic field @xmath27 , has been introduced .",
    "we see that the first two terms in ( [ eq : hamback ] ) can be identified as the hamiltonian of an electron in the effective magnetic field @xmath28 .",
    "since the @xmath29-momentum is still a constant of motion it can be quantized , and the energy eigenstates will have the same form as before , except for a modified magnetic length @xmath30 and with @xmath31 .",
    "the last term in ( [ eq : hamback ] ) lifts the degeneracy in @xmath18 and the energy eigenvalues are given by @xmath32 where a dimensionless variable has been introduced @xmath33",
    "if we assume periodic boundary conditions of period @xmath34 in the @xmath29-direction , the energy eigenstates corresponding to the lll and the 2ll can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "the wavefunction ( [ eq : psikn ] ) is centered at @xmath37 , which means that we have a correspondence between the @xmath24-position of the particle and the particle momentum @xmath38 .",
    "let us introduce the electron interaction with a gaussian form , @xmath39 , which allows for easy control of both the interaction strength , @xmath40 , and the interaction length , @xmath41 .",
    "we will assume the ground state to have the form ; @xmath42 where @xmath43 creates a particle of momentum @xmath38 in the @xmath23th landau level and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are mixing coefficients .",
    "normalisation of the ground state requires that @xmath46 .",
    "this form easily conserves total linear momentum because each single particle orbital only includes states with the same @xmath18-number . in the weak interaction limit",
    "the mixing with the 2ll will be small and we can assume that @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "in an expansion to first order in @xmath49 we see that the ground state is a superposition of a filled lll ground state and states with one particle promoted to the 2ll .",
    "the restriction that all momenta has to be less than @xmath50 , corresponds to a hard edge.    the single particle orbitals will be of the form @xmath51 . from symmetry about the @xmath29-axis and the correspondence between @xmath18 and @xmath24 we would expect the orbitals to behave as @xmath52 .",
    "we see from ( [ eq : psikn ] ) that @xmath53 is symmetric and @xmath54 is antisymmetric ( except for the phase factor @xmath55 ) when @xmath56 .",
    "we would therefore expect @xmath44 to be symmetric and @xmath45 to be anti - symmetric when @xmath57 .    in terms of the ground state ( [ eq : gs ] )",
    "the total energy of the system is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 minimizing the energy ( [ eq : egs ] ) leads to the hartree - fock ( hf ) equation which determines the single particle orbitals @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the single particle hamiltonian and @xmath63 is an eigenvalue .",
    "the operator @xmath64 is defined as @xmath65 and the exchange operator @xmath66 by @xmath67 by introducing @xmath51 into the the hf equation and multiplying with @xmath68 and using the fact that the @xmath69 s are orthonormal , the hf equation takes the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 it is easily shown that @xmath72 , which has been used in the derivation of ( [ eq : hfmtrx ] ) . the matrix element in ( [ eq : fnm ] )",
    "is defined as @xmath73 in the limit @xmath74 the @xmath29-integrals can be performed . by introducing the gaussian interaction",
    "the matrix element takes the form @xmath75 where the integration variables @xmath24 and @xmath76 are dimensionless .",
    "the problem of finding @xmath77 has now been reduced to a @xmath78 eigenvalue problem by equation ( [ eq : hfmtrx ] ) .",
    "the problem has to be solved iteratively : one starts by calculating the matrix @xmath79 from the non - interacting ground state , @xmath80 .",
    "( [ eq : hfmtrx ] ) is solved for @xmath81 and @xmath82 corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue , @xmath63 , and highest eigenvalue , @xmath83 , respectively . the new ground state is then constructed from the set of all @xmath81 and the procedure is repeated until convergence of @xmath81 is achieved . for the final set of all @xmath81 to constitute a ground state of the system , the corresponding energy @xmath84 has to be lower than the energy @xmath85 of an excited state constructed by replacing one state @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "the requirement is therefore that @xmath88 for all @xmath89 and @xmath90 , where @xmath91 can be written as @xmath92    due to the translational invariance in the @xmath29-direction the electron correlation function will only depend on the relative distance in the @xmath29-direction , @xmath93 . in terms of the ground state coefficients @xmath94 and by using the expression for the field operator , @xmath95 ,",
    "the corrrelation function is given by @xmath96 the electron density is found from ( [ eq : corr ] ) by setting @xmath97 ; @xmath98",
    "for the numerics we have chosen @xmath9 and @xmath99 particles , which gives a system length of @xmath100 . from the correspondence between the position in @xmath24-space and @xmath18-space we see that the width of a free system is about @xmath101 . to easily relate the interaction parameters to the system size , we define the interaction length as @xmath102 , and it is given in units of magnetic lengths .",
    "for the rest of this paper all length scales are given in units of the magnetic length and all wave vectors in units of inverse magnetic length .",
    "the interaction strength , @xmath40 , is given in units of @xmath103 , while the harmonic oscillator frequency is given in units of @xmath104 .",
    "the ground states in terms of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the electron density ( [ eq : rho ] ) and the electron correlation function at the the edge , @xmath105 , have been calculated for three different cases with interaction lengths given by @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .    to make it easier to compare results with a non - interacting system , it is preferable for the interacting system to have a system width of the same size as the non - interacting case . at the same time",
    "the requirement that @xmath109 , for all @xmath89 and @xmath90 , has to be fulfilled to ensure that the ground state corresponds to a true minimum . to meet these demands both the frequency of the harmonic background potential , @xmath110 , and the interaction strength , @xmath40 ,",
    "have been tuned in such a way that both demands are satisfied .    to find the number of hf - iterations required ,",
    "@xmath94 has been plotted , as a function of @xmath18 , for different numbers of iterations and for a limited number of particles .",
    "the lowest number of iterations that does not show a change in @xmath94 from one iteration to the next , is chosen .",
    "this number of iterations have then been used for the full hf - calculation with 1001 particles .",
    "the number of iterations for the @xmath107 and @xmath108 case is 5 , and for the @xmath106 case 9 iterations have been used .     and the interacting cases with different interaction lengths .",
    "the density is measured in units of the non - interacting bulk density , @xmath111 . ]",
    "figure [ fig : dens ] shows plots of the electron density for a non - interacting system and the three interacting cases with different interaction lengths .",
    "we see that the interaction gives rise to oscillations that reach across the whole system , where the oscillation length increases with increasing interaction length .",
    "close to the edge the @xmath106 case qualitatively resembles the edge profile reported in @xcite and @xcite for the @xmath6 case .",
    "also the oscillation length , roughly @xmath112 , is of the same magnitude as in the cited references .",
    "when the the interaction is increased beyond @xmath108 , no qualitative differences can be observed in the density profile .",
    "a possible explanation is that the interaction will effectively behave like a constant background potential , when the interaction length is comparable to the system width .     and @xmath113 as a function of @xmath18 , in units of @xmath114 , for the cases shown in figure [ fig : dens ] .",

    "we see that the oscillations found in the density profile are also present in the mixing between the landau levels .",
    "it is also evident that the relative mixing between the landau levels is of the same magnitude , even if the variation in @xmath40 between the systems is quite large .",
