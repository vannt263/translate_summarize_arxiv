    "the main source of ionization and heating of the emission - line region in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is photoionization by radiation from the active centre ( ac ) . nevertheless , the contribution of shock waves , generated by the radial motion of the clouds or associated to jets , to the emission originated in the narrow line region ( nlr ) of seyfert 1 ( sy1 ) , seyfert 2 ( sy2 ) galaxies , and liners was pointed out , for example , by contini & viegas ( 2001 ) , contini ( 1997 ) , and viegas & dal pino ( 1992 ) , and more recently by authors analysing the soft x - ray spectrum of agn ( e.g. iwasawa et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the relative importance of shocks and radiation can be roughly evaluated in the different objects , because these processes act in different domains .",
    "in fact , shocks heat the gas within the clouds to high temperatures in the downstream region , so they can easily explain the observed high ionization lines ( rodriguez - ardila et al .",
    "2002 ) and soft x - ray emission ( contini , prieto & viegas 2002 , and references therein ) .    indeed ,",
    "if soft x - rays are emitted by bremsstrahlung from the nlr clouds , the gas temperature must be at least of the order 10@xmath12 k. such temperatures are obtained in the post - shock region if the shock velocity is higher than 250 .",
    "the fwhm line profiles in the nlr of seyfert 2 and seyfert 1 galaxies indicate that the cloud velocities can well be beyond this range . modelling the emission - line and continuum spectra of some seyfert 2",
    "galaxies ( e.g. ngc 5252 , circinus , ngc 4151 ) indicate the presence of very high shock velocities which can provide a thermal origin for the observed soft x - rays .    based on early observations of different galaxies by exosat ,",
    "the nature and variability of soft x - rays was investigated , revealing a low and long term variability compatible with bremsstrahlung emission from a hot gas .",
    "for instance , pounds et al .",
    "( 1986 ) showed the existence of a soft x - ray spectral component , distinct from the main ( nuclear ) x - ray emission of ngc 4151 by a lack of variability .",
    "this component is shown to be consistent with thermal emission from a hot , confining medium in the region of the narrow emission - line clouds .",
    "perhaps ngc 4151 is an exception to the general rule that soft x - ray emission from agns is variable , because most of its soft x - ray flux is absorbed by a high intrinsic column density , so that its faint , diffuse x - ray flux can be detected .",
    "this effect should not appear in most objects .",
    "the correlation between the soft x - ray and infrared luminosities in agn has been studied by several authors and is controversial .",
    "one important issue being the source of variability in the various frequency ranges .",
    "in particular , the correlations of ( 0.5 - 4.5 kev ) versus  for the iras 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100 @xmath13 m bands have been examined by green et al .",
    "they claim that  versus l@xmath14  and versus  l@xmath15 resemble very closely the versus l@xmath16 correlation and that the plot of  versus 12  is considerably better defined , yet , just as in the l@xmath17 plot , `` seyfert galaxies still show no significant correlation '' ( green et al . , 1992 , fig .",
    "3 )    on the other hand , the correlation between the 10  and the hard x - ray emission showed opposite results ( carleton et al .",
    "1987 and giuiricin et al . 1994 ) and was reanalysed by giuricin , mardirossian , & mezzetti ( 1995 ) .",
    "they obtained a weak correlation with a harder ( 2 to 10 kev ) x - ray emission , mainly induced by seyfert 2 data .",
    "they also found that the 10  emission correlates well with the 12  and 25 , and less well with the far - infrared emission at 60  and 100 .",
    "these authors favor thermal emission as the origin of the mid - infrared emission of seyfert galaxies .",
    "dust is present in the nlr clouds and re - emission by grains may dominate the ir domain .",
    "if the intense uv - optical central radiation heating the nuclear dust has an x - ray counterpart , a correlation between the infrared and x - ray emission should be expected ( barvainis 1990 ) . because in shocked zones the dust grains are usually heated to higher temperatures than in photoionized regions , the contribution from the shocked nlr clouds",
    "probably dominate the near infrared emission . a contribution to the ir from bremsstrahlung emission from a cooler gas",
    "is not excluded and would result in a correlation between the the soft x - ray and the near ir continua . nevertheless , in the former case the mutual heating of dust and gas ( viegas & contini 1994 ) can also lead to a correlation between those two continua .",
    "therefore , in both cases a correlation is expected .",
    "notice that the contribution of a dusty torus to the ir emission suggested by the agn unified model ( antonucci & miller 1985 ) will give poor or no correlation with the soft x - ray emission as pointed out by green et al.(1992 ) ( see also contini , viegas , & prieto 2003 and references therein ) .    a major problem concerning correlations between x - ray and ir emission is x - ray variability",
    "it is well established that soft x - rays from low luminosity agn ( llagn ) and liners show less and/or longer variability than the hard x - rays ( halderson , moran , & filippenko 2001 , terashima , ho & ptak 2000 ) .",
    "following green et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , we will , therefore , analyse the possible correlation between mid - ir ( 12 ) and x - rays for these galaxies , which present a bolometric luminosity that can be several orders of magnitude lower than the brightest agn .",
    "notice that 10  falls in the absorption trough of the spectral energy distribution due to silicate grains . on the other hand ,",
    "pah emission bands dominate the infrared sed of galaxies at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 , and 12.7  ( spoon et al 2002 ) .",
    "however , pah grains are small compared with silicate grains and easily sputtered in agn , where shock velocities are high enough ( @xmath4 300 ) .",
    "therefore , we refer in this paper to the 12  emission in the mid - ir .",
    "it was found in previous investigations on the seyfert galaxies , ngc 5252 ( contini , prieto , & viegas 1998a ) , circinus ( contini , prieto , & viegas 1998b ) and ngc 4151 ( contini , viegas , & prieto 2002 ) , that the critical shock velocity ( ) to produce dust emission in the mid - ir is of the order of 500  ( viegas & contini 1994 ) , and that the critical  for soft x - ray emission , fitting most of our sample for seyfert 2 galaxies , is about 1000 ( contini & viegas 2000 ) .",
    "however , the dust - to - gas ratio , d / g , may change from galaxy to galaxy , as well as in the different regions of a single galaxy .",
    "therefore a scattering of the infrared data for a sample of galaxies is expected .",
    "the fwhm of the line profiles is lower in liners ( @xmath10 300 ) than in seyfert galaxies ( 300 to 500 ) .",
    "notice , however , that broad  lines have been observed from liners ( ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997 ) , indicating that clouds with higher velocities may also contribute to the spectra .",
    "therefore , in these objects , characterized by a low ionizing flux from the ac , shocks are relatively important and may contribute to both the near - ir and soft x - rays emission . the observed data will be confronted to model results obtained by numerical simulations with the suma code ( viegas & contini 1994 , contini & viegas 2001 ) , which accounts for both the shock and photoionization effects in the nlr clouds .    once tested for the low - luminosity objects , in the second part of this paper we will apply the same kind of analysis to seyfert galaxies .",
    "we will restrict the data to the soft x - ray part of the spectrum , where the variability is not as strong as in the hard x - rays . from the comparison with model results we expect to select those galaxies where the contribution to soft - x rays from the ac prevails , indicating in this way the objects of the sample which should show a higher degree of variability .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of dust and gas emissions obtained from the models , as well as the corresponding temperatures of the dust grains are discussed in sect .",
    "the - 12  correlation for llagn and liners is investigated in sect .",
    "3 , while that for seyfert galaxies is discussed in sect .",
    "4 . concluding remarks appear in sect .",
    "in our model the nuclear clouds are moving outward from the ac .",
    "a shock front appears at the cloud outer edge , while radiation from the ac reaches the inner edge .",
    "the physical conditions of a emitting cloud due to the coupled effect of shock and photoionization by a radiation source are obtained with the suma code assuming a plan - parallel symmetry .",
    "the calculations start at the shocked edge . in the first run ,",
    "only the shock effect is accounted for , and the physical conditions are obtained for several ( @xmath2 300 ) slabs before reaching the opposite edge . in this first run",
    "the results correspond to a shock - dominated model .",
    "iterative runs alternatively start at the photoionized and shocked edges , accounting for both effects , until convergence of the physical conditions in the cloud is achieved .",
    "the input parameters for a single - cloud model are the shock velocity , , the preshock density , 0 , the preshock magnetic field , 0 , the ionizing radiation spectrum , the chemical abundances , the dust - to - gas ratio by number , d / g , and the geometric thickness of the clouds , d. a power - law is adopted for the central ionizing radiation spectrum reaching the cloud , characterized by the flux , at the lyman limit ( in units of @xmath18s@xmath19 ev@xmath19 ) and the power law index @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "for all the models , 0 = @xmath22 gauss , @xmath23 = 1.5 and @xmath24 = 0.4 , and cosmic abundances ( allen 1973 ) are adopted .",
    "the model is either radiation dominated ( rd ) or shock dominated ( sd ) depending on the intensity of the ionizing flux and on the shock velocity ( viegas - aldrovandi & contini 1989 ) . for sd models",
    "the gas entering the shock front is thermalized and heated .",
    "depending on the shock velocity , a high temperature zone can be produced where soft x - rays are generated by bremsstrahlung .",
    "a lower temperature zone may produce near infrared emission by the same mechanism .",
    "the temperature of the photoionized zone is never too high ( @xmath10 4 .",
    "@xmath25 10@xmath26 k ) , thus its bremsstrahlung emission is mainly in the ir - optical range , depending on the intensity of the ionizing radiation .",
    "thermal emission from dust grains could also produce near ir emission , as long as the dust temperature is high enough as discussed below .    before discussing the temperature of the grains ,",
    "let us illustrate the sed of the continuum accounting for both gas bremsstrahlung and dust re - emission calculated by a composite model ( contini & viegas 2000 ) .",
    "the sed shown in fig . 1 correspond to single - cloud models with various cloud velocities and ionizing radiation intensities , assuming a geometric thickness of the cloud d = @xmath27 cm and dust - to - gas ratio d / g = 10@xmath5 by number ( or 4 .",
    "10@xmath28 by mass , adopting silicate grains ) . following the results obtained in our previous papers , models with high velocities ( 1000 ) are sd , because the effect of the shock prevails on photoionization from the ac .",
    "the results shown in fig . 1 will help to understand the soft x - ray emission radiation from clouds in the physical conditions suitable to those in the nlr of agn and in liners .",

    "we assume that grains are present inside the whole cloud before entering the shock front and all the dust grains have initially the same size .",
    "the grain radius may change due to sputtering . a dust - to - gas ratio d / g = 10@xmath5 by number is adopted .    in the photoionized zone",
    ", sputtering is not important and the grain temperature increases with decreasing grain radius and increasing .",
    "the behavior is rather different in the shocked zone because of sputtering throughout the shock front .",
    "the higher  the stronger the sputtering and the higher the grain temperature , as long as the grains survive sputtering .",
    "so , larger grains , which survive sputtering through high velocity shock fronts , show a distribution of different radius throughout the cloud .",
    "they reach higher temperatures and the peak of dust thermal emission shifts toward higher frequencies .",
    "this peak can be high depending on the volume of the dusty region . when the grain initial radius is small and the shock velocity high the dust grains are destroyed by sputtering , so dust can not survive in the sd side of the cloud ( see contini , viegas , & prieto 2003 ) .",
    "moreover there is a mutual heating between gas and dust ( see viegas & contini 1994 ) .",
    "it can be seen that t@xmath29 in the rd zone is always lower than in the sd zone , even for small grains ( = 0.01 @xmath13 m ) and high   ( 5 @xmath30 @xmath31 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "dust is destroyed by sputtering if the initial grain radius is low and is high , as exemplified by the model with = 0.01 @xmath13 m = 1000 .    _ in brief , if the mid - infrared emission of agn , particularly the 12@xmath32  emission , is thermal emission due to grains , the grains must be heated in a shocked zone . _",

    "the choice of the vertical axis is explained below , where we compare the observational data with the results of numerical simulations .",
    "the single - cloud model provides the continuum and emission - line fluxes calculated at the cloud .",
    "thus , in order to obtain the luminosities , the model results must be multiplied by a factor @xmath8 accounting for the emitting area . assuming that the single cloud conditions correspond to the gas around the central source , the emitting area can be related to the distance of the cloud to the central source and to the covering factor ( see , for instance , contini & viegas 2000 ) . plotting a flux ratio versus a luminosity , as in fig .",
    "2 , this factor will affect only the horizontal axis , and the match of the models to the data would be easier , if ir and x - ray emission come from the same cloud and there is a negligible contribution of x - rays from the central source .    since we assume that the soft x - rays come from the shocked edge of the nlr clouds , the post - shocked zone must reach temperatures higher than 10@xmath33 k and a minimum shock velocity of 300  is required .",

    "1 ) . usually in the nlr the decreasing radiation flux with the distance to the ac",
    "is followed by a decreasing velocity field .",
    "moreover , we adopted a low dust - to - gas ratio as a lower limit , in order to find out the whole range of d / g values for both sy1 and sy2 .",
    "the theoretical results are represented by lines , labelled by the input parameters  for sd models ( thin lines ) , and the pair ( , log ) in the case of rd models ( thick lines ) .",
    "short dashed lines refer to dust emission in the ir , while long dashed lines to ir bremsstrahlung .",
    "fitting of the observed correlation with our models is not so simple .",
    "first , recall that models correspond to single clouds ( see sect .",
    "thus , the comparison between the theoretical and observational data can only give a rough indication of the physical conditions of the gas and of the velocity field of the clouds emitting soft x - rays .",
    "second , as already commented above ( sect .",
    "3.1 ) , in order to derive the luminosities , the fluxes calculated by the models must be multiplied by a factor ( @xmath8 ) which represents the fraction of the observed luminosity coming from a specific type of cloud , characterized by , 0 and . if the infrared emission is due to dust , this factor must also account for the differences of the dust - to - gas ratio assumed in the calculations and the real value for each galactic nucleus .",
    "a higher d / g value leads to an enhancement of the l@xmath40 emission .",
    "thus , we expect that the @xmath8 factor is not constant but may have different values for different galaxies .",
    "it could be empirically obtained by fitting the observed emission - line and continuum spectra with a multi - cloud model , as already presented for circinus and ngc 5252 ( contini et al .",
    "1988 b , a ) .",
    "since our goal is to analyse the 12 - correlation we try to obtain a rough picture of the physical processes in the active nuclei with a minimum number of input parameters .",
    "first we constrain the models by considering the main trends shown by the data , because these trends define which type of models must be adopted ( rd , sd , ir from dust or ir from bremsstrahlung ) .",
    "then , we shift the model results in order to cover the largest number of data by changing the @xmath8 factor",
    ".    recall that in the sed presented in fig .",
    "1 , the high frequency domain corresponds to the hot gas emission , i.e. , even in radiation dominated models it depends on the shock velocity .",
    "so , the soft x - ray emission is due to bremsstrahlung in the shocked zone of high velocity clouds while its infrared counterpart can contribute to the mid- or near - ir emission . in this case",
    ", since both continua come from the same cloud , the corresponding @xmath8 should be the same .",
    "the logarithm of @xmath8 for the bremsstrahlung and for dust emission , adopted for modelling the correlations presented in figs .",
    "7 and 8 , are given in tables 3 and 4 for einstein and rosat data , respectively .",
    "in the first column of tables 3 and 4 the type of the galaxy is given .",
    "in the rosat sample , sy1 includes the sy1.5 data .",
    "the model type ( sd or rd ) is indicated in the second column .",
    "the logarithm of the @xmath8 value which provides the best fit of the data by the corresponding model ( see line type in column 8) are given in columns 3 , 4 , and 5 for , 12 generated by bremsstrahlung , and 12  by dust , respectively . in columns 6 and 7",
    "the calculated distance of the emitting clouds from the ac ( assuming a covering factor equal to unity ) and the d / g ratio by number are given , respectively .",
    "the values of d / g by number which better fit the data are calculated from the difference between @xmath8 corresponding to ir(dust ) and @xmath8 corresponding to x - ray for each type of galaxies in tables 3 and 4 .",
    "the line type used to draw the curves corresponding to the models ( figs . 7 and 8) are listed in the last column .",
    "two clear trends are present in fig .",
    "7 ( top panel ) corresponding to the sy1 einstein sample : ( a ) sy1 with @xmath2 3 @xmath25 10@xmath41 show a larger scatter of the 12 values ; ( b ) the objects with higher values are mainly located between rd ( thick short - dashed line ) and sd ( thin short - dashed line ) models both with ir due to dust emission .",
    "the results corresponding to 12 due to bremsstrahlung ( thick long - dashed line ) could eventually explain some sy1 and sy2 data .    regarding the rosat data ( fig .",
    "7 , bottom panel ) , most of the data are also inside a sector defined by rd models ( the low edge ) and sd models ( upper edge ) , as found for the einstein sample .",
    "high 12  sy1 galaxies are better fitted by dust emission from sd models with 300 @xmath10 @xmath2 1000   ( thin line ) , whereas those with low 12 would be dominated by dusty rd clouds with = 10@xmath42 ( @xmath31 ) and  in the range 300 - 500 .",
    "also for the rosat data , the line corresponding to the ir bremsstrahlung emission fits some sy1 and sy2 data , but not the trend of the sy1 complex .",
    "the sample of sy2 is shown in fig . 8 both for einstein ( top panel ) and rosat data ( bottom panel ) . in both samples ,",
    "the data are better explained by rd or sd models with 12 produced by dust thermal emission .",
    "the notation is the same as in fig .",
    "notice that thin short - dash lines refer to sd models and thick short - dash to rd models with ir from dust , while dotted lines correspond to the same models shifted in the diagrams toward higher , in order to explain the high ir luminosity of objects which are rich in dust .",
    "except for four objects in the top panel and three in the bottom panel , most of the data points are located between two sd curves , characterized by log @xmath8 = 40.1 and 43.3 on the other hand , the objects on right of the the sd curves are close to the rd results ( thick short - dash ) with log = 11 ,  between 300 and 500 , and a relatively low d / g ( see tables 3 and 4 ) .              the first results of our investigation show that the x - ray and near - ir correlation for sy1 can be explained by the composite models of clouds producing both bremsstrahlung and dust emission . in the diagrams these models cover most of the area where the agn data points are distributed .    in a photoionized zone",
    ", the dust can not reach a temperature high enough to contribute to the 12@xmath13 m emission , whereas a shocked zone may heat the dust to higher temperatures , as shown in table 1 .",
    "therefore , models accounting for the shock are important . considering the whole sample for a given class ( sy1 or sy2 ) , the contribution of rd and sd clouds to the ir emission coming from thermal emission by dust",
    "provide the best fit to the correlation for both einstein and rosat data .",
    "the values of the factor @xmath8 adopted for the models and presented in tables 3 and 4 give a rough estimation of the distance of the emitting nebula from the ac .",
    "notice , however , that the observed may include a contribution from the central source , while 12 depends on d / g .",
    "so , the @xmath8 value corresponding to 12 due to bremsstrahlung , which is related to the distance of the cloud to the ac , can be lower than that corresponding to .",
    "the ratio of @xmath8 for and 12 will provide an estimate of the emitted from the ac relative to emitted by bremsstrahlung .",
    "for example , the observational data ( einstein sample ) for the sy1 galaxy mrk 335 , could be reproduced by ir from dust with a high d / g .",
    "however , it could be also reproduced by ir produced by bremsstrahlung , with log@xmath43=43.7 and log@xmath44=43.6 . a difference in the @xmath8 values showing log@xmath43 higher than log@xmath44 indicates a contribution from the ac to . in this case",
    ", this galaxy could show soft x - ray short term variability .",
    "the theoretical results shown in figs . 7 and 8",
    "correspond to models with d / g = @xmath45 . with a lower d / g",
    ", 12 dust will hardly prevail over 12 bremsstrahlung , therefore , also in the case of emission by dust we assume as indicative of the nebula radius the lowest value of @xmath8 .",
    "the sy2 galaxies included between the thin short - dash and dotted curves of fig .",
    "8 have a d / g between 2.5 10@xmath46 and 1.6 10@xmath47 ( einstein ) and between 1.6 10@xmath46 and 10@xmath47 ( rosat ) .",
    "the results for the sy1 galaxies indicate d / g = 2.5 10@xmath7 - 1.3 10@xmath5 ( einstein ) and 5 .",
    "10@xmath7 - 10@xmath5 ( rosat ) .    regarding the objects with ir coming from dust re - radiation , results obtained for the galaxies of both einstein and rosat samples , we obtain from the values of @xmath8 listed in tables 3 and 4 a characteristic distance of a few hundred pc to a few kpc for the sy1 .",
    "the distances for sy2 galaxies are smaller going from a few pc to about 500 pc .    in brief , the results obtained by the modelling the - 12 correlation suggest that both sd and rd clouds are present in sy1 and sy2 .",
    "notice , however , that for sy2 galaxies ,  is about 300 and log  is of the order of 11 , while sy1 have higher  ( up to 600 ) and higher  ( log up to 12 ) .",
    "clouds closer to the nuclear region are shock dominated because a large amount of dust can prevent the ionizing radiation from the ac .",
    "high velocity ( = 1000 ) and dust rich sd clouds are more likely to be present in sy2 than in sy1 , and are closer to the center .",
    "this indicates that the emitting region in sy2 is more compact than in sy1 .",
    "however , the maximum distance of a few kpc obtained for sy1 from the fit of the rosat sample could represent an upper limit if the emitting gas has both a high d / g and a strong contribution to the x - ray coming from the active nucleus .",
    "schmitt et al . ( 2003 ) found that both seyfert types have similar distributions of the nlr sizes , although it is expected that sy1 have in average smaller nlr sizes than sy2 ( mulchaey et al 1996 ) .",
    "notice that schmitt et al claim that there are `` effects which could alter both the measurements and models '' .",
    "finally , the results obtained from the ensemble of the seyfert galaxies reveal that the x - ray - near - ir emitting regions of sy1 and sy2 have indeed different characteristics , which are hardly noticeable when modelling single objects .",
    "in this paper we looked for new evidences for differences in parameter ranges characterizing the nlr of sy1 , sy2 , and liners ( and llagn ) by modelling of the - 12 correlation by composite models accounting for dust emission .",
    "soft x - rays are considered because they show less dramatic variability . in our models ,",
    "soft x - ray are emitted in the post - shock region of clouds with relatively high shock velocities .",
    "dust and gas are coupled crossing the shock front , therefore , dust emission from the cloud region that emits the soft x - rays peaks in the mid - ir .",
    "shocks are relatively important in modelling the llagn spectra , so , we have started our investigation with the - correlation for llagn .",
    "the results are sensitive enough to apply the same modelling method to seyfert galaxies .",
    "we found that shock velocities are between 300 and 1000 for all the objects , lower in llagn and seyfert 2 , higher in the nlr of seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "the intensity of the flux from the ac is low for liners and llagn ( log = 9 - 10 ) and increases towards sy2 ( log @xmath48 11 ) , being higher for sy1 ( log @xmath312 ) .",
    "results obtained by modelling the einstein sample and the rosat sample are in full agreement .",
    "dust - to - gas ratios by number are larger than 10@xmath5 ( 4",
    ". 10@xmath28 by mass ) for liners and llagn , between 10@xmath5 and 3 @xmath25 10@xmath7 ( 4 .",
    "10@xmath28 and 0.012 by mass ) for sy1 , and reach 2 .",
    "@xmath25 10@xmath47 ( 0.8 by mass ) for sy2 .",
    "the soft x - ray variability of seyfert galaxies can be inferred from the @xmath8 values deduced from the models . if ( @xmath9 @xmath10 ( @xmath11 there is a strong contribution of soft x - rays from the ac to the observed value .",
    "therefore , objects of the sample used in this paper which could present strong variability can be identified .",
