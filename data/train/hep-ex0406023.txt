    "the kek - to - kamioka long - baseline neutrino experiment ( k2k)@xcite started taking data in 1999 . an almost pure muon neutrino beam with average energy of 1.3  gev is produced with the kek 12-gev proton synchrotron and directed toward the super - kamiokande detector ( sk ) located at kamioka , 250  km away from kek .",
    "the neutrino flux and energy spectrum at sk is estimated from the flux measured by near detectors located 300  m downstream from the production target .",
    "the number of events and the spectral shape at sk are compared with the expectations to study neutrino oscillations .",
    "the latest k2k results@xcite indicate neutrino oscillation , and are consistent with the sk results@xcite . in k2k , the neutrino energy at the oscillation maximum",
    "is expected to be @xmath00.6  gev .",
    "a new near detector , scibar ( @xmath1ntillator @xmath2 ) , was constructed in summer 2003 to upgrade the near detectors .",
    "a main motivation of the new detector is to improve the measurement of neutrino energy spectrum by using charged current quasi elastic interaction ( ccqe , @xmath3 ) . in order to select ccqe interaction with high purity and high efficiency and to suppress other interactions such as inelastic interactions with pions ( @xmath4 ) ,",
    "the detector is designed to have high efficiency for all charged particles produced in the interaction .",
    "the detector consists of plastic scintillator strips with fine segmentation .",
    "the scintillator itself is a neutrino target and has no dead region . due to the fine segmentation of the detector , short tracks down to 10",
    "cm long can be detected .",
    "the detector also has a capability of particle identification ( especially for protons and pions ) with de / dx information by measuring the energy deposit in each strip .    in addition",
    ", we expect to provide many new results for neutrino interactions in the 1  gev region with scibar .",
    "figure  [ fig : scibar ] shows a schematic view of scibar .",
    "scibar consists of two components : a tracking calorimeter made of scintillator strips and an electromagnetic calorimeter called electron catcher .",
    "table [ table : structure ] shows the design for each component .",
    "the scibar tracker consists of 14848 extruded scintillator strips with each dimension of 1.3@xmath52.5@xmath5300  @xmath6 .",
    "the scintillator strips are arranged in 64 layers .",
    "each layer consists of two planes , with 116 strips glued together to give horizontal and vertical position .",
    "the total size and weight are 2.9@xmath52.9@xmath51.7  m@xmath7 and 15  tons , respectively .",
    "each strip is read out by a wavelength shifting ( wls ) fiber attached to a 64-channel multi - anode pmt ( mapmt ) . charge and timing",
    "information from mapmt is recorded by custom designed electronics@xcite .",
    "two outermost strips in each horizontal and vertical planes are called as outer detector ( od ) . for the od readout , eight 1-ch pmts with wls fibers",
    "are used to identify incoming and outgoing events .",
    "the scintillator strips are made of polystyrene , infused with ppo ( 1  % ) and popop ( 0.03  % ) , and are produced by extrusion in the shape of rectangular bar with tio@xmath8 reflecting coating ( 0.25  mm thickness ) .",
    "scintillators are produced at fnal and the composition of the material is the same as those used for the minos experiment@xcite .",
    "each scintillator has a 1.8  mm diameter hole where the 1.5  mm@xmath9 wls fiber is inserted for light collection .",
    "the fiber is multi - clad type , y11(200)ms , made by kuraray .",
    "the attenuation lengths of all wls fibers were measured before the installation .",
    "their average is 350  cm .",
    "mapmt is h8804 made by hamamatsu photonics k.k .. it s anodes are arranged in an 8 @xmath5 8 array with each anode measuring 2 mm @xmath5 2 mm .",
    "the sensitive wave length is from 300  nm to 650  nm , which matches the emission spectrum of the wls fibers .",
    "the cross talk value in our configuration is less than 4 % .",
    "the gains of all channels have been measured before installation .",
    "the linearity is also measured to be 10  % upto 300  photo - electrons  ( p.e . ) with the gain of @xmath10 .",
    "readout system consists of frontend electronics attached to mapmt and a backend vme module .",
    "a combination of asics ( va32hdr11 and ta32cg made by ideas ) is used on the frontend readout electronics .",
    "va is a 32-ch preamplifier chip with shaper and multiplexer .",
    "ta provides timing information after taking or of 32 channels .",
    "two packages of va / ta are mounted on a custom - designed pcb board ( front - end board , feb ) to read out signals from 64 anodes .",
    "a backend electronics board ( daqb ) has been also newly developed as a standard vme-9u board .",
    "daqb controls and reads out eight febs .",
    "the charge information from mapmt is digitized with a 12-bit flash adc and read out through vme bus .",
    "the timing information is processed and recorded by a tdc .",
    "we use a 64-ch , multi - hit tdc developed for atlas muon chamber . in order to separate of protons from pions by the energy deposit",
    ", the wide dynamic range is required for the readout system .",
    "the system is designed to have a good linearity up to 300  p.e . , corresponding to 30  mev , while the pedestal width is 2 adc counts , corresponding to 0.03 mev .",
    "electron catcher ( ec ) is located downstream of the tracker .",
    "it is used to measure the @xmath11 contamination in the beam and @xmath12 production events .",
    "the ec is a calorimeter consists of two planes of 30 ( horizontal ) and 32 ( vertical ) modules ( 4 @xmath5 8 @xmath5 262  @xmath6 ) re - used from the chorus experiment@xcite .",

    "energy resolution is @xmath14(gev )  % with linearity better than 10  % .",
    "the ec is used for electron and photon identification and the measurement of their energy .",
    "scibar is taking data since october 2003 .",
    "pedestal , led and cosmic - ray data are taken simultaneously with beam data for calibration and monitoring . the gain is monitored and corrected by led , so the energy deposit is measured within a stability better than 1 % by the gain correction . by using cosmic - ray data the attenuation length of wls fibers are measured as shown in fig .",

    "the average attenuation length is 350  cm which is consistent with the measurement before installation .",
