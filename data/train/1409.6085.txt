    "first - principles molecular dynamics ( fpmd ) based on density functional theory ( dft ) is a well - established and highly - successful tool for studying reactions or processes of materials at the atomic scale . due to the increase of the computer power ,",
    "the variety and complexity of the materials and phenomena investigated by fpmd simulations have been growing . however , the size of the systems modelled with fpmd simulations have remained limited to systems of a few hundred atoms in most cases , because the computational cost of standard dft methods grow rapidly , proportional to the cube of the number of atoms @xmath0 in the system .",
    "there are many demands to enlarge the system size in diverse fields , including computational physics , chemistry , materials science , biology and so on .",
    "examples of these problems include chemical reactions at liquid / solid interfaces , various processes in complex biological systems , or the growth mechanism of the nano - structured materials at atomic scale ; in all these cases , we have to treat systems containing many thousands or tens of thousands of atoms . in this respect , recent advances in developing linear - scaling or o(@xmath0 ) methods are encouraging@xcite .",
    "there have been several demonstrations that efficient and reliable linear - scaling dft calculations are now available to calculate the electronic structure , total energy and atomic forces of very large systems , including up to millions of atoms@xcite .",
    "although it is now possible to calculate the total energy and atomic forces of very large systems using o(@xmath0 ) dft methods@xcite , this does not guarantee that stable , efficient and accurate fpmd simulations are possible in practice@xcite . with conventional dft methods , there are two widely - used methods to achieve efficient fpmd simulations .",
    "the first method is known as car - parrinello md ( cpmd)@xcite , where the propagation of electronic structure and the atomic positions are treated simultaneously by introducing a fictitious mass for the electronic degree of freedom .",
    "this method is efficient , but the accuracy of the cpmd simulations can depend on the choice of the fictitious mass .",
    "by contrast , born - oppenheimer md ( bomd ) deals with the electronic and nuclear problems separately . in this method ,",
    "the electronic structure in the ground state is calculated at each set of atomic positions , usually by the optimization of the kohn - sham orbitals using an iterative method@xcite .",
    "the bomd method thus needs more cpu time than cpmd for each md step , but the method is robust and stable , and allows us to adopt a longer time step . as a result ,",
    "the cpu time needed for a whole md simulation is tractable because the number of force calculations is smaller ( the cost of calculating atomic forces is usually much higher than the update of the kohn - sham orbitals ) .",
    "the main problem facing this method , however , is that both the stability and the reliability of the md depend on the accuracy of the calculated forces . if the optimization of the kohn - sham orbitals or the convergence of scf is not sufficiently accurate , the method suffers from a systematic energy drift in micro - canonical md simulations , due to the violation of time - reversal symmetry",
    "this can also result in poor reliability for canonical md simulations .",
    "recently this problem has been solved using the extended lagrangian born - oppenheimer md ( xl - bomd ) proposed by niklasson et al.@xcite , whose lagrangian includes auxiliary electronic degrees of freedom as dynamical variables to recover time - reversal symmetry in bomd simulations . they have shown that bomd simulations with long - term conservation of total energy are possible .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that this recent progress with the xl - bomd method could be used with o(@xmath0 ) dft techniques .",
    "however , since linear - scaling methods rely on the locality of the electronic structure and need to introduce approximations to utilize this locality , the accuracy of o(@xmath0 ) method may change during the md simulations , and it is not clear how accurate or stable md can be with o(@xmath0 ) dft methods .",
    "although there have been already a few reports showing the examples of o(@xmath0 ) fpmd@xcite or o(@xmath0 ) self - consistent tight - binding@xcite simulations , they use different linear scaling techniques and the information about the accuracy , stability or efficiency of the simulations is rather limited . in this paper , we report the stability and accuracy of the xl - bomd simulations with a density matrix minimization ( dmm ) technique@xcite , which is one of the most common o(@xmath0 ) dft methods .",
    "the accuracy of the forces calculated by the dmm method is high because the method satisfies the variational principle@xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", the combination of dmm and xl - bomd methods has not been investigated so far . since the original xl - bomd methods assume the orthogonality of the basis functions , the formulation of the method for non - orthogonal basis functions is also presented .",
    "we show that the xl - bomd method can be introduced to our linear - scaling dft code conquest@xcite , and report that robust , accurate and efficient fpmd is possible with the dmm method .",
    "the reliable calculation conditions for the accurate o(@xmath0 ) fpmd are also investigated . in the end , we demonstrate that it is now possible to do actual fpmd simulations of a 32,768-atom system .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we show the methods and algorithms which are used or introduced in this work . in sec . 3 , we report the results of the test calculations , investigation of the reliable calculation conditions , and some examples of the fpmd simulations , including that of 32,768-atom system . finally , concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "the implementation of molecular dynamics and all calculations were performed with , which is a linear scaling , pseudopotential dft code@xcite . in order to achieve linear - scaling both in computational time and memory consumption",
    ", the code works with the density matrix @xmath1 rather than the wavefunctions , because of its spatial locality : @xmath2  assumes that the density matrix can be described in a separable form : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a non - orthogonal localised orbital called a _ support function _ , which is only non - zero within a sphere centred at atom @xmath5 , and @xmath6 denotes the support functions of a given atom .",
    "support functions are represented in terms of localised basis functions ; in  we can use systematically improvable basis functions ( b - splines@xcite ) or pseudoatomic - orbitals ( paos)@xcite .",
    "@xmath7 is the density matrix represented in terms of the support functions .",
    "we find the electronic ground state by minimising the total energy with respect to the density matrix , while imposing the correct electron number and weak idempotency .",
    "the complete minimisation combines two algorithms@xcite : mcweeny s iterative purification@xcite ; and the auxiliary density matrix ( adm ) method proposed by li , nunes and vanderbilt@xcite .",
    "an initial density matrix is generated starting from the hamiltonian ( scaled to have the right trace and eigenvalue spectrum ) , using the extension of mcweeny s approach for the canonical case@xcite .    in the adm method ,",
    "weak idempotenty is imposed by expressing the density matrix @xmath8 in terms of an auxiliary density matrix @xmath9 , and the overlap @xmath10 between support functions , @xmath11 , as @xmath12 the spatial truncation on the density matrix is actually imposed on the matrix @xmath9 , such that @xmath13 once @xmath14 ; this is referred as _ l - range _ in the rest of this report .",
    "the mcweeny s procedure is applied until the energy rises ( a sign of reaching truncation error@xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath9 matrix is then passed into the adm , which is a variational approach , using a modified pulay / broyden algorithm .",
    "this part of the minimisation is referred to as dmm ( density matrix minimisation ) .",
    "+ in this paper , we represent each support function @xmath15 in terms of one pao ( the approach given here is easily extended to the case where we also minimise the energy with respect to the paos , which will be presented in a future publication ) . in running bomd simulations with the dmm method",
    ", we have two ways to optimize the electronic structure .",
    "one is to initialise the density matrix using mcweeny s procedure at every atom movement .",
    "the initial charge density is made from the superposition of the atomic charge density .",
    "since the hamiltonian and overlap matrices are recalculated after the movement of atoms , the initial matrix @xmath9 and subsequent optimised @xmath9 matrix will maintain time - reversal symmetry ; we hence expect that bomd simulations should conserve energy and be stable .",
    "the other method is to utilize the auxiliary density matrix found from the previous md step to start the present dmm . in this case , the initial charge density is made from the initial density matrix @xmath9 prepared for the present dmm , and is updated with the @xmath9 matrix simultaneously during the dmm .",
    "this method will be more efficient , but will break time reversal symmetry , potentially leading to unphysical energy drift .    to maintain time - reversal symmetry while keeping the efficiency of density matrix re - use , we will use the extended lagrangian scheme proposed by niklasson et al.@xcite we introduce an auxiliary degree of freedom to the born - oppenheimer lagrangian @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "this is associated with @xmath18 , rather than @xmath9 to maintain the correct non - orthogonal metric@xcite .",
    "@xmath19 -          \\frac{\\mu}{2 } { \\rm tr}\\left [ \\dot{x}^2 \\right ] -          % \\frac{\\mu \\omega^2}{2 } \\text{tr}\\left [ \\left ( ls   - x \\right)^2 \\right ]          \\frac{\\mu \\omega^2}{2 } { \\rm tr}\\left [ \\left ( ls   - x \\right)^2 \\right ]    \\label{eq : xlbomd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath17 is a sparse matrix with the range of the matrix @xmath18 , @xmath20 the fictitious electronic mass , and @xmath21 is the curvature of the electronic harmonic potential . as in the original xl - bomd method , if we take the limit @xmath22 , @xmath16 becomes @xmath23 and we have equations of motion for nuclear positions and @xmath17 .",
    "if we apply the time - reversible verlet scheme to calculate @xmath17 using the equation of motion , we have @xmath24 which shows that @xmath25 is time reversible and evolves in a harmonic potential centered around the ground - state @xmath26 .",
    "this also implies that a good initial guess for the @xmath9-matrix , which will obey time reversal symmetry , can be calculated by multiplying @xmath17 and @xmath27 ( in , the sparse approximate inverse @xmath10 is computed using hotelling s method@xcite ) .",
    "even though the time - reversibility is maintained during propagation , the @xmath17-matrix tends to move away from the harmonic centre over time . as a result ,",
    "the number of iterations to reach the ground state at each md step gradually increases in the course of a simulation .",
    "to remove accumulated numerical errors , we add a dissipative force to the propagation of @xmath17 following ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath28 here , the parameters @xmath29 , @xmath6 and @xmath30 are determined so that the dissipation term does not significantly break the time - reversal symmetry ; we use the values in ref .",
    "the amount of dissipation is controlled with a single parameter @xmath31 , which determines the order of the polynomial , and we use @xmath32 in this paper . with the dissipation term , we can keep the kinetic energy of @xmath33 small and thus the @xmath25 is kept close to the present ground - state @xmath26 . as a result , we expect that the number of dmm steps would be reduced .",
    "the effect of the dissipation term in the practical calculations is reported and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : effect - schem - line ] .",
    "we will present our tests of the implementation of o(@xmath0 ) dft in different stages : first , considering approaches that permit energy conservation and their efficiencies ; second , the effect of density matrix range and minimisation tolerance ; and finally presenting practical calculations .",
    "first , we explore methods to achieve energy conservation with o(@xmath0 ) dft and bomd .",
    "we monitor the born - oppenheimer total energy @xmath34 , which is defined as a sum of the ionic kinetic energy @xmath35 and the dft total energy @xmath36 . in the micro - canonical ensemble ,",
    "@xmath34 should be constant and so is a good indicator to judge whether a simulation is accurately carried out . in what follows ,",
    "@xmath37 is set to 16 bohr ( the effect of changing this is explored below in sec .",
    "[ sec : calc - cond - bmmathc ] ) .",
    "a single-@xmath38 ( sz ) pao is used to represent support functions@xcite , and the local density approximation ( lda ) is adopted to the exchange - correlation functional with the parametrization by perdew and zunger@xcite .",
    "md simulations are conducted via the velocity - verlet integrator@xcite with a time step being 0.5 femtoseconds ( fs ) in a micro - canonical ensemble ; the initial velocities are given randomly so that the maxwell - boltzmann distribution holds with 300 k. the same conditions are set in other simulations in this report unless otherwise specified .",
    "for a first run , we perform bomd on a 64-atom crystalline silicon with density - matrix initialisation by mcweeny step , so that the density matrix is initialised from the hamiltonian at each md step .",
    "the density matrix is updated until the residual in the dmm step , @xmath39 with @xmath40 , becomes smaller than a given tolerance @xmath41 .",
    "here , @xmath42 is defined as @xmath43 , the number of electrons is @xmath44 and the lagrange multiplier @xmath20 is used to keep the electron number fixed .",
    "the profile of the born - oppenheimer energy @xmath34 is shown by a solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : eprofiles1 ] , and it is clear that the total energy is conserved even for a low dmm tolerance , @xmath45 .",
    "this simulation is , however , time - consuming since the electronic structure is calculated from scratch at every atom movement .",
    "we now consider the re - use of the optimised @xmath9-matrix from the previous md step . when the optimised @xmath9-matrix from the previous step is used to initialise the density matrix , the cpu time is significantly reduced .",
    "however , as well as this improved efficiency , we observe a significant and undesired energy drift , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eprofiles1 ] with symbols . here",
    ", we consider various values for the tolerance applied to the density matrix minimisation , @xmath41 .",
    "the energy drift can be reduced by using a tighter @xmath41 , but tighter tolerance rapidly increases the number of dmm iterations and the computational cost .    in order to solve the problem of both accuracy and efficiency , we carry out xl - bomd with a dmm tolerance , @xmath45 .",
    "its @xmath34 profile ( crosses in fig .  [",
    "fig : eprofiles2 ] ) agrees extremely well with that of bomd with density - matrix initialisation by means of mcweeny step ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : eprofiles2 ] ) , implying that xl - bomd yields a well conserved energy with lower computational requirements . however , there is a problem in the efficiency with the method , as explained in sec .",
    "2 . after a long simulation time , the number of dmm iterations required to find the ground state density matrix grows .",
    "this growing cost can be suppressed by applying a dissipative force , and the resulting @xmath34 profile , circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : eprofiles2 ] , is still very close to the profile without dissipation .",
    "a comparison of the required number of dmm iterations at each step for these different approaches is shown in table .",

    "the reduction of computational cost by using xl - bomd with dissipation is significant . besides the smaller number of dmm iterations ,",

    "averages taken over 1,000 steps . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      in the last section , we showed that xl - bomd simulation with dmm method was robust and efficient using one typical set of calculation conditions .",
    "we now investigate how md results are affected by the parameters which control the accuracy and efficiency of linear - scaling dft calculations with dmm .",
    "there are two key parameters : the range applied to the auxiliary density matrix ( @xmath9-range or @xmath49 ) ; and the tolerance applied to the minimisation , @xmath41 . in both tests ,",
    "xl - bomd is performed on a 64-atom crystalline silicon with a dissipative force .",
    "the key approximation made in linear scaling is to localize the density matrix , and it is vital to examine how the conservation of energy , @xmath50 , is affected by the range , the parameter @xmath49 . we have tested three values of @xmath49 : 13 , 16 and 20 bohr , each with a strict dmm tolerance , @xmath51 .",
    "simulations are performed for 2ps ( or 4,000 steps ) .",
    "the time - averaged bo total energies are very different for the three ranges ( -106.830 ev / atom , -106.930 ev / atom and -106.987 ev / atom ) simply because the potential energy is lower for longer ranges .",

    "given the fast convergence in ionic kinetic energy , and the similarities in @xmath50 profiles , the calculated trajectories will be very close .",

    "this plot demonstrates excellent energy conservation , though there are large fluctuations for the first few femtoseconds .",
    "this initial large amplitude is probably caused by the system not being in an equilibrium state at the start of the simulation , and is not a significant problem . in the inset of fig .",

    "it is encouraging that we can use such a large time step for o(@xmath0 ) fpmd simulations . here , we should note that a new efficient method which does not require self - consistent field optimization has been recently proposed@xcite within the xl - bomd framework . introducing such new techniques to the conquest code may even further accelerate the speed of o(@xmath0 ) fpmd simulations .",
    "we take a box of water made up of 32 molecules as our next target .",
    "water is important as a system in its own right , as well as forming the environment for most biological simulations .",

    "as a demonstration of the scalability of our approach , we apply our algorithm to a large system : a 32,768 atom crystalline silicon sample .",
    "the time evolution of the bo and potential energy are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : si32768 ] .",
    "this is our first substantial attempt to examine the stability of an md simulation on massive systems .",

    "this gives excellent energy conservation even with a rather rough tolerance on the convergence of the density matrix minimisation .",
    "however , this method requires considerable computational time because it initialises the density matrix at each step , rather than re - utilising it .",
    "direct re - use of the optimised density matrix reduces computational costs considerably , but causes an unphysical energy drift . in order to achieve both accuracy and efficiency ,",
    "we have introduced the xl - bomd formalism , proposed by niklasson et al .",

    "the application of xl - bomd turned out to be much more efficient than the mcweeny approach , especially with the aid of a dissipative force , and good energy conservation was observed .",

    "<S> the recent progress of linear - scaling or o(@xmath0 ) methods in the density functional theory ( dft ) is remarkable . given this , we might expect that first - principles molecular dynamics ( fpmd ) simulations based on dft could treat more realistic and complex systems using the o(@xmath0 ) technique . </S>",
    "<S> however , very few examples of o(@xmath0 ) fpmd simulations exist so far and the information for the accuracy or reliability of the simulations is very limited . in this paper , we show that efficient and robust o(@xmath0 ) fpmd simulations are now possible by the combination of the extended lagrangian born - oppenheimer molecular dynamics method , which was recently proposed by niklasson _ et al _ ( _ phys </S>",
