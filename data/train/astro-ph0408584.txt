    "rays only for short intervals lasting a few months ( outbursts ) followed by quiescent periods of years .    during quiescence",
    "lmxb transients are very faint in x  rays ( 5 - 6 orders of magnitude less than in outburst ) usually with luminosities of @xmath2 .",
    "transient systems , therefore , represent a unique laboratory for the study of compact objects in accretion regimes that are inaccessible to persistent sources .",
    "most neutron star transients are characterized by a quiescent x  ray spectrum consisting of a soft component , usually ascribed to the cooling neutron star which has been heated during outbursts ( brown et al .",
    "1998 ; rutledge et al .",
    "1999 ) , and a hard power - law tail ( with photon index @xmath3 ) the nature of which is still debated ( campana & stella 2000 ) .",
    "several mechanisms have been put forward to explain these spectral components , ranging from accretion disks ( in different flavours such as advection - dominated or convection - dominated disks , disks stopping at the magnetosphere , etc . ;",
    "narayan et al .",
    "1997 ; blandford & begelman 1999 ; igumenshchev et al .",
    "2003 ) to emission from the interaction between the relativistic wind from a re - activated radio pulsar with matter outflowing from the companion star ( stella et al . 1994 ; campana et al . 1998b ) .",
    "xmm - newton carried out the first detailed study of sax j1808.43658 in quiescence : sax j1808.43658 was dimmer than any other neutron star transient ( with a 0.510 kev luminosity of @xmath4 at a distance of 2.5 kpc , int zand et al .",
    "2001 ) and exhibited only a hard power - law component ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 confidence level ) in its quiescent x  ray spectrum ( campana et al . 2002 ) .",
    "these results were confirmed by a subsequent xmm - newton observation ( wijnands 2002 ) .    in the optical ,",
    "sax j1808.43658 is dim during quiescence ( mean @xmath7 ; homer et al .",
    "2001 ) and brightens considerably in outbursts ( @xmath8 ; wang et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the optical light curve in outburst and quiescence is modulated at the orbital period and it is in anti - phase with the x  ray light curve , likely indicating that irradiation of the companion star plays a crucial role in spite of the low x  ray luminosity .",
    "this is unlike other quiescent transients .",
    "the mass function derived from x  ray data ( @xmath9 , chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ) and the requirement that the companion fills its roche lobe led to the conclusion that it must be a rather low mass star , possibly a brown dwarf ( bildsten & chakabarty 2001 ) . a white dwarf companion is ruled out because it would not fill its roche lobe .",
    "homer et al . ( 2001 ) proposed that the bulk of the optical emission in quiescence arises from the internal energy release of a remnant disc and the orbital modulation from the varying contribution of the heated face of the companion star .",
    "burderi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) noted that the required irradiating luminosity needed to match the optical flux , however , is a factor @xmath10 higher than the quiescent x  ray luminosity of sax j1808.43658 .",
    "these authors proposed an alternative scenario , in which the irradiation is due to the rotational energy emitted in the form of a relativistic particle wind from the fast spinning neutron star , which switched to the rotation - powered regime during quiescence .",
    "their results are in agreement with the weak constraints from the optical magnitudes by homer et al .",
    "here we present indirect evidence for an active radio pulsar in sax j1808.43658 during quiescence with the first optical spectra and @xmath11 band photometry of sax j1808.43658 .",
    "these data were obtained with the eso - vlt ( ut4 yepun ) during two half nights on july 12 - 13 2002 .",
    "we carried out @xmath11 band photometry with 3 min exposures with fors2 ( pixel size of @xmath12/pixel and a field of view of @xmath13 ) over one orbital period .",
    "spectroscopy of the same target was performed using the low resolution grism 600ri ( centered at 6780  with a resolution of 55 / mm ) covering 51208450and a @xmath14 slit with 3 min spectra over four orbital periods .",
    "data reduction was done in midas to remove the bias level , flat - field .",
    "the region around the optical companion of sax j1808.43658 is crowded and poor seeing conditions complicated the analysis ( varying between @xmath15 ) . we take advantage of previous eso - vlt images ( obtained during quiescence in 1999 with seeing @xmath16 ) to de - blend our data ( these magnitudes were @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) . our @xmath11 photometry shows a dimmer source ( @xmath20 ) and a clear modulation at the 2.01 hr orbital period with a semi - amplitude @xmath21 mag ( @xmath22 in flux , fig .",
    "we also re - calculated the modulation semi - amplitude in @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) using the homer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) data .",
    "the @xmath11-band light curve shows a clear maximum at phase @xmath27 and a single minimum at phase @xmath28 ( based on the precise x  ray ephemerides chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ) .",
    "this is a clear indication of emission from an irradiated companion ( e.g. charles & coe 2004 ) and it argues against emission from the impact point between the gas stream from the companion and an accretion disk ( the hot spot ) since this has maximum at phase @xmath29 .",
    "we obtained spectra at 3-min intervals over four orbital periods .",
    "we selected spectra taken with seeing better than @xmath30 ( due to poor seeing conditions ) , collecting a total of 51 min of good data .",
    "wavelength calibrations used hearne arc lamp observations .",
    "second - order flexure effects were corrected using night - sky emission lines .",
    "this correction was always @xmath31 .",
    "spectra were corrected for slit - losses according to diego ( 1985 ) .",
    "we also account for the contaminating stars , estimating their relative contribution in a @xmath14 slit on the good - seeing vlt images and interpolating to the spectral range .",
    "errors were tracked along these processes resulting in a 0.1 mag error .",
    "a weak h@xmath32 emission line is visible in the spectrum ( equivalent width @xmath33 , @xmath34 confidence level , and @xmath35 , see insert in fig .",
    "we first checked that at the time of our observations the source was in quiescence .",
    "a rossi x  ray timing explorer ( rxte ) pointed observation , performed 15 days before the optical observations , provided a @xmath36 upper limit of @xmath37 ( 0.510 kev ) .",
    "similar limits are provided by the galactic bulge scan carried out with rxte ( nearest observation on jul 10 , 2002 ; swank et al .",
    "while these limits are not particularly constraining , they are sufficient to exclude that the source was in outburst ( note that an outburst started three months later wijnands et al .",
    "2003 ) .    since sax j1808.43658 was in quiescence ,",
    "what is the cause of the optical emission ?",
    "likely candidates are emission from the companion star and/or the disk . in order to fit within the roche lobe of a 2.01",
    "hr binary the companion mass has to be less than @xmath38 . in the model of bildsten & chakrabarty ( 2001 )",
    "the most likely companion is a @xmath39 brown dwarf bloated by irradiation to fill its roche lobe ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the maximum intrinsic optical luminosity from the companion for any of the models by bildsten & chakrabarty ( 2001 ) is @xmath41 ( corresponding to a star temperature of 4800 k for a distance of 2.5 kpc ) .",
    "this is too low a luminosity to account for the observed optical flux , which is a factor of @xmath42 brighter .",
    "we therefore turn to the accretion disk as a possible source . assuming that the quiescent x  ray luminosity is powered by accretion we can infer the expected mass inflow rate and derive the corresponding optical luminosity ( including irradiation ) , which fails to account for what we see by more than a factor of 100 .",
    "disk models may be envisaged with a much higher mass accretion rate together with a truncation radius ( fine ) tuned to avoid optical and soft x ",
    "ray violation of observed data . however , this kind of models still require some additional ingredient to explain the large optical phase modulation . the emission from the pulsar",
    "could itself extend to the optical and extrapolation of the power law x  ray flux ( assuming the xmm - newton observation found the x ",
    "rays in a similar state ) could account for about @xmath43 of the optical luminosity .",
    "but this also could not explain the observed orbital phase modulation .",
    "it is instructive to compare the properties of sax j1808.43658 with those of the _ black widow _ pulsar psr b1957 + 20 ( fruchter et al . 1988 ) , which consists of a 1.6 ms radio pulsar irradiating its white dwarf companion ( orbital period of 9.16 hr ) with a rotational energy of @xmath44 .",
    "x- and @xmath45-rays are generated in an inter - binary shock front , which causes ablation and heating of the companion ( phynney et al .",
    "1988 ; arons & tavani 1994 ) . an x  ray nebula has recently been revealed around psr b1957 + 20 confirming this scenario ( stappers et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the orbital modulation is large with an @xmath25-band semi - amplitude @xmath46 mag ( callanan et al .",
    "a similar system is the eclipsing millisecond radio pulsar psr j20510827 , consisting of a 4.5 ms pulsar orbiting its very low mass companion ( @xmath47 ) every 2.4 hr ( stappers et al .",
    "radio eclipses as well as a @xmath48 mag optical modulation have been observed in psr j20510827 ( stappers et al .",
    "2001 ) , however no x  ray observations are available .    inspired by this analogy and following burderi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we now attempt to account for the optical and x  ray spectra ( even if not close in time ) as well as the @xmath23 , @xmath25 and @xmath11 modulations of sax j1808.43658 with an irradiated star plus the contribution of the shock front .",
    "we fit the data by using the irradiating luminosity ( @xmath49 ) , the fractional luminosity difference between the heated and the cold face of the companion ( @xmath50 ) and interstellar absorption ( @xmath51 ) as free parameters ( e.g. chakrabarty 1998 ) .",
    "we obtain a good fit to all the available data ( reduced @xmath52 with 57 degrees of freedom , a factor of 10 higher than psr 1957 + 20 ( stappers et al .",
    "2003 ) , as expected due to geometrical reasons . ] , see fig .",
    "1 ) . in particular , the required irradiating luminosity is @xmath53 ( @xmath6 confidence level for three free parameters , i.e. @xmath54 ) .",
    "the best fit fraction is @xmath55 resulting in temperature difference at the two faces of the companion star of about @xmath56 k. this temperature difference is similar to the one observed in psr j20510827 .",
    "the amplitude modulation of sax j1808.43658 is instead smaller than in the case of psr j20510827 and psr b1957 + 20 .",
    "this could be due to some remaining contamination due to our de - blending process , or it could be an inclination effect .",
    "for the most strongly modulated psr j1957 + 20 , the inclination is @xmath57 .",
    "psr j20510827 has an inclination of @xmath58 .",
    "the estimated absorption is @xmath59 , in line with previous estimates .",
    "optical emission from the shock front accounts for about @xmath60 of the total emission cm ) . ] . in the fit we assumed that all the irradiating luminosity is re - emitted by the star .",
    "therefore the irradiating luminosity we derived represents only a lower limit since a relativistic particle wind could have rather different effects from those of x  ray irradiation in terms of effective albedo .",
    "moreover , we note that evidence of this large irradiating luminosity comes from the equivalent width of the @xmath61 line .",
    "if the line comes from reprocessing , one can roughly infer an irradiating luminosity of @xmath62 .",
    "this can be estimated by taking the line flux and increasing it by the fraction of emitted flux intercepted by the star ( @xmath63 , with @xmath64 the companion star radius taken equal to the roche lobe radius and @xmath65 the orbital separation ) and by the fraction of energy re - emitted in @xmath61 ( e.g. hynes et al .",
    "here we assumed a conservative value of 0.3 ( see the discussion in hynes et al .",
    "the required irradiating luminosity is in all cases large ( @xmath66 ) , indeed much larger than the observed x ",
    "ray luminosity in quiescence ; neither accretion - driven x rays , nor the intrinsic luminosity of the companion star or disk are able to account for it ( see also burderi et al .",
    "the only source of energy available within the system is then the rotational energy of the neutron star . in order to have such a large spin - down luminosity",
    "one needs a neutron star magnetic field @xmath67 g ( the companion star albedo might be larger than zero and the neutron star emission may also be partially beamed ; this value is smaller than the one estimated by burderi et al .",
    "2003 , since they did not account for the contamination from nearby stars ) .",
    "the required magnetic field is well in the range inferred from x  ray observations during the outbursts ( see above ) .",
    "prospects for directly observing sax j1808.43658 pulsing in the x  ray band are rather hard since with xmm - newton we collected less than 300 counts in 30 ks ( campana et al .",
    "2002 ) . given the crowding around sax j1808.43658 in the optical band , it would be difficult to detect an @xmath61 nebula like that around psr b1957 + 20 .",
    "on the other hand a search in the radio band looking for a millisecond radio pulsar would require searches at high frequencies to overcome the effects of free - free absorption ( campana et al .",
