    "the analysis of dynamic processes taking place in complex networks is a major research area with a wide range of applications in social , biological , and technological systems @xcite .",
    "the spread of information in online social networks , the evolution of an epidemic outbreak in human contact networks , and the dynamics of cascading failures in the electrical grid are relevant examples of these processes .",
    "while major advances have been made in this field , most modeling and analysis techniques are specifically tailored to study dynamic processes taking place in static networks .",
    "however , empirical observations in social @xcite , biological @xcite , and financial networks @xcite illustrate how real - world networks are constantly evolving over time @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the effects of temporal structural variations in the dynamics of networked systems remain poorly understood .    in the context of temporal networks , we are specially interested in the interplay between the dynamics on networks ( i.e. , the dynamics of processes taking place in the network ) and the dynamics of networks ( i.e. , the temporal evolution of the network structure ) . although the dynamics on and of networks are usually studied separately , there are many cases in which the evolution of the network structure is heavily influenced by the dynamics of processes taking place in the network .",
    "one of such cases is found in the context of epidemiology , since healthy individuals tend to avoid contact with infected individuals in order to protect themselves against the disease  a phenomenon called _ social distancing",
    "_  @xcite . as a consequence of social distancing",
    ", the structure of the network adapts to the dynamics of the epidemics taking place in the network .",
    "similar adaptation mechanisms have been studied in the context of power networks  @xcite , biological and neural networks  @xcite and on - line social networks  @xcite .    despite the relevance of network adaptation mechanisms , their effects on the network dynamics are not well understood . in this research direction , we find the seminal work by gross et al .  in @xcite , where a simple adaptive rewiring mechanism was proposed in the context of epidemic models . in this model , a susceptible node can cut edges connecting him to infected neighbors and form new links to _ any _ randomly selected susceptible nodes  without structural constraint in the formation of new links . despite its simplicity",
    ", this adaptation mechanism induces a complex bifurcation diagram including healthy , oscillatory , bistable , and endemic epidemic states @xcite .",
    "several extensions of this work can be found in the literature  @xcite , where the authors assume homogeneous infection and recovery rates in the network .",
    "another model that is specially relevant to our work is the adaptive susceptible - infected - susceptible ( asis ) model proposed in  @xcite . in this model , edges in a given contact network can be temporarily removed in order to prevent the spread of the epidemic .",
    "an interesting feature of the asis model is that , in contrast with gross model , it is able to account for arbitrary contact patterns , since links are constrained to be part of a given contact graph . despite its modeling flexibility ,",
    "analytical results for the asis model  @xcite are based on the assumption of homogeneous contact patterns ( i.e. , the contact graph is complete ) , as well as homogeneous node and edge dynamics ( i.e. , nodes present the same infection and recovery rates , and edges share the same adaptation rates ) .    as a consequence of the lack of tools to analyze network adaptation mechanisms ,",
    "there is also an absence of effective methodologies for actively utilizing adaptation mechanisms for containing spreading processes .",
    "although we find in the literature a few attempts in this direction , most of them rely on extensive numerical simulations  @xcite , on assuming a homogeneous contact patterns @xcite , or a homogeneous node and edge dynamics  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , while controlling epidemic processes over static networks , we find a plethora of tools based on game theory  @xcite or convex optimization  @xcite .    in this paper , we study adaptation mechanisms over arbitrary contact networks .",
    "in particular , we derive an explicit expression for a lower bound on the epidemic threshold of the asis model for arbitrary networks , as well as heterogeneous node and edge dynamics . in the case of homogeneous node and edge dynamics",
    ", we show that the lower bound is proportional to the epidemic threshold of the standard sis model over a static network @xcite . furthermore , based on our results ,",
    "we propose an efficient algorithm for optimally tuning the adaptation rates of an arbitrary network in order to eradicate an epidemic outbreak in the asis model .",
    "we confirm the tightness of the proposed lower bonds with several numerical simulations and compare our optimal adaptation rates with popular centrality measures .",
    "in this section , we describe the adaptive susceptible - infected - susceptible ( asis ) model over _ arbitrary _ networks with _ heterogeneous _ node and edge dynamics ( heterogeneous asis model for short ) .",
    "we start our exposition by considering a spreading process over a time - varying contact graph  @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the set of nodes and @xmath2 is the time - varying set of edges . for any @xmath3",
    ", @xmath4_{i , j}$ ] corresponds to the adjacency matrix of @xmath5 , and the neighborhood of node  @xmath6 at time @xmath7 is defined as @xmath8 . in the standard sis epidemic model ,",
    "the state of node @xmath6 at time @xmath7 is described by a bernoulli random variable @xmath9 , where node  @xmath6 is said to be _ susceptible _ if @xmath10 , and _ infected _ if @xmath11 .",
    "when the contact graph evolves over time , the evolution of @xmath12 is described by a markov process with the following transition probabilities : @xmath13[.8\\linewidth ] { p}(x_i(t+h ) = 1 \\mid x_i(t ) = 0 ) = \\beta_i\\ \\sum_{\\mathclap{k \\in { \\pazocal{n}}_i(t)}}\\ x_k(t)\\,h + o(h ) , \\end{multlined } \\nonumber   \\\\ & { p}(x_i(t+h ) = 0 \\mid x_i(t ) = 1 ) = \\delta_i h + o(h ) ,   \\label{eq : recovery}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are called the _ infection _ and _ recovery _ rates of node  @xmath6 .    in the heterogeneous asis model ,",
    "the epidemics takes place over a time - varying network that we model as a continuous - time stochastic graph process  @xmath16 , described below .",
    "let @xmath17 be an initial connected contact graph with adjacency matrix  @xmath18_{i , j}$ ] .",
    "we assume that @xmath19 is strongly connected .",
    "edges in the initial graph @xmath19 appear and disappear over time according to the following markov processes : @xmath13[.9\\linewidth ] { p}(a_{ij}(t+h ) = 0 \\mid a_{ij}(t ) = 1)=\\vspace{.1 cm } \\\\",

    "notice that the transition rate in depends on @xmath12 and @xmath22 , inducing an adaptation mechanism of the network structure to the state of the epidemics .",
    "the transition probability in   can be interpreted as a protection mechanism in which edge @xmath23 is stochastically removed from the network if either node @xmath6 or @xmath24 is infected . more specifically , because of the first summand ( respectively , the second summand ) in , whenever node @xmath6 ( respectively , node @xmath24 ) is infected , edge  @xmath25 is removed from the network according to a poisson process with rate  @xmath26 ( respectively , rate  @xmath27 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the transition probability in describes a mechanism for which a ` cut ' edge @xmath25 is ` reconnected ' into the network according to a poisson process with rate @xmath28 ( see figure  [ fig : adaptive ] ) .",
    "notice that we include the term @xmath29 in to guarantee that only edges present in the initial contact graph @xmath19 can be added later on by the reconnecting process .",
    "in other words , we constrain the set of edges in the adaptive network to be a part of the arbitrary contact graph @xmath19 .",
    "in this section , we derive a lower bound on the epidemic threshold for the heterogeneous asis model . for @xmath30 , let @xmath31 denote a poisson counter with rate  @xmath32 @xcite . in what follows , we assume all poisson counters to be stochastically independent .",

    "the upper bound is tight around the origin , since both @xmath82 and @xmath83 consist of higher - order terms . from",
    ", we conclude that the epidemics dies out exponentially fast in the heterogeneous asis model if @xmath84 where @xmath85 is defined as the maximum among the real parts of the eigenvalues of @xmath79 . furthermore",
    ", since @xmath79 is a metzler matrix ( i.e. , has nonnegative off - diagonals ) and irreducible , there is a real eigenvalue of @xmath79 equal to  @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "in the homogeneous case , where all the nodes share the same infection rate @xmath86 and recovery rate  @xmath87 , and all the edges share the same cutting rate  @xmath88 and reconnecting rate  @xmath89 , the condition   reduces to the following inequality : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the spectral radius of the initial graph @xmath19 and @xmath92 which we call the _ effective cutting rate_. the proof of the extinction condition is given in appendix  [ appx : pf : thm : stbl : homo ] .",
    "we remark that , in the special case when the network does not adapt to the prevalence of infection , i.e. , when @xmath93 , we have that @xmath94 and , therefore , the condition in   is identical to the extinction condition  @xmath95 corresponding to the homogeneous networked sis model over a static network  @xcite .",
    "it is worth comparing the condition in with the epidemic threshold @xmath96 given in @xcite for the case in which @xmath19 is the complete graph : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the link - creating rate , @xmath99 is the link - breaking rate , and @xmath100 is a positive and `` slowly varying '' function depending on the metastable long - time average of the number of infected nodes ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "we first notice that our lower bound in can be checked directly from the parameters of the model , namely , the adjacency matrix of the initial graph @xmath19 and the relevant rates of the model .",
    "this is in contrast with the threshold in  , since it depends on the metastable average of the number of infected nodes and , thus , can only be computed via numerical simulations .",
    "we also remark that the lower bound on the epidemic threshold in and the epidemic threshold in both exhibit affine dependence on the effective link - breaking rates  @xmath101 and  @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "finally , we see that the recovery rate @xmath103 appears in different places in the two conditions , namely , inside the expression of @xmath101 in and inside the function  @xmath100 in .",
    "however , the consequences of this difference are not obvious , since @xmath100 is defined via the metastable state and , therefore , does not allow an analytical investigation .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     once the cost functions are selected , we must solve the problem of finding the optimal tuning investment to achieve a desired exponential decay rate in the probabilities of infection . from the inequality in ,",
    "the infection probabilities @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 decay exponentially at a rate ( at least ) @xmath107 if @xmath108 since @xmath79 is an irreducible and metzler matrix , we can use perron - frobenius theory  @xcite to prove that is satisfied if there exists an entry - wise positive vector  @xmath109 satisfying the following entry - wise vector inequality ( see @xcite for more details ) : @xmath110 therefore , problem  [ prb : ] can be reduced to the following equivalent optimization problem : @xmath111 as we show in appendix  [ appx : gp ] , we can equivalently transform this optimization problem into a geometric program  @xcite , which can be efficiently solved using standard optimization software .",
    "the computational complexity of solving the resulting geometric program is @xmath112 , where @xmath70 is the number of nodes and @xmath66 is the number of edges in the initial network @xmath19 .    in the rest of this section ,",
    "we compute the optimal tuning profiles for three different graphs and compare our results with several network centralities . in our simulations , we consider the following three graphs with @xmath113 nodes : _ 1 _ ) an erds - rnyi graph with @xmath114 edges , _ 2 _ ) a barabsi - albert random graph with @xmath115 edges , and _ 3 _ ) a social subgraph ( obtained from facebook ) with @xmath116 edges . for simplicity in our simulations , we assume that all nodes share the same recovery rate  @xmath117 and infection rate @xmath118 , where @xmath91 denotes the spectral radius of each initial graph . since @xmath119 , the extinction condition indicates that the infection process does not necessarily die out without adaptation , i.e. , when @xmath120 .",
    "the rest of parameters in our simulations are set as follows : we let @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 . also , the parameters in the cost functions are @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the desired exponential decay rate is chosen to be @xmath126 .    using this set of parameters , we solve the optimization problem   following the procedure described in appendix  [ appx : gp ] .",

    "we observe how both degree - based and eigenvector - based edge - centralities are good measures for determining the amount of investment in tuning cutting rates .",

    "we observe how edges of low centrality require no investment , while for higher - centrality edges , the tuning investment tends to increase affinely as the centrality of the edge increases  as expected .",
    "for the real social network in row c ) , the relationship between investment and centralities is still strong  although not as clear as in synthetic networks . in the scatter plot corresponding to the relationship between the optimal investment and the eigenvector - based centrality in the real social network ( lower center figure in table [ table : ] ) , we observe a collection of several stratified parallel lines .",
    "we conjecture that each line corresponds to a different community inside the social network ; in other words , the relationship between centrality and optimal investment is almost affine inside each community .",
    "we have studied an _ adaptive _ susceptible - infected - susceptible ( asis ) model with heterogeneous node and edge dynamics and arbitrary network topologies .",
    "we have derived an explicit expression for a lower bound on the epidemic threshold of this model in terms of the maximum real eigenvalue of a matrix that depends explicitly on the network topology and the parameters of the model . for networks with homogeneous node and edge dynamics , the lower",
    "bound turns out to be a constant multiple of the epidemic threshold in the standard sis model over static networks ( in particular , the inverse of the spectral radius ) .",
    "furthermore , based on our results , we have proposed an optimization framework to find the cost - optimal adaptation rates in order to eradicate the epidemics .",

    "we say that a real function  @xmath192 is a _ monomial _ if there exist @xmath193 and @xmath194 such that @xmath195 .",
    "also , we say that a function  @xmath196 is a _ posynomial _ if it is a sum of monomials of  @xmath197 ( we point the readers to  @xcite for more details ) . given a collection of posynomials @xmath198 , @xmath105 , @xmath199 and monomials @xmath200",
    ", @xmath105 , @xmath201 , the optimization problem @xmath202 is called a _ geometric program_. a constraint of the form @xmath203 with @xmath196 being a posynomial is called a posynomial constraint .",
    "although geometric programs are not convex , they can be efficiently converted into equivalent convex optimization problems  @xcite .    in the following , we rewrite the optimization problem   into a geometric program using the new variables @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "by , these variables should satisfy the constraints @xmath206 also , using these variables , the cost function @xmath207 can be written as @xmath208 , where @xmath209 are posynomials . in order to rewrite the constraint  ,",
    "we first define the matrices @xmath210 we also introduce the positive constants @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 . now ,",
    "adding @xmath214 to both sides of , we equivalently obtain @xmath215 where @xmath216 is given by      summarizing , we have shown that the optimization problem   is equivalent to the following optimization problem with ( entry - wise ) positive variables : @xmath218 in this optimization problem , the objective function is a posynomial in the variables @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 .",
    "also , the box constraints , , and can be written as posynomial constraints  @xcite .",
    "finally , since each entry of the matrix @xmath222 is a posynomial in the variables @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and  @xmath221 , the vector - constraint yields @xmath139 posynomial constraints .",
    "therefore , the optimization problem is a geometric program , as desired .",
    "furthremore , a standard estimate on the computational complexity of solving geometric program ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  3 ) ) shows that the computational complexity of solving the optimization problem in is given by @xmath112 .",
    "finally we remark that @xmath222 contains both the terms  @xmath28 and @xmath223 so that we can not use @xmath28 as the decision variable in the geometric program   due to the positivity constraint on decision variables . by this reason , we can not design the reconnecting rates @xmath28 under the framework presented in this paper .",
    "this issue is left as an open problem ."
