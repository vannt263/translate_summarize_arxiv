    "the coolest and lowest mass objects have historically been discovered as companions to low - luminosity stars .",
    "these objects include the two lowest luminosity spectral classes of low mass stars and brown dwarfs - the l and t dwarfs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) .",
    "the first l dwarf , gd165b , was discovered as the companion to a white dwarf @xcite while the first widely accepted brown dwarf , gliese229b , was the companion to an m dwarf @xcite .",
    "hence it is quite possible that the first of the ultracool brown dwarfs with effective temperatures less than @xmath2700k will also be discovered as a companion .",
    "these objects would likely populate a new spectral type beyond t with masses overlapping the planetary regime .",
    "the hunt today for even cooler objects benefits from advances in high resolution imaging with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) and large ground - based telescopes fitted with adaptive optics ( ao ) . with the spectral energy distributions of these cool objects peaking in the near - infrared ( 1 - 6 ) , observing at these wavelengths are advantageous for their detection and characterization .",
    "thus observational strategies have relied on targetting continuously lower luminosity objects to further improve the contrast differential obtained in the near - infrared .",
    "an advantage in using ao over the hst is that they can be attached to larger ground - based telescopes attaining higher angular resolution and increased sensitivity to fainter sources .",
    "the challenge , however , exists in locating natural guide stars sufficiently bright ( @xmath313.5mag , @xmath412mag ) and near one s science target ( isoplanatic angular distance @xmath530@xmath0 ) to provide sufficient wavefront correction . there is less than 10% chance of finding a natural guide star ( ngs ) meeting these requirements at 30galactic latitude @xcite .",
    "the probability improves little even with the use of infrared wavefront sensors when targeting ultracool objects such as mid - l dwarfs ( limiting magnitude of the ngs infrared wavefront sensor on naos at the very large telescope is @xmath612mag ) .",
    "slightly better ngs sensitivity performance has been achieved using curvature wavefront sensors with avalanche photodiodes where @xmath412.3mag @xcite .",
    "the search for substellar and planetary - mass objects through direct detection from ground - based telescopes now has a new technique - laser guide stars ( lgss ) .",
    "lgss serve as artificial beacons for ao systems by exciting sodium atoms in the earth s mesosphere at their resonant d - line frequency .",
    "these beacons serve as artificial ( and steerable ) guide stars which provide sufficient flux density for wavefront sensing and correcting .",
    "while lgs ao still requires a ngs to help correct both the lowest wavefront orders ( `` tip / tilt '' , @xmath22khz ) and the higher orders ( `` low - band wavefront sensor '' , @xmath20.01hz ) , its flux density requirement is comparatively small ( @xmath718mag ) .",
    "this results in @xmath22/3 of the night sky accessible to high spatial resolution imaging @xcite and opens the door to probing the regions around ultracool l and t dwarfs never previously observed by ground - based telescopes .",

    "since there is no known trigonometric parallax for the object , we rely on first estimating the component spectral types to derive absolute magnitudes using an empirical relation .",

    "the better constrained the component spectral types are , the more constrained ( and meaningful ) will the derived physical properties be .",
    "the component near - infrared colors listed in table [ tbl-2 ] by themselves provide only rough constraint on the individual spectral types ( eg . * ? ? ?",

    "the secondary could even be a t dwarf without the characteristic ch@xmath26 bands appearing in the combined light spectrum .    to derive more precise estimates of the individual component spectral types , we used a spectral synthesis technique based on that used by @xcite to study l dwarf plus t dwarf binaries .",
    "a large sample of composite spectra were generated by combining various pairings of l5-t6 spex prism spectra obtained by a.  burgasser & k.  cruz ( 72 individual spectra in all ) .",

    "the best matches between the composite spectra and the observed ( unresolved ) spectrum of 2m2132 + 1341ab were quantitatively determined by comparing both relative @xmath14 and @xmath15 magnitudes and h@xmath24o and ch@xmath26 spectral ratios ( defined in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "no assumption was made on the absolute magnitudes of the individual components in this analysis so that the absolute magnitude / spectral type scale was left as a free parameter .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] illustrates the three best - fit composite spectra based on both the relative magnitudes and spectral ratio comparisons . in all three cases ,",
    "an l5 spectral classification is selected for the primary along with an l7 or l8 for the secondary .",
    "in fact , this was the case for the best twenty fits . while the uncertainty is dominated by one subclass of uncertainties in the individual library spectral classifications , the consistency in the matches likely average out the overall uncertainty .",
    "hence we conclude that the primary is a likely l5@xmath10.5 and its companion a likely l7.5@xmath10.5 .",
    "the fourth fit shown in figure [ fig2 ] ( bottom right ) shows one of the combinations that was disqualified due to the disparity between the predicted and measured @xmath27 magnitudes .",

    "resolved near - infrared spectroscopy is required to verify the accuracy of these classifications .",
    "are the components of 2m2132 + 1341ab physical companions ? calculating spectrophotometric distances of the two sources separately results in equal values , 28@xmath14pc .",

    "in addition , the system s tangential motion of 53@xmath12kms@xmath43 ( nomad ; * ? ? ? * ) is inconsistent with a young object ( @xmath51gyr ) .    the lack of lithium absorption in the optical spectrum can help place a lower mass limit to 2m2132 + 1341a of approximately 0.065m@xmath41 depending on the system s age @xcite .",
    "objects less than this limiting mass will always have central temperatures below the lithium - burning temperature .",
    "slightly more massive objects will undergo lithium burning such that the element is observable at only younger ages .",
    "for example , using the models of @xcite , a 0.075m@xmath41 object will undergo complete lithium burning in about 140myr . in figure [ fig3 ]",

    "<S> we present the discovery of 2massj21321145 + 1341584ab as a closely separated ( 0.066@xmath0 ) very low - mass field dwarf binary resolved in the near - infrared by the keck ii telescope using laser guide star adaptive optics . </S>",
    "<S> physical association is deduced from the angular proximity of the components and constraints on their common proper motion . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained a near - infrared spectrum of the binary and find that it is best described by an l5@xmath10.5 primary and an l7.5@xmath10.5 secondary . </S>",
    "<S> model - dependent masses predict that the two components straddle the hydrogen burning limit threshold with the primary likely stellar and the secondary likely substellar . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of this sytem - close projected separation ( 1.8@xmath10.3au ) and near unity mass ratio - are consistent with previous results for very low - mass field binaries . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively short estimated orbital period of this system ( @xmath27 - 12yr ) makes it a good target for dynamical mass measurements . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the system s angular separation is the tightest yet for any very low - mass binary published from a ground - based telescope and is the tightest binary discovered with laser guide star adaptive optics to date . </S>"
