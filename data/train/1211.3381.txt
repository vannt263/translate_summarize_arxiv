    "gauge theories are quite important to physics .",
    "one example of this importance is their use as the basis of the standard model .",
    "their development is based in the idea of freedom of choice of basis vectors at different space time points .",
    "this concept was introduced by yang , mills , @xcite . for isospin space along with the requirement that physical interactions be independent of any choice .    in gauge theories ,",
    "these ideas are applied to other properties of systems besides isospin .",
    "matter fields , @xmath17 are described as taking values in separate vector spaces , @xmath0 , at each space time point , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "unitary operators , @xmath18 as elements of a gauge group , connect @xmath0 to @xmath19 they map vectors in @xmath0 to vectors in @xmath19    mathematically , the definition of vector spaces includes an underlying scalar field of real or complex numbers . in the usual setup , this is taken care of by using just one set of complex numbers , @xmath2 , as the common scalar field for the different vector spaces .",
    "this setup raises the question regarding why one should use separate vector spaces for each space time point but just one complex number structure for all points .",
    "this is relevant because complex numbers are part of the definition of vector spaces as used in gauge theories .",
    "this work continues earlier work @xcite in the investigation of the expansion of the usual setup by assigning separate complex number structures , @xmath20 to each point @xmath21 in this case @xmath3 is the scalar number field for @xmath22 the different complex number structures can be related to one another by the use of parallel transform operators @xcite .",
    "these correspond to or define the notion of same number value between the different complex number structures .",
    "restriction of the maps between the different number structure to parallel transform operators , corresponds in gauge theory to restricting the gauge group to the identity map .",
    "there would be no freedom of choice of basis vectors among the different vector spaces . here",
    "the freedom of choice of basis vectors in the vector spaces is extended to the underlying complex number structures by including a freedom of choice of scaling factors that relate numbers in one structure to those in another .",
    "this is achieved by expanding the parallel transform maps to include space time dependent scaling factors .",
    "this extension was developed in earlier work @xcite by first expanding the gauge group @xmath23 to @xmath24 the real part of @xmath25 appears in gauge theory lagrangians as a scalar boson field , @xmath26 that interacts very weakly with matter fields .",
    "this description of gauge theories with separate vector spaces and complex number structures at each point @xmath1 was expanded by considering a basic model of physics and mathematics in which separate mathematical structures of many different types are associated with each space time point .",
    "included are the different types of numbers , vector spaces , algebras , etc .",
    "any mathematical system type that is based on numbers is included .",
    "it was also assumed that `` mathematics is local '' in that the mathematics available to an observer @xmath7 at @xmath1 is limited to the structures at @xmath21    the effect of scaling induced by the boson field @xmath4 on some aspects of physics was investigated .",
    "it was seen that in a local region , including us as observers , scaling has not been observed experimentally .",
    "it follows that the effect of @xmath27 must be below experimental error in the local region .",
    "however these experimental restrictions do not apply to values of @xmath4 at cosmological distances or for very large structures .",
    "since the earlier work is used in the new material presented here , it is summarized in the first sections , [ gt]-[rt ] , of this paper .",
    "some new material is also included .",
    "section [ gt ] summarizes the expansion of gauge theories to include the freedom of number scaling .",
    "section [ bm ] describes the basic model with separate number and other mathematical structures associated to each point of a space and time manifold .",
    "the effects of @xmath4 induced scaling on quantum physics are summarized .",
    "new material is described on the effect of scaling on the equations of motion of a classical system .",
    "section [ rt ] describes the restrictions on the space and time dependence of @xmath15 in a region , @xmath10 , in which it is possible for us as observers , to carry out experiments on systems . here",
    "@xmath10 is arbitrarily chosen to be a region of space of radius about 1 light year centered on the solar systems .",
    "the size of @xmath10 is not important .",
    "however it should be a very small fraction of the whole universe .",
    "most of the new work is in sections [ etg ] and [ eetg ] .",
    "some effects of @xmath4 induced scaling on the geometric properties of space and time are described .",
    "section [ etg ] describes the effects on line elements , curve lengths , and distances between points .",
    "it is seen that for local entities at a point , such as the line element @xmath28 at @xmath1 , scaling arises in the transfer of the description of @xmath28 at @xmath1 , to any other point @xmath9 , such as the location of an observer . scaling between @xmath1 and @xmath9",
    "is present because @xmath28 is an infinitesimal number value in @xmath29 but the representation of @xmath28 at @xmath9 is an infinitesimal number value in @xmath30 this scaling can be removed by letting @xmath31 be the reference point . for quantities such as curve lengths that are described by integrals over space and/or time",
    ", a space and/or time dependent scaling factor occurs inside the integral .",
    "this scaling can not be removed by changing the reference point .",
    "some examples of the effects of @xmath4 induced scaling on geometric properties are discussed in section [ eetg ] . in one simple example",
    ", @xmath32 is assumed to depend on the time , @xmath14 , only and not on space .",
    "then the dependence of @xmath33 on time determines the time rate of change of line elements , curve lengths and distances between points at all locations in the universe .",
    "if @xmath34 , then line elements , curve lengths , and distances all expand as time increases .",
    "if the expansion rate accelerates , then the change in these geometric properties has some similarity to the accelerated expansion of space ascribed to dark energy @xcite . if @xmath35 , then line elements , curve lengths , and distances all contract as time increases .",
    "other examples illustrate the effects of singularities in the values of scaling . in these @xmath36",
    "is assumed to be time independent and spherically symmetric about some point @xmath16 @xmath37 is the radial unscaled distance from @xmath38 to some point @xmath21 let @xmath9 be a point on the extension of the radius vector from @xmath38 to @xmath21 if @xmath39 as @xmath40 , then the scaled distance from @xmath9 to @xmath1 increases to infinity as @xmath41 if @xmath42 as @xmath40 , then the scaled distance from @xmath9 to @xmath1 approaches a finite limit or barrier in that it is less than the unscaled distance from @xmath9 to @xmath38 .",
    "these properties are shown in detail for specific examples where @xmath43 and either @xmath44 or @xmath45 the case @xmath44 is called a `` scaling black hole '' because the scaled distance from @xmath9 to @xmath1 increases without bound as @xmath1 approaches @xmath16 the case @xmath46 is referred to as a `` scaling white hole '' because the scaled distance approaches a barrier as @xmath41    following a brief summary section , the final conclusion section emphasizes some important aspects of this work .",
    "included are brief discussions of the notion of sameness and of the fact that scaling refers to all mathematical quantities , independent of their possible representation of physical systems .",
    "the need to explore possible connections , if any , between @xmath4 and other scalar fields discussed in physics is noted .",
    "as noted , the usual setup for gauge theories begins with the assignment of separate @xmath47 dimensional vector spaces , @xmath0 , to each space time point @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "matter fields , @xmath48 , take values in @xmath0 for each @xmath21 let @xmath49 be a neighbor point of @xmath21 let @xmath50 be a unitary operator in the gauge group @xmath51    @xmath52 is usually represented in terms of a phase , @xmath53 and elements of the lie algebra @xmath54 @xcite as@xmath55 where@xmath56 here @xmath57 is an @xmath1 dependent real number , @xmath58 is a coupling constant , and @xmath59 is a generator of @xmath60    there is a mathematical problem here .",
    "this representation of the action of @xmath52 on @xmath48 is a vector in @xmath22 it is not a vector in @xmath19    this problem can be easily fixed by factoring @xmath52 into two unitary operators as in @xmath61 in this case @xmath52 becomes a parallel transformation map from @xmath62 onto @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "with this definition @xmath52 defines , or corresponds to , the notion of `` sameness '' between @xmath0 and @xmath19 @xmath64 is the same vector in @xmath63 as @xmath48 is in @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the same vector in @xmath0 as @xmath67 is in @xmath19    as a map from @xmath0 onto @xmath65 the representation of @xmath68 with @xmath69 replacing @xmath52 in eq , [ uyx ] , is valid .",

[ uzw ] give @xmath72and @xmath73as is the case for @xmath18 the unitary operator @xmath74 has no representation either as a matrix of numbers or in terms of lie algebra elements .",
    "the distinction between @xmath52 and @xmath69 does not appear to be mentioned in the usual treatment of gauge theories .",
    "the possible reason is that it makes no difference in the results .",
    "however , this distinction is important for this work .      in the usual setup of gauge theories",
    "there is just one complex number field of scalars associated with each @xmath0 . here",
    "this is expanded by the association of separate complex number structures @xmath3 with @xmath0 for each @xmath21 the couple @xmath75 is assigned to each point @xmath1 rather than the couple @xmath76 this expansion is shown in figure [ ens1 ] .    as was the case for the vector spaces ,",

    "these @xmath37 dependent representations emphasize the fact that the elements of the base sets in the structures have no inherent number values outside of a number structure .",
    "they acquire values inside a structure only .",

    "@xmath131 is the same number value in @xmath110 as @xmath79 is in @xmath82    this structure dependence of the values assigned to elements of @xmath99 is why the term `` number values '' is used instead of just `` numbers '' .",

    "there are several aspects of the effect of the boson field , @xmath231 on physics and geometry that should be noted .",
    "one aspect is the appearance and emphasis on the notion of `` sameness '' .",
    "this shows up in gauge theories where the unitary operator , @xmath18 in eq .",
    "[ uzw ] , defines or describes the meaning of `` same vector '' between two points .",
    "this is different from the usual treatment of gauge theories where the notion of `` same vector '' does not appear if one represents @xmath52 using generators of a lie algebra . however , as was noted , this is not correct mathematically .",
    "the concept of `` sameness '' also plays an important role in the basic model used here with separate mathematical structures associated with different space time points .",
    "the parallel transformation operators , @xmath621 eq . [ fyx ] , for numbers and unitary operators , @xmath18 eq .",
    "[ uzw ] , for vector spaces describe or correspond to this concept .",
    "if @xmath79 is a number value in the complex number structure , @xmath3 , then @xmath80 is the same number value in @xmath81 as @xmath79 is in @xmath82 if @xmath144 is a vector in the vector space , @xmath65 then @xmath622 is the same vector in @xmath63 as @xmath144 is in @xmath22    as far as the definitions of parallel transforms @xcite are concerned , it makes no difference here whether the notion of `` sameness '' is assumed a priori and the operators @xmath98 and @xmath52 are required to preserve it , or the choice of the operators defines the notion of `` sameness '' between mathematical structures . here the concept of sameness or same value is taken for granted , and it makes no difference whether `` sameness '' or parallel transformation operators are taken to be a priori .",
    "the concept of `` sameness '' or `` same value '' provides a reference point or base for the description and meaning of scaling between structures at different points .",
    "as was noted earlier in this work , the model assumption of separate mathematical structures at each space time point , with parallel transform operators between structures , and no scaling , gives the same mathematics and physical theory predictions as does the usual mathematical setup .",
    "this shows that separate mathematical structures at each point , with an appropriate notion of sameness and no scaling , is completely equivalent to the usual treatment of mathematics and its use in physics .",
    "the possibility that one might be able to dispense with the concept of sameness or parallel transformation and treat these and scaling together as emergent concepts is an open question .",
    "probably the main question to consider is what physical field , if any , does @xmath4 represent .",
    "the appearance of @xmath4 as a scalar boson field with very weak coupling to matter fields in gauge theory helps , but it does not answer this question .",
    "the fact that there is no evidence of the presence of @xmath4 on physics in a local region , @xmath10 , section [ rt ] , restricts the effects of @xmath4 to cosmological regions .",
    "if @xmath4 has any observable or predictable consequences , they would show up over very large regions of space and time .",
    "it is interesting to note that there are many suggestions in the literature for the role that scalar fields have in physics @xcite .",
    "many are attempts to explain dark energy @xcite . some include modification of gravity by including a scalar field @xcite .",
    "others use scalar fields to describe a space and time varying cosmological constant , @xmath623 quintessence is one example that has been much studied @xcite .",
    "other examples of scalar fields in physics include the inflaton to describe inflation in cosmology @xcite , the higgs boson @xcite , and supersymmetric partners of spin @xmath624 fermions @xcite .    at present",
    "it is not known if the field , @xmath231 described in this work , corresponds to any of these physical fields .",
    "these examples do show that there are many possibilities .",
    "it is also possible that @xmath4 combines mathematics and physics together in a manner that is different from that of corresponding to any of the existing fields .",
    "one potentially desirable approach would be to consider the maps , with scaling between two number structures as single maps instead of their description as products of two maps , a parallel transformation followed by a scaling . in this approach",
    ", the concept of `` same number as '' and the representation of the map as a product of two maps would be an emergent property .",
    "it is clear from these considerations that there is much to do in order to tie the model considered here more closely to physics , if it is possible to do so .",
    "in addition , more needs to be done to determine if physics makes use of the @xmath4 field . in any case",
    "one should keep in mind that , for the model considered here with separate mathematical structures at each space and time point , the scaling factors and parallel transformations provide mappings between these mathematical structures and their elements .",
    "they apply to numbers and other mathematical entities independent of whether the entities represent physical quantities or have nothing to do with physics .",
    "however , as has been seen , their effect on physical quantities , especially those represented by derivatives or integrals over space and time , can be appreciable .",
    "in this work the assignment of separate vector spaces to each space time point in gauge theories was expanded to assign separate complex number structures to each point .",
    "the freedom of choice of bases in the vector spaces was expanded to include freedom of choice of scaling for the complex scalars .",
    "use of this with the requirement that lagrangians be invariant under local gauge transformations , resulted in the presence of a boson field , @xmath231 whose mass is optional and interaction with matter fields is very weak .    the second part of the paper explores a basic model that extends the idea of separate complex number structures at each point to include structures for other types of numbers and mathematical systems that are based on numbers .",
    "the mathematics available to an observer , @xmath7 , at @xmath155 is assumed to be limited to the structures at @xmath21 in other words , mathematics is local .",
    "maps between the structures are products of parallel transforms and @xmath4 induced scaling factors .",
    "the effects of @xmath4 scaling on some aspects of physics and geometry are investigated .",
    "the fact that experiments in physics give no hint of scaling implies that scaling must be absent for all points @xmath9 in a region @xmath10 occupiable by us as observers . for all @xmath501 in @xmath401 @xmath625 outside @xmath10 at cosmological distances",
    ", this restriction does not apply .",
    "mathematical descriptions of events or properties at far away locations , @xmath1 , use the mathematics at @xmath1 .",
    "the description by @xmath577 , using the mathematics at @xmath260 requires transfer with scaling of the description at @xmath1 to @xmath336 this type of scaling is external in that the transfer is of the mathematical description .",
    "if the mathematical description at @xmath1 includes space or time integrals or derivatives , then there is a scaling factor inside the integral or derivative .",
    "this type of scaling is internal .",
    "internal scaling differs from external scaling in that external scaling can be removed by transferring the reference point to the location @xmath21 internal scaling can not be so removed .",
    "the effects of scaling on geometric properties of entities outside @xmath10 was investigated . in particular , line elements and lengths of curves were described both with and without the effects of scaling .",
    "it was seen that with separate mathematical structures at each point but without scaling , the description , using parallel transform operators , gave the same results as the usual model with just one global set of mathematical structures .",
    "the scaling factors based on @xmath4 were also found to be independent of geometry in the sense that they appear as multiplying factors that are independent of the metric tensor .",
    "the effect of the choice of reference points on scaling was described .",
    "one good feature is that the effect of scaling on physics and geometry is the same for all reference points in @xmath10 .",
    "all observers in @xmath10 should agree on the presence or absence of @xmath4 induced scaling , and the effect should be the same for all observers .",
    "two specific examples of the effect of @xmath4 on geometry are investigated . in one , @xmath4 is assumed to be time dependent and independent of space location , @xmath626 if @xmath1 is on the past light cone of any point @xmath9 in @xmath10 and @xmath627 , then distances , line elements , and other quantities increase as @xmath516 increases .",
    "@xmath549 is the time of the big bang .",
    "since @xmath535 can increase very rapidly from a very large negative value at @xmath516 equal or close to @xmath91 , scaling can describe the cramming of space into a small volume or point .",
    "it can also describe the rapid increase of space like that described by inflation @xcite .    at later times , if @xmath628 or @xmath629 , the time dependence of @xmath4 can describe the constant , or accelerated expansion of distances between points . in this sense",
    "it mimics dark energy @xcite . if @xmath630 , then the time dependence of @xmath4 describes the contraction of distances and other quantities as @xmath516 increases from @xmath91 to the present time , @xmath631 years .",
    "the other example shows that @xmath4 can give rise to what are denoted here as black and white scaling holes .",
    "black scaling holes arise in case @xmath632 is spherically symmetric around some point @xmath38 and @xmath39 as @xmath633 here @xmath37 is the radial distance between some point and @xmath16 a specific example where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is worked out .",
    "this is denoted a black scaling hole because the path length from a point @xmath9 to any point @xmath1 on the radius from @xmath9 to @xmath38 increases without bound as @xmath1 approaches @xmath16 also if a particle is placed at point @xmath9 , then one finds that the force on the particle due to @xmath4 equals the product of @xmath612 and the lagrangian density . as such",
    "it is directed towards @xmath38 and increases without bound .",
    "white scaling holes arise in case @xmath42 as @xmath633 a specific example with @xmath43 and @xmath46 is described . in this case",
    "scaled path lengths between @xmath9 and @xmath1 approach a barrier in that they approach a maximum of about @xmath634 of the unscaled path length between @xmath9 and @xmath38 as @xmath1 approaches @xmath16 the force on a particle at @xmath1 is directed outward along the radius .",
    "it also increases without bound as @xmath1 approaches @xmath16    as was noted in the discussion , there is much to be done . if , and it is a big if , one can show that physics and geometry make use of the boson field @xmath4 , either as one of the scalar fields already proposed , or to tie mathematics and physics more closely together , then real progress will have been made towards constructing a coherent theory @xcite of physics and mathematics together .",
