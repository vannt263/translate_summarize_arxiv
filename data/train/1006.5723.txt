    "interacting particle systems are a class of markov processes used to model the evolution of particles types @xmath0 on a collection of sites @xmath1 .",

    "a general interacting particle system is quite difficult to analyze and some additional properties must be considered in order to make meaningful general statements . in this paper ,",
    "our motivating examples are multi - species biological models .",
    "thus , we will be primarily focused on circumstances in which the number of particles types @xmath11 is at least three  vacant and two species of organism .",
    "the contact process @xcite is a basic interacting particle system used to build many biological models , and the nature of the interactions which occur has led us to introduce the ` interaction map ' which characterizes the allowable interactions in a model .",
    "the main result is a characterization of those interaction maps that lead to monotone processes . in this case",
    ", the particle types @xmath0 must be ordered thus endowing the state space with a partial ordering ` @xmath12 ' ( sitewise comparison ) .",
    "monotonicity allows us to reduce the analysis of many properties of an interacting particle system to a study of the process considering the evolution starting from the small number on initial configurations that are extremal under the given partial order .",
    "for example , the coupling from the past ( cftp ) algorithm @xcite allows us to obtain an exact sample from the stationary distribution of an irreducible and aperiodic markov chain with a finite state space . for monotone processes ,",
    "the algorithm need only be applied to the extremal states @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( the states where all sites are identically occupied by @xmath15 or @xmath16 particles respectively ) such that @xmath17 for all @xmath18 .",
    "the interaction map formulation also allows for a fast assessment of whether or not reordering the particles may make the process attractive .",
    "we show that switching the order of the basic two type contact process results in attractiveness .",
    "we will briefly review the contact process and monotonicity .",
    "this will set the stage for the development of the interaction map .",
    "the contact process is a _ spin system _ ( it only has two particle types ) , and it is the basic interacting particle system of interest here .",

    "a birth occurs at a rate proportional to the number of infected neighbors .",
    "an occupied site becomes vacant at rate one .",
    "the transition rate for a spin system is referred to as the _ flip rate _ , and denoted @xmath22 .",
    "thus for the contact process , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the indicator function for particle type 1 .",
    "numerous variations have been created around the rule that infection occurs at a rate proportional to the number of occupied neighboring sites .",

    "it is a single species model which includes two life stages .",
    "the transitions are such that 2 s give birth to 1 s and the 1 s mature into 2 s at a constant rate : @xmath27 the grass  bushes  trees successional model proposed by durrett and swindle @xcite is a two - type contact process as well .",
    "it is the basic two - type contact process with the modification that 2 s are allow to give birth onto sites occupied by 1 s in addition to empty sites : @xmath28    these models are all multitype contact processes , however they are no longer spin systems so what is generally required for attractiveness has not been previously known . in @xcite ( theorem 3.1 ) , it is shown that the two - stage contact process is monotone with respect to its parameters . in @xcite ( proposition 1.1 ) , a more complicated type of monotonicity property is described for a three - type contact process .",
    "a markov process with a partially ordered state space , @xmath29 , and semigroup , @xmath30 , is called _ monotone _ if either of the equivalent conditions , ( [ eq : monsemi ] ) or ( [ eq : moncoup ] ) , is shown to be satisfied .",
