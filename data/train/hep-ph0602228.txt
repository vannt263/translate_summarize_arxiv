    "since years , the pomeron remains a subject of many interrogations .",
    "indeed , defined as the virtual colourless carrier of strong interactions , the nature of the pomeron is still a real challenge .",
    "while in the perturbative regime of qcd it can be defined as a compound system of two perturbatively reggeized gluons@xcite in the approximation of resumming the leading logs in energy , its non - perturbative structure is basically unknown .",
    "however , in the recent years , an interesting experimental investigation on `` hard '' diffractive processes led to a new insight into pomeron problems .",
    "it is now experimentally well established at hera @xcite that a substantial fraction of @xmath3 events is contributable to diffraction , i.e. color singlet exchange , initiated by a highly virtual photon .",
    "starting with the pioneering theoretical work of ref.@xcite , the idea of a point - like structure of the pomeron exchange opens the way to the determination of its parton ( quark and gluon ) distributions , where the pomeron point - like structure can be treated in a similar way as ( and compared to ) the proton one .",
    "indeed , leading twist contributions to the proton diffractive structure functions can be defined by factorization properties @xcite in much the same way as for the full proton structure functions themselves . as such",
    ", they should obey dglap evolution equations @xcite , and thus allow for perturbative predictions of their @xmath2 evolution .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", we have shown that the data are well described by a qcd analysisin which point - like parton distributions , evolving according to the dglap equations , are assigned to the leading and sub - leading regge exchanges .",
    "the gluon distributions were found to be quite different for h1 and zeus .",
    "then , in ref.@xcite , we have derived sets of quark and gluon parton distributions for the pomeron , and predictions for the charm and the longitudinal diffractive structure function from the qcd fit .",
    "an extrapolation to the tevatron range was also compared with cdf data on single diffraction . in ref.@xcite",
    ", we have asked the question whether the quark and gluon distributions in the pomeron obtained from qcd fits to hard diffraction processes at hera could be dynamically generated by qcd evolution from a state made of _ valence - like _ gluons and sea quarks as an input . by a method combining _ backward _",
    "@xmath2-evolution for data exploration and _ forward _",
    "@xmath2-evolution for a best fit determination , we have found that the diffractive structure functions published by the h1 collaboration at hera could be described by a simple _ valence - like _ input at an initial low scale .",
    "the same property was not achieved when using zeus data .",
    "these previous analyses were based on diffractive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) cross - sections determined at hera @xcite .",
    "it can be seen as a first stage in studying aspects of the qcd fit technique applied to diffraction , as for example the flexibility of the parton distributions parameterisations .    in the present paper",
    ", we produce new sets of diffractive parton distribution functions ( dpdfs ) extracted from the presently published data sets , which consist in the already mentionned set for h1 @xcite and the latest results from zeus diffractive dis cross - sections @xcite .",
    "the results on dpdfs are close to those of ref.@xcite .",
    "we give for the first time a new method to evaluate the uncertainty on the gluon density at large values of @xmath1 , which is a key point for any further discussion of the influence of dpdfs at tevatron or lhc .",
    "then , we present the main result of this article , which is to show how these diffractive parton densities enter in the simulations of the dijet mass fraction at the tevatron in central diffractive dijet production within the double pomeron formulation . we show that this quantity is much sensitive to the high @xmath1 tail of the gluon in the pomeron .",
    "our analysis allows to provide the extrapolation of the fits to very high @xmath2 since they will be relevant for qcd and hard diffraction studies at the lhc .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the diffractive structure function @xmath0 , measured from dis events with large rapidity gaps , can be investigated in the framework of regge factorization and expressed as a sum of two factorized contributions corresponding to a pomeron and secondary reggeon trajectories :    @xmath4    in this parameterisation , @xmath5 can be interpreted as the pomeron structure function and @xmath6 as an effective reggeon structure function , with the restriction that it takes together into account various secondary regge contributions which can hardly be separated .",
    "the pomeron , @xmath7 , and reggeon , @xmath8 , fluxes are assumed to follow a regge behaviour with linear trajectories @xmath9 , such that    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the minimal kinematically - allowed value of @xmath12 and @xmath13 gev@xmath14 is the limit of the measurement .",
    "the values of the @xmath15-slope parameters are taken from hadron - hadron data ( @xmath16 gev@xmath17 , @xmath18 gev@xmath17 , @xmath19 gev@xmath17 , @xmath20 gev@xmath17 ) , since the data are not precise enough to determine them @xcite .",
    "we assign parton distribution functions to the pomeron and to the reggeon , considered as coumpound states of fundamental quarks and gluons .",
    "a simple and well - known prescription of qcd factorisation is that the parton distributions of both the pomeron and the reggeon are parameterized in terms of non - perturbative input distributions at some low scale which was adopted here to be @xmath21 gev@xmath14 .",
    "the pion structure function @xcite is assumed to be also valid for the sub - leading reggeon trajectory with a free global normalization to be determined by the data .    for the pomeron , a quark flavour singlet distribution , @xmath22 , and a gluon distribution , @xmath23 ,",
    "are parameterized in termsof coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath25 at @xmath26 gev@xmath14 as it was done in ref.@xcite such that    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the fractional momentum of the pomeron carried by the struck parton , @xmath29 is the @xmath30 member in a set of chebyshev polynomials , chosen such that @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in the following , we present the results in terms of the overall quark density with the hypothesis that @xmath34 , which means that each light quark density is equal to @xmath35 .",
    "a sum of @xmath36 orthonormal polynomials is used so that the input distributions are free to adopt a large range of forms for a given number of parameters .",
    "any bias towards a particular solution due to the choice of the functional form of the input distribution is therefore minimized .    in ref.@xcite , we have used the following fixed pomeron intercepts for h1 and zeus data sets , @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively , as well as @xmath39 for the reggeon intercept in case of h1 ( there is no need for reggeons for zeus data ) . in the following ,",
    "we introduce the pomeron intercept as a free parameter in the qcd fit .",
    "only data points with virtuality @xmath40 gev@xmath14 , diffractive mass at the photon vertex @xmath41 gev and rapidity @xmath42 are included in the fit in order to avoid large higher - twist effects and the region that may be most strongly affected by a non - zero value of the longitudinal over transverse ratio @xmath43 .",
    "the fits include 179 data points for h1 data @xcite with 8 parameters ( 3 for the sea quark density , 3 for the gluon density and 1 for the normalization of the reggeon contribution and 1 for the pomeron intercept ) .",
    "thus , we have 171 degrees of freedom with a @xmath44 of @xmath45 using statistical errors only . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "only 161 data points were included in the qcd fit procedure since an additional cut for @xmath46 was considered in the analysis . in the new version of the fits , we gain in sensitivity with a larger number of data points , in particular on the gluon density .",
    "for example , the third parameter for the gluon density @xmath47 was not constrained in ref.@xcite with a value of @xmath48 and it is found to be zero in the new analysis .",
    "then , for h1 data , 3 parameters for quarks and 2 parameters for the gluon densties are enough to give a proper description of the cross section measurements through the qcd fit procedure .",
    "also , new results and parameters obtained in ref.@xcite are in perfect agreement for the quarks within the quoted statistical uncertainties .    for zeus data @xcite , the fits include 102 data points with 7 parameters ( the parameter corresponding to the normalization of the reggeon contribution is absent ) .",
    "we have 95 degrees of freedom with a @xmath44 of @xmath49 using statistical errors only .",
    "note that zeus measurements are realised for diffractive mass at the proton vertex @xmath50  gev and squared transfer - momentum @xmath51  gev@xmath14 , whereas h1 gives diffractive cross sections for @xmath52  gev and @xmath53  gev@xmath14 .",
    "we have converted zeus data points to the same @xmath54 range by multiplying zeus values by the factor @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "this factor takes into account the conversion from @xmath50  gev to @xmath52  gev for the zeus measurements , which reflects mainly the fact that the proton - dissociation is reduced for the range of h1 data set . the uncertainty on this number is of course large ( of",
    "about @xmath56 @xcite ) , but we do not take it into account in the following as we do not propose a common fit of h1 and zeus data sets , which would require a relative normalisation error .    on fig.[f4 ] , structure function measurements from both data sets are shown . in this last figure ,",
    "zeus data points have been multiplied by the factor 0.77 as explained above , and extrapolated to h1 bin centers .",
    "this extrapolation is done just for the plot , zeus data points have been included in the qcd fits at their exact kinematic values .    to get solvable evolution equations ,",
    "the parton distribution functions must approach zero as @xmath57 .",
    "this is achieved by introducing in eqs . the exponential term with a positive value of the parameter @xmath58 .",
    "unless otherwise indicated , in the following fits @xmath58 is set to @xmath59 such that this term only influences the parametrisation in the region @xmath60 .",
    "this term is only present to ensure the convergence and plays a rle in a domain where we do not include data ( for instance , at @xmath610.65 , its value is equal to 0.97 ) .",
    "the functions @xmath62 and @xmath63 are evolved to higher @xmath2 using the next - to - leading order dglap evolution equations ( with the code of ref.@xcite ) , with @xmath64 ( in ref.@xcite , a lower value of @xmath65 has been considered ) . the contribution to @xmath66 from charm quarks",
    "is calculated in the fixed flavour scheme using the photon - gluon fusion prescription given in ref.@xcite as implemented in ref.@xcite .",
    "the contribution from heavier quarks is neglected .",
    "no momentum sum rule has been imposed because of the theoretical uncertainty in specifying the normalization of the pomeron or reggeon fluxes.it is also not clear that such a sum rule is appropriate for the parton distributions of a virtually exchanged state . after fitting , however , we observed that the sum rules were fulfilled within 10% despite being not required in the fits .",
    "already from fig.[f4 ] we can get a good idea of the relative gluon densities between h1 and zeus data sets .",
    "indeed , we notice a good agreement at @xmath67  gev@xmath14 ( and @xmath46 ) whereas both sets of measurements show discrepancies at larger @xmath68  gev@xmath14 .",
    "zeus cross section values are below h1 for this @xmath2 value , which means that scaling violations in case of zeus are lower .",
    "thus , from this basic observation , we expect a lower gluon density in case of zeus data compared to h1 .",
    "the resulting parton densities of the pomeron extrapolated from the qcd fit procedure are presented in fig.[f12b ] ( extrapolated till @xmath69  gev@xmath14 ) and the parameter values are given in table i.    a few comments are in order :    * we notice that the quark contribution is smaller compared to the gluon one , and much smaller for h1 prediction , confirming the standard results exposed for example in ref.@xcite . on fig.[f12b ] , the uncertainties of the parton distributions are not shown but they can be derived from table i , giving typically a 25% error for the gluon density . * in the range of the measurements , essentially below @xmath70  gev@xmath14 for h1@xcite and below @xmath71  gev@xmath14 for zeus@xcite , the agreement between h1 and zeus for quark densities is reasonnable .",
    "+ * gluon densities for both data sets is quite different , especially at large @xmath1 .",
    "this last point has been addressed above from the simple observation of scaling violations and is more extensively discussed below .",
    "the result of the fit is presented in fig.[f4 ] together with the experimental values .",
    "the fit is plotted only in the @xmath72 bins considered for the qcd analysis . in this last figure , as mentioned above , zeus data points have been converted to the same @xmath52  gev domain as h1 ( multiplying zeus measurements by a multiplicative factor 0.77 as explained above ) and extrapolated to h1 bin centers .",
    "however , the qcd - fit procedure and extraction of parton distributions have been done exactly on zeus published data points @xcite . the extrapolation to h1 bin centers is applied only for the presentation of fig.[f4 ] and we have checked that these conversion factors are small ( of the order a few per cent ) .",
    "we see on this figure the good agreement of the qcd fit with the data points , which supports the validity of the description of the pomeron in terms of partons following perturbative qcd dynamics , even if the accuracy of the gluon determination is still quite poor .",
    "this provides a very nice perspective for diffractive analyses of more recent data to be released , where better accuracy will lead to a more precise qcd analysis .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     .5 cm    table i- pomeron quark and gluon densities parameters .",
    "note that @xmath47 is found to be negligeable for h1 data . also , as mentionned above , there is no reggeon contribution for zeus data . for h1 data ,",
    "the parameters are close to those of ref.@xcite within the quoted statistical uncertainties , even if we expect some differences as it is explained in the text : for example , more data points are considered and some small changes are done in the qcd fit procedure .      in order to analyze in more detail the large @xmath73 behaviour of the gluon distribution @xmath74 and give a rough estimate of the systematic error related to our parametrizations , we consider the possibility to change the ansatz by a multiplicative factor @xmath75 we shall consider @xmath76 to vary in the interval @xmath77 in order to allow for the still large indetermination of the gluon distribution . if we include this multiplicative factor @xmath78 in the qcd fit analysis with statistical errors , we derive a value of @xmath79 .",
    "then , the variation in the interval @xmath77 considered here takes also into account a systematic effect of the order of the statistical uncertainty , which is correct . as it is explained more extensively below",
    ", the understanding of the large @xmath73 behaviour is of essential interest for any predictions at the tevatron or lhc in central dijets production . in particular ,",
    "a proper determination of the uncertainty in this domain of momentum is necessary and the method we propose in this article is a first estimate , that can be propagated to other measurements .    following ref.@xcite , one knows that starting with a given large @xmath73 input function of the form @xmath80 the effect of leading order dglap evolution is to change the end - point exponent by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the number of active flavors , up to a normalization factor .",
    "hence , let us consider a given solution of the dglap evolution equation , such as our structure function @xmath83 and its large @xmath73 tail at @xmath84 parametrized by @xmath85 then , changing the high @xmath73 behaviour of the input function by @xmath86 will change the exponent @xmath87 by the same shift , namely @xmath88 note that the same property is valid for the singlet quark distribution @xcite .    to be fully consistent with the nlo analysis",
    ", we estimated the effect of next - leading dglap evolution on the modifications of the high @xmath73 behaviour due to next - leading effects @xcite .",
    "we found that the next - leading corrections to the overall high @xmath73 exponent @xmath89 is of the order of its inverse @xmath90  % when @xmath87 varies in the kinematical interval in consideration .",
    "this correction is negligeable in the conditions of our fits .",
    "the qcd fits we obtained from hera data allow us to make direct comparisons for measurements at the tevatron .",
    "it is quite interesting to be able to test directly the factorization breaking between hera and the tevatron using the measurements performed at both accelerators .",
    "we thus compare the extrapolations of the h1 and zeus qcd fits to the recent cdf single diffractive jet cross - section measurement @xcite .",
    "the result is given in fig.[cdf ] .",
    "we note a large discrepancy both in shape and normalization between h1 predictions and cdf data , clearly showing factorization breaking",
    ". however , the zeus fits are more compatible in normalization with the cdf measurement even if the shape is not described properly . we know that the gluon density from zeus is between 2 and 3 times smaller than the one from h1 .",
    "the predictions for single diffractive production of jets at the tevatron are thus expected to be different by an sizeable factor 2 to 3 between h1 and zeus since they correspond to single pomeron exchange . if the large statistical and systematicuncertainties on the gluon density are taken into account ( about 50%for zeus , 25% for h1 ) ,",
    "zeus data are compatible with factorization at low @xmath1 .",
    "one should , however , question whether one has the right to extrapolate zeus results without introducing the additional reggeon component .",
    "namely the cdf measurement is in a region in @xmath91 where the reggeon contribution is important , in contrary to the zeus measurement .",
    "the error bar on the extrapolation from the fit for zeus is thus enhanced due to this uncertainty . concerning the extrapolation of the h1 fit and the comparison with cdf data ,",
    "one notices that the cdf data lie primilarly at low values of @xmath1 where there are few h1 data points .",
    "moreover , in this kinematical domain , the h1 data have the tendency to lie more in the high @xmath91 region where the reggeon contribution is important and not well constrained by the fit .",
    "thus , the extrapolation to the cdf domain suffers from large uncertainties .",
    "a combined fit using cdf data to constrain the low @xmath1 region and the hera data to constrain the high @xmath1 domain would thus be of great interest .",
    "more precise data from hera and detailed comparisons with the tevatron are thus needed to study precisely factorization breaking between both experiments .",
    "the discussion of eventual higher twist contributions is clearly also valuable in order to reach conclusions on the shape at larger @xmath92 it is thus important to get an accurate measurement of the gluon density in the pomeron at low values of @xmath1 from hera .",
    "furthermore the forward proton detector @xcite installed by the d0 collaboration for run ii will be of great help to get a direct measurement of the diffractive structure functions .",
    "the cdf and d  experiments at the tevatron can measure directly the dijet mass fraction , defined as the ratio of the dijet mass to the total diffractive mass measured either in roman pot detectors or in the main d  or cdf detectors .",
    "let us first notice that we normalised the diffractive dijet cross section using directly the cdf run i measurement previously which takes into account the factorisation breaking between the tevatron and hera @xcite .",
    "it has already been mentionned that this measurement is quite sensitive to the pomeron structure in quark and gluons @xcite .",
    "we display in fig.[fcdfc ] the dijet mass fraction for the two different gluon distributions described previously from h1 and zeus data after requiring two jets in the central detector with a transverse momentum greater than 25 gev .",
    "we indeed see that the difference between the gluon distributions from h1 and zeus at hera can be probed using tevatron data , provided the survival gap probability ( correction which is due to soft interactions ) is constant over the full kinematical range . to better show the possibility of such a measurement , we give in fig.[fcdfb ] the dijet mass fraction when the @xmath93 is tagged in the dipole roman pot detector from the d  collaboration .",
    "the dipole detectors show a good acceptance for @xmath15 close to @xmath94 it would also be possible to require double tagged events ( the antiproton in the dipole roman pot detector and the proton in the quadrupole one ) , but the acceptance of the quadrupole detectors only extends to @xmath95 gev@xmath14 which cuts a lot of events .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is also possible to probe the high-@xmath1 gluon density in the pomeron at the tevatron again through the measurement of the dijet mass fraction ( or the total diffractive mass ) . in fig[fcdfd ] , we givethe dijet mass fraction using the shape of gluon distribution in the pomeron coming from h1 .",
    "the sensitivity to the uncertainty on the gluon distribution at high @xmath1 is indicated on that figure by multiplying the gluon distribution by @xmath96 , which enhances or decreases the high @xmath1 gluon distribution .",
    "it is quite important to be able to constrain this distribution since it is a direct background to an eventual exclusive signal at high @xmath1 .",
    "we notice that it is indeed possible to constrain the high-@xmath1 gluon using tevatron data . at the lhc",
    ", it will be possible to constrain better the high-@xmath1 gluon density using higher mass objects , for instance in @xmath97 inclusive diffractive production .",
    "we have shown that the proton diffractive structure function @xmath0 measured in the h1 and zeus experiments at hera can be well described by a perturbative qcd analysisin which fundamental quark and gluon distributions , evolving according to the next - leading dglap equations , are assigned to the leading and sub - leading regge exchanges .",
    "the gluon distributions have been found to be quite different when extracted from present published data for h1 and zeus .",
    "an extrapolation to the tevatron range have been compared with cdf data on single diffraction , leading at this stage to quite different conclusions on factorization breaking between hera and tevatron depending on whether h1 ( strong violation ) or zeus ( compatibility at low @xmath1 ) fits are used .",
    "the discrepancies of the gluon densities between both data sets have also been explained when looking simply at the scaling violations , the qcd fit procedure giving a quantitative estimate of these differences .",
    "we have presented a new method to evaluate the uncertainty on the gluon density at large values of @xmath1 , which is a key point for any further discussion of the influence of dpdfs at tevatron or lhc .    in double diffractive dijet production in the central rapidity region , within the double pomeron formulation , we have found that the tevatron mass fraction is very sensitive to the high @xmath1 tail of the gluon in the pomeron .",
    "extrapolation of the fits to very high @xmath2 have been given since they will be relevant for qcd studies at the lhc .",
    "hence , we have shown that it is possible to constrain the high-@xmath1 gluon using tevatron data , which may be of decisive interest for any future measurement in central diffractive dijet topologies .    at the lhc",
    ", it will be possible to constrain better the high-@xmath1 gluon density using higher mass objects , for instance in @xmath97 inclusive diffractive production .",
    "we hope that our parametrisations , and the ones easily obtainable exactly with the same technique with forthcoming hera data , will be useful for the qcd analysis of present and future experiments at the tevatron and the lhc .",
