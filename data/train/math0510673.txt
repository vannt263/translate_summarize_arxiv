    "in @xcite , pesin studied a general class of piecewise diffeomorphisms with a hyperbolic attractor .",
    "he showed the existence of the sinai - bowen - ruelle measure , or @xmath0-measure for short , and studied the ergodic properties of this measure .",
    "if @xmath1 is the system in question then the @xmath0-measure is a weak limit point of the sequence of measures @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the lebesgue measure .",
    "pesin showed that the @xmath0-measure has at most countably many ergodic components .",
    "this measure is the physically relevant measure as it captures the behaviour of the orbits of points from a set of positive lebesgue measure .    for a more restricted class ,",
    "sataev @xcite showed that there are only finitely many ergodic components .",
    "schmeling and troubetzkoy studied in @xcite a more general class than pesin s and proved the existence of the @xmath0-measure .",
    "their method to deal with the non - invertibility of the system was to lift the system to a higher dimension and get an invertible system on which the calculations were made . in this way methods from invertible systems could be used .",
    "the result could then be projected back to the original system .    in @xcite ,",
    "alexander and yorke considered a one parameter class of maps called the fat baker s transformations .",
    "these maps are piecewise affine maps of the square with one expanding and one contracting direction .",
    "their results together with the result of solomyak in @xcite , imply that for a positive measure set of parameters , there is an absolutely continuous invariant measure .",
    "the belykh map , was first introduced in @xcite by belykh . schmeling and considered in @xcite the belykh map for a wider range of parameters .",
    "the fat baker s transformations are a special case of the belykh map in this wider range of parameters .",
    "the belykh map was further investigated in @xcite .    in this article",
    "we consider a class of piecewise affine hyperbolic maps on a set @xmath4 , with one contracting and one expanding direction .",
    "this class is contained in the class of maps studied in @xcite and it contains the belykh maps as well as the fat baker s transformations .",
    "it is shown that if a functions from this class is sufficiently area - expanding then almost surely ( in the sense of corollary [ cor : acim ] ) there is an absolutely continuous invariant measure .",
    "the method used to show this is a development of the method from @xcite . here",
    "a new problem arises : the symbolic space changes as the parameters changes . in this paper a way to handle this problem is introduced .",
    "the different symbolic spaces are embedded in a larger space and certain estimates are carried out that makes this larger space possible to handle .    in @xcite and @xcite , tsujii considered two classes of maps in two dimension and showed that almost all of these maps have absolutely continuous invariant measure .",
    "these two classes are different from the class of maps considered in this paper .",
    "tsujii also used the method from @xcite , but in a different way than is used in this paper .",
