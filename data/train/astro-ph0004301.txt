    "the relationship between the large - scale morphology of seyfert ( sy ) host galaxies and the central nonstellar activity is a long - standing problem and the focus of an ongoing debate .",
    "shlosman , frank & begelman ( 1989 ) argued that stellar - dynamical processes on scales of a few kpcs , and gas - dynamical processes on smaller scales , combine to drive the gas towards the centers and fuel the active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "sufficient evidence , observational and theoretical , supports the idea that nonaxisymmetries in the background gravitational potential , e.g. , stellar bars , induce radial mass redistribution in disk galaxies ( e.g. , simkin , su & schwarz 1980 ; balick & heckman 1982 ; shlosman , begelman & frank 1990 ; athanassoula 1994 ; buta & combes 1996 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a number of optical surveys claimed no correlation between the large - scale morphology and the central activity ( e.g. , moles , mrquez & prez 1995 ; ho , filippenko & sargent 1997 ; mulchaey & regan 1997 ) . the perennial question , therefore , to be addressed is _ whether the agn host galaxies differ morphologically from ` normal ' ( non - active ) galaxies , and on what spatial scales_.    high - resolution near - infrared ( nir ) observations are clearly advantageous in determining the mass distribution and hence detecting large - scale bars ( mcleod & rieke 1995 ; mulchaey & regan 1997 ; peletier et al .",
    "1999 , hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "knapen , shlosman & peletier ( 2000 , paper  ii ) used sub - arcsec resolution imaging in three nir bands ( @xmath3 ) to study the complete cfa sample of sy s and a _ matched _ control sample of normal galaxies using objective and stringent criteria for assigning bars .",
    "here we look at a different aspect , and , instead of studying the frequency of bars in galaxies , investigate the bar axial ratios ( i.e. , bar ellipticities ) .",
    "this is done for _ all _ matching samples which are large enough and available in the literature .",
    "bar parameters , such as strength , mass , and pattern speed , are very difficult to estimate from observations of stellar morphology alone . even for the simplest models ,",
    "bar strength depends on bar s quadrupole moment and on the radial distribution of axisymmetric mass in the disk , bulge and halo .",
    "the optical rc3 catalogue ( de vaucouleurs et al . 1991 ) recognizes three broad morphological classes , a , x , and b , i.e. , nonbarred , intermediate barred and strongly barred .",
    "this rc3 classification , however , is subjective and has , to our knowledge , not been properly documented .",
    "we state that presently , it is not feasible to estimate the distribution of bar strengths proper in any statistically significant sample , but bar axial ratios can provide a reasonable alternative ( martin 1995 ) . here",
    "we develop this idea .    in this letter",
    "we report a systematic difference in the distribution of the deprojected ellipticities of large - scale stellar bars between four samples of sy and normal ` control ' galaxies , of which three are independent .",
    "we describe the samples used , provide results of our analysis , and discuss their implications for understanding the agn - host galaxy connection .",
    "we use three independent samples of sy s .",
    "nir surface photometry is available for two of them , allowing us to apply our criteria for bar classification . using a stringent criterion , we classified a galaxy barred , ( paper  ii ) if _ ( i ) _ there is a significant rise in isophote ellipticity followed by a significant fall , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are semi - major and -minor isophote axes ; _",
    "( ii ) _ the position angle of isophote major axis is constant within the bar range . the bar ellipticity was defined as @xmath8 ( e.g. , martin 1995 ) . a galaxy is also classified as barred if the major axis position angle shows a change of more than 75@xmath9 , accompanied by an ellipticity above 0.1 . denoting large ellipticity ( small axial ratio @xmath10 ) bars with _ strong _",
    "( i.e. , ` thin ' bars ) and small ellipticity ( large axial ratio ) bars with _ weak _ (",
    "i.e. , ` fat ' bars ) , we divided the deprojected range of bar ellipticities @xmath11 into two groups , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "our results do not depend critically on the boundary between these two groups ( see below ) .",
    "ellipticities @xmath14 were ignored and the galaxy was considered unbarred . for the samples based on the rc3 classification , ` s ' and ` w ' bar types were taken as the projected ` b ' and ` x ' types , respectively , but due to the uncertainty in relating the rc3 morphology to even the bar ellipticities , we do _ not _ base our conclusions on it .",
    "the following samples of sy and matched normal ( control ) galaxies were used :    1 .   * ksp - rc3 sample . *",
    "paper  ii  cfa sample of sy s ( huchra & burg 1992 ) observed in nir .",
    "morphological classification from rc3 .",
    "galaxies were excluded when too small ( @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the isophotal radius in arcsec at @xmath17 = 19 mag  arcsec@xmath18 ) , interacting ( severely distorted or companion within 1 ) , or highly inclined ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "a synthetic control sample of normal galaxies chosen from the rc3 was closely matched to cfa sy s in morphological type ( including barred / un - barred ) , ellipticity and absolute magnitude ( see paper  ii for details about the technique used here ) .",

    "since we are only concerned here with the relative distribution of s vs. w - type bars in active and normal galaxies , we compare the frequency of s bars for sy s , @xmath20 , namely , @xmath21\\over { [ s+w]}}\\ ] ] with those in normal galaxies , @xmath22 . if the bar morphology in sy s and normal galaxies is identical , both frequencies should be the same",
    ". however , fig .  1 ( see also table  1 ) shows that in each individual sample studied there is a systematic deficiency of s - type bars in active galaxies , associated , however , with a relatively large uncertainty .",

    "bx in the last column indicates that the classification of the rc3 was used , while @xmath11 means that our own ellipticity - criterion was used.[table1 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     third , we tested the sensitivity of our results to the assumed boundary between s and w - type bars .",
    "this was achieved by moving this boundary between 0.35 and 0.55 ( table 2 ) . moving it even more",
    "would not leave enough galaxies in either the weak or the strong bins .",
    "the fraction of s or w bars does not depend critically on the exact position of the boundary .",
    "for each sample individually the error is rather large , but for all the samples the frequency of s bars in seyferts lies below that of the control sample . to show the significance of this result ,",
    "we have constructed a larger sample by taking together all seyferts of mrk and ksp , and comparing them with a control sample consisting of both control samples combined ( the last two columns of table  2 and fig .  2 ) .",
    "to6.in    ' '' ''    fourth",
    ", we have performed kolmogorov - smyrnov tests to check whether seyfert and control samples can be seen as drawn from the same intrinsic distribution . for the deprojected ksp sample the probability that this is in fact the case is 53% . for the deprojected mrk sample we find 11% , while for the projected samples the probability is 72% and 54% , respectively .",
    "these numbers show that this test is inconclusive",
    ". it does not show that it is likely that the fractions of s and w - type bars are different in seyferts from those in non - seyferts , although it can not exclude this possibility .",
    "in any case , independent of the exact method by which the bar type , s or w , was determined ( i.e. , based on rc3 classification , projected or deprojected bar ellipticities ) , the frequency of s bars in seyferts is systematically lower than in normal galaxies .",
    "we conclude that the result that sy s have more w - type ( ` fat ' ) bars than s - type ( ` thin ' ) bars in normal galaxies is robust , and that it is found for a variety of samples with bars measured in a number of ways .",
    "all samples used in the previous section provide a coherent picture of bar ellipticity distribution in barred sy hosts and matching control samples of normal barred galaxies .",
    "the most intriguing and important result is the apparent deficiency of stellar bars with large ellipticities ( i.e. , large @xmath11 ) in sy s , compared to those found in their non - active counterparts .",
    "although this effect is at the level of @xmath25 , due to small number statistics , it is consistent across all the sy and matching control samples .",
    "there are two possible explanations for the observed phenomena within the framework of galaxy evolution both of which are dependent on the cold gas component in the disk .",
    "first , numerical simulations of pure stellar disks have shown that the bar instability becomes milder , i.e. , produces a bar with smaller ellipticities , if the disk is hotter initially , prior to instability ( athanassoula 1983 ) .",
    "this can be understood as weaker swing amplification in disks with larger velocity dispersion ( toomre 1981 ) .",
    "an additional caveat is that the presence of a cold and clumpy gas component in the disk provides a heating source for stars and acts to weaken _ all _ dynamical instabilities , including the bar instability ( shlosman & noguchi 1993 ) and the vertical bending of the bar ( berentzen et al .",
    "gas gravity is crucial here and even reasonable amounts of cold gas are sufficient to suppress the instabilities altogether . if indeed sy disks have a larger fraction of cold gas than normal galaxies ( e.g. , hunt et al .",
    "1999 ) , which may also be more clumpy , this trend should be explored more fully .",
    "the resulting difference(s ) between sy and normal disks will be long - lasting because the stellar component , once heated up , will not be able to cool down easily , as the stellar ` fluid ' is non - dissipative .",
    "our understanding of the evolution of barred galaxies points to an alternative and possibly more elegant explanation for the observed difference in bar properties between active and normal galaxies .",
    "numerical simulations of bars revealed their weakening with time in response to a growing mass concentration in the galactic centers ( hasan & norman 1990 ; friedli & benz 1993 ; hasan , pfenniger & norman 1993 ; berentzen et al .",
    "the radial gas inflow towards the central kpc and further inwards is the prime suspect .",
    "all or part of this gas can contribute to the growth of galactic bulges , nuclear rings , disks and bars , and ultimately to central black holes ( bhs ) by dissolution of the main family of periodic orbits supporting the large - scale stellar bars .",
    "these so - called @xmath26 orbits ( e.g. , sellwood & wilkinson 1993 ) are replaced by stochastic orbits when the mass of the central bh exceeds @xmath27 of the total mass .",
    "heller & shlosman ( 1996 ) also found that nuclear rings with masses greater than a few @xmath28 lead to @xmath26 orbit dissolution exterior to the ring , leaving smaller bar remnants escaping detection inside the central kpc .    in view of the fact that the supermassive bhs appear to be ubiquitous in normal galaxies ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) and not only in sy nuclei",
    ", it seems relevant to ask why the sy hosts are affected more by the bar dissolution processes than normal galaxies .",
    "a resolution of this paradox can lie in that the bhs in sy s are more massive than in their non - active counterparts , but only statistically .",
    "if indeed supermassive bhs play a role in the bar dissolution , we anticipate that their instantaneous mass distributions in sy s and normal hosts peak at different values , but have a large overlap . moreover , it is plausible that ground - based observations based on stellar - dynamical considerations overestimate the bh masses in normal galaxies due to insufficient spatial resolution",
    ". these mass estimates may be lowered by upcoming hst observations .    in summary",
    ", we have analyzed all available reasonably - sized samples of sy host galaxies and independent control samples of normal galaxies carefully matched in type , disk ellipticity , absolute magnitude , and , to some extent , in redshift .",
    "we find that samples of active galaxies are systematically deficient in high - ellipticity ` thin ' stellar bars compared to normal galaxies .",
    "the associated uncertainty is quite large and the overall effect is at the @xmath0 level .",
    "we discuss the corollaries of this effect .",
    "the acceptable alternatives point towards the cold and clumpy gas component in the disk as being responsible for the observed effect .",
    "our result provides an indication that sy host galaxies differ systematically on scales of a few kpc from their normal counterparts , and that the gas component may be responsible for this .",
