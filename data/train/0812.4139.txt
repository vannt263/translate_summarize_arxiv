    "in general , it is difficult to find the exact solution of an interacting many - body system , except for a few simple cases .",
    "hence , various mean - field theories  @xcite have been proposed and widely used to get some insight into the properties and behavior of the systems .",
    "a mean - field concept was first used by weiss  @xcite for the problem of ferromagnetism .",
    "weiss s molecular - field theory ( mft ) was successful in providing a qualitative understanding of the transition from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic states .",
    "after the initial success by weiss,@xcite the mft has played an important role in the studies of many - body systems and is still often used as a starting point of the investigation due to its simplicity .    in the vicinity of the critical point ,",
    "mean - field - type theories generally breaks down since statistical fluctuations neglected in them become important .",
    "therefore , in order to study the detailed critical properties ( e.g. , critical exponents ) , it is necessary to resort to other techniques , such as the renormalization - group methods.@xcite however , since mean - field - type methods are capable of predicting the behavior of the system over a wide range of parameters ( e.g. , temperature ) at a relatively low cost , a further development of those methods is still important , and many attempts have been made even in recent years.@xcite    the ising model is the simplest nontrivial model of cooperative phenomena .",
    "the hamiltonian for this model is given by @xmath1 where the sum runs over all nearest - neighbor pairs , @xmath2 is the coupling strength , and the spin @xmath3 takes either @xmath4 or @xmath5 . in the mft ,",
    "the interactions between a spin and its surrounding spins are treated approximately , and the many - body problem is reduced to an effective one - body problem of a single spin in the effective magnetic field @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of nearest neighbors and @xmath8 is the magnetization of the system . solving the self - consistent equation for the magnetization @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is an average over the ensemble , one can obtain the well - known result for the critical temperature of the transition from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic states : @xmath11 mean - field - type methods generally give only classical predictions for the critical exponents , but the value of the calculated critical temperature is a reasonable measure for assessing the accuracy of the method .    to obtain more accurate results than this `` one - site cluster '' approximation",
    ", it is quite natural that one attempts to increase the size of clusters .",
    "@xcite for example , in the so - called bethe - peierls - weiss ( bpw ) approximation,@xcite using a cluster of @xmath12 sites ( one central spin and its surrounding @xmath7 spins ) , one can partially take into account the effects of spin correlations and fluctuations .",
    "the interactions of the central spin with its nearest neighbors ( called the `` first shell '' ) are treated exactly , while the influence of spins outside the cluster is replaced by an effective field @xmath13 which acts on the @xmath7 spins of the first shell .",
    "unlike the mft , the effective field @xmath13 is determined by the condition that the average value of the central spin should be equal to that of the spin on a first - shell site .",
    "recently , du @xmath14 @xmath15.@xcite extended the bpw method by using a group of chains composed of a central chain and its nearest - neighbor chains instead of the cluster of @xmath12 sites . also , etxebarria @xmath14 @xmath15.@xcite proposed another extended bpw method and demonstrated that it yields a fairly accurate estimate of critical temperature for the square - lattice ising model .",
    "oguchi s method  @xcite is a more straightforward way to improve the results of the mft . in this method",
    ", one considers a cluster consisting of @xmath16 neighboring spins .",
    "the interactions between the spins at the cluster edge and the outside spins are treated approximately as effective internal fields . calculating the average @xmath17 for each site in the cluster , one regards the mean value of them as the magnetization of the system , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "then the effective fields are determined self - consistently by the value of @xmath8 .",
    "clearly , the case of @xmath19 corresponds to the conventional mft .",
    "although it is expected that one can obtain closer results to the exact values as the size of the cluster @xmath16 is increased , this method has two shortcomings .",
    "first , one has to deal with a quite large cluster to get sufficiently accurate results . in practice , it is difficult to solve exactly the @xmath16-site problem of such a large cluster .",
    "second , since the system is divided into finite - size clusters , equivalence of all sites ( or periodicity of the system ) is generally lost with few exceptions .",
    "recently , wysin and kaplan@xcite made a significant improvement to the mft in a quite simple way .",
    "their `` self - consistent '' correlated field ( sccf ) approximation remains basically the same as the standard mft in the sense that one deals with effective one - site problems . in this method ,",
    "the effective field acting on a central spin from its surrounding spins takes two different values @xmath20 , depending on the state of the spin itself ( @xmath21 or @xmath5 ) . here",
    "@xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is the average value of the spin on a first - shell site when the state of the central spin is fixed to be @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) . taking into account the effects of correlations between neighboring spins in this way",
    ", they obtained more accurate results of critical points compared with some other methods , such as the bpw approximation and the onsager reaction field ( orf ) correction.@xcite    in this paper , as an attempt to further improve these methods , we introduce a new cluster - based approximation method , which we refer to as the `` correlated cluster mean - field '' ( ccmf ) theory . depending on the lattice type , we select a cluster of a different size and shape . for example",
    ", the calculation for a square lattice model is based on square - shaped four - site ( @xmath24 ) clusters .",
    "clearly , the four sites in this cluster are equivalent by symmetry .",
    "additionally , to take into account the effects of the cluster - cluster correlations beyond the standard mean - field level , we use a similar idea as in the sccf method of ref .  .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in sec .  [ 2 ] , we demonstrate the application of our modified cluster mean - field theory to the ising model on several lattices . in sec .",
    "[ 3 ] , the accuracy of our method is verified by comparing the obtained results with those obtained by some other methods . in sec .  [ 4 ] , the cluster - size dependence of the results is discussed .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ 5 ] , taking the isotropic heisenberg model in a uniform field as an example , we extend our approach to quantum spin systems .",
    "finally , a summary is presented in sec .",
    "in the following , we shall demonstrate the application of our method to the ising model on typical four types of lattices ( honeycomb , triangular , square , and simple cubic ) one by one .      when the coordination number @xmath7 is @xmath25 , unfortunately , the sccf approximation yields a wrong result : the equation for @xmath26 has no solution.@xcite it is therefore important to verify whether the critical point can be calculated by applying our method to the case of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb lattice .",
    "we first divide the lattice into six - site hexagonal clusters as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a )",

    "the bpw approximation , which was first applied to the isotropic heisenberg model by weiss in ref .  , gives a qualitatively incorrect behavior in the low - temperature region .",
    "this behavior becomes more pronounced at lower magnetic field strengths .",
    "therefore , when applied to other systems , the bpw method has a risk that one can not decide whether the behavior of the obtained results is an essential property of the system or an artifact of the approximation .",
    "the similar behavior in the low temperature region is also observed in the result of kikuchi s approximation . in the `` bethe - type '' or `` effective - field '' approaches , such as the bpw method  @xcite and its extended versions,@xcite the values of the effective fields ( and effective couplings ) are determined by the periodic boundary conditions and thus these approaches generally overestimate the correlation effects between the spins .",
    "the green s function method with the rpa decoupling approximation ( or `` tyablikov decoupling '' method ) is one of the most popular approximation schemes to deal with quantum spin systems .",
    "as is shown in the figure , the rpa is a good approximation over a wide temperature range .",
    "however , since the treatment for the ising term of the hamiltonian is identical to that of the mft , the approximation should get worse as the ising - type anisotropy of the system increases . especially , when the rpa scheme is applied to the ising model , the obtained results are the same as that of the mft .",
    "besides , a special attention is required in applying the rpa scheme to a relatively complicated system as is pointed out in our recent study.@xcite    in the `` weiss - type '' approaches , the effective fields are defined in terms of some kind of mean fields ( e.g. , @xmath6 in the simple mft ) , and those values are determined by the corresponding self - consistency conditions .",
    "oguchi s method , the sccf , and ccmf approaches are categorized into this group .",
    "these approaches generally underestimate the correlation effects between the spins and therefore overestimate the magnetization .",
    "the ccmf method also overestimates the magnetization as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , but the difference from the qmc data is much smaller than that of the mft .",
    "moreover , above a certain temperature ( @xmath106 ) , the accuracy exceeds that of the rpa scheme .",
    "the results obtained here and in sec .  [ 3 ] indicate that our ccmf method can give qualitatively ( and even quantitatively ) correct results over a wide range of temperature and strength of the exchange anisotropy .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a cluster - based mean - field approach , which we refer to as the ccmf theory and have demonstrated its applications to the ising and isotropic heisenberg models as examples . by using the ccmf approach , one can take into account the effects of spin correlations between clusters beyond the standard mean - field level .",
    "since a cluster of different size and shape is used for each lattice type , the obtained results are dependent not only on the coordination number @xmath7 but also on the geometry of the lattice .",
    "the results obtained from the ccmf method are in good agreement with the corresponding exact values , series expansion , or qmc data for the both ising and isotropic heisenberg models .",
    "especially , for the ising model on the honeycomb and square lattices , the calculated results of the critical temperature are very close ( overestimated by only a few percent ) to the exact ones .    as well as being very accurate",
    ", the advantage of this method is that it is widely applicable . since the calculation in the ccmf approach",
    "is based on clusters consisting of several spins , in addition to the ising - type interaction , the contributions of other types of interactions ( e.g. , the heisenberg - type exchange interaction as we demonstrated ) can be taken into account in a straightforward way .",
    "although we have considered here only the two simple cases , this method is expected to be useful also for studies of more complicated and interesting systems .",
    "for example , the ccmf method should work well for the _ xxz _ model ( heisenberg - ising model ) with easy - plane anisotropy  @xcite and , of course , with ising - type anisotropy , which lies between the two models we considered here .",
    "also , the extensions to systems with four - spin ( ring ) exchange interactions,@xcite higher spins , and random systems  @xcite should be considered in future studies .",
    "the author would like to thank s. kurihara for valuable comments and discussions .",
    "this work was supported by a grant - in - aid from the japan society for the promotion of science .",

    "<S> a cluster mean - field method is introduced and the applications to the ising and heisenberg models are demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> we divide the lattice sites into clusters whose size and shape are selected so that the equivalence of all sites in a cluster is preserved . since the strength of interactions of a cluster with its surrounding clusters is strongly dependent on the spin configuration of the central cluster itself , we include this contribution in the effective fields acting on the spins . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of `` correlations '' between clusters can be taken into account beyond the standard mean - field level , and as a result our cluster - based method gives qualitatively ( and even quantitatively ) correct results for the both ising and heisenberg models . </S>",
    "<S> especially , for the ising model on the honeycomb and square lattices , the calculated results of the critical temperature are very close ( overestimated by only less than @xmath0 % ) to the exact values . </S>"
