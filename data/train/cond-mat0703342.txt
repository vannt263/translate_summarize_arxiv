    "since shor and grover algorithms @xcite were proposed with various following significant developments , e.g. , @xcite , quantum computing has been displaying its more and more amazing charm against classical computing .",
    "as more progress has been made in this area , it is urgent to discover various robust , controllable and scalable two - level systems - qubits as the basic elements for the future architecture of quantum computers .",
    "generally speaking , electron spins are a natural qubit , especially the single electron spin confined in a quantum dot for its well separation and easy addressability . in ref .",
    "@xcite , electron spins in quantum dots were employed as qubits and two - qubit operations were performed by pulsing the electrostatic barrier between neighboring spins .",
    "thereafter , kane s model made use of the nuclear spins of @xmath0p donor impurities in silicon as qubits @xcite .",
    "it combined the long decoherence time of nuclear spins and the advantage of the well developed modern semiconductor industry .    in practice",
    ", it seems difficult to control the coupling between qubits because the coupling is based on the overlap of two adjacent spin wave functions @xcite ; the coupling is given to be fixed once photolithography of the chip has been finished .",
    "another feasible way to induce the controllable inter - spin interaction is to couple two spins by spin - orbit interaction @xcite .",
    "however , because of the weakness of spin - orbit coupling , it is very crucial to find a scheme to manipulate two spin coupling in the strong interaction regime . in the present paper ,",
    "we consider the possibility of creating quantum entanglement of two electron spins by making them pass through a 2d quantum well containing many `` cooled '' nuclear spins ( see fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) .",
    "it was discovered that the effective coupling intensity is increased by a factor of @xmath1 when an electron spin is coupled with an ensemble of @xmath2 nuclear spins @xcite .",
    "such an electron spin coupled to the nuclei has been considered for cooling the nuclear ensemble @xcite .",
    "moreover , people have proposed a quantum computing scheme using a scanning tunneling microscopy with a moving tip as a commuter to perform the control - not gate between two qubits on the silicon surface @xcite . here , the tip plays the role of the quantum data bus to coherently link the qubits .",
    "enlightened by these works , we suggest a new scheme to entangle two electron spins by a tip since it can be modeled as an ensemble of many spins @xcite .",
    "indeed , when the couplings of the spin to the nuclear ensemble are quasi - homogeneous , the interaction between the electron spin and the collective excitation of nuclear spins can be well described in terms of artificial cavity qed @xcite . here , the collective excitation can behave as a single mode boson to realize a quantum data bus , while the electron spin acts as a two - level artificial atom . with the frequency selection due to the resonance effect",
    ", there is only one mode of collective excitations interacting with the two spins .",
    "especially , when the zeeman splits of all nuclear spins are the same , the single mode excitation can decouple with other modes @xcite .",
    "then , the coupling system with two qubit spins and nuclear ensemble just acts as a typical cavity qed system or spin - boson system . to coherently manipulate the indirect interaction between the two spins , which is induced by",
    "the above mentioned collective excitation , we need to let two electrons go through the quantum well to realize a two qubit logical gate operation . since the moving of electrons leads to a time - dependent coupling , we need to use some new method to derive the effective hamiltonian for the inter - spin coupling .",
    "fortunately , a recent paper suggested such a time - dependent approach @xcite .",
    "the rest of our paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , in the low excitation limit , we simplify the total system we considered above as two spins interacting with a single mode of the collective excitation of the nuclei , which forms a cavity - qed under the quasihomogeneous condition . in sec .",
    "iii , we derive the effective hamiltonian between the two electron spins by the time - dependent frhlich transformation ( tdft ) method developed recently in ref.@xcite .",
    "we remark that the tdft method can be used to derive an effective hamiltonian for a class of cavity qed systems with time - dependent perturbations . here",
    ", we use this transformation for the case with time - dependent couplings of two spins to a many spin ensemble .",
    "section iv contains the discussion of entanglement induced by the effective hamiltonian and collective excitation s effect on the entanglement . in sec .",

    "the 2d quantum well consists of many polarized nuclear spins located in position @xmath7 with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "when a static magnetic field is applied to the total system , the hamiltonian reads as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) ( @xmath15 ) are the spin operators for the @xmath16th electron spin , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) ( @xmath20 ) the spin operators for the @xmath21th nuclear spin , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) the hyperfine coupling constants between @xmath16th electron and @xmath21th nuclear spin .",

    "in fig . [ v1_total ] , the concurrence is plotted while the speed @xmath3 and the initial distance between the two electrons @xmath147 are varied .",
    "it is obvious that the concurrence fluctuates from @xmath148 to @xmath138 in the low speed region ( see also fig .",
    "[ v1_sectional ] ) .",
    "when the electrons move with a relative low speed , the concurrence oscillates rapidly since a lower speed means more time for evolution from a direct product state towards an entangled state . as the speed increases ,",
    "the concurrence falls monotonously if it is bigger than a certain value .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) , the maximum entangled state can be obtained when @xmath149however , the general relation between the concurrence and @xmath150 is a little more complicated .",

    "drop dramatically as the inter - spin distance increases .",
    "this observation is obviously correct from an intuitively physical consideration . for a longer inter - spin distance ,",
    "the spatial wave function of two spins has a smaller overlap , and then the effective coupling is weak .    in the last section ,",
    "we have only taken @xmath111 into consideration . however , due to the nuclear excitation , i.e. , @xmath152 , @xmath100 will lead to decoherence . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , under the quasihomogeneous condition , we have @xmath153 , where @xmath154 , @xmath155 is the average number of collective excitation .",
    "thus , the single particle perturbation can be approximated as @xmath156 in fig .",
    "[ v1_v1+v2 ] , we plot the concurrence evolution under @xmath157 . as shown in the figure , the two spins evolve into a maximum entangled state with appropriate parameters when @xmath145 . on the contrary ,",
    "the concurrence is suppressed when there exists collective excitation in the nuclei . moreover , as more nuclei are excited , the concurrence falls dramatically .     on condition that @xmath158 nm , @xmath159 hz , @xmath33 , @xmath160 mm / s.,width=7 ]",
    "in summary , we have proposed a scheme to entangle two electron spins via an ensemble of nuclei .",
    "we also explore the influence of its collective excitation on the concurrence characterizing two spin entanglement .",
    "theoretically , the maximum entangled state can be obtained if the electrons move in a suitable way .",
    "furthermore , with the optimized experimental parameters , the operation time is within the relaxation time of electron spins in solid state systems , i.e. , the order of ms @xcite .",
    "however , this scheme may encounter some difficulties in practice since it is based on the low excitation requirement of nuclear ensemble . in recent experiments ,",
    "the number of excitation @xmath161 is of the order of @xmath162 bracker .",
    "thus , further progress in experiment , i.e. , lowering the temperature or optical excitation , are expected to prepare all nuclear spins in their ground states in order to put this scheme into practice .",
    "actually , there are only the collective excitations considered as the quantum data bus to coherently link two spins so that the inter - spin entanglement is induced .",
    "if there exists noncollective excitations , then extra decoherence will be induced to break our scheme presented in this paper .",
    "further investigations are needed for these questions . however ,",
    "if we can cool the nuclear ensemble via some new mechanism , e.g. , similar to ref.@xcite , our scheme will probably work well .",
