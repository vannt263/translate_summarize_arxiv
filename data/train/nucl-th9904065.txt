    "double beta decay has been long recognized as a powerful tool for the study of lepton conservation .",
    "the theoretical description of @xmath0 decay involves particle physics and nuclear structure physics .",
    "the latter is the topic of the present work . after a brief introduction and a review of the experimental situation",
    "i will describe three distinct set of problems :    * @xmath3 decay : the physics of the gamow - teller amplitudes . *",
    "@xmath1 decay - exchange of light massive majorana neutrinos : no selection rules on multipoles , role of nucleon correlations , sensitivity to nuclear models . * @xmath1 decay - exchange of heavy neutrinos : physics of the nucleon - nucleon states at short distances .",
    "since the lifetimes of @xmath0 decay are so long , the experimental search has spawned a whole field of experiments requiring very low background . during the last decade",
    "there has been enormous progress in the experimental study of the double beta decay .",
    "the @xmath3 decay , with lifetimes of @xmath4 y , has been now observed in ten cases , often repeatedly and by different groups @xcite .",
    "the halflives are typically determined to better than 10% accuracy .",
    "thus , the @xmath3 decay has become a tool , rather than an exotic curiosity .",
    "the main experimental effort is concentrated , naturally , on the search for the @xmath1 decay .",
    "there , multikilogram sources with very low background are the state of the art at present .",
    "various techniques are being pursued : two large experimental efforts ( heidelberg - moscow collaboration in gran sasso and the igex collaboration in canfranc ) employ enriched @xmath5ge in sets of detectors operated deep underground .",
    "the latest result @xcite is based on 41.55 kg y of exposure and halflife limit @xmath6y ( 90% cl ) . alternatively , the analysis of the 24.16 kg y of data with pulse shape measurement , and hence improved background suppression , leads to even better limit of @xmath7y ( 90% cl ) . note , that in the latter case the actual number of observed events is smaller than the expected background .",
    "when taking advantage of this , the authors of @xcite report yet much improved limit of @xmath8y ( 90% cl ) .",
    "the latest igex limit is @xmath9y ( 90% cl)@xcite .",
    "i will discuss the interpretation of this result in terms of the neutrino majorana mass below in section 3 .",
    "other techniques which allow expansions to multikilogram sources involve gas tpc ( @xmath10xe in the gotthardt tunnel @xcite ) , electron tracking detectors combined with calorimeters ( nemo @xcite , elegants @xcite ) , and cryogenic bolometers @xcite .",
    "these experiments will make it possible ( or currently already achieve ) to reach neutrino mass limit well below 1 ev .",
    "in addition , there are plans for improvements of the limit to the 0.1 ev range by scaling up the source mass to about one ton quantities . such experiments , with either enriched @xmath5ge ( genius ) or with large amount of cooled teo@xmath11 ( cuore ) will require very large capital expenditures and running times of about five years .",
    "the field of @xmath0 decay then becomes competitive , in complexity , manpower , and price , to large accelerator particle physics experiments .",
    "the majorana neutrino mass @xmath2 below 1 ev is an important landmark .",
    "this has been stressed often , e.g. , in the work of georgi and glashow @xcite .",
    "there , the authors quote as `` established facts '' the discovery by the superkamiokande collaboration of the @xmath12 neutrino oscillations with @xmath13 ev@xmath14 and mixing angle @xmath15 , and the solar neutrino deficit , confirmed in five experiments , which involves @xmath16 oscillations with @xmath17 ev@xmath14 .",
    "the `` tentative facts '' are based on theoretical prejudices and need experimental confirmation .",
    "they are the existence of precisely three massive majorana neutrinos , and the assumption that these neutrinos are responsible for the hot dark matter , leading to the conclusion that @xmath18 ev .",
    "taking all of that together one is forced to the wholly unexpected and somewhat bizarre conclusion that the three neutrino flavors are essentially degenerate with masses of 2 ev each ( albeit with a sizable uncertainty in this value ) .",
    "it is now clear that if the study of the @xmath1 @xmath0 decay can without doubt establish that @xmath19 ev , this finding has a profound consequences for the structure of the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "in particular , as georgi and glashow @xcite argue , it would lead to maximum mixing involving electron neutrinos also .",
    "this decay , characterized by the transformation of two neutrons into two protons with the emission of two electrons and two @xmath20 , does not violate any selection rules .",
    "since the energies involved are modest , the allowed approximation should be applicable , and the rate is governed by the double gamow - teller matrix element @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the ground states in the initial and final nuclei , and @xmath23 are the intermediate @xmath24 ( virtual ) states in the odd - odd nucleus .",
    "the first factor in the numerator above represents the @xmath25 ( or ( @xmath26 ) ) amplitude for the final nucleus , while the second one represents the @xmath27 ( or ( @xmath28 ) ) amplitude for the initial nucleus .",
    "thus , in order to correctly evaluate the @xmath3 decay rate , we have to know , at least in principle , _ all _ gt amplitudes for both @xmath27 and @xmath25 processes , including their signs .",
    "the difficulty is that the @xmath3 matrix element exhausts a very small fraction ( @xmath29 ) of the double gt sum rule @xcite , and hence it is sensitive to details of nuclear structure .",
    "various approaches used in the evaluation of the @xmath3 decay rate have been reviewed recently by suhonen and civitarese @xcite .",
    "the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) has been the most popular theoretical tool in the recent past .",
    "its main ingredients , the repulsive particle - hole spin - isospin interaction , and the attractive particle - particle interaction , clearly play a decisive role in the concentration of the @xmath27 strength in the giant gt resonance , and the relative suppression of the @xmath25 strength and its concentration at low excitation energies .",
    "together , these two ingredients are able to explain the suppression of the @xmath3 matrix element when expressed in terms of the corresponding sum rule .    yet",
    ", the qrpa is often criticized .",
    "two `` undesirable '' , and to some extent unrelated , features are usually quoted .",
    "one is the extreme sensitivity of the decay rate to the strength of the particle - particle force ( often denoted as @xmath30 ) .",
    "this decreases the predictive power of the method .",
    "the other one is the fact that for a realistic value of @xmath30 the qrpa solutions are close to their critical value ( so - called collapse ) .",
    "this indicates a phase transition , i.e. , a rearrangement of the nuclear ground state .",
    "qrpa is meant to describe small deviations from the unperturbed ground state , and thus is not fully applicable near the point of collapse .",
    "numerous approaches have been made to extend the range of validity of qrpa , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the description of all these generalizations is beyond the scope of this talk .    .",
    "experimental halflives of the @xmath3 decay , and the ratios of calculated to experimental halflives ( see text ) . [ cols=\"<,<,<,^ \" , ]     [ tab:0nu ]",
    "the neutrinoless @xmath0 decay can be also mediated by the exchange of a heavy neutrino .",
    "the decay rate is then inversely proportional to the square of the effective neutrino mass @xcite . in this context",
    "it is particularly interesting to consider the left - right symmetric model proposed by mohapatra @xcite . in it",
    ", one can find a relation between the mass of the heavy neutrino @xmath31 and the mass of the right - handed vector boson @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the limit on the @xmath0 rate provides , within that specific model , a stringent lower limit on the mass of @xmath32 .",
    "the process then involves the emission of the heavy @xmath33 by the first neutron , the vertex @xmath34 followed by @xmath35 with the absorption of the @xmath36 on the second neutron .",
    "since all exchanged particles between the two neutrons are very heavy , the corresponding `` neutrino potential '' is of essentially zero range .",
    "hence , when calculating the nuclear matrix element , one has to take into account carefully the short range nucleon - nucleon repulsion .",
    "as long as we treat the nucleus as an ensemble of nucleons only , the only way to have a nonvanishing nuclear matrix elements for the above process is to treat the nucleons as finite size particles .",
    "in fact , that is the standard way to approach the problem @xcite ; the nucleon size is described by a dipole form factor with the cut - off parameter @xmath37 0.85 gev .",
    "however , another way of treating the problem is possible , and already mentioned in @xcite .",
    "let us recall how the analogous situation is treated in the description of the parity - violating nucleon - nucleon force @xcite .",
    "there , instead of the weak ( i.e. , very short range ) interaction of two nucleons , one assumes that a meson ( @xmath38 ) is emitted by one nucleon and absorbed by another one .",
    "one of the vertices is the parity - violating one , and the other one is the usual parity - conserving strong one .",
    "the corresponding range is then just the meson exchange range , easily treated .",
    "the situation is schematically depicted in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : moh ] .",
    "the analogy for @xmath0 decay is shown in the right - hand graph .",
    "it involves two pions , and the `` elementary '' lepton number violating @xmath0 decay then involves a transformation of two pions into two electrons . again",
    ", the range is just the pion exchange range . to my knowledge ,",
    "no detailed evaluation of the corresponding graph was ever made ( see , however , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it would be interesting to see if it would lead to a more or less stringent limit on the mass of the @xmath32 than the treatment with form factors .",
    "it is my pleasant duty to thank prof .",
    "christianne miehe for organizing the workshop and inviting me to strasbourg . the permission of etienne caurier and frederick nowacki to use their results is greatly appreciated .",
