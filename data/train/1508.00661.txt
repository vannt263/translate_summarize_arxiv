    "<S> due to the absence of degeneracy in one dimension , when a parameter , @xmath0 , of a potential is varied slowly the discrete energy eigenvalue curves , @xmath1 , can not cross but they are allowed to come quite close and diverge from each other . this phenomena is called avoided crossing of energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> the parametric evolution of eigenvalues of the generally known one dimensional potentials do not display avoided crossings and on the other hand some complicated and analytically unsolvable models do exhibit this . here , we show that this interesting spectral property can be found in simple one - dimensional double - wells when width of one of them is varied slowly .    in two or more dimensions , evolution of energy eigenvalues as one parameter ( @xmath0 ) of the system </S>",

    "<S> 1(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the former indicates degeneracy ( equality of eigenvalues of two linearly independent states of one hamiltonian ) , the latter is called avoided crossing ( ac ) . in a system , more frequent occurrence of ac is debated to be the signature of quantum chaos [ 1 ] and non - integrability of the hamiltonian ( non - separability of a hamiltonian , @xmath3 , in various dimensions ) . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the eigenvalues of a particle in a two dimensional rectangular box as a function of the ratio of length to breath ( l / b ) show crossings as its hamiltonian is separable in @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> but if one small corner of this rectangle is snipped off , the eigenvalues show avoided crossings [ 2 ] because hamiltonian is no more separable in @xmath4 @xmath6 @xmath5 or in some other special co - ordinates : @xmath7 @xmath6 @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> avoided crossings are known to be responsible for surprisingly low energy landau - zener [ 3 ] transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> crossings and avoided crossings of eigenvalues can also be understood in terms of time independent perturbation theory at the textbook level . when a perturbation is switched on , the degeneracy of levels ( when @xmath9 ) is lifted and they split into two or more levels ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ) . similarly , two un - perturbed levels @xmath10 and @xmath11 may split into sub - multiplets . </S>",
    "<S> sub - multiplets of different levels may cross ( see fig 1(a ) ) each other . </S>",
    "<S> however , the sub - multiplets of one level have the tendency to avoid and diverge from each other as the parameter @xmath0 is varied ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the zeeman splitting [ 3 ] of different total angular momentum(@xmath12 ) states under the magnetic field is one such example . </S>",
    "<S> the levels showing avoided crossing ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ) can also called nearly - degenerate(nearly equal ) levels and a perturbation widens the gap between them .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the evolution of energy levels of one - dimensional potentials under a slow change of the parameter is generally found to be uninteresting wherein all the levels increase / decrease monotonically without displaying avoided crossings or crossings ( due to absence of degeneracy ) . </S>",
    "<S> for instance see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) for the evolution of first four energy eigenvalues of infinitely deep potential of width @xmath13 . in this </S>",
    "<S> regard , the sub - barrier ( below the barrier ) energy levels of a symmetric double - well [ 3 ] potential are interesting which display the well known merging of two levels in to one as the height ( @xmath14 ) or the width ( @xmath15 ) of the in - barrier is increased . for moderate values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 the sub - barrier levels are closely lying doublets as in the classical case of ammonia molecule [ 3 ] .    presence of avoided crossings of energy levels in one - dimensional potentials has been addressed once [ 5 ] in extremely complex situations wherein the schrdinger equation becomes heun equation which can not be solved exactly and analytically . </S>",
    "<S> however elegant approximate treatments have been employed to display avoided crossings of eigenvalues even in one dimension . a recent book [ 6 ] is a rare avenue where the avoided crossings are well discussed and exhibited in piecewise constant one dimensional asymmetric double - well potentials of finite support in terms of inherent transmission resonances . </S>",
    "<S> these potentials of finite support represent open systems that can have all : scattering , bound and resonant states .    here , we present various analytically solvable asymmetric double well potentials with a fixed in - barrier . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these closed systems which support only bound states exhibit avoided crossing in one dimension when the width of one of the wells is varied slowly .    : </S>",

    "<S> notice that there is no crossing or avoided crossing of two levels.,title=\"fig:\",width=5,height=3 ]    in quantum mechanics , we solve the schrdinger equation : @xmath17 , there may or may not be a one to one correspondence between energy eigenvalues @xmath18 and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> for example for free particle case when @xmath20 , for one real positive energy @xmath21 , there are two eigenstates @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly in the presence of a potential , @xmath25 for real positive energy continuum there are two states @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> however in one dimension for bound states of a potential this correspondence is strictly one to one as an eigenstate has to satisfy the dirichlet boundary condition : @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the schrdinger equation being second order differential equation @xmath29\\psi(x)=0\\ ] ] there exist two linearly independent solutions </S>",
    "<S> . however , usually only one of them satisfies the said boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> further , it can be proved that even if there are two solutions : @xmath30 and @xmath31 for one fixed discrete energy then they are only trivially different as they would be linearly dependent ( see appendix 1 ) .     </S>",
    "<S> on the left is more than that of right , title=\"fig:\",width=3,height=5 ] .5 cm   on the left is more than that of right , title=\"fig:\",width=3,height=5 ] .5 cm   on the left is more than that of right , title=\"fig:\",width=3,height=5 ] .5 cm   on the left is more than that of right , title=\"fig:\",width=3,height=5 ]    interestingly , it requires two or more dimensions for degeneracy to occur where energy eigenvalues for separable potentials is a function of two positive integers @xmath32 and @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance in the case of particle in a two dimensional square box of length @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , we have i.e. , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is four - fold degenerate as @xmath38 the corresponding eigenstates are @xmath39 and @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this is called accidental degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> additional degeneracies arise from the symmetries of hamiltonian . for example </S>",
    "<S> , we can have two more eigenstates due to the symmetry of hamiltonian under @xmath41 as @xmath42 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> a two dimensional hamiltonian may not be ( apparently ) separable in @xmath4 and @xmath5 then quantum numbers @xmath32 and @xmath33 loose meaning and eigenvalues are found by semi - classical methods like periodic orbit theory [ 1 ] .    in more than one dimensions </S>",
    "<S> when eigenvalues are studied by varying a parameter smoothly and slowly , @xmath44 evolve and may become wavy curves rising up and lowering down having crossings and avoided crossings . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues of anisotropic harmonic oscillator as a function of anisotropy parameter is a simple example where eigenvalue curves are slant straight lines [ 4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> nilsen s [ 4 ] modified anisotropic harmonic oscillator model of deformed nuclei displays all raising and lowering , crossings and avoided crossings of energy levels as a function of the deformation parameter . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , this explains the observed nuclear magic numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the similar phenomena are also found in quantum dots .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the first few energy levels of a double well potential are closely lying doublets below or around the height of the in - barrier . </S>",
    "<S> we bring out a scenario wherein the wells of the same depth but different width display avoided crossings when the width of one of the wells is varied slowly ( adiabatically ) . </S>",
    "<S> suppose in a symmetric double well potential , we have two very close energy eigenvalues , when the width parameter is increased or reduced slightly these two levels would diverge from each other to display avoided crossing , what is counter intuitive is the occurrence of ac when the asymmetry is large . </S>",
