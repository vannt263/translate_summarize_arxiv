    "the 3300 - 9100   spectra of sth@xmath0  190 and mkk standards in mz01 allows us to classify the cool giant as g7  iii . comparing mhz photometry with the intrinsic colours from fitzgerald ( 1970 ) and absolute magnitudes from schmidt - kaler ( 1982 )",

    "sn93 estimated an identical @xmath25=0.10 from the 2175  interstellar hump in the iue spectra of sth@xmath0  190 .",
    "multiple interstellar components are superposed on the rotationally broadened stellar nai doublet ( cf .",
    "figure  1 ) .",
    "their rv@xmath27 are @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 km  sec@xmath1 , with 0.159 , 0.051 and 0.112 ( @xmath310.003 )   as equivalent widths for the 5889 component , respectively .",
    "they are unresolved on the asiago spectra and the blend has rv@xmath32 km  sec@xmath1 .",
    "sth@xmath0  190 is at @xmath33 so our line - of - sight exits the galactic dust layer ( assumed to reach @xmath34 pc over the galactic plane ) at the projected distance of @xmath15170 pc , where the effect of the galactic rotation on the radial velocity does not exceed 2 km  sec@xmath1 .",
    "none of the three interstellar lines shares the velocity of the sth@xmath0  190 circumstellar material ( see bottom line in tab .  1 ) , so they have to originate in distinct clouds with rv dispersion similar to that of extreme pop  i objects ( 12.5 km  sec@xmath1 , binney & merrifield 1998 ) .",
    "if we use the nai vs. @xmath25 calibration of munari & zwitter ( 1997 ) , the equivalent widths of the three interstellar nai components correspond to @xmath35 , 0.016 and 0.035 , respectively , giving a total @xmath36 , a value identical to what above derived by independent methods .",
    "heliocentric velocities of the main emission lines and the stellar nai absorption which traces the g7  iii star are listed in table  1 .",
    "the fairly constant rv@xmath27 of emission lines indicates that their formation regions do not follow the orbital motion and are circumstellar in origin .",
    "the stellar nai doublet clearly shows orbital motion velocity shifts , even if the observations did not cover a full orbital cycle .",
    "lower limit to the velocity amplitude ( @xmath3730 km sec@xmath1 ) is remarkable for a symbiotic star and it is the largest recorded so far ( see tab .  4 of belczyski et al .",
    "this suggests a large orbital inclination , an unusually massive hot companion and a short orbital period .",
    "sth@xmath0  190 has been detected by tycho at the limit of its sensitivity range during 78 passages distributed over 17 dates ( from dec 27 , 1989 to dec 14 , 1992 ) .",
    "automatic analysis of tycho data summarized in the hipparcos catalogue did not detected variability of sth@xmath0  190 over the large noise in the @xmath38 and @xmath39 data .",
    "our recent ir photometry reported in sect .",
    "2 is in excellent agreement with the older w95 data .    however , if a detailed search for variability and periodicities is performed on tycho and w95 data as well as on the radial velocities of table  1 , an average periodicity of 171  @xmath315 days ( and its 115  @xmath317 yearly alias ) is found . if this corresponds to the orbital period it would be the shortest known among all symbiotic stars , followed by those of two other yellow symbiotics tx cvn ( 199 days ) and bd-21.3873 ( 282 days ) and the recurrent symbiotic nova t  crb ( 228 days ; cf . belczyski et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the width of the stellar nai absorption lines in figure  1 corresponds to @xmath40 sin@xmath41105 km sec@xmath1 , which translates into a 5 days rotation period for the g7  iii star , much less than the possible 171 day orbital period .",
    "such a rotational velocity is very high : from the catalogue of rotational velocities of bernacca & perinotto ( 1973 ) the mean value for the 288 giants between g2 k2 is @xmath40=9.7 km  sec@xmath1 , with 92% of them having @xmath4210 km  sec@xmath1 .",
    "the high @xmath40 sin@xmath43 further strengthens the idea of a high orbital inclination for sth@xmath0  190 .",
    "figure  2 presents the temporal evolution of hei 5876   emission line profile as a template for other helium lines , h@xmath0 for hydrogen , and [ oiii ] for the nebular lines . over the observational period",
    "no other substantial change affected the spectrum of sth@xmath0  190 .",
    "the h@xmath0 profile is dominated by a central component that has remained remarkably constant over the last four mounts ( see table  1 ) .",
    "two weaker and symmetrically placed components are flanking the central component .",
    "they show large day - to - day variability in both @xmath44 and width ( cf . table  1 ) . we identify them as spectral signatures of jet - like discrete ejection events .",
    "weak p - cyg absorptions interfere with the blue jet component , reducing its width and its velocity shift vs. the main h@xmath0 component .",
    "orbital inclination of sth@xmath0  190 is probably high , so the de - projected velocity of the jet components must be much larger than the observed velocity shifts ( @xmath15150 km  sec@xmath1 ) and well in excess of the escape velocity from the o sub - dwarf companion to the g7  iii ( @xmath151000 km  sec@xmath1 ) .",
    "the mass of the gas originating the jets is @xmath45 , while the circumstellar ionized region has @xmath46 and @xmath47 cm = 30 au ( assuming a simple spherically symmetric geometry ) .",
    "the mass loss rate necessary to sustain the jets is _",
    "m _ @xmath48 .",
    "the jet components are visible in the profiles of hei lines too ( see hei  5876   in figure  2 ) .",
    "the velocity and profile of the red component corresponds closely to that seen in the h@xmath0 profile .",
    "the most outstanding feature of the hei profile is however the multi - component and highly variable p - cyg component , with terminal velocity even in excess of 300 km  sec@xmath1 .",
    "the p - cyg absorption can be so strong as to completely overwhelm the jet s blue component .",
    "the p - cyg profiles evolve on a few days or hours time scale .",
    "the strong p - cyg component on sept .  9 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , for example , accelerated outward by 20 km  sec@xmath1 day@xmath1 and dissolved in the next two days , while being replaced by a growing and accelerating new p - cyg component . the typical mass involved in the absorption profiles is @xmath49 .",
    "the relative appearance of hydrogen and hei lines in sth@xmath0  190 closely resembles hen  3 - 1341 and its well developed jets and mass outflow ( tomov et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we are continuing with the photometric and spectroscopic monitoring and a detailed modeling of sth@xmath0  190 will be presented elsewhere .",
