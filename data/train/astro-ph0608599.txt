    "4u 182030 is a low mass x - ray binary seen at 0.66@xmath6 from the centre of the globular cluster ngc 6624 .",
    "it was the first identified source of type - i x - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "distance has been estimated as @xmath78.0 kpc ( e.g. , shaposhikov & titarchuk 2004 ; kuulkers et al .",
    ". kuulkers et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found their determination of @xmath8 kpc compatible with the peak x - ray burst luminosity being a standard candle in their sample of sources , and equal to the eddington limit for he .",
    "the binary system consists of a he white dwarf with mass of 0.06@xmath9 @xcite and a neutron star , with the mass estimated by shaposhnikov & titarchuk as @xmath10 , orbiting at short period of 11.4 minutes @xcite . in x - rays , 4u 182030  is classified as an atoll @xcite .",
    "however , its flux variation between the soft ( banana ) to the hard ( island ) state are quasiperiodic at @xmath11170 d ( priedhorsky & terrell 1984 ; imon 2003 ; wen et al .",
    "2006 ) , which quasiperiodicity has been proposed to be due to tidal effects of a more remote third star ( chou & grindlay 2001 ; zdziarski , wen & gierliski 2006 ) .",
    "x - ray bursts occur only at low flux levels ( cornelisse et al .",
    "2003 ) and the khz qpos are correlated with the flux ( zhang et al .",
    "1998 ) , proving that the variability is due to an intrinsic change of the source luminosity ( and the accretion rate ) rather than being due to variable either obscuration or viewing angle of an anisotropic emitter .",
    "x - ray spectra of the source from _ rxte _ and _ bepposax _ were fitted by thermal comptonization with or without an additional blackbody ( bloser et al .",
    "2000 ; sidoli et al .",
    "2001 ; migliari et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in this paper , we report the first detection of x - ray emission above 50 kev from 4u 182030  in a hard spectral state .",
    "we studied the source in the 4200 kev energy range with the jem - x @xcite and ibis @xcite instruments on board the _ integral _ satellite @xcite , collected during the galactic centre deep exposure ( gcde ) program @xcite .",
    "we combined three methods of analysis : _ temporal _ , using the light curves in different energy bands ; _ photometric _ , with the hardness ",
    "instensity diagram ; and _ spectral _ , by spectral fitting .",
    "the coded mask imager ibis on board _ integral _ has a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath1219@xmath13 or @xmath14 when partially or fully coded , respectively .",
    "the x - ray monitor jem - x ( 435 kev ) has the fully coded fov of @xmath15",
    "integral _ revolution lasts 3 days , and consists of adjacent pointings of @xmath112000 s , called science windows ( scw ; winkler et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we have analysed all the available data during which the source was within the ibis / isgri and jem - x fully coded fov , so that the flux evaluation is not affected by calibration uncertainties in the off - axis response .",
    "this yields 308 and 51 scws for ibis and jem - x respectively , during revolutions 50363 .",
    "data were extracted with the off - line scientific analysis ( osa ) @xcite v.  5.1 software released by the _",
    "integral _ science data centre ( courvoisier et al .",
    "a 2% systematic errors to both jem - x and isgri data sets has been added .",
    "fluxes have been normalized to isgri value .",
    "the spectral analysis was performed with the xspec package v.  11.3 .",
    "fig .  [ plotone ] shows the light curves of the monitoring period ( 2003 march 122005 october 5 ) from soft to hard x - rays , in the 410 , 1020 kev bands from jem - x and 2030 , 3060 , 60120 kev with ibis / isgri , as well as the corresponding _ rxte_/asmlc.html . ]",
    "light curve .",
    "the @xmath11170-d quasiperiodic variability can be seen in the asm data .",
    "the _ integral _ light curves are marked with vertical lines to identify five epochs ( a , b , c , d , e ) during which we have performed detailed spectral analysis ( see table [ tab_dataset ] ) .",
    "epoch a corresponds to the joint ibis and jem - x count rate maximum ( @xmath11530 mcrab at 410 kev ) .",
    "epoch c corresponds to the minimum of the 410 kev count rate ( @xmath11100 mcrab ) , but to high count rates from 20 to 60 kev , implying a spectral hardening across the 460 kev band .",
    "we also studied epochs before ( b ) , and after that event ( d , e ) .",
    "[ plottwo ] shows hardness ",
    "intensity diagrams with data from jem - x ( a ) and ibis / jem - x ( b ) ( for simultaneous pointing and when possible because of different fov ) . in figs .",
    "[ plottwo ] we can see the banana state , forming nearly horizontal bands across the a , b , d , e epochs . thus , the source evolution is mostly in the flux , with the 420 kev spectral shape nearly constant .",

    "[ plottwo]a corresponds to the island state . in this case",
    "the 420 kev flux is almost constant while the hardness shows large changes .",
    "this indicates spectral pivoting somewhere in this energy band .",
    "[ plottwo]b allows us to study spectral variability of the source at the energy band 1030 kev , grater than that usually studied . in this diagram",
    ", we see similar behaviour in the horizontal banana state , while there is only one scw for the island state , with a large hard colour .",
    "these findings are confirmed by spectral analysis as discussed below .",
    "data of the five epochs ( see table [ tab_dataset ] ) have been fitted with a number of models and their combinations , namely , thermal and hybrid comptonization , blackbody , disk blackbody and a power law , all absorbed by the interstellar medium at @xmath16 @xmath17 ( bloser et al .",
    "first , a thermal comptonization model , comptt ( titarchuk 1994 ) , sufficiently model the spectra of the banana states ( a , b , d , e ) .",
    "we obtain the electron temperature , @xmath183.1 kev , and optical depth @xmath197 , as reported in table [ tabspetot ] .",
    "this is consistent with the colour - intensity diagram , where we found the spectral changes mostly in flux ( most likely proportional to the accretion rate ) and only slightly in their shape .",
    "the temperatures of the seed photons ( table [ tabspetot ] ) have been frozen at their best - fit values , given that those photons are entirely below the fitted band .",
    "the data , model , and residuals for the spectrum a ( characterized by highest flux and unabsorbed bolometric luminosity of @xmath20 erg s@xmath21 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ plotthree]a , b , and all unabsorbed models , in fig .",
    "[ plotfour ] .",
    "an addition of a blackbody component does not significantly improve the fits ( although its presence is hinted by the negative residuals at the lowest energies , fig .",
    "[ plotthree]b ) , and thus the confidence ranges of the temperature , @xmath22 , are not constrained .",
    "still , we find @xmath232.4 kev at the best fits , in agreement with previous study of bloser et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "the spectrum of the island state ( c , red ) shows an evident excess above 50 kev that can not be fitted by thermal comptonization only , as shown in fig .",
    "[ plotthree]e ( the resulted @xmath24 is 1.6 with 59 d.o.f . ) .",
    "an addition of a soft ( @xmath25 ) power law improves the fit significantly ( @xmath26 , see figs .",
    "[ plotthree]c , d ) , with the chance probability from the f - test ( bevington & robinson 1992 ) of @xmath27 .",
    "the parameters of the thermal plasma are also different from those for the banana state , with a higher @xmath28 ( @xmath29 kev ) , and a lower @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , see table [ tabspetot ] . fig .",
    "[ plotfour ] shows the unabsorbed spectrum with its two components . by adding a disk blackbody component ( mitsuda et al .  1984 ) to the thermal compton model , we have also obtained a good fit , with @xmath32 .",
    "however , the required inner temperature , @xmath33 kev , is clearly unphysical . whereas adding a single blackbody gave a worse fit , as well as an unphysically high temperature , @xmath31 kev .",
    "we have investigated whether the tail can be an artefact of calibration inaccuracies . analysing the data with previous software version of the osa ,",
    "the statistical significance of tail remains unchanged .",
    "the island - state data ( c ) have been fitted also with the highly - accurate comptonization model compps ( poutanen & svensson 1996 ) .",
    "spectra agree very well with results from monte carlo comptonization ( zdziarski et al .",
    "2000 , 2003 ) .",
    "we assumed here spherical geometry of the comptonizing plasma .",
    "also , we have taken into account compton reflection ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) detected in other atolls ( e.g. , zdziarski , lubiski & smith 1999 ; barret et al .",
    "2000 ; gierliski & done 2002 ) , as well as a disk blackbody .",
    "we have obtained a very good fit , @xmath24(d.o.f.)@xmath34 for a purely - thermal comptonizing plasma with @xmath35 kev and @xmath36 , and the solid angle subtended by reflector of @xmath37 ( assuming the source inclination of @xmath38 ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of this model is @xmath39 erg s@xmath21 .",
    "however , similar to the problem with the model using comptt ( see above ) , the inner disk temperature is rather high , @xmath40 kev , as well as the temperature of the seed blackbody photons upscattered in the comptonizing plasma is unphysically high , @xmath41 kev .    in order to constrain the model to plausible values of the blackbody temperatures ,",
    "we have considered a model with @xmath42 allowed to be @xmath43 kev . also , we have constrained @xmath44 .",
    "the resulting purely - thermal model provides a worse fit , @xmath24(d.o.f.)@xmath45 , with @xmath46 kev , @xmath47 , @xmath48 kev , similar to the parameters found in the atoll source 4u 160852 ( gierliski & done 2002 ) . to improve the fit of this model , in particular to account for the high - energy residuals ( appearing as a high - energy tail )",
    ", we have added nonthermal electrons to the thermal plasma , as done to account for some spectra of both black - hole ( gierliski et al .",
    "1999 ; wardziski et al .  2002 ) and neutron - star ( farinelli et al .",
    "2005 ) binaries .",
    "we have obtained @xmath49(d.o.f.)@xmath50 for a model with the nonthermal tail with the power - law index of @xmath51 above the electron lorentz factor of 1.6 ( and the maxwellian distribution below it ) , and other parameters similar to that of the previous model .",
    "we stress , however , that this model is significantly more complex than the one with comptt and a power law presented above , and still yields significant residuals at energies @xmath52 kev .",
    "we have presented the first detection of hard emission above 50 kev in the island state of the atoll source 4u 182030  using ibis . up to now , 4u",
    "182030  has not been included in the sample of the high - energy emitting bursters @xcite and indeed neither _ bepposax _ , _ cgro_/batse nor _ rxte _ detected this source above 50 kev ( bloser et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the previous lack of detection might have been due to either the source spending most of the time in the soft state , the weakness of the emission above 50 kev in the island state , or the strong emission at @xmath53 kev appearing in that state only occasionally .    in our island - state observation , the relative flux contribution for energies @xmath54 kev is @xmath1110% .",
    "the ratio of the 420 kev flux to the 20120 kev ones is @xmath112 , whereas it is in the range 2027 for the soft ( banana ) state .",
    "we point out that we detected emission above 50 kev when the 120 kev luminosity was @xmath55 erg s@xmath21 , i.e. , close or somewhat below the critical value at which the x - ray binaries become hard emitters as proposed by barret et al .",
    "( 1996 , 2000 ) .",
    "while the origin of the thermal comptonization component in the soft state appears well understood as emission from hot electrons that upscatter soft photons coming from the accretion disk and the neutron star surface , the origin of the high - energy tail is less clear .    the radio emission in the x - ray binaries",
    "is suggested to originate from jet - like outflows which may also produce x - rays @xcite . in particular , there are indication that both black - hole candidate and neutron stars sytems , when in hard state , produce steady jet ( migliari & fender 2006 ) . also , in the hard state , positive correlation between radio and x - ray fluxes has been reported ( migliari & fender 2006 ) .",
    "4u 182030  is one of the few radio detected atoll source .",
    "the only radio emission reported so far was during the soft state @xcite , but it is probable that radio emission exist also in the hard state , as e.g. for 4u 1728 - 34 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the power - law tail detected by us is relatively soft , with @xmath25 , and dominates over the comptonization emission already for @xmath56 kev , as shown in fig .",
    "[ plotfour ] .",
    "integration to its minimum energy , @xmath57 , yields the luminosity in this component @xmath58 .",
    "if this component is due to nonthermal synchrotron emission , @xmath57 corresponds to the self - absorption turnover , typically in the ir or optical range , as it is the case in another ultracompact binary , 4u 0614 + 091 ( migliari et al .",
    "then the tail luminosity would be @xmath1110 times that of x - rays ( see also discussion in zdziarski et al .",
    "2003 ) , making the island state more luminous than the banana state , with the maximum of the overall @xmath59 at @xmath111 ev , neither of those seen in x - ray binaries .      a more likely origin of the power law tail appears to be emission of nonthermal electrons in a hybrid ( i.e. , containing also thermal electrons ) plasma , as discussed in section [ spectral ] .",
    "nonthermal tails have been commonly seen in soft states of black - hole binaries ( e.g. , cyg x-1 , gierliski et al .",
    "1999 ) and neutron - star z - sources , e.g. , gx  17 + 2 ( di salvo et al .",
    "2000 ; farinelli et al .",
    "2005 ) , sco  x-1 @xcite , gx  349 + 2 @xcite , gx  51 @xcite , while they are difficult to detect in the atoll sources , e.g. , 4u 0614 + 091 @xcite . on the other hand , nonthermal tails have been found in the hard state of some black - hole binaries , e.g. cyg x-1 ( mcconnell et al .",
    "2002 ) and gx 3394 ( wardziski et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the 4u 182030  high - energy part of the spectrum ( e @xmath60 kev ) can be well fitted with purely thermal comptonization at @xmath61 kev , as discussed in section [ spectral ] .",
    "this electron temperature is higher than that seen in 4u 160852 ( gierliski & done 2002 ) , but the comptonization temperature of atolls in the island state has not yet been determined for a sample of sources , and @xmath61 kev is similar to that seen in the hard state of black - hole binaries ( e.g. , zdziarski & gierliski 2004 ) .",
    "then , the problem with fitting the spectrum at @xmath62 kev with this model may be due to the complexity of the x - ray spectra in the hard state , including contributions from the disk , the corona above the disk , optically - thin and optically - thick parts of the boundary layer and the uncovered part of the neutron star surface .    a different thermal comptonization model has been considered by markoff et al .",
    "they proposed thermal synchrotron self - compton emission in a jet as a model for the hard state of black hole binaries .",
    "however , their model requires an extremely high electron temperature , @xmath634 mev .",
    "this would result in the thermal spectral cutoff in black hole binaries at energies @xmath64 mev , which has not been seen in _ any _ object yet .",
    "although we can not formally rule out a contribution from this process , postulating the presence of @xmath113 mev plasma in 4u 182030 appears rather speculative at this time .    in summary",
    ", we have discovered strong high - energy emission from 4u 182030 .",
    "the high energy emission is harder than that from some other atolls in the island state .",
    "its most likely interpretation is either emission of some nonthermal electrons or thermal emission from plasmas with a relatively high temperature , @xmath65 kev .",
