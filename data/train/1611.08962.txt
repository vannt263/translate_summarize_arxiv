    "apart from fundamental interest this also has practical applications in witnessing various physical properties .",
    "we briefly describe how the unextendible sets help in witnessing the degree of purity of a state .",
    "a set of mubs is called _ strongly unextendible _ if there is not even a single vector unbiased to all the vectors in the set . in this case",
    "there is not a single pure quantum state that gives rise to completely random results when measured with the observables from the unextendible set . in other words ,",
    "the entropy of the measurement results summed over the observables has an upper bound @xmath15 .",
    "hence , observing larger entropy than @xmath16 indicates that a mixed state is being measured .",
    "all our examples in table  [ tab_summary ] , except for @xmath17 , form strongly unextendible mubs . note that any _ pair _ of mubs can never be strongly unextendible since for any two bases of a @xmath2-dimensional hilbert space there exist at least @xmath18 vectors unbiased to both @xcite .",
    "we would also like to note that the existence of unextendible mubs provides information on the complex topology of the `` bloch '' space of quantum states of higher - dimensional quantum systems .",
    "a density matrix describing a pure state of a @xmath2-level quantum system can be written in the operator basis of generalised pauli matrices @xcite . in this",
    "`` bloch '' representation a pure quantum state is mapped to a normalised vector with @xmath19 real coefficients .",
    "it turns out that the resulting set of states is rather complex for dimensions @xmath20 , and unextendible mubs provide a hint for why this is the case .",
    "while mutually unbiased states are mapped to orthogonal bloch vectors , orthogonal quantum states are mapped to non - orthogonal bloch vectors with an angle @xmath21 between them .",
    "a basis in the hilbert space translates to a regular ( @xmath22)-dimensional simplex in the bloch space @xcite .",
    "thus the nonexistence of a vector that is unbiased to a set of mubs means that there is not a single unit bloch vector of a physical pure quantum state in the orthogonal complement to the space spanned by the bloch vectors of unextendible mubs .",
    "these orthogonal complements are of high dimensionality given by @xmath23 , where @xmath7 is the number of bases in the unextendible set . for example , in the bloch space of a four - level system , there exists a @xmath14-dimensional subspace ( out of @xmath24 dimensions in total ) with no unit bloch vector representing a physical pure state .",
    "the paper is organised around table  [ tab_summary ] . in section  [ sec_small ]",
    "we gather previous results from which one can infer the size of the minimal set of complementary observables up to dimension @xmath14 ( including @xmath14 ) .",
    "the new results in the table are obtained by different methods which are described in subsequent sections .",
    "we first arrive at various candidate unextendible sets and next show that they are indeed unextendible by computer - aided algebraic methods .",
    "finally , we discuss various approaches to unextendibility and use them to prove the existence of unextendible sets in many new dimensions .",
    "let us begin by recalling the cardinalities of minimal sets of complementary observables in dimensions @xmath25 .",
    "if the standard basis is represented by the identity matrix , then the matrices representing all bases unbiased to it must have all entries of the same modulus .",
    "the results below follow from studies of these so - called complex hadamard matrices .",
    "note that two hadamard matrices are equivalent if one transforms into the other by multiplication with permutation and diagonal matrices , and two sets of mubs are equivalent if a unitary matrix maps one set to the other .    in dimension two we have no unextendible mubs .",
    "all @xmath26 hadamard matrices are equivalent to the fourier matrix @xmath27 , and only one triple of mubs exists .",
    "these three bases correspond to the eigenstates of the pauli operators @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , in dimension three no unextendible mubs exist .",
    "all hadamard matrices are equivalent to the fourier matrix @xmath31 , and six vectors are mutually unbiased to the pair @xmath32 .",
    "these six vectors can be partitioned into two bases .",
    "together with @xmath33 and @xmath31 they form a unique quadruple of mubs that contains two inequivalent triples of mubs .    the smallest case",
    "in which unextendible mubs appear is dimension four , where an infinite family of cardinality three exists . in this dimension",
    "all pairs of mubs are equivalent to a member of the one - parameter set @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the one - parameter fourier family of @xmath36 matrices .",
    "each of these pairs extends to a mutually unbiased triple @xmath37 , producing a three - parameter set  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath38 , then unique sets of four and five mubs exist ( note that a set of @xmath2 mubs in dimension @xmath2 is always extendible  @xcite ) , and other values of @xmath39 give rise to an unextendible set .",
    "a simple example of an unextendible triple of mubs is the following : @xmath40 @xmath41 with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and where the rows of each matrix represent the orthogonal vectors of each basis .",
    "in dimension five there are no unextendible mubs . according to  @xcite",
    "there is a unique choice of hadamard matrix , @xmath44 , and exactly @xmath45 vectors are mutually unbiased to the pair @xmath46 .",
    "these vectors can be partitioned into four orthonormal bases , resulting in unique combination of six mubs  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that our problem is also solved for dimension six : there is a pair of complementary measurements which do not extend to a triple  @xcite .",
    "this pair corresponds to the set @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the isolated hadamard matrix  @xcite .",
    "@xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "a complete classification of hadamard matrices in dimension six is unknown , but other minimal sets may exist .",
    "we begin with a lemma that holds in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "it will then be utilised in the construction of a particular triple of mubs that will be shown to be unextendible by computer - aided techniques .",
    "the lemma utilises the fourier basis , which is defined as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a @xmath2th root of unity , @xmath56 denotes the standard basis , and @xmath57 denotes the fourier matrix with elements @xmath58 , where the rows and columns are enumerated as @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath60 be a state that is unbiased with respect to the fourier basis .",
    "then the states @xmath61 form an orthonormal basis that is unbiased with respect to the fourier basis .",
    "[ lem_fourier ]    first we prove that the unbiasedness of the vector @xmath62 implies that all vectors @xmath63 are unbiased to the fourier basis .",
    "indeed , @xmath64 where the step in between the lines follows from @xmath65 , and the last step expresses our assumption about the unbiasedness of the vector @xmath62 .",
    "it remains to be shown that vectors @xmath66 form a basis . to this end",
    "let us first compute their inverse fourier transform : @xmath67 where we introduced @xmath68 .",
    "since the fourier transform preserves the inner products , it is sufficient to show that the transformed vectors form a basis : @xmath69 where , due to , we have used that @xmath70 for all values of @xmath71 .",
    "let us now restrict ourselves to prime dimensions @xmath4 which are equal to @xmath72 .",
    "[ lem_3m4 ] let @xmath4 be a prime with @xmath72 .",
    "then the states @xmath73 with @xmath74 form a mutually unbiased basis with respect to both the standard and the fourier basis .",
    "the sets @xmath75 and @xmath76 denote the quadratic residues ( including zero ) and non - residues modulo @xmath4 , respectively .    clearly , for all @xmath7 we have @xmath77 , i.e. , all vectors @xmath63 are mutually unbiased with respect to the standard basis .",
    "we now prove that @xmath62 is unbiased with respect to the fourier basis .",
    "consider @xmath78 for @xmath79 we find @xmath80 where we have used the fact that the number of elements in @xmath76 ( @xmath75 ) is equal to @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "this shows that indeed @xmath83 . in order to find the other coefficients",
    ", we first note that for @xmath84 : @xmath85 thus , for @xmath86 we have @xmath87 revealing that @xmath62 is unbiased to the fourier basis .",
    "the proof concludes by utilising lemma  [ lem_fourier ] .",
    "a concrete example of the basis introduced in lemma  [ lem_3m4 ] for dimension @xmath51 reads as follows : @xmath88 where @xmath89 . to see that the rows or columns correspond to orthogonal states",
    "note that @xmath90 .",
    "we have shown that the standard basis , the fourier basis , and the basis of lemma  [ lem_3m4 ] form a triple of mubs .",
    "we verified by computer - aided techniques that this triple is unextendible in dimensions @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "we conjecture that for any prime @xmath4 with @xmath72 , the triple obtained in this way is unextendible .",
    "note that in prime dimensions smaller than @xmath51 there are no unextendible sets of mubs and , furthermore , the only existing sets of mubs are maximal . from this perspective",
    "the existence of basis @xmath93 is unexpected .",
    "one can proceed along similar lines for other prime dimensions . this time",
    "the candidate basis is given by the following lemma .",
    "[ lem_gabidulin ] ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) let @xmath4 be a prime with @xmath96 .",
    "define @xmath97 then the states @xmath98 , where @xmath99 form a mutually unbiased basis with respect to both the standard and the fourier basis .",
    "since @xmath100 lies on the unit circle the vectors @xmath63 are clearly mutually unbiased to the standard basis .",
    "note also that @xmath101 , where @xmath102 denotes the complex conjugation of @xmath100 .",
    "now we prove that @xmath62 is unbiased with respect to the fourier basis .",
    "for @xmath103 we have @xmath104 where we have used the fact that the sets @xmath76 and @xmath105 each have @xmath81 elements , and @xmath106 . to find the remaining coefficients we will need the following two equations : @xmath107 which apply for @xmath84 , and @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath109 : @xmath110 and hence @xmath111 thus , the vector @xmath62 is unbiased to the fourier basis , and by application of lemma  [ lem_fourier ] we have completed the proof .",
    "again we have verified by computer - aided algebraic methods that this set is unextendible in dimension @xmath112 , and conjecture that it is unextendible in all prime dimensions @xmath96 . in this way we have now covered all prime dimensions .",
    "in a composite dimension @xmath113 ( with prime factors @xmath114 for @xmath115 ) most of our small sets of complementary observables follow from the results in ref .  @xcite .",
    "it is useful to introduce the weyl - heisenberg operators : @xmath116 it turns out that there always exists a set of @xmath117 complementary observables corresponding to the eigenbases of the operators @xmath118 that is `` weakly '' unextendible in the sense that it can not be extended by another basis which is an eigenbasis of any other weyl - heisenberg operator .",
    "they are therefore natural candidates for truly unextendible bases .",
    "indeed , we verified for all even composite dimensions presented in table  [ tab_summary ] , the three eigenbases of @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 are strongly unextendible .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to conjecture in general that the complementary observables form an unextendible set .    in dimensions",
    "@xmath122 and @xmath24 the bound of eq .",
    "gives four bases , but we found unextendible sets with only three measurements .",
    "these sets include the standard basis , its fourier transform , and a third basis . however , as it is difficult to recognise the structure of the third bases , we will not report them here explicitly .",
    "one can generalise the notion of mutually unbiased bases to an infinite dimensional hilbert space by defining two bases @xmath123 and @xmath124 as mutually unbiased if @xmath125 , for all vectors @xmath126 and @xmath127 , with @xmath128 a positive constant . here",
    "we also assume that both bases satisfy the orthonormality condition in terms of dirac delta , i.e. @xmath129 and @xmath130 .    for an example , consider the hilbert space @xmath131 and the generalised eigenstates @xmath132 of the operator @xmath133 , where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the position and momentum operators , respectively .",
    "the overlap of @xmath132 with @xmath136 can be calculated from the wigner functions of the quantum states and is given by  @xcite : @xmath137 since the overlap depends only on the angles @xmath138 and @xmath139 , the bases @xmath140 and @xmath141 are mutually unbiased . by fixing the first basis to be @xmath142 , with @xmath143 , one can find a symmetric triple of mubs @xcite : @xmath142 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 , where @xmath146 .",
    "it is straightforward to see from the wigner functions that multiplying the operator @xmath147 by @xmath148 results in the overlap @xmath149 it is always possible to extend any pair of mubs to a triple of mubs .    if we consider mubs from the eigenstates of observables @xmath150 , then no unextendible pair of mubs exists , and all triples are unextendible .",
    "we rotate the coordinate system and set the unit of length such that for the first operator we have @xmath151 and @xmath152 . with this choice",
    ", we now show that mubs corresponding to the operators @xmath153 and @xmath154 always extend to a third mub for all @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 .",
    "we consider a third operator @xmath158 and show that the mutual unbiasedness equations @xmath159 are satisfied for a particular choice of @xmath160 and @xmath161 . choosing @xmath162 , the first equality is satisfied for all @xmath138 , @xmath163 , and @xmath148 .",
    "the final condition becomes @xmath164 , which is satisfied when @xmath165 hence , the operators @xmath166 with @xmath167 and @xmath168 in eq .",
    "correspond to two sets of three mubs , each with two parameters . if we consider a fourth basis corresponding to the operator @xmath169 , it is easy to check that there is no mutually unbiased set of four bases .",
    "for example , choosing @xmath152 and @xmath170 we arrive at two triples , the symmetric mutually unbiased triple @xmath171 , and @xmath172 .",
    "choosing @xmath152 and @xmath173 we find the asymmetric triples @xmath174  @xcite .",
    "here we discuss two approaches which reveal that unextendible mubs are present in infinitely many dimensions .",
    "related result can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , but our analysis extends to other dimensions .      both of our approaches utilise a result which limits the number of _ real _ bases in a complete set of mubs  @xcite . in particular , given a complete set of mubs in dimension @xmath2 , written in the form @xmath175 , where @xmath33 is the identity matrix and @xmath176 are complex hadamard matrices of order @xmath2 , then at most one of the hadamard matrices @xmath176 can be real .",
    "therefore , any set of complementary observables represented by the identity and at least two real hadamard matrices is part of an unextendible set .    in dimensions @xmath177 , constructions given in refs .",
    "@xcite find @xmath178 real mubs ( in some of these dimensions ref .",
    "@xcite finds a smaller number of real mubs but still larger than @xmath179 ) .",
    "these bases can be transformed into a set of @xmath180 real hadamard matrices , which therefore belong to an unextendible set of mubs .",
    "while no additional real basis is mutually unbiased to this set , @xmath181 gives only a lower bound on the cardinality of the unextendible set .",
    "other complex hadamard matrices may exist which represent additional mubs with respect to the whole set .",
    "a better lower bound is achieved , and for a larger set of dimensions , by starting with mutually orthogonal latin squares ( mols )",
    "@xcite describes a procedure using hadamard matrices and mols , which transforms a set of @xmath7 squares of order @xmath2 to a set of @xmath182 mubs in dimension @xmath183 .",
    "bachelor latin squares are squares which have no orthogonal mate ( i.e. , an unextendible set of mols with @xmath184 ) , and have recently been shown to exist for all @xmath185  @xcite .",
    "we therefore use the construction of  @xcite with a bachelor latin square and a real hadamard matrix of order @xmath2 .",
    "the hadamard conjecture suggests that such a matrix always exists for all @xmath186 and according to most recent checks , the first case in which a real hadamard matrix has not yet been found is @xmath187  @xcite . with these ingredients the procedure yields three real mubs @xmath188 . to transform this set to the standard form",
    ", we multiply each matrix with the transposed matrix @xmath189 , i.e. @xmath190 . the matrices @xmath191 and @xmath192 are now two real hadamard matrices , and the triple of mubs does not extend to a complete set . unfortunately , this lower bound is not tight . we have verified in dimension @xmath193 that the three mubs obtained in this way can be extended to at least five bases .    finally , we utilise the concept of unextendibility to comment briefly on any conjectured strong relationship between mols and mubs .",
    "it has been observed that certain complete sets of mols translate into complete sets of mubs in prime and prime - power dimensions via an algorithm given in ref .",
    "similarly , in a reverse process , one can construct complete sets of mols from certain complete sets of mubs  @xcite .",
    "it might therefore be tempting to conjecture a strong statement that to every set of mols there corresponds a set of mubs . for the algorithm given in ref .",
    "@xcite this is disproved in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we note that such a conjecture can not be true for any algorithm directly linking sets of mols and mub , and preserving ( un)extendibility .",
    "this follows from the observation that a bachelor latin square should correspond to a set of three unextendible mubs in any dimension @xmath194 .",
    "however , this is not the case for dimension five where no unextendible set of mubs exists ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec_small ] ) .",
    "we finish by noting that the weaker statement given in ref .",
    "@xcite , that a maximal set of mubs exists in those dimensions @xmath2 for which one can find a maximal set of mols of order @xmath2 , might still hold true .",
    "we presented small and unextendible sets of complementary observables , usually containing three measurements .",
    "it is of course interesting to ask if even smaller sets exist with the ultimate limit of two .",
    "mathematically these would correspond to so - called bachelor hadamard matrices , which so far are only known to exist in dimension six .",
    "we therefore hope our study will motivate the search for bachelor hadamards in other dimensions as well as the search for further applications of unextendible mubs .",
