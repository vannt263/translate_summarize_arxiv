    "thermal instability often appears in astrophysical media which are undergoing a global process of cooling , expansion or contraction .",
    "a non - exhaustive list of examples includes : thermal instability in a cooling flow in a galaxy cluster @xcite , in a stellar wind @xcite , or in the hot ism @xcite , and structure formation in a collapsing protogalaxy @xcite . in all those cases ,",
    "the unperturbed state is not one of thermal or dynamical equilibrium , so that the stability and the time evolution of the perturbations can not be studied by means of a classical normal  mode fourier analysis in time .",
    "the situation is complicated by other physical processes which can be important for the unperturbed state or for the perturbation itself , like self - gravity , thermal conduction , and magnetic induction and diffusion .",
    "the stability criteria and the evolution of the perturbations directly depend on the relative time - scale of the latter processes with respect to each other and to the time - scales of cooling and expansion of the background in which they are developing .",
    "the astrophysical literature abounds in examples of thermal stability analyses and their application to specific problems , as in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a milestone was the paper by @xcite .",
    "he considered a non - expanding homogeneous medium in thermal equilibrium ( i.e. , with cooling exactly compensating heating ) , including thermal conduction and magnetic fields .",
    "the small  perturbation problem is then amenable to a normal - mode fourier analysis in space and time . additionally to magnetosonic waves , which can be strongly modified by the thermal processes , he found a non - oscillatory mode ( called condensation mode ) which may have an isobaric or isochoric character depending on the amount of cooling or conduction possible during one crossing time of a magnetosonic wave across the perturbation .",
    "conduction becomes important at small spatial scales and , in general , has a strongly stabilizing effect .",
    "another important step forward was taken by @xcite and @xcite , who considered a time ",
    "dependent unperturbed medium . by using the entropy equation",
    ", they obtained stability criteria for the condensation mode in a medium with global cooling , not taking into account conduction , self - gravity or any background stratification .",
    "@xcite , in particular , carried out a wkb analysis in space for radial perturbations in an expanding or contracting medium with spherical symmetry .",
    "@xcite relaxed the condition of homogeneous background and obtained solutions for a stratified medium . @xcite also included a background magnetic field .",
    "the topic of thermal instability in astrophysical media seems to have been gathering momentum in the past several years . in spite of the foregoing",
    ", there is to date no _ systematic _ study of the stability of a magnetized medium subject to cooling , self - gravity and thermal conduction when the unperturbed state itself is undergoing expansion and cooling .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to carry out such a study using , wherever possible , a wkb expansion _ in time_. the treatment introduced here permits recovering many results of the previous literature in a unified manner and allows obtaining new ones . the non - magnetic and non - stratified case is considered in the present paper , which deals with the problem of a uniform ( but time - dependent ) background .",
    "however , the results of this paper can also be applied locally to a weakly non - homogeneous background ( see sect . [ swkb ] ) .",
    "several characteristic time - scales have to be considered , to wit , those associated with the background expansion , self - gravity , cooling , sound - wave propagation and conduction .",
    "when background cooling and expansion are _ not _ the fastest processes in the system , a wkb analysis in time can be carried out .",
    "general wkb solutions up to arbitrary order are then obtained and applied to the particular cases when the fastest time - scales are those associated with sound wave propagation , with sound and self - gravity simultaneously , or with conduction .",
    "new results obtained in the present paper are as follows .",
    "first , we obtain an expression for the critical length separating stable from unstable domains which generalizes the classical _ field length _ to a system which , in the unperturbed state , is cooling ( or otherwise ) and expanding or contracting globally .",
    "@xcite showed the opposite effects of conduction and cooling on the stability of a system in static and thermal equilibrium in the case when the cooling function , @xmath1 , fulfills @xmath2_p < 0 $ ] , and found that below a critical wavelength ( the classical _ field length _ )",
    "conduction stabilizes the system .",
    "our study permits relaxing the condition of thermal equilibrium in the unperturbed state and including in the latter a global expansion or contraction .",
    "we may note that , for lack of a more accurate expression , different authors in the past have tentatively used the value calculated by field even though their problem involved a medium undergoing global cooling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in section [ s_astr ]",
    ", we calculate the generalized field length for a medium undergoing a realistic net cooling , and compare it with the classical field length of a medium in thermal equilibrium with the same cooling but with a balancing constant heating .",
    "the results of the present paper also generalize those of @xcite , who considered a medium undergoing global cooling in the unperturbed state , but ignored thermal conduction .",
    "second , there is in the literature no simultaneous study of the thermal and gravitational linear stability of a medium undergoing net cooling .",
    "the combination of both phenomena is important , for example , for the structure formation in a protogalaxy @xcite , where condensations previously formed by thermal instability in a cooling medium become gravitationally unstable . in section [ s_sougr ]",
    "we calculate how the acoustic - gravity modes of @xcite are modified through conduction and cooling when the background itself is cooling globally .",
    "we also show the existence of a hitherto unknown condensation mode in this case . in all these solutions",
    "the perturbations can go through different stability regimes : in a cooling medium the generalized field length and the jeans length change with time whereas the wavelength of the perturbation remains constant .",
    "there is an alternative to a wkb expansion when trying to solve the problem tackled in this paper . @xcite",
    "have used a taylor expansion in time for the reduced problem when there is no thermal conduction , self - gravity or background expansion . yet , a taylor expansion has the large disadvantage of being valid only at times small compared with the characteristic times of evolution of the background .",
    "this is in contrast to the wkb approach taken in the present paper , which is valid for arbitrary times as long as the perturbation does not grow beyond the linear regime .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in section [ s_pose_problem ] , the equations of the problem are presented and the relevant time - scales introduced both for the background and the perturbations .",
    "section [ swkb ] contains a discussion of the application of the wkb method to the present problem and provides a general wkb solution to the linear perturbation equations . in section [ sec_intermediate",
    "] , a collection of solutions for intermediate wavelengths is presented .",
    "the word _ intermediate _ is used in the sense that the wavelength is not small nor large enough for conduction or cooling , respectively , to be the dominant processes in the evolution .",
    "the case in which sound propagation is the fastest process is considered in section [ ssou ] whereas in section [ s_sougr ] both self - gravity and sound are the fastest processes .",
    "section [ sother ] is devoted to the large and small wavelength regimes and , in particular , to the cases when cooling or conduction operate on the fastest time - scale . in section [ s_astr ] , the generalized field length and the instability domain",
    "are computed for an optically thin medium at high temperature threaded by a magnetic field without dynamical effects ( e.g. , the hot ism ) .",
    "the final section ( sect .  [ ssum ] ) contains a summary and further discussion of the results of the paper .",
    "this section discusses the physical processes relevant for the present problem , the governing system of equations , and the method used to solve this system .",
    "the equations are given first in general ( sec .",
    "[ sequ ] ) and then specialized for the homogeneous unperturbed medium ( sec .",
    "[ sback ] ) and for small perturbations to that medium ( sec .",
    "[ slinear ] ) .",
    "there is a considerable number of different physical processes of importance for the present problem : the corresponding time - scales are listed and explained in section [ stimes ] .",
    "a general wkb solution to the linear perturbation system is obtained and discussed in section [ swkb ] .",
    "we consider an optically thin polytropic ideal gas .",
    "the fluid equations that describe the evolution of the system including thermal conduction and self - gravity are :    @xmath3    @xmath4    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the lagrangian time derivative , @xmath7 is the polytropic index of the ideal gas , @xmath8 is the mean atomic mass per particle , @xmath9 is the universal gas constant , @xmath10 ( erg s@xmath11 gr@xmath11 ) is the net cooling function ( including heating ) , @xmath12 is the thermal conduction coefficient and @xmath13 is the gravitational potential caused by the mass distribution of the system @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the universal constant of gravitation .",
    "all other symbols have their usual meaning in hydrodynamics . equations ( [ eq_cont ] ) , ( [ eq_mom ] ) and ( [ eq_ener ] ) are the continuity , momentum and energy equations , respectively .",
    "the temperature is related to the other quantities by the ideal gas equation : @xmath16 .",
    "the change of @xmath8 due to recombination or ionization processes is not considered in this paper .",
    "this is fully acceptable for high enough temperature ( @xmath17k ) , in which the medium is almost completely ionized , or in situations at lower temperature when the change in @xmath8 is less important than the contribution of cooling and conduction .",
    "the thermal instability of a medium in thermal equilibrium with variable @xmath8 has been considered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , note that the radiative flux in the diffusion limit ( optically thick medium ) is identical to the classical thermal conduction flux except for the associated conductivity coefficient ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , our treatment also allows for the use of radiative transport in the diffusion limit .      as a basis for the small  perturbation analysis",
    ", we assume a homogeneous background which is expanding uniformly and cooling ( or heating ) by radiation , so that the unperturbed quantities only depend on time .",
    "the background quantities will be denoted with the subscript @xmath18 .",
    "the expansion is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the eulerian coordinate , @xmath21 is the lagrangian coordinate and @xmath22 is the expansion parameter . using equation ( [ eq_expan ] ) ,",
    "the unperturbed velocity field is given by @xmath23 where the dot over a symbol ( as in @xmath24 ) indicates its time derivative .",
    "equations ( [ eq_cont ] ) and ( [ eq_ener ] ) reduce for the background to @xmath25 respectively , where @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath22 must be specified from equation  ( [ eq_mom ] ) .",
    "the latter yields @xmath27 when self - gravity is negligible and @xmath28 otherwise .",
    "additionally , more general forms for @xmath22 are allowed for the local application of the perturbative analysis around a lagrangian fluid element in a non - uniform background , as will be explained at the end of section [ swkb ] .      to obtain a linearized system of equations for the perturbations we proceed as follows",
    "first , we split each variable into unperturbed and perturbed components , indicating the latter with a subscript @xmath29 , like , e.g. @xmath30 and similarly for pressure and temperature .",
    "eulerian linear perturbations are then taken in equations ( [ eq_cont ] ) through ( [ eq_ener ] ) .",
    "thereafter , the eulerian divergence operator is applied to the momentum equation and all equations are rewritten in terms of the lagrangian coordinate @xmath21 defined in equation ( [ eq_expan ] ) .",
    "the resulting linear system has coefficients which depend on @xmath31 but not on @xmath21 .",
    "we then carry out a spatial fourier analysis , with fourier components proportional to @xmath32 , so that @xmath33 is the lagrangian wave vector : @xmath34 and expressions similar to ( [ eq_densfourier ] ) for all other scalar variables ( pressure , temperature , etc ) . for simplicity , we eliminate the index @xmath33 from the fourier amplitudes in the following .",
    "the perturbed velocity is then split into its components parallel and normal to @xmath33 : @xmath35 finally , the resulting linear system is simplified by repeated use of the background equations and elementary thermodynamic relations .",
    "we obtain : @xmath36 with all coefficients of the perturbations being evaluated for the background values . as a result of the linearization , the time derivative @xmath37 in equations ( [ eq_rho1 ] ) through ( [ eq_p1 ] )",
    "is now given by @xmath38 , i.e. , it is the material derivative _ as one moves with the unperturbed fluid_. the other symbols have the following value : @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41_\\rho \\qquad \\hbox{and}\\qquad { \\omega_{cp}}= ( \\gamma-1)\\frac{\\mu}{{{\\cal r } } } t_0 \\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t } \\left(\\frac{{\\mathcal{l}}}{t}\\right ) \\right]_p \\;,\\qquad   \\ ] ] where @xmath42    are , respectively , the adiabatic background sound speed and the eulerian wavenumber . the coefficients ( [ eq_coe2])([eq_coe4 ] ) provide characteristic times for our problem : their meaning and relevance will be discussed in the next section .",
    "one also obtains an independent equation for the perpendicular component of the velocity , viz . :",
    "@xmath43 i.e. , the integral of the perturbed velocity along a closed material curve remains constant in time .",
    "the system ( [ eq_rho1])([eq_p1 ] ) is a linear ode system in @xmath31 for the vector of unknowns @xmath44 . considering the ratio perturbation / background is the natural choice because the unperturbed quantities depend on time .",
    "_ we will say that there is instability if either @xmath45 or @xmath46 grow with time .",
    "_ the velocity perturbation @xmath47 is not compared with any unperturbed quantity because there is no single unperturbed velocity which could serve as reference at all length scales : at scales smaller than the jeans length , the sound velocity should be used whereas one should choose @xmath48 for larger scales .",
    "a fundamental timescale in the problem is _ the period of a sound wave _ , @xmath49 , with @xmath50 defined in equation ( [ eq_coe2 ] ) .",
    "other important timescales are as follows :      \\(a ) _ the characteristic time of background expansion _ is : @xmath51 this time is also the time - scale for the adiabatic temperature decrease which follows from the expansion ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq_ener0 ] ] ) and for the inertial change of the perturbed velocity associated with the background expansion ( first term on the right - hand side of eq .  [ [ eq_v1 ] ] ) .",
    "\\(b ) the characteristic _ growth time of a perturbation by self - gravity _ , @xmath52 , is @xmath53 which coincides with @xmath54 , as defined in equation ( [ eq_coe2 ] ) . from equation ( [ eq_mom0 ] ) , @xmath52 is also the _",
    "timescale for the deceleration of the background expansion_.",
    "\\(c ) the characteristic _ timescale of background cooling _ because of radiation , @xmath55 , is given by ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq_ener0 ] ] ) @xmath56    for the growth ( or otherwise ) of the perturbations , one has to consider not only the cooling function itself at a given value of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , but also the _ differential cooling _ at neighboring values of temperature and density .",
    "the precise expression of this fact is obtained through the perturbed energy equation ( eq .  [ [ eq_p1 ] ] ) rewritten in the form : @xmath59    with _ the growth rate due to differential cooling _ , @xmath60 , defined as @xmath61 \\;.\\ ] ] in the simple case when the perturbation is carried out keeping pressure , density or entropy constant , @xmath62 in equation ( [ eq_omgc ] ) only depends on the background variables .",
    "then , @xmath63 and @xmath55 are the _ characteristic timescales of cooling_.    \\(d ) from equation ( [ eq_t1 ] ) , _ the timescale of thermal conduction _ is @xmath64 , which was defined in equation ( [ eq_coe3 ] ) .",
    "the different characteristic times have different dependences on @xmath65 , so the corresponding processes will become important in different wavelength domains .",
    "for instance , the conduction growth - rate , @xmath66 , depends on @xmath65 as @xmath67 .",
    "hence , conduction dominates at short wavelengths .",
    "the cooling , background expansion and self - gravity time - scales have no spatial dependence .",
    "hence , these processes are dominant at long wavelengths .",
    "the frequency of sound , finally , depends on the first power of @xmath65 .",
    "hence sound propagation could be the dominant effect at intermediate wavelengths .",
    "the boundaries between the different regions can be easily estimated using the definitions of the characteristic times just given .      to find the time evolution of the perturbations , the linear ode system ( [ eq_rho1])-([eq_p1 ] ) has to be solved .",
    "unfortunately , no simple analytical solution can be found in a general case .",
    "the only exception is when all coefficients are time - independent : then , a fourier analysis in time can be carried out and the system reduces to an algebraic eigenvalue problem , from which the normal modes of the problem can be obtained .",
    "this method was used in many of the early papers on thermal instability , like @xcite .",
    "if the background is expanding , or is undergoing net cooling , though , the coefficients are time - dependent and the system must be solved numerically in general .",
    "however , a general statement about the stability of the physical system can only be given via analytical solutions , even if they are only approximations to the actual solutions . in the following ,",
    "we study the wkb solutions to the problem .    to carry out the wkb analysis , we first transform the system ( [ eq_rho1])-([eq_p1 ] ) into a third order linear ode for @xmath68 .",

    "in addition , for wkb to be applicable , the time - scales of evolution of the background ( net cooling , expansion ) must be in the non - dominant group .",
    "call @xmath71 the shortest of the characteristic times associated with the dominant processes and @xmath72 the shortest of the characteristic times associated with the non - dominant processes , with @xmath73 .",

    "the growth rate of @xmath68 is thus given by the term in brackets within the integrand .",

    "equation ( [ eq_omen ] ) gives @xmath87 as a function of the previous orders @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the equation for the zero - order solution , in particular , is as follows : @xmath92 in the special case that propagation of sound , conduction , and differential cooling are the dominant processes , equation ( [ eq_ome3_text ] ) reduces to the dispersion relation of @xcite .",
    "a few properties of the wkb solution are as follows :    \\(1 ) the asymptotic series ( [ eq_wkb ] ) is convergent if latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq_condit }    these conditions are satisfied if @xmath73 as can be inferred from the relation @xmath94 $ ] , where @xmath95 indicates the order of magnitude in power of @xmath96 .",
    "this relation has been obtained using equation ( [ eq_omen ] ) and the equations for the background evolution .",
    "however , the first terms of this series can sometimes give an accurate approximation to the exact solution even when @xmath71 and @xmath72 are of the same order with @xmath97 .",
    "\\(2 ) the wkb expansion is a global perturbation method , that is , the wkb solution up to a certain order is good for all times , not just for times much smaller than the smallest background characteristic time ( as would be the case for a taylor expansion ) .",
    "\\(3 ) we have assumed a uniform background . in spite of this , the criteria we are going to obtain are applicable locally in a non - uniform background for a lagrangian fluid element if @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the perturbation wavelength and @xmath100 is the macroscopic variation length of the unperturbed quantities .",
    "that is , the effect of the non - uniform background is less important than the effect of the non - dominant processes if condition ( [ eq_aplibackuni ] ) holds .",
    "an additional condition to apply the stability criteria in a non - uniform background is : the local uniform expansion for the lagrangian fluid element @xmath101 should be much larger than the components of the pure deformation tensor and the curl of the unperturbed velocity .    in the following sections , we consider various possible cases of dominant and non - dominant processes ( see table [ tabl_cases ] ) . in section [ sec_intermediate ] , intermediate scales , for which sound is one of the dominant processes , are considered . in section [ sother ] , extreme scales , for which sound is a non - dominant process ,",

    "at intermediate wavelengths , the propagation of sound can be the dominant process , either alone or at the same level as one of the other physical processes . in the first subsection ( sec .",

    "the reason for the appearance in equation ( [ eq_sdc1 ] ) of the partial derivative of @xmath119 _ at constant pressure _ is that pressure remains almost spatially uniform in the condensation mode .",
    "indeed , the solution for pressure and velocity is : @xmath120 where @xmath95 indicates the order of magnitude in power of @xmath96 , with @xmath121 in this case given by the shortest of the conduction and cooling times appearing in equation ( [ eq_sdc1 ] ) .",
    "hence , the relative pressure perturbation obtained from the linear system is zero down to second wkb order .",
    "the second order wkb correction for the growth rate of @xmath68 for the condensation mode is equal to zero as can be shown using equation ( [ eq_omen ] ) for @xmath122 : the following non - zero correction appears at third wkb order .",

    "since @xmath125 has no real part , the change in amplitude is given by @xmath126 . from equation ( [ eq_sds1 ] ) we see that a net background radiative cooling ( @xmath127 ) has a destabilizing effect .",
    "expansion tends to destabilize these modes if @xmath128 .",
    "conduction has an unconditionally stabilizing effect for the sound mode .",
    "in contrast to the condensation mode ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq_sdc1 ] ] ) , now the @xmath129-derivative of @xmath1 that appears in the growth rate is _ at constant entropy_. this is easily understandable , since entropy is changed by conduction and cooling only , which are non - dominant processes in the present case .",
    "so , these modes evolve essentially at constant entropy .",
    "self - gravity does not appear in this first order correction ( assuming that all the non - dominant processes have a characteristic time of the same order ) .",

    "the solutions of the previous subsections generalize those obtained by previous authors for particular cases .",

    "this allows a large simplification in the presentation of the results in the following .    *",
    "( a ) critical wavelengths . *",
    "the critical wavelength for the condensation mode ( i.e. , the generalized field length ) is obtained from equation ( [ eq_kcrc ] ) , whereas for the sound waves it can be calculated by setting the growth rate ( [ eq_sds1 ] ) equal to zero .",
    "both are represented in figure [ fig_3_1a ] as implicit functions of @xmath152 and @xmath57 .",
    "the critical wavelength for the condensation mode ( solid line ) , is smaller than the critical wavelength for the sound waves ( dashed line ) .",
    "figure [ fig_3_1a ] also shows the region ( drawn as a shaded band ) where @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "the _ sound domain _ is contained within that band , but , as seen just below , the wkb solutions of the previous subsections are good approximations also close to the boundaries of the region . well above the shaded band , cooling acts on the fastest timescale ; well below it , conduction is dominant .    *",
    "( b ) comparison of wkb- and exact solutions .",
    "* we consider both the condensation mode and the sound waves for a case defined by @xmath155@xmath156 and @xmath157k at @xmath148 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_3_1b ] ) . with this choice ,",
    "both modes have initially a wavelength below the critical value .",
    "figures [ fig_3_1b]a and b show the time evolution of the background temperature and of @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "the other four panels in the figure compare the wkb solution with the numerical solution of the linear system ( [ eq_rho1])-([eq_p1 ] ) for an initial amplitude of the perturbation @xmath160 .",
    "panels ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) show the time evolution of the condensation mode ( solid : wkb approximation ; dashed : numerical solution ) and the relative error between them ( dotted line ) .",
    "the wkb solution turns out to be an excellent approximation to the exact solution : both curves are almost indistinguishable except when @xmath161 .",
    "in fact , the relative error of the wkb solution for @xmath68 is still below @xmath162 when @xmath158 reaches the value @xmath163 .",
    "initially , the condensation mode has a wavelength below the critical value , but the latter decreases as the system cools ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_3_1a ] ) and their ratio grows above unity for @xmath164 .",
    "therefore , @xmath68 first decreases , then reaches a minimum at that time , and grows thereafter .",
    "figure [ fig_3_1b]f shows the wkb and numerical solutions for the sound wave .",
    "again , the agreement between both solutions is excellent .",
    "the wavelength ratio follows a similar evolution as for the condensation mode , and so does the perturbation amplitude .",
    "going to spatial scales larger than in the foregoing section , there is interesting new physics when the wavelength approaches the jeans length , @xmath165 , that is , as soon as @xmath166 is no longer small compared to @xmath50 . in this subsection",
    "we study the regime in which either sound or gravity ( or both simultaneously ) are dominant and the background is slowly cooling or heating but with zero expansion rate ( if @xmath167 , the expansion would become as dominant as self - gravity itself after a time of order @xmath52 at the latest , see eq .  [ [ eq_mom0 ] ] , and the wkb model could not be used ) .",
    "consider , then , the case in which @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath66 are all much smaller than both @xmath50 and @xmath166 .",
    "there are then three wkb solutions : two acoustic  gravity modes and a condensation mode .",
    "we use the symbols @xmath170 and @xmath171 for their respective growth rates for @xmath68 . as in the previous case ,",
    "the zero - order solutions are obtained by calculating the three roots of the polynomial ( [ eq_ome3_text ] ) , but now the coefficients @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 have the values given in appendix [ ape ] , expressions ( [ coesgd1 ] ) . the result is : @xmath172 to zero order , therefore , we have a couple of acoustic  gravity modes ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq_sgds0 ] ] ) like those obtained by @xcite and a non - evolving mode ( eq .  [ [ eq_sgdc0 ] ] ) .",
    "the latter corresponds to any perturbation with @xmath110 and @xmath173 , i.e. , equilibrium between pressure gradient and self - gravity .",

    "in particular , the perturbation collapses gravitationally and the pressure gradient is not large enough to prevent it .",
    "the introduction of cooling and thermal conduction as non - dominant processes makes the amplitude of these modes change .",
    "these modifications are given by the wkb corrections of order one and greater .    to calculate the first order corrections for the growth rates of @xmath68 for those modes , namely @xmath176 and @xmath114",
    ", we turn again to the general wkb solution ( eq .  [ [ eq_omen ] ] ) , using @xmath115 and the coefficients given in expressions ( [ coesgd2 ] ) of appendix [ ape ] .",
    "we show and discuss them in the following :      the first order wkb correction for the condensation mode is given by @xmath177_p - \\gamma \\frac{\\omega_g^2}{\\omega_s^2 } \\left(\\frac{\\partial { \\mathcal{l}}}{\\partial t } \\right)_{\\rho } + \\frac{\\chi_0}{\\rho_0}\\frac{k^2}{a^2 } \\left ( 1 - \\gamma \\frac{\\omega_g^2}{\\omega_s^2 } \\right)\\right\\}\\left ( 1 - \\frac{\\omega_g^2}{\\omega_s^2 } \\right)^{-1}\\;.\\ ] ] this mode reduces to the sound domain condensation mode ( [ eq_sdc1 ] ) when @xmath178 .",
    "we introduce the quantity @xmath179 which is proportional to the perturbation of the net volume force ( pressure gradient minus self - gravity ) . using this quantity ,",
    "the relative perturbations can be written @xmath180 where @xmath121 is the inverse time - scale of the non - dominant processes ( conduction and cooling ) .",
    "this is similar to equation ( [ eq_relsizesound ] ) but now the sound - gravity modes , that propagate or grow much faster than the condensation mode , lead to the cancellation of the gravity force by the pressure gradient instead of to a condition of uniform pressure throughout .",
    "the first order correction ( [ eq_sgdc1 ] ) shows three interesting features .",
    "first , it diverges when @xmath181 , i.e. , there is a turning - point in the wkb sense .",
    "the turning point can easily be reached in a cooling and non - expanding medium for wavelengths for which , initially , @xmath182 : the former frequency decreases with time whereas the latter stays constant . as known from the wkb theory , when a solution goes through a turning point , a mixing of modes takes place .",
    "second , conduction has a destabilizing effect in the range @xmath183 .",
    "this can be explained using the equation of evolution for the perturbed entropy , @xmath184 , and the relation between @xmath184 and @xmath185 following the condition of permanent equilibrium between gravity and pressure gradient .",
    "third , the combination of partial derivatives of @xmath1 is quite different to the corresponding expression in equation ( [ eq_sdc1 ] ) . in the following we explain the origin of the last feature .    to explain the origin of the cooling terms in equation ( [ eq_sgdc1 ] ) we can use the results of @xcite . using lagrangian perturbations in the entropy equation , he derived an instability criterion for the condensation mode in the absence of conduction in the particular case in which the perturbation of an arbitrary thermodynamic variable @xmath186 is kept equal to zero during the evolution of the condensation mode .",
    "the resulting criterion is obtained from the following equation : @xmath187_a\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath188 indicates lagrangian perturbation .",
    "@xcite applies this equation to the cases @xmath189 and @xmath190 . in the present section , in turn ,",
    "the physical quantity whose perturbation remains equal to zero is @xmath191 ( eq .  [ [ mquan ] ] ) ; on the other hand , lagrangian and eulerian perturbations are indistinguishable since the background is uniform ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it can then be shown that the cooling terms in equation ( [ eq_sgdc1 ] ) can be derived from the right - hand side of equation ( [ entrlag ] ) , using the relationship between the growth rates of @xmath184 and @xmath68 .",
    "critical lengths are computed solving the equation @xmath192 .",
    "this equation can be expressed as : @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the critical wavelength , @xmath195 is @xmath196 evaluated for @xmath197 , and @xmath198 i.e. , minus the growth rate due to isochoric cooling in the classical theory of @xcite . at the jeans length ,",
    "it is natural to expect cooling to be much faster than conduction ( @xmath199 ) . assuming this , the solutions of equation ( [ eq_critcondag ] ) are given by : @xmath200 for the existence of a critical length",
    ", the right - hand side of the corresponding expression must be positive .",
    "the first critical length coincides with that of equation ( [ eq_kcrc ] ) , which corresponds to a condensation mode in the sound dominated case .",
    "the second critical length is new , and has a value that is near @xmath201 .",
    "if both critical lengths exist and @xmath202 , the condensation mode will be unstable for wavelengths @xmath99 such that @xmath203 .",
    "the first order wkb correction for the acoustic ",
    "gravity modes is @xmath204 -\\left(\\frac{3}{2}-\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\right ) \\frac{{\\mathcal{l}}_0}{t_0 }   \\right\\ } \\left ( 1 -   \\frac{\\omega_g^2}{\\omega_s^2 } \\right)^{-1}\\;.\\ ] ] this term coincides with the first - order correction for the sound waves given in equation ( [ eq_sds1 ] ) for zero background expansion but divided by @xmath205 . for @xmath206 ,",
    "this is not surprising because the acoustic  gravity waves behave in that case like sound waves of the same wavelength but with a smaller frequency .",
    "similarly as for the sound domain , for this mode there is only one critical wavelength , obtained solving @xmath207 .",
    "for completeness ( and later use in section [ s_astr ] ) , we briefly discuss in this section two results for perturbations in the conduction and cooling domains .      at small enough spatial scale (",
    "a ) thermal conduction is the dominant process and ( b ) @xmath208 is much smaller than @xmath52 , @xmath209 and @xmath55 , so that @xmath210 .",
    "two simple consequences of the foregoing are : ( 1 ) conduction can eliminate any temperature gradients well before the sound waves can cross a wavelength and ( 2 ) the evolution of the dominant processes ( conduction and sound propagation ) occurs without important evolution of the background through cooling and expansion .",
    "the solutions to zero and first wkb order must thus coincide with the solutions obtained by @xcite , viz .  a condensation mode at zero order and quasi - isothermal sound waves at first order .",
    "the condensation mode evolves on the timescale of the thermal conduction , @xmath64 .",
    "using this fact in equations ( [ eq_rho1])([eq_p1 ] ) one obtains @xmath211 , @xmath212 and @xmath213 the condensation mode at small length - scales is therefore completely stabilized by conduction . as a consequence of the smallness of @xmath68 , to obtain the wkb solutions for this mode it is necessary to use a third order differential equation for @xmath214 instead of the differential equation ( [ eq_rho3 ] ) for @xmath68 .      at large enough wavelength , cooling , expansion and/or self - gravity dominate , so that the following ordering of timescales applies : @xmath215 . whenever cooling or expansion dominate , no wkb solutions can be calculated , since in that case background and perturbation evolve on the same or comparable timescales . however , a zero order solution can be obtained by direct inspection of equations ( [ eq_rho1 ] ) through ( [ eq_p1 ] ) when there is a single dominant process .",
    "for instance , if cooling is the single dominant process , we expect the zero order solution to have a growth rate of order @xmath216 for all relative perturbations @xmath68 , @xmath217 and @xmath214 . inserting that timescale into equations ( [ eq_rho1])-([eq_p1 ] )",
    "one finds : @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "this perturbation evolves at almost constant density because the propagation of sound is much slower than the growth by cooling .",
    "the growth rate at zero order can be obtained from the previous considerations and equations ( [ eq_p1 ] ) and ( [ eq_coe4 ] ) : @xmath220 @xcite obtained this growth rate for the perturbed entropy using equation ( [ entrlag ] ) with @xmath190 .",
    "we consider the thermal stability of an optically thin astrophysical medium at a temperature in the range @xmath221k which is undergoing net cooling . the medium is assumed to be uniform ( or only weakly non - uniform in the sense of eq .",
    "[ [ eq_aplibackuni ] ] ) .",
    "old snrs and super - bubbles are examples of such a medium .",
    "the generalized field length , which can be computed using the results of section [ sec_appl_conds ] , separates the stable regions from the unstable ones in wavenumber fourier space .",
    "self - gravity can be ignored because for the considered medium the jeans length is usually much larger than the field one .",
    "assuming no heating and permanent ionization equilibrium , the cooling function only depends on the instantaneous properties of the medium and can be expressed as follows : @xmath222 where @xmath145 is the electron number density , @xmath143 is the total number density of hydrogen ( atoms and ions ) and @xmath223 is a function that only depends on temperature .",
    "we use the function @xmath224 provided by j. c. raymond ( 2001 , private communication ) for standard abundances and @xmath225@xmath144 ( see fig .  [ fig_apl1 ] ) , which is an improved version of the cooling function of @xcite . for @xmath226k ,",
    "the function @xmath224 has a very weak dependence on @xmath143 , which can be safely neglected in the present context . in the considered temperature range , @xmath227 and the thermal conduction coefficient , @xmath140 ,",
    "is given by equation ( [ eq_condspit ] ) .",
    "a number of authors have suggested a substantial reduction of @xmath140 in the intergalactic medium due to , for instance , kinetic instabilities driven by temperature gradients ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a tangled magnetic field , which makes the effective mean free path of electrons smaller ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and may cause magnetic mirroring ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , as is usual , we include a constant factor @xmath228 , with value between @xmath18 and @xmath29 , multiplying the conduction coefficient @xmath140 .",
    "the generalized field length , @xmath194 , can be calculated inserting the cooling function ( [ eq_coolthin ] ) into the growth rates ( [ eq_sdc1 ] ) and ( [ eq_sds1 ] ) for the condensation and sound modes , respectively , and setting them equal to zero . the result is : @xmath229^{-1}\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath230 for the condensation mode and @xmath231 for the sound waves . in equation ( [ eq_kcriapli ] ) ,",
    "@xmath232 and all quantities are evaluated in the background . if the logarithmic temperature gradient of @xmath223 is positive and steep enough , the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq_kcriapli ] ) becomes negative and there is no critical length : the corresponding mode is stable at that temperature for all wavelengths .",
    "it is instructive to compare equation ( [ eq_kcriapli ] ) with the classical field length ( sec .",
    "[ sec_appl_conds ] ) , i.e. , the critical length if the background were in thermal equilibrium through the action of a heating which exactly compensates the cooling .",
    "since we are interested primarily in the destabilizing effect of the cooling , we assume a density and temperature  independent heating .",
    "the classical field length is also given by equation ( [ eq_kcriapli ] ) but with @xmath233 for the condensation mode and @xmath234 for the sound waves . from these values of @xmath235 , comparing them with the values obtained above ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_apli2 ] ) , we gather that there are more ( and wider ) unstable temperature ranges in the case with net background cooling than in the classical field problem .",
    "in fact , the difference is quite striking for the sound waves , which change from stable to unstable almost everywhere if one suppresses the heating providing thermal equilibrium .",
    "figure [ fig_apli3 ] shows the instability regions and the critical lengths in the two  dimensional parameter space ( @xmath129 , @xmath236 ) .",
    "the upper diagram corresponds to the sound waves , the lower one to the condensation mode . in the dark  grey shaded region ,",
    "both the classical field problem and the case with net background cooling are unstable , whereas in the light ",
    "grey shaded region only the latter is unstable .",
    "as expected , the instability region for the sound waves is much larger for the case with net background cooling . for the condensation mode ,",
    "both regions are comparable , but , again , the range of unstable temperatures is smaller for the classical field problem . in fact , the ranges of instability for sound waves and condensation mode are similar when there is net background cooling , which is in strong contrast to the situation in the classical field problem .",
    "the upper left corner of each diagram corresponds to a region where cooling is dominant ( i.e. , it occurs on the fastest time - scale of the problem ) .",
    "hence , there are no properly defined sound waves in that region ( hatched area in the upper diagram ) .",
    "the critical length expression ( [ eq_kcriapli ] ) is valid only when sound is the dominant process , which happens within the region delimited by the curves @xmath237 ( dotted line ) and @xmath238 ( dash  dotted line ) in the diagram .",
    "however , we know that the region below the @xmath237  line is stable , since conduction is dominant . similarly , in the cooling - dominated region ( i.e. , well above the dash - dotted line ) , where conduction is negligible , we know the instability properties of the condensation mode both for the classical field problem and for the case with net background cooling using an isochoric criterion as explained in section [ s_cooling ] .",
    "the remaining unknown region is , thus , a ( possibly narrow ) band around the @xmath238  line .",
    "we have tentatively indicated this band in the figure as a cross  hatched region . as a final remark ,",
    "note that the use of the parameter @xmath239 in the figure is meaningful because we have ignored the weak dependence of the coulomb logarithm on @xmath145 ( see eq .",

    "we will also use the symbol @xmath261 for @xmath262 .",

    "we have carried out a systematic analysis of the thermal stability of a uniform medium which , in the unperturbed state , is undergoing net cooling and expansion , so that the problem is * not * amenable to a full fourier normal mode analysis .",
    "thermal conduction and self - gravity have also been included as fundamental ingredients .",
    "the small - perturbation problem yields a system of ordinary differential equations with three independent solutions . in many cases ,",
    "two of them have the character of oscillatory modes ( typically sound waves , or , more generally , acoustic - gravity modes ) and the third one is a non - oscillatory ( or condensation ) solution .",
    "the wavelength of the perturbation determines the positions of the different physical processes in the hierarchy of timescales . at small enough wavelength",
    ", thermal conduction damps the condensation mode and makes sound waves isothermal . at large wavelength ,",
    "one or a few of the following processes are dominant : cooling , self - gravity and expansion .",
    "for example , if cooling is the only dominant process , the perturbation evolving on the fastest timescale is isochoric with no sound waves present that could even out the pressure gradients . at intermediate wavelength ,",
    "the propagation of sound is the fastest process , so the evolution of the condensation mode is isobaric . in the paper ,",
    "solutions have been obtained in a number of instances using the wkb method .",
    "wkb solutions can be found only if two conditions are fulfilled : ( 1 ) there is a clear separation of timescales between _ fast _ and _ slow _ physical processes in the system , and ( 2 ) the background expansion and cooling belong to the _ slow _ category .    of special interest in this paper are those solutions whose growth rate is of the same order as the rate of change of the unperturbed background . in this case , the change in time of the critical wavelengths ( the generalized field length , @xmath194 , and the jeans length , @xmath201 ) may make the perturbation go through totally different stability regimes during their evolution .",
    "for example , the solutions obtained in section [ s_sougr ] for a medium undergoing net cooling include a condensation mode initially in the stable range whose wavelength becomes larger than the field length after some time , thus becoming thermally unstable .",
    "later on , the jeans length decreases sufficiently so that the perturbation also becomes gravitationally unstable .",
    "a sound wave may undergo a similar process of change of stability , first being in a stable regime with slowly decreasing amplitude , then becoming thermally unstable and finally , when the self - gravity frequency becomes comparable with the sound frequency , turning into an acoustic - gravity mode which ends up as a gravitationally - dominated perturbation .",
    "the analysis of the present paper shows ( section [ s_astr ] ) that in a medium undergoing a realistic net cooling the sound waves are thermally unstable for a comparable range of wavelengths and temperatures as the condensation mode .",
    "this may come as a surprise : in contrast , and by way of example , if the thermal equilibrium is reached by balancing the cooling with a constant heating , the sound waves are stable for almost all temperatures in the range @xmath275  @xmath276 whereas the condensation mode continues being unstable . on the other hand ,",
    "the inclusion of a weak magnetic field has a strong influence on the thermal conduction . for astrophysical environments such as the hot ism and the hot igm ,",
    "the generalized field length along the magnetic field is many orders of magnitude larger than in the perpendicular direction .",
    "therefore , the unstable condensations will be filaments directed along the magnetic field lines .    for the description of the astrophysical systems in which thermal instabilities appear , it is important to study the non - linear phase of both condensation mode and sound waves .",
    "the unstable sound waves develop pairs of shock fronts and rarefaction waves , as known from elementary hydrodynamics .",
    "the condensation mode , instead , just continues growing without propagating .",
    "the detailed physics of the nonlinear phase has to be calculated , in general , using numerical means .",
    "yet , a number of results can be advanced at this stage .",
    "for instance , in the linear analysis , a perturbation with negative @xmath68 grows ( in absolute value ) as fast as a perturbation with positive @xmath68 .",
    "this symmetry is broken in the non - linear evolution . in a medium undergoing net cooling , for example , a condensation with positive @xmath68 ( negative @xmath185 ) grows faster than one with @xmath277 .",
    "this happens because of the sum of the following two processes .",
    "first , thermal conduction grows with temperature .",
    "therefore , a condensation with positive @xmath185 is more damped by thermal conduction than a negative one .",
    "second , in the range @xmath278 cooling increases toward lower temperatures ( fig .  [ fig_apl1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , a condensation with negative @xmath185 is more destabilized by cooling than a positive one .",
    "a related aspect is that the characteristic spatial size ( width at half height ) of a condensation decreases by orders of magnitude during its evolution .",
    "this happens because the coldest zones of the perturbation cool much faster than the warmer ones .",
    "the last aspect can be seen in the paper of @xcite , where the non - linear evolution of a perturbation of this type is computed numerically .    in the weakly ",
    "magnetized case , at the beginning of the non - linear evolution ( @xmath279 ) , the compression in the filament proceeds mainly in the directions perpendicular to the magnetic field lines .",
    "this is because of the reduction of thermal conduction transversely to the field lines : a much higher temperature ( and thus pressure ) gradient can be maintained across than along the field lines .",
    "the plasma @xmath242 inside the condensation decreases with time because of the temperature decrease and the growth of magnetic field due to the compression . in the advanced non - linear phase , the perpendicular compression comes to a halt once @xmath280 , since then the net force across the field lines ( the gradient of the sum of magnetic and thermal pressures ) is almost decoupled from temperature .",
    "after this , the compression is only possible along the field lines . as a related example , see @xcite , which numerically compute the non - linear evolution of a planar condensation taking into account magnetic pressure .",
    "the wkb analysis that we have carried out in this paper assumes a uniform background",
    ". however , our results are also applicable for a weakly non - uniform background .",
    "more in detail , our results for the condensation mode in the sound domain are valid if the brunt - visl frequency associated with the background entropy gradient is much smaller than the growth rate of the condensation mode .",
    "this holds , for example , in the supersonic region of a wind and inside old snrs and superbubbles .",
    "in contrast , for the study of the thermal instability in cooling flows in clusters of galaxies , the buoyancy of the perturbations must be taken into account .",
    "many authors have studied this problem : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , in particular , conclude that a magnetic field , even a weak one , can inhibit buoyancy and trigger thermal instability , which otherwise would be small due to buoyancy .",
    "the extension of the results of the present paper to environments of this type requires additional work .",
    "financiation through dges project pb95 - 0028c of the spanish ministry of education is acknowledged .",
    "the authors are grateful to dr j.  c.  raymond for providing them with the cooling functions used in this paper .",
