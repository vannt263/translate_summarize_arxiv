    "both cdf@xcite and @xcite have reported on the search for an excess of events containing two high-@xmath5 photons and significant missing transverse energy .",
    "the results have been interpreted in the framework of a model of gauge - mediated supersymmetry - breaking ( gmsb ) with a neutralino as the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle .",
    "the details of the model were chosen at the snowmass workshop@xcite .",
    "the complexity of a gmsb model is reduced to a one  parameter model , or model  line , that is qualitatively representative of the phenomenology . the model ",
    "line is defined as a function of a single mass parameter , @xmath6 , which is varied to scan the masses of the particles in the model . at the tevatron",
    ", this model allows for a significant production of the lightest chargino and second - lightest neutralino .",
    "these particles undergo a cascade decay to the lightest neutralino , which itself decays to a photon and a gravitino .",
    "the searches require two identified photons and large missing @xmath0 .    since the two experiments investigated the same model ",
    "line , the mechanics of the combination are straightforward .",
    "the details are explained in section iv . as the cross sections and detection efficiencies vary along the model ",
    "line , the particle mass limits are set at the highest mass where the model can be excluded .",
    "we will report the limits on chargino mass and @xmath6 . for clarity",
    ", we will discuss the details of the results for a chargino mass of approximately 200  gev/@xmath7 , which is near the combined limit , and summarize information for other mass points .",
    "the experiments chose different arbitrary mass points to measure efficiencies , so the cdf measurements have been interpolated to the masses . in the following sections , we report the information that enters the combination : efficiency , luminosity , background expectations and data observations .",
    "the cdf analysis requires that each event has a reconstructed interaction vertex , the absolute value of the vertex @xmath8 is less than 60  cm and the event passes the one of the diphoton triggers . both photons must be reconstructed in the central detector ( @xmath9 ) with @xmath10  gev and pass fiducial cuts . for isolation cdf requires @xmath0 in a @xmath11 cone of 0.4 to be less than @xmath12 if @xmath13  gev , and @xmath14 if @xmath15  gev .",
    "photon identification also includes requirements on tracking isolation , the ratio of hadronic to electromagnetic energy , and shower shape .",
    "the topological cuts require that the   does not point along or opposite to a jet and that there is no evidence of a cosmic ray or beam  related accidental energy deposition .",
    "the   cut is 45  gev .",
    "the total acceptance times efficiency for signal events with a chargino mass of 200  gev@xmath4 is 7.3% .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on the efficiency of the photon identification cuts is 13% , determined from the variation of the result using different techniques .",
    "varying the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) causes a 5% change in the efficiency . varying",
    "the initial and final  state radiation implies a 10% systematic uncertainty and varying the hard scale @xmath16 gives a 3% systematic uncertainty on the acceptance times efficiency .",
    "the analysis includes @xmath17  pb@xmath3 , where the uncertainty is systematic , coming from the inelastic cross section and the total detector acceptance for inelastic events .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    the analysis requires that both photons are reconstructed in the central calorimeter ( @xmath18 ) and have @xmath19 gev .",
    "the events are triggered by a combination of single ",
    "cluster and two  cluster electromagnetic triggers .",
    "the events are required to have a reconstructed vertex and not to exhibit patterns of correlated calorimeter noise .",
    "photon clusters are selected from all calorimeter clusters by requiring that : ( i ) at least 90% of the energy is deposited in the em section of the calorimeter , ( ii ) the calorimeter isolation variable @xmath20/e_{em}(0.2)$ ] is less than 0.15 , where @xmath21 is the total energy in a cone of radius 0.4 in @xmath22 space and @xmath23 is the em energy in a cone of radius 0.2 , ( iii ) the transverse and longitudinal shower profiles are consistent with those expected for an em shower , and ( iv ) the scalar sum of the @xmath24 of all tracks in annulus of @xmath25 around the cluster is less than 2 gev@xmath26 .",
    "finally , to reject electrons , photon candidates are required to have no central track well - matched to the cluster .",
    "the efficiency for photon reconstruction and identification was obtained by reconstructing monte carlo events passed through a detailed geant simulation of the detector .",
    "the simulation was verified by comparing to @xmath27 data .",
    "special attention has been paid to efficiency dependence on the number of jets in the event and on the distance between the electron and the closest jet .",
    "the estimated systematic uncertainty on total efficiency from photon acceptance and identification cuts is 8% .",
    "the   in the event is required to be larger than 40  gev .",
    "the event must also pass topological cuts on the direction of , namely that it is not opposite to the leading jet ( if present ) or along any of the photons .",
    "the total efficiency for a chargino mass of 196  gev@xmath4 is 14.9% .",
    "in addition to the acceptance and photon identification uncertainty , there is an additional systematic uncertainty coming from the choice of pdf ( 5% ) and monte carlo statistics ( 4% ) .",
    "the analysis includes @xmath28  pb@xmath3 , where the uncertainty is systematic , coming from the inelastic cross section and the detector acceptance for inelastic events .",
    "the systematic uncertainties on the efficiencies of photon identification variables are assumed to be uncorrelated since the two analyses are based on different detectors , cuts and methods . since the 5% pdf systematic originates from the same source for both experiments , and reflects effects such as changing particle @xmath24 , which would affect both experiments similarly , the 5% pdf systematics are assumed 100% correlated .",
    "since both experiments base their luminosity estimates on the same inelastic cross section measurement , and both base their acceptance on the same monte carlo generator , the luminosity systematics are assumed to be 100% correlated .",

    ".    observed 2 events passing all cuts .      since only has a significant qcd background , its uncertainty is uncorrelated with cdf . the systematic uncertainty on the @xmath31 background is considered to be uncorrelated since is dominated by statistics .",

    "the combination proceeds using the data in table [ tab : combo ] and the prescription from @xcite .",
    "the method forms a bayesian likelihood from the product of likelihoods of the individual experiments , with flat priors .",
    "each correlated and uncorrelated systematic uncertainty is represented by an appropriate gaussian function .",
    "finally we integrate over all parameters except the cross section , and integrate the cross section to the 95% confidence level point .",
    "the table also includes the expected limit for the experiments and the combination .",
