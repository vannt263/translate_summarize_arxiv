    "in the last decade it has been reached a general consensus that ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( urhics ) at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) create a hot and dense strongly interacting quark and gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite .",
    "a main discovery has been that the qgp has a very small shear viscosity to entropy density , @xmath0 , which is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the one of water  @xcite , and close to the lower bound of @xmath4 conjectured for systems at infinite strong coupling @xcite .",
    "a key observable to reach such a conclusion is the elliptic flow  @xcite , @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , the expansion of the created matter generates a large anisotropy of the emitted particles that can be primarily measured by @xmath6 .",
    "the origin of @xmath6 is the initial spatial eccentricity , @xmath7 of the overlap region in non - central collisions , which is responsible for different pressure gradients in the transverse plane thus favoring flow preferably along the @xmath8 direction rather than @xmath9 direction .",
    "the observed large @xmath6 is considered a signal of a very small @xmath0 because if @xmath0 was large then viscosity would damp flow , hence reducing anisotropy in momentum space .",
    "calculations agree in indicating an average @xmath0 of the qgp lying in the range @xmath10  @xcite .    along with the existence of a deconfined qgp matter and the understanding of its properties , the urhic",
    "program offers the opportunity to verify the picture in which the two colliding nuclei are described as two sheets of color glass condensate ( cgc )  @xcite .",
    "the cgc would be generated by the very high density of the gluon distribution function at low @xmath8 ( parton longitudinal momentum fraction ) , which triggers a saturation of the distribution for @xmath3 below a saturation scale , @xmath11 .",
    "the determination of the shear viscosity @xmath0 of the qgp and the search for the cgc are related : in fact the uncertainty on the initial condition translates into an uncertainty on the theoretical estimate of @xmath0  @xcite .    in this",
    "talk we report our results @xcite about the computation of the elliptic flow of the quark - gluon - plasma produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions , simulating the expansion of the fireball by solving the relativistic boltzmann equation for the parton distribution function tuned at a fixed shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using kinetic theory is that starting from a one - body phase space distribution function @xmath12 , and not from the energy - momentum tensor @xmath13 , it is straightforward to initialize simulations from a non - equilibrium distribution function , while hydrodynamics relies on the gradient expansion of the stress tensor and therefore is applicable only if initial deviations from local equilibrium are small .    in this study",
    "we will consider several kinds of initial conditions , two of them related to the shattering of the cgc which takes place after the collision . for describing the latter we make use of the kln model  @xcite , which has been largely employed to study the dynamics of hic and the viscosity of the qgp within hydrodynamical simulations  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in the initial condition translates into an uncertainty on @xmath0 of at a least a factor of two as estimated by mean of several viscous hydrodynamical approaches @xcite .",
    "we point out that the implementation of the shattered cgc initialization in hydrodynamics takes into account only the different space distribution respect to a geometric glauber model , discarding the key and more peculiar feature of the damping of the distribution for @xmath3 below the @xmath11 saturation scale .",
    "we have found by mean of kinetic theory that this has a significant impact on the build - up of @xmath6 , hence on the determination of @xmath0 .    in our study",
    "we neglect the initial time evolution of the chromo - electric and chromo - magnetic fields ( the glasma ) produced immediately after the collision . according to the commonly accepted picture of heavy ion collisions ,",
    "our approach should be justified as soon as the initial strong fields decay into particle quanta .",
    "characteristic time for the glasma decay is of the order of @xmath14 , which turns out to be of the order of a fraction of fm / c  @xcite . from this time on the field contribution to",
    "the pressure is less important , and the dynamics is dominated by the scatterings among partons , which justifies the use of kinetic theory to describe the sequent evolution of the system .",
    "the advantage to use kinetic theory from @xmath15 rather than hydro is that the nonequilibrium initial distribution is not problematic as kinetic theory is built to study the evolution of a generic @xmath12 distribution function .",
    "in this section we specify the initial conditions we implement in our simulations .",
    "the first one is based on the glauber model , see  @xcite for a review , with an @xmath16-space distribution given by the a standard mixture @xmath17 and a @xmath18-space thermalized spectrum in the transverse plane at a time @xmath19 for the rhic runs and @xmath20 fm / c for the lhc runs .",
    "maximum temperature is assumed @xmath21 gev for the au - au collisions at rhic energy and @xmath22 gev for the pb - pb collisions at lhc energy .",
    "we also assume @xmath23 at @xmath24 , where @xmath25 corresponds to space - time rapidity ; we also assume boost invariance in the longitudinal direction at @xmath26 which implies independence of the initial distribution on @xmath9 . following the nomenclature introduced in",
    "@xcite we will refer to this case as th - glauber .",
    "the other two kinds of initial conditions we use in our simulations  @xcite are based on a model of gluon production for the shattered cgc named factorized - kln ( fkln in the following )  @xcite , in which the initial spectrum is assumed to be @xmath27 the coordinate space distribution is obtained by integration of the above equation over @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath29 correspond to transverse momentum and momentum rapidity of the produced gluons respectively , and @xmath30 . in eq .",
    "@xmath31 denote the probability to find one nucleon at a given transverse coordinate , @xmath32^a$ ] where @xmath33 is the inelastic cross section and @xmath34 corresponds to the usual thickness function of the glauber model .",
    "the overall constant @xmath35 in eq .   is fixed in order to reproduce the experimental multiplicity in the most central collisions .",
    "the specific form of the unintegrated gluon distribution function for gluons @xmath36 is not important here ; it is enough to remind that it embeds saturation in the sense that @xmath36 as a function of @xmath3 is constant for @xmath37 , where @xmath11 corresponds to the saturation scale .",
    "here we show results obtained within a parameter set such that @xmath38 gev for the most central collisions at longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath39 .",
    "having described the fkln model we are now ready to define the other two kinds of initializations we use in simulations .",
    "firstly we assume that both the initial @xmath3-spectrum and the coordinate space distribution are given by eq .   and its integral over @xmath28 , which corresponds to the proper implementation of the fkln model .",
    "we call this initialization as fkln initialization . this kind of initial condition is not implemented in hydro simulations because the initial strong deviation from equilibrium can not be studied within viscous hydrodynamics . in the fkln initialization",
    "we assume @xmath40 fm / c because no assumption on equilibration needs to be introduced ; this time can be interpreted as the time needed for the strong initial fields to decay to a parton liquid , as explained in the introduction . on the other hand",
    ", we also consider another initial condition which is close to the one usually implemented in hydro simulations , in which we assume the coordinate space distribution given by the kln model and a @xmath3-thermalized spectrum . in this way",
    "we assume some thermalization occured in a short time , leaving at the same time the distribution in coordinate space unaffected .",
    "we call this initialization as th - fkln initialization . for the latter we assume the same initialization times used for the th - glauber model . in the two cases we assume @xmath23 at @xmath41 .",
    "for the dynamical evolution of the initial conditions we employ transport theory as a base of a simulation code of the fireball expansion created in relativistic heavy - ion collision  @xcite ; we assume the system can be described by a gluon distribution function @xmath42 which evolves according to the relativistic boltzmann transport ( rbt ) equation : @xmath43 with @xmath44 , and @xmath45 corresponds to the transition amplitude . at variance with the standard use of transport theory",
    "we have developed an approach that , instead of focusing on specific microscopic calculations of the scattering matrix , fixes the total cross section cell by cell in the grids in order to have a wished value of @xmath0 . by means of this procedure",
    "we translate transport theory to hydrodynamical language since we use the boltzmann equation to simulate the dynamical evolution of a fluid which dissipates with a specified shear viscosity , in analogy to what is done within hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "hence this approach offers a bridge between transport theory and hydrodynamics .",
    "the advantage of the kinetic theory approach at fixed @xmath0 , compared to hydro simulations , is twofold : the initial condition does not need to be close to thermal equilibrium , because we do not perform a gradient expansion of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "moreover we do not need to specify an ansatz for the deviations from equilibrium .",
    "this approach to kinetic theory has been also considered in  @xcite where it has been shown that transport theory at fixed @xmath0 reproduces the results of viscous hydrodynamics for one - body observable like @xmath13 or entropy density also in the limit in which the system is not in the dilute regime .",
    "this is not surprising because looking at the boltzmann collision integral in terms of viscosity allows the analytical derivation of second order viscous hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "despite the fact we consider only the @xmath46 processes to compute the collision integral , once the system is close to the hydro regime with many collisions happening in a short time range , the detail of the single scattering is lost and what matters is only the viscosity of the fluid and not the specific microscopic process producing such viscosity .",
    "we have checked we work in a regime where the specific process is not relevant by changing the microscopic two - body scattering matrix from anisotropic to isotropic and adjusting the total cross section to keep the same @xmath0 .",
    "we have found that leaving unchanged all the other parameters , the elliptic flow is not affected by this change for @xmath47 gev  @xcite .    once @xmath0 is fixed , we compute the total cross section in each cell of the coordinate space of our grid .",
    "the chapmann - enskog approximation supplies the relation between @xmath0 an cross section with quite good approximation , in agreement with the results obtained using the green kubo formula  @xcite : @xmath48 which is valid for a generic differential cross section @xmath49  @xcite . in the above equation @xmath50 , with @xmath51 the screening mass regulating the angular dependence of the cross section , while @xmath52 corresponds to a function",
    "whose analytic form can be found in @xcite . in the regime",
    "were viscous hydrodynamic applies ( not too large @xmath0 and @xmath3 ) the specific microscopic detail of the cross section is irrelevant and our approach is an effective way to employ transport theory to simulate a fluid at a given @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 we use in our study @xcite is as follows : in the plasma phase it is a constant , whose numerical value is fixed case by case ; we then implement a kinetic freezout by assuming that @xmath0 increases smoothly in a temperature range from the plasma phase to a hadron phase values which is fixed by referring to the estimates in  @xcite . in this way we take into account scatterings in the hadron phase as well , which however give a very tiny contribution to the collective flow because of the damping due to the larger viscosity .",

    "is obtained by th - fkln with @xmath75 , because momentum distribution is the same but initial eccentricity of th - fkln is larger than the one of the th - glauber initial condition , requiring a larger viscosity in the former case to damp the flow .",
    "these results are in agreement with the ones obtained from viscous hydrodynamics @xcite , showing the solidity and consistency of our transport approach at fixed @xmath0 .",

    "[ fig : v2pt ] , with the proper distribution function implemented in both the @xmath16 and @xmath18 spaces .",

    "in other words the initial out - of - equilibrium fkln distribution reduces the efficiency in converting @xmath78 into @xmath6 .",

    "@xcite.,width=283 ]    the effect we find on @xmath6 is more important for peripheral collisions .",
    "in fact in fig .  [",
    "fig : v2riass ] we plot @xmath6 at @xmath81 gev for different initializations , as a function of the number of participants .",
    "this figure permits to visualize and summarize the dependence of @xmath76 on the centrality class , comparing the impact of the initial distribution on the final @xmath6 .",
    "we notice that the discrepancy between th - fkln and fkln initializations becomes less relevant for more central collisions , implying that the effect of the initial momentum distribution is not negligible if one considers non - central collisions .",
    "we also note that for central collisions at rhic th - glauber and th - fkln for @xmath55 predict the same @xmath6 and the effect is of kln generating larger @xmath6 disappears .",
    "this is seen also in viscous hydro simulation and it is a further confirmation that our approach converge to viscous hydro when the same thermal initial conditions are employed .",
    "in this talk we have reported our results @xcite on thermalization and building - up of the elliptic flow for fireballs produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions both at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "we have put emphasis on the role of a nonequilibrium initial condition on the generation of the collective flow , when the kln initialization is properly implemented in coordinate and momentum space .",
    "our study is based on kinetic theory at fixed @xmath0 . fixing the shear viscosity over entropy density ratio permits to forget about microscopic processes which give that specific value of the ratio itself , and to focus on the effect of shear viscosity on thermalization , isotropization and building of the collective flows .",
    "for what concerns thermalization , in both rhic and lhc runs we have found that thermalization times are @xmath82 0.8 - 1 fm / c .",
    "we have then focused our attention on the elliptic flow production when the initial distribution has a saturation scale built in it .",
    "we have found that the amount of elliptic flow produced in heavy ion collisions depends not only on the pressure gradients and the @xmath0 of the system , but also on the initial distribution in momentum space . in particular ,",
    "an initial condition characterized by a momentum distribution with a saturation scale generates smaller @xmath6 respect to the thermal one . assuming the fkln distribution as the one arising from the shattering of the cgc , the effect of the initial nonequilibrium distribution affects the estimate of @xmath0 of about a factor of two .",
    "however we have also that this effect is maximal for semi - peripheral collisions , becoming quite small for very central collisions .    in order to make more precise comparison with experimental data we are currently implementing also fluctuating initial conditions which will allow to extend the present study to all the @xmath83 harmonics relevant in hic s .",
    "this will allow to see if fkln can account for the measured @xmath84 or the non - equilibrium damps such harmonics even more than what seen in hydrodynamics . in  @xcite it is found that harmonics up to the fifth order can be reproduced by combining cym early - time with hydro late - evolution evolutions ; however in the calculations of  @xcite a small deviation from equilibrium has to be assumed in order to use viscous hydrodynamical equations",
    ". therefore it will be interesting to compute the higher order harmonics combining the cym initial spectrum with the dynamics embedded in the kinetic equations where the assumption of sudden thermalization can be relaxed , which will be the subject of future studies .",
