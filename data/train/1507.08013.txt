    "the dc contains 1218 hexagonal cells and allows to measure charged particle momentum with 1.5 - 4.5@xmath23 accuracy in the 100 - 1000 mev / c range , and provides the measurement of the polar ( @xmath24 ) and azimuthal ( @xmath25 ) angles with 20 mrad and 3.5 - 8.0 mrad accuracy , respectively .",

    "in the studied energy range nucleons have low velocity and high ionization losses . according to mc simulation , when the beam energy is less than 950 mev , all protons and antiprotons stop in the beam pipe or in the inner dc shell , and antiprotons annihilate producing several secondary particles .",
