    "one of the basic ingredients of quantum communication is the transport of a known or unknown quantum state from one point to another @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown that quantum spin chains can act as channels for the efficient @xcite or perfect @xcite transfer of quantum states .",
    "of particular interest to us here is the works reported in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that this scheme may be used for linking several small quantum processers in large scale quantum computing . in this scheme",
    ", an @xmath0-site ferromagnetic heisenberg spin chain placed in a magnetic field , plays the role of the quantum channel .",
    "the spins of the channel are numbered from @xmath1 to @xmath0 .",
    "it is assumed that this chain is in its ground state , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the state of a spin in the negative @xmath4 direction and the magnetic field points to the positive @xmath4 direction .",
    "one then adds a spin or qubit to the left hand side of this channel labeled by zero , which is in an unknown state @xmath5 ( figure 1-a ) .",
    "the state of this qubit is to be transmitted with a high fidelity to the right hand side , by the natural time evolution of the chain .",
    "+ in this way one may circumvent a problem which exists in quantum computer implementation namely the difficulty of switching on and off between spins@xcite .",
    "+    [ mychain2 ]   is placed at site @xmath6 of the chain and is transported to site @xmath0 by the dynamics of the spin chain .",
    "b- the entanglement of a bell state @xmath7 placed at sites @xmath8 and @xmath6 develops into the entanglement of sites @xmath8 and @xmath0.,title=\"fig:\",width=377,height=755 ]    the hamiltonians governing the interaction of the spins in the channel and the full chain are respectively @xmath9 and @xmath10    where the subscript `` c '' on @xmath11 stands for the channel . if at time @xmath12 the qubit @xmath6 is placed to the left of the chain then the evolution of the heisenberg chain carries the state of this qubit to the rightmost spin @xmath0 where one extracts the state with a rather high fidelity , provided that one extracts the state at an optimal time .",
    "+ it has been shown in @xcite that one can transmit quantum states with a high fidelity ranging from @xmath13 for @xmath14 to a value exceeding @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the fidelity generally decreases with increasing the length of the channel exceeds the classical value of @xmath18 for @xmath19 which holds for classical transmission of quantum states@xcite .",
    "+ one can also use this channel for transmission of entanglement in the following way @xcite .",
    "one places two maximally entangled spins labeled @xmath8 and @xmath6 to the left of the chain ( figure 1-b ) and evolution of the chain after a suitable lapse of time entangles the spin @xmath8 to the rightmost spin @xmath0 here it is assumed that only the spin @xmath6 is coupled to the channel . in this way two distant spins can be entangled which can later be used for implementation of other quantum protocols like teleportation @xcite .",
    "+ the formalism of @xcite requires that the spins of the channel be ideally aligned in the direction opposite to that of the magnetic field .",
    "this ideal situation is however achievable only at zero temperature or in very strong magnetic fields where thermal fluctuations are not large enough to populate excited states , i.e. ( when @xmath20 ) . on the other hand",
    "increasing the magnetic field may lower the quality of the channel since a high magnetic field tends to align the spins and will generally dominate the interaction between the spins which is essential for the working of the channel .",
    "+ moreover when one uses this channel once and extracts the state at the right hand site , the initial state of the channel turns into a mixed state . before using the channel for another round of transmission",
    "the initial state of the channel should be restored , for example by cooling to low enough temperatures .",
    "it is plausible to assume that multiple uses of the channel may heat it up to temperatures in which not only the ground state but also some of the excited states are also populated .",
    "+ in view of these considerations it is desirable to study the effect of thermal fluctuations on such a quantum channel .",
    "this is the problem that we want to address in this paper .",
    "thus we want to generalize the protocol of @xcite to the case where the initial state of the channel is not the ground state but a thermal state given by a thermal density matrix .",
    "+ this enables us to to see the effect of the ambient temperature on the feasibility of the protocol , and the quantitative effect that temperature has on the fidelity of transmission of states and distribution of entanglement .",
    "+ we will derive a low temperature expansion through which we can study the effect of temperature to any desired degree of accuracy by keeping appropriate number of terms in the expansion .",
    "+ in a sequel to this paper we will study long chains of arbitrary number of spins at low temperatures .",
    "this study can be done only numerically . in this paper",
    "however we will study exactly thermal effects on a short chain of four spins .",
    "the advantage of studying this short chain is that we can obtain the spectrum completely and hence can compare the two cases of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic chains .",
    "+ the structure of this paper is as follows : in section [ general ] we set up the general formalism and will develop low temperature expansions for the expressions of fidelity and entanglement . in section [ entanglement ]",
    "we derive general expressions for entanglement of endpoints of the chain at arbitrary temperatures . in section [ example ]",
    "we study exactly the specific example of a short chain of only @xmath21 spins where we present our basic results in figures ( [ fidferro ] to [ conantiferro ] ) .",
    "we consider the interaction between the spins to be nearest neighbor and of heisenberg type .",
    "the spins also interact with an external magnetic field .",
    "we should emphasize that much of what we derive in this section do not depend on a specific form of the hamiltonian .",
    "we assume that the initial state of the channel is @xmath22 where @xmath23 s and @xmath24 s are respectively the eigenstates and eigenenergies of the channel hamiltonian ( [ heis ] ) . here",
    "@xmath25 is the partition function of the channel @xmath26 .",
    "+ at time @xmath12 we place the @xmath6-th spin which is in an unknown pure state @xmath27 to the left of this channel .",
    "the initial state of the whole chain will be given by @xmath28 which evolves to @xmath29 where @xmath11 is now the hamiltonian of the full chain ( [ heis2 ] ) .",
    "+ the state of the @xmath0-th spin after time @xmath30 will be given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 means that we take the trace over all sites except the @xmath0-th site .",
    "we can now derive an operator sum representation for the transformation of the state of the leftmost qubit @xmath33 to the state of the rightmost qubit @xmath34 .",
    "to do this we use ( [ rho(n ) ] ) to compute an element of @xmath34 as follows , where we use the index @xmath35 to run over a complete set of states @xmath36 for the hilbert space of part of the total chain from site @xmath6 to site @xmath37 , and the index @xmath38 is to run over the eigenstates of the channel hamiltonian : @xmath39 defining a collection of two by two matrices @xmath40 with elements @xmath41 we find the following kraus decomposition @xcite for @xmath34 , @xmath42    note that in general the number of elements in this decomposition , i.e. the number of matrices @xmath40 is huge .",
    "in fact this number is equal to the number of different choices for the pair of indices @xmath43 , which equals @xmath44 . in principle",
    "there are many operator sum representations for a superoperator and the number of kraus operators for a qubit can be reduced to @xmath21 @xcite , however the present form has the advantage that it is suitable for a low temperature expansion of the fidelity of the channel .",
    "note also that even in the present form symmetry arguments highly restricts the number of nonzero matrices as we will see in the sequel .",
    "+ the fidelity of this out - state @xmath34 with the in - state @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 we are interested in the fidelity averaged over all the initial input states , that is @xmath47 where the integral is taken over the surface of the bloch sphere .",
    "this integral can further be simplified by using the following easily verified identity @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the swap operator with elements @xmath50 .",
    "we now write @xmath45 as @xmath51 and use the identity @xmath52 to arrive at the following identity @xmath53 which we use to rewrite @xmath54 as    @xmath55    using the facts that @xmath56 and @xmath57 we find the final form of @xmath54 as @xmath58 , the next to leading contribution comes from the first excited states and so on . thus despite the huge number of matrices @xmath40 , at low temperatures one can obtain a reasonably good value of the fidelity by using only the first few terms in the expansion . +      in this limit only the ground state contributes to the expansion ( [ ffinal ] ) . for the ferromagnetic chain the ground state is @xmath59 where all the spins are down .",
    "thus we have @xmath60 in ( [ gs1 ] ) it appears that a set of @xmath61 matrices @xmath62 contribute to the sum .",
    "however we show that by symmetry considerations one can reduce this number to only two . to this end",
    "we note that a general element of @xmath62 can be written as follows : @xmath63 in view of the symmetry @xmath64=0 $ ] where @xmath65 is the total spin in the @xmath4 direction , the only nonzero matrices are those in which the index @xmath35 is either @xmath66 for which we denote the corresponding matrix by @xmath67 , or those in which only one spin is up ( e.g. in the @xmath68-th position @xmath69 for which we denote the corresponding matrix by @xmath70 . + moreover the above mentioned symmetry requires that matrices be of the following form :    @xmath71    where @xmath72    and @xmath73    a simple calculation now shows that the following identity holds for the above types of matrices , regardless of their explicit form of matrix elements , @xmath74 where @xmath75 thus the operator sum representation reduces to a sum with only two elements , i.e. @xmath76    using ( [ gs1 ] ) and noting that the matrix @xmath77 is traceless , we find the average fidelity at zero temperature : @xmath78 for the ferromagnetic chain , the state @xmath79 is also the ground state of the full hamiltonian and thus by shifting the zero energy of the hamiltonian to @xmath6 we can set @xmath80 .",
    "thus we find @xmath81 in accordance with the result of @xcite .",
    "note that our @xmath82 is denoted by @xmath83 in @xcite .",
    "we now consider how temperature affects the distribution of a maximally entangled pair through the channel .",
    "following @xcite we consider a maximally entangled pair of qubits in the state @xmath84 . in figure ( 1-b )",
    "this pair of qubits are labeled by @xmath8 and @xmath6 .",
    "the evolution of the chain may transform the entanglement between the pair @xmath85 to the pair @xmath86 , thus enabling us to transport entanglement between ions or any other realization of qubits over long distances .",
    "note that the hamiltonian only acts on the part of the chain form @xmath6 to @xmath0 .",
    "it is assumed that the qubit @xmath8 does not interact with the rest of the chain . after a time @xmath30 , the density matrix of the pair @xmath86 is easily obtained thanks to the operator sum representation ( [ krausfinal ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath87 using the fact that @xmath88 and the explicit form of the matrix elements of @xmath40 as given in ( [ m ] ) we find after some manipulations the following low temperature expansion : @xmath89 where each @xmath90 pertains to a level @xmath38 of the spectrum of the channel and is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 here the operators @xmath93 are operators in the heisenberg picture , i.e. ( @xmath94 ) . +",
    "thus the concurrence will have the same dependence on the correlation function as in the thermal equilibrium state @xcite , only now the correlation functions are time dependent . +",
    "an exact study of the thermal effects on a long chain with arbitrary number of spins is highly involved , since it requires a knowledge of all the energy eigenstates . on",
    "can study these chains only at low temperatures in which case only the ground state and the first excited states of the chain are populated .",
    "we will do this in a sequel to this paper . here",
    "we study exactly a short spin chain of @xmath95 .",
    "an exact study of a short chain has the advantage that one can compare the characteristically different behaviors of ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic chains .",
    "we remind the reader that at zero temperature the channel relaxes to its ground state which for the ferromagnetic chain is a disentangled state of spins aligned with the magnetic field .",
    "this is the only case which has been studied in @xcite .",
    "+ so we consider a three site channel with hamiltonian given by @xmath96 the spectrum of this hamiltonian is easily obtained and it exist in the appendix .",
    "+ the hamiltonian of the full chain is now @xmath97 determination of the spectrum of this hamiltonian is facilitated by using the following symmetries , namely @xmath98=[h,\\lambda]=[j_z,\\lambda]=0 \\ \\ \\ { \\rm and } \\ \\ \\",
    "\\sigma_x^{\\otimes 4 } h(j , b ) = h(j ,- b )   \\sigma_x^{\\otimes 4},\\ ] ]    where @xmath99 is the inversion operator @xmath100 the spectrums of the total and the channel hamiltonian are derived in the appendix . by plugging these eigenstates and eigenvalues in equations ( [ m ] ) and ( [ ffinal ] )",
    "one can determine the average fidelity of the output state with the input state .",
    "the fidelity is a complicated function of time , in fact it is a superposition of periodic functions with periods @xmath101 . in @xcite one extracts the output state only at certain times where the fidelity reaches a maximum .",
    "since we want to focus on the effect of temperature , we fix the magnetic field and determine the average fidelity as a function of time and temperature .",
    "the results are shown in figure ( [ fidferro ] ) and ( [ fidantiferro ] ) for ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic chains respectively .     and time @xmath30 , in a fixed magnetic field .",
    "in all the figures the fidelity @xmath102 and the concurrence @xmath103 are dimensionless and we are working in units where @xmath104 and @xmath30 have no dimensions . in these units",
    "we have taken @xmath105 and @xmath106 for ferromagnetic and @xmath107 for anti - ferromagnetic chains.,width=377,height=302 ]     and time ( t ) , in a fixed magnetic field @xmath108 , for an anti - ferromagnetic channel @xmath109.,width=377,height=302 ]    these curves show several interesting features .",
    "the first one is that the optimal time of extraction is almost independent of temperature , thus at any temperature one can tune the optimal time of extraction to be the same as that of the zero temperature .",
    "the only effect of temperature is that it decreases the fidelity .",
    "it is also seen that the optimal times when the fidelity reaches local maxima are the same for both types of chains .",
    "moreover thermal fluctuations have much less destructive effect on the fidelity in the anti - ferromagnetic chain as compared with the ferromagnetic chain .",
    "+ the difference between these two types of chains is more pronounced when we use them to transfer entanglement .",
    "we have used these two channels to transfer the maximal entanglement between the two spins @xmath8 and @xmath6 at the left hand side of the chain ( [ mychain2 ] ) to entanglement of the end points of the chains at time @xmath30 , measured by the concurrence of the density matrix @xmath110 . in a fixed magnetic field ,",
    "the concurrence of this density matrix @xcite is a function of temperature .",
    "figures ( [ conferro ] ) and ( [ conantiferro ] ) show this concurrence as a function of temperature and time for the ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic chains respectively .",
    "all the previous comments apply also to this type of behavior .",
    "the striking difference is that in the anti - ferromagnetic chain , there are long intervals of time when no entanglement can be distributed in the chain regardless of the temperature , entanglement transfer is possible only in short periods of time . in fact",
    "comparison of the figures for the fidelity and concurrence shows that when the fidelity of the channel drops below the approximate value of @xmath111 , it no longer can transfer any entanglement .     of the state of the endpoints of the chain as a function of time @xmath30 and @xmath112 in a fixed magnetic field for a ferromagnetic chain . here",

    "we have studied the effect of thermal fluctuations on a recently proposed method for transportation of unknown states through quantum spin chains .",
    "we have developed a low temperature expansion which can be used to calculate this effect to a desired degree of accuracy at any given temperature . as an example we have calculated exactly the effect of thermal fluctuations on transportation of states on a short spin chain and",
    "have shown that the optimal time of extraction of transported states at the end of the chain is almost independent of temperature , the only effect of which is to lower slightly the fidelity of the output state with the input state .",
