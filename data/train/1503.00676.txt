    "since the discovery of the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) in 1980 by von klitzing _ et .",
    "@xcite , the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a strong perpendicular magnetic field has been a subject of intense study , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the iqhe is a macroscopic effect of solid state physics and it is characterized by a quantized hall conductivity which is given by integer multiples of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the electrical charge and @xmath2 is the plancks constant .",
    "the quantization of the hall conductivity has been measured to 1 part in @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this precision reveals the topological nature of the hall conductivity , which does not depend on the material , geometry and microscopic details of the sample , and makes the iqhe very useful in the field of metrology .",
    "the properties of a charged particle in a magnetic field are important also in other fields as high energy physics , atomic physics and astrophysics , as was pointed out in @xcite , which has attracted even more interest in the study of the iqhe .",
    "the coriolis force acts on a particle of mass @xmath4 very much like the magnetic force on a charged particle .",
    "this analogy has been explored by aharonov and carmi @xcite in the early 1970 s , by sakurai @xcite in 1980 and by tsai and neilson @xcite in 1988 in the context of a rotational quantum phase similar to aharanov - bohm s .",
    "the idea of rotation working as an effective magnetic field is in fact quite old . in 1915",
    "barnett @xcite already published a paper on magnetization by rotation which has recently had a renewed interest applied to nanostructures @xcite .",
    "a rotational analog of the classical hall effect has been proposed @xcite and the inertial effects of rotation in spintronics studied @xcite . based on the same analogy , dattoli and quattromini @xcite , introduced coriolis quantum states analogous to landau levels ( lls ) .",
    "this analogy also appears in the study of rapidly rotating bose - einstein condensates @xcite , for the hamiltonian describing a rotating gas in a harmonic trap is similar to that for charged particles in a magnetic field .",
    "the subject of analogue landau levels has been recently approached in the more general context of combined non - inertial , gravitational and electromagnetic effects by konno and takahashi @xcite who were interested on quantum states on the surface of a rotating star .",
    "the quantum hall effect under rotation has been discussed in more general grounds in @xcite .",
    "the coriolis force does not come alone .",
    "its companion , the centrifugal force , will be also felt by the particle in the rotating system .",
    "together , the coriolis and centrifugal contributions to the quantum hamiltonian lead only to a coupling between the particle angular momentum and the rotation , for the case of a spinless particle .",
    "this gives rise to non - degenerate , sample - length dependent , landau levels @xcite .",
    "neglecting the centrifugal part , besides this coupling , there appears the richer structure of rotational landau levels @xcite . on the other hand , if we are free from the centrifugal force we end up with a landau levels system that includes the coupling between the particle angular momentum and the rotation .",
    "it should be notice that , if a steady time variation of the rotation is assumed , then the euler force should be included in the analysis .",
    "the system of our interest consists in a non - interacting free electron gas in a rotating planar conductor with a uniform magnetic field applied perpendicular to the rotating plane .",
    "our purpose is to investigate the quantum hall effect in this system , analyzing the influence of the rotation in the hall conductivity .",
    "charged particles in a rotating hall sample were already studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was pointed out that the quantization of the hall conductivity is not affected by the rotation .",
    "however , as it will be shown here , the rotation breaks same degeneracy of the lls and the counting of states fully occupied bellow the fermi energy may change , altering the hall quantization steps .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we write out the hamiltonian of a charged particle in a rotating disk in the presence of a magnetic field and find the energy spectrum . in sec .",
    "3 we analyze the electronic structure , showing that the rotation induces a shift and a split in the landau levels . in sec . 4",
    "we investigate the influence of the rotation in the hall conductivity .",
    "the paper is summarized and concluded in sec .",
    "let us consider a free particle in a rotating disk with a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the disk [ see fig . [ disco ] ] .",
    "the coriolis and centrifugal forces are given by @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "these forces enter the schrdinger hamiltonian as a vector and scalar inertial potential @xcite given by @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , and the hamiltonian is written as @xmath9 a magnetic field @xmath10 applied in the laboratory will be felt by charged particles in the rotating reference frame as an electric and a magnetic field given by @xcite @xmath11 and @xmath12     direction.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ degenerecenciap=2 ]    therefore , the hamiltonian in cylindrical coordinates of a particle in a rotating disk in the presence of a magnetic field , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , can be written as @xmath15 ^ 2}{2m}-\\frac{m(\\vec{\\omega}\\times\\vec{r})^2}{2}+qv\\ ; , \\label{hamiltonianageral}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the scalar and vector electromagnetic potentials , and are given by @xmath18 thus , the hamiltonian can be summarized to @xmath19 with @xmath20 for this hamiltonian , the schrdinger equation can be written as @xmath21 with the _ ansatz _ @xmath22 , eq .",

    "writing @xmath26 and looking to the asymptotic limits when @xmath27 and @xmath28 , one can propose a solution of the form @xmath29 replacing it in eq .",
    "( [ eqemr ] ) , one gets @xmath30 \\frac{du}{d\\xi}+\\left [ \\frac{\\lambda}{4\\sigma}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(|l|+1 \\right ) \\right]u=0 \\ ; , \\label{hiperour}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that is a confluent hypergeometric equation , which has solution @xmath31 where a is a constant and @xmath32 is a confluent hypergeometric function , in this case , degenerate . in order to have a finite polynomial function ( the hypergeometric series has to be convergent in order to have a physical solution )",
    ", the condition @xmath33 has to be satisfied , where @xmath34 is a positive integer number . from this condition ,",
    "the discrete possibles values for the energy are given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "the wave function is @xmath37 one can notice that the values of @xmath10 and @xmath38 are arbitrary .",
    "therefore , one can adjust the rotation and the magnetic field for different values .    considering @xmath39 @xcite ,",
    "there is only the magnetic force acting and , therefore , we find the usual landau levels in ( [ energia1 ] ) , @xmath40    with @xmath41 , we have only inertial forces acting in the system .",
    "this was done in 1999 by b.l .",
    "jonhson @xcite , who showed that @xmath42 and @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the bessel function and the energy spectrum is obteined from the boundary conditions in the disk .",
    "one can find this result calculating the limit of the function ( [ fdeonda ] ) when @xmath45 , and extracting from the new wave function ( bessel ) , the new condition for the energy .",
    "it s important to note that one can not obtain the expression ( [ energiajohnson ] ) only substituting @xmath41 in our energy spectrum ( [ energia1 ] ) , because the energy must be obtained using the boundary conditions that is provided by the schrdinger equation .",
    "so , when we choose @xmath41 in the schrdinger equation , the bessel equation is obtained , no longer the hypergeometric equation .",
    "note that for @xmath46 , the resulting equation is hypergeometric , resulting in a landau - like spectrum that is independent of the edge of the sample .",
    "it is a consequence of the fact that a weak magnetic field is enough to confine the wave function , so the edge is not important .",
    "however , with @xmath41 , there are quantized non - degenerated energy levels that are influenced by the edge of the sample .",
    "before analyzing the electronic structure for a general case , let us first consider two special choices for the rotation and the magnetic field .",
    "the first case is @xmath47 , which represents a system that has only magnetic and coriolis forces , _",
    "i.e. _ , the electric and centrifugal forces vanish .",
    "the second one is @xmath48 , which represents the inverse .",
    "the magnetic and coriolis forces vanish , remaining only the electric and centrifugal forces .",
    "then , substituting these choices in eq .",
    "( [ energia ] ) , one can find that the energy levels are given by @xmath49 for the first case and @xmath50 for the second case , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "one can note that in the second case , even though with the vanishing of the magnetic force and without the vector potential appearing in the final hamiltonian , a landau - like quantization still exists .    ) for @xmath53 .",
    "all the levels with @xmath54 are degenerate , title=\"fig : \" ] [ degenerecenciap=2 ]    the states are degenerate in both cases .",
    "one can see this by analyzing the numbers @xmath55 and @xmath56 in eqs .",
    "( [ energyfirstcase ] ) and ( [ energysecondcase ] ) . in the first case ,",
    "different combinations between @xmath34 and @xmath57 give the same @xmath55 , which means the same energy .",
    "in particular , all states with @xmath58 for a given @xmath34 are degenerate [ see fig . [ e1 ] ] .",
    "this is what happens in the usual landau levels , except that in the lls for the same value of @xmath34 , the states are infinitely degenerated with @xmath59 .",
    "so , the result of the first case is the usual landau levels with reversed charge .",
    "it s important to note that the number @xmath55 is always integer for any combination between @xmath34 and @xmath57 . in the second case ,",
    "it is also possible to obtain different combinations between @xmath34 and @xmath57 resulting in the same value for @xmath56 .",
    "one can note that @xmath56 is integer or half - integer , which means that the energy gap between two levels will be @xmath60 [ see fig .",
    "all levels are infinitely degenerated too .",
    "then , in the second case the energy levels are equivalent to the ones of the harmonic oscillator .    ) for @xmath53 .",
    "the possible values for the energy are separated by @xmath61 , as in the harmonic oscillator.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ degenerecenciap=1 ]    in order to consider the general case one can relate the rotation and the magnetic field as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a real number .",
    "this expression cover all possible combinations between @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "one can see that the two special cases discussed previously represent @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "so , the energy levels can be written as @xmath68 which allows us to plot the energy spectrum as a function of @xmath63 , as done in figs .",
    "the red , green and blue lines represent states with @xmath69 respectively .",
    "each line represents a value of @xmath34 , and the lowest line is @xmath70 .",
    "as can be seen , the levels with positive angular momentum are shifted up when @xmath63 increase , while states with negative angular momentum are shifted down . the levels with null angular momentum do not change with @xmath63 .",
    "one can see that the states with @xmath71 and @xmath72 are symmetric with relation to @xmath67 , which explains the fact that the special case with @xmath66 is equivalent to the usual lls @xmath73 with reversed charge . in consequence of this symmetry",
    ", there are crossings between states with @xmath71 and @xmath72 at @xmath67 , which mean that they are degenerate .",
    "the crossings remain at other integer values of @xmath63 , but in these cases the degenerescence is between states with different values of @xmath34 . when @xmath63 is an even integer the levels with @xmath74 are degenerate with the states with @xmath72 and @xmath71 , which does not happen at an odd integer value of @xmath63 .",
    "there is no degenerescence among these states when @xmath63 is not an integer .",
    "therefore , as was discussed above , the rotation affects directly the landau levels , inducing a shift and a split of the states .",
    "the shift has no important physical consequences , however the split of the levels will affect , for instance , the quantum hall effect .",
    "this will be discussed in the next section .    ) for @xmath72 ( red ) , @xmath74 ( green ) and @xmath71 ( blue ) as a function of the parameter @xmath63 .",
    "each line represents a value of @xmath34 and the lowest line is @xmath70 .",
    "when @xmath63 increases , the energy levels with positive angular momentum are shifted up , states with negative angular momentum are shifted down and the levels with null angular momentum stay unmoved.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ energiaxrotacaozoom ]",
    "at zero temperature and considering that the fermi energy @xmath75 is in an energy gap , the hall conductivity can be written as @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the number of states below the fermi energy and @xmath78 is the area of the surface .",
    "the density of states is given by @xmath79 therefore , one can obtain @xmath77 , that is given by @xmath80 where @xmath34 is the number of fully occupied lls below @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the hall conductivity is @xmath81 one can notice that the hall conductivity obtained here has the same form as in the case without rotation , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , due to the break of the degeneracy of the lls induced by rotation , the number of states fully occupied below the fermi energy may change .",

    "[ hallb ] we plot the hall conductivity as a function of the magnetic field for @xmath39 and @xmath82 ghz .",
    "in fact , it is plotted @xmath85 , which is the number of fully occupied lls below @xmath75 , where @xmath86 .",
    "when the magnetic field increases , all states increase their energy and begin to cross the fermi level , creating the hall steps .",
    "it should be mentioned that we are considering only states with @xmath87 . in the case with @xmath39 , when the magnetic field increases , the next step is always wider than the previous one .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the distance between two subsequent landau levels increases with the magnetic field .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath84 , the next step is not necessarily wider than the previous one .",
    "it is due to the break of the degeneracy among states with different values of @xmath57 introduced by rotation .",
    "so , each step , in the case with @xmath39 , becomes three for @xmath84 .",

    "[ hallr ] . looking to the energy spectrum ( [ energia1 ] ) we see that when the rotation speed increases , states with positive values of @xmath57 are shifted up , while states with negative @xmath57 are shifted down .",
    "energy levels with null angular momentum do not change with the rotation .",
    "thus , changing the rotation there will be states crossing up and down the fermi energy , enabling different behaviors for the hall quantization steps . in fig .",
    "[ hallr ] we are considering only states with @xmath89 , as in the previous case .",
    "it is possible to see that the number of states fully occupied below the fermi energy can increase , decrease or oscillate when the rotation changes continuously .",

    "[ hallr ] means that the rotation is in an opposite direction with relation to the magnetic field .    at specific values of @xmath65",
    "there are a sharp drop in the conductivity , which are represented by the vertical lines in fig .",

    "it happens because for these values of @xmath65 the parameter @xmath63 is an integer and states with @xmath90 are degenerate , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ ea2 ] , which reduce the number of states below the fermi level .",
    "then , its possible to understand fig .",
    "6 looking with attention to fig .",
    "when the modulus of the rotation speed increases up to values around @xmath91 hz , the hall steps have a teeth - like aspect , independent of the direction of the rotation , which means that after an energy level crosses up ( down ) the fermi energy another level crosses it down ( up ) . for higher values of the modulus of the rotation speed",
    "the number of fully occupied levels below @xmath75 begins to increase , in contrast to the previous case , where the hall conductivity decreases when the magnetic field increases .",
    "it is important to say that for high values of the rotation speed our model is not valid , because here we are not considering relativistic effects .",
    "the velocity @xmath92 in the edge of the sample is given by @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the radius of the disk .",
    "so , in order to have no relativistic values of @xmath92 , the radius of the disk where our model in valid decreases when @xmath65 increases .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the influence of the rotation on the quantized hall conductivity . for this purpose , we considered a rotating non - interacting planar two - dimensinal electron gas with a perpendicular uniform magnetic field .",
    "we verified that the rotation breaks the degenerecence of the landau levels .",
    "however , when the relation @xmath95 is satisfied and @xmath63 is an integer , there are degenerate states .",
    "we analyzed the electronic structure for all possible values of the parameter @xmath63 and emphasized two special cases , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "it was shown that at @xmath66 the electronic structure is equivalent to the usual landau levels , but with reversed charge .",
    "whereas , at @xmath67 the energy levels are equivalent to the ones of a harmonic oscilator .",
    "we found the hall conductivity , which is the same as in the case without rotation , however , due to the split introduced by rotation , the counting of the states fully occupied below the fermi energy change . fixing the rotation speed and plotting the hall conductivity as a function of the magnetic field for states with @xmath69",
    ", we found that each hall step for the case with @xmath39 becomes three when @xmath84 , increasing the height of the hall quantization steps .",
    "additionally , we plotted the hall conductivity against the rotation at a fixed value of the magnetic field .",
    "it was shown that the hall conductivity oscillates when the rotation increases up to values around @xmath91 hz , for the values of the parameters chosen here .",
    "this happens because states with positive ( negative ) angular momentum are shifted up ( down ) when the rotation speed increases .",
    "as a perspective , one can analyze the influence of rotation in the quantum hall effect of novel materials such as graphene and topological insulators ."
