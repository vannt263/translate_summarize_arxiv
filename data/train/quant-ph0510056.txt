    "in the last years holonomic quantum computation ( hqc ) has proved to be a viable and promising approach to quantum information processing and quantum computation  @xcite . according to this approach",

    ", concrete proposals for quantum computation have been put forward , for both abelian @xcite and non - abelian holonomies @xcite .",
    "the so - constructed gates depends only on global geometrical feature , e.g. , the solid angle spanned in the parameter space , and because of this , it is believed that they are robust against errors affecting the physical parameters controlling the gates themselves ( e.g. , laser pulses ) .",
    "this expectation has been confirmed by recent investigations   @xcite .",
    "an important open problem is whether holonomic quantum gates are stable under the effect of the environment @xcite . in this paper",
    "we argue that holonomic gates have indeed a good performance when the effect of the environment is taken into account .",
    "we show this on the basis of a simple and idealized model which covers situations describing electron states in quantum dots ranging from excitons @xcite to optically active spin - degenerate ones @xcite ( for a related investigation about environmental effects on semiconductor based quantum gates see ref .",

    "we show that analogous minimization can not be done with other kinds of environment ( _ ohmic _ ) .",
    "the physical system we consider is constituted by three degenerate ( or quasi - degenerate ) states ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 ) optically connected to another state @xmath4 . every degenerate state is separately addressed by polarization or frequency selection with a laser .",
    "this model describes various quantum systems interacting with a laser radiation field ; here , we deal with quantum states in semiconductor quantum dots such as excitons @xcite and spin - degenerate electron states @xcite .",
    "the ( approximate ) hamiltonian modeling the effect of the laser on the system is ( for simplicity , @xmath5 ) @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the time dependent rabi frequencies depending on controllable parameters , such as the phase and intensity of the lasers , and @xmath8 is the energy of the degenerate electron states .",
    "the rabi frequencies can be modulated within the adiabatic time @xmath9 ( which coincides with the gating time ) to produce a loop in the parameter space and thereby realize the periodic condition @xmath10 .",

    "in fact , for @xmath94 the gaussian cut - off with @xmath95 produces negligible rates , and for degenerate dark state ( @xmath96 ) the rates vanish .",
    "these considerations , together with the explicit form of the rates given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rates ] ) provide a compelling explanation of the temperature behavior of the fidelity in fig.[fig : single_qubit ] .",
    "moreover , we have found that the numerical results are fitted by means of the function @xmath97 ( where @xmath98 are two real parameters ) .",
    "this behavior is also manifest by considering the fidelity as a function of the coupling parameter @xmath17 ( see inset in fig . [",
    "fig : single_qubit ] ) . a similar dependence of the fidelity on the transition rate has been found in ref .",
    "note that in that case the authors have only a single transition process ( absorption to higher states or emission to lower states ) while we need to take into account both absorption and emission processes for the transition to the higher state .",
    "this is due to the different master equation solved .",
    "in fact , they solve a strictly second order master equation , while our eq .",
    "( [ eq : master_eq ] ) is `` self - consistent '' .",
    "the similarity in the results is derived from the small value of the coupling constant @xmath17 but for higher values the two approximations diverge from each other and the numerical results can not be fitted by such an elementary function .",
    "( [ eq : universal_fidelity ] ) is particularly important in that it allows one to predict how the fidelity behaves when the parameters of the system are modified . to this end , first of all note that , by keeping the adiabatic parameter constant ( @xmath99 const ) , the rates @xmath100 become a non - trivial function of the adiabatic time .",
    "then , by writing the rates explicitly , one obtains @xmath101 .",
    "thus , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fidelity ] ) that the fidelity should have a pronounced minimum as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "this behavior is confirmed by the computer simulations presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fid_ad ] . by varying @xmath32 and @xmath9 ( e.g. , by acting on the lasers ) the position of the fidelity minimum in fig .",
    "[ fig : fid_ad ] can be shifted and the effect of _ superohmic _ environment can be suppressed .",
    "it seems to us that this is an interesting result .    before discussing the limitations of this result",
    ", we would like to comment on the approximations upon which our analysis relies . as we have already anticipated , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : master_eq ] ) the markov approximation is appropriate when the memory time @xmath58 is small with respect to the time scale of variation of the density matrix @xmath59 .",
    "( [ eq : autocorrelation ] ) leads to the estimate @xmath102 ; while eq .",
    "( [ eq : rates ] ) , for a _ superohmic _ spectral density and @xmath103 , leads to @xmath104 .",
    "note that the conditions of validity of the markov approximation , @xmath105 , readily translate into a temperature regime , namely @xmath106 . with our choice of parameters",
    ", we have @xmath107 ( depending on @xmath17 value ) , which , in our simulations , is a very low temperature .",
    "since the possibility of suppressing the _ superohmic _ effects is indeed surprising , one may wonder whether a similar possibility arises for more general environments , e.g. for ohmic environments .",
    "though ohmic environments are typical of baths of conduction electrons @xcite , even for phonon baths , which are typically _ superohmic _ , it seems possible that the spectral density contains an ohmic part ; this is presumably due to higher order contributions such as two phonon processes @xcite .",
    "be that as it may , we found it interesting to extend our analysis to an environment with the spectral density @xmath108 with @xmath109",
    ". as is easily seen , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rates ] ) for ohmic rates leads to completely different results .",
    "this is due to the presence , in the ohmic case , of transitions between degenerate states which are absent in the case of a superhomic environment .",
    "this difference has striking consequences : the transitions between degenerate states give contribution to the rates ( [ eq : rates ] ) which are linear in @xmath39 ( while the transitions between non - degenerate states have the same temperature behavior as the _ superohmic _ case ) . this difference is confirmed by the computer simulations in fig .",
    "[ fig : ohmic ] , which shows the fidelity for the superohmic and ohmic environments , and the sum of the two contributions as a function of @xmath39 .",
    "this curve clearly shows that the presence of an ohmic environment changes dramatically the fidelity behavior , whence it follows the impossibility of extending to the ohmic case the results previously obtained changing the adiabatic time .",
    "this conclusion becomes very clear if one compares fig .",
    "[ fig : fid_ad ] with the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : ohmic ] .",
    "it is not possible anymore to optimize the fidelity by changing the parameters .    before concluding , we briefly mention three points ( see @xcite for a thorough discussion ) .",
    "first , the computer simulation for gate @xmath12 confirms the results found for gate @xmath11 .",
    "second , our analysis extends ( almost straightforwardly ) to the two - qubit gate proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite : fig .",
    "[ fig:2qubs ] shows the preliminary results for the two - qubit gate ( for a non random initial state ) as a function of temperature and coupling constant for _ superohmic _ and _ ohmic _ environments ; the behavior of the fidelity is analogous to that of the one qubit case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ohmic ] ) .",
    "third , for the ohmic case , a careful study of the ( relatively ) high temperature behavior shows the limitations of the lindblad approximation for the reduced dynamics .",
    "to sum up , the upshot of our analysis is twofold .",
    "the good news is that it is possible to optimize the fidelity for the kind of environment which is usually considered for electron states in quantum dots|a superohmic environment caused by electron - phonon interactions .",
    "the bad news is that such optimization does not go through an ohmic environment , e.g. , produced by the _",
    "same _ superohmic phonon bath through two phonon processes .",
    "thus , particular attention should be paid in modeling the environment , since the presence of a weak ohmic environment dramatically changes the holonomic gate performance . for these reasons",
    "it is crucial to dispose of experimental investigations on the nature of the environmental spectral densities in semiconductor quantum dots .",
