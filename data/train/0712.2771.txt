    "the construction of an efficient portfolio aims at maximising the investor s capital , or its return , while minimising the risk of unfavourable events .",
    "this problem has been pioneered by markowitz in  @xcite , where the mean - variance ( m - v ) efficient portfolio has been introduced : it minimizes the portfolio variance for any fixed value of its expected return .",
    "since this rule can be only justified under somewhat unrealistic assumptions ( namely a quadratic utility function or a normal distribution of returns , in addition to risk aversion ) , it should be considered as a first approximation of the optimisation process .",
    "later , several optimisation schemes inspired by markowitz s work have been proposed  @xcite . for a recent thorough overview of the portfolio theory see  @xcite .",
    "a different perspective has been put forward by kelly in  @xcite , where he shows that the optimal strategy for the long run can be found by maximising the expected value of the logarithm of the wealth after one time step .",
    "the optimality of this strategy has long been treated and proven in many different ways  @xcite , according to  @xcite , it was successfully used in real financial markets . for",
    "an overview of its continuous time limit see  @xcite .",
    "recently , the superiority of typical outcomes to average values has been discussed from a  different point of view in  @xcite .",
    "although the kelly criterion does not employ a utility function , as pointed out by the author himself , a number of economists have adopted the point of view of utility theory to evaluate it  @xcite .",
    "various modifications , such as fractional kelly strategies  @xcite and controlled drawdowns  @xcite , have been proposed to increase security of the resulting portfolios .",
    "a thorough review of the advantages , drawbacks and modifications of the kelly criterion is presented in  @xcite . for an exposition of the kelly approach in the context of information theory see  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall discuss the original kelly strategy in the framework of a simple stochastic model and without assuming the existence of a utility function .",
    "we will present approximate analytical results for optimal portfolios in various situations , as well as numerical solutions and computer simulations .",
    "we will show that , in the limit of small returns and volatilities , when there is no risk - free asset , the kelly - optimal portfolio lies on the efficient frontier .",
    "furthermore , we shall analytically study the conditions under which diversification is no longer profitable and the optimal portfolio `` condensates '' on a few assets . such condensation ( or underdiversification ) is said to be typical for the kelly portfolio  @xcite and here we examine it in various model scenarios .",
    "finally , we will consider the fluctuations of the logarithm of wealth as a measure of risk , and compare it with the classic m - v picture .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . after introducing a multiplicative stochastic model for the dynamics of assets prices",
    ", we briefly list the main results of the markowitz mean - variance approach . in sec .",
    "[ gm ] , we apply kelly s method to our model , analysing the case of one , two and many risky assets , both with and without additional constraints . finally , a combination of the markowitz efficient frontier with the kelly strategy is investigated . in the appendix",
    "we explain the approximations used in this paper as well as a  generalisation of the model to the case of correlated asset prices .",
    "we shall study the portfolio optimisation on a very simple model which leads to lognormally distributed returns .",
    "consider @xmath0 assets , whose prices @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) undergo uncorrelated multiplicative random walks @xmath3 here the random numbers @xmath4 are drawn from gaussian density distributions of fixed mean @xmath5 and variance @xmath6 , and are independent of their value at previous time steps .",
    "this model can be easily generalised to the case of non - gaussian densities and correlated price variations as it is discussed in appendix  [ app2 ] ; the influence of correlations on the kelly portfolio is investigated in  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the investor knows exact values of the parameters @xmath7for the effects of wrong parameter estimates and the details of the bayesian parameter - learning process see _ e.g. _  @xcite .",
    "we further assume the existence of a risk - free asset paying zero interest rate .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we do not include dividends , transaction costs and taxes in the model .",
    "hence , the return of asset @xmath8 is @xmath9/p_i({t-1})= { \\mathrm{e}}^{\\eta_i(t)}-1 $ ] is lognormally distributed with the average @xmath10 - 1 $ ] and the volatility @xmath11 - 1)\\exp[2m_i+d_i]$ ] . with @xmath12",
    "we denote averages over the noise @xmath4 .",
    "a portfolio is determined by the fractions @xmath13 of the total capital invested in each one of @xmath0 available assets ; the rest is kept in the  risk - free asset . since @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    "are fixed , both the kelly strategy and the efficient frontier use one time step optimisation and the basic quantity is the wealth after one time step @xmath14 .",
    "if we set the initial wealth to 1 , @xmath14 has the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the portfolio return . to simplify the computation we assume infinite divisibility of the investment .",
    "thus , the investment fractions @xmath13 are real numbers and do not need to be rounded .    in the portfolio optimisation ,",
    "some common constraints are often imposed and can as well be applied in the present context . for instance",
    ", the non - negativity of the investment fractions @xmath17 forbids short positions .",
    "the condition @xmath18 indicates the absence of a riskless asset and @xmath19 does not allow the investor to borrow money .",
    "the unconstrained maximisation of the expected capital gain results in the investment of the entire wealth on the asset with the highest expected return ; this strategy is sometimes referred to as risk neutral . if the investor has a strong aversion to risk , on the other hand , one might be tempted to simply minimise the portfolio variance @xmath20 .",
    "this leads to invest the entire capital on the risk - free asset with no chance to benefit from asset price movements .",
    "the mean - variance ( mv ) approach is much more reasonable as it allows to compromise between the gain and the risk . here",
    "we recount basic results of this standard tool .    with the desired expected return fixed at @xmath21 , the constrained minimisation of the portfolio variance @xmath22",
    "is performed using the lagrange function @xmath23 with a lagrange multiplier @xmath24 .",
    "the resulting optimal fractions are @xmath25 for @xmath26 , @xmath27 for all assets .",
    "as we increase @xmath28 , all optimal fractions @xmath29 grow in a uniform way and their ratios are preserved . at some value @xmath30 we reach @xmath31 , which means we are investing the entire capital .",
    "any further increase would require to borrow money , with eq .",
    "( [ mv - q ] ) remaining valid as long as the borrowing rate equals the lending rate ( both set to zero here ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath32 and @xmath28 is @xmath33 this equation is often referred to as capital market line ( cml ) .     versus the standard deviation of the portfolio @xmath32 .",
    "the assets are described by the following parameters : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( in the graph they are shown as full circles ) .",
    "the dashed line represents the cml from eq .",
    "( [ mv - var ] ) , the solid line is efficient frontier given by eq .",
    "( [ mv - ef ] ) , the tangent point of the two is the market portfolio .",
    "the thick part of ef marks the region where all investment fractions are positive . ]",
    "if there is no risk - free asset in the market , one has to introduce the additional constraint @xmath40 .",
    "it follows that @xmath41 the functional relation between the optimised @xmath32 and @xmath28 is called efficient frontier ( ef ) . since there is only one point on the cml where @xmath42 , this line is tangent to the ef .",
    "the results of this section are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig - ef ] for a particular choice of three available assets .",
    "when the investor s capital follows a multiplicative process , after many time steps is its expected value strongly influenced by rare events and in consequence it is not reasonable to form a  portfolio by simply maximising @xmath43 .",
    "the mean - variance approach tries to solve this problem in a straightforward , yet criticisable way .",
    "we support here the idea that an efficient investment strategy can be found by maximising the investment growth rate in the long run , which is , under the assumption of fixed asset properties , equivalent to maximising the logarithm of the wealth @xmath14 after one time step  @xcite .",
    "thus the key quantity in the construction of a kelly - optimal portfolio is @xmath44 , the average exponential growth rate of the wealth .",
    "we remind that the quantity @xmath45 is not a  logarithmic utility function .    in  @xcite , @xmath46 is optimised in a similar context and the authors claim that their procedure corresponds to maximising the median of the distribution of returns .",
    "they consider short time intervals and thus small assets returns . assuming @xmath47 ( very small portfolio return )",
    ", they use the approximation @xmath48 of the logarithm in the expression of @xmath46 before maximising it .",
    "however , while such an expansion is only justified for @xmath47 , the maximum of the resulting function is at @xmath49 , in contradiction with the hypothesis .",
    "we will develop a  different approximation in the following .",
    "first , the unconstrained maximisation of @xmath46 is achieved by solving the set of equations @xmath50 ( @xmath2 ) . after exchanging the order of the derivative and the average",
    ", we obtain the condition @xmath51 in our case , @xmath52 has a lognormal distribution and to our knowledge , this set of equations can not be solved analytically . with the help of the approximations introduced in the appendix",
    "we shall work out approximative solutions for some particular cases .",
    "we emphasize an important restriction which applies to all solutions of eq .",
    "( [ max - condition ] ) . since",
    "returns @xmath52 lie in the range @xmath53 , when @xmath54 or when there is an investment fraction @xmath55 , there is a  nonzero probability that @xmath14 is negative and hence @xmath56 is not well defined .",
    "since kelly s approach focuses on the long run , it requires strictly zero probability of getting bankrupted in one turn . as a consequence , for lognormally distributed returns any kelly strategy must obey @xmath57 and @xmath58 , i.e. both short selling and borrowing",
    "must be avoided .",
    "let us begin the reasoning with the case of one risky asset .",
    "we want to find the optimal investment fraction @xmath59 of the available wealth .",
    "the remaining fraction @xmath60 we keep in cash at the risk - free interest rate which , without loss of generality , is set to zero .",
    "this problem is described by eq .",
    "( [ max - condition ] ) in one dimension ; even this simplest case has no analytical solution .",
    "nevertheless , for a given @xmath61 , one can ask what is the value @xmath62 for which it becomes profitable to invest a positive fraction of the investor s capital in the risky asset .",
    "this can be found imposing @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ max - condition ] ) , yielding @xmath64 .",
    "similarly , the value @xmath65 for which it becomes profitable to invest the entire capital can be found by imposing @xmath66 , yielding @xmath67 .",
    "we shall look for approximate solutions that are valid for small values of @xmath61 , which is the case treated in appendix  [ app1 ] . using approximation eq .",
    "( [ approximation ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ max - condition ] ) gives @xmath68 with respect to @xmath59 , this is merely a quadratic equation .",

    "also , eq .  ( [ q - analytical ] ) is for @xmath83 identical to the classical merton s result  @xcite which is derived under the assumption of continuous - time , non - zero consumption of the wealth , and a logarithmic utility function . in  @xcite",
    ", the result @xmath90 is derived for the continuous time limit of our model : @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "the optimal portfolio fractions @xmath13 can be derived from eq .",
    "( [ max - condition ] ) also for @xmath93 . using the same approximations as in the single asset case ,",
    "we obtain the general formula @xmath94 for @xmath2 . in our case , kelly s approach forbids short selling and hence the assets with @xmath95 do not enter the optimal portfolio . since borrowing is also forbidden , if @xmath96 , we have to introduce the additional constraint @xmath18 .",
    "this can be done by use of the lagrange function @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the vector of investment fractions .",
    "the optimal portfolio is then the solution of the set of equations @xmath99 where @xmath100 . using the same approximations again",

    "this phenomenon , which we call portfolio condensation , we study closer in sections  [ tca ] and [ tcb ] . an alternative approach to the constrained kelly - optimal portfolio is provided by the kuhn - tucker equations ( see  @xcite ) which , however , can be shown to be equivalent to  eq .",
