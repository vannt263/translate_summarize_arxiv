    "quantum antiferromagnets have been a fertile field of research for a half century , exhibiting a great richness and variety of physical phenomena . in more recent decades , starting with anderson s introduction of the rvb state @xcite and accelerating with the discovery of the cuprate superconductors @xcite , much attention has focused on antiferromagnets that allow for disordered ground states due to a mix of frustration and quantum fluctuations @xcite . in an important step , affleck _ et .",
    "@xcite showed how to construct models that build in a great deal of both these effects by using local projectors - models for which ( essentially unique ) ground states can be determined analytically .",
    "these aklt models have spins given by @xmath9 , where @xmath1 is any integer , and @xmath10 the lattice coordination number .",
    "the associated ground states have the added feature that their wavefunctions can be written in jastrow ( pair product ) form .",
    "a general feature of such wavefunctions is that the ground - state probability densities can be viewed as boltzmann weights corresponding to a local , indeed nearest neighbor , hamiltonian for classical spins on the same lattice . using this unusual quantum - classical equivalence",
    "we can understand many properties of the states via monte carlo simulations of the associated classical model .    in @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    ", the aklt states are disordered for _ any _ spin due to the hohenberg - mermin - wagner theorem .",
    "in particular , the @xmath4 case is the celebrated aklt chain which realizes the @xmath11 haldane phase . in this paper",
    ", we study aklt states in @xmath6 , which are relatively less well - understood than their one and two dimensional counterparts .",
    "moreover , in three dimensions , the hohenberg - mermin - wagner theorem no longer applies and therefore whether an aklt state of a given spin is disordered or instead exhibits long range order is no longer automatic . instead a computation is now required to settle this question and it is this issue that we address in this paper by a combination of mean - field arguments and monte carlo simulation .",
    "specifically , we discuss the aklt states on the simple cubic and diamond lattices , where there is no ( geometrical ) frustration , as well on the highly frustrated pyrochlore lattice , where the attendant complications lead to a macroscopic ground state degeneracy of the associated classical model .",
    "of course , all the models we study have frustration from competing interactions .    on the cubic lattice",
    "we find that all aklt states starting with the `` minimal '' ( smallest spin ) @xmath8 state are ordered with the standard two sublattice nel pattern .",
    "the diamond lattice has a small coordination number and thus larger fluctuations and we find that on it the the minimal @xmath7 state is disordered while all higher spin states are ordered with the two sublattice nel pattern . on the pyrochlore lattice ,",
    "the geometrical frustration of the lattice plays a significant role . in mean field theory for the companion classical model",
    "we find a macroscopic number of solutions corresponding to as many energy minima . while the mean field estimate for the critical spin ( transition temperature ) already indicates that the minimal @xmath8 model on the pyrochlore lattice is disordered",
    ", the large number of competing states indicate that the true boundary between disorder and some form of order lies at much larger values of spin .",
    "indeed , a basic simulation leads to a conservative bound in which disordered ground states persist up to @xmath12 .",
    "given the unphysical complexity of the aklt hamiltonians at such large spins we do not pursue a more precise determination of this boundary in this work .",
    "indeed , readers may take as the main fruits of our work the identification of the @xmath7 aklt model on the diamond lattice and the @xmath8 aklt model on the pyrochlore lattice as ( not too common ) instances of three dimensional spin hamiltonians with quantum disordered ground states .",
    "it is worth noting that models with quantum disordered ground states are currently objects of intense interest in the context of topological order and more specifically , in the context of topological quantum computing .",
    "we note that our disordered models do _ not _ yield topologically ordered states ; they do not posess a topological degeneracy or host fractionalized excitations .",
    "the disordered states herein are described either as fully symmetric valence bond solids or , in the long wavelength sense , as quantum paramagnets . to understand why this is the case",
    ", it is instructive to recall how a closely related strategy works to produce topologically ordered states in @xmath13 models , including instances in @xmath6 .",
    "this strategy , initiated by chayes , chayes and kivelson @xcite , and brought to fruition in work by raman , moessner and sondhi @xcite works with spin-@xmath14 analogs of the aklt models called klein models @xcite .",
    "unlike aklt models , klein models have many ground states  indeed they select the macroscopically many nearest neighbor valence bond coverings of a lattice .",
    "this selection of a degenerate manifold underlies the emergence of topological order .",
    "more precisely , the work of rms showed that klein models could be controllably perturbed on a family of lattices in order to select a topologically ordered ( rvb ) state in this ground state manifold .",
    "in this fashion they could construct @xmath15 symmetric models with @xmath16 topological order in @xmath5 but also models with @xmath16 and @xmath17 order in @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we present a brief summary of the aklt construction .",
    "we then proceed in section iii to review the mean field analysis of the aklt states @xcite .",
    "we then specialize in section iv to bipartite lattices , and compute the transition temperature for the simple cubic and diamond lattices using monte carlo simulations .",
    "we determine that while the simple cubic lattice exhibits nel order for all choices of @xmath1 ( and thus @xmath0 ) , the diamond lattice allows a quantum disordered state in the @xmath18 ( @xmath7 ) case .",
    "we then go on to discuss the aklt states on the frustrated 3d pyrochlore lattice , and discuss the mean field analysis and classical ground states in this case .",
    "we find that the pyrochlore lattice admits quantum disordered states for many values of @xmath1 ; while the exact value of @xmath19 was not determined , we find evidence from simulations that it exceeds @xmath20 , corresponding to @xmath12 .",
    "the central idea of the aklt approach @xcite , is to use the idea of quantum singlets to construct correlated quantum - disordered wavefunctions , which are eigenstates of local projection operators .",
    "one can then produce many - body hamiltonians using projectors that extinguish the state , thereby rendering the parent wavefunction an exact ground state , typically with a gap to low - lying excitations .",
    "a general member of the family of valence bond solid ( aklt ) states can be written compactly in terms of schwinger bosons @xcite : @xmath21 this assigns @xmath1 singlet creation operators to each link @xmath22 of a lattice @xmath23 .",
    "the total boson occupancy per site is given by @xmath24 , where @xmath10 is the lattice coordination number , and the resultant spin on each site is given by @xmath25 .",
    "thus , given any lattice , the above construction defines a family of aklt states with @xmath25 , where @xmath1 is any integer .",
    "the maximum possible spin on any link is then @xmath26 , and therefore @xmath27 is extinguished by any hamiltonian constructed out of projectors @xmath28 onto link spin @xmath29 , provided @xmath30 .",
    "the projectors , which transform as @xmath15 singlets , may be written as polynomials in the heisenberg coupling @xmath31 of order @xmath32 .",
    "explicitly , one has @xmath33",
    "the aklt states have a convenient representation in terms of @xmath15 coherent states , as first shown in ref .  .",
    "in terms of the schwinger bosons , the normalized spin-@xmath0 coherent state is given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , with @xmath36 a @xmath37 spinor , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the unit vector @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 are the pauli matrices .",
    "in the coherent state representation , the general aklt state wavefunction is the pair product @xmath43 .",
    "following ref .  , we may write @xmath44 as the boltzmann weight for a classical @xmath2 model with hamiltonian @xmath45 at temperature @xmath3 .",
    "all equal time quantum correlations in the state @xmath46 may then be expressed as classical , finite temperature correlations of the hamiltonian @xmath47 .    the consequences of this quantum - to - classical equivalence , which is a general feature of jastrow ( pair product ) wavefunctions ,",
    "were noted in ref .  . on one and two - dimensional lattices",
    ", the hohenberg - mermin - wagner theorem precludes long - ranged order at any finite value of the discrete quantum parameter @xmath1 .",
    "thus , while the @xmath7 heisenberg model on the square lattice is rigorously known to have a nel ordered ground state @xcite , the @xmath7 aklt hamiltonian , which includes up to biquartic terms , has a featureless quantum disordered ground state , called a ` quantum paramagnet ' . in three dimensions ,",
    "we expect nel order for large @xmath1 , corresponding to low temperatures in the classical model . if the nel temperature for @xmath47 on a given lattice satisfies @xmath48 , then @xmath49 , and all the allowed aklt states on that lattice exhibit long - ranged order .",
    "the issue of whether or not the aklt states can be in the quantum disordered phase on a given lattice can be investigated by a combination of mean - field calculations and classical monte carlo simulations , which we present below .",
    "a mean field analysis of the classical model of eqn . [ hcl ] on bipartite lattices was described in refs .  .",
    "in the general case , we may begin with the hamiltonian of eqn .",
    "[ hcl ] , and we write @xmath50 , with @xmath51 . expanding @xmath52 to order @xmath53 , we obtain the mean field hamiltonian @xmath54 , where the mean field @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 where the prime restricts the sum on @xmath57 to nearest neighbors of site @xmath58 .",
    "self - consistency then requires @xmath59 which yields @xmath60 , with local magnetization @xmath61",
    "on an unfrustrated , bipartite , lattice a sublattice rotation @xmath62 , with @xmath63 on the a ( b ) sublattice , results in a ferromagnetic interaction , and if we posit a uniform local magnetization @xmath64 we obtain the mean field @xmath65 where @xmath10 is the lattice coordination number .",
    "this results in a mean field transition temperature @xmath66 , _ i.e. _ @xmath67 .",
    "all aklt states on bipartite lattices in more than two space dimensions will exhibit two sublattice nel order , provided @xmath68 . according to the mean field analysis",
    ", long ranged order should pertain for @xmath69 , which would be satisfied by almost any three - dimensional structure .",
    "however , mean field theory ignores fluctuations , hence it overestimates @xmath70 and underestimates @xmath71 .",
    "therefore the possibility remains that a quantum disordered aklt state may exist in a three - dimensional lattice .",
    "we examine two cases , the simple cubic lattice ( @xmath72 ) and the diamond lattice ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "we shall address this issue via classical monte carlo simulations of our model on both lattices .",
    "we note that , of these , the diamond lattice is the stronger candidate as it is more weakly coordinated , and @xmath74 is sufficiently close to threshold that fluctuations are likely to drive the true @xmath71 to be greater than unity .",
    "the classical hamiltonian @xmath47 of eqn .",
    "[ hcl ] consists of nearest neighbor interactions @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the relative angle between spins on neighboring sites @xmath58 and @xmath57 , and @xmath77 .",
    "this interaction strongly suppresses ferromagnetic alignment , with a logarithmically infinite barrier , but has a smooth quadratic minimum @xmath78 when @xmath79 .",
    "we have simulated the equivalent ferromagnetic model , with interaction @xmath80 .",
    "we used a multithread monte carlo approach , in which simultaneous simulations with independent initial configurations were used to produce @xmath1 independent markov chains each with @xmath81 configurations @xcite , which were then written to a file . for every independent thread",
    ", we performed checkerboard sweeps of the lattice using a standard metropolis monte carlo technique @xcite . in each monte carlo step , we produced a vector @xmath82 , with length distributed according to a gaussian and pointing in a random direction , which was used to generate a new spin unit vector @xmath83 the standard deviation of the gaussian was adjusted by hand until a significant fraction of proposed moves were accepted ( we left it at @xmath84 . )    the number of monte carlo steps per site ( mcs ) and the number of independent threads were adjusted to count roughly the same number of autocorrelation times for each sample size@xcite . for each chain",
    ", we obtained the average value of the binder cumulant , and averaged this across chains to get a single number for each temperature .",
    "we estimated the error from the standard deviation of the @xmath1 _ independent _ thread averages .",
    "this is free of the usual complications of correlated samples inherent in estimating the error from a single chain , and frees us of the need to compute autocorrelation times to weight our error estimate .",
    "plots were made of the binder cumulant @xcite , defined to be @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the total magnetization .    for any system of heisenberg spins in the thermodynamic limit , the binder cumulant has value @xmath87 in the low - temperature ( ordered ) phase and value @xmath88 in the high - temperature phase .",
    "these are easily seen by assuming a gaussian distribution for @xmath89 at high temperature , and using the result that all the expectation values of powers of @xmath90 are equal in the ordered phase . for a finite system ,",
    "the limiting values continue to be close to these estimates , but the interpolating behavior is different for each system size ; the primary utility from our point of view is that finite - size scaling analysis of @xmath91 reveals that it has a fixed point at the transition temperature @xcite .",
    "we may therefore determine @xmath92 by plotting the binder cumulant for a series of different lattice sizes , and determining the points where the curves cross .    before simulating our modified interaction",
    ", we checked our code by determining the ( known ) transition temperatures for the standard heisenberg model on the simple cubic lattice @xcite and the ising model on both the diamond and the simple cubic lattices @xcite , as well as comparing the high - temperature susceptibility from simulations to the predictions of the high - temperature expansion @xcite .",
    "all these agreed well with the expected values , at least to the accuracy we need to determine whether @xmath92 is less than or greater than @xmath93 . recall that if @xmath94 , then @xmath95 , which means that the minimal aklt state , with @xmath18 , is on the disordered side of the phase transition .    using our monte carlo simulations , we obtain estimates of @xmath92 for the families of aklt states on the simple cubic and diamond lattices . although our simulation techniques were not particularly sophisticated , they were sufficient to pin down @xmath92 to a reasonable degree of accuracy , and certainly enough to determine whether @xmath96 .",
    "our simulations allow us to estimate that @xmath97 on the simple cubic lattice , and that @xmath98 for the diamond structure .",
    "therefore , we conclude that while all the simple cubic aklt states are nel - ordered , the minimal ( @xmath7 ) aklt state in diamond is a featureless quantum disordered state .",

    "the pyrochlore is a lattice of corner - sharing tetrahedra and can be constructed from the the diamond lattice by placing a site at the midpoint of each bond , resulting in a quadripartite structure .",
    "the pyrochlore lattice is highly frustrated from the perspective of of collinear antiferromagnetism ; the canonical nearest - neighbor classical heisenberg antiferromagnet on this lattice has an extensive ground - state degeneracy and remains a quantum paramagnet at all temperatures @xcite .",
    "our problem has a different form for the interaction and hence the results for the nearest neighbor problem , which build on the high degree of degeneracy for a single tetrahedron , do not apply .",
    "indeed , as we discuss below , the logarithmic form of the interaction energy leads to the selection of a unique single - tetrahedron ground state up to global rotations .",
    "however , the full lattice still exhibits a substantial ground state degeneracy on account of its open architecture indicating an anomalously low transition temperature which we roughly bound from above by @xmath104 .",
    "we now turn to the details of these assertions .",
    "numerical minimization on a single tetrahedron finds the lowest - energy configuration to be one where each pair of spins make an angle @xmath105 .",
    "this means that the spins are pointing either towards or away from the corners of a regular tetrahedron in three - dimensional spin space .",
    "we proceed to search for soft modes , by expanding the energy to quadratic order and studying the resulting normal modes .",
    "we find that there is a pair of soft modes corresponding to global rotations , and another where three spins rotate about the axis defined by the fourth .",
    "the latter mode leads to a degeneracy of ground states of the full lattice as discussed below .",
    "we note that for the heisenberg antiferromagnet with interaction @xmath106 , the single tetrahedron hamiltonian is @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is a sum of the spin vectors over all sites in the tetrahedron @xmath109 .",
    "the ground state manifold @xmath110 is then five - dimensional , since one can choose any two vectors @xmath111 and @xmath112 , then take @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the four freedoms associated with choosing @xmath111 and @xmath112 are then augmented by another freedom to rotate the @xmath115 and @xmath116 spins about the direction @xmath117 .",
    "a large-@xmath81 analysis@xcite finds that the @xmath118 pyrochlore antiferromagnet is paramagnetic down to @xmath119 .",
    "there are many ways in which we can construct degenerate states on the lattice that simultaneously satisfy the minimum - energy constraint on every tetrahedron .",
    "we begin by describing the simplest such states which form a discrete family . to this end ,",
    "label the four spins defined by the single - tetrahedron constraint ( with a fixed joint orientation ) as @xmath120 , @xmath91 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "if we use only these four orientations for each spin , we have the constraint that none of them can occur twice on the same tetrahedron ; this translates to the statement that spins on neighboring links must be different .",
    "this is the same constraint as for ground states of the antiferromagnetic 4-state potts model .",
    "we therefore conclude that one family of ground states of the classical hamiltonian on the pyrochlore lattice are in a one - to - one correspondence with the ground states of the 4-state potts antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "readers familiar with the lore on the kagom problem@xcite will recognize the resemblance to the planar ground states there which are in correspondence to ground states of the 3-state potts model . as in the kagom problem , from this set of ground states others can be constructed by identifying sets of spins which can be locally rotated by an arbitrary amount at zero energy cost .",
    "these are sets of spins , say of type @xmath91 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 which are connected to other spins solely by spins of type @xmath120 .",
    "clearly one can rotate this set by an angle about the @xmath120 axis at zero energy cost .",
    "while we have not parametrized the full , continuous , space of ground states an extensive lower bound on the degeneracy of the ` potts submanifold ' of ground states can be obtained as follows .",
    "first , we note that the number of allowed configurations of the 3-state potts model on a kagom lattice with @xmath1 sites is given @xcite by @xmath121 .",
    "next we partition the pyrochlore into four sublattices , so that the sites that lie on a single tetrahedron are each on different sublattices .",
    "choose one sublattice , and fix the spins on that sublattice to be one of the four types ( say a. ) now , looking down through the tetrahedra , one sees alternating layers of triangular and kagom planes ; the kagom planes are made up of b , c , and d spins , while the triangular planes are made up of a spins . in each kagom plane , we have @xmath1 spins , whose configurations are those of the @xmath122-state potts model . if we now let @xmath123 be the number of kagom planes , we must have that @xmath124 , where @xmath81 is the total number of spins in the system .",
    "we then have for the number of states in this restricted submanifold @xmath125 where the factor of @xmath126 stems from the fact that we can choose any one of the four spins to be fixed in the triangular planes .",
    "since we ve restricted ourselves to considering a certain submanifold of the ground states in the above argument , it is clear that we have obtained a lower bound for the degeneracy of the potts submanifold .",
    "each of the ground states identified above can serve as a basis for a mean - field treatment of the system and all of them yield the same @xmath128 .",
    "this vast set of `` soft modes '' is , of course , a signature that the true @xmath129 .",
    "thus we may begin with a calculation of @xmath128 which can serve as an upper bound on the true @xmath127 .",
    "consider a spin at site @xmath58 in the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "expanding in small fluctuations about any ground state , we have the same mean - field hamiltonian as in the general mean field _",
    "ansatz _ of section [ mftsec ] , with the mean field given by eqn .",
    "[ hmf ] . in a mean - field treatment , each of the neighbor spins @xmath130 is to be replaced by its average @xmath131 in the particular ground state that we are considering .",
    "in any ground state , we note that the angle between any pair of nearest neighbors is @xmath132 .",
    "in addition , the spins on a tetrahedron add to zero , which allows us to write @xmath133 .",
    "if we further recall that each spin lies on exactly two tetrahedra , we obtain the following expression for the mean field acting at site @xmath58 : @xmath134 note that we have only made use of the _ local _ structure of the ground state , and so our treatment here is relevant for the transition into any state in the ground state manifold . substituting the mean field in eq .",
    "[ mfpc ] into the self - consistency condition ( eqn.[selfc ] ) , we find , in a manner similar to the bipartite case , that the mean - field estimate of the transition temperature is @xmath135 . from this alone we conclude that the @xmath18 state on the pyrochlore lattice is quantum disordered .",
    "there is little question that the actual @xmath127 is much lower than the mean - field estimate and therefore @xmath19 is much higher than @xmath136 , allowing many more quantum disordered states .",
    "as is familiar from other highly frustrated magnets , where the ground - state manifold encompasses a vastly degenerate set of states the transition will be driven by the ` order - by - disorder ' mechanism wherein a particular state or subset of states is favored by entropic effects at low temperatures .",
    "this is a weak effect and hence @xmath127 is typically a small fraction of @xmath128 . from coarse monte carlo simulations we find",
    "evidence that @xmath137 corresponding to @xmath138 .",
    "this leads already to an aklt hamiltonian that is a degree-@xmath139 polynomial in the spins and thus there is little reason in the current context to locate the transition or the nature of the ordered phase with greater precision .    however , we note that the same set of ground states arises in the the classical heisenberg model with nearest neighbor bilinear and biquadratic interactions with the latter chosen to disfavor collinearity .",
    "this is a physically plausible model and we will report a fuller investigation of it elsewhere @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have studied aklt states on two unfrustrated and one frustrated lattice in @xmath6 by a combination of mean - field theory and monte carlo simulations for the associated classical models .",
    "we find that the simple cubic lattice is nel ordered at all values of the singlet parameter @xmath1 and spin @xmath0 ; the diamond lattice , on the other hand , is quantum - disordered for @xmath18 ( @xmath7 ) , and nel ordered for @xmath140 . on the pyrochlore lattice",
    "we find that the @xmath18 ( @xmath8 ) model is definitely disordered and the boundary between disorder and order very likely lies above @xmath141 .    while quantum - disordered ground states in low ( i.e. one and two dimensions ) have often been discussed , three dimensions has historically been the province of long range order . hence our disordered models on the diamond and pyrochlore lattices significantly expand the set of possibilities for quantum ground states of models with heisenberg symmetry in @xmath6 .    in recent",
