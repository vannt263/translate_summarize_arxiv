    "the self - assembly of macromolecular building blocks into structures of well - defined shapes and sizes is a fundamental challenge in nanoscience.@xcite part of the promise of nanoscience is the development of sophisticated supramolecular assemblies that possess multifunctional properties and behavior beyond the capabilities of simpler molecules.@xcite biology is full of examples of such super - structures . in particular ,",
    "microtubules are biopolymers that possess features distinct from standard synthetic polymers because the monomeric building block is a complex protein called tubulin.@xcite a major feature of microtubules not available in synthetic systems is that they are the track upon which kinesin / dynein motor proteins walk .",
    "fast depolymerization of microtubules is an essential part of their biological function and quite distinct from the typical behavior of synthetic polymers .",
    "these special functions and properties originate from the structural arrangement of tubulin in microtubules , which produces very stiff , chiral tubules .",
    "understanding how the interactions between tubulin monomers yield the self - assembly of microtubules and determine their properties is a fundamental open issue .",
    "this issue is pertinent to both biology and materials science , as the special properties of microtubules have led them to be used in synthetic systems to create new materials.@xcite these studies have stimulated interests in developing supramolecular systems that act as `` artificial microtubules '' , i.e. , possess features similar or analogous to microtubules .",
    "a far - reaching issue inherent to nanoscience is the determination of the essential features of a monomer that self - assembles into a tubular structure mimicking microtubules as well as possessing other features of microtubules .",
    "microtubules are both a motivation and an inspiration for our work .",
    "that is , we want to understand both the assembly of tubulin into microtubules and the more general principles of the assembly of artificial tubular structures .",
    "the large amount of data on microtubules helps define our models and provides something to compare to our simulation results .",
    "the monomer of microtubules is a dimer of two proteins , @xmath0 and @xmath1-tubulin .",
    "the dimers form protofilaments via noncovalent longitudinal bonding , and typically 13 protofilaments bind laterally and form tubules with an outer diameter @xmath2 nm.@xcite variations in the number of protofilaments and the helical pitch of microtubules assembled from free tubulin _ in vitro _",
    "are significant.@xcite the structural variations have also been observed to occur to a smaller extent for _ in vivo _",
    "microtubules , where other molecules help control assembly .",
    "these results suggest that the controlled formation of tubules is not simple and understanding the limitations is important for designing synthetic mimics of microtubules .",
    "tubular structures have been observed in synthetic systems .",
    "recently , a few cases of supramolecular systems have been developed that self - assemble into tubules.@xcite tarabout _",
    "constructed a wedge - shaped nanoparticle from beta - sheet - forming polypeptides including an artificial peptide.@xcite the nanoparticle consists of two layers composed of beta sheets , which form a bilayer structure with the hydrophilic groups on its top and bottom that sandwich the hydrophobic groups .",
    "the top layer is wider than the bottom layer due to larger aromatic residues ( including artificial peptides ) at the edge of the top layer .",
    "they showed that the tubule diameter can be controlled by chemical modifications of an aromatic residue involved in the contact of nanoparticles .",
    "et al . _ have found conditions where polypeptide - grafted comblike polymers form tubular structures.@xcite moreover , they found that gold nanoparticles with grafted poly-(l - glutamic acid ) can form tubules under certain circumstances.@xcite in these systems , the monomer is effectively a single nanoparticle and the nanoparticle - nanoparticle interactions dictate the tubule formation .",
    "it is this class of synthetic tubular systems that we are interested in and have developed some new understanding of the role of the interactions between nanoparticles and the control of the self - assembled tubular structures .",
    "there is also a class of small amphiphilic molecules that form tubules typically by initially forming sheets that subsequently roll into tubules.@xcite this class of tubular structures is distinct from microtubules ( e.g. , not as stiff ) and is not the focus of this work , although there is some overlap in the underlying assembly phenomena . for example , shimizu s group developed wedge - shaped amphiphiles by covalently linking hydrophilic groups of different size to the two ends of a hydrophobic spacer.@xcite they experimentally showed that they can control the inner diameter of multilayered nanotubes by varying the length of the hydrophobic spacer.@xcite the wedge geometry does promote tubular structures , but developing these systems into artificial microtubules appears unlikely .",
    "we have previously developed a coarse - grained model monomer with a wedge shape that can self - assemble into tubular structures with the appropriate binding interactions between monomers.@xcite the monomer has lateral interactions that promote ring formation and vertical interactions that promote filament formation .",
    "we used molecular dynamics",
    "( md ) simulations to study the self - assembly process and obtained a diagram of the self - assembled structures as a function of lateral and vertical interaction strengths .",
    "since our model monomers can self - assemble into tubular structures and the resulting tubules exhibit similar structural polymorphism as microtubules , we have a model that can be used to systematically examine the physical origin of structural variations and explore ways to control the structure .",
    "furthermore , the strength of lateral and vertical bonds between tubulin monomers clearly plays important roles in determining the structure of microtubules , but their effects are hard to probe experimentally since natural evolution only leads to one particular set of interaction strengths between tubulin.@xcite directly measuring the interactions between monomers is typically not possible because experiments usually only determine the net free energy difference that is the sum of many interactions .",
    "our model system offers an opportunity to directly calculate the energetics and the structural dynamics of tubules in more detail than previously attempted .",
    "the focus of this work is the physical origin of the factors controlling tubule assembly . to this end",
    ", we have added new features to our model monomer to improve the structural control of the self - assembled tubules based on new understanding of the physical nature of the assembly process .",
    "in particular , we focus on controlling the helicity of self - assembled tubules and have added an explicit chirality to the monomer so that the desired tubule helicity can be input from the monomer chirality .",
    "unexpectedly , our earlier simulations produced helical tubules but with achiral monomers.@xcite we show here that this tubule helicity is a consequence of an underlying rotational symmetry that can occur through a twist deformation of protofilaments .",
    "twist of tubules also occurs with chiral monomers and enables a range of tubule helicity about the desired value to occur , i.e. , the monomer chirality . in other words",
    ", mismatch occurs between the chirality of building blocks and the pitch of assembled tubules .",
    "we incorporate a lock - and - key binding mechanism for the vertical interactions between monomers to more precisely constrain the tubule helicity .",
    "our studies show that the lock - and - key binding combined with monomers with built - in chirality can be used to achieve structural control in the self - assembly of tubules , and therefore provide a guidance on the design of building blocks that will efficiently self - assemble into controlled tubular structures .",

    "only so much twist can occur without resulting in an expensive mismatch between the vertical binding pairs .",
    "the result of multiple pitch values occurring for tubules in thermal equilibrium reveals a limit of treating a microtubule as an elastic tubule within the framework of continuum elasticity , where the twist of the tubule always costs energy and induces a restoring force.@xcite in our simulations , the continuum theory breaks down because of the discrete nature of the building blocks .",
    "the monomers are not deformed in the twist deformation , and thus there is no internal elastic cost .",

    "our results have important implications in the design of macromolecular building blocks that efficiently self - assemble into tubules . in order to form tubules with a given pitch value , we introduced chirality into our model monomers such that in the ideal structure the tubule pitch would match the monomer chirality .",
    "however , we generally find that the self - assembly from free monomers into tubules with a specified pitch value does not occur",
    ". instead a range of pitch values emerges .",
    "we show that the twist deformation stabilizes tubules with pitch inconsistent with the chirality of monomers by better aligning neighboring monomers so that they still bind well .",
    "these twisted tubules can have energy distributions that substantially overlap with that of the untwisted tubule with pitch equal to the monomer chirality .",
    "however , there is a limit to the amount of twist that yields overlapping energy distributions .",
    "besides rotating monomers about the radial axis and aligning the lateral binding sites , twist also rotates the monomers about their vertical axis , which reduces the alignment of the vertical binding sites .",
    "thus , to prevent twist a strong vertical interaction is required that makes protofilaments stiffer and strongly raises the cost of vertical misalignment caused by the twist .",
    "a similar trend was found recently in the packing of filament bundles , where the ground state of a bundle of stiff filaments tend to be untwisted , while filaments with low stiffness form twisted bundles.@xcite however , in our case simply increasing the interaction strength between the vertical binding sites to make protofilaments stiffer does not solve the twist issue because the self - assembly of free monomers with large interaction strengths results in kinetically trapped clusters instead of tubules . in order to overcome this hurdle , we introduced a lock - and - key mechanism into our model monomers for the vertical interactions . in this manner the control of the tubule self - assembly was substantially improved and our assembly simulations were able to achieve a good match between the tubule pitch and monomer chirality .",
    "our results reveal the importance of the vertical interaction strength being larger than the lateral strength in microtubules.@xcite this difference is necessary to prevent twist which would yield a wide range of structures that would not be biologically functional .",
    "the simulations also provide new insight into the _ initial _ assembly dynamics of microtubules ; most experimental work has studied the growth of microtubule ends but not the initial nucleation of microtubules . because the vertical interaction is stronger , the tubulin dimers first form protofilaments via vertical binding and the protofilaments subsequently bind laterally into curved sheets that close to form tubules .",
    "this route generally enhances the structural control of assembled tubules and points to the importance of precise control of the sheet - closing event .",
    "finally , we emphasize that controlling the assembly of tubules to form a specific number of protofilaments and helicity is highly nontrivial and requires many features in the monomer .",
