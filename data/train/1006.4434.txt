    "the first luminous objects in the universe , metal - free or population iii stars , are thought to form in dark matter halos with virial temperatures @xmath4 k corresponding to masses @xmath5 , depending on redshift @xcite . in these `` minihalos '' ,",
    "molecular hydrogen cooling lowers the gas temperature to @xmath6 k , which leads to the formation of either a single star or a binary that may be very massive ( @xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "the first stars begin forming in mihihalos very early in the universe , at redshift @xmath8 @xcite , and might provide the first seeds of supermassive black holes if their mass is sufficient to directly collapse into black holes with @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the locations of minihalos hosting the very first stars are not strongly correlated with the most massive clusters at @xmath10 .",
    "their remnants instead likely reside in halos with masses @xmath11 today @xcite .",
    "as redshift decreases , the metal - free star formation rate rapidly increases because minihalos become progressively more abundant , until negative feedback by lyman werner ( lw ) photons photodissociates h@xmath12 molecular and increases the minimum halo mass required for cooling @xcite .",
    "this happens at @xmath13 , once population iii star number densities @xmath14 reach @xmath15 ( comoving ) .",
    "after that , a self - regulated phase for metal - free star formation sets in @xcite . eventually , the lw background becomes so strong that only halos with @xmath16 k are able to cool .",
    "this likely happens at @xmath17 , when the first metal - enriched galaxies have already been formed @xcite .",
    "metal - enriched and metal - free star formation coexist in different regions of the universe , with metal - enriched galaxies primarily in overdensities and metal - free stars in voids @xcite .",
    "population iii stars continue forming until @xmath18 , although at very low rates @xcite .",
    "the precise details of late population iii star formation are difficult to study , however .",
    "the box sizes needed to enclose rare metal - free star formation at low redshifts , comoving volumes @xmath19 , must also be able to resolve the dm halos @xcite .",
    "doing this with the necesary sub - grid physics and/or post - processing analysis would severely tests the memory limits of any current model .",
    "in addition , population iii star formation might proceed differently in partially ionized gas and possibly result in less massive stars @xcite . the initial mass function ( imf ) of metal enriched stars",
    "is also uncertain at very high redshift because the temperature of protostellar clouds couples to the cmb temperature .",
    "hence , a complex scenario with multiple modes of metal enriched star formation might emerge @xcite .",

    "to address star formation in this complex framework , we start from dark - matter - only halo dynamics , based either on press - schechter models complemented by analytical treatments of self - enrichment @xcite or on detailed halo - merger histories derived from cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "we then populate halos with stars based on an analytical cooling model that accounts for redshift , metallicity and radiative feedback in the lw bands ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfr ] shows our results : metal - free star formation is an extended process over redshift . only at extremely high redshift ( @xmath22 )",
    "does population iii star formation depends just on local halo properties .",
    "based on nomenclature by @xcite , these are population iii.1 stars . at lower redshift , metal - free star formation",
    "is also affected by radiative feedback , and such stars are population iii.2 stars .",
    "some regions of the universe continue to host population iii stars down to relatively low redshift ( @xmath18 ) , although at very low rates ( right panel of figure  [ fig : sfr ] ) .",
    "these late - time population iii stars form in halos with @xmath16 k that are massive enough to cool even in presence of a strong lw background . the dominant process that quenches population iii star formation under these conditions is wind enrichment from neighbor protogalaxies . because of this",
    ", late - time metal - free sources tend to be antibiased , and are preferentially formed in underdense regions @xcite . even if they are clustered , these sources are too faint for direct detection in the near future .",
    "a @xmath23 star at @xmath24 is about 7 magnitudes fainter than the detection limit of the james webb space telescope for a deep field survey .",
    "however , a small cluster of population iii stars could be observed if magnified by gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "alternatively , all - sky surveys reaching @xmath25 could detect population iii stars if they explode as bright supernovae @xcite .",
    "our model also highlights that metal - enriched star formation becomes the dominant mode of star formation at @xmath26 ( left panel of figure  [ fig : sfr ] ) .",
    "this implies that population iii stars play a minor role in the reionization of the universe @xcite , with normal galaxies producing most of the ionizing photons @xcite .",
    "because direct investigation of the properties of metal - free stars is difficult , the properties of the most metal - poor stars in the local universe have been studied to infer the imf of their progenitors @xcite .",
    "the idea behind these `` galactic archeology '' campaigns is that extremely metal - poor stars are likely to be objects formed out of gas enriched only by one previous generation of stars .",
    "if the first generation of stars is very massive ( @xmath27 ) , then nucleosynthetic signatures of pair - instability supernovae should be found in the abundance patterns of extremely metal poor stars @xcite .",
    "the absence of such patterns to date has been interpreted as evidence that the population iii imf lacks very massive stars @xcite .",
    "however , this conclusion ignores wind enrichment and hence rests on the assumption that observed extremely metal poor stars ( @xmath28 ) formed out of gas that was enriched by population iii stars .",
    "our cosmological simulations instead show that metal outflows from dwarf galaxies enrich the majority of the extremely metal poor gas present in milky way progenitors ( figure  [ fig : emp ] and @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that galactic archeology primarily probes the imf of population ii stars , so the absence of pair - instability signatures is not surprising .",
    "the imf of population iii stars remains an open question for the decade to come .",
