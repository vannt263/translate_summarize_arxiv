    "supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite at the tev scale provides one of the most attractive solution to the problem of instability of the higgs mass under radiative correction .",
    "in fact susy forms the template of the physics beyond the standard model ( bsm physics ) that one wishes to probe at the coming colliders like the lhc and the ilc  @xcite . in the @xmath3parity conserving version of the theory , susy also provides a natural dark matter candidate , the lightest neutralino @xmath4 .",
    "however , a consistent tev scale supersymmetry is possible with quite different theoretical realisations at the high scale .",
    "for example , msugra  @xcite and susy - guts with / without seesaw mechanism  @xcite are two models embodying susy with quite different high scale physics , both of which in turn provide a satisfactory explanation of the dark matter ( dm ) in the universe .",
    "the high scale physics of course leaves its imprints on the properties of the sparticles at the electroweak ( ew ) scale .",
    "the issue of being able to distinguish between such different scenarios using collider experiments has been a matter of great interest to the community .",
    "ilc with the possibilities of the high precision measurements offers itself as a natural candidate for the job in hand . in this contribution",
    "we show how a study of @xmath5 sector can offer a good possibility of distinguishing the above mentioned specific scenarios in the @xmath6  @xmath4 co - annihilation region .",
    "recall that the mass eigenstates @xmath7 and @xmath8 are mixtures of @xmath9 and gauginos , higgsinos respectively .",
    "the couplings of a sfermion with a gaugino does not involve a helicity flip whereas that with a higgsino does . as a result the net helicity of the @xmath0 produced in the decay @xmath10 ,",
    "can carry information about @xmath11@xmath3 mixing in the @xmath6 sector as well as that in the @xmath12 sector  @xcite .",
    "in collinear approximation for the @xmath13 decay ; i.e. @xmath14 , the polarisation of the @xmath0 produced , for example , in @xmath15 is given by ,    @xmath16 a^r_{11 } & = & - \\frac{2g}{\\sqrt{2 } } n_{11 } \\tan\\theta_w \\sin\\theta_\\tau - \\frac{gm_\\tau } { \\sqrt{2 } m_w \\cos\\beta } n_{13 } \\cos\\theta_\\tau , \\nonumber \\\\[2 mm ] a^l_{11 } & = & \\frac{g}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\left[n_{12 } + n_{11 } \\tan\\theta_w\\right ] \\cos\\theta_\\tau - \\frac{gm_\\tau}{\\sqrt{2 } m_w \\cos\\beta } n_{13 } \\sin\\theta_\\tau,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have used the standard notation  @xcite with the matrix @xmath17 representing the diagonalising matrix of the neutralino mass matrix with the notation @xmath18 @xmath19 depends on the mixing in the slepton sector as well as that in the neutralino sector which are determined by the susy model parameters ; thus giving a good handle of the measurement of susy parameters .",
    "even more importantly , @xmath0 polarisation can be also measured well at the colliders .",
    "the energy distribution of the @xmath20 produced in the decay , @xmath21 as well as those in @xmath22 depends on the handedness of the @xmath0 .",
    "in fact the angular distribution of the decay meson depends on @xmath0 polarisation and is different for longitudinal and transverse states of the vector meson @xmath23 .",
    "the transverse ( longitudinal ) vector mesons share the energy of parent meson evenly ( unevenly ) among the decay pions . for the @xmath0 decay",
    "the only measurable momentum is @xmath0-jet momentum and its value relative to @xmath24 is determined by the meson decay angle .",
    "hence the energy distribution of decay pions can be used then to measure the @xmath0 polarisation  @xcite . as",
    "a matter of fact a lot of nice analysis of @xmath0 polarisation and hence of the mssm parameter determination at a linear collider , making use of the @xmath25 ( multi - prong ) mode exist  @xcite .",
    "in this note we first discuss a method to determine the @xmath26 using @xmath1prong @xmath20 final state  @xcite .",
    "if we consider the inclusive distributions of the @xmath1prong @xmath20 final state and define @xmath27 , one finds that for @xmath28 the distribution in @xmath3 is peaked at @xmath29 and @xmath30 , whereas for @xmath31 it is peaked in the middle .",
    "the observable @xmath3 can be simply determined by measuring the energies of the @xmath0 in the tracker and the calorimeter .",
    "further , the fraction @xmath32 can be shown to be very nicely correlated with the @xmath0polarisation  @xcite and hence can be used as its measure .",
    "note that full reconstruction of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 as needed in the mutli - prong analysis is also not needed .",
    "distribution for @xmath0 produced in @xmath35 for different values of @xmath19 and right panel shows @xmath36 , defined in text , as a measure of the polarisation .",
    "for details see  @xcite [ fig : taupol ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    distribution for @xmath0 produced in @xmath35 for different values of @xmath19 and right panel shows @xmath36 , defined in text , as a measure of the polarisation . for details",
    "see  @xcite [ fig : taupol ] , title=\"fig:\",width=188,height=188 ]    the left panel in fig.[fig : taupol ] ( taken from  @xcite shows distribution in @xmath3 for different values of polarisations @xmath19 as indicated on the figure for specific choice of @xmath37 , @xmath38 masses and kinematical cuts on @xmath0 mentioned therein .",
    "the right panel shows @xmath36 as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "uncertainty due to the different parameterisations of the @xmath33 and non - resonant contributions to the @xmath20 , give rise to the slight spread of the lines .",
    "one can see from the figure that @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "even if an additional error were to come from the experimental measurement of @xmath36 , still a measurement of @xmath19 with less than @xmath41 error , i.e. @xmath42 is sure to be possible .",
    "there is some dependence of the slope on the kinematics of the @xmath0 , but it is clear from the figure that the use of inclusive 1-prong channel , is a robust method of determining @xmath0 polarisation . if the aim is only to determine @xmath0 polarisation , then the @xmath1prong method has the advantage of higher statistics and smaller systematic errors , compared to the exclusive channel .",
    "let us now see how the properties of the @xmath6 sector and particularly the @xmath0 poalrisation can be used to distinguish between various susy models . in the present case , we will choose msugra model and a susy @xmath43 with seesaw mechanism ( @xmath44 )  @xcite . requiring neutralino dm relic density to be consistent with the recent wmap measurements",
    "significantly reduces the degeneracies present in the parameter space between these two models .",
    "in fact , the effect is quite dramatic ; in contrast to msugra , the susy - gut model has only two  allowed \" regions : ( a ) the _ stau _ coannihilation channel , whose shape is quite different to the corresponding one in msugra mass for a given tan@xmath45 . ] ; ( b ) the a - pole funnel region which does exist for large value of @xmath46 whereas a focus point region is not present at least up to 5 tev in the susy masses  @xcite . from the above it s clear that probing the @xmath47-neutralino sector could give a handle in distinguishing both the models as long as susy spectrum",
    "is determined by the coannihilation region , where the masses of @xmath48 and @xmath4 are very close .",
    "in fact , in our analysis  @xcite , we find that the two models can be clearly distinguished from measuring @xmath19 in the decays of @xmath49 ( fig .",
    "[ ptautau1 ] right panel ) . here for most of the parameter space , the @xmath19 has different signs . in the small overlap region , @xmath50 , which make them distinguishable at the ilc . in the decay , @xmath51",
    ", the tau polarisation can not be really used to distinguish between both the models as we see from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ ptautau1 ] . in our analysis",
    ", we have assumed that @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be distinguished from the kinematics ( as @xmath52 is closer to mass of @xmath4 in the coannihilation region ) .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath19 from @xmath49 in the two frameworks can be understood as follows . in the approximation of @xmath54 ,",
    "very well satisfied in the @xmath47 coannihilation region , @xmath19 just depends on the @xmath11@xmath3 mixing for @xmath47 and is simply related to the parameters entering the @xmath47 mass matrix  @xcite ; given by : @xmath55 here @xmath56 is the soft susy - breaking mass of @xmath57 , @xmath58 the lightest @xmath47 mass eigenvalue and @xmath59 the @xmath11@xmath3 mixing term . from this expression , we can see that the condition for a positive polarization reads : @xmath60 in msugra , such condition can be satisfied for a small region of the paramater space .",
    "the factor 2 on the l.h.s . of eq .",
    "[ polpos ] plays a crucial role . in @xmath44 , the mixing term @xmath61",
    "is enhanced as an effect of rh neutrinos and gut  @xcite , and this tends to make @xmath19 larger .",
    "moreover there is an upper bound on the @xmath4 mass in the coannihilation region : these two effects conspire to keep @xmath19 always positive ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ ptautau1 ] ) .       for msugra and @xmath44 model in @xmath62 decay as a function of the @xmath4 mass .",
