    "there have been many efforts to develop evolutionary population synthesis models ( e.g. bruzual & charlot 1993 ; worthey 1994 ; buzzoni 1995 ; vazdekis et  al . 1996 ; maraston 1998 ; lee et  al .",
    "2000,2002 ) in order to analyze the integrated spectrophotometric quantities of globular clusters ( gcs ) and galaxies .",
    "ultimately , the primary use of such software packages lies in attempting to derive the ages and metallicities of stellar populations such that quantitative insights into the processses governing galaxy formation can be uncovered .",
    "age and metallicity drive the integrated spectrophotometry of stellar systems , and they also drive the resulting hb morphology of globular clusters . it is interesting therefore to pose the question as to whether this underlying morphology also manifests itself in the integrated spectrophotometry .",
    "there is reason to suspect that age is the _ global _ `` second parameter '' that controls hb morphology ( after the `` first parameter '' , metallicity - e.g. lee , demarque & zinn 1994 ; sarajedini , chaboyer & demarque 1997 ; rey et  al .",
    "2001 ; salaris & weiss 2002 ) , although for some gcs a third ( or more ) parameter may be needed to explain their peculiar hb morphologies ( such as the blue tail phenomenon - e.g. recio - blanco et  al .",
    "2002 ) . in what follows",
    ", we describe the unique aspects of our recent models which allow for an accurate determination of the role played by blue hb stars in modifying the spectrophotometric indices of ssps .",
    "the reader is directed to lee et  al .",
    "( 2000,2002 ) for details .",
    "we first construct a grid of simulated gcs spanning a range of hb morphologies - in order to match the observed morphology of inner halo galactic gcs ( galactocentric radius @xmath1  8  kpc ) at their currently favoured mean age ( @xmath212  gyr ) and age dispersion ( @xmath3_t_=0  gyr ) a reimers ( 1975 ) mass loss parameter @xmath4=0.65 was required . the salaris et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) @xmath5-element enhancement correction was applied to our models .",
    "the modified gaussian mass distribution of demarque et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) - with @xmath6=0.02  m@xmath7 - was used , shaping the widths of the `` wavy '' features seen in figure  1 .",
    "the temperature - sensitive b - v and h@xmath0 indices shown there illustrate the magnitude of the contribution of blue hb stars ( thick wavy lines - c.f .",
    "maraston & thomas 2000 ) within @xmath84  gyr of system s mean age .",
    "the resulting wavy features stem primarily from our exploration of parameter space 2@xmath94  gyrs _ older _ than the milky way gcs .",
    "the location of these wavy `` peaks '' is determined by the amount of mass loss adopted .    ) as a function of metallicity and age ( individual curves ) .",
    "the wavy features for ssps older than the galactic gcs are driven by the inclusion of blue hb stars.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "perhaps the greatest value that the addition of far - uv photometry to pre - existing optical data provides is the ability to discriminate _ cleanly _ between young ( @xmath101gyr ) , intermediate - age ( 3@xmath95gyr ) , and old ( @xmath1114gyr ) , metal - rich ( @xmath90.8 @xmath1 [ fe / h ] @xmath1 @xmath90.4 ) , clusters - this ability is demonstrated in figure  2 , where it can be seen that a significant far - uv to optical flux ratio is indicative of either very young or very old systems ( for these metallicities ) . in contrast , intermediate - age clusters are relatively faint in the far - uv .",
    "we suggest that the combination of far - uv and optical colours is a most promising chronometer for ssps ( with the admitted caveat that there are peculiar gcs such as ngc  6388 and 6441 with populations of extremely blue hb stars - e.g. rich et  al .",
    "_ if _ there are significant age differences between milky way and giant elliptical gc systems , however , in the sense of the latter being @xmath112  gyr older ( as suggested by lee et  al .",
    "2000 ) , then we predict that the majority of metal - rich clusters will be far - uv bright compared to their galactic counterparts . in this respect ,",
    "the outcomes of the recent hst far - uv photometry of gc systems in virgo ellipticals ( pids#8643 & 8725 ) are highly anticipated ; future work with hubble s advanced camera for surveys will also be a fruitful avenue of research .",
    "finally , the upcoming galex mission will shed important light on the uv properties of the m31 globular cluster system , perhaps resolving the controversy regarding their supposed young , metal - rich , nature ( e.g. burstein et  al .",
    "1984 ; barmby & huchra 2000 ) .",
    "those galactic gcs with minimal foreground extinction ( filled circles : inner halo clusters ; open circles : outer halo clusters ) are contrasted with our models in the ( @xmath12 @xmath9 @xmath13)@xmath14 , ( @xmath13 @xmath9 @xmath15)@xmath14 , ( @xmath16 @xmath9 @xmath17)@xmath14 , and ( @xmath18 @xmath9 @xmath17)@xmath14 vs. [ fe / h ] planes in figure  3 . the data are taken from harris ( 1996 , 1999 june version ) and harris & canterna ( 1977 ) . we believe this to be one of the first attempts at employing integrated broadband colours to derive relative age differences between subpopulations of galactic gcs .",
    "( @xmath12 @xmath9 @xmath13 ) @xmath10 0.2 ] are used to calibrate our models in the ( @xmath12 @xmath9 @xmath13)@xmath14 , ( @xmath13 @xmath9 @xmath15)@xmath14 , ( @xmath16 @xmath9 @xmath17)@xmath14 , and ( @xmath18 @xmath9 @xmath17)@xmath14 vs. [ fe / h ] planes . the dashed and solid lines represent ages of 10  gyr and 12  gyr , respectively.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    it appears that our models reproduce the differences between inner and outer halo clusters in the sense that the inner halo clusters are not only more tightly grouped along the isochrone than the more scattered outer halo counterparts , but also relatively older .",
    "this relative age difference between inner and outer halo milky way gcs is in agreement with that obtained by salaris & weiss ( 2002 ) from their homogeneous age dating of 55 clusters ( as shown in figure  4 ) .",
    "the hb morphology is responsible for driving the non - linearity seen near [ fe / h ] @xmath2 @xmath91.6 , demonstrating that the inclusion of morphological effects are important if one is to attempt subtle relative age - dating between ssps .        as most of the linear colour - metallicity transformation relations ( cmrs ) in the literature",
    "are based upon the limited range in colour of galactic gcs , caution must be employed when extrapolating their use to redder extragalactic systems ( or if there are sizable age differences amongst globular clusters within and between galaxies ) .",
    "recently , kissler - patig et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) provided a set of cmrs using the globulars of ngc  1399 , but the apparent systematic offset has been questioned by lee et  al .",
    "it remains to be seen if the bimodal colour distributions of extragalactic gc systems can be interpreted as simple metallicity or age differences , or whether a more complicated interplay between metallicity and age must be invoked .",

    "support for this work was provided by the postdoctoral fellowship program of the korea science & engineering foundation , the creative research initiatives program of the korean ministry of science and technology , and the australian research council through its linkage international ( lx0346898 ) and large grant ( a00105171 ) programs .",
