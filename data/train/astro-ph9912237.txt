    "the spin - down of sgr 1900 + 14 from 1966 september to 1999 april ( figure 1 ) is characterized by three intervals of time for which the spin - down rate was essentially constant within the interval .",
    "this characterization of the sgr 1900 + 14 spin - down is based upon both direct measurements of @xmath4 as part of the period determination , and upon differences in measured spin periods between two different observations .",
    "the first interval begins with the rxte observation in september of 1996 and ends with the asca observation at the beginning of may , 1998 .",
    "the mean spin - down @xmath5 6@xmath110@xmath6 s / s @xcite .",
    "the second interval begins with the onset of bursting on may 26 , 1998 and continues until mid - september 1998 .",
    "the mean spin - down during this time @xmath713@xmath110@xmath6 s / s @xcite .",
    "the third interval begins in mid - september 1998 and continues at least until march 30 , 1999 .",
    "the mean spin - down rate at that time is again @xmath0 6@xmath110@xmath6 s / s @xcite .",
    "woods et al .",
    "@xcite ( 1999b ) have suggested that the data may be consistent with a discontinuous spin - down event during the second interval as a result of the giant burst of august 27 , 1998 , as opposed to a doubling of @xmath4 during the entire second interval @xcite .",
    "this suggestion , however , appears to be at odds with the measurement of @xmath4=(11.0@xmath81.7)@xmath110@xmath6 s / s in early june , 1998 @xcite , approximately 3 months before the superburst and with the rxte / asca determination of @xmath5 10@xmath110@xmath6 s / s just after the event @xcite .",
    "a @xmath4 variation of more than a factor of 3 was also indicated in the timing measurements of sgr 1806 - 20 @xcite .",
    "very similar variations in the spin down rate @xmath4 have been observed in axps 1e1048.1 - 5937 and 1e2259 + 58 ( see review by stella , israel , and mereghetti @xcite ) .",
    "such behavior argues strongly against sgr spin - down by magnetic dipole radiation , since that would require large increases ( e.g. @xmath0100% ) in the total magnetic field energy of the star .",
    "the sgr 1900 + 14 observations also strongly argue against magnetic fields as the source of energy for sgr bursts , since that should lead to a decrease in the field energy , and hence a decrease in the spin - down rate during bursting periods .",
    "the observations show the spin - down rate increases .",
    "the association of sgrs 1900 + 14 and 1806 - 20 with radio supernova remnants provides additional evidence as to the origin of their spin - down torques . assuming that the spin - down torque is given by @xmath9 , the age of a pulsar with period @xmath10 and spin - down torque @xmath4 is given by    @xmath11 $ ]    where the spin - down braking index , @xmath12 = 3 for pure magnetic dipole radiation and @xmath13 1 for wind torques .",
    "taking a nominal age of 10 kyr for a detectable @xcite supernova remnant , inverting the age equation yields    @xmath14 .    using @xmath10 = 5.16 s and the long - term @xmath4 = 6@xmath110@xmath6 s / s measured for sgr 1900 + 14",
    ", we find that    @xmath15yr ) ,    and @xmath10 = 7.47 s and the long - term @xmath4 = 8.3@xmath110@xmath6 s / s measured @xcite for sgr 1806 - 20    @xmath16yr ) .",
    "this indicates that the braking index for sgrs 1900 + 14 and 1806 - 20 must be @xmath01 , and that the spin - down of sgr 1900 + 14 is dominated by torques due to the relativistic wind and not magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "addressing these problems , thompson et al @xcite considered a magnetar driven alven wind .",
    "the torque provided by the emission of such a relativistic wind is    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the neutron star moment of inertia , @xmath19 is the mechanical luminosity of the wind , @xmath20 is the spin frequency , @xmath21 is the spin - down rate due to the wind , and @xmath22 is the alfven radius .",
    "@xmath23 is a constant equal to 2/3 for a magnetic dipole field aligned with the rotation axis .",
    "the alfven radius is given by :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the magnetic field of the neutron star .",
    "when the alfven radius is inside the light cylinder radius ( @xmath26 , where @xmath27 ) ,    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the radius of the neutron star and dipole geometry is assumed .",
    "when the alfven is outside the light cylinder radius , the torque is limited to    @xmath30    the transition frequency between these two wind spin - down regimes is     @xmath31 radians / s .",
    "the torque due to a rotating magnetic dipole is :    @xmath32    where k = 1 @xcite .",
    "once the total spin - down torque is specified as a function of @xmath33 , the age of the sgr can found by the integral of @xmath34 over the total torque divided by @xmath18 , where the integration is performed from an initial frequency to the present - day angular frequency .",
    "using the above model we explore a wide range of magnetic fields @xmath25 and wind luminosity @xmath19 , shown in fig .",
    "we see in the upper panel that the presently observed period of @xmath10 = 5.157 s , the spindown rate of @xmath35 s / s ( dotted lines ) of sgr 1900 + 14 , and the 10 to 20 kyr range of ages ( solid lines ) of its associated supernova remnant g42.8 + 0.6 @xcite , tightly constrain the allowable magnetic field to @xmath36 g and wind luminosities @xmath37 erg / s .",
    "compared to the quiescent 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity of @xmath38 erg / s @xcite , this wind luminosity implies a @xmath3 2 % conversion efficiency of wind energy to x - rays in that band which is quite consistent with theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "we also see in the lower panel of fig .",
    "2 , that a similar set of constraints can be obtained for sgr 1806 - 20 and its supernova remnant g10.0 - 0.3 , using the present spin period @xcite @xmath10=7.47 s and @xmath4 = 8.3@xmath110@xmath6s / s . again ,",
    "a wind luminosity with @xmath32% conversion efficiency to x - rays yields a sub - critical ( @xmath39 g ) magnetic field .",
    "the limit for sgr 1806 - 20 is very similar that found from a comparable analyses by harding et al",
    "thus , we see that with such winds the magnetic field limits are quite consistent with the limiting values inferred for normal radio pulsars , but not with those expected for magnetars .",
    "we show that the large variations in the spin down rate @xmath4 measured in sgrs and axps argue strongly against spin - down by magnetic dipole radiation , since that would require large increases ( e.g. @xmath0100% ) in the total magnetic field energy of the star .",
    "the sgr 1900 + 14 observations also strongly argue against magnetic fields as the source of energy for sgr bursts , since that should lead to a decrease in the field energy , and hence a decrease in the spin - down rate during bursting periods rather than the increase observed .",
    "we further show from the braking indicies that the spin - down torque of the two sgrs is in fact due to winds , not magnetic dipole radiation , and that with such the magnetic fields are @xmath40 g , which is quite consistent with normal pulsars , but not with magnetars ."
