    "the first detection of the transit of an exoplanet in front of its parent star ( @xcite ; @xcite ) opened a new avenue to determine the characteristics of these exotic worlds .",
    "for all but the most eccentric cases , approximately half - an - orbit after their transits these planets pass behind their star along our line of sight allowing their thermal flux to be measured in the infrared .",
    "the first detections of an exoplanet s thermal emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) came from observations in space with spitzer using the infrared array camera ( irac ; @xcite ) . since then the vast majority of such measurements have been made using spitzer at wavelengths longer than 3 @xmath10 , and thus longwards of the blackbody peak of these `` hot '' exoplanets .",
    "recent observations have extended secondary eclipse detections into the near - infrared ; the first detection was from space with nicmos on the hubble space telescope ( @xcite at @xmath112 @xmath10 ) .",
    "more recently , near - infrared detections have been achieved from the ground ; the first of these detections include a @xmath116@xmath1 detection in k - band of tres-3b using the william herschel telescope @xcite , a @xmath114@xmath1 detection in z-band of ogle - tr-56b using magellan and the very large telescope ( vlt ; @xcite ) , and a @xmath115@xmath1 detection at @xmath112.1 @xmath10 of corot-1b also with the vlt @xcite .",
    "thermal emission measurements in the near - infrared are crucial to our understanding of these planets atmospheres , as they allow us to constrain hot jupiters thermal emission near their blackbody peaks .",
    "the combination of spitzer / irac and near - infrared thermal emission measurements allows us to constrain the temperature - pressure profiles of these planets atmospheres over a range of pressures @xcite , better estimate the bolometric luminosity of these planets dayside emission , and thus contributes to a more complete understanding of how these planets transport heat from the day to nightside at a variety of depths and pressures in their atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the transiting hot jupiter tres-2b orbits a g0 v star with a period of @xmath112.47 @xmath12 @xcite . according to the @xcite theory this places tres-2b marginally in the hottest ,",
    "mostly highly irradiated class ( the pm - class ) of hot jupiters and close to the dividing line between this hottest class and the merely warm class of hot jupiters ( the pl - class ) .",
    "thus tres-2b could be a key object to refine the dividing line between these two classes , and indicate the physical cause of this demarcation , or reveal whether this divide even exists .",
    "recently @xcite used spitzer / irac to measure the depth of the secondary eclipse of tres-2b in the four irac bands .",
    "their best - fit eclipses are consistent with a circular orbit , and collectively they are able to place a 3@xmath1 limit on the eccentricity , @xmath2 , and argument of periastron , @xmath3 , of @xmath4@xmath2cos@xmath3@xmath4 @xmath6 0.0036 .",
    "their best - fit eclipses at 3.6 , 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath10 are well - fit by a blackbody . at 4.5 @xmath10",
    "they detect excess emission , in agreement with the theory of several researchers ( @xcite ) that predicts such excess due to water emission , rather than absorption , at this wavelength due to a temperature inversion in the atmosphere .",
    "one - dimensional radiative - equilibrium models for hot jupiter planets generally show that the atmospheric opacity is dominated by water vapor , which is especially high in the mid - infrared , but has prominent windows ( the jhk bands ) in the near infrared @xcite .",
    "one can probe more deeply , to gas at higher pressure , in these opacity windows .",
    "models without temperature inversions feature strong emission in the jhk bands , since one sees down to the hotter gas .",
    "models with temperature inversions , since they feature a relatively hotter upper atmosphere and relatively cooler lower atmosphere , yield weaker emission in the near - ir ( jhk ) , but stronger emission in the mid - infrared @xcite .",
    "near - infrared thermal emission measurements should thus be useful to determine whether tres-2b does or does not harbour a temperature inversion .",
    "owing to its high irradiation , with an incident flux of @xmath11@xmath13@xmath14@xmath15 @xmath16@xmath17@xmath18 , and favourable planet - to - star radius ratio ( @xmath19@xmath110.13 ) , we included tres-2b in our program observing the secondary eclipses of some of the hottest of the hot jupiters from the ground . here",
    "we present ks - band observations bracketing tres-2b s secondary eclipse using the wide - field infrared camera ( wircam ) on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "we report a 5@xmath1 detection of its thermal emission .",
    "we observed tres-2 ( @xmath9=9.846 ) with wircam @xcite on cfht on 2009 june 10 under photometric conditions .",
    "the observations lasted for @xmath113.5 hours evenly bracketing the predicted secondary eclipse of this hot jupiter assuming it has a circular orbit .",
    "numerous reference stars were also observed in the 21x21 arcmin field of view of wircam . to minimize the impact of flat field errors , intrapixel variations and to keep the flux of the target star well below detector saturation , we defocused the telescope to 1.5 mm , such that the flux of our target was spread over a ring @xmath1120 pixels in diameter ( 6 ) on our array .",
    "we observed tres-2 in `` stare '' mode on cfht where the target star is observed continuously without dithering .",
    "5-second exposures were used to avoid saturation . to increase the observing efficiency we acquired a series of data - cubes each containing twelve 5-second exposures .",
    "the twelve exposure data - cube is the maximum number of exposures allowed in a guide - cube in queue mode at cfht . to counteract drifts in the position of the stars positions on the wircam chips , which we had noticed in earlier wircam observations of secondary",
    "eclipses @xcite , we initiated a corrective guiding `` bump '' before every image cube to recenter the stellar point - spread - function as near as possible to the original pixels at the start of the observation .",
    "the effective duty cycle after accounting for readout and for saving exposures was 43% .",
    "the images were preprocessed with the  iiwi pipeline .",
    "this pipeline includes the following steps : applying a non - linearity flux correction , removing bad and saturated pixels , dark subtraction , flat - fielding , sky subtraction , zero - point calibration and a rough astrometry determination .",
    "we sky subtract our data by constructing a normalized sky frame built by taking the median of a stack of source - masked and background - normalized on - sky images .",
    "our on - sky images consist of 15 dithered in - focus images observed before and after the on - target sequence .",
    "for each on - target image the normalized sky frame is scaled to the target median background level and then subtracted .",
    "we performed aperture photometry on our target star and all unsaturated , reasonably bright reference stars on the wircam array .",
    "we used a circular aperture with a radius of 12.5 pixels .",
    "we tested larger and smaller apertures in increments of 0.5 pixels , and confirmed that this size of aperture returned optimal photometry .",
    "the residual background was estimated using an annulus with an inner radius of 21 pixels , and an outer radius of 30 pixels ; a few different sizes of sky annuli were tested , and it was found that the accuracy of the resulting photometry was not particularly sensitive to the size of the sky aperture . as tres-2 has a nearby reference star ( 0.17  separation ) that falls in our sky aperture , we exclude a slice of the annulus that falls near this reference star to avoid any bias in background determination to -45@xmath20 degrees as measured from due north towards the east are excluded from our annulus . ] . during our observations , despite the aforementioned corrective `` bump '' to keep the centroid of our stellar point - spread - function ( psf ) as steady as possible , our target star and the rest of the stars on our array displayed high frequency shifts in position ( figure [ figshifts ] ) . to ensure that the apertures for our photometry were centered in the middle of the stellar psfs",
    ", we used a center - of - mass calculation , with pixel flux substituted for mass , to determine the x and y center of our defocused stellar rings for each one of our target and reference star apertures .",
    "the light curves for our target and reference stars following our aperture photometry displayed significant , systematic variations in intensity ( see the top panel of figure [ figtres2brefstars ] ) , possibly due to changes in atmospheric transmission , seeing and airmass , guiding errors and/or other effects . the target light curve was then corrected for these systematic variations by normalizing its flux to the 11   reference stars that show the smallest deviation from the target star outside of the expected occultation .",
    "reference stars that showed significant deviations in - eclipse from that of the target star and other reference stars , as indicated by a much larger root - mean - square in - eclipse than out - of - eclipse due to intermittent systematic effects for instance , were also excluded . for the reference stars that were chosen for the comparison to our target star",
    ", the flux of each one of these star was divided by its median - value , and then an average reference star light curve was produced by taking the mean of the lightcurves of these median - corrected reference stars .",
    "the target flux was then normalized by this mean reference star light curve .",

    "note that the majority of the reference stars with the smallest out of occultation residuals to our target star are on the same chip as our target , despite the fact that there are other reference stars on other chips closer in magnitude to our target .",
    "we believe this is due to the differential electronic response of the different wircam chips , and have noticed this same effect with other wircam observations of other hot jupiter secondary eclipses @xcite .",
    "following this correction we noticed that the flux of our target and reference stars displayed near - linear correlations with the x or y position of the centroid of the stellar psf on the chip .",
    "given the aforementioned high frequecy of these shifts ( fig .",
    "[ figshifts ] ) this suggests that any leftover trend with position and the flux of the star was instrumental in origin .",
    "thus these near - linear trends ( figure [ figshiftscorrection ] top panels ) were removed from the data for both the target and reference stars by performing a fit to the x and y position of the centroid of the psf and the normalized flux for the out - of - eclipse photometry .",
    "we fit the out - of - eclipse photometric flux to the x and y position of the centroid of the psf with a function of the following form : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are constants .",
    "we then apply this correction to both the in - eclipse and out - of - eclipse photometry .",
    "the out - of - eclipse photometric data prior to and following this correction are displayed in figure [ figshiftscorrection ] ( bottom panels ) .",
    "no other trends that were correlated with instrumental parameters were found .    by correcting the flux of our target with these 11reference stars and by removing the above correlation with the x / y position on the chip the point - to - point scatter of our data outside occultation improves from a root - mean - square ( rms ) of 13.7@xmath1410@xmath25  to 0.71@xmath1410@xmath25  per every 58 @xmath26 ( or 5  images ) .",
    "the photometry following the aforementioned analysis is largely free of systematics , as evidenced by the fact that the out - of - eclipse photometric precision lies near the gaussian noise expectation for binning the data of one over the square - root of the bin - size ( figure [ figbinbyn ] ) .",
    "our observations in ks - band , though , are still well above the predicted photon noise rms limit of 2.3@xmath1410@xmath27 per 58 seconds . for the following analysis we set the uncertainty on our individual measurements as 0.95 times the rms of the out of eclipse photometry after the removal of a linear - trend with time ; we found simply using 1.0 times the rms of the out - of - eclipse photometry resulted in a reduced @xmath28 below one , and thus resulted in a slight over - estimate of our errors .",
    "similarly to nearly all our near - infrared photometric data - sets taken with cfht / wircam ( e.g. @xcite ) , our ks - band photometry following the reduction exhibited an obvious background trend , @xmath29 .",
    "this background term displayed a near - linear slope , and thus we fit the background with a linear - function of the form : @xmath30 where dt is the time interval from the beginning of the observations , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the fit parameters .",
    "given that most of our other data - sets display these background trends , it is unlikely , but not impossible , that this slope is intrinsic to tres-2 .",

    "the combination of our blackbody and radiative transfer models with our own eclipse depth and those from the spitzer / irac instrument @xcite thus suggest that the atmosphere of tres-2b likely features modest redistribution of heat from the day to the nightside .",
    "it is unclear whether the atmosphere of tres-2b requires a temperature inversion . a simple blackbody model ( @xmath70=0.346 and @xmath68@xmath111622 k ) provides an exemplary fit to the data ;",
    "this may indicate that tres-2b has a fairly isothermal dayside temperature structure , perhaps similar to hat - p-1b @xcite .",
    "an important caveat , on the above result is that our @xmath70=@xmath72 model without tio / vo ( @xmath28=5.5 ) and thus without a temperature inversion returns nearly as good of fit as our best - fit blackbody model ( @xmath70=0.346 ; @xmath28=4.7 ) ; thermal emission measurements at other wavelengths , and repeated measurements at the above wavelengths , are thus necessary to differentiate a blackbody - like spectrum , from significant departures from blackbody - like behaviour , and to confirm that tres-2b efficiently redistributes heat to the nightside of the planet .",
    "specifically , the variations between the models displayed in figure [ figmodel ] are largest in the near - infrared j & h - bands and thus further near - infrared constraints  if they are able to achieve sufficient accuracy to measure the small thermal emission signal of tres-2b in the near - infrared  should prove eminently useful to constrain the atmospheric characteristics of this planet .",
    "if the excess emission at 4.5 @xmath10 is due to water emission , rather than absorption , due to a temperature inversion in the atmosphere of tres-2b then the inversion is unlikely to be due to tio / vo .",
    "this is because the atmosphere of tres-2b appears too cool to allow tio / vo to remain in gaseous form in its upper atmosphere .",
    "if there is a temperature inversion then the high altitude optical absorber is likely to be due to another chemical species than tio / vo .",
    "for instance , @xcite have investigated the photochemistry of sulphur - bearing species as another alternative .",
    "tres-2b is a promising target for the characterization of its thermal emission across a wide wavelength range .",
    "in addition to orbiting a relatively bright star , and having a favourable planet - to - star radius ratio , tres-2 lies within the kepler field .",
    "the combination of secondary eclipse measurements already published using spitzer / irac , upcoming measurements with kepler ( @xmath11430 - 900 @xmath86 ; @xcite ) , and j , h and k - band near - infrared measurements that could be obtained from the ground , will allow us to fully constrain tres-2b s energy budget . at the shorter end of this wavelength range it should also be possible to constrain the combination of reflected light and thermal emission .",
    "our results predict that even if the geometric albedo of tres-2b is as low as 5% in the kepler bandpass , if kepler is able to detect the secondary eclipse of this planet then it will be detecting a significant fraction of reflected light in addition to thermal emission .",
    "this will largely break the degeneracy on the bond albedo and the reradiation factor for this planet , facilitating a more complete understanding of its energy budget .",
    "the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada supports the research of b.c . and r.j .",
    "the authors would like to thank marten van kerkwijk for helping to optimize these observations , and norman murray for useful discussions .",
    "the authors especially appreciate the hard - work and diligence of the cfht staff in helping us pioneer this `` stare '' method on wircam .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for a thorough review ."
