    "unifying quarks and leptons in the same multiplet of a gauge symmetry group is very elegant , and answers naturally why the quarks have fractional charges while the leptons have integer charges . such an unification has been achieved in the framework of partial unification in @xmath1  @xcite , or grand unification such as @xmath2  @xcite or @xmath3  @xcite . the leptoquark gauge bosons present in such grand unification lead to proton decay which has not been observed so far , and pushes the mass scale of these leptoquark gauge bosons to @xmath4 gev .",
    "this is well beyond the reach of any present or future high energy collider . in the partial unification model , such as pati - salam type ,",
    "since @xmath5 and the fermion number is conserved , there is no proton decay by the leptoquark gauge bosons .",
    "however , the leptoquark gauge boson here can cause rare meson decays , such as @xmath6 and @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the upper limit for the combined branching ratio for these two rare modes is @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "this gives the mass of the exchanged leptoquark gauge boson to be @xmath9 tev .",
    "this is well above the current or future lhc reach .",
    "the question we address in this work is can we have a model in which the leptoquark gauge boson has a mass in the tev scale which can be probed at the lhc ?",
    "one trick to achieve such a low scale for quark - lepton unification in the framework of @xmath10 is to pair the known quarks with some new leptons , and the known leptons with some new quarks .",
    "then the leptoquark gauge bosons will couple known quarks with these new leptons , and the known leptons with new quarks .",
    "this will avoid the limits from the above flavor - violating rare meson decay limits , by choosing the mixing angles between the ordinary and new fermions small . but this will cause problems with the precision electroweak parameters , since these new fermions will be chiral and we are doubling chiral fermion sector of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "however , such a scenario can be implemented by considering pati - salam type model in the framework of extra dimensions , say in five dimensions .",
    "then upon orbifold compactification of the extra dimension , the zero modes of the new fermions can be projected out , leaving only the known quarks and leptons as the zero modes .",
    "the same orbifold compactification can be used to break the @xmath10 symmetry to @xmath11 and will give masses to the leptoquark gauge bosons at the compactification scale which can be chosen at a tev .",
    "after compactification , in the four dimensional theory , the new fermions will have only kaluza - klein modes , and will be vector - like , thus avoiding any problem with the electroweak ( ew ) precision parameters .",
    "we will implement this scenario with the simplest pati - salam type model with the gauge symmetry @xmath12 in five dimensions ; and breaking the symmetry to @xmath13 upon compactification to four dimensions .",
    "@xmath14 will be broken down to @xmath15 using the usual higgs mechanism .",
    "the leptoquark gauge bosons , as well as the new quarks ( which will be the lightest kk excitations ) , with masses at the tev scale can be produced at the lhc giving distinctive signals for new physics .",
    "we mention here that quark lepton unification using higher dimension has been considered by adibzadeh and p. q. hung @xcite , however their gauge symemmtry is different from ours , and there main objective was obtaining naturally light dirac neutrino and fermion localization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss a five dimensional non - supersymmetric formulation of the model . in section iii , we discuss the one loop radiative correction , and calculate the particle spectrum .",
    "the phenomenological implications of the model : the productions , decays , and the new physics signals are discussed in section iv . in section",
    "v , we give a five dimensional supersymmetric version of the model .",
    "section vi contains our conclusions .",
    "our gauge symmetry is @xmath16 in five dimensions .",
    "the @xmath10 symmetry unifying quarks and leptons is broken down to @xmath17 by compactifying the extra dimension , @xmath18 on a @xmath19 orbifold .",
    "( the breaking of gauge symmetry via orbifold compactification is very elegant and has been extensively used in the literature to build realistic models  @xcite ) . the remaining symmetry , @xmath20 in our model in four dimensions ( 4d ) is then broken down to the sm by using appropriate higgs multiplets .",
    "all the particles , gauge bosons , higgs bosons , as well as the fermions , propagate in the bulk , similar to the universal extra dimensions ( ued)@xcite .",
    "in the five - dimensional orbifold models the five - dimensional manifold is factorized into the product of ordinary four - dimensional minkowski space - time @xmath21 and the orbifold @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding coordinates are @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 .",
    "the radius for the fifth dimension is @xmath25 .",
    "the orbifold @xmath19 is obtained by @xmath26 moduloing the equivalent class @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "there are two fixed points , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the gauge fields for @xmath16 in five dimensions are @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , respectively , and @xmath34 .",
    "all belong to the adjoint representations of the corresponding gauge symmetry . for generical five - dimensional gauge fields",
    "@xmath35 , we have four - dimensional gauge fields @xmath36 and real scalar fields @xmath37 .",
    "the fermion and higgs representations in five dimensions have @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xmath40 where the numbers in the parentheses represent the quantum numbers with respect to the gauge symmetry , @xmath41 .    in the usual",
    "left and right handed notation , the particle contents in @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46,@xmath47 are @xmath48 where we neglect the family indices @xmath49 .",
    "these represent the fermions in one family .",
    "there are three such families .",
    "note that the fermion content in each family has been quadrupled where @xmath50 and @xmath51 represent the usual fermions in a family ( including a right - handed neutrino in each family ) , and the primes represent the additional fermions with same corresponding quantum numbers .",
    "note that the leptoquark gauge bosons connect ordinary quarks to the exotic ( primed ) leptons , and ordinary leptons to exotic ( primed ) quarks .",
    "this will avoid the high experimental bound on the masses of these leptoquarks , and will allow us a low compactification scale for the @xmath52 breaking .",
    "we now discuss the gauge symmetry breaking via orbifold compactification , to break the @xmath10 gauge symmetry down to the @xmath53 gauge symmetry . under the @xmath54 and @xmath55 parity operators",
    "@xmath56 , and @xmath57 , the vector fields transform as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the @xmath60th component of the vector field .",
    "the fermion multiplets belonging to the fundamental representation of the gauge symmetry transform as @xmath61 and similarly for the other fields . in a short - hand notation ,",
    "the transformation properties of the fields are given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 takes the value only @xmath64 .",
    "to project out the zero modes of the fifth component of gauge fields , and the appropriate modes for the fermion fields , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 and others , we choose the following @xmath65 matrix representations for the parity operators @xmath56 and @xmath66 @xmath67 under the @xmath66 parity , the gauge generators @xmath68 ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 , ... , @xmath71 ) for @xmath10 are separated into two sets : @xmath72 are the generators for the @xmath73 gauge group , and @xmath74 are the generators for the broken gauge group @xmath75 @xmath76 the zero modes of the @xmath77 gauge bosons are projected out , thus , the five - dimensional @xmath10 gauge symmetry is broken down to the four - dimensional @xmath53 gauge symmetry .",
    "for the @xmath78 gauge symmetry , we choose @xmath79 and for the @xmath80 gauge symmetry , we choose @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the @xmath82 remains unbroken after orbifold compactification .    denoting the generical fields @xmath83 with parities ( @xmath56 , @xmath66)=(@xmath84 ) by @xmath85",
    ", we obtain the kk mode expansions @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a non - negative integer . the four - dimensional fields @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 acquire masses @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 upon the compactification .",
    "zero modes are contained only in @xmath98 fields .",
    "moreover , only @xmath98 and @xmath99 fields have non - zero values at @xmath29 , and only @xmath98 and @xmath100 fields have non - zero values at @xmath30 .",
    ".parity assignments and masses ( @xmath101 ) for the bulk fields . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in our models , the yukawa couplings in the superpotential are @xmath102 where @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are non - zero only for @xmath107 and @xmath108 . because @xmath109 will obtain a vev around 1 tev , the active neutrinos will obtain the observed masses via seesaw mechanism if @xmath103 are about @xmath110 for @xmath108 .",
    "next , let us discuss the @xmath20 gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "we denote the gauge fields for @xmath111 and @xmath15 as @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively . to give the vevs to @xmath109 and @xmath114 , we consider the following superpotential @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the sm singlet fields , and @xmath117 is a mass parameter . from the f - term flatness for @xmath116",
    ", we obtain that @xmath109 and @xmath114 will respectively acquire vevs @xmath118 and @xmath119 where @xmath120 .",
    "thus , the @xmath20 gauge symmetries are broken down to the @xmath15 gauge symmetry by higgs mechanism .",
    "furthermore , let us comment on the dark matter in our models .",
    "there are @xmath121 symmetries in our models , thus , we can have two dark matter candidates . including the radiative corrections",
    ", we find that one dark matter candidate from one linear combination of @xmath122 and the neutral components of @xmath123 , and the other dark matter candidate from one linear combination of @xmath124 and the neutral components of @xmath125 after we consider the yukawa contributions . at the lhc , @xmath126 and @xmath127",
    "can be produced via gluon fusions , and then decays .",
    "the interesting lhc signals in our models are the di - leptons and four leptons plus jets for final states .",
    "thus , we may want that @xmath128 are lighter than @xmath126 and @xmath127 , which can be realized via the yukawa interactions .    for simplicity , we consider @xmath129 and @xmath130 are diagonal for @xmath131 .",
    "thus , the mass matrix for @xmath132 is @xmath133 where @xmath134 is @xmath135 plus the radiative corrections , and @xmath136 because @xmath137 are also parts of the neutrino dirac masses , we assume they are very small about @xmath138 gev or smaller .",
    "otherwise , we have to fine - tune the neutrino dirac masses on the 3-branes at two fixed points so that the neutrino dirac masses are about @xmath138 gev or smaller .",
    "thus , choosing @xmath139 we obtain the following four eigenvalues @xmath140 where @xmath141 and the corresponding eigenvectors are @xmath142 thus , we can indeed have two relatively light states and two relatively heavy states with large mixings . similarly",
    ", we can study the mass matrix for @xmath143 , and get the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenvectors . in this case , the two light neutral states are dark matter candidates .",
    "motivated by possible new physics which can be observed at the lhc , we have proposed a model which have leptoquarks as color triplet gauge bosons at the tev scale .",
    "such color triplet gauge boson , though exist in the grand unified theories , such as @xmath2 or @xmath3 , they cause proton decay , and their masses are of the order of @xmath144 gev . in the partially unified models of pati - salam type , these leptoquark gauge bosons do not cause proton decay",
    ". however , they can cause rare meson decays which set the lower bound on their masses to be greater than @xmath145 tev .",
    "this motivated us to construct a model of partial unification based on the gauge symmetry @xmath16 in _ five _ dimensions .",
    "this symmetry is broken to the usual sm gauge symmetry in four dimensions by compactification on an orbifold at a tev scale . in order to avoid the constraint from the rare meson decays , we paired up sm quarks with new leptons , and the sm leptons with new quarks .",
    "these new quarks and leptons in the model have no zero modes , have only their kk excitations in the spectrum with masses in the tev .",
    "these kk excitations are also vector - like , and thus avoid any problem with the precision electroweak parameters .",
    "furthermore , since the leptoquark gauge bosons in the model couple only to quarks and new leptons , or leptons and new quarks , their high mass limits from the rare meson decays are also avoided .",
    "because they are colored , these leptoquark gauge bosons , as well as the new quarks with masses in the tev scale can be produced at the lhc with large cross sections .",
    "the lightest particle in the spectrum is a neutral lepton , and is stable , giving the possibility of being a candidate for the dark matter .",
    "we have calculated the mass spectrum and the decay modes of these new particles in the model .",
    "the final state signals are high @xmath0 jets and high @xmath0 leptons with large missing energy .",
    "the most dominant signals are 2 charged leptons and 2 hard jets plus missing @xmath146 or 1 charged lepton and 3 hard jets plus missing transverse energy , and are observable at the lhc .",
    "the four lepton signal with at lease 2 hard jets , though small , will have very little sm background , and should be observable .",
    "the model also has a large monojet signal with a high @xmath0 jet and large missing energy .",
    "finally , one of the new quarks ( up - type ) has a five - body decay mode , and is long - lived .",
    "it will hadronize , and these charged hadrons will leave tracks as they pass through the detector .",
    "we are very grateful to many helpful discussions with j. lykken .",
    "we also thank g. giudice , d. hooper and g. servant for several useful discussions .",
    "sn was a summer visitor at fermilab and cern when this work was in progress , and he thanks the fermilab theory group and cern theory group for warm hospitality and support during these visits .",
