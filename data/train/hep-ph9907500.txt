    "the high statistics and accuracy of experimental measurements at lep and slc result in the outstanding level of precision in definition of the standard model parameters ( see ref .  @xcite and references therein ) . in this situation effects of radiative corrections are of great importance .",
    "one of particular contributions to the process of electron  positron annihilation is the radiation of secondary pairs . in comparison with the photon radiation , it is relatively small , because it appears only starting from the @xmath0 order .",
    "nevertheless , the total effect of pair production can reach several permil ( or even e few percent in particular cases ) and should be taken into account .",
    "we will consider here the reactions of the following type : e^+  +  e^-  f  +  |f  +  ( f|f ( ) ) , where @xmath1 is the so - called primary fermionic pair , @xmath2 is the secondary one , and @xmath3 stands for the usual photon radiation , which can take place in our case starting from the third order @xmath4 .",
    "the primary pair is the one registered in the particular measurement",
    ". the secondary one can be either real or virtual , and has to be accounted as a radiative correction according to certain experimental conditions ( with some restrictions ( cuts ) , if required ) . in principle , the pairs can be of the same flavour , like in the process @xmath5 .",
    "when both pairs are seen in the detector , one has to apply an algorithm to choose the primary pair .",
    "the complete second order qed calculation for production of the initial state secondary pairs ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and hadrons ) was performed in refs .",
    "the corresponding final state effect was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the interference between amplitudes for the initial and final state pair production has not been calculated systematically .",
    "an estimate of this effect will be presented in the conclusions .",
    "it is observed , that the @xmath0 approximation is not adequate to provide the desirable precision , especially in the region close to the @xmath8-peak . from another side , at lep2 ,",
    "when the radiative return is allowed , qed radiative corrections reach several hundred percent and should be evaluated with care . in order to achieve the precision , required by the experiments ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , one should consider higher orders of the perturbation theory .",
    "another important point is that in the @xmath8-peak region the sub ",
    "leading corrections are comparable in size with the leading ones .",
    "so , one has to go beyond the leading log approximation ( lla ) .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to describe and discuss the treatment of pair corrections , implemented in the semi  analytical code zfitter",
    "v.6.30  @xcite .",
    "the main attention will be paid to the third order corrections .",
    "some numerical illustrations will be given .",
    "the uncertainty of the approach will be analyzed in the conclusions .",
    "starting from the @xmath9 order , one has amplitudes with simultaneous emission of pairs and photons .",
    "we treat them as a part of pair corrections , because they have not been taken into account in the traditional photonic rc .",
    "the main subject of this article is to analyze this effect .    as usually in @xmath6 annihilation ,",
    "the most important contributions are from the initial state ( is ) radiation ( real and virtual ) . in a typical high  energy experiment , the conditions of the kinoshita  lee ",
    "nauenberg theorem are fulfilled for the final state ( fs ) radiation .",
    "that is why the large logarithms ( mass singularities ) cancel out in the fs correction , and the latter becomes relatively small . from the other hand ,",
    "a specific energy dependence of the kernel cross section can provoke an enhancement of the is correction , like it happens at the @xmath8-peak or in the radiative return to the resonance at lep2 .",
    "pair corrections to the process of @xmath10 become ambiguous , when one observes @xmath11-fermion final states . nevertheless , the bulk of the pair rc to the @xmath12-fermion observables is coming from the kinematical situations , when the secondary pair is either virtual or escapes registration ( in the beam pipe or because of a small energy ) . on",
    "could try to subtract from the experimental data all real secondary pairs by means of a monte carlo generator .",
    "but that would destroy the cancellation between the real and virtual pairs , and the corrections would become even more pronounced and dangerous .",
    "one can get a serious numerical instability , trying to subtract both the virtual and the real pairs by means of different codes .",
    "even if the subtraction of the pure second order pairs is evaluated perfectly , we have to keep in mind the higher order corrections due to instantaneous emission of pairs and photons .",
    "the cancellation between the virtual and real pair rc is important not only in the @xmath4 , but in higher orders as well .",
    "indeed , we would end up with a completely wrong third order corrections ( the error would exceed the entire effect ) , if we were using for the subtraction of virtual and real pair contributions two different codes , one with the third order pair - photon effect and another one without it .    here",
    "we will follow the definition of signal and background according to feynman diagrams , as discussed in ref .  @xcite . in figure  1",
    "we show several representatives of feynman graphs for real pair production processes . only the diagrams fig .",
    "1@xmath13 and fig .  1@xmath14 ( plus the ones with pair production via a virtual photon emitted from the initial state positron of the final state anti ",
    "fermion @xmath15 ) are to be accounted as the signal .",
    "these diagrams describe the non  singlet ( ns ) mechanism of pair production .",
    "the diagrams of the type @xmath16 and @xmath17 with the production of a secondary pair via a virtual @xmath8-boson are treated as background .",
    "the so - called multi  peripheral process is described by fig .",
    "diagrams of type @xmath19 represent the singlet mechanism of pair production .",
    "their contribution is considered as a background too . the pure electroweak four ",
    "fermion processes with @xmath20-boson intermediate states fall into a separate class  @xcite from both the theoretical and the experimental points of view .",
    "the relevant ( signal ) feynman graphs for virtual pair corrections are given in figure  2 .",
    "in other words we will count only the non  singlet secondary pairs produced via virtual photons fig .",
    "1@xmath21 ( some numbers for the singlet pairs will be presented ) . the contribution from the so - called background diagrams , like multi  peripheral , double ",
    "resonant @xmath22 , and singlet pair production , are supposed to be subtracted from the data .",
    "interferences between the _ signal _ and _ background _ amplitudes are typically small , but some of them , like the ones between the is singlet and non  singlet pairs , should be taken into account .",
    "we will not use any direct cut on the phase space volume of real secondary pairs ( an inclusive treatment of radiative events ) . only the condition ( see eq .",
    "( [ cuts ] ) ) on the primary pair invariant mass @xmath23 will be applied ( the dependence on the secondary pair invariant mass will be shown for the fs correction ) .      in the lowest order for the fs pair corrections we use the results of ref .",
    "our aim here is to estimate the effect of higher orders .",
    "concerning the interplay with the is photonic corrections , it is claimed , that the final state pair corrections should be realized in the multiplicative way : [ multip ] = _",
    "( 1+_)(1 + _ ) , where @xmath24 stands for the initial state photonic correction , and @xmath25 gives the final state pair one . at lep2 energies ,",
    "when the radiative return to the @xmath8-peak is allowed , we have huge values of @xmath24 ( typically above 100 percent ) , and the additive summation of the corrections @xmath26 fails completely . in principle , the initial state pair correction should participate in formula  ( [ multip ] ) together with the photonic one , but , as one can see from numerical illustrations , an additive treatment of the is and fs pair corrections is acceptable as well .    the effect of simultaneous photon and pair radiation from the final state can be estimated by multiplying the corresponding contributions : @xmath27 fs photon rc and the @xmath4 fs pair rc .",
    "one can see that this source does not give more than 0.05 permil in the accepted signal definition .",
    "this estimate was confirmed also by a computation ( analogous to eq .",
    "( [ sig3p ] ) ) of the @xmath28 lla result for the fs non  singlet pairs .",
    "it is worth to note here , that additional strong cuts on the final state photons and pairs can increase the fs corrections and revive the problem of the corresponding missing higher order terms .",
    ".radiative correction @xmath29 in permil for different cuts .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "first we have to remind about the effect of the initial  final interference ( ifi ) in pair corrections .",
    "we suggest to estimate it by using the known effect for the ifi in photonic corrections .",
    "the bulk of the ifi pair correction is provided by the terms of the order @xmath30 ( the sub ",
    "leading logarithms ) .",
    "the terms are coming from the kinematical region of small  invariant  mass real pairs ( and from the corresponding region of integration over virtual pairs ) .",
    "thus , one can use the factorization of the correction factors , corresponding to the photon emission and the pair production .",
    "so , we just multiply the ifi photonic correction by the factor @xmath31 and receive the estimate for the ifi pair rc @xmath32 . the typical value of the photonic ifi rc at lep energies is a few permil , therefore one can safely neglect the corresponding pair contribution . note , that in this way we considered only the non  singlet mechanism of pair production .",
    "the interference of the initial state singlet pair production amplitudes with the final state ns ones is expected to be of the same magnitude .",
    "let us discuss now the uncertainty in the pair corrections .",
    "we mean just the indefiniteness in the treatment of hadronic pairs and of the @xmath28 ( and higher order ) leptonic pair corrections .",
    "other sources , relevant for concrete experiments , like the problem to distinguish between the primary and secondary pair or the proper subtraction of the background , have to be discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "first we suppose , that 15% is a reasonably safe estimate for the error in the second order hadronic pair contribution itself . in this case",
    "we use a phenomenological approach based on the measurements of electron  positron annihilation into hadrons at low energies .",
    "the absence on the market of a _ plug  and  play _ parameterization of the @xmath33-function ( ratio of the annihilation cross sections into hadrons and muons ) does not allow to put a better precision level .",
    "for our computations of the fs hadronic pairs a simple parameterization of the function was constructed .",
    "the dispersion relations were used to look at the corresponding vacuum polarization effect and check the function . the stability in respect of the fluctuations in involved data was verified .",
    "a good agreement was observed with the published numbers on hadronic pair corrections  @xcite in both the initial and the final states .",
    "the uncertainty of the higher order leptonic pairs is derived as follows .",
    "we assume that the leading logs @xmath34 , especially the ones multiplied by a power of @xmath35 , are taken into account completely .",
    "as stated above , all sub - leading terms can not be generated neither by convolution nor by exponentiation .",
    "therefore , we can estimate the error of the third order contribution to be about @xmath36 ( actually we take @xmath37 ) of its own size . for the third order hadronic contribution , derived by means of convolution",
    ", we should take into account also the intrinsic uncertainty in hadronic pairs , discussed above .",
    "as concerning the fourth and higher orders , we suggest to take the error just of the order @xmath38 @xmath6 contribution ( for all flavours together ) .",
    "the situation is better for the case of the final state pair corrections : the phenomenological treatment of hadronic pairs and the omitted effect of the interplay between the fs photons and pairs can not lead to more than 10 percent error in the fs pair rc , which is already small itself . remind also the interference between the initial and final pair production amplitudes , discussed above . collecting the sources of theoretical uncertainties , involved into our approach , we conclude : _ i ) _ at lep1 energies the error is about 0.4 permil on the wings and 0.2 permil on the top of the resonance ; _ ii ) _ at lep2 , when the radiative return to the @xmath8-peak is forbidden , we have a reasonably good error of about 0.1 permil ( for the realistic cut @xmath39 ; _ iii ) _ when the radiative return is allowed , the size of the error can reach 1 permil .",
    "the approach to pair corrections described here is implemented into the semi  analytical code zfitter v.6.30",
    "@xcite . a treatment of higher order pairs ( with pair ",
    "photon interplay ) is available also in topaz0  @xcite , geantle  @xcite , koralw  @xcite , and some other codes .",
