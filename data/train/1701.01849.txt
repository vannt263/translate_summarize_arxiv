    "let @xmath3 be the space of degree @xmath4 polynomials in @xmath5 variables over an algebraically closed field @xmath1 of characteristic @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 be the inverse limit of the @xmath3 , equipped with the zariski topology and its natural @xmath2 action ( see  [ ss : note ] ) .",
    "this paper is concerned with the following question :    [ mainques ] is the space @xmath7 noetherian with respect to the @xmath2 action ?",
    "that is , can every zariski - closed @xmath2-stable subspace be defined by finitely many orbits of equations ?",
    "this question may seem somewhat esoteric , but it is motivated by recent work in the field of representation stability , in particular the theory of twisted commutative algebras ; see  [ ss : tca ] .",
    "it is also connected to certain uniformity questions in commutative algebra in the spirit of ( the now resolved ) stillman s conjecture ; see  [ ss : stillman ] .",
    "for @xmath8 the question is easy since one can explicitly determine the @xmath2 orbits on @xmath7 . for @xmath9",
    "this is not possible , and the problem is much harder . the purpose of this paper is to settle the @xmath10 case :    [ mainthm ] question  [ mainques ] has an affirmative answer for @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , we prove a quantitative result in finitely many variables that implies the theorem in the limit . this may be of independent interest ; see  [ ss : overview ] for details .",
    "the key concept in the proof , and the focus of most of this paper , is the following notion of rank for cubic forms",
    ".    let @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "we define the * q - rank*. ] of @xmath13 , denoted @xmath14 , to be the minimal non - negative integer @xmath15 for which there is an expression @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , or @xmath19 if no such @xmath15 exists ( which can only happen if @xmath20 ) .",
    "[ ex1 ] for @xmath12 , the cubic @xmath21 has q - rank @xmath5 .",
    "this is proved in  [ sec : example ] . in particular ,",
    "infinite q - rank is possible when @xmath20 .",
    "the cubic @xmath22 has q - rank  1 , as follows from the identity @xmath23 the cubic @xmath24 therefore has q - rank at most @xmath5 , and we expect it is exactly @xmath5 .",
    "the notion of q - rank is similar to some other invariants in the literature :    1 .",
    "hochster @xcite define a homogeneous polynomial to have * strength * @xmath25 if it does not belong to an ideal generated by @xmath26 forms of strictly lower degree .",
    "for cubics , q - rank is equal to strength plus one .",
    "the paper @xcite ( inspired by tao s blog post @xcite ) introduced the notion of `` slice rank '' for tensors .",
    "q - rank is basically a symmetric version of this .",
    "let @xmath27 be the locus of forms @xmath13 with @xmath28 .",
    "this is the image of the map",
    "@xmath29 the main theorem of @xcite implies that the domain of the above map is @xmath2-noetherian , and so , by standard facts ( see @xcite ) , its image @xmath27 is as well .",
    "it follows that any @xmath2-stable closed subset of @xmath0 of bounded q - rank is cut out by finitely many orbits of equations .",
    "theorem  [ mainthm ] then follows from the following result :    [ mainthm2 ] any @xmath2-stable subset of @xmath0 containing forms of arbitrarily high q - rank is zariski dense .    to prove this theorem",
    ", one must show that if @xmath30 is a sequence in @xmath0 of unbounded q - rank then for any @xmath4 there is a @xmath26 such that the orbit - closure of @xmath31 projects surjectively onto @xmath32 .",
    "we prove a quantitative version of this statement :    [ mainthm3 ] let @xmath11 have q - rank @xmath33 ( in fact , @xmath34 suffices ) , and suppose @xmath35",
    ". then the orbit closure of @xmath13 surjects onto @xmath32 .",
    "the proof of this theorem is really the heart of the paper .",
    "the idea is as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath36 has large q - rank .",
    "we establish two key facts .",
    "first , after possibly degenerating @xmath13 ( i.e. , passing to a form in the orbit - closure ) one can assume that the @xmath37 s and @xmath38 s are in separate sets of variables , while maintaining the assumption that @xmath13 has large q - rank .",
    "this is useful when studying the orbit closoure , as it allows us to move the @xmath39 s and @xmath40 s independently .",
    "second , we show that @xmath40 s have large rank in a very stong sense : namely , that within the linear span of the @xmath40 s there is a large - dimensional subspace such that every non - zero element of it has large rank .",
    "the results of @xcite then imply that the orbit closure of @xmath41 in @xmath42 surjects onto @xmath43 , and this yields the theorem .",
    "we now explain one source of motivation for question  [ mainques ] .",
    "an * ideal invariant * is a rule that assigns to each homogeneous ideal @xmath44 in each standard - graded polynomial @xmath1-algebra @xmath45 ( in finitely many variables ) a quantity @xmath46 , such that @xmath47 only depends on the pair @xmath48 up to isomorphism .",
    "we say that @xmath49 is * cone - stable * if @xmath50}(i[x])=\\nu_a(i)$ ] , that is , adjoining a new variable does not affect @xmath49 .",
    "the main theorem of @xcite is ( in part ) :    [ thm : ess ] the following are equivalent :    1 .",
    "let @xmath49 be a cone - stable ideal invariant that is upper semi - continuous in flat families , and let @xmath51 be a tuple of non - negative integers .",
    "then there exists an integer @xmath52 such that @xmath47 is either infinite or at most @xmath52 whenever @xmath44 is an ideal generated by @xmath15 elements of degrees @xmath53 .",
    "( crucially , @xmath52 does not depend on @xmath45 . )",
    "2 .   for every @xmath54 as above",
    ", the space @xmath55 is @xmath56-noetherian .",
    "define an ideal invariant @xmath49 by taking @xmath47 to be the projective dimension of @xmath44 as an @xmath45-module .",
    "this is cone - stable and upper semi - continuous in flat families .",
    "the boundedness in theorem  [ thm : ess](a ) for this @xmath49 is exactly stillman s conjecture , proved in @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ thm : ess ] shows that question  [ mainques ] is intimately connected to uniformity questions in commutative algbera in the style of stillman s conjecture .",
    "the results of @xcite are actually more precise : if part ( b ) holds for a single @xmath54 then part ( a ) holds for the corresponding @xmath54 .",
    "thus , combined with theorem  [ mainthm ] , we obtain :    [ thm : cubicinv ] let @xmath49 be a cone - stable ideal invariant that is upper semi - continuous in flat families .",
    "then there exists an integer @xmath52 such that @xmath57 is either infinite or at most @xmath52 , whenever @xmath44 is generated by a single cubic form .",
    "the following two consequences of theorem  [ thm : cubicinv ] are taken from @xcite .",
    "given a positive integer @xmath58 there is an integer @xmath52 such that the following holds : if @xmath59 is a cubic hypersurface containing finitely many codimension @xmath58 linear subspaces then it contains at most @xmath52 such subspaces .",
    "given a positive integer @xmath58 there is an integer @xmath52 such that the following holds : if @xmath59 is a cubic hypersurface whose singular locus has codimension @xmath58 then its singular locus has degree at most @xmath52",
    ".    it would be interesting if these results could be proved by means of classical algebraic geometry .",
    "it would also be interesting to determine the bound @xmath52 for some small values of @xmath58 .",
    "in this section we put @xmath60 .",
    "our original motivation for considering question  [ mainques ] came from the theory of twisted commutative algebras .",
    "recall that a * twisted commutative algebra * ( tca ) over the complex numbers is a commutative unital associative @xmath61-algebra @xmath45 equipped with a polynomial action of @xmath2 ; see @xcite for background .",
    "the easiest examples of tca s come by taking the symmetric algebra on a polynomial representation of @xmath2 : for example , @xmath62 or @xmath63 .",
    "tca s have appeared in several applications in recent years , for instance :    * modules over the tca @xmath62 are equivalent to @xmath64-modules , as studied in @xcite .",
    "the structure of the module category was worked out in great detail in @xcite .",
    "* finite length modules over the tca @xmath63 are equivalent to algebraic representations of the infinite orthogonal group @xcite .",
    "* modules over tca s generated in degree  1 were used to study @xmath65-modules in @xcite , with applications to syzygies of segre embeddings .",
    "a tca @xmath45 is * noetherian * if its module category is locally noetherian ; explicitly , this means that any submodule of a finitely generated @xmath45-module is finitely generated .",
    "a major open question in the theory , first raised in @xcite , is :    is every finitely generated tca noetherian ?",
    "so far , our knowledge on this question is extremely limited . for tca s generated in degrees",
    "@xmath66 ( or more generally , `` bounded '' tca s ) , noetherianity was proved in @xcite .",
    "( it was later reproved in the special case of @xmath64-modules in @xcite . ) for the tca s @xmath63 and @xmath67 , noetherianity was proved in @xcite .",
    "no other cases are known .",
    "we remark that these known cases of noetherianity , limited though they are , have been crucial in applications .",
    "since noetherianity is such a difficult property to study , it is useful to consider a weaker notion .",
    "a tca @xmath45 is * topologically noetherian * if every radical ideal is the radical of a finitely generated ideal .",
    "the results of @xcite show that tca s generated in degrees @xmath68 are topologically noetherian .",
    "topological noetherianity of the tca @xmath69 is equivalent to the noetherianity of the space @xmath70 appearing in question  [ mainques ] .",
    "thus theorem  [ mainthm ] can be restated as :    the tca @xmath71 is topologically noetherian .",
    "this is the first noetherianity result for an unbounded tca generated in degrees @xmath72 .      using similar methods",
    ", we can prove the following result :    the space @xmath73 is noetherian with respect to the action of the group @xmath74 , where @xmath75 denotes the completed tensor product .",
    "we plan to write a short note containing the proof .",
    "in  [ sec : qrank ] we establish a number of basic facts about q - rank . in ",
    "[ sec : proof ] we use these facts to prove the main theorem .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : example ] , we compute the q - rank of the cubic in example  [ ex1 ] .",
    "this example is not used in the proof of the main theorem , but we thought it worthwhile to include one non - trivial computation of our fundamental invariant .      throughout we let @xmath1 be an algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath6 .",
    "the symbols @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 will always denote @xmath1-vector spaces , perhaps infinite dimensional .",
    "we write @xmath79 for the space of degree @xmath4 polynomials on @xmath77 equipped with the zariski topology .",
    "precisely , we identify @xmath80 with the spectrum of the ring @xmath81 .",
    "when @xmath77 is infinite dimensional the elements of @xmath80 are certain infinite series and the functions on @xmath80 are polynomials in coefficients .",
    "whenever we speak of the orbit of an element of @xmath80 , we mean its @xmath82 orbit .",

    "initially we allow @xmath77 to be infinite dimensional , but following proposition  [ prop : inf ] it will be finite dimensional ( though this is often not necessary ) .",
    "our first result is immediate , but worthwhile to write out explicitly .",
    "[ prop : subadd ] suppose @xmath84 .",
    "then @xmath85    we defined q - rank from an algebraic point of view ( number of terms in a certain sum ) .",

    "let @xmath91 be dual to @xmath92 .",
    "we can then write @xmath93 , where every term in @xmath94 uses one of the variables @xmath95 , and these variables do not appear in @xmath96 .",
    "since @xmath97 by assumption and @xmath98 by its definition , we find @xmath99 .",
    "but @xmath96 only uses the variables @xmath100 , and these are coordinates on @xmath78 , so we must have @xmath101 .",
    "thus every term of @xmath13 has one of the variables @xmath102 in it , and so we can write @xmath103 for appropriate @xmath104 , which shows @xmath28 .    in the above proposition ,",
    "@xmath97 means that the image of @xmath13 in @xmath105 is  0 .",
    "it is equivalent to ask @xmath106 for all @xmath107 .",
