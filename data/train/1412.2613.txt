    "range - separated density - functional theory ( dft ) ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) is an attractive approach for improving the accuracy of kohn - sham dft  @xcite applied with usual local or semi - local density - functional approximations .",
    "this approach is particularly relevant for the treatment of electronic systems with strong ( static ) or weak ( van der waals ) correlation effects .",
    "the strategy of range - separated dft consists in separating the coulomb electron - electron interaction into long - range and short - range components , and treating the long - range part by an explicit many - body wave - function method and the short - range part by a density - functional approximation .",
    "in particular , for describing systems with van der waals dispersion interactions , it is appropriate to use methods based on many - body perturbation theory for the long - range part such as second - order perturbation theory  @xcite , coupled - cluster theory  @xcite , or random - phase approximations  @xcite .    among the advantages of using such many - body methods for the long - range part only of the electron - electron interaction",
    "is that they are much less sensitive to the one - electron atomic basis compared to the case of the standard coulomb interaction .",
    "this has been repeatedly observed in calculations using dunning correlation - consistent basis sets  @xcite for second - order perturbation theory  @xcite , coupled - cluster theory  @xcite and random - phase approximations  @xcite .",
    "the physical reason for this reduced sensitivity to the basis is easy to understand . in the standard coulomb - interaction case",
    ", the many - body wave - function method must describe the short - range part of the correlation hole around the electron - electron coalescence which requires a lot of one - electron basis functions with high angular momentum . in the range - separation case",
    ", the many - body method is relieved from describing the short - range part of the correlation hole , which is instead built in the density - functional approximation .",
    "the basis set is thus only used to describe a wave function with simply long - range electron - electron correlations ( and the one - electron density ) which does not require basis functions with very high angular momentum .    in the case of the coulomb interaction ,",
    "the rate of convergence of the many - body methods with respect to the size of the basis has been well studied .",
    "it has been theoretically shown that , for the ground - state of the helium atom , the partial - wave expansion of the energy calculated by second - order perturbation theory or by full configuration interaction ( fci ) converges as @xmath3 where @xmath0 in the maximal angular momentum of the expansion  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this result has been extended to arbitrary atoms in second - order perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "this has motivated the proposal of a scheme for extrapolating the correlation energy to the complete - basis - set ( cbs ) limit based on a @xmath4 power - law dependence of the correlation energy on the cardinal number @xmath2 of the dunning hierarchical basis sets  @xcite .",
    "this extrapolation scheme is widely used , together with other more empirical extrapolation schemes  @xcite . in the case of range - separated dft",
    "the rate of convergence of the many - body methods with respect to the size of the basis has never been carefully studied , even though the reduced sensitivity to the basis is one of the most appealing feature of this approach .    in this work",
    ", we provide a detailed study of the basis convergence of range - separated dft .",
    "first , we review the theory of range - separated dft methods ( section  [ sec : rsdft ] ) and we study the convergence of the partial - wave expansion of the long - range wave function near the electron - electron coalescence .",
    "we show that the rate of convergence is exponential with respect to the maximal angular momentum @xmath0 ( section  [ sec : pwexpand ] ) .",
    "second , we study the convergence of the long - range second - order mller - plesset ( mp2 ) correlation energy of four systems ( he , ne , n@xmath1 , and h@xmath1o ) with the cardinal number @xmath2 of the dunning basis sets , and find that the error in the correlation energy is best fitted by an exponential in @xmath2 .",
    "this leads us to propose a three - point cbs extrapolation scheme for range - separated dft based on an exponential formula ( section  [ sec : basisconv ] ) .",
    "hartree atomic units are used throughout this work .",
    "in range - separated dft , the exact ground - state energy of an electronic system is expressed as a minimization over multideterminantal wave functions @xmath5 ( see , e.g. , ref .  )",

    "we define the long - range interaction @xmath12 with the error function @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the distance between two electrons and @xmath15 ( in bohr@xmath16 ) controls the range of the separation , with @xmath17 acting as a smooth cutoff radius . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the long - range interaction vanishes and range - separated dft reduces to standard kohn - sham dft . in the opposite limit @xmath19 ,",
    "the long - range interaction becomes the coulomb interaction and range - separated dft reduces to standard wave - function theory . in practical applications ,",

    "the exact ground - state energy is then expressed as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the long - range correlation energy which is to be approximated by perturbation theory .",
    "for example , in the long - range variant of mp2 perturbation theory , the long - range correlation energy is  @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the first - order correction to the wave function @xmath21 ( with intermediate normalization ) . in the basis of rsh spin orbitals",

    "beyond perturbation theory approaches , eq .",
    "( [ hpsiepsi ] ) can be ( approximately ) solved using configuration interaction  @xcite or multiconfigurational self - consistent field  @xcite methods .",
    "alternatively , it has also been proposed to use density - matrix functional approximations for the long - range part of the calculation  @xcite .    since the rsh scheme of eq .",
    "( [ eminphi ] ) simply corresponds to a single - determinant hybrid dft calculation with long - range hartree - fock ( hf ) exchange , it is clear that the energy @xmath38 has an exponential basis convergence , just as standard hf theory  @xcite .",
    "we will thus focus our study on the basis convergence of the long - range wave function @xmath21 and the long - range mp2 correlation energy @xmath34 .",
    "in this section , we study the convergence of the partial - wave expansion of the wave function at small interelectronic distances , _",
    "i.e. _  near the electron - electron coalescence , which for the case of the coulomb interaction determines the convergence of the correlation energy .",
    "we first briefly review the well - known case of the coulomb interaction and then consider the case of the long - range interaction .      for systems with coulomb electron - electron interaction @xmath39",
    ", the electron - electron cusp condition  @xcite imposes the wave function to be linear with respect to @xmath14 when @xmath40  @xcite @xmath41 here and in the rest of this section , we consider only the dependence of the wave function on @xmath14 and we restrict ourselves to the most common case of the two electrons being in a natural - parity singlet state  @xcite for which @xmath42 .",
    "the function @xmath43 thus gives the behavior of the wave function at small interelectronic distances .",
    "writing @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the relative angle between the position vectors @xmath46 and @xmath47 of the two electrons , the function @xmath48 can be written as a partial - wave expansion @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the legendre polynomials and the coefficients @xmath51 are @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath51 decrease slowly with @xmath55 when @xmath56 and @xmath57 are similar . in particular , for @xmath58 , we have @xmath59 as @xmath60  @xcite . therefore , the approximation of @xmath48 by a truncated partial - wave expansion , @xmath61 , @xmath62 also converges slowly with @xmath0 near @xmath63 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ cusp_plot ] ( left ) which shows 1+@xmath64 as a function of @xmath45 for @xmath65 bohr for increasing values of the maximal angular momentum @xmath0 . comparing with the converged value corresponding to @xmath66 [ eq .",
    "( [ fr12inf ] ) ] , it is clear that the convergence near the singularity at @xmath67 is indeed painstakingly slow .",
    "this slow convergence of the wave function near the electron - electron coalescence leads to the slow @xmath68 power - law convergence of the partial - wave increments to the correlation energy  @xcite or , equivalently , to the @xmath3 power - law convergence of the truncation error in the correlation energy  @xcite .      for systems with the long - range electron - electron interaction @xmath69 ,",
    "the behavior of the wave function for small interelectronic distances @xmath14 was determined by gori - giorgi and savin  @xcite @xmath70 where the function @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 we thus need to study the function @xmath73 for a fixed value of @xmath15 , and for @xmath74 , it yields @xmath75 which exhibits no linear term in @xmath14 , _",
    "i.e. _  no electron - electron cusp . on the other hand , for @xmath76 and @xmath77",
    ", we obtain @xmath78 _ i.e. _  the coulomb electron - electron cusp is recovered .",
    "the function @xmath79 thus makes the transition between the cuspless long - range wave function and the coulomb wave function .    as for the coulomb case",
    ", we write @xmath79 as a partial - wave expansion @xmath80 and calculate with mathematica  @xcite the coefficients @xmath81 for each @xmath55 @xmath82 with @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and using the following explicit expression for @xmath85 @xmath86 since the partial - wave expansion of the first term in @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( [ fexpand ] ) terminates at @xmath88 , we expect a fast convergence with @xmath55 of @xmath81 , for @xmath15 small enough , and thus also a fast convergence of the truncated partial - wave expansion @xmath89 plots of this truncated partial - wave expansion for @xmath90 in figure  [ cusp_plot ] ( right ) confirm this expectation . the coulomb singularity at @xmath67 has disappeared and the approximation @xmath91 converges indeed very fast with @xmath0 , being converged to better than @xmath92 a.u . already at @xmath93 .",
    "we study in detail the dependence of the coefficients of the partial - wave expansion @xmath81 on @xmath55 .",
    "we compare two possible convergence behaviors , a power - law form @xmath94 and an exponential - law form @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are ( @xmath15-dependent ) parameters .    to determine which form best represents @xmath81 , in figure [ cvrate_plot ] we plot @xmath100 for @xmath101 as a function of @xmath102 ( left ) and as a function of @xmath55 ( right ) , for several values of @xmath15 , as well as for the coulomb case ( @xmath76 )  @xcite .",
    "a straight line on the plot of @xmath100 vs. @xmath102 indicates a power - law dependence , whereas a straight line on the plot of @xmath103 vs. @xmath55 indicates an exponential - law dependence .",
    "for the coulomb case ( black curve nearly superimposed with the curve for @xmath104 ) , we observe that the plot of @xmath105 vs. @xmath102 is linear , whereas the plot of @xmath105 vs. @xmath55 is curved upward .",
    "this is expected for a power law @xmath106 form .",
    "moreover , we find @xmath107 as expected from section  [ coulomb_case ] .",
    "when going from large to small values of @xmath15 , we observe that the plot of @xmath103 vs. @xmath102 becomes more and more curved downward , and the plot of @xmath103 vs. @xmath55 becomes more and more linear .",
    "we thus go from a power - law dependence to an exponential - law dependence . already for @xmath108 ,",
    "the exponential law is a better description than the power law .",
    "when @xmath15 decreases , the absolute value of the slope of the plot of @xmath103 vs. @xmath55 increases , _ i.e. _  the convergence becomes increasingly fast .",
    "more precisely , we have found @xmath109 for @xmath108 .    the exponential convergence of the partial - wave expansion of the long - range wave function near the electron - electron coalescence implies a similar exponential convergence for the partial - wave expansion of the corresponding energy .",
    "the present study is thus consistent with the approximate exponential convergence of the partial - wave expansion of the energy of the helium atom in the presence of a long - range electron - electron interaction reported in refs .  .",
    "however , no quantitative comparison can be made between the latter work and the present work since the form of the long - range interaction is different .",
    "in this section , we study the convergence of the long - range wave function and correlation energy with respect to the size of the one - particle atomic basis .",
    "this problem is closely related to the convergence of the partial - wave expansion studied in the previous section . indeed , for a two - electron atom in a singlet s state , it is possible to use the spherical - harmonic addition theorem to obtain the partial - wave expansion in terms of the relative angle @xmath45 between two electrons by products of the spherical harmonic part @xmath110 of the one - particle atomic basis functions @xmath111 where @xmath112 with spherical angles @xmath113,@xmath114 and @xmath115,@xmath116 .",
    "the partial - wave expansion can thus be obtained from a one - particle atomic basis , provided that the basis saturates the radial degree of freedom for each angular momentum @xmath55 . in practice , of course , for the basis sets that we use , this latter condition is not satisfied .",
    "nevertheless , one can expect the convergence with the maximal angular momentum @xmath0 of the basis to be similar to the convergence of the partial - wave expansion .    for this study",

    "as the signs of @xmath126 are undetermined we have chosen a positive leading coefficient @xmath129 , and we assumed that all the other coefficients are negative @xmath130 for @xmath131  @xcite . even though it has been shown that , for the case of the coulomb interaction , there are in fact positive coefficients in the expansion in addition to the leading one , for a weakly correlated system such as the he atom , these positive coefficients appear only in larger basis sets than the ones that we consider here and have negligible magnitude  @xcite .    in figure  [ cuspbasis ]",
    "we show the convergence of the fci wave function @xmath132 with the cardinal number @xmath2 for @xmath76 which corresponds to the coulomb interaction ( left ) and for @xmath133 ( right ) .",

    "the curve of @xmath132 as a function of @xmath45 reveals the angular correlation between the electrons  @xcite .",
    "clearly , correlation is much weaker for the long - range interaction .",
    "note that a single - determinant wave function @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is a spherically symmetric 1s orbital , does not depend on @xmath45 , and the hf and rsh single - determinant wave functions indeed just give horizontal lines in figure  [ cuspbasis ] .",
    "the fact that figure  [ cuspbasis ] resembles figure  [ cusp_plot ] confirms that the convergence with respect to @xmath2 is similar to the convergence of the partial - wave expansion with respect to @xmath0 , and thus corroborates the relevance of the study of section  [ sec : pwexpand ] for practical calculations . as for the partial - wave expansion , the convergence with @xmath2 of the coulomb wave function near the electron - electron cusp is exceedingly slow .",
    "the long - range wave function does not have an electron - electron cusp and converges much faster with @xmath2 , the differences between the curves obtained with the cc - pv5z and cc - pv6z basis being smaller than 0.03 mhartree .",
    "note , however , that the convergence of the long - range wave function seems a bit less systematic than the convergence of the coulomb wave function , with the difference between the cc - pvqz and cc - pv5z basis being about 3 times larger than the difference between the cc - pvtz and cc - pvqz basis .",
    "this may hint to the fact the dunning basis sets have been optimized for the coulomb interaction and are not optimal for the long - range interaction .",
    "finally , we note that we have found the same convergence behavior with the short - range exchange - correlation lda density functional of ref .  .",

    "we use the squared pearson correlation coefficient @xmath156 as a measure of the quality of the fit .",
    "for the coulomb interaction and for all the systems studied , the best fit is achieved with the power law @xmath157 with @xmath158 , which is roughly what is expected  @xcite .",
    "we note however that the fits to the exponential law are also very good with @xmath159 when the @xmath155 value is excluded .",
    "this explains why extrapolations of the total energy based on an exponential formula have also been used for the case of the coulomb interaction  @xcite . for the case of the long - range interaction , the difference between the fits to the power law and to",
    "the exponential law is much bigger .",
    "the best fit is by far obtained for the exponential law with @xmath159 for all systems and ranges of @xmath2 considered .",
    "this exponential convergence of the long - range correlation energy with respect to @xmath2 is in accordance with the exponential convergence of the partial - wave expansion of the long - range wave - function observed in section  [ sec : pwexpand ] .",
    "we have also performed fits for several other values of @xmath15 between @xmath160 and @xmath161 and always obtained an exponential convergence of the long - range valence mp2 correlation energy with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "however , contrary to what was observed for the partial - wave expansion , we found that when @xmath15 decreases @xmath99 also decreases a bit for the four systems considered .",
    "in other words , when the interaction becomes more long range , the convergence of the long - range correlation energy becomes slower .",
    "this surprising result may be due to the fact that the cc - pv6z result may not be as good an estimate of the cbs limit when @xmath15 increases .",
    "when @xmath15 decreases , the prefactor @xmath97 decreases and goes to zero for @xmath18 , as expected .",
    "moreover , we have also checked that we obtain very similar results for the long - range all - electron mp2 correlation energy ( including core excitations ) with cc - pcv@xmath2z basis sets .",
    "we note that prendergast _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have argued that the removal of the electron - electron cusp in a small region around the coalescence point does not significantly improve the convergence of the energy in the millihartree level of accuracy . at first sight , their conclusion might appear to be in contradiction with our observation of the exponential convergence of the long - range correlation energy with @xmath2 .",
    "there are however important differences between the two studies : ( 1 ) their form of long - range interaction is different from ours , ( 2 ) they consider interelectronic distance `` cutoffs '' of @xmath162 bohr whereas we consider larger `` cutoffs '' @xmath163 bohr , ( 3 ) they do not investigate exponential - law versus power - law convergence .    finally , in the appendix we provide a complement analysis of the basis convergence of the correlation energy of the he atom for truncated configuration - interaction ( ci ) calculations in natural orbitals .",
    "the analysis shows that , contrary to the case of the coulomb interaction , the convergence of the long - range correlation energy is no longer limited by the truncation rank the ci wave function but by the basis convergence of the natural orbitals themselves .",
    "this result is consistent with an exponential basis convergence of the long - range correlation energy .",
    "for the long - range interaction case , since both the rsh energy and the long - range correlation energy have an exponential convergence with respect to the cardinal number @xmath2 , we propose to extrapolate the total energy to the cbs limit by using a three - point extrapolation scheme based on an exponential formula .",
    "suppose that we have calculated three total energies @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 for three consecutive cardinal numbers @xmath2 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 .",
    "if we write @xmath169 @xmath170 @xmath171 and eliminate the unknown parameters @xmath97 and @xmath99 , we obtain the following estimate of the cbs - limit total energy @xmath172 @xmath173    in table [ 3ptsext ] , we report the errors on the rsh+lrmp2 total energy , @xmath174 , obtained with the three - point extrapolation formula using either @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 ( @xmath178 ) or @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 ( @xmath182 ) , and we compare with the errors obtained with each cc - pv@xmath2z basis set from @xmath155 to @xmath145 ( @xmath183 ) . here again the errors are calculated with respect to the cc - pv6z total energy , for several values of the range - separation parameter @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 , and only valence excitations are included in the mp2 calculations .",
    "for all the systems studied the errors @xmath178 are less than 1.5 mhartree . for ne , n@xmath1 , and h@xmath1o , these @xmath178 errors are significantly smaller ( by a factor of about 3 to 15 ) than the errors @xmath187 obtained with the largest basis used for the extrapolation , and are overall comparable with the errors @xmath188 .",
    "thus , the three - point extrapolation formula with @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 provides a useful cbs extrapolation scheme for range - separated dft . except for he ,",
    "the errors @xmath182 are negative ( _ i.e. _  , the extrapolation overshoots the cbs limit ) and larger than the errors @xmath188 .",

    "we have also tested a more flexible extrapolation scheme where the rsh energy and the long - range mp2 correlation energy are exponentially extrapolated independently but we have not found significant differences . on the contrary , one may want to use a less flexible two - point extrapolation formula using a predetermined value for @xmath99 .",
    "the difficulty with such an approach is to choose the value of @xmath99 , which in principle should depend on the system , on the range - separated parameter @xmath15 , and on the long - range wave - function method used .",
    "for this reason , we do not consider two - point extrapolation schemes .",
    "we have studied in detail the basis convergence of range - separated dft .",
    "we have shown that the partial - wave expansion of the long - range wave function near the electron - electron coalescence converges exponentially with the maximal angular momentum @xmath0 .",
    "we have also demonstrated on four systems ( he , ne , n@xmath1 , and h@xmath1o ) that the long - range mp2 correlation energy converges exponentially with the cardinal number @xmath2 of the dunning basis sets cc - p(c)v@xmath2z .",
    "this contrasts with the slow @xmath4 convergence of the correlation energy for the standard case of the coulomb interaction .",
    "due to this exponential convergence , the extrapolation to the cbs limit is less necessary for range - separated dft than for standard correlated wave function methods .",
    "nevertheless , we have proposed a cbs extrapolation scheme for the total energy in range - separated dft based on an exponential formula using calculations from three cardinal numbers @xmath2 . for the systems",
    "studied , the extrapolation using @xmath192 gives an error on the total energy with respect to the estimated cbs limit which is always smaller than the error obtained with a single calculation at @xmath193 , and which is often comparable or smaller than the error obtained with a calculation at @xmath145 .",
    "we expect the same convergence behavior for range - separated dft methods in which the long - range part is treated by configuration interaction , coupled - cluster theory , random - phase approximations , or density - matrix functional theory .",
    "finally , it should be pointed out that this rapid convergence is obtained in spite of the fact that the dunning basis sets have been optimized for the case of the standard coulomb interaction .",
    "the construction of basis sets specially optimized for the case of the long - range interaction may give yet a faster and more systematic convergence .",
