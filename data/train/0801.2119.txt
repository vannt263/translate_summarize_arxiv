    "millimeter telescopes can provide a detailed picture of the distribution and kinematics of molecular gas in galaxy disks through extensive co line mapping .",
    "however , the use of tracers more specific to the dense molecular gas phase , the one directly involved in the fueling of star formation and agn episodes , is required to probe the feedback of activity on the ism . provided that high spatial resolution and high sensitivity requirements are met , the observation of complex molecular species can help to track down galaxy evolution .",
    "extragalactic chemistry can be used to challenge current chemical models of molecular gas , as active galaxies can drive chemical complexity on much larger scales compared to our galaxy .",
    "furthermore , this type of studies are a key to constrain conversion factors , which are required to derive gas masses from line luminosities .",
    "this is mostly relevant , as the excitation and chemistry of some of the more routinely used dense gas tracers ( e.g. , hcn lines ) can be heavily affected in active environments .",
    "different processes can shape the evolution of molecular gas along the typical evolutionary track of a starburst : large - scale shocks , strong uv - fields , cosmic - rays , and eventually x - rays , in the presence of an agn .",
    "these actors are expected to be at play at different stages but also at different locations in the disk and in the disk - halo interface of galaxies showing activity .",
    "the use of interferometers makes possible to unveil a strong chemical differentiation in the molecular gas disks of active galaxies .",
    "the example of m82 , a prototypical starburst , is paradigmatic in this respect .",
    "virtually all of the large - scale sio emission detected in the pdbi map of m  82 , published by garca - burillo  ( @xcite ) , traces the disk - halo interface of the galaxy where episodes of mass injection are building up the gaseous halo .",
    "in contrast , widespread emission of the formyl radical , hco , mapped in m  82 with the pdbi , reveals the propagation of photo - dissociation region ( pdr ) chemistry inside the disk of this starburst ( garca - burillo  @xcite ) .",
    "the scenario of a giant pdr in the disk of m  82 has received further support from the high abundances measured for molecular tracers specific to pdr such as cn , hoc@xmath4 , co@xmath4 as well as a set of small hydrocarbon chains ( fuente  @xcite ) .",
    ", against surface density of the dense molecular gas mass derived from hcn , @xmath5 , for normal galaxies ( open squares ) as well as lirgs , ulirgs and high - z objects ( filled squares ) .",
    "the solid line is the regression fit to the full sample of galaxies . in * ( b ) * and * ( c ) * we separate between normal and lirgs / ulirgs / high - z , respectively .",
    "the dashed ( dotted ) line is the fit to galaxies with @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "lower panels show the residuals of the fits .",
    "( adapted from graci - carpio  @xcite).,width=434 ]    there is increasing evidence that the excitation and the chemistry of molecular gas show significant differences between starbursts and agns ( e.g. , kohno  @xcite ; krips  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , krips  ( @xcite ) have recently shown that starbursts and agns populate different regions in a set of diagnostic diagrams that make use of hcn and hco@xmath4 line ratios .",
    "lvg fits to the observed ratios point to lower h@xmath8 densities and larger hcn abundances in agns compared to starburst galaxies .",
    "overluminous hcn lines ( possibly leading to overabundant hcn ) seem to be the rule in the circumnuclear disks ( cnd ) of many seyferts .",
    "the 200  pc - radius cnd of ngc  1068 is viewed as the first clear example of a giant x - ray dominated region ( xdr ) leading to enhanced abundances of some molecular species like hcn ( usero  @xcite ) .",
    "recently a high - resolution pdbi map has shown that strong sio emission comes from the cnd of ngc  1068 ( garca - burillo  2008 , in prep . ) .",
    "the enhancement of sio in this case can not be attributed to the action of ongoing star formation as there is negative evidence of a recent starburst in the cnd of ngc  1068 ( davies  @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , the processing of 10    dust grains by x - rays , as a mechanism to enhance silicon chemistry in gas phase , would explain the large sio abundances of the cnd . in particular , the inclusion of dust grain chemistry could solve the controversy between different gas - phase xdr schemes as concerns the abundance of some molecular tracers like hcn in x - ray irradiated environments .",
    "hco@xmath9(10 ) luminosity ratio as a function of @xmath10 in the sample of lirgs and ulirgs of graci - carpio  ( @xcite ) .",

    "we indicate the [ hcn]/[hco@xmath4 ] abundance ratios derived from multiline lvg analysis.,width=377 ]",
    "the caveats on the use of hcn as a tracer of dense gas in active galaxies call for the use of alternative tracers of dense gas in lirgs and ulirgs , galaxies where star formation and agn activity are expected to be highly embedded",
    ". this question is paramount to disentangle the power sources of the infrared luminosities of these galaxies . in a recent paper , graci - carpio  ( @xcite )",
    "have presented evidence that the @xmath12 ratio , taken as a fair proxy for the star formation efficiency of the dense gas ( sfe@xmath13 ) , is a factor @xmath1423 higher in ir luminous galaxies ( @xmath15 ) compared to normal galaxies .",
    "local universe lirgs and ulirgs populate a region in the sfe@xmath13 diagram that lies between those occupied by normal and high-@xmath16 ir luminous galaxies .",
    "the reported trend in the sfe@xmath13 derived from hcn data implies that there is a statistically significant turn upward in the kennicutt - schmidt law , @xmath17 , at high @xmath10 : @xmath18 changes from @xmath140.800.95 ( for @xmath19 ) to @xmath141.11.2 ( for @xmath15 ) ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "based on a multiline lvg analysis of hcn and hco@xmath9 data , that follows the survey published by graci - carpio  ( @xcite ) , graci - carpio  ( @xcite ) find that the the conversion factor between @xmath20 and m@xmath21 , @xmath22 , is @xmath143 times lower at high @xmath10 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "of particular note , a significant overabundance of hcn has also been reported in the ir luminous z@xmath144 quasar apm  08279 ( wagg  @xcite ; garca - burillo  @xcite ) .",
    "this reinforces the scenario where the sfe@xmath13 could well be an order of magnitude higher in extreme lirgs / ulirgs compared to normal galaxies ."
