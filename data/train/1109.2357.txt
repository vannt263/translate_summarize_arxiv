    "in many scenarios of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , the top quark provides a preferred search window due to its large coupling to the physics responsible for the electro - weak symmetry breaking . a fascinating possibility",
    "then is that the top quark properties exhibit deviations from their predictions within the sm .",
    "the leading such contributions are encoded in the anomalous top couplings to sm gauge fields affecting the top anomalous ( chromo)-electric and ( chromo)-magnetic dipole moments  @xcite , flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) couplings ( @xmath9 , where @xmath10 )  @xcite , as well as anomalous charged current interactions ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "precision studies of top quark properties are currently underway at the lhc and tevatron colliders and will complete our knowledge of possible new physics ( np ) effecting the properties and interactions of the sm particles .",
    "in particular , both tevatron  @xcite and lhc  @xcite experiments have recently presented precise measurements , sensitive to the top quark  @xmath12 boson ",
    "@xmath13 quark vertex ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "recently , we have reconsidered the @xmath14 helicity amplitudes in presence of anomalous @xmath8 interactions , including corrections due to perturbative qcd effects  @xcite , and found that some of the anomalous couplings are already being significantly constrained by the cdf and d measurements . in light of the first lhc results being able to provide constraints on possible anomalous @xmath8 couplings , a more recent study  @xcite has combined bounds coming from @xmath14 helicity amplitudes , angular asymmetries as well as single top production observables .    on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath8 vertex also plays an important role in @xmath15 physics , since fcnc processes involving @xmath13 quarks receive , within the sm , dominant contributions from loops involving a top quark and a @xmath12 boson . during the recent years",
    ", the @xmath15 factories , cdf and d experiments at the tevatron as well as lhcb at the lhc have proceeded to probe @xmath1 oscillation observables , as well as rare fcnc mediated @xmath15 decays with ever increasing precision .",
    "the first @xmath15 physics observable to be studied for the effects of the anomalous @xmath8 vertices was the @xmath16 decay rate  @xcite .",
    "the authors considered a complete basis of dimension six operators , free of tree - level fcncs . to simplify the analysis , they assumed alignment of the operator flavor structures with the sm ckm matrix , as well as the reality of the appropriate wilson coefficients .",
    "recently  @xcite , we have explored the possible presence of anomalous @xmath11 interactions in @xmath1 oscillations within a model independent approach based on the assumptions of minimal flavor violation ( mfv )  @xcite , which extends the basis of operator flavor structures considered in  @xcite .",
    "we have found that the @xmath17 mixing amplitudes can receive large contributions and that some of the possible operators can provide significant new sources of cp violation . in term , based on the recent global fits to neutral meson oscillation observables  @xcite , we have derived preferred ranges for the anomalous couplings , some of them being more constraining than both @xmath16 as well as direct measurements .    inspired by the fast progress in the field we extend our analysis of the anomalous @xmath11 vertices to rare ( semi)leptonic @xmath15 decays .",
    "again we rely on mfv in order to reduce the number of possible operator flavor structures , and we review the framework in sec .",
    "after performing the one - loop matching of our operator basis onto the low energy effective hamiltonian describing @xmath18 fcnc processes , we obtain corrections to the relevant wilson coefficients in sec .",
    "we proceed in sec .",
    "iv by calculating the effects in the inclusive @xmath19 and @xmath20 decays , cross - checking the existing calculation  @xcite in the former mode . in order to derive bounds on both the real and imaginary parts of the appropriate wilson coefficients we include the experimental results not only for the decay rates but also for the cp asymmetry in @xmath16 . after performing a global fit of the wilson coefficients , we derive predictions for several rare @xmath15 meson processes like @xmath6 , the forward - backward asymmetry ( fba ) in @xmath3 and the branching ratios for @xmath7 in sec . v. finally we conclude in sec . vi .",
    "we adopt the framework used in our previous work  @xcite , committing to an effective theory , described by the lagrangian @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the sm part , @xmath23 is the scale of np and @xmath24 are dimension - six operators , invariant under sm gauge transformations and consisting of sm fields .",
    "we assume that at the scale @xmath25 the sm fields with up to two higgs doublets are the only propagating degrees of freedom , that the electroweak symmetry is only broken by the vacuum expectation values of these two scalars and that operators up to dimension six give the most relevant contributions to the observables we consider .",
    "such an approach is appropriate to summarize weak scale effects of np at @xmath26 , where the new heavy degrees of freedom have been integrated out .",
    "our operator basis consists of all dimension - six operators that generate charged current quark interactions with the @xmath12 , but do not induce fcncs at the tree - level . since we restrict our discussion to mfv scenarios , lagrangian ( [ eq : lagr ] ) has to be formally invariant under the sm flavor group @xmath27 where @xmath28 stand for quark doublets and up and down type quark singlets respectively .",
    "mfv requires that the only @xmath29 symmetry breaking spurionic fields in the theory are the up and down quark yukawa matrices @xmath30 , formally transforming under @xmath29 as @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "we identify four relevant quark bilinears with distinct transformation properties under @xmath29 : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 transforming as @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively . using these",
