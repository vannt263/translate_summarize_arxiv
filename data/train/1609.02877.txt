    "candidate systems for quantum information processing must satisfy some basic requirements , among others are the capability to perform controlled logic gates and arbitrary rotations on one qubit .",

    "reiserer _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite demonstrated experimentally the realization of a controlled phase gate between the spin state of a single @xmath1 atom and the polarization state of a photon .",
    "the atom - photon quantum gate is performed in the strong - coupling regime of the atom - cavity system ( i.e. , when the atom - field coupling is much stronger than the atomic and cavity dissipation rates ) , providing the possibility to generate entanglement between atom - photon and , between atom and two photons .",

    "here we investigate theoretically three schemes for the implementation of quantum phase gates in a physical system constituted by a single trapped atom inside an optical cavity",
    ". the atomic system can be modelled by a three - level atom in a @xmath2-level configuration .",
    "the key mechanism for the phase gate implementation is the cavity - eit effect , i. e. , a phase shift of @xmath0 can be imprinted on the probe field ( target qubit ) in the strong - coupling regime , if the classical control field is on or off .",
    "it happens because the phase of the input field experiences @xmath0 phase shift when it is immediately reflected ( which can happen when the classical control field is off ) but there is no change in the phase of the input field when it enters and then is transmitted by the cavity .",
    "this last situation can happen in the cavity - eit regime , when the classical control field is on , making the atom - cavity system transparent to the probe field . here , firstly we demonstrated that based on cavity - eit effect , the control field , described in our model as a classical field , can induce a phase on the probe field .",
    "we analyse the set of parameters the phase gate can be implemented for a classical probe field or considering a single photon . combining a quantum memory process based on cavity - eit effect and the basic mechanism of the phase shift induced due to reflection of the input light",
    ", we also investigate the implementation of a quantum logic gate between two single photons . in this case , a control photon is stored into atomic states and , depending on the coupling strength between atom - cavity , the phase gate is efficiently performed on the target photon ( probe pulse ) . here",
    "we discuss the performance of the phase gates as a function of the system parameters and we show that there is a lower bound for the cooperativity of the atom - cavity system which allows the implementation of the photon - photon phase gate .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we discuss the physical system and model . section [ sec:3 ] is devoted to show the implementation of the quantum phase gate considering a classical probe field and single photons .",
    "we also analyse the performance of the phase gate as a function of the system parameters .",
    "section [ sec:4 ] presents concluding remarks .",
    "here we investigate the implementation of quantum phase gate in different ways considering a system composed by a three - level atom in a @xmath2-configuration , inside a single - sided optical cavity .",
    "the ground @xmath3 and excited @xmath4 atomic states ( transition frequency @xmath5 ) are coupled by the cavity mode ( frequency @xmath6 ) , with @xmath7 representing such atom - field coupling ( single photon rabi frequency ) .",
    "the levels @xmath8 and @xmath4 ( transition frequency @xmath9 ) are coupled by a classical control field ( frequency @xmath10 ) with rabi frequency @xmath11 . as the maximum efficiencies for our quantum gates happen for the resonant case , throughout of this work we assume @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the single - sided cavity configuration denotes a cavity in which one of its mirror is perfectly reflective while the other one has non null transmission coefficient . in this way",
    ", the incident field can only enter and exit by one side of the cavity . in our model",
    "this setup corresponds to the condition where @xmath14 , being @xmath15 and @xmath16 the cavity field decay rates associated to each one of the cavity mirrors ( in the ideal situation @xmath17 ) .",
    "considering the rotating wave approximation , the hamiltonian that describes the atom - cavity system under the incidence of the control and the probe fields ( without temporal dependency ) , is given in the interaction picture by ( @xmath18 ) @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 represents the detuning between the cavity mode and the probe field ( @xmath21 ) frequencies .",
    "the atomic operators are represented by @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 stands for hermitian conjugate .",
    "the operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 are associated to the internal cavity mode .",
    "the pumping on the cavity through the probe laser is represented by the strength @xmath27 . in relation to the atom - cavity coupling @xmath7",
    ", it is important to point out that we do not take into account oscillations of the atom in the cavity , considering in all our results a constant coupling @xmath7 .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to investigate theoretically the implementation of a quantum logic gate where a field induces a phase shift of @xmath0 on another one .",
    "thus , considering the atom - cavity system under the incidence of a classical control field we show the implementation of a quantum gate for three different situations , i.e. , when : ( i ) the probe and control fields are treated classically ; ( ii ) the control field is classical while the probe field is a single photon with its temporal shape described by a gaussian pulse ; ( iii ) a target photon has its phase changed by a amount of @xmath0 if a control photon is successfully stored into the atomic states . in the last case ,",
    "as it will be explained later , the classical control field has a suitable temporal shape which ensures the memory process has efficiency close to @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the master equation that governs the dynamics of the atom - cavity system is given by    @xmath29+\\kappa ( 2a\\rho a^{\\dagger } -a^{\\dagger } a\\rho -\\rho a^{\\dagger } a ) \\\\",
    "& + \\sum_{i=1,2}\\gamma _ { 3i}(2\\sigma _ { i3}\\rho",

    "the equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) provides the dynamics of the internal cavity mode , represented by the annihilation operator @xmath33 , which is related to the external mode operators by the input - output expression : @xmath34 where the operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 describe the incoming and outgoing fields , respectively , for a single - sided cavity whose field decays at a rate @xmath15 .",
    "we compute the phase of the outgoing mode field @xmath36 simply by @xmath37 being @xmath38 the phase acquired by the field after having been reflected or transmitted by the cavity .    in all these cases ,",
    "the key ingredient for the gate implementation is the cavity - eit effect .",
    "as it is well known , under the eit regime , @xmath39 , being @xmath40 , the atom - cavity system is transparent to the probe laser when it is resonant with the cavity mode ( @xmath41 ) . in this way",
    ", when the input field impinges on the cavity mirror it can enter into the resonator and then it will be transmitted . on the other hand ,",
    "if the external control field is off and the atom is in the ground state @xmath3 , the input pulse is directly reflected due to the normal mode splitting of the atom - cavity system , thus enabling the implementation of the quantum phase gate @xcite .",
    "firstly we analyse the phase shift induced by a control laser on a continuous coherent probe field . considering the atom - cavity system in the single - sided configuration described on previous section , if the classical control field is turned off , only the atomic levels @xmath3 and @xmath4 take part in the dynamics , reducing the system to a two - level atom - cavity one ( in this case we assume the characteristic times and intensity of the probe field such that the atomic decay from @xmath42 to @xmath43 does not play important role in the dynamics of the system ) .",
    "thus , according to the jaynes - cummings model , in the strong coupling regime ( @xmath44 ) the resonant photons ( @xmath45 ) that impinge onto the system do not enter the cavity .",
    "this happens due to the normal mode splitting caused by the atom - cavity coupling .",
    "then , the probe laser that is resonant with the transition @xmath46 and with the cavity mode is directly reflected by the left mirror , acquiring a @xmath0 phase shift .",
    "conversely , if the control laser couples resonantly the @xmath47 transition , the probe laser enters the cavity .",
    "as we are in the eit condition , the field is not absorbed by the atom and then is transmitted without experiencing any change in its phase .",
    "therefore , in this experimental setup , the control laser has an important role to induce a phase difference between the reflected and transmitted fields , such that @xmath48 , when the probe laser is resonant with the cavity mode .",
    "fig.[fig:1](a ) shows the diagram of atomic levels and fig.[fig:1](b ) shows a schematic representation of the implementation of the phase gate with a classical field ( control field ) inducing a @xmath0 phase shift in another field .        in the hamiltonian system the pumping on the cavity",
    "is represented by the parameter @xmath27 .",
    "the connection between the master equation formalism and the input - output theory is given by the relation @xmath49 for a coherent driving field .",

    "( b ) phase shift ( @xmath53 ) of the probe laser ( solid blue line ) and the normalized mean number of photons inside the cavity for @xmath52 ( dashed red line ) and , for @xmath51 ( dotted black line ) .",
    "the parameters used here were : @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . ]    considering a weak coherent probe field @xmath57 , we plot in the fig.[fig:2 ] ( a ) the acquired phase @xmath38 by the probe field , in @xmath0 units as function of the detuning @xmath58 , when the control laser is turned off ( dotted black line ) and when the system is in the cavity - eit regime ( dashed red line ) , considering a strong coupling regime @xmath59 and @xmath54 . in the panel [ fig:2 ] ( b )",
    "are plotted the phase difference @xmath60 induced by the classical control field ( solid blue line ) and the normalized mean number of photons inside the cavity ( @xmath61 ) , for @xmath52 ( dashed red line ) and @xmath51 ( dotted black line ) .",
    "when the classical control field is off ( @xmath51 ) , the atom - cavity coupling makes the splitting of the normal modes of the system , resulting in two peaks in the transmission spectrum .",
    "this signature of the atom - cavity coupling can also be observed in the fig.[fig:2](a ) , where probe field phase is abruptly changed at @xmath62 . as mentioned previously , for @xmath63 and @xmath45 the probe field",
    "is directly reflected experiencing a conditional phase shift of @xmath0 . under these conditions @xmath64 .",
    "in the eit regime ( @xmath65 ) the probe field , at @xmath45 , enters the cavity and then is transmitted , without changing its phase , such that , @xmath66 . in this way , when the probe laser is resonant with the cavity mode , the phase shift is exactly @xmath67 . in the fig.[fig:2](b )",
    "the eit regime and absorption regions due the mode splitting can be clearly evidenced in the regions around @xmath41 and @xmath68 , respectively . in the regions around the normal mode",
    "splitting we also can see phase difference of the order of @xmath0 , but in this case the acquired phase is followed by a strong atomic absorption of the probe field , thus not preserving the initial probe field properties .",
    "it is important to mention that measurements of the field intensity in this setup can not distinguish the reflected and transmitted fields , since they are detected on the same side of the cavity .",
    "for this reason , one way to properly observe the eit phenomenon signature in one - sided cavity system could be through phase measurements instead of the usual spectrum transmission measurements @xcite .    _ phase gate for single photons : _ considering the same principle of phase shift in a classical probe field induced by the classical control field , now we analyse the implementation of the phase gate for single photons .",
    "unlike the situation described previously , the probe field incoming to the cavity is a single photon with its amplitude written as a wave packet given , without loss of generality , by the gaussian temporal shape : @xmath69where its full width at half maximum ( @xmath70 ) is given by @xmath71 .",
    "the multiplicative factor @xmath72 , ensures that gaussian function is normalized , such that @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 is the time the pulse ( its maximum ) enters the cavity .    due to the atom - cavity coupling , the incidence of the external control field , and probe field with at most one single photon",

    "in fact , considering the same procedure used in @xcite , the evolution of the probability amplitudes of the state vector written in the basis above is given by the following system of equations :    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is total decay rate of the excited state @xmath42 .",
    "in this description the temporal evolution of the amplitude of the internal cavity mode is provided by @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( with @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) the amplitude coefficients associated to other atom - cavity states @xmath85 .",

    "the solid black line represents the normalized input pulse .",
    "the parameters of the probe pulse considered for these results were : @xmath92s and @xmath91 .",
    "as we are interested in the implementation and optimization of the phase gate for the atom - cavity system based on cavity - eit effect , we consider the probe pulse on resonance with the cavity mode ( @xmath41 ) . for strong atom - field coupling regime ,",
    "when the classical control field is off the probe pulse is directly reflected without entering the cavity , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( dotted - dashed gray line ) . in this case",
    ", the outgoing field @xmath86 has exactly the gaussian shape of the input field , but with the phase difference of @xmath0 in relation to the incident pulse .",
    "for the set of parameters considered here , when the classical control field is on , the system is in the cavity - eit regime . in this context",
    "it is important to remind that the width of eit window depends directly on the rate @xmath94 @xcite . in fig.[fig:3 ]",
    "the atom - cavity coupling was kept fixed as @xmath90 . in this way",
    ", the width of the transparency window ( @xmath95 ) is different for each value of the external control field , as can be seen on the inset of fig.[fig:3 ] .",
    "the inset shows the probe field in frequency domain ( solid black line ) and the transparency window around the resonance region for @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "when @xmath87 ( dashed red line ) the eit window @xmath95 is such that the probe pulse does not fit well inside the eit window . in this way , part of the probe field",
    "is directly reflected , being represented by the gray area showed in the inset .",
    "however , as the system is in the eit regime , the remaining part of the pulse enters , interact with the atom and then is transmitted without changing its phase . for this case , the outgoing cavity field has a negative part associated to the reflected light exhibiting a phase shift of @xmath0 , and a positive part corresponding to the transmitted light .",
    "so , this external control field intensity is not strong enough to give rise to phase difference ( when the control field is on and off ) of @xmath0 on the whole pulse . on the order hand ,",
    "when @xmath88 ( dotted blue line ) the spectrum of the single photon pulse is entirely within the eit window .",
    "thus , as can be observed on the dotted blue curve in fig.[fig:3 ] , the outgoing field is transmitted without changing its phase , but a little delayed in relation to the input field .",
    "this delay occurs due two reasons : the spent time by the light to enters the cavity and to interact with the system and the slow - down of the group velocity that the incoming field undergoes due to eit effect @xcite .",
    "_ phase gate between two single photons : _ in the following we show how our experimental setup can be used to implement a controlled phase gate between two single photons and investigate its optimization in terms of the parameters of the system .",
    "our proposal consists of a control single photon pulse which can imprint a @xmath0 phase shift on another single photon field ( target pulse ) . to this end",
    ", the first single photon must be successfully stored in the atomic states .",
    "then , the second photon will experience a phase shift depending on whether the first photon was stored or not .",
    "thus , the success of our protocol depends on i ) the efficiency of the quantum memory process ( for the control photon ) and , ii ) the capability of the atom - cavity system to induce a phase shift on the second ( target ) photon .",
    "it is important to mention a similar protocol was used in @xcite to induce a phase shift on a target photon , but with the control photon being stored in an atomic ensemble in free space .    in our model we assume , without loss of generality , both the target and the control pulses as single photons with their wave packet given by the gaussian function ( [ eq:5 ] ) . in this case , the control and target pulses ( single photons ) have both the temporal shape such that , @xmath96 ( where the indexes @xmath97 and @xmath98 refer to control and target pulses , respectively )",
    "it is important to stress that our scheme is different from the one presented in @xcite , which does not require the storage of the control photon but , needs detection and manipulation of the atomic states .",
    "also , with our scheme , as the control photon must be stored in the atomic states , it can be used subsequently to induce phase shift on any number of target photons , without applying any operation / detection on the atomic states , being limited to the time the atomic system can keep the control photon stored . thus ,",
    "compared with the scheme presented in @xcite , our scheme has the disadvantage of requiring a memory process , but has the advantage of not involving detection / manipulation of the atomic states .",
    "\\i ) memory process for the control photon : quantum memory based on cavity - eit effect has already been extensively investigated in theoretical and experimental works .",
    "the basic idea of the quantum memory process in this context is to store the photonic qubit , for instance , polarization states of the light or a coherent superposition of @xmath99 and @xmath100 photon , in atomic ground states .",
    "thus , through the appropriate temporal shape of a classical field @xmath101 ( control field in cavity - eit ) , it is possible to storage the information encoded in the input pulse into the ground atomic states @xmath102 and @xmath43 . in a previous work , we studied in detail the atom - cavity system under the eit regime @xcite . among the results , we showed how to optimize the memory efficiency value for close to @xmath28 , for a single - sided cavity setup when a _ weak coherent pulse _ is sent . in that case",
    "it was not possible to apply the impedance matching algoritm derived by dilley _",
    "@xcite since it is valid for single photon pulses .",
    "now , as we are interested in the implementation of a quantum phase gate between single photons , the protocol derived by dilley _",
    "@xcite becomes very convenient since it allows the derivation of specific forms for the classical field @xmath101 for each input field @xmath103 . in their scheme ,",
    "the expression of the @xmath101 is obtained for a given input field after imposing an impedance matching condition , which consist to assume the total cancellation of the outgoing field of the cavity ( @xmath104 ) , due to a destructive interference process between the reflected and transmitted fields .",
    "thus , from the equation system ( [ eq:6 ] ) , we derive a temporal form to @xmath101 for a single photon described by a gaussian pulse , whose temporal shape is showed in the fig.[fig:4](a ) ( dotted - dashed black line ) for an atom - field coupling @xmath90 , for illustration .",
    "fig.[fig:4](a ) also shows the time sequence of the normalized control and target photon pulses ( red dashed and blue solid lines , respectively ) .    ,",
    "derived from phase matching condition and equations ( [ eq:6 ] ) ( dotted - dashed black line ) and time sequence in which the control ( red dashed line ) and target ( blue solid line ) single - photon pulses are sent .",
    "the target photon is delayed @xmath105 in relation to the control photon .",
    "( b ) probabilities @xmath106 and @xmath107 of finding the atom in the state @xmath3 and @xmath8 , respectively , as a function of cooperativity @xmath97 after the storage process of the control photon .",
    "the parameters used here were : @xmath54 , @xmath91 . ]",
    "it is important remind that , in the cavity - eit regime , the dark - state of the system is given by the superposition @xmath108 being @xmath109 .",
    "thus , in our scheme the state vector of the system @xmath110 can evolute from the state @xmath76 to @xmath77 with a given probability , without undergoing the excited state @xmath78 , if the the storage process is performed so that the classical control field is turned off adiabatically .",
    "the temporal form of the @xmath11 derived from the phase matching condition ( fig.[fig:4](a ) has all necessary requirements to optimize the storage process .",
    "thus , after the realization of the storage process of the first photon ( control photon ) one has two possibilities : the atom has absorbed the control photon , so the system state is @xmath77 ( when the memory process is perfectly accomplished ) , or the atom does not absorb the control photon , leaving the system in the state @xmath76 and then , through cavity decay process , goes to @xmath75 . in this way",
    ", there is a probability @xmath107 ( @xmath106 ) of finding the system in the state @xmath77 ( @xmath75 ) , which in turn is exactly the efficiency of the memory process . in the fig.[fig:4](b ) are plotted the probabilities @xmath106 and @xmath107 as a function of the cooperativity of the atom - cavity system @xmath111 , when the control photon is sent . as it was mentioned in the ref.@xcite ,",
    "the procedure used to derive the temporal form of the classical control field is not valid in the limit @xmath112 .",
    "thus , in our simulations we consider values of @xmath7 coupling in which the protocol used does not fail , i.e. , @xmath113 . for high values of @xmath97 ,",
    "the first photon is stored with an efficiency close to @xmath28 , preparing the atom in the state @xmath8 , which is not coupled to the cavity mode .",
    "thus , for the strong - coupling regime , when there is one photon on the control pulse , the target pulse enters the cavity and then , is transmitted without changing its phase .",
    "\\ii ) phase shift acquired by the target photon : in the next step of our protocol , a target photon must impinge on the atom - cavity system .",
    "if there was a single photon on the control photon and it was perfectly stored in the atomic system , its final state will be @xmath43 , being decoupled from the cavity mode . otherwise , if there was no control photon ( or , equivalently , if its polarization is such that it does not couple the atomic transition @xmath46 ) the final atomic state will be @xmath102 .",
    "thus , in the strong atom - field coupling regime and keeping the classical control field off ( @xmath114 , when the atom is in the state @xmath3 ( @xmath8 ) , the target photon is immediately reflected ( transmitted ) by the cavity , acquiring a phase shift @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) .",

    "it is impossible to perform the phase gate since the target photon is always transmitted , i.e. , the atom - cavity system can not induce a phase shift on it depending on the atomic state ( @xmath3 or @xmath8 ) . for @xmath120",
    "all the light from the target pulse is scattered by the atom , making this value a lower bound for the phase gate implementation . in fact , this specific value in which the system scatters all the light can be derived from a calculation of an effective decay and from the analysis of equations obtained in the steady regime , as it was explained in our previous paper @xcite . for @xmath121 part of the light",
    "is immediately reflected , acquiring a phase shift of @xmath0 , and part enters the cavity and then is scattered by the atom .",
    "this means that , when the target photon is not lost ( due to atomic scattering ) , it will acquire a phase shift depending on the atomic state , i.e. , @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) for @xmath3 ( @xmath8 ) , thus performing the phase gate .",
    "however , as in some events the target photon will be lost , we end up with probability of success of our phase gate @xmath124 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:5](c ) we plot the average number of photons outside the cavity as a function of the cooperativity @xmath97 .",
    "as the input target pulse contains just a single photon , the average number of photons is exactly the probability of having one photon in the outgoing field when the atom is in the state @xmath102 , i.e. , @xmath125 . in fig .",

    "therefore , only outside the dark region a significant part of the input light is recovered . in this way ,",

    "we have shown that for cooperativity @xmath138 a great part of the target photon is scattered by the atom , losing information and imposing limitations on the phase gate . however , even for @xmath138 but for @xmath139 , when the target photons are not scattered by the atom , they will certainly acquire a @xmath0 phase shift depending on the atomic state , thus introducing a probabilistic aspect to the phase gate . in this way , the value @xmath139 represents a lower bound for the cooperativity of the atom - cavity system which enables the implementation of phase shift on single photons . in general , this work demonstrates the great feasibility to avail all the advantages that the atom - cavity system provides to implement quantum logic operations , enabling numerous applications in the area of quantum processing information .",
