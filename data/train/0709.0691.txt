    "none of the above mentioned observational channels is sensitive to dynamical galaxy parameters , such as the distribution of stellar orbits .",
    "dynamical modelling of stellar kinematics has the unique advantage that it allows reconstruction of both the mass structure and the orbital state of a galaxy .",
    "high - quality observations of the line - of - sight velocity distributions ( losvds ) out to several @xmath4 are needed for this purpose . to overcome the problems of measuring absorption line kinematics in the faint outskirts of ellipticals , discrete kinematical tracers such as planetary nebulae or globular",
    "clusters can be used to additionally constrain the mass distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "since stars in galaxies behave collisionlessly to first order , the distribution of stellar orbits is not known a priori and very general dynamical methods are required to probe all the degrees of freedom in the orbital system .",
    "so far only one large sample of 21 round , non - rotating giant ellipticals has been probed for dark matter considering at least the full range of _ spherical _ models @xcite .",

    "the dilemma as to the choice of @xmath36 in such cases could be solved by adjusting the function @xmath37 appropriately .    for the coma galaxy modelling we use the same regularisation for all galaxies : @xmath38 and the entropy of equation ( [ bentropy ] ) .",

    "[ modtable ] .",
    "this is surprising at first sight because if galaxies are oriented randomly then one would expect only about 6 out of 17 objects to have inclinations larger than @xmath83 . omitting the five systems for which only edge - on models were calculated ( gmp0756 , gmp1176 , gmp1990 , gmp2417 and gmp5975 ; cf .",
    "[ subsec : depro ] ) and taking into account the uncertainties quoted in tab .",
    "[ modtable ] there are 3 galaxies out of 11 where inclinations @xmath84 are ruled out by our modelling ( at the 68 percent confidence level ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with the expectation for random inclinations .",
    "nevertheless , we now discuss a little more whether our modelling might be subject to a slight inclination bias .",
    "first , one possible issue is that using the same regularisation for all galaxies might introduce a subtle bias towards edge - on configurations .",
    "consider a rotating system : the lower the assumed inclination of the model the larger its intrinsic rotation needs to be in order to match the observations after projection .",
    "thus , the system will be dynamically colder and its entropy will be lower . turning the argument around : usage of a constant @xmath36",
    "enforces the same weight on entropy in the inclined model as in the edge - on model .",

    "this might drive models of rotating galaxies towards @xmath85 .",
    "we do not expect this to affect conclusions drawn from our modelling results strongly , because , as it has been argued in sec .",
    "[ subsec : depro ] , error bars on intrinsic properties include in many cases models at different inclinations , even extreme cases .",

    "[ dattable ] ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : shape ] ) is still shifted slightly towards higher ellipticities with respect to the bright ellipticals of @xcite . in combination with the lack of round objects in our sample ,",

    "fourth , even assuming our sample galaxies are at random inclinations and that the first two just discussed points are irrelevant ( regularisation and noise ) and that inclinations can be reconstructed uniquely from ideal data with ideal models then we still could be faced with a slight bias in our models : as it has been described in sec .",
    "[ subsec : depro ] we do not probe a fine grid in inclinations but look for extreme cases .",
    "our models provide for each galaxy only the choice between edge - on or intrinsically e5/e7 , respectively . since an intrinsic e5/e7 shape is a rather extreme assumption this might drive the modelling towards the edge - on option as well .",

    "[ fig : shape ] has relatively more galaxies on the flatter side of the peak and relatively fewer galaxies on the rounder side .",
    "now , if the modelling would be subject to a strong bias towards @xmath94 then we would expect the opposite : an overestimation of intrinsically roundish galaxies .",
    "thus , the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : shape ] argues against a strong modelling bias towards high inclinations .",
    "however , the argument is not conclusive , because the sample itself maybe biased against apparently round galaxies .",
    "this could partly compensate for an inclination bias in the modelling .    in conclusion",
    ", although there might be a slight inclination bias in the modelling and/or the sample galaxies , fig .",
    "[ fig : shape ] reveals that either this bias is not very strong , or that modelling and sample biases roughly counterbalance each other .",

    "[ modtable ] , the best - fit model of each galaxy contains a dark matter halo .",
    "column ( 14 ) of the table states that eight galaxies have at least a two sigma detection of a dark matter halo ( gmp0282 , gmp0756 , gmp1176 , gmp1750 , gmp2440 , gmp4928 , gmp5568 and gmp5975 ) . the best fitting models with and without dark matter , respectively ,",

    "it follows that models without a halo obviously fail to reproduce the kinematic data for the above mentioned galaxies .",
    "the evidence for dark matter thereby comes mostly from the innermost and outermost kinematic data points : without dark matter , the energy of the models is too low , when compared to the data at large radii and too high , when compared to the central data ( for example illustrated by the dispersion profile of gmp5975 ) .",
    "the reason for the differences at small radii is likely that part of the missing outer mass in models without a halo is compensated for by a larger mass - to - light ratio ( cf .",
    "[ subsec : mtols ] ) .",
    "this , in turn , causes an increase of the central mass and central velocity dispersion , respectively . in gmp1750",
    "the dispersion profile without dark matter fits systematically worse than the one with dark matter at all radii .",

    "gmp1990 , gmp2417 , gmp3329 and gmp3792 the evidence for dark matter is generally low .",

    "constant mass - to - light ratios have been reported to be consistent with planetary nebulae kinematics in the outskirts of three roundish objects ( spherical modelling ; @xcite ) . also some of the round and non - rotating ellipticals of @xcite are consistent with the mass distribution following the light distribution .",
    "many of these latter systems lack of kinematic data beyond @xmath4 , however .",
    "in addition to the related uncertainties for the outer dark halo , spherical modelling of round galaxies generally suffers from the ambiguity related to the flattening along the line - of - sight . in this sense",
    ", gmp1990 is an interesting case , because its apparent flattening implies a viewing - angle close to @xmath85 and the kinematic data extend relatively far out ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "best - fit dark matter halos are in 4 out of 17 cases of the nfw - type and in all other cases logarithmic .",
    "differences in the goodness - of - fit based on one or the other halo family are marginal in most cases .",
    "central dark matter densities are at least one to two orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding mass densities in stars . between 10 and 50 percent of the mass inside the half - light radius @xmath4 is formally dark in most coma galaxies .",
    "these dark matter fractions are in general agreement with earlier results of dark matter modelling in round , non - rotating ellipticals @xcite as well as with the analysis of cold gas kinematics @xcite , hot halo gas @xcite and strong lensing studies @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded for similar dark matter fractions in the sauron - ellipticals ( although in their models it is assumed that mass follows light ) .    the combination of luminous and dark matter results in circular velocity curves of various shapes : some galaxies have outer decreasing @xmath98 while others show an indication for a dip in @xmath98 around @xmath165 and a subsequent increase of @xmath98 towards larger radii .",
    "we can not easily quantify the significance of this dip .",
    "its appearance close to the outermost kinematic radius is suspicious to reflect a modelling artifact .",
    "however , in contrast to the orbital structure , whose reconstruction becomes uncertain around ( and beyond ) the last kinematic data point @xcite , the mass reconstruction in these regions is more robust @xcite .",
    "in addition , the dip does not appear in all galaxies , suggesting that it is related to some observable property of the corresponding objects . in any case , it is interesting to note that similar dips are also indicated in temperature profiles of elliptical galaxy x - ray halos @xcite and can also been seen in spherical models of some round galaxies @xcite . more extended kinematic data sets may in the future allow to better constrain the outer shape of the circular velocity curve .    in rotating systems",
    "the circular velocity is fairly constant over the observationally sampled radial region ( 10 percent fractional variation ) .",
    "similarly flat circular velocity curves have also been inferred from stellar kinematics of round systems ( spherical modelling ; @xcite ) and from strong gravitational lensing @xcite .    to the resolution of our orbit models",
    "all dark halos are supported by at least one positive definite phase - space distribution function . in case of nfw - halos smooth dfs",
    "can be constructed , but for log - halos with large core radii even the maximisation of orbital entropy does not yield smooth dfs .",
    "it is not obvious whether the corresponding spatial density profiles are stable or not .",
    "further modelling is required to investigate whether phase - space arguments can be used to rule out logarithmic halos in elliptical galaxies .      with decreasing total mass the influence of rotation on the stellar phase - space distribution increases .",
    "in many galaxies rotation arises by an overpopulation of prograde orbits and a simultaneous underpopulation of retrograde orbits .",
    "at least one system lacks of the depopulation of retrograde orbits , proving that it is not a general artifact of our modelling approach .",
    "some galaxies show strong tangential anisotropy along the minor - axis .",
    "this derives from low minor - axis @xmath3-measurements , because observed @xmath3 and modelled orbital anisotropy along the minor - axis turn out to be correlated .",
    "slope and zero - point of this correlation are largely independent of regularisation , but  to some degree  stronger regularisation tightens the relation .",
    "such a relation between an intrinsic quantity on the one hand and an observed one on the other can not originate from the entropy maximisation alone .    along the major - axis ,",
    "a slight tendency of increasing @xmath108 with increasing @xmath3 is noticeable , but with much larger scatter than along the minor - axis .",
    "only one system shows indication of tangential anisotropy ( @xmath112 ) , all other galaxies are isotropic or mildly radially anisotropic ( @xmath166 , @xmath167 ) .",
    "radial anisotropy also appears characteristic for spherical models of round galaxies @xcite .",
    "a suppression of vertical energy ( corresponding to @xmath166 ) has recently been reported for sauron ellipticals @xcite .",
    "we plan a detailed investigation of the orbital structure of the coma galaxies for the future .",
    "stellar mass - to - light ratios , dark matter fractions and the shape of circular velocity curves turn out to be robust against different choices of the regularisation parameter @xmath36 . the strongest effect @xmath36 has is on the reconstructed anisotropies : their absolute values tend to increase if the weight on regularisation constraints is lowered .",
    "at a fixed radius the dependency of anisotropy on @xmath36 is mostly monotonic , such that the general quality of a galaxy to be radially or tangentially anisotropic , respectively , is independent of @xmath36 .",
    "what changes instead is the actual amount of anisotropy .",
    "detailed investigations of luminous and dark matter scaling relations , of stellar population properties and their connection to the phase - space distribution of orbits are in preparation .",
