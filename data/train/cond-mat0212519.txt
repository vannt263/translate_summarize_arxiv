    "no other universal quantity has been computed exactly so far . in our contribution we will improve the situation and explain how to extract the scaling function for the stationary two - point function .",
    "a few other universal quantities can be computed as well .",

    "is solved numerically .",
    "such computations are repeated in @xcite with greatly improved precision and using a more convenient set of coordinates .",
    "thus for the 1d kpz equation we are in the unique position of an exact solution and an accurate numerical solution to the mode - coupling equation with _ no _ adjustable parameters . as will be explained below , given the uncontrolled approximation , mode - coupling does surprisingly well .    to attack ( [ eq : kpz1d ] ) directly",
    "does not seem to be feasible , a situation which is rather similar to the one for two - dimensional models in equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
