    "current cosmological observations are now very precise to give us much information about the early universe . in particular , from observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) such as wmap @xcite , we can probe the physics of the early universe through the nature of primordial fluctuations , which are usually characterized by the amplitude of the fluctuations and its scale dependence as well as by a possible contribution of gravity waves . recently in addition to these quantities , non - gaussianity has been attracting much attention since it provides information about different aspects of the physics of the early universe .",
    "non - gaussianity is usually quantified by the so - called non - linearity parameter @xmath0 and the recent constraint on this quantity from wmap5 is @xcitehere @xmath0 represents the so - called `` local type '' non - gaussianity . in this letter , we only consider non - gaussianity of this type .",
    "@xmath6 although the data is still consistent with gaussian fluctuation , which corresponds to @xmath7 , the central value is away from zero as @xmath8 .",
    "if future observations confirm such non - zero large value of @xmath0 , it will give very important implications to the scenario of the early universe ; a simple model of inflation would be excluded since fluctuations from the inflaton are almost gaussian . in such a case , some mechanism is needed to generate large non - gaussian fluctuations .",
    "importantly , the simple inflationary scenario is not the only possibility to generate the density fluctuations . in particular , from the viewpoint of particle physics , there may exist a scalar field other than the inflaton , i.e. , so - called the curvaton @xcite , which acquires primordial fluctuation and generate the present density fluctuations although it is a sub - dominant component during inflation . with the curvaton , large non - gaussianity can also be generated @xcite , some other models generating large non - gaussianity have also been discussed , such as the modulated reheating scenario @xcite .",
    "and the curvaton scenario seems attractive in the light of constructing a successful model of generating large non - gaussianity .    in order to generate large non - gaussianity with the curvaton ,",
    "it is necessary that the energy density of the curvaton at the time of its decay should be much smaller than that of the dominant component of the universe ( which is expected to be from the inflaton ) .",
    "density fluctuations generated in such a scenario are ( almost ) scale - invariant , and hence can be consistent with the observations if the fluctuations of all the components are adiabatic . however , in such a scenario , there exist entropy fluctuations between components from the inflaton and those from the curvaton . in order to have vanishing isocurvature fluctuations ,",
    "it is necessary to generate baryon asymmetry and cold dark matter ( cdm ) at low - temperature universe after the decay of the curvaton .",
    "although there are several possibilities that the dark - matter density is determined at a relatively low temperature , such as axion dark matter , the lightest superparticle dark matter and so on , baryogenesis at a low temperature may be challenging .",
    "indeed , for some of the scenarios of baryogenesis , like the thermal @xcite and non - thermal @xcite leptogenesis , a relatively high cosmic temperature is required.however , the electroweak baryogenesis @xcite may be a possibility .",
    "another possible model is affleck - dine baryogenesis @xcite and the issues of non - gaussianity in the model is discussed in @xcite .",
    "this fact indicates that , to realize large non - gaussianity , it may be necessary to generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe before the decay of the curvaton .",
    "since the size of baryonic isocurvature fluctuations is now severely constrained by observations , such constraints are important in considering baryogenesis in the curvaton scenario generating large non - gaussianity .",
    "in particular , in the simplest curvaton scenario where the cosmic density fluctuations are totally from the primordial fluctuation of the curvaton , large non - gaussianity can not be generated without conflicting with the constraints from the baryonic isocurvature fluctuations if the baryon asymmetry is solely from the decay product of the inflaton .",
    "this argument excludes some of the scenarios of baryogenesis which require high cosmic temperature in the curvaton scenario .",
    "however , in the mixed fluctuation scenario where fluctuations from the inflaton and the curvaton both contribute to cosmic density fluctuations @xcite , the situation changes ; even if the baryon number of the universe originates only from the decay products of the inflaton , the amplitude of isocurvature fluctuations relative to adiabatic ones can be suppressed .",
    "thus , in such a case , large non - gaussianity may be generated without conflicting with the constraint on the isocurvature fluctuations .    in this letter",
    ", we discuss non - gaussianity and baryonic isocurvature fluctuations in the curvaton scenario where only the decay products of the inflaton are responsible for the baryogenesis .",
    "we pay particular attention to the question how large @xmath0 can be while imposing the isocurvature constraints .",
    "we will see that @xmath9 can be realized even if severe constraints on isocurvature fluctuations are imposed .",
    "we first describe the scenario we consider in this letter and summarize formulae to calculate density fluctuations and its non - gaussianity .    here , we consider the curvaton scenario where fluctuations from the inflaton also contribute to the total curvature fluctuations along with that from the curvaton .",
    "in addition , we assume that only the decay products of the inflaton ( not those of curvaton ) are responsible for the baryon asymmetry of the universe ; the possibilities include a baryogenesis in the thermal bath before the decay of the curvaton and that in association with the decay of the inflaton .",
    "we also assume that the density of cdm is determined after the decay of the curvaton so that there is no cdm isocurvature fluctuations .",
    "we can easily apply our results to the case where cdm originates only from the decay products of the inflaton .    in our study",
    ", we adopt the following form for the scalar - field potential : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent the inflaton and curvaton fields , respectively , @xmath13 is the potential for the inflaton , and @xmath14 is the mass of the curvaton .",
    "( we assume a quadratic potential for the curvaton . ) in general , the curvature fluctuations from the inflaton depend on the inflaton potential . however ,",
    "for the purpose of the following discussion , we only need to specify the value of the slow - roll parameter @xmath15 , which is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the reduced planck scale.in the following , we assume that the primordial fluctuations are ( almost ) scale - invariant .",
    "we also assume that the mass of the curvaton is small and the curvaton acquires primordial fluctuation during the inflation .",

    "we denote the decay rate of the inflaton as @xmath21 and define the reheating temperature @xmath22 as @xmath23 where we use @xmath24 as the effective number of the massless degrees of freedom .",
    "as the universe expands , the expansion rate of the universe @xmath25 becomes comparable to @xmath14 and the curvaton starts to oscillate .",
    "then , when the expansion rate becomes comparable to the decay rate of @xmath12 , which is denoted as @xmath26 ( and is related to the lifetime of the curvaton as @xmath27 ) , the curvaton decays .",
    "the start of the oscillation and the decay may occur before or after the reheating due to the inflaton decay , depending on the values of @xmath14 and @xmath26 .    assuming that the potential of the inflaton is well approximated by a quadratic one around its minimum",
    ", its energy density behaves as that of matter for the period of the inflaton oscillation .",
    "then , denoting the energy densities of radiation components from the decays of @xmath11 and @xmath12 as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , evolutions of these variables ( as well as those of the energy density of the inflaton field and the curvaton amplitude ) are governed by @xmath30 where the dot represents derivative with respect to the cosmic time and @xmath31 indicates the background energy density of the component @xmath32 .",

    "in addition , it should be noted that the total radiation energy density is given by @xmath36    in our analysis , we use the @xmath37 formalism @xcite to calculate the perturbations .",
    "then , perturbation variables are obtained by evaluating the number of @xmath38-folds from some time during inflation to the time after the curvaton decay as a function of model parameters such as @xmath39 and @xmath19 . here",
    ", let us briefly summarize the resultant formulae of the density fluctuations and non - linearity parameter @xmath0 .    with the @xmath37 formalism ,",
