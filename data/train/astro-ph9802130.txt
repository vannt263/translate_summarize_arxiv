    "the radiative cooling time of the gas in the central parts of rich clusters of galaxies can be considerably shorter than the hubble time @xcite and the gas may cool down below x  ray temperatures , forming a cooling flow ( see fabian , 1994 for review ) .",

    "1983 , fabricant & gorenstein 1983 , jones & forman 1984 , stewart et al .",
    "1984 ) , are usually considered as indicators of a cooling flow .",
    "evidence for cool gas was also found in the spectroscopic observations , which revealed the presence of emission lines , characteristic of gas with the @xmath4 k gas ( e.g. canizares et al . , 1979 ) .",
    "detailed studies of the surface brightness distribution in the cooling flows lead to the conclusion , that a fraction of the gas drops out from the flow at different radii , such that the mass deposition rate is proportional to the radius : @xmath5 ( e.g. thomas , fabian and nulsen , 1987 ) .",
    "the fate of the gas which has dropped out from the flow is not well understood .",
    "only small fraction of the cooling gas can form stars with a normal imf .",
    "the optical and uv observations of the central galaxy restrict the total rate of massive star formation rate typically by @xmath0 530 @xmath6 ( e.g. fabian et al .",
    "1984 , mcnamara & oconnel 1993 , cardiel , gorgas , aragon - salamanca 1995 , smith et al . 1997 ) .",
    "detection of excess absorption in several cooling flow clusters ( e.g. white et al . ,",
    "1991 ) seems to support the hypothesis that the cooling matter forms clouds of atomic or molecular gas . to provide effective absorption",
    ", cold clouds must have a covering fraction close to unity @xcite .",
    "recent analysis by allen and fabian ( 1997 ) of a sample of nearby cooling flow clusters observed with rosat confirmed presence of excess absorption , although with covering fraction somewhat lower than unity .",
    "the derived masses of x  ray  absorbing material are @xmath7 @xcite and are hardly consistent with the absence of powerful co and hi emission ( e.g. odea et al .",
    "1994 , voit and donahue 1995 ) .",
    "thus , independent determinations of the cold gas mass are important in understanding the fate of the cooling gas .",
    "geometrically small , optically thick clouds may easily escape detection .",
    "therefore observations at the wavelengths at which the clouds are transparent are the best indicators of total mass of cold gas . from this point of view , x  rays with energies above @xmath06 kev could be useful , since clouds only become opaque at these energies when hydrogen column density exceeds few @xmath8@xmath9 .",
    "the thomson depth of the cooling flow regions , calculated for the hot x  ray emitting gas , can be of the order of @xmath10 . assuming a cooling time in the inner region which is few times shorter than the hubble time",
    ", the averaged thomson depth of the gas deposited during the life time of the cluster can be even higher .",
    "we argue below that such an amount of cold gas is sufficient to produce the emission from the 6.4 kev fluorescent iron line with a flux well above the sensitivity limit of future x - ray missions .",
    "possible presence of the 6.4 kev line in clusters was also noted earlier by vainshtein & sunyaev ( 1980 ) and white et al .",
    "another effect , associated with cold gas , which also might be observed for such values of thomson optical depth is the compton shoulder of the brightest x  ray emission lines .",
    "note that ( unlike co and 21 cm lines or low energy absorption ) the fluxes in the 6.4 kev line and compton shoulder do not depend strongly on the shape or column density @xmath11 of the individual cold clouds as long as @xmath11 is lower than @xmath12 .",
    "let us consider the simplest case of a uniform sphere of neutral ( or molecular ) gas with an x  ray continuum source at the center .",
    "we assume that the optical depth of the sphere is less than 1 for x  rays above @xmath0 6 kev .",
    "absorption of the x ",
    "ray photons above the iron k  shell absorption edge ( @xmath13 kev ) will cause ( with probability @xmath14 , e.g. bambinek et al . , 1972 ) emission of 6.4 kev photons .",
    "thus , the equivalent width of the 6.4 kev line for the whole region can be calculated as ( e.g. vainshtein & sunyaev , 1980 ) : @xmath15 where @xmath11 is the hydrogen column density of the region , @xmath16 is the iron abundance relative to hydrogen ( we adopt @xmath17 , anders and grevesse , 1989 ) , @xmath18 is the photoabsorption cross section ( from the k shell ) of an iron atom , @xmath19 is the incident x - ray spectrum ( in @xmath20 ) .",
    "one can rewrite equation ( [ ew1 ] ) in a more convenient form : @xmath21 for hard power law spectra , the equivalent width of the 6.4 kev line can be of the order of @xmath2  kev . in the cooling flow region , x ",
    "ray emission of the gas is relatively soft and equivalent width may be lower ( see however next section ) .",
    "we calculated the expected equivalent width assuming , for @xmath19 , an emission spectrum of an optically thin plasma at different temperatures ( table 1 ) .",
    "table  1 shows that although `` hotter '' spectra have a clear advantage in terms of producing a larger equivalent width of the iron line , this temperature dependence is not too steep and a change of temperature from 10 to 1 kev results in a decrease by only a factor of @xmath22 in the equivalent width .",
    "cc + temperature & ew ( kev ) + ( kev ) & @xmath23 +   + 1 & 0.24 + 2 & 0.54 + 3 & 0.71 + 4 & 0.83 + 10 & 1.09 +",
    "to estimate the expected equivalent width one should multiply the value , given in table 1 , by the thomson depth of the region and the iron abundance relative to the solar value .",
    "assuming that all gas , deposited in a cooling flow during a hubble time @xmath24  years , forms clouds of neutral gas , one can write : @xmath25 the above estimate assumes that the cold gas is uniformly distributed over the volume and the source of continuum radiation lies at the center . multiplying eq.([tau1 ] ) by the factor from table 1",
    "( e.g. for @xmath26 kev see also discussion below ) one can write for a final estimate of the equivalent width : @xmath27 note that although the hot gas in clusters has ( on average ) an iron abundance less than solar ( @xmath0 0.30.5 ) , a central concentrations of heavy elements was observed in a number of clusters with cooling flows ( e.g. fukazawa et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "note also that the above estimate is insensitive to the shape of the clouds . as long as each individual cloud has an optical depth ( for thomson scattering and for photoabsorption above 6 kev ) much less than 1 , a clumpy distribution ( with an arbitrary covering fraction ) will result in the same equivalent width as a uniform distribution .",
    "the radial distribution of the scattering media is more important .",
    "let us consider the case of an isothermal cluster , i.e. whose emission spectrum at any place in the cluster is characterized by the same value of temperature @xmath28 .",
    "assuming that the mass deposition rate is proportional to the radius ( e.g. thomas , fabian and nulsen , 1987 ) , one can see that the most favorable conditions for producing 6.4 kev fluorescent iron emission is in the very center of the cooling flow .",
    "since the surface brightness of cooling flow clusters is very strongly peaked , then the emission from this region may dominate the spectrum even if the spatial resolution of the instrument does not allow one to fully spatially resolve the cooling flow region .",
    "the equivalent width of the 6.4 kev line reflects the total mass of iron in the region and is insensitive to the shape or size of the clumps , as long as each individual clump is optically thin for x  rays above 6 kev . on the other hand ,",
    "the same clouds can be optically thick to low energy x  rays and the efficiency of low energy absorption can be low ( recalculated per hydrogen atom ) .",
    "thus , if clumps are dense and have a small covering fraction , they may not contribute significantly to the low energy absorption , but still effectively produce 6.4 kev photons . note also , that the resulting equivalent width is almost insensitive to the temperature of the clumps , as long as the temperature is low enough .",
    "allen et al . ( 1996 ) identified three distant clusters : zwicky 3146 ( @xmath29 ) , abell 1835 ( @xmath30 ) and e1455 + 223 as having the largest known mass deposition rates of  1400 , 2300 and 1500 @xmath31 .",
    "the equivalent width of the line from these clusters can be of the order of tens of ev .",
    "for nearby clusters , a478 ( @xmath32 ) , has a large mass deposition rate of order 1000 @xmath31 at @xmath33 kpc ( allen et al . , 1993 ) and",
    "the equivalent width within the 100 kpc central region may be of the order of 10 ev .",
    "one can make a `` more accurate '' estimate of the equivalent width for this cluster ( fig.[a478 ] ) , using the results of the deprojection analysis by allen et al . , 1993 and white et al .",
    ", 1994 . shown in the bottom panel of fig.[a478 ]",
    "is the expected equivalent width of the 6.4 kev line , calculated as a function of the projected radius from the cluster center . in these calculations we assumed that the gas in the cluster is isothermal with a temperature of @xmath34 kev ( allen et al . , 1993 )",
    "of course , given the lack of knowledge of what is the real fate and distribution of the cooling gas , these calculations may not provide more accurate estimates of the line flux than the simple estimates in the previous section for the region as a whole ( assuming a uniform distribution of the cold gas ) .",
    "the total flux in the fluorescent line is defined by the quantity @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 is the density of cold gas and @xmath37 is the radiation density ) integrated over the volume occupied by the cold gas .",
    "note that only that part of the radiation density spectrum above 6 kev determines the flux and equivalent width of the line .",
    "although the emission measure weighted temperature is low in the cooling flow region , compared to the outer hot regions , it is likely that cooling flows are inhomogeneous and hot gas is present even at small radii ( e.g. fabian and nulsen , 1977 , nulsen 1986 , see fabian , 1994 for review ) and above 6 kev the contribution to the radiation density from this hot phase may be dominant ( see e.g. allen , fabian & kneib 1996 ) .",
    "one can estimate the `` effective '' temperature , i.e. the value of @xmath28 which should be used for calculating the line flux ( see table 1 ) , using the high energy ( above 6 kev ) part of the observed spectrum towards the center of the cluster , since the shape of the radiation density spectrum at the cluster center and the observed spectrum along this line of sight coincide for a symmetric cluster .",
    "note also , that if an agn ( having hard x  ray spectrum ) is present in the nucleus of the central galaxy , then the equivalent width of the fluorescent line will be appropriately higher .",
    "assuming that the trend @xmath38 holds down to small radii and cold clouds remain in the region , where they were deposited , then equivalent width will be highest in the very central region of the cooling flow . as noted above",
    "if the radiation density ( above 6 kev ) is strongly peaked at the center of the cooling flow then the emission measure weighted equivalent width from the whole region ( within given radius ) can correspondingly be higher than the equivalent width calculated for given projection radius .    with present instruments ( e.g. asca )",
    "the detection of the 6.4 kev line from the cooling flow regions is questionable .",
    "the expected flux in the 6.4 kev line is relatively weak compared to that of the 6.7 kev line complex and the combination of energy ( and angular ) resolution and sensitivity may not be sufficient to detect @xmath39 10 ev features from clusters",
    ". the better energy resolution of astro - e ( with bolometers ) , spectrum ",
    "x  gamma with the bragg spectrometer  oxs ( see e.g. christensen et al .",
    "1990 ) and especially constellation / htxs @xcite will allow one to detect this line from the clusters with massive cooling flows ( if most of the cooling gas indeed forms molecular clouds ) . for perseus ( assuming an equivalent width of @xmath0 10 ev ) about 100 line photons could be detected in a 100 ksec observation with the bragg spectrometer of spectrum  x  gamma",
    ". shown in fig.[ocs ] is the expected number of photons which will be detected from the central @xmath40 region of the perseus cluster .",
    "an effective area of @xmath0100 @xmath41 ( taking into account the peak reflectivity of @xmath021% ) and an energy resolution of @xmath05 ev were assumed .",
    "the intrinsic structure of the 6.4 kev line ( which consists of two components separated by @xmath013 ev ) was used to generate the figure .",
    "a few 100 ksec exposures ( to measure line and continuum fluxes ) should be sufficient to detect the 6.4 kev line with an equivalent width of a few ev .",
    "for the axaf high energy transmission grating extended nature of the source will significantly complicate the detection of the spectral features . constellation with anticipated effective area of @xmath42 and an energy resolution of few ev will be able to detect very weak lines during short exposure thus allowing studies of clusters with much weaker cooling flows . with constellation it should be even possible to detect 6.4 kev line associated with column densities of the cold gas @xmath43 derived from low energy absorption studies @xcite .",
    "the part of the spectrum around the 6.4 kev line should be relatively free from contamination by bright emission lines from the hot gas . at temperatures lower than @xmath0 1 kev , excitation of the inner shells of fexvii ",
    "fexx ions by electron impact may produce lines at 6.426.47 kev , but their equivalent widths should not be high , if the higher temperature components ( above @xmath44 1 kev ) dominate the spectrum at energies of @xmath0 6 kev .",
    "along with the 6.4 kev ( @xmath45 ) line the @xmath46 line at 7.06 kev should be present with intensity about 10 times lower ( @xmath47 ) than that of the @xmath45 line",
    ". the absorption edge at an energy of 7.1 kev should also be present .",
    "however it may be considerably more difficult to detect relatively wide absorption feature compared to emission line .",
    "another effect , which also scales linearly with the thomson depth of the cold gas is the compton shoulder , associated with the brightest emission lines . assuming a thomson depth for",
    "the cold gas of @xmath48 one can conclude that @xmath0 10% of all photons ( in particular , those in emission lines ) will be scattered , forming the so - called compton shoulder at the left ( low energy ) side of the emission lines ( fig .",
    "[ compt ] ) .",
    "hot gas does not contribute to the formation of the compton shoulder , since large thermal velocity of the electrons causes complete smearing of the features .",
    "on the other hand scattering of the emission lines by electrons bound in atoms and molecules will produce the compton shoulder with distortions , specific to the given type of atom or molecule @xcite .",
    "this effect is also weakly dependent on the cloud parameters and in principle provides the unique possibility of distinguishing between the contributions of free ( @xmath0 cold ) electrons , atomic hydrogen , atomic helium or singly ionized helium , although presence of blends of emission lines ( like the 6.7 kev complex ) may significantly complicates the measurements . in principle ,",
    "combined measurements of the iron @xmath45 line and the compton shoulder allow one to determine the iron abundance ( @xmath49 ) in the cooling flow .",
    "future x  ray missions , combining high energy resolution and large effective area , will be able to estimate the amount of cold gas deposited in massive cooling flows , by measuring the equivalent width of the 6.4 kev iron fluorescent line or the intensity of the compton shoulder , associated with brightest x  ray emission lines . assuming that the bulk of the cooling gas forms cold molecular clouds , the expected fluxes are high enough to ensure their detection .",
    "these measurements could provide robust estimate of the gas mass , insensitive to the detailed shape , density or temperature of the cold clouds , as long as column densities of individual clouds are less than @xmath50 .",
    "in particular , the intensity of the 6.4 kev line will be less dependent on the covering fraction of the clouds than either the magnitude of the low energy absorption or the intensity of the 21 cm or co lines , both of which are more sensitive to the column densities of individual clouds .",
