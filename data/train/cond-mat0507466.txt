    "-0.3 cm topological quantities are fundamental to describe low dimensional quantum liquids where standard symmetry breaking do not have a primal importance @xcite .",
    "typical examples are quantum hall liquids @xcite and anisotropic superconductors with time - reversal symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "recently spin hall conductance for semiconductors are also attracting much current interest @xcite .",
    "the ( spin ) hall conductance has a characteristic geometrical meaning @xcite . in some physical units , they are given by the first chern number of the berry connection @xcite .    in practical numerical calculations , we diagonalize hamiltonians on a set of discrete points on the brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "it is thus crucial to develop an efficient method of revealing the topological property of infinite systems with continuum bz from corresponding finite systems with discrete bz .",
    "we propose an efficient method for the calculation of the chern numbers on a discretized bz based on a geometrical formulation of topological charges in lattice gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the chern numbers thus obtained are _ manifestly gauge - invariant _ and _ integer - valued _ even for a discretized bz .",
    "one can compute the chern numbers using wave functions in _ any gauge _ or _ without specifying gauge fixing - conditions_. details of the formulation and the basic results were published elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "-0.3 cm : let us consider chern numbers in the quantum hall effect as a typical example .",
    "the spin hall conductances is treated similarly .",
    "we take the bz by @xmath0 ( @xmath1 , 2 with integers  @xmath2 ) .",
    "since the hamiltonian  @xmath3 is periodic in both @xmath4 and @xmath5 directions , the bz is regarded as a two - dimensional torus  @xmath6 .",
    "when the fermi energy lies in a gap , the hall conductance is given by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the chern number of the @xmath9th bloch band , and the sum over @xmath9 is restricted to the bands below the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "the chern number assigned to the @xmath9th band is defined by @xmath10 with @xmath11 , where the berry connection @xmath12 with @xmath13 is defined by a normalized wave function of the @xmath9th bloch band @xmath14 satisfying @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the chern number can be nonzero only when the gauge potential can not be defined as a global function over  @xmath6 . in this case , one covers @xmath6 by several coordinate patches and then , within each patch , one can take a local gauge ( a phase convention for the wave functions ) such that the gauge potential is a well defined function . in an overlap between two patches , gauge potentials defined on each patch are related by a @xmath17 gauge transformation : @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath20 . in the continuum theory , one needs to fix this gauge freedom to perform any explicit calculations . to fix the gauge ,",
    "one first selects an arbitrary state @xmath21 which is globally well defined over the whole bz @xcite .",
    "then the gauge can be specified by @xmath22 ( if @xmath23 ) , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are gauge independent .",
    "generically , this gauge is only allowed locally because the overlap @xmath26 may vanishes .",
    "it inevitably occurs to have a non vanishing chern number .",
    "then one needs to use several different state @xmath27 ( gauges ) in several regions of patches to cover the whole bz .",
    ": we now switch to the finite systems with discrete bz . a naive replacement of the differential operator to the difference operator breaks the gauge invariance and topological characters of the chern numbers .",
    "here we propose an explicitly gauge invariant and topological definition of the chern number on a lattice .",
    "let us denote lattice points  @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ,  , @xmath30 ) on the discrete bz as @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "we assume that the state @xmath34 is periodic on the lattice , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a vector in the direction  @xmath37 with the magnitude  @xmath38 .",
    "we first define a @xmath17 link variable from the wave functions @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "it is well defined as long as @xmath41 .",
    "( it is always assumed by an infinitesimal shift of the lattice . )",
    "next we define a lattice field strength by @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the field strength is defined within the principal branch of the logarithm .",
    "finally , we define the chern number on the lattice as @xmath44 we stress here that @xmath45 is manifestly _ gauge - invariant _ and _ strictly an integer _ for arbitrary lattice spacings . to demonstrate it ,",
    "let us introduce a gauge potential @xmath46 ( @xmath47 which is periodic on the lattice : @xmath48 . by definition",
    ", one finds @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the forward difference operator on the lattice , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is an _ integer - valued _ field , which is chosen such that @xmath53 takes a value within the principal branch .",
    "now we have @xmath54 it shows that the lattice chern number  @xmath45 is an integer . to avoid ambiguities we assume that there are no exceptional configurations in the system under consideration , @xmath55 for all @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "this condition will be referred to as _",
    "admissibility_. under this condition , the chern number is uniquely determined .",
    "since our lattice formulation recovers the continuum one in the limit  @xmath56 , we expect the lattice field strength  @xmath57 will be small enough for a sufficiently large  @xmath58 and the lattice chern number will approach the one in the continuum @xmath59 in the this limit . since both @xmath45 and  @xmath8",
    "are integers , we have @xmath60 for meshes of appropriate sizes .",
    "as far as the system is regular , our lattice formulation could reproduce correct chern numbers of the continuum theory even for a coarsely discretized bz , @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "also our method can be extended @xcite to the case of the non - abelian berry connection @xmath62 , which is a matrix - valued one - form associated with a multi - dimensional multiplet @xmath63 @xcite .",
    ": it turns out that the description presented so far proves to be _",
    "unique _ for discretized bz .",
    "namely , under the admissibility , the space of @xmath17 link variables is divided into disconnected sectors and the topological number  @xmath45 is uniquely assigned to each sector . the chern number  @xmath45 is , moreover , a _",
    "unique _ gauge - invariant topological integer which can be assigned to admissible @xmath17  link variables .",
    "the proof of this statement has been given by lscher @xcite .",
    "a key ingredient of his proof is that any u(1 ) link variable can be decomposed uniquely into @xmath64}(k_\\ell)+ia_\\mu^{\\rm t}(k_\\ell ) } \\lambda(k_\\ell)u^{[w]}_\\mu(k_\\ell)\\lambda(k_\\ell+\\hat\\mu)$ ] , where @xmath65}(k_\\ell)$ ] is a gauge field giving rise to the chern number ; @xmath66}(k_\\ell)-\\delta_2a_1^{[\\tilde c_n]}(k_\\ell ) = 2\\pi i\\tilde c_n/(n_1n_2)$ ] , @xmath67 is a periodic transverse field , @xmath68 is a gauge transformation , and @xmath69}_\\mu(k_\\ell)$ ] is a gauge field giving nontrivial wilson lines but giving zero field strength .",
    "once @xmath65}(k_\\ell)$ ] is found , @xmath67 can be determined uniquely by the relation @xmath70 .",
    "readers who are interested in the proof should refer lscher s paper .",
    "the admissibility condition is important for the present lattice formulation and its breakdown is closely related to a singular behavior of the berry connection , that is , it is supplemented with a quantum phase transition . in the present context of the berry connection",
    ", a distribution of the gauge invariant field @xmath57 is completely governed by the @xmath71  dependence of the hamiltonian .",
    "each of the topological ordered states with a nontrivial chern number corresponds to nontrivial topological sector specified by the admissibility and also characterized by the lattice chern number  @xmath45 . in the continuum ,",
    "on the other hand , the topological stability of the chern number is assured by the gap - opening condition @xcite .",
    "the topological quantum phase transitions are thus characterized by the gap closing .",
    "namely , nontrivial topological sectors of the continuum , each of which is a topological ordered state , are separated by the gaps .    in passing , we would like to mention the kubo formula which is often used in numerical calculations : @xmath72 ^ 2}$ ] .",
    "this formula is equivalent the field strength @xmath73 in the continuum bz , but _ not _ to @xmath74 in the discretized bz . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath75 is no longer topological , although the gauge - invariance remains .",
    "therefore , our topological and gauge - invariant formulation for discrete bz should have strong advantages , especially of describing regions where topological transitions occur .",
    "-0.3 cm to demonstrate the present scheme , we take the hamiltonian for spinless fermions in an external magnetic field : @xmath76 , where the flux per plaquette on the coordinate lattice  @xmath77 is  @xmath78 .",
    "we consider a model with quantum phase transition , that is , with next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) hopping @xmath79 ( nearest neighbor hopping is @xmath80 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian in the @xmath71-space is given by @xmath81 , where @xmath82 ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 ,  , @xmath85 ) with @xmath86 and @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "bellow , we will present some results of applying our method to the middle subband of the @xmath88 ( that is , @xmath89 ) system . for simplicity , we set @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "-0.2 cm we show the integer field  @xmath52 in figs .",
    "[ f : nfie](a)-(d ) , where we use the global gauge specified by the states @xmath97 .",
    "the black and white circles denote @xmath96 and  @xmath98 , respectively , whereas a blank implies  @xmath99 .",
    "it is clear that any of them gives the correct chern number  @xmath100 . the field  @xmath52 is gauge - dependent , but their sum is gauge - invariant .",
    "it also shows a convergence of the gauge dependent field @xmath101 in the limit @xmath102 .",
    "although we have fixed the gauge to calculate the field @xmath101 , calculations of the chern numbers are performed in _",
    "any gauge_. we do _ not _ need specific gauge - fixing to make the gauge connection smooth . an _",
    "arbitrary _ gauge ( e.g. , a phase choice of eigenvectors given by a numerical library ) can be also adopted to compute the chern number .",
    "now let us change a ratio @xmath103 in the nnn model .",
    "[ f : nspec ] , we show the energy spectra of the nnn models .",
    "they are modified hofstadter s butterfly diagrams .",
    "the integers in the figures are the hall conductances when the fermi energy lies in the gap , that is , it is a sum of the chern numbers below the energy gap . due to the sum rule of the chern number @xcite , the chern number of the specific energy band is given by a difference of two integers , above and below the band .",
    "as is known  @xcite , the nnn model shows a topological quantum phase transition accompanying a discrete change of the chern numbers .",
    "for example , an increase of @xmath103 causes a rearrangement of the gap connectivity near @xmath104 at @xmath88 .",
    "one can see that the energy gap just above the second band at @xmath88 is rearranged by the small change of @xmath103 .",
    "it is associated with a change of the gap labeling from @xmath105 to + 2 . since the large energy gap just below the middle band is stable and the gap is labeled as + 1 , the chern number of the middle band changes from @xmath106 to + 1 .",
    "this topological change of the chern number is confirmed by a calculation of the gauge dependent field @xmath101 in figs.[f : nf1](b ) and ( d ) .",
    "the field strength @xmath57 just before and the after the quantum transition in also shown in ( a ) and ( c ) .",
    "a small change of the parameter @xmath103 does not change the spectrum so much . on the other hand ,",
    "the field strength @xmath57 is singular at the critical point .",
    "it is consistent with the breakdown of the admissibility as expected .",
    "that is , the quantum phase transition ( of the present lattice model ) occurs at @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "this quantum phase transition is associated with a topological change of the integer value field @xmath101 as shown .",
