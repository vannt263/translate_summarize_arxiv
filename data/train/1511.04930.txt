    "machine - type communications ( mtc ) are typically characterized by a massive number of machine - type devices that connect to the network to transmit small data payloads . those features",
    "present a significant challenge to cellular networks , whose radio access part is traditionally designed to deal with a rather low number of connections with high data requirements .",
    "specifically , current cellular networks , such as lte - a , are connection - oriented  @xcite , requiring a connection establishment between the device and the base station ( bs ) before the device can transmit its data packet . as an example",
    ", the connection establishment in lte - a involves a high amount of signaling overhead , which is particularly emphasized when the data payload is small , e.g. , less than 1000 bytes  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in 3gpp it was proposed an approach to optimize the connection establishment by reducing the signaling overhead  @xcite .",
    "the resulting simplified connection establishment protocol starts with the contention - based access reservation protocol ( arp )  @xcite , depicted in the first four steps in fig .",
    "[ fig : arpcomparison](a ) , followed by a fifth message where the signaling and a small data payload are concatenated .",
    "the signaling exchanges related to the security mechanisms are omitted in the optimized version of the lte - a connection establishment , by reusing an a - priori established security context  @xcite .",
    "the throughput and blocking probability of the arp are rather sensitive to the number of contending devices .",
    "specifically , the devices contend for access by sending their preambles in a designated and periodically occurring uplink sub - frame , here termed as random access opportunity ( rao ) .",
    "when the number of contending devices is high  @xcite , multiple devices activate the same preamble in a rao , which leads to collisions of their rrc connection requests , see fig .",
    "[ fig : arpcomparison](a ) .",
    "consequently , most devices are unable to establish a connection in the first attempt and perform subsequent attempts that , due to the high load , are also likely to result in collisions .",
    "a solution put forward to cope with congestion , was the extended access class barring ( eab ) @xcite , where certain classes of devices are temporally blocked from participating in the arp , but at the cost of an increased access latency to those same devices .",
    "another drawback of the arp is that the network learns the devices identities and connection establishment causes only after the rrc connection request is successfully received , as the contention is performed via randomly chosen preambles that do not carry information .",
    "a solution that allows the network to learn the identities and connection establishment causes of the contending devices already at the beginning of the arp , could enable their differentiated treatment in later phases of the connection establishment and even skip some of the steps in the lte - a random access protocol , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : arpcomparison ] .",
    "[ fig : arpcomparison ]    in this paper we propose a new access method based on signatures and bloom filtering  @xcite .",
    "the method is demonstrated in the context of the lte - a arp , however , we note that it can be employed in the next generation arps  @xcite following similar principles . in the proposed method , instead of contending with a single preamble in a rao , the devices contend by transmitting a predefined sequence of preambles in a frame composed of several raos , the transmitted sequence of preambles is denoted as the _ device signature_. the presented ideas are a conceptual extension of the work @xcite , where the devices contend for access by selecting a random signature , generated by combining random preambles over consecutive raos .",
    "in contrast , in the method described here , each device contends with a unique signature generated using the international mobile subscriber identity ( imsi ) of the device and its connection establishment cause , in further text referred to as the device s identification .",
    "specifically , we apply the bloom - filter  @xcite principles for signature generation , where the device s identification is hashed over multiple independent hash functions and the resulting output used to select which preamble in which rao to activate . we introduce an analytical framework through which we tune the signature properties ,",
    "i.e. , its length and the number of activated preambles , based on the number of expected arrivals and the target efficiency of the use of system resources , denoted as the goodput .",
    "we also investigate the expected latency and signature detection probability of the proposed method .",
    "finally , we show that , when the arrivals are synchronous , the proposed method outperforms the lte - a connection establishment procedure in terms of goodput , while achieving similar or lower average latency .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "a successful lte - a access reservation entails the exchange of four messages , as depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : arpcomparison](a ) .",
    "initially , a device randomly chooses a preamble to be transmitted in a rao from a set of available preambles generated using zadoff - chu sequences  @xcite .",
    "the preambles are orthogonal and can be simultaneously detected by the bs .",
    "we also note that the bs is able to detect a preamble even when it is transmitted by multiple devices  @xcite , i.e. , a collision in the `` preamble space '' is still interpreted as an activated preamble .",
    "this represents a logical or operation , since the preamble is detected as activated if there is _ at least _",
    "one device that transmits the preamble .",
    "this observation motivates the use of bloom filter , a data structure based on or operation for testing set membership .",
    "the devices whose preambles are detected are notified via a random access response ( rar ) in the downlink and assigned a temporary network identifier .",
    "the reception of the rar triggers the transmission of the rrc connection request in the allocated uplink sub - frame . at this point ,",
    "the bs is able to detect the collision of the multiple connection requests , sent by the devices that originally sent the same preamble .",
    "the successfully received connection requests are acknowledged , marking the start of the data transmission phase .",
    "on the other hand , the devices whose connection requests collided , do not receive the feedback and either contend again by sending a new preamble or end up in outage when the number of connection attempts reaches the predefined limit . in the rrc connection request ,",
    "the device informs the network of its temporary identifier , imsi , and the connection establishment cause . from these",
    ", the network can confirm if the device is authorized for access , track the device s subscribed services and reestablish the preexisting security context  @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , the channel over which the devices contend can be modeled as an or multiple access channel ( or - mac ) . by @xmath0 , denote the set of available preambles , where the absence of preamble activation is denoted by the idle preamble @xmath1 .",
    "assume that there are @xmath2 devices in total .",
    "we model the contention by assuming that the device @xmath3 , @xmath4 , transmits a binary word @xmath5,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where bit @xmath6 indicates if the device @xmath3 transmitted preamble @xmath7 .",
    "note that only a single entry @xmath8 , @xmath9 , can be set to 1 since a device can only transmit a single preamble in a single rao .",
    "the bs observes @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes a bit - wise or operator and @xmath12 is the detected binary word of device @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , the bs detects a transmitted preamble with probability @xmath13 and with probability @xmath14 falsely detects a non - transmitted preamble , which may cause that @xmath15 . in practice",
    ", the preamble detection at the bs should ensure that @xmath16 and @xmath17  @xcite requirement in  @xcite corresponds to the single activation of a preamble .",
    "when a preamble is activated by multiple devices it is expected that the effective @xmath18 will be higher  @xcite . ] .",
    "finally , every non - zero entry in @xmath19 implies a detection of the corresponding preamble .",
    "obviously , in the best - case scenario , the bs can detect up to @xmath20 different devices in a rao .",
    "[ fig : lteormac ]    the essence of the proposed method lies in the idea of devices contending with combinations of @xmath21 preambles transmitted over @xmath22 raos , denoted as signatures .",
    "each preamble of a signature is sent in a separate rao , while @xmath22 raos define a signature frame , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lteormac ] . extending the model introduced in section  [ sec : lte_arp ] ,",
    "the device @xmath3 contends by transmitting its signature @xmath23 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the binary words @xmath24 , @xmath25 , follow the structure introduced in .",
    "obviously , the number of available signatures is @xmath26 , potentially allowing for the detection of exponentially more contenders compared to the case in which the preambles sent in each of the @xmath22 raos are treated independently and where the maximal number of detected contenders is @xmath27 .",
    "similarly to , the bs observes @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the detected version of @xmath30 .",
    "the bs decodes all signatures @xmath31 for which the following holds @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the bit - wise and .    at this point",
    ", we turn to a phenomenon intrinsically related to the proposed contention method  @xcite .",
    "namely , even in the case of perfect preamble detection ( @xmath34 ) and no false detections ( @xmath35 ) , the bs may also decode signatures that have _ not _ been transmitted but for which also holds . in other words , the bs may decode _",
    "false positives_. an example of this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ormacsignaturetransmissiondetectionexample ] .",
    "signatures when @xmath36 and @xmath37 and ( b ) erroneous decoding of a signature which was not present in the original transmission ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) . ]",
    "[ fig : ormacsignaturetransmissiondetectionexample ]    the performance of the random signature construction in terms of probability of decoding false positives was first analyzed in @xcite , where they are referred to as phantom sequences .",
    "on the other hand , there is an extensive work on the construction of or - mac signatures  @xcite based on the following criterion : if up to @xmath38-out - of-@xmath2 signatures are active , then there are no false positives .",
    "however , these constructions are not directly applicable to the lte - a access , as they would ( 1 ) require that a device sends multiple preambles in the same rao , and ( 2 ) imply rather long signature lengths , i.e. , @xmath39 , which implies an increased access latency . inspired by bloom filters  @xcite , we propose a novel signature construction that uses much lower signature lengths , at the expense of introducing false positives in a controlled manner .      in the proposed method , the device signature is constructed in such a way that it provides a representation of the device s identification , which is assumed to be a - priori known to the network . to illustrate how a signature is constructed , we first consider the case where a single preamble is available at each of the @xmath22 raos dedicated to the signature transmission , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "taking the view of the device @xmath3 , we start with the binary array @xmath30 of length @xmath22 , indexed from @xmath41 to @xmath22 , where all the bits are initially set to @xmath42 .",
    "we then activate @xmath21 index positions in this array , i.e. , we set them to @xmath41 ; note that @xmath21 is a predefined constant valid for all devices .",
    "this is done by using @xmath21 independent hash functions , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , whose output is an integer value between 1 and @xmath22 , corresponding to an index position in the array , and where @xmath45 is representation of the device identity .",
    "the resulting binary array becomes the device signature .",
    "this construction follows the same steps as the object insertion operation in a bloom filter  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath46 , the signature construction occurs in two stages .",
    "the first stage corresponds to the selection of the @xmath21 active raos using hash functions @xmath43 , @xmath44 , as described previously . in the second stage , for each of the activated raos , a contending device selects and transmits randomly one of @xmath20 preambles .",
    "this is performed by hashing the device identity using another set of independent hash functions @xmath47 , @xmath44 , i.e. , a separate hash function for each rao , whose output is an integer between @xmath41 and @xmath20 that corresponds to one of the available preambles .",
    "the signature - based access reservation protocol is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : arpcomparison](b ) , which starts by the devices transmitting their signatures . upon the successful decoding of a signature ,",
    "the bs transmits the _ rrc connection setup _ message .",
    "in contrast with the lte - a arp depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : arpcomparison](a ) , the messages 2 and 3 are not required in the signature based access , since the bs is able to determine from the signature the imsi of the device and the connection establishment cause .",
    "the protocol concludes with the transmission of the small data payload together with the completion of the rrc connection message .",
    "the described signature generation raises two important issues : ( i ) out of @xmath21 hash functions @xmath43",
    ", @xmath44 , there is a probability of @xmath48 that at least two of these functions generating the same output , leading to less than @xmath21 distinct raos active in a signature ; ( ii ) there is a non - zero probability that two or more devices share the same signature , given by @xmath49^{-1}\\ ] ] and @xmath2 as the total number of devices .",
    "the above probabilities can be minimized by increasing the signature length @xmath22 , which is the reason why these issues are commonly ignored within the bloom filter related literature , where @xmath22 is of the order of @xmath50 .",
    "although we do not use such large ranges for @xmath22 , we note that for values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 that are used in the performance evaluation in section  [ sec : system_performance_evaluation ] , the second probability can be neglected , as in this case @xmath53 .",

    "we provide in alg .",
    "[ alg : bloomfilterinsertion ] a description of a practical signature construction that uses the modulus operation as basis for the hashing .",
    "this construction ensures that @xmath21 distinct raos are active per signature , by removing the raos selected in previous iterations from the set of available raos .",
    "further , the preambles activated in previously selected raos are removed from the set preambles available for the next iteration .",
    "this operation limits the generation of signatures to @xmath57 active raos ; however , this is within the operating range of interest where @xmath58 and allows us to apply probabilistic tools , as presented in the analysis in section  [ sub : analytical_performance_model ] , to design the signatures length @xmath22 and number of active raos @xmath21 . as it will be shown in section  [ sec : system_performance_evaluation ] , the proposed signature generation algorithm matches well the derived analytical model .",
    "finally , we note that an essential prerequisite for the proposed signature access scheme is that the signature generation algorithm and all the hash functions are known to all devices , including the bs .",
    "this can be accomplished via the existing periodic broadcasts that include the network configuration ; an alternative would be to include this information already in the device s subscriber identity module .",
    "we analyze a single instance of the contention process , assuming a synchronous batch arrival of @xmath59 devices .",

    "the parameters of the proposed scheme are the signature frame size , denoted by @xmath22 , the number of active raos in the signature , denoted by @xmath21 , and the number of preambles per rao that are available for signature construction , denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "the first two parameters are subject to design , and we analyze their dimensioning when on average @xmath38-out - of-@xmath2 signatures are active , such that the false positive rate is below a threshold .",
    "in contrast , @xmath20 is assumed to be fixed , which corresponds to the typical scenario in lte - a systems .",

    "fig : arpcomparison](b ) .",
    "we denote this metric as the goodput @xmath63 .",
    "in essence , the goodput reflects the efficiency of the subsequent small data transmission , as the bs will also attempt to serve the falsely detected signatures .",

    "we show the probability of a device being successfully detected at end of the access protocol . here",
    "the proposed method has a slight performance degradation compared to the 3gpp scheme , but this degradation diminishes higher access loads .",
    "the 3gpp scheme achieves higher detection performance due to only requiring one transmission out of all preamble retransmissions to be successful , making it more robust but at the cost of lower goodput and higher latency . on the other hand",
    ", the random signature construction leads to a very low detection performance , as it requires the successful detection of all the active preambles  @xcite .",
    "following the insights provided by bloom filters , we have introduced the concept of signatures with probabilistic guarantees and applied it to a system model derived from the lte - a access reservation protocol .",
    "the most important feature of the proposed method is in allowing the device to be identified already at the access stage .",
    "moreover , the method is very efficient in terms of use of the system resources and has a favorable performance in terms of decoding latency .    in the paper we assumed that the base station serves the successfully connected devices without preferences .",
    "nevertheless , it is straightforward to modify the proposed solution to scenarios in which the bs serves devices based on the identifications inferred from the decoded signatures , i.e. , imsis and/or connection establishment causes . in such cases ,",
    "the proposed access method enables differentiated treatment by the bs from the very beginning .",
    "finally , we note that in the paper we assessed a simplified scenario of a synchronous bath arrival in order to present the key concepts and the related analysis . tuning the proposed scheme for the other typical models , like the beta arrival model for synchronous arrivals or the poisson arrival model for asynchronous arrivals",
