    "we consider the standard problem of denoising grayscale images that are corrupted with additive white gaussian noise @xcite . in this setup",
    ", we are given the _ corrupted _ ( or _ noisy _ ) image @xmath0 where @xmath1 is some finite rectangular domain of @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the unknown _ clean _ image , @xmath4 are independent and distributed as @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the noise level .",
    "the goal is find a _ denoised _",
    "estimate @xmath7 of the clean image from the corrupted samples .",
    "the denoised image should visually resemble the clean image .",
    "one way to quantify the resemblance is using the mean - squared - error ( mse ) which is defined to be @xmath8 later in the paper , we will use the peak signal - to - noise ratio ( psnr ) which is given by @xmath9 .",
    "the image denoising problem has been extensively studied and a survey of even a fraction of this literature is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we instead refer the interested reader to @xcite - @xcite and the references therein .",
    "our present interest is in the image denoising applications of the edge - preserving bilateral filter @xcite .",
    "the denoised image in this case is set to be @xmath10 where @xmath11 the gaussian kernels in are respectively referred to as the _ spatial _ and _ range _ kernels . in practice",
    ", the domain @xmath12 is restricted to some neighbourhood of the origin .",
    "typically , @xmath12 is a square neighbourhood , @xmath13 \\times [ -w , w]$ ] , where @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed exposition on the working and in particular the edge - preserving property of the filter .    the bilateral filter has received renewed attention in the image processing community in the context of image denoising @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that , while the filter is quite effective in removing modest levels of additive noise , its denoising performance drops at large noise levels @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that a patch - based extension of the filter can be used to bring the denoising performance of the filter at par with state - of - the - art methods .",
    "these , and other advanced patch - based methods @xcite , are however much more computation - intensive than the bilateral filter .      in this work",
    ", we present a couple of ideas for improving the denoising performance of the classical bilateral filter , and give fast algorithms for the same .",
    "the contributions ( and the organization ) of the paper are as follows :    @xmath15 in section [ sec : rbf ] , we demonstrate how the denoising performance of the bilateral filter can be improved at large noise levels ( at almost no additional cost ) by incorporating a simple pre - processing step into the framework .",
    "@xmath15 the modified filter is designed to be robust at large noise levels , and tends to perform poorly below a certain noise threshold . to get the best of the either filters at all noise levels , we propose to optimally combine them in a weighted fashion in section [ sec : owf ] .",
    "the optimality is in terms of a certain surrogate of the mean - squared - error ( mse ) known as stein s unbiased risk estimate ( sure ) @xcite .",
    "this mse - estimate is known to be quite accurate in practice @xcite and , as a result , the combined filter is almost always guaranteed to provide a lower mse than the original filter .",
    "@xmath15 following @xcite , we present an approximation for the proposed filtering in section [ sec : fastsure ] that has a fast implementation . we derive the sure estimator for this approximation , and demonstrate how it can be efficiently computed in the process of approximating the bilateral filter .",
    "the overall cost of computing the estimator and the optimally - weighted filters is about twice the cost of computing a single bilateral filtering using the fast algorithm in @xcite .",
    "we provide both visual and quantitative denoising results on standard test images in section [ sec : experiments ] which demonstrate that the improvement over the original filter is significant both visually and in terms of psnr .",
    "notice that the range filter in operates on the noisy samples . in other words ,",
    "the corrupted image is used not just for the averaging but also to control the blurring via the range filter .",
    "what if the range filter could directly operate on the clean image ?",
    "it can be verified that the denoising image obtained using this `` oracle '' filter is visibly better and has higher psnr , which is not surprising .",
    "of course , we do not have access to the clean image in practice , and thus the oracle bilateral filter can not be realized .",
    "nevertheless , one could consider some form of proxy for the clean image .",
    "our proposal is simply to use the box - filtered version of the noisy image as a proxy .",
    "in particular , we propose the following robust bilateral filter ( rbf ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 the amount of smoothing induced by the box filter is controlled by @xmath18 .",
    "we performed exhaustive simulations in this direction .",
    "the simulation results suggest that @xmath19 ( @xmath20 blur ) is optimal for most settings . a possible way to explain",
    "this is that this small blur is able to suppress the noise without excessively blurring the image features .",
    "the denoising results obtained using the standard and the robust filter a couple of test images are shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "we note that the filters have been independently tuned with respect to @xmath21 and @xmath22 to get the best psnr . these results ( and the results on other test images that are not shown here )",
    "suggest that the robust filter starts to perform better beyond a certain noise level depending on the type of image .",
    "this is not surprising since , at low noise levels , the box filtering introduces more blurring than noise suppression which brings down the overall signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "indeed , the corrupted image is already a good proxy for the clean image when the noise floor is small .",
    "on the other hand , notice that the improvement in psnr is often as large as @xmath23 db at large noise levels .",
    "the results in table [ table1 ] suggest that we could possibly perform better denoising by combining and",
    ". a particularly simple idea would be to take a linear combination of these estimates .",
    "that is , we could set the denoised image to be @xmath24 notice that this includes and as special cases .",
    "this bring us to the question of setting the weights @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this can hypothetically be done by minimizing the mse between and the clean image . however , we do not have access to the clean image .",
    "this is precisely where the classical stein s unbiased risk estimate ( sure ) @xcite is useful .",
    "this is given by @xmath27 sure has the property that its expected value equals that of for the gaussian noise model in @xcite .",
    "this makes it an useful surrogate for the mse , which can be computed without the knowledge of the clean image .",
    "we note that the idea of taking linear ( or affine ) combinations of estimators and tuning the weights to get the optimal sure has been tried in different contexts in the literature ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "note that the added computation required for sure are the computation of the partial derivatives in .",
    "we propose to find the optimal weights in by minimizing sure . in particular , on substituting in , we see that sure is quadratic in @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "thus , by convexity , a necessary and sufficient condition for optimality is that that the gradient of must vanish at the optimal weights . in particular",
    ", it can be verified that the resulting gradient equations can be written as @xmath28 , where @xmath29   \\sum_{\\i \\in i } \\hat{f}_1(\\i)\\hat{f}_2(\\i )   &   \\hspace{2 mm } \\sum_{\\i \\in i } \\hat{f}_2(\\i)^2   \\end{pmatrix},\\ ] ] and @xmath30      \\sum_{\\i \\in i } f(\\i ) \\hat{f}_2(\\i ) - \\sigma^2 \\sum_{\\i \\in i } \\partial_{\\i } \\hat{f}_2(\\i )   \\end{pmatrix},\\ ] ] and @xmath31 are the optimal weights .",
    "to simply notations , we will henceforth use the shorthand @xmath32 in place of the operator @xmath33 appearing in . in summary , by computing @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and solving the @xmath36 linear equation @xmath28 , we get the optimal weights .",
    "the weights are then plugged into to get the final denoised image .",
    ".comparison of the standard bilateral filter ( sbf ) and the robust bilateral filter ( rbf ) at @xmath37 . for a fixed image and noise level",
    ", we tuned @xmath21 and @xmath22 to individually optimize the psnr obtained using both methods . [",

    "our objective is to compare the denoising results obtained using the proposed modification with the standard bilateral filter , both visually and in terms of psnr . in this work",
    ", we assume that @xmath6 is provided ; this has to be estimated in practice from the noisy image . in this regard",
    ", we note that it has been demonstrated in @xcite that the sure is quite robust to standard data - based estimates of @xmath6 .",
    "we remark that one can optimize the sure for the proposed filter with respect to @xmath21 and @xmath22 as done in @xcite ; however , we do not investigate this possibility in this paper .",

    "we have used @xmath19 in for all the experiments . to have a fair comparison for a given image and noise level",
    ", we independently tuned @xmath21 and @xmath22 to optimize the psnrs of the respective filters .",
    "we also tuned the parameters of nlm to get the optimal psnr at each noise level .",
    "as remarked earlier , the robust filter starts to perform better than the standard filter beyond a certain noise level ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "notice that the psnr obtained using the optimally - weighted filters is consistently higher than that of the constituent filters at all noise levels ; the improvement is often as large as @xmath44 db . on the other hand ,",
    "the improvement in psnr over the standard bilateral filter is often as high as @xmath23 db .",
    "this does not come as a surprise since it is well - known that the bilateral filter has a lot of scope of improvement at high - noise levels @xcite .",
    "however , what does come as a surprise is that proposed filter is competitive with the non - local means filter @xcite that uses patches ( groups of neighboring pixels ) instead of single pixels for denoising . for a visual comparison ,",
    "the results of a particular denoising experiment are shown in figure [ images ] .",
    "notice that the denoised image obtained using the proposed filter looks much more sharp than that obtained using the standard filter , and has a significantly higher psnr .",
    "also , notice that the noise in the background is much less in ( d ) compared to ( c ) . in table [ table3 ] , we compare the run times of the direct and the fast implementation of the proposed filter for different parameter settings .",
    "notice that the fast implementation is significantly faster than the direct implementation .",

    "the optimal weights were found by solving a small linear system .",
