    "the higgs mechanism , which is responsible for the generation of all particle masses in the standard model  ( sm ) , is as yet an experimentally untested mechanism .",
    "this mechanism of mass generation leaves behind a remnant in the form of scalar particle(s ) , the higgs boson(s ) , which has eluded the experimental search so far . the higgs particle is expected to be discovered at the lhc , if not at lep2 @xcite .",
    "current estimates from precision electroweak data @xcite suggest that it is rather light .",
    "although a light higgs particle would be consistent with the standard model , it is natural only in a supersymmetric framework  @xcite .",
    "the minimal version of the supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) contains two higgs doublets @xmath3 with opposite hypercharges  @xcite : @xmath4 , @xmath5 , so as to generate masses for up- and down - type quarks ( and leptons ) , and to cancel triangle gauge anomalies .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by the neutral components of @xmath6 and @xmath7 obtaining vacuum expectation values , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , the mssm contains two neutral @xmath11-even ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , one neutral @xmath11-odd ( @xmath14 ) , and two charged ( @xmath15 ) higgs bosons .",
    "because of gauge invariance and supersymmetry , all the higgs masses and the higgs couplings in the mssm can be described ( at tree level ) in terms of only two parameters , which are usually chosen to be @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the mass of the @xmath11-odd higgs boson .",
    "once a light higgs boson is discovered , a detailed measurement of its branching ratios should , in principle , enable one to distinguish between a sm higgs boson and the lightest mssm higgs boson .",
    "apart from the large number of higgs bosons in the minimal version of the supersymmetric standard model , there is more to the mssm higgs sector than the branching ratios . for a complete analysis of the higgs sector , one should also measure the trilinear and quartic self - couplings of the higgs boson , which in the mssm are determined ( at the tree level ) by the gauge couplings .",
    "the measurability of trilinear couplings involving the light higgs boson was investigated by djouadi , haber and zerwas @xcite . in this preliminary study , it was concluded that the trilinear couplings @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the two neutral , @xmath11-even higgs bosons , could be measured at a high - energy @xmath20 linear collider . a more detailed study , including the squark mixing , of the measurability of the trilinear higgs couplings was carried out in @xcite .",

    "all the trilinear self - couplings of the physical higgs particles can be predicted theoretically  ( at the tree level ) in terms of @xmath17 and @xmath16 .",
    "once a light higgs boson is discovered , the measurement of these trilinear couplings can be used to reconstruct the higgs potential of the mssm .",
    "this will go a long way in establishing the higgs mechanism as the basic mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking in gauge theories .",
