    "low - dimensional molecular conductors provide a fruitful stage to study strong electron correlation effects leading to a wide variety of phase transitions  @xcite . in this context ,",
    "among the most - studied families are the quasi - one dimensional ( q1d ) molecular conductors tmttf@xmath1@xmath3 ( tmttf : tetramethyl - tetrathiofulvalene , @xmath3 : monovalent anion )  @xcite .",
    "these salts form a q1d @xmath4-band at quarter - filling in terms of holes with intrinsic dimerization along the conduction axis .",
    "they exhibit various types of phase transitions such as ferroelectric charge ordering ( fco ) , spin - peierls ( sp ) , antiferromagnetic ( af ) , and superconducting ( sc ) transitions by applying pressure or replacement of @xmath3  @xcite . among them , ( tmttf)@xmath1sbf@xmath2 shows a peculiar behavior under pressure ; a cooperative reduction of fco and af phase transition temperatures by the application of pressure has been reported by nmr measurements  @xcite .",
    "this result naively does not coincide with the case for typical co transitions , where co suppresses the tendency toward magnetic ordering due to decrease of the effective spin exchange couplings  @xcite .",
    "recently we have proposed a mechanism where the fco transition increases the two - dimensionality in the magnetic sector and leads to the stabilization of the af state  @xcite . in this study , we have also found that the diagonal inter - chain hopping @xmath0 strongly depends on the choice of anion .",
    "intriguingly , @xmath0 causes geometrical frustration between the chains of spins localized on every dimer , forming q1d exchange couplings as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] ( b ) ; we will see this effect more explicitly later .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the role of @xmath0 for the spin ordering in the absence or the presence of fco , and how it affects the cooperative behavior between fco and two - dimensional ( 2d ) af states in tmttf@xmath1sbf@xmath2 .",
    "we investigate a q1d extended hubbard model at 1/4-filling in terms of holes with coulomb interactions and inter - chain hoppings , whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the transfer integral between the neighboring sites denoted by @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of a hole on the @xmath10th site with spin @xmath11 or @xmath12 , and @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",

    ", we see that @xmath60 and @xmath61 cooperatively develops in @xmath62 ; the fco correlation assists in stabilizing the af state .",
    "the noticeable point is that @xmath0 becomes relevant for the af correlation in the fco state , as seen from the enhancement of @xmath63 by @xmath0 only for @xmath62 , whereas the change is small for @xmath64 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath0 is irrelevant for the fco correlation , i.e. @xmath60 does not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "for insight into the effects of @xmath0 on the magnetic properties , we consider the strong coupling limits and estimate the leading terms of the spin exchange couplings by perturbation calculations with respect to the transfer integrals . in the dimer - mott insulating state for the case of large @xmath15 and small @xmath57 , the spin - exchange couplings between dimers along @xmath65-axis and @xmath66-axis are given by @xmath67 and @xmath68 with the effective on - site coulomb interaction for the dimer units @xmath69  @xcite .",
    "also , in the presence of @xmath0 there is a diagonal inter - chain spin - exchange coupling @xmath70 .",
    "this term causes the spin frustration between inter - chain dimers as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] ( b ) and is enlarged toward @xmath71 ; in fact , the @xmath72 dependence of @xmath73 becomes weak with increasing @xmath45 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] ( c ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the basis of the fco state for the case of large @xmath15 and @xmath57 , the coupling between the nearest - neighbor intra - chain charge rich sites is given by @xmath74 from the forth - order perturbation  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath43 , the coupling between inter - chain charge rich sites is given by @xmath75 from the second - order perturbation .",
    "since @xmath76 is suppressed with increasing @xmath57 , @xmath77 can become the same order compared to @xmath76 .",
    "this gives the increase of the two - dimensionality in the magnetic sector and induces 2d af state  @xcite . in the presence of @xmath0 ,",
    "there is another additional contribution for the coupling between inter - chain charge rich sites @xmath78 from the third - order perturbation process ( for example , @xmath79 and @xmath80 in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] ( a ) ) , which is given by @xmath81 .",
    "here , the minus sign comes from the minus term coupling with the transfer integrals in eq .",
    "( [ ehm ] ) .",
    "since @xmath82 is large compared to @xmath83 , this process can become the same order compared to @xmath77 in the intermediate @xmath57 region . as a result ,",
    "this contribution becomes relevant in the presence of fco and the two - dimensionality in the spin sector increases .",
    "this agrees with the behavior of the @xmath57 dependence of @xmath61 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] ( b ) .",
    "we can conclude that not only the enhancement of the two - dimensionality in spin sector by fco but also the largeness of @xmath0 in sbf@xmath2 salt compared to other salts promotes stabilization of the coexisting af and fco state observed in the experiments  @xcite .    finally , we comment on the role of @xmath0 in the presence of electron - phonon couplings , which is relevant for the sp state in both the dimer - mott and the co states  @xcite .",
    "previous works show that , in general , the sp state is suppressed and the 2d af state is stabilized with increasing the inter - chain spin exchange coupling @xmath77  @xcite . in pf@xmath2 salt , it is experimentally indicated that , at finite - temperatures above the first order boundary between the two states , a quantum critical behavior is seen , controlled by a hidden quantum critical point  @xcite .",
    "the competition between the sp and the 2d af states occurs as well in the presence of fco  @xcite .",
    "the role of @xmath0 may enhance the strong quantum fluctuations and bring about difficulties in determining the magnetic phases in the fco state at low temperatures .",
    "one possibility is that the fluctuation leads to the destabilization of ordered phases in the critical region , and results in a spin - liquid state down to the ground state , in between the sp and the 2d af quantum critical points .",
    "this @xmath0 effect on the magnetic properties with electron - phonon couplings remains as a future problem .    in summary",
    ", we have investigated the effects of charge order and the diagonal inter - chain transfer integral on the spin ordering in tmttf@xmath84 .",
    "the diagonal @xmath0 works as spin frustration between the inter - chain dimers in the dimer - mott insulating state and reduces the af correlation . on the other hand , in the presence of fco ,",
    "this spin frustration is released and 2d af correlation is developed ; @xmath0 enhances the two - dimensionality in the spin sector .",
    "this assistance of @xmath0 for the cooperative behavior between the fco and the af states agrees with the experiments in tmttf@xmath1sbf@xmath2 .",
