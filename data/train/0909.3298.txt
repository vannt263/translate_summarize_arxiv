    "a census of dwarf galaxies in the neighborhoods of large systems such as the milky way and andromeda ( m31 ) can yield important constraints on the processes that shaped massive galaxies .",
    "current predictions from @xmath13cdm simulations suggest that at least an order of magnitude more satellites should be present around these systems than has been observed ( e.g. , klypin et  al .",
    "1999 ; moore et  al .",
    "several explanations for this `` missing satellite problem '' have been suggested , both on the theoretical and observational fronts .",
    "for example , many of the predicted subhalos may be entirely `` dark '' , and therefore may not have experienced any star formation ( e.g. , somerville 2002 ) , and/or our census of these low - luminosity galaxies may be highly incomplete .",
    "recent wide field surveys in both the milky way and m31 have confirmed the latter possibility . in our galaxy ,",
    "the number of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) known has doubled in the past few years , thanks in large part to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss  york et al .",

    "similarly , the last three years has seen the number of dsphs in m31 grow by more than a factor of two @xcite . yet , considering the limited regions of the milky way and m31 that have been surveyed for these lower luminosity galaxies , many more such galaxies should be discovered in the coming years ( e.g. , with pan - starrs , the southern hemisphere stromlo missing satellites survey on the skymapper telescope ",
    "keller et  al .",
    "2007 , and the large synoptic survey telescope , see tollerud et  al .",
    "2008 for expected number counts ) .",
    "none of the newly discovered milky way dsphs in the sdss are directly seen in the initial images , but rather they are detected as resolved stellar overdensities .",
    "deeper follow up images have revealed that some of these galaxies are distinct in their properties as compared to the existing sample ; they are more irregular and have very low surface brightnesses ( @xmath14 27 mag  arcsec@xmath15 ) .",
    "the faintest objects , such as willman  1 and segue  1 , have an integrated luminosity less than a _ single bright red giant _ , and in an @xmath11 vs half - light radius plane , appear to bridge globular clusters and dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "several investigations are now underway to understand the detailed nature of these systems ( e.g. , mean abundance , abundance spread , velocities , and mass - to - light ratios ) through follow up spectroscopic observations ( e.g. , simon & geha 2007 ; koch et  al .",
    "2008a ; norris et  al .",
    "2008 ; geha et  al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "in distinction to the milky way satellites , there have been limited spectroscopic observations of individual stars in m31 dsphs , with most studies only confirming a handful of members @xcite .",
    "similar studies of m31 _ field stars _ in the splash survey have recently revealed that the metal - rich inner spheroid of m31 dominates the metal - poor outer halo out to a much larger radius ( 20  30  kpc ) than in the milky way @xcite .",
    "this disparity likely reflects a more violent accretion history in m31 as compared to our galaxy @xcite , the roots of which may lie in the properties of the accreted ( and possibly unaccreted ) satellite systems of the two galaxies .",
    "in fact , @xcite show that , at a fixed luminosity , the scale radii of the m31 dsph galaxies is a factor of two larger than the canonical milky way satellites .",
    "if the dark matter masses of these galaxies are the same _ and _ the mass traces the light , this difference should be reflected in the velocity dispersions of the galaxies with the m31 sample being colder .",
    "however , alternate assumptions on the spatial distribution of stars relative to the dark matter can lead to different conclusions , as discussed in  [ discussion ] .    to address some of these questions ,",
    "our team has now begun a systematic survey of m31 dsphs with the keck  ii telescope and deimos multi - object spectrograph . at the distance of m31 , the apparent angular size of a typical dsph",
    "is well suited for this instrument as we can easily target several hundred potential red giants simultaneously . to date , six of the m31 dsphs have been targeted , including and  xiv which has been presented in @xcite and and i , ii , and iii which will be presented in @xcite . in this paper , we discuss the _ first _ spectroscopic study of individual red giants in the newly discovered , low - luminosity m31 dsph , and  x @xcite .",
    "our target selection , observational design , and data reduction are presented in the next section , followed by an analysis of the and  x velocity histogram to establish both the membership of individual stars and the mean velocity of the galaxy (  3 ) .",
    "we resolve the intrinsic central velocity dispersion of and  x in  [ velocitydispersion ] and calculate the mass - to - light ratio of the galaxy .",

    "this `` cross '' pattern reflects the @xmath845  degree position angle of the two spectroscopic masks .",
    "this arrangement ensures the targeting of many stars near the center of and  x as well as along spokes that extend to beyond the tidal radius of the galaxy.,width=321 ]",
    "and  x was first discovered as a stellar overdensity on an sdss imaging scan of the major axis of m31 ( extending 18@xmath24 2.5@xmath25 ) , observed on 5 october 2002 @xcite .",
    "the overdensity was only visible after selecting objects with magnitudes and colors consistent with the red giant branch in a metal - poor population , at the distance of m31 .",
    "spatially , the overdensity lies along the projection of the n - e major axis at a distance of @xmath080  kpc from m31 s center .",
    "these initial observations were followed up with subsequent imaging from the william herschel telescope and the nordic optical telescope in late 2004 .",
    "the resulting images confirmed the presence of a low surface brightness , spatially coherent group of stars with a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) indicating a blue red giant branch ( i.e. , presumably metal - poor stars ) .",
    "the integrated @xmath26-band luminosity of the galaxy is @xmath11 = @xmath78.1 @xmath8 0.5 .",
    "further details on these photometric observations are presented in @xcite , although we note here that our default photometric catalogue is taken to be the william herschel telescope data as the calibration is superior to the nordic optical telescope data .",
    "we used these photometric data as input for our multiobject spectroscopic observations with keck  ii .",
    "the image of and  x from the nordic optical telescope shows the galaxy to have an extent of a few arcminutes .",
    "the estimated tidal radius by @xcite is @xmath07  arcminutes , much smaller than the long - axis of the deimos spectrograph , which extends @xmath016  arcminutes ( see figure  [ fig : d10starcountmap ] ) .",
    "therefore , we could easily observe the full extent of the galaxy with a single pointing .",
    "we selected targets based on their location in the cmd .",
    "the tip of the red giant branch in and  x is located at @xmath27 = 20.25 ( @xmath28 = 701  kpc ) , and so our highest priority objects are those with 20.0 @xmath29 22.0 .",
    "lower priorities are given to fainter stars .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table2 ]",
    "and  x has an integrated magnitude ( @xmath11 = @xmath78.1 @xmath8 0.5 ) that bridges the luminosity of the local group dwarf galaxies known prior to sdss ( @xmath715.5 @xmath308.5 ) , and those since discovered ( @xmath78 @xmath303.5 ) . over this factor of nearly 10@xmath31 in luminosity ( more than 12 magnitudes ) , these galaxies show a remarkable trend with more more luminous dwarfs also being more metal - rich ( see , e.g. , figure  11 in simon & geha 2007 ) .",
    "we have shown  using both photometric and spectroscopic diagnostics  that the stellar populations in and  x are metal - poor , with [ fe / h ] = @xmath71.9 to @xmath72.1 , depending on the method adopted and/or assumption of [ @xmath32/fe ] .",
    "the galaxy therefore anchors the low luminosity end of the classical satellites , and has a mean metallicity consistent with the established trend .",
    "when we also include the new sdss galaxies , and  x is well placed within the overall sequence of data points and does not appear to be underluminous relative to its metallicity ( which could have suggested evidence of tidal stripping ) .",
    "our kinematic analysis of and  x shows that the galaxy is moving with a heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath3  km  s@xmath2 , and has a very low intrinsic velocity dispersion , @xmath33  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "compared to similar luminosity milky way dsphs such as carina , draco , ursa minor , and canes venatici i , and  x s intrinsic velocity dispersion is a factor of 1.7  2.4 smaller .",
    "although its size is larger than carina , draco , and ursa minor by a similar factor ( see below ) , the ratio of @xmath34@xmath35 comes out lower .",
    "we use this to estimate the mass of and  x ( assuming mass follows light ) and find @xmath36 = @xmath37 10@xmath38  @xmath39 , implying a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath5 = @xmath6 .",
    "the dark matter mass of and  x is therefore approximately a factor of four lower than milky way dsphs with comparable , but slightly higher , luminosity ( see  [ velocitydispersion ] ) .",
    "it is difficult to draw strong conclusions on the possible implications of the mass difference between and  x and similar milky way satellites .",
    "the differences may simply reflect variations of in situ processes , in which case and  x may be an oddball with respect to the small comparison sample of galaxies at similar luminosities .",
    "alternatively , if and  x is a typical representative of the m31 dsph sample , the observed differences may have been possibly shaped by intrinsic differences in the overall properties of the milky way and m31 halos . for example , the past interaction history of these dsphs with their hosts are likely different in the two systems as m31 appears to have a more violent accretion history @xcite .",
    "whether or not this could lead to preferentially more stripping of the dark matter halos of the surviving satellites such as and  x is not certain , especially within the visible radius of the galaxy ( e.g. , stars should also be stripped then ) .",
    "hints of overall global differences between m31 and the milky way have already been characterized , on several fronts .",
    "for example , m31 contains many more globular clusters than the milky way ( e.g. , barmby & huchra 2001 ) , m31 s stellar density at 20  kpc along the minor axis is 10@xmath40 higher than the milky way @xcite , and m31 s halo contains a vast amount of substructure extending out to very large radii @xcite .",
    "further differences are seen in the overall age , metallicity , and surface brightness distributions , as characterized in our overall splash survey .",
    "for example , m31 s halo contains an appreciable fraction of stars with ages less than 10  gyr out to 20  kpc along the minor axis @xcite , and the radius at which the metal - poor halo dominates the metal - rich inner spheroid is much further out in m31 than in the milky way @xcite .",
    "interestingly , there is another piece of evidence suggesting systematic differences between the dsph populations of the milky way and m31 . as we mentioned in ",
    "[ intro ] , @xcite analyzed photometric data of a half dozen m31 dsphs and found that at a fixed luminosity , these satellites are larger by a factor of two and have fainter central surface brightnesses than milky way satellites . and  x is not included in that sample , however it does appear to follow the same trend .",
    "the half light radius is 330  pc and tidal radius is 1500  pc , both much larger than the corresponding sizes of similar luminosity milky way satellites . yet , as discussed above , the very low intrinsic velocity dispersion of and  x more than compensates for its larger size in yielding a total mass that is _ lower _ than these milky way satellites .    and  x s mass measurement depends critically on our assumptions related to how the dark matter mass links to the stellar distribution ; namely , we have adopted the formalism that the mass traces light .",
    "a different interpretation of the kinematics would result from an overall different spatial segregation .",
    "for example , penarrubia , mcconnachie , & navarro ( 2007 ) compute models in which the kinematics are dictated by the ratio of the king core radius ( stellar ) to the nfw scale radius ( dark matter ) , and find that a more concentrated distribution exhibits a lower velocity dispersion . with this assumption ,",
    "less dark matter mass is needed in the larger galaxies to explain the same observed velocity dispersion .",
    "penarrubia et  al .",
    "go on to predict that , assuming m31 and milky way dsphs have the same overall dark matter mass , the velocity dispersions of the m31 satellites should be larger than the milky way satellites . based on our sample of a single m31 dsph , our results do not agree with this prediction .",
    "there are currently 17 known m31 dsphs , and  i  iii , v ",
    "xvii , and xix  xx , the last ten of which have been discovered in the past three years @xcite .",
    "( the three systems not included , and  iv , viii and xviii , are background or ambiguous objects originally identified as m31 dsphs . ) radial velocities of at least a few individual red giants have been measured in the first six of these galaxies @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , with the exception of stars in and  ii and and  vii , which were targeted with hires on keck , the data were collected at both low resolution and low signal - to - noise , resulting in large velocity uncertainties , and therefore the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the satellites were not resolved .",
    "for the two galaxies observed with keck / hires , the central velocity dispersion was estimated to be @xmath09  km  s@xmath2 in both galaxies , based on seven stars in and  ii @xcite and 18 stars in and  vii @xcite . for the newly discovered sdss satellite and  ix @xcite , @xcite present a keck / deimos study establishing just five member stars within the inner 1.4@xmath21 of the galaxy and possibly another six or seven members at larger radius .",
    "as the authors note , their results are very sensitive to the adopted membership criteria .",
    "the inclusion of just one star in the outer bin inflates the velocity dispersion by a factor of almost two , and therefore we can not reliably use this measurement until further data are obtained .",
    "@xcite also present radial velocities for stars in the newly discovered galaxy and  xiv , which we will analyze in kalirai et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "clearly , all of these m31 dsphs need to be re - targeted to establish accurate kinematics based on larger numbers of stars .",
    "in addition , the newly detected objects that have not yet been looked at need to be observed . our team has now begun a systematic survey to compile this data set , the first results from which will include an analysis of 50  100 accurate radial velocities in each of and  i , ii , and iii .",
    "we will also combine the results from the study of these three galaxies with a more detailed analysis of the results presented in @xcite for and  vii , @xcite for and  xiv , and of course also include the present work on and  x. as discussed earlier , future modeling of these dsphs will also incorporate advanced techniques such as those presented by @xcite for milky way galaxies , allowing mass profiles to be constructed for each satellite . in this way ,",
    "the dark matter masses of dsph members of the milky way and m31 can be compared out to the same physical radii . with a sample of six galaxies",
    ", these comparisons can also be made over a large range in luminosity and galactocentric radius , thereby providing more leverage on understanding the sources of any observed differences .",
    "a _ detailed _ understanding of the dark matter mass profiles of the m31 dsphs will require significantly larger data sets involving accurate radial velocities of several hundred stars in each galaxy .",
    "such data can provide information on how luminosity maps to dark matter subhalo mass and also shed light on the validity of alternative dark matter candidates such as `` warm dark matter '' .",
    "these types of detailed studies are just now underway for several of the milky way dsphs ( e.g. , strigari et  al .  2006 ) and will soon be undertaken in the nearest , most luminous dsphs of m31 . to this effort , we have now obtained the first wave of the data required to make these measurements ; an analysis of @xmath0500 individual radial velocities in the luminous dsph and  ii is underway .",
