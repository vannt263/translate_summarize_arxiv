    "the prototypical @xmath16-dimensional distribution is a gaussian @xcite , wherein the configurational entropy estimates the information demanded in the reciprocal space to constitute the energy density in the position space .",

    "although black holes are at thermal equilibrium with radiation , they are not the preferred state below a certain critical temperature @xcite . subsequently to this investigation , but shortly after the discovery of the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence @xcite , the connection between the thermal properties of an ads - schwarzschild black hole and those of a dual gauge theory were unveiled in ref .",
    "the thermal phase transition found in ref .",
    "@xcite , presently known as hawking - page transition , was interpreted in ref .",
    "@xcite as a transition between a deconfined phase ( corresponding to a high temperature ) and a confined phase ( low temperature ) .",
    "in order to understand the phase transition , one has to compare the actions of the ads metric and the ads - schwarzschild metric .",
    "the phase transition occurs in the regime where the two actions are equal @xcite .",
    "the anti - de sitter space is a solution of the vacuum einstein equation with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "the metric of a ( thermal ) ( @xmath17)-dimensional euclidean ads space , in global coordinates , can be written as : @xmath18 the boundary of the space , at @xmath19 , is the product of a @xmath20-sphere @xmath21 and the circumference @xmath22 , associated with the temporal variable that has a period @xmath23 , where the equivalence @xmath24 defines the time circle @xmath22 .",

    "the fourier transform of the energy density is used to define the modal fraction in eq .",

    "the dominance is related to the difference between the black hole action and the thermal ads action .",
    "the semi - classical argument , underlying the hawking - page transition , consists of the relative probability of a given configuration that is proportional to the exponential of ( minus ) the corresponding action .",

    "there is no particular signature of the hawking - page transition point from the point of view of the configurational entropy .    by taking the logarithm of the configurational entropy as a function of the black hole radius",

    "we know that schwarzschild black holes in flat space evaporate by emitting hawking radiation .",
    "the smaller the black hole , the shorter its life time is .",
