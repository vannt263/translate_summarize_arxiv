    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) predicts at least one light neutral scalar higgs particle with mass below @xmath2 gev . in order to experimentally detect possible signals of higgs bosons and to trace back as far as possible the physical origin of a produced scalar particle ,",
    "detailed studies for the decay and production processes of higgs boson are required .    as has been discovered several years ago  [ 1 - 3 ] , radiative corrections in the mssm higgs sector are large and have to be taken into account for phenomenological studies .",
    "several methods have been developed to calculate the radiative corrections to the mssm higgs boson masses , production and decay rates .",
    "three main approaches have been used for the calculation of 1-loop corrections :    * the effective potential approach ( epa )  @xcite : this method computes the dominant correction to the higgs boson mass spectrum and coupling constants in a simple and fast way and is thus most suitable for numerical calculations , e.g. in monte carlo studies . in its practical realizations ,",
    "it is based on the following approximations : * * only the corrections to the 2-point green s functions are included , and only the contributions from top / stop and bottom / sbottom are taken into account * * the green s functions are evaluated at momentum @xmath3 , thus neglecting the momentum dependence .",
    "+ the epa leads to expressions for the cross sections and decay branching ratios in an effective born approximation , where the tree level quantities are replaced by the corrected higgs boson masses and mixing angles . *",
    "the renormalization group approach ( rge )  @xcite .",
    "this method also leads to an effective born approximation in the formulae for cross sections .",
    "the 1-loop corrected higgs boson masses and couplings are obtained by using rg equations .",
    "large logarithmic terms can be resummed , but realistic mass spectra are not covered by this method since it relies on an effective susy scale .",
    "the momentum dependence of the self - energies and 3- and 4-point functions are neglected also in this approach . *",
    "the diagrammatic calculation ( feynman diagram calculation , fdc )  @xcite : the masses are calculated from the pole positions of the higgs propagators , and the cross sections are obtained from the full set of 1-loop diagrams contributing to the amplitudes . the version of ref .",
    "@xcite is based on the on - shell renormalization scheme .",
    "it takes into account : * * the most general form of the mssm lagrangian with soft breaking terms , * * the virtual contributions from all the particles of the mssm spectrum , * * all 2- , 3- and 4-point green s functions for a given process with higgs particles , * * the momentum dependence of the green s functions , * * the leading reducible diagrams of higher orders corrections . +",
    "this method is technically most complicated , but also most accurate at the 1-loop level and can be used as the reference frame for simpler methods .",
    "moreover , it allows to study the full parameter dependence of cross sections and decay rates .",
    "the experimental searches for higgs bosons at lep1  @xcite and studies for the future searches at higher energies  @xcite conventionally make use of the most compact effective potential approximation .",
    "the phenomenological study in ref .",
    "@xcite for lep2 and higher energies , was done in the fdc , but still not complete at 1-loop order .",
    "a check of the quality of the simpler approximations and estimates of their reliability in various energy and parameter ranges have also not yet been performed so far .    in this paper",
    "we present the first complete 1-loop diagrammatic results for the cross sections for the neutral higgs production processes @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , we compare the results from the complete diagrammatic calculation with the corresponding ones of the simpler and compact effective potential approximation and discuss the typical size of the differences .",
    "recently some papers on the leading 2-loop corrections to the cp - even mssm higgs boson masses have been published  @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion is that 2-loop corrections are also significant and tend to compensate partially the effects of 1-loop corrections .",
    "the calculations are based on the epa and rg methods . since one of the main emphasis of our study is to figure out the difference between complete and approximate results in a given order , we have not implemented the 2-loop terms .",
    "they would improve the 1-loop fdc results in the same way as the approximations and thus do not influence the remaining differences which can only be obtained by an explicit diagrammatic calculation .    in section  [ sec :",
    "outline ] we give a short description of the computational schemes for the masses and cross sections .",
    "this is followed in section  [ sec : results ] by a discussion of the numerical results and a comparison of the various approximations .",
    "the tree level potential for the neutral mssm higgs bosons can be written as : @xmath4 diagonalization of the mass matrices for the cp - even and the cp - odd scalars , following from the potential  ( [ eq : pot0 ] ) , leads to three physical particles : two cp - even higgs bosons @xmath5,and one cp - odd higgs boson , and defines their tree - level masses , and , with @xmath6 , and the mixing angles @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the 1-loop radiative corrections significantly modify the tree level relations between the masses and mixing angles .",
    "the way of calculating the radiative corrections in the epa and fdc methods is briefly described as follows :    in the epa , the tree level potential @xmath9 is improved by adding the 1-loop terms  @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 @xmath12 is the tree level potential evaluated with couplings renormalized at the scale @xmath13 , and @xmath14 denotes the supertrace over the third generation of quark and squark fields contributing to the generalized squared mass matrix @xmath15 .",
    "the full 1-loop potential @xmath16 is rediagonalized yielding the 1-loop corrected physical masses , and the effective mixing angle . thereby and",
    "@xmath17 are usually considered as the free input parameters .",
    "explicit formulae for the 1-loop corrected cp - even higgs mass matrices can be found in first paper of ref .",
    "the physical higgs boson masses and 1-loop mixing angles are used in the born formulae for the production cross sections and decay rates .    in many experimental neutral mssm higgs searches a simplified version of the epa ( )",
    "was used in the analysis of the experimental data . in this approximation",
    "only the leading correction coming from the top and stop quark loops to the higgs mass matrix is included . in addition , the effects of the sfermion mixing are neglected . in this case",
    "the corrected higgs mass matrix has the simple form : @xmath18 where @xmath19 summarizes the leading 1-loop corrections : @xmath20 this yields : @xmath21 @xmath22 the 1-loop corrected higgs boson masses , and the effective mixing angle thus depend on only one extra susy parameter , namely the product @xmath23 of the scalar top mass eigenvalues , in addition to the tree level parameters and @xmath17 .    in the fdc approach the 1-loop physical higgs boson masses are obtained as the pole positions of the dressed scalar propagators . in order to obtain accurate values of the masses , also",
    "the leading reducible terms of higher order have to be taken into account . @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "are given by the solution of the equation of the form : @xmath26=0 \\label{eq : fdcmass}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the calculations of the cross sections we need the full set of scalar 2-point functions , and also the 3- and 4-point green s functions are taken into account . in figure",
    "[ fig : feyn ] the diagrams contributing to the @xmath27 process are collected .",
    "specially important is the diagram f ) in figure  [ fig : feyn ] , illustrating the -mixing on the external scalar line , as this mixing corresponds in a good approximation to the effect of introducing the effective mixing angle into the born formulae .",
    "the formulae for the cross sections obtained in the fdc now differ from the born expressions , because not only the effective values of the masses are corrected but also new form factors and momentum dependent effects are considered .",
    "the analytic formulae for the cross sections for the processes @xmath28 , including all but the box and 1-loop @xmath29 vertex contributions , can be found in the first paper of ref .",
    "effects of box contributions are discussed in the third paper of ref .  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we include also the 1-loop contributions to the @xmath29 vertex in the cross section calculation .",
    "note that the diagrams h ) , i ) , j ) of figure  [ fig : feyn ] are not part of the phenomenological study in  @xcite .",
    "in this section we present the results for @xmath30 and @xmath31 production from the complete diagrammatic 1-loop calculation ( fdc ) and discuss the quality of simpler approximations :    * the effective potential approach ( epa ) , as described above , * the simplified epa with sfermion mixing and bottom / sbottom loop neglected ( ) , based on eqs .",
    "( [ eq : emassmat]-[eq : ealpha ] ) .    in order to give an orientation about the accuracy of the approximations",
    "we show comparisons of the various methods in the different regions of the parameter space .    from the theoretical point of view , the most convenient parameters for the higgs sector are the mass of the cp - odd higgs boson and the ratio @xmath32 . from the experimental point of view",
    "it is more natural to use the mass of the lighter cp - even higgs instead of the formal quantity @xmath17 .",
    "this , however , is technically more complicated for the calculational scheme . in the first part of this discussion we follow the conventional way of presentation and choose @xmath17 as a free input parameter . in the second part we replace @xmath17 in favor of the physical neutral higgs mass",
    "this has the advantage to directly get the theoretical results for the production cross sections for the case that a higgs boson is found and its mass has been determined .    as a first step",
    ", we put together the predictions of the various methods for the physical mass for given and @xmath17 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass1 ] is based on the parameters listed in table  [ tab : par ] .",
    ".parameters used for the numerical analysis .",
    "[ tab : par ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have analyzed also the dependence of the differences between the epa and the fdc predictions on the susy parameters : sfermion and gaugino masses , @xmath33 parameter and sfermion mixing parameters . in most cases",
    "the variation of those parameters does not have a large effect on the size of the differences between the epa and fdc .",
    "the only exception is the gaugino mass , which is completely absent in the epa . for a relatively heavy ( @xmath34 gev )",
    "the increase of @xmath35 causes a slow change of , , ( see figure  [ fig : gcr ] ) .",
    "this effect can be quite dramatic for small @xmath36 gev and @xmath35 around 1 tev , but such low values are however already excluded by the lep1 measurements .",
    "we now turn to the more physical parametrization of the cross sections in terms of the two higgs boson masses and .",
    "this parameterization is more clumsy in the calculations , but it has the advantage of physically well defined input quantities avoiding possible confusions from different renormalization schemes .",
    "technically , @xmath17 is calculated for given , and the other input parameters .",
    "varying ( and other input quantities fixed ) we thus obtain @xmath17 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 as functions of .",
    "the predictions for the cross sections are , however , in general not unique because there can be two solutions for @xmath17 , thus yielding two branches for fixed values of .",
    "the solutions for @xmath17 are shown in figure  [ fig : tbmass ] for the input parameters of table  [ tab : par ] , again for the fdc and the simpler approximations .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the differences between the values obtained in the epa and fdc can reach 20% .",
    "also significant differences can occur for the cross sections , as displayed in figure  [ fig : tbcr ] where the predictions of epa and fdc for the @xmath37 and @xmath38 are plotted as functions of .",
    "the typical size of differences between the methods is 10 - 20% for = 205 gev .",
    "we presented the results from a complete 1-loop diagrammatic calculation in the mssm for the cross sections for neutral higgs production via @xmath0 and @xmath1 , including box diagrams and @xmath39 vertex contributions which were not part of previous studies for higgs searches in the literature .",
    "comparisons between the fdc predictions with the simpler epa approximation have shown that the epa has an accuracy of typically 10 - 20% in the parameter regions where the cross sections are large .",
    "the differences become bigger with increasing energy",
    ". they may be specially important for future high energy @xmath40 colliders .",
    "the use of the physical input variables @xmath41 @xmath42 avoids ambiguities from the definition of @xmath17 in higher order , but the observed differences remain of the same size . for a better accuracy",
