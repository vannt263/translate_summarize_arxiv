    "the notion of _ event counts _ is fundamental in many imaging modalities .",
    "thus , for instance , this notion is used to quantify the reception of gamma photons in nuclear imaging @xcite as well as to describe the formation of optical images in charge coupled devices ( ccd ) @xcite .",
    "confocal microscopy @xcite , astronomical @xcite and turbulent imaging @xcite are additional examples of applications in which the notion of even counts routinely arises . in all these cases ,",
    "working with event counts entails using a specific statistical assumption on the nature of acquired images .",
    "in particular , the images are assumed to be formed as blurred versions of their original counterparts contaminated by poisson noise .",
    "consequently , to recover the original images , the combined effect of the blur and noise needs to be reversed . a novel approach to the solution of this classical inverse problem is proposed in this work .    since in practice",
    ", digital images are discrete and finite - dimensional objects , it seems reasonable to represent the original image @xmath0 along with its measured version @xmath1 by @xmath2 real - valued matrices .",
    "moreover , since in poissonian imaging the values of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 have the interpretation of event counts , the images can be further constrained to be members of the subspace @xmath3 of nonnegative - valued matrices .",
    "formally , @xmath4 additionally , let @xmath5 be a linear operator describing the convolution of @xmath0 with a non - negative mask @xmath6 of some size .",
    "then , the formation of @xmath1 can be formally expressed as @xmath7 where @xmath8 describes the effect of contamination of @xmath9 by poisson noise .",
    "therefore , as was mentioned before , to recover the original image @xmath0 from @xmath1 , the combined effect of @xmath10 in ( [ model ] ) needs to be inverted .",
    "the current arsenal of image restoration approaches to the solution of ( [ model ] ) is relatively broad .",
    "in general , all these methods can be divided into two main groups , where the methods of the first group assume @xmath11 to be identity , whereas the methods of the second group allow it to be a general low - pass filter . within the first group ,",
    "a range of available reconstruction methods take advantage of a _ variance stabilized transformation _ ( vst ) @xcite , which allows the poisson noise in ( [ model ] ) to be transformed into approximately white gaussian noise .",
    "some recent developments in this direction include the works in @xcite , in which wavelet de - noising has been exploited to reject the  gaussianized \" poisson noise .",
    "conceptually similar ideas have been also advocated in @xcite based on more advanced tools of statistical analysis .",
    "the framework of bayesian estimation was exploited in @xcite , where hierarchical ( markovian ) models have been used to describe a priori probabilities of the original images .",
    "although all the above methods can be used to recover an approximation of @xmath0 in ( [ model ] ) , their applicability is restricted to the case of weak blurs , where @xmath11 can be closely approximated by the identity operator @xmath12 . moreover , all these methods depend on vst , whose performance is known to deteriorate considerably in low - count settings  @xcite .",
    "one of the nowadays classical methods of solving ( [ model ] ) for the case of a general @xmath11 was proposed in the beginning of the 1970s in the seminal works of w.  richardson @xcite and l.  luci @xcite .",
    "this method  known as the richardson - lucy ( rl ) algorithm  can be classified as a _ maximum likelihood _ ( ml ) estimator . as a general rule ,",
    "however , ml estimation may result in less accurate and/or stable reconstructions as compared with _",
    "maximum a posteriori _ ( map ) estimation methods based on the bayesian paradigm .",
    "consequently , the rl algorithm has been recently extended under the map estimation framework , resulting in a number of regularized solutions to ( [ model ] ) which differ in the way the original image @xmath0 is modelled .",
    "thus , for example , gaussian models have been exploited in @xcite , while the algorithm in @xcite is based on the total variation model of @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there are conditions on which the above methods can result in erroneous reconstructions ( as will be demonstrated later in the paper ) .    despite the relative simplicity of the rl algorithm",
    ", it still remains one of the most widespread methods used in the current practice of poissonian imaging .",
    "the main advantage of the rl algorithm stems from its nonlinear nature , allowing one to recover the high - frequency components of the original images which are the most affected by blur .",
    "moreover , a closer look at the analytical properties of the rl algorithm reveals the fact that it has a  built - in \" ability to converge to _ sparse _ solutions , and , as a result , the application of the algorithm for the restoration of sparse images should be expected to produce particularly useful reconstructions .",
    "unfortunately , most of the real - life images are not sparse in the spatial domain , in which case the rl algorithm may fail to provide useful results . on the other hand ,",
    "most of such images _ are _ sparse in the domain of a properly designed linear transform @xcite .",
    "consequently , to extend the applicability of the rl algorithm to a wider range of imagery data , it is tempting to find a way to apply the algorithm in the transformed domain , as opposed to the spatial domain .",
    "accordingly , the main contribution of this paper consists in the introduction of a novel approach to the solution of ( [ model ] ) which exploits the above idea .",
    "moreover , it will be shown via an experimental study that the proposed method outperforms a number of alternative algorithms in terms of normalized mean - square error ( nmse ) , ssim quality index @xcite , as well as its stability and computational efficiency .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii provides some necessary details on the rl algorithm .",
    "the statistical models and assumptions underpinning the proposed method are detailed in section iii , while section iv summarizes the main structure of the proposed solution method .",
    "the results of both computed - simulated and real - life experiments are presented in section v. section vi finalizes the paper with a discussion and conclusions .",
    "to establish a necessary foundation for the development and presentation of the proposed method , a brief overview of the rl algorithm is provided first . under the image formation model of ( [ model ] )",
    ", the likelihood function of the measured image @xmath1 can be defined as @xmath13 where the samples @xmath14 of @xmath1 are assumed to be mutually independent .",
    "consequently , defining @xmath15 , the ml estimate @xmath16 of @xmath0 is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 with @xmath19 denoting the standard inner product in @xmath20 .",
    "differentiating @xmath21 with respect to @xmath0 and equating the derivative to zero results in @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes an @xmath2 matrix of ones , the fractional line stands for a point - wise division , and @xmath24 denotes the adjoint of @xmath11 .",
    "note that if @xmath11 represents the operation of 2-d convolution with a positive - valued kernel @xmath25 , then @xmath26 represents the convolution with a spatially reversed version of the same kernel @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath27 is normalized to satisfy @xmath28 , then both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are obviously equal to @xmath23 .",
    "this fact is exploited by the rl algorithm , which recovers an approximation of the original image @xmath0 as a stationary point of the sequence of solutions produced by @xmath31 where the dot stands for a point - wise multiplication , and @xmath32 is the iteration index .    to better understand the nature of the solution produced by the minimization of ( [ rlcostb ] ) , consider the following steps . using the definition of an adjoint operator , the cost functional @xmath21 in ( [ rlcostb ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath33 moreover , since @xmath0 is assumed to be positive valued , the inner product @xmath34 coincides with the @xmath35-norm of @xmath0 defined as @xmath36 . as a result , the cost function @xmath21 in ( [ rlcosta ] ) can be further redefined as @xmath37    a closer look into the two terms in ( [ costl1 ] ) leads to a number of remarkable observations .",
    "first and foremost , the presence of @xmath35-norm in the cost function implies that the solution of ( [ rlcosta ] ) will tend to be sparse @xcite .",
    "_ therefore , the rl algorithm has a  built - in \" ability to converge to sparse solutions .",
    "_ moreover , such solutions are guaranteed to be positive due to the second term in ( [ costl1 ] ) which works akin to a logarithmic barrier ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.11 ) .",
    "this is what makes the rl algorithm to favour the reconstructions which are sparse in the spatial domain .",
    "it goes without saying that the assumption of spatially sparse images may be unacceptable for a variety of natural scenes . for this reason",
    ", the rl algorithm is known to perform reliably in the case of , e.g. , astronomical images @xcite , while its application to piecewise smooth images can produce rather disappointing results @xcite . on the other hand , sparsity is known to be an extremely useful and liable assumption to use for describing the behaviour of the representation coefficients of natural images in the domain of certain linear transforms .",
    "therefore , to extend the applicability of the rl algorithm to the above case , it is imperative to find a way to apply the algorithm directly to the ( sparse ) representation coefficients , rather than to their corresponding images .",
    "a possible variant of such an approach is detailed in the section that follows .    before turning to the description of our method ,",
    "a number of important properties of the rl recursion in ( [ rl ] ) are worth to be mentioned .",
    "in particular , it can be seen from ( [ rl ] ) that the algorithm preserves the positivity of @xmath38 , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath39 is guaranteed to be in @xmath3 provided @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "somewhat less trivial , it can also be shown that the algorithm preserves the mean values of the intermediate solutions , i.e. @xmath42 at each iteration @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "all these properties will play an important role in the proposed method as detailed below .",
    "the approach proposed in this paper is based on the assumption that the original image @xmath0 in ( [ model ] ) can be _ sparsely represented _ in the domain of a linear transformation . in particular , given an overcomplete and dense set @xmath43 of vectors in @xmath20 , we define the synthesis operator @xmath44 to be given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the set of indices of the representation coefficients @xmath47 , with @xmath48 . using this definition of @xmath49 , one can rewrite the model equation ( [ model ] ) as @xmath50 with @xmath51 being a composition of @xmath52 and @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath53 , and @xmath54 being the representation coefficients of @xmath0 in the domain of @xmath49 . in this new format ,",
    "the original problem of reconstruction of @xmath0 is replaced by the problem of estimating its representation coefficients @xmath47 .",
    "needless to say , due to the over - completeness of @xmath49 , the definition of @xmath47 is not unique . this difficultly , however , can be easily overcome by requiring the representation coefficients @xmath47 to be as sparse as possible .",
    "a possible way to quantify the sparseness of @xmath47 is by measuring its @xmath35 norm @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that this measure of sparseness has been successfully used in numerous fields of science , which include signal modeling @xcite , compressed sensing @xcite , independent component analysis and blind source separation @xcite , inverse problems @xcite , signal and image de - noising @xcite , morphological component analysis @xcite together with its earlier version introduced in @xcite .",
    "using the assumptions above , the problem of recovering the original image @xmath0 can be cast into the framework of map estimation , in which case the optimal @xmath56 is found as a solution of the following maximization problem @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 denote the likelihood function and the prior probability of @xmath47 , respectively .    under the assumption of statistical independence ,",
    "the likelihood @xmath58 has the form of @xmath60 one the other hand , congruent to the assumption on minimality of @xmath55 , the representation coefficients are assumed to be _",
    "_ random variables that obey a zero - mean laplacian distribution , _ viz _ @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a scale parameter of the distribution .    using the definitions ( [ like ] ) and ( [ laplace ] ) and applying the standard log - transformation and the negation of sign to ( [ map ] ) , it is straightforward to show that the map estimation problem is equivalent to @xmath63 @xmath64 with @xmath65 being a regularization parameter .",
    "care should be exercised when specifying the domain of definition of @xmath66 in ( [ costb ] ) .",
    "indeed , the likelihood model of ( [ like ] ) interprets the value @xmath67 as the mean of the corresponding random observation @xmath14 .",
    "since , in the case of a poisson distribution , its first and second moments are equal , the values @xmath67 should be assumed to be non - negative ( in accordance with our earlier assumption in ( [ sspace ] ) ) .",
    "thus , the domain of the objective @xmath66 is formally given by @xmath68 which is a convex set .",
    "moreover , as long as @xmath69 and the convolution operator @xmath11 is non - degenerate ( albeit , possibly , ill - conditioned ) , the objective functional @xmath66 is guaranteed to be strictly convex . in this case",
    ", @xmath66 admits a unique minimizer in @xmath70 , which can be found by any optimization algorithm which is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , when either @xmath1 is not strictly positive or @xmath11 possesses a non - trivial null - space , the convexity of @xmath66 is not strict , and , as a result , the existence and uniqueness of its global minimizer can not be a priori guaranteed .",
    "numerous algorithms approaches can be used to minimize the cost functional in ( [ costb ] ) . in this paper",
    ", we propose a different method based on fixed - point iterations . to this end",
    ", we first notice that the first - order optimality condition for ( [ costb ] ) has the following form @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the adjoint of @xmath51 and @xmath73 is an extremum of @xmath66 .",
    "note that , in ( [ firstorder ] ) , the non - differentiability of the absolute value at zero is resolved by letting @xmath74 . as will be shown below",
    ", the latter assumption is rather technical , as it has no impact on the proposed solution .",
    "finally , by rearranging the terms in ( [ firstorder ] ) , one obtains @xmath75 which , in turn , suggests the following fixed - point iteration algorithm @xmath76    the iterative procedure of ( [ fixedpoint ] ) is multiplicative in nature  the fact that has a number of important implications .",
    "first , the zero entries of @xmath47 are preserved by the iteration procedure , which means that if @xmath77 for some @xmath78 , then @xmath79 for all @xmath80 . in this respect",
    ", letting @xmath81 seems to be a reasonable simplification , since the value of the gradient of @xmath55 at zero does not seem to have any influence on the result of the iterative procedure ( [ fixedpoint ] ) .",
    "second , if the values of @xmath47 were allowed to be of an arbitrary sign , it would be generally impossible to guarantee a _ monotone _ convergence of @xmath82 . to overcome this deficiency , in what follows",
    "the representation coefficients @xmath47 will be assumed to be non - negative . moreover ,",
    "if the representation vectors @xmath83 are constrained to be positive - valued as well , it is straightforward to verify that the iterations in ( [ fixedpoint ] ) will preserve the positiveness of @xmath47 .",
    "it is important to note that the above constraints on the sign of @xmath47 and @xmath83 should not be seen as a limitation , since there exists a body of works ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) , which describe the construction of positive - valued representation sets that allows the natural scenes to be represented in terms of both sparse _ and _ positive coefficients .",
    "provided the elements of @xmath83 are positive values , the vector @xmath84 will be positive valued as well , i.e. @xmath85 . in this case ,",
    "( [ fixedpoint ] ) can be rewritten in a more compact form as @xmath86 the iterations in ( [ srl ] ) can be initialized with a constant coefficient vector @xmath87 ( e.g. @xmath88 ) and executed until the relative change @xmath89 drops below a predefined threshold @xmath90 .",
    "the above algorithm will be referred below to as the _ sparse rl _ method , or simply srl .    comparing the recursions in ( [ srl ] ) and ( [ rl ] )",
    ", one can not avoid noting how similar the srl and rl algorithms are .",
    "indeed , replacing @xmath47 and @xmath51 in ( [ srl ] ) by @xmath0 and @xmath11 , respectively , yields an update equation identical to that in ( [ rl ] ) ( up to the element - wise division by @xmath91 in ( [ srl ] ) ) .",
    "moreover , the assumption on the non - negativeness of @xmath47 and @xmath51 made by srl is parallel to the non - negativeness of @xmath0 and @xmath11 exploited by the rl method .",
    "further similarity between rl and srl reveals itself in the objective functions of the two reconstruction methods .",
    "specifically , the objective function in ( [ costb ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 is the @xmath95-weighted @xmath35-norm of the non - negative representation coefficients @xmath47 .",
    "thus , one can see that under the substitution of @xmath47 by @xmath0 , @xmath51 by @xmath11 and @xmath96 , the objective functionals ( [ costbb ] ) and ( [ costl1 ] ) are identical . yet , while minimizing ( [ costl1 ] ) forces the reconstruction of @xmath0 to have a sparse appearance , minimizing ( [ costbb ] ) has the same effect on the representation coefficients . as opposed to the former",
    ", the latter case allows one to recover much broader classes of practical images , as it is demonstrated by the experimental results below .",
    "both one- and two - dimensional data sets have been used to test the performance of the proposed srl algorithm . in the case of 1-d data ,",
    "the srl algorithm was compared against the rl method , while in the case of 2-d data , the comparison was made against the method described in @xcite .",
    "note that , just like srl , the reference method of @xcite belongs to the class of bayesian estimators .",
    "specifically , the method recovers the original image @xmath0 as a maximizer of its posterior probability , computed under the model of ( [ model ] ) and the _ total - variation _ ( tv ) prior .",
    "the maximization can be performed iteratively according to the following update equation @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a regularization parameter , which has been set to be equal to 0.002 as prescribed in @xcite . for the convenience of referencing",
    ", the above algorithm will be referred below to as the rltv method .",
    "to quantitatively compare between the performance of various reconstruction algorithms , two comparison measures have been used .",
    "the first , _ normalized mean - squared error _ ( nmse ) , is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 be an original image and @xmath99 be an estimate of @xmath0 .",
    "then , the nmse can be defined as @xmath100 with @xmath101 being the frobenius matrix norm , and @xmath102 being the operator of expectation . in the current study ,",
    "the expectation was approximated by its corresponding sample mean based on the results of 200 independent trials .",
    "it has been recently argued that the nmse may not be an optimal comparison measure as long as human visual perception is concerned .",
    "for this reason , the structural similarity ( ssim ) index proposed by @xcite was employed as well as an alternative performance metric .",
    "the first part of our experimental study is concerned with the recovery of piece - wise constant signals of length @xmath103 . for this case",
    ", a natural choice would be to define the basis functions @xmath83 to be scaled and spatially shifted versions of a rectangular ( haar ) box .",
    "specifically , let @xmath104 be a ( dyadic ) resolution index , and @xmath105 be defined as @xmath106 =   \\begin{cases } 2^{-j/2 } , & \\mbox { for } 0 \\le n < 2^j - 1 \\\\ 0 ,           & \\mbox { for } 2^j \\le",

    "n]\\ ] ] be the operator of ( causal ) circular shift by @xmath111 points .",
    "obviously , for each @xmath112 there are a total of @xmath103 non - repetitive shifts .",
    "consistent with the notations standard in wavelet theory , let @xmath113 denote the function @xmath112 ( circularly ) shifted by @xmath111 points to the right ( in which case @xmath114 can be viewed as a rectangular box function supported on @xmath115 $ ] ) .",
    "moreover , let @xmath116 be a matrix of size @xmath117 , whose columns are formed by functions @xmath114 with @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "in this case , given an arbitrary vector of representation coefficients @xmath47 of size @xmath120 , its corresponding signal @xmath0 can be synthesized as @xmath121 .    the _ dictionary _",
    "@xmath122 constructed above is severely overcomplete , which has the disadvantage of high computational complexity associated with the computations of @xmath123 and @xmath124 . to improve the computational efficiency ,",
    "the index @xmath109 was restricted to four resolution levels , viz .",
    "@xmath125 , and @xmath126 . as a result , the size of @xmath49 was equal to @xmath127 for @xmath128 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath47 used for the synthesis of test signals had about @xmath129 % of non - zero entries , drawn from a uniform distribution .",
    "the blurring artifact was simulated by convolving the test images with a gaussian kernel @xmath11 whose -3 db cut - off frequency was set to be equal to @xmath130 .",
    "the maxima of the resulting signals were set to two different values , namely 256 and 32 , in order to simulate high- and low - count detection scenarios , respectively . as a final step ,",
    "the blurred signals were contaminated by poisson noise ( see the second subplots in fig .  [ fig1 ] and fig .  [ fig2 ] for typical examples of data signals ) .",
    "next , the rl and srl algorithms were applied to the synthesized data signals with @xmath131 .",
    "unfortunately , _ no _ monotonous convergence in nmse could be achieved in the case of the rl algorithm .",
    "the steady - sate estimates obtained using this classical method were unacceptably noisy ( see the fourth subplots of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for typical examples of the rl estimates ) . for this reason",
    ", it was decided to terminate the rl estimations before the steady - state was reached , at the point when the nmse value was minimized .",
    "( note that such nmse - optimal rl estimates are impossible to compute in real - life scenarios , as their computation requires knowing the original images . )",
    "the srl algorithm , on the other hand , produced monotonous convergence in nmse , producing substantially smaller values of nmse as compared to the case of rl estimation . for the case of high- and low - count scenarios ,",
    "some typical reconstruction results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , respectively , from which the superiority of the proposed method can be easily appreciated .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , as predicted by the theory , the rl algorithm attempts to arrive at a sparse estimate of the signal of interest , which contradicts the piece - wise smooth nature of our test signals .",
    "the srl method , on the other hand , require the sparsity of the representation coefficients , which appears to be a much more realistic assumption for the case at hand .",
    "a quantitative comparison of the two reconstruction algorithms is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , which depicts the values of nmse produced by the rl and srl methods as a function of the number of iterations .",
    "it is important to emphasize that each value of the nmse in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is a result of averaging the errors obtained in a series of independent trials , where both the true signals and noises were drawn randomly . observing fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , one can see that srl results in considerably lower values of the nmse as compared to the case of rl .",
    "as well , it converges _ monotonously _ to a steady - state solution after a relatively small number of iterations . on the other hand ,",
    "the convergence of rl is not monotone  the fact that necessitates termination of the algorithm after a predefined number of iterations . needless to say , determining a proper number of iterations is a data - dependent and somewhat esoteric task in practice .      in the second part of the experimental study , the srl algorithm is examined using imaging data . as reference methods , the standard rl method as well as the rltv algorithm ( as specified by ( [ rltv ] ) )",
    "are employed to assess the performance of srl in a comparative way .",
    "note that as neither rl nor rltv could provide acceptable steady - state results , their iterations needed to be terminated at an earlier point . in particular , the iterations were terminated at the point when the nmse produced by the algorithms reached a minimum value .",
    "it is important to reiterate that such  mse - optimal \" termination rule is not realizable in real - life scenarios where the original images are unknown .",
    "hence , the rl and rltv estimates demonstrated below represent the best possible result which could be achieved using these reconstruction methods .",
    "implementation of the srl algorithm relies on the availability of a dictionary of positive - valued atoms @xmath83 . in the 2-d experiments , we explore two possible approaches to the definition of such a dictionary , viz .",
    "unsupervised and supervised .",

    "in the current paper , a new regularized version of the rl algorithm has been presented , which is advantageous in a number of ways .",
    "first , the proposed method is general in its formulation .",
    "the latter allows applying the same reconstruction procedure to a number of different settings , such as image de - noising or image enhancement through deconvolution .",
    "attuned to deal with poissonian noises , the method can therefore be applied for the reconstruction of imagery data produced by many important image modalities , including optical , microscopic , turbulent , and nuclear imaging , just to name a few . moreover , whilst many alternative reconstruction methods take advantage of certain simplifying assumptions about the noise nature , the proposed technique is optimized to deal with the realistic noise model at hand .    another important advantage of the proposed method consists in the generality of the prior model used to describe the nature of true images .",
    "specifically , the images have been assumed to admit a sparse representation in the domain of a properly chosen linear transform .",
    "note that the above _ a priori _ model is nowadays considered to be a standard model in numerous applications of the theory of sparse representations .",
    "this is what allows the srl algorithm to recover piecewise smooth images ",
    "the task impossible to accomplish by means of the standard rl procedure for its property to favour _ spatially _ sparse reconstructions .",
    "yet another critical advantage of the proposed srl algorithm is in its algorithmic structure , which allows solving non - smooth optimization problems at the computational cost of a steepest descent procedure .",
    "consequently , the computational load required by the proposed method is relatively small , which allows the method to be applied for the solution of large - scale problems and/or for processing of large data sets .",

    "<S> , there exists a range of solution methods which are based on the principles originating from the fixed - point algorithm of richardson and lucy ( rl ) . in this paper , we provide conceptual and experimental proof that such methods tend to converge to sparse solutions , which makes them applicable only to those images which can be represented by a relatively small number of non - zero samples in the spatial domain . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the set of such images is relatively small , which restricts the applicability of rl - type methods . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> virtually all practical images admit sparse representations in the domain of a properly designed linear transform . to take advantage of this fact , it is therefore tempting to modify the rl algorithm so as to make it recover representation coefficients , rather than the values of their associated image . </S>",
