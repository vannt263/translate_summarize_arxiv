    "metal - line absorption systems observed in the spectra of background qsos provide a unique probe of the chemical content and dynamics of gas at large galactic distances .",
    "comparison of galaxies and mgii absorption systems along common lines of sight has demonstrated that ( 1 ) mgii absorption systems arise in extended gaseous envelopes of galaxies and ( 2 ) the gaseous extent of galaxies ( at very low column densities ) stretches for many times the optical extent of galaxies ( bergeron & boiss 1991 ; lanzetta & bowen 1990 , 1992 ; steidel 1993 ) . but while occasional galaxies associated with  absorption systems have been reported by various authors ( bergeron et al .",
    "1994 ; lanzetta et al .  1995 ; steidel et al .  1997 ; churchill et al .",
    "1999 ) , no uniform sample of galaxies and  absorption systems has yet been applied to systematically investigate statistical properties of extended -absorbing gas around galaxies .",
    "in contrast to mgii absorption systems , civ absorption systems probe highly - ionized , low - density regions ( wolfe 1983 ; bergeron & stasiska 1986 ) , which suggests that gas traced by civ is typically at much larger galactic distances than gas traced by mgii .",
    "hence civ absorption systems may bear importantly on understanding the processes of galaxy formation and evolution that deposit chemically enriched material far from galaxies .    over the past several years",
    ", we have been conducting an imaging and spectroscopic survey of faint galaxies in fields of hubble space telescope ( hst ) spectroscopic target qsos ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1995 ; chen et al .",
    "1998 , 2001 , hereafter papers i and ii ) .",
    "the goal of the survey is to determine the gaseous extent of galaxies and the origin of qso absorption systems by directly comparing galaxies and qso absorption systems along common lines of sight . as a result of the survey ,",
    "we have so far identified 352 galaxies of apparent magnitude @xmath9 and redshift @xmath10 , 230  absorption systems of redshift @xmath11 , and 36  absorption systems of redshift @xmath12 in 24 qso fields .",
    "impact parameters of the galaxies to the qso lines of sight range from @xmath13 to @xmath14 kpc .",
    "our galaxy and absorber sample provides for the first time the opportunity to study statistical properties of -absorbing gas around galaxies .",
    "here we present results of the study .",
    "first , we show that  absorption systems are strongly clustered around galaxies on velocity scales of @xmath0  and impact parameter scales of @xmath15 kpc but not on larger velocity or impact parameter scales .",
    "this demonstrates that civ absorption systems are associated with galaxies and strongly suggests that civ - absorbing gas generally arises in individual galaxies , rather than in a diffuse medium that is loosely associated with galaxy groups , clusters , or other large - scale structures .",
    "next , adopting measurements of galaxy properties presented in papers i and ii ( which include @xmath2-band luminosity , surface brightness , and disk - to - bulge ratio ) , we examine how properties of the absorption systems depend on properties of the galaxies . on the basis of 14 galaxy and absorber pairs and 36 galaxies that do not produce corresponding  absorption lines to within sensitive upper limits",
    ", we find that : ( 1 ) galaxies of a range of morphological type and luminosity appear to possess extended  gaseous envelopes of radius @xmath16 kpc , with abrupt boundaries between the civ absorbing and non - absorbing regions .",
    "( 2 ) the extent of -absorbing gas around galaxies scales with galaxy @xmath2-band luminosity as @xmath17 but does not depend strongly on galaxy surface brightness , redshift , or morphological type . and ( 3 ) the covering factor of  clouds within @xmath5 kpc of galaxies is nearly unity , but there is a large scatter in the mean number of clouds encountered along the line of sight . after scaling to the luminosity of an @xmath6 galaxy",
    ", we find that 13 of 14 galaxies of impact parameter @xmath18 kpc are associated with corresponding  absorption lines , while only one of 36 galaxies of impact parameter @xmath8 kpc are associated with corresponding  absorption lines .",
    "our results indicate that galaxies of a wide range of luminosity and morphological type are surrounded by chemically enriched gas that extends for at least @xmath5 kpc .",
    "given such a large extent , we consider it unlikely that the absorbing clouds were ejected from the primary galaxies by stellar winds or galactic fountains .",
    "rather , we conclude that the absorbing clouds were probably produced at large galactic radii by either population iii stars or by progressive accretion of gas from surrounding satellite galaxies . if the clouds were formed by satellite accretion , then the abrupt boundaries between the  absorbing and non - absorbing regions suggest that galaxies form through dissipational accretion , and the lack of a strong redshift dependence of the extent of -absorbing gas around galaxies suggests that the typical separation between satellites and primary galaxies is larger than 100 @xmath19 kpc .",
    "we adopt a standard friedmann cosmology of dimensionless hubble constant @xmath20 and deceleration parameter @xmath21 throughout .",
    "the analysis is based on observations of our ongoing imaging and spectroscopic survey of faint galaxies in fields of hst spectroscopic target qsos ( lanzetta et al .  1995 ; papers i and ii ; lanzetta et al .",
    "2001 in preparation ) . as a result of the survey ,",
    "we have so far identified 352 galaxies of apparent magnitude @xmath9 and redshift @xmath10 , 230   absorption systems of redshift @xmath11 , and 36  absorption systems of redshift @xmath12 in 24 qso fields .",
    "impact parameters of the galaxies to the qso lines of sight range from @xmath13 to @xmath14 kpc .    using the hubble space telescope with the wide field and planetary camera 2 , we have also obtained high - quality optical - wavelength images of 142 of the galaxies in 19 fields , which we have used to measure galaxy @xmath2-band luminosity , effective radius , surface brightness , inclination and orientation of the disk component , axial ratio of the bulge component , and disk - to - bulge ratio by means of a two - dimensional surface brightness profile analysis .",
    "these measurements are described and presented in papers i and ii .",
    "in this section , we examine how properties of the  absorption systems depend on properties of the galaxies .      to establish the statistical relationship between galaxies and absorption systems , we measured the galaxy  absorber cross - correlation function @xmath22 as it depends on line - of - sight velocity separation @xmath23 and impact parameter separation @xmath24 . figure 1 shows @xmath22 determined from 352 galaxies and 36  absorption systems .",
    "the bin size in velocity separation is 250 , and the bin size in impact parameter separation is indicated in each panel .",
    "a total of 563 galaxy and absorber pairs enter into the analysis , of which 153 are of impact parameter separation @xmath7 kpc , 148 are of @xmath25 kpc , and 262 are of @xmath26 kpc .",
    "error bars indicate 1 @xmath27 poisson counting fluctuations .",
    "figure 1 indicates a statistically significant excess of galaxy and absorber pairs at velocity separations @xmath0  and impact parameter separations @xmath15 kpc , but no excess at larger velocities or impact parameters .",
    "specifically , the bin spanning @xmath28  and @xmath7 kpc is expected to contain @xmath29 pairs but is observed to contain 9 pairs , which indicates that the excess is established at the @xmath30 level of significance .",
    "the strong signal on small velocity and impact parameter scales demonstrates that  absorption systems are associated with galaxies .",
    "further , the lack of signal on larger velocity and impact parameter scales strongly suggests that -absorbing gas generally arises in individual galaxies , rather than in a diffuse medium that is loosely associated with galaxy groups , clusters , or other large - scale structures .      to identify galaxy and absorber pairs that are likely",
    "to be physically associated with each other , we followed procedures similar to those described in paper i. first , we considered a galaxy and absorber pair of velocity separation @xmath23 and impact parameter separation @xmath24 to be physically associated if @xmath31 . in cases",
    "where more than one galaxy could be paired with one absorber under this criterion , we chose the galaxy of smallest impact parameter to form the pair .",
    "next , we excluded galaxy and absorber pairs within 3000  of the background qsos ( because such galaxies and absorbers are likely to be associated with the qsos ) . finally , we measured @xmath32 upper limits to absorption equivalent widths of galaxies that are not paired with corresponding absorbers , retaining only those measurements with @xmath32 upper limits satisfying @xmath33  .",
    "following these procedures , we identified 14 galaxy and  absorber pairs and 36 galaxies that do not produce corresponding  absorption to within sensitive upper limits .",
    "redshifts of the galaxy and absorber pairs range from @xmath34 to 0.8920 with a median of @xmath35 , and impact parameters of the galaxy and absorber pairs range from @xmath36 to @xmath37 kpc with a median of @xmath38 kpc .",
    "the @xmath2-band luminosities of the galaxies range from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "a complete list of the measured properties of the galaxies and  absorbers is presented in paper ii .      to determine the extent of -absorbing gas around galaxies",
    ", we examined the relationship between rest - frame  @xmath41 equivalent width @xmath42 and galaxy impact parameter @xmath24 .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath42 versus @xmath24 for the 14 galaxy and absorber pairs and the 36 galaxies that do not produce corresponding  absorption to within sensitive upper limits .",
    "circles represent early - type elliptical or s0 galaxies , triangles represent early - type spiral galaxies , and squares represent late - type spiral galaxies .",
    "galaxy morphology is determined on the basis of the integrated light ratio of the disk and bulge surface brightness profiles , as described in papers i and ii .",
    "open points with arrows indicate 3 @xmath27 upper limits to @xmath42 for galaxies that do not produce corresponding  absorption lines .",
    "figure 2 exhibits three interesting points : first , 12 of 18 galaxies ( 67% ) of impact parameter @xmath43 kpc are associated with corresponding  absorption lines , while only two of 32 galaxies ( 6% ) of impact parameter @xmath44 kpc are associated with corresponding  absorption lines . evidently , there are abrupt boundaries between the  absorbing and non - absorbing regions of galaxies .",
    "second , unlike the situation for mgii- and -absorbing gas around galaxies , there is no clear trend for rest - frame equivalent width @xmath42 to be progressively stronger at smaller impact parameter @xmath24 .",
    "third , galaxies associated with corresponding  absorption lines span a wide range of morphological type and luminosity . specifically , two of the 14 absorbing galaxies are elliptical or s0 galaxies and 12 are spiral galaxies , and three of the 14 absorbing galaxies are of luminosity @xmath45 , seven are of @xmath46 , and four are of @xmath47 .",
    "apparently , galaxies of a range of morphological type and luminosity possess extended  gaseous envelopes of radius @xmath16 kpc , with abrupt boundaries between the absorbing and non - absorbing regions .      to determine how properties of the  absorption systems depend on properties of the galaxies , we examined the relationship between rest - frame  @xmath41 equivalent width @xmath42 and galaxy impact parameter @xmath24 scaling for various properties ( luminosity , surface brightness , and redshift ) of the galaxies .",
    "motivated by the apparent abrupt boundary between the   absorbing and non - absorbing regions and the apparent lack of a @xmath42 versus @xmath24 anti - correlation described in   2.3 , we modeled the distribution of  clouds in the extended gaseous envelopes of galaxies by uniform spheres of radius that depends on some property of the galaxy",
    ". then the number @xmath48 of -absorbing clouds intercepted along the line of sight is proportional to the path length through the sphere : @xmath49^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the number density per unit length of the clouds , @xmath51 is the radius of the sphere , and @xmath52 is some property of the galaxy . because equivalent width is correlated with the number of individual absorbing components intercepted along the line of sight ( wolfe 1986 ; york et al .",
    "1986 ; petitjean & bergeron 1994 ) , we take @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the equivalent width of a typical absorbing component . combining equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the  equivalent width @xmath42 expected at impact parameter @xmath24 is given by @xmath55^{1/2 } & \\rho { \\lesssim}r(x ) \\\\ 0                              & \\rho { \\gtrsim}r(x ) , \\\\",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] as a function of some property of the galaxy @xmath52 .",
    "first , we established a fiducial fit of the model described by equation ( 2 ) to the observations for the case in which the radius of the sphere does not depend on any property of the galaxy , i.e.  for @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the absorbing radius of the galaxy .",
    "following procedures described in paper i and substituting @xmath42 for the dependent variable ( instead of @xmath58 as in paper i ) , we solved for @xmath59 , @xmath57 , and the `` cosmic scatter '' @xmath60 using a likelihood analysis .",
    "the results are summarized in row 1 of table 1 , which lists @xmath61 , @xmath57 , @xmath60 , and an estimate of goodness of fit @xmath62 that is equivalent to a reduced @xmath63 with upper limits properly taken into account .",
    "next , we repeated the fitting allowing the radius @xmath51 to scale with galaxy @xmath2-band luminosity @xmath64 as @xmath65 where @xmath57 is the characteristic absorbing radius of an @xmath6 galaxy .",
    "the results are summarized in row 2 of table 1 .",
    "after accounting for galaxy @xmath2-band luminosity , @xmath62 is significantly improved with respect to the fiducial fit , and @xmath66 which indicates that the dependence between @xmath51 and @xmath64 is established at the 5 @xmath27 level of significance .",
    "the characteristic radius is @xmath67 this result applies over the @xmath2-band luminosities @xmath68 spanned by the observations .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath42 versus @xmath24 for the 14 galaxy and absorber pairs and the 36 galaxies that do not produce corresponding  absorption to within sensitive upper limits after scaling for galaxy @xmath2-band luminosity .",
    "the abrupt boundary between the  absorbing and non - absorbing regions is more evident in figure 3 than in figure 2 .",
    "specifically , after scaling for galaxy @xmath2-band luminosity , 14 of 15 ( 93% ) of galaxies of impact parameter @xmath69 kpc are associated with corresponding  absorption lines , while _ no _ galaxies of impact parameter @xmath70 kpc produce corresponding  absorption to within sensitive upper limits .",
    "a likelihood analysis indicates that the covering factor @xmath71 of c iv - absorbing gas around galaxies approaches unity at impact parameters @xmath72 kpc , with a @xmath73 lower bound of @xmath74 . the solid curve in figure 3 shows the best - fit uniform sphere model .",
    "next , we repeated the fitting substituting galaxy surface brightness ( at the half - light radius ) @xmath75 and redshift @xmath76 , respectively , for galaxy @xmath2-band luminosity .",
    "the results are summarized in rows 3 and 4 of table 1 .",
    "after accounting for surface brightness or redshift , the scaling exponent @xmath77 is indistinguishable from zero , and there is no significant improvement in @xmath62 .",
    "we conclude that the c iv extent of galaxies does not depend strongly on galaxy mean surface brightness or redshift .",
    "this result applies over surface brightnesses @xmath78 mag arcsec@xmath79 and redshifts @xmath80 spanned by the observations .",
    "results of the likelihood analysis can also be used to estimate the mean number of  clouds intercepted along a line of sight through a galaxy .",
    "given our estimates of the cosmic scatter @xmath60 and the typical absorption equivalent width per absorbing component per unit length @xmath61 and assuming poisson counting statistics , so that @xmath60 is related to @xmath54 by @xmath81 we find based on the results presented in row 2 of table 1 that a line of sight through the center of an @xmath6 galaxy encounters on average @xmath82  absorbing clouds of equivalent width @xmath83  .",
    "the primary results of the analysis are as follows : ( 1 ) galaxies of a range of morphological type and luminosity appear to possess extended  gaseous envelopes of radius @xmath16 kpc , with abrupt boundaries between the civ absorbing and non - absorbing regions .",
    "( 2 ) the extent of -absorbing gas around galaxies scales with galaxy @xmath2-band luminosity as @xmath84 but does not depend strongly on galaxy surface brightness , redshift , or morphological type . and ( 3 ) the covering factor of  clouds within @xmath5 kpc of galaxies is nearly unity , but there is a large scatter in the mean number of clouds encountered along the line of sight . apparently , _ galaxies of a wide range of luminosity and morphological type are surrounded by chemically - enriched gas are both for absorbers of neutral hydrogen column density @xmath85 and both systems exhibit chemical abundance that approaches the typical solar values ( bergeron et al .",
    "1994 ; chen & prochaska 2000 ) .",
    "these measurements , however , can not be considered representative of the majority of qso absorption systems at low redshifts , because of an apparent selection bias .",
    "because observations of qso absorption systems at high redshifts show a wide range of metallicity , we believe that qso absorption systems at low redshifts also have a range of metallicity .",
    "the absorbers in our sample have been identified from random lines of sight .",
    "we therefore expect that statistical properties of the absorbers in our sample are comparable to statistical properties of all low - redshift qso absorption systems .",
    "namely , there exists a range of chemical abundance in our absorber sample . ] that extends for at least @xmath86 kpc_.    by combining results of previous studies of extended mgii , , and gas around galaxies ( derived by analysis of qso absorption systems ) , we can establish a schematic picture of the structure of extended gas around galaxies : a typical @xmath6 galaxy is surrounded by high column density gas of radius a few tens kpc ( e.g.  van gorkom 1993 ) , which , because of its high density , remains mostly neutral .",
    "the gas becomes gradually ionized as the gas density decreases with increasing galactic radius .",
    "low - ionization species , such as singly ionized magnesium mgii , become the dominant observational signature out to @xmath87 50 @xmath19 kpc ( e.g.  bergeron & boiss 1991 ) . as the density continues to decline at larger galactic radii ,",
    "the gas becomes still more highly ionized .",
    "high - ionization species , such as triply ionized carbon , become the dominant observational signature out to @xmath87 100 @xmath19 kpc , at neutral hydrogen column densities @xmath88  ( this paper ) .",
    "the tenuous gas continues to extend to at least @xmath87 180 @xmath19 kpc , at neutral hydrogen column densities at least as low as @xmath89  ( papers i and ii ) .",
    "this picture applies to galaxies of a wide range of luminosity and morphological type .",
    "establishing the origin of the chemically enriched gas at large galactic radii is important for understanding the processes of galaxy formation and evolution that deposit chemically enriched material far from galaxies .",
    "here we consider two possible scenarios for the origin of this gas : ( 1 ) that the gas is driven out of the galaxies by strong galactic winds and ( 2 ) that the gas was produced at large galactic radii .    in the first scenario ( which is known as the galactic fountain model ) , hot gas",
    "is brought to large galactic distances by violent supernova explosions , forms cold clouds through subsequent radiative cooling , and falls back to the center of the galaxy ( corbelli & salpeter 1988 ) .",
    "comparing with the results of our analysis , we find that the galactic fountain model is unlikely to account for extended  gas around galaxies for the following reasons : first , hot gas driven by supernova explosion can reach to at most @xmath87 20 kpc ( e.g.  corbelli & salpeter 1988 ) before it completely escapes the galaxy , but our analysis indicates that -absorbing gas extends to @xmath87 100 @xmath19 kpc .",
    "second , the supernova explosion rate varies significantly between galaxies of different morphological types , but our analysis suggests that galaxies of all morphological types possess extended -absorbing gas to large radii .",
    "third , given a fixed initial flow speed , the ejected gas may reach larger galactic radii from within smaller galaxies , which is at odds with the scaling relation of our analysis that the  gaseous extent increases with galaxy luminosity .    in the second scenario ,",
    "chemically enriched gas is deposited at large radii either by the first generation stars ( population iii ) or through progressive accretion of gas from surrounding satellite galaxies .",
    "but because the pregalactic enrichment due to population iii stars is strongly constrained by the metallicity of population ii stars to be less than @xmath90 ( carr , bond , & arnett 1984 ) and because observations show that there is already a wide range of metallicity in high - redshift qso absorption systems ( e.g.  rauch 1998 ) , we conclude that population iii stars can not explain all of the  absorbing clouds at large radii , although they may contribute to some of them . on the other hand , theoretical analysis of an accreting satellite model",
    "has shown that chemically enriched gas may be stripped out of the surrounding satellites through tidal interaction or may be ejected from the satellites due to supernova explosions to form absorbing clouds at large radii of the primary galaxy ( wang 1993 ) . supporting evidence is found from observations of nearby spiral galaxies , which shows that there exists at least one satellite around each milky way type galaxy ( zaritsky et al .",
    "in addition ,  21 cm analysis of local dwarf spheroidals suggests that the presence of satellite galaxies may contribute to extended gas in galactic halos ( blitz & robishaw 2000 ) .",
    "we believe that it is therefore likely that accreting satellites may account for chemically enriched gas at large galactic distances , which has implications for the dynamics of absorbing gas clouds as follows :    first , for an isothermal sphere , the density of accreted gas decreases with radius @xmath91 .",
    "but because of dissipational collisions , absorbing clouds may gradually lose angular momentum during the cooling process and spiral down to the primary galaxies , causing the density of accreted gas to fall off more rapidly than @xmath91 ( silk & norman 1981 ) .",
    "it appears that the abrupt boundary between the civ absorbing and non - absorbing regions apparent in figure 3 supports a sharp steepening in the number density of -absorbing clouds in the outer gaseous envelopes of galaxies .",
    "fitting @xmath42 versus @xmath24 of figure 3 with a single power - law model @xmath92 yields @xmath93 , which implies a density distribution @xmath94 ( see lanzetta & bowen 1990 ) .",
    "the dotted line in figure 3 shows the best - fit power - law model .",
    "we conclude that the abrupt boundaries the civ absorbing and non - absorbing regions of galaxies is indicative of dissipational formation processes of galaxies .",
    "second , our results indicate that the extent of -absorbing gas does not depend strongly on galaxy redshift , which implies that  gaseous envelopes of galaxies are essentially static over a large cosmic time interval . given our estimate in equation ( 7 ) of the average number of clouds along a line of sight through the center of an @xmath6 galaxy and adopting a velocity dispersion @xmath95  of a typical @xmath6 galaxy",
    ", we estimate that the collision time between -absorbing clouds is @xmath96 yr . in comparison ,",
    "the dynamical time for the clouds to fall through the gravitational potential of a galaxy is @xmath97 yr . unless the gaseous envelopes of galaxies are continually supplied with matter or energy , it is clear that the accreted gas clouds will rapidly decay to lower orbits , resulting in smaller gaseous cross sections with time .",
    "this directly contradicts our observations .",
    "a solution to this problem may be that satellites at large galactic radii provide a constant supply of fresh gas .",
    "we therefore conclude that if -absorbing clouds are formed through dissipational accretion of gas from surrounding satellites , the mean separation between the satellites and the primary galaxies may be larger than 100 @xmath19 kpc .",
