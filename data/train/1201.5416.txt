    "cold atomic gases are of interest to physicists because the fundamental behavior of quantum matter can be investigated in such systems . after bose - einstein condensates",
    "@xcite and degenerate fermi gases @xcite were created , fano - feshbach resonances were used to tune the interaction between atoms and to make molecules at ultracold temperatures . since those early developments , these resonances have become essential for manipulating ultracold gases @xcite .",
    "fano - feshbach resonances in bose - fermi mixtures sparked research interest later @xcite , because of the rich internal structure and the anisotropic interaction of heteronuclear feshbach molecules .",
    "loading fermionic heteronuclear molecules into optical lattices reduces their inelastic collisions and extends their lifetimes @xcite .",
    "these experiments have motivated the development of theories to describe the dynamical processes of ultracold gases that occur during field ramps across a fano - feshbach resonance , which have been carried out from the perspectives of both many - body and few - body physics , for bose - einstein condensates and two - component fermi gases @xcite .",
    "however it has been challenging to describe the magneto - association of feshbach molecules formed from a bose - fermi mixture .",
    "this article explores the spectrum and dynamics of three or four trapped atoms and shows how a few - body formulation can obtain accurate solutions of the system without making the standard approximations of many - body theory .",
    "this formulation provides an explicit representation of the avoided crossings responsible for interconversion between atomic states in a bose - fermi mixture and fermionic molecular states .",
    "our results directly apply to optical lattice experiments with a few particles on one site , and could also be applied to larger bose - fermi mixtures through a frequency rescaling as in @xcite .",
    "the calculated dynamics provide a few - body perspective on the process of magneto - association of feshbach molecules as varying degrees of adiabaticity and diabaticity .    specifically , to describe the behavior of an ultracold bose - fermi mixture from a few - body perspective in the vicinity of a fano - feshbach resonance , the spectrum is computed for two systems : one consisting of two bosons and one fermion ( bbf ) and the other consisting of two bosons and two fermions ( bbff ) .",
    "although the one boson and two fermion system is also a subsystem of the four body system(bbff ) , since it will not provide information of the trimer , we did not explore its property . in each system , interactions occur only through a short - range potential . to carry out this study for a concrete example ,",
    "we take @xmath0 as the boson and @xmath1 as the fermion .",
    "the s - wave scattering length @xmath2 characterizing the short - range interaction between a boson and a fermion pair is tuned in the standard manner @xcite .",
    "this model allows us to explore the magneto - association of fermionic molecules near a broad fano - feshbach resonance .",
    "our solution of the few - body problem in this universal regime gives various properties accurately , including energy levels and the ramped time - dependent dynamics of the full quantum mechanical system .",
    "this type of analysis enables a detailed understanding of the global topology of the spectrum .",
    "the transition probabilities of this system into alternative possible final configurations are quantitatively predicted , for the case in which interactions change with time , as in field - ramp experiments @xcite .",
    "eigenfunctions and eigenenergies for the few - body hamiltonian [ eq.([hamiltonian ] ) ] are determined using a variational calculation that utilizes a correlated - gaussian basis @xcite .",
    "this method has been previously used to treat the two - component fermion system @xcite and identical boson system @xcite .",
    "after determination of the adiabatic spectrum , the time - dependent schrdinger equation is solved numerically using the diabatic - by - sector method @xcite .",
    "the few - body hamiltonian adopted has only pairwise interactions between bosons and fermions in an isotropic harmonic trap : @xmath3 where b denotes boson , f denotes fermion , and the interparticle potential is @xmath4 , i.e. , an attractive gaussian . the width @xmath5 of the gaussian is fixed , and the depth @xmath6 is tuned to produce the desired two - body scattering length @xmath2 .",
    "the boson - fermion reduced mass @xmath7 , defined as @xmath8 , is half of the mass unit in our calculation . to obtain results independent of the details of the model potential , the range of the potential is limited to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the trap length based on this reduced mass . in the present calculation , @xmath11 is used .",
    "the forms of the wave functions represented by this correlated gaussian basis are listed in table [ gaussianbasis ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     another possible source of discrepancy is the fact that many levels have avoided crossings that are not sufficiently well isolated , thus invalidating the landau - zener model .",
    "this error source differs from the first one in the sense that the second considers the effect of several crossings at the same time , while the first error source considers only isolated two - level crossings .",
    "in addition , considering our calculation s attractive gaussian model potential , we point out that this potential corresponds to a specific three - body parameter which controls the trimer s size and binding energy . in our calculation , the three body parameter @xmath12 is defined as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the trimer s binding energy at unitarity without trap , and @xmath15 is the three body reduced mass of the trimer @xmath16 . for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bose - fermi mixture , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , where the dimensionless parameter has the value @xmath19 in our units . for another boson - fermion interaction model potential ,",
    "if it is within the same @xmath20 range and has the same dimensionless three body parameter @xmath21 , it will agree with the spectra and dynamics from our calculation near unitarity ( unless it is too far from unitarity , in which case the finite range correction of the potential is not negligible . )",
    "three and four - body problems remain fundamental and challenging . this study has presented an accurate numerical solution of the spectrum and dynamics of three and four - body bose - fermi mixtures in a trap in the vicinity of a fano - feshbach resonance .",
    "even though the spectrum presents a rich structure of avoided crossings , a simple landau - zener model approximately describes the dynamics of unidirectional ramps and clarifies the relevant characteristic ramping speeds .",
    "the spectrum and dynamics are of immediate relevance to optical lattice experiments .",
    "these would allow access to physics that can not be probed in a two - body system , such as trimer - atom interactions and dimer - dimer interactions .",
    "also , the system of two bosons and two spin - polarized fermions in a trap exhibits many of the ingredients of the fano - feshbach resonances that form fermionic dipole molecules . in that sense ,",
    "our results provide a few - body perspective on many - body bose - fermi mixture experiments carried out at ultracold temperatures .",
    "we thank jose dincao , jia wang , yujun wang for discussion about the numerical technique as well as the connection to analytical models .",
    "we also thank shinichi watanabe and tomotake yamakoshi for providing deep insight into of the stochastic phase - space sampling model .",
    "this work has been supported in part by the nsf ."
