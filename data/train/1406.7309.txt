    "klein s model of hyperbolic space is well known to geometers .",
    "the underlying set is , in the planar case , the interior of an ellipse , and in the three - dimensional case , the interior of an ellipsoid .",
    "the hyperbolic geodesics are represented by euclidean straight lines and the distance between two distinct points is defined as a constant times the logarithm of the cross ratio of the quadruple formed by this pair of points together with the two intersection points of the euclidean straight line that joins them with the boundary of the ellipsoid , taken in the natural order .",
    "a much less known fact is that klein also gave formulae for the distance in spherical and in euclidean geometry using the cross ratio , taking instead of the ellipse ( or ellipsoid ) other kinds of conics . in the case of euclidean geometry ,",
    "the conic is degenerate . in this way , the formulae that define the three geometries of constant curvature are of the same type , and the constructions of the three geometries are hereby done in a unified way in the realm of projective geometry .",
    "this is the main theme of klein s two papers _ on the so - called non - euclidean geometry , i _ and _ ii _ ( @xcite @xcite ) of klein .    in this paper , we review and comment on these two papers .",
    "klein s construction was motivated by an idea of cayley .",
    "we shall recall and explain this idea of cayley and its developments by klein .",
    "let us note right away that although klein borrowed this idea from cayley , he followed , in using it , a different path .",
    "he even interpreted calyey s idea in a manner so different from what the latter had in mind that cayley misunderstood what klein was aiming for , and thought that the latter was mistaken .",
    "cayley did not understand klein s claim that the cross ratio is independent of the euclidean underlying geometry , and therefore he disagreed with klein s assertion that his construction of the three geometries of constant curvature was based only on projective notions ; cf .  [ s : cayley ] .",
    "] in fact , cayley s interest was not in non - euclidean geometry ; it was rather to show the supremacy of projective geometry over euclidean geometry , by producing the euclidean metric by purely projective methods .",
    "we shall comment on this fact in  [ s : second - p ] below .",
    "the two papers by klein were written in 1871 and 1872 , just before klein wrote his _ erlangen program _",
    "manifesto @xcite , the famous text in which he he proposes a unification of all geometries based on the idea that geometry should be thought of as a transformation group rather than a space .",
    "although this point of view is familiar to us , and seems natural today , this was not so for mathematicians even by the end of the nineteenth century . without entering into the details of this philosophical question , let us recall that from the times of euclid and until the raise of projective geometry , mathematicians were reluctant to the use of the idea of transformation  which , classically , carried the name _ _ motion _ _  as an element in the proof of a geometrical proposition .",
    "klein s two papers @xcite and @xcite are actually referred to in the _ erlangen program _ text .",
    "we shall quote below some of klein s statements from his _ erlangen program _ that are very similar to statements that are made in the two papers with which we are concerned .",
    "another major element in the erlangen program is the question of finding a _ classification _ of the various existing geometries using the setting of projective geometry and of the projective transformation groups .",
    "paper @xcite constitutes a leading writing on that subject , and it puts at the forefront of geometry both notions of transformation groups and of projective geometry . at the same time , this paper constitutes an important piece of work in the world of non - euclidean geometry , and historically , it is probably the most important one in this domain , after the writings of the three founders of hyperbolic geometry ( lobachevsky , bolyai and gauss ) and after beltrami s paper @xcite on which we shall also comment below .    in the introduction of the first paper @xcite , klein states that among all the works that were done in the preceding fifty years in the field of geometry , the development of projective geometry occupies the first place .",
    "let us note that the use of the notion of _ transformation _ and of _ projective invariant _ by geometers like poncelet had prepared the ground for klein s general idea that a geometry is a transformation group .",
    "the fact that the three constant curvature geometries ( hyperbolic , euclidean and spherical ) can be developed in the realm of projective geometry is expressed by the fact that the transformation groups of these geometries are subgroups of the transformation group of projective transformations .",
    "klein digs further this idea , namely , he gives explicit constructions of distances and of measures for angles in the three geometries using the notion of  projective measure \" which was introduced by cayley about twelve years before him .",
    "in fact , cayley gave a construction of the euclidean plane , equipped with its metric , as a subset of projective space , using projective notions .",
    "this result is rather surprising because _ a priori _ projective geometry is wider than euclidean geometry insofar as the latter considers lines , projections and other notions of euclidean geometry but without any notion of measurement of angles or of distances between points . introducing distances between points or angle measurement and making the transformation group of euclidean geometry",
    "a subgroup of the projective transformation group amounts to considering that space as a particular case of projective geometry ; this was an idea of cayley and , before him , related ideas were emitted by laguerre , chasles and possibly others . however , cayley did not use the notion of cross ratio in his definition of the distance .",
    "klein s definitions of both measures ( distances and angles ) are based on the cross ratio .",
    "it was also klein s contribution that the two non - euclidean geometries are also special cases of a projective geometry .",
    "klein starts his paper @xcite by referring to the work of cayley , from which , he says , ",
    "one may construct a projective measure on ordinary space using a second degree surface as the so - called fundamental surface \" .",
    "this sentence needs a little explanation .  ordinary space \" is three - dimensional projective space .",
    "a  measure \" is a way of measuring distances between points as well as angles between lines ( in dimension two ) or between planes ( in dimension three ) .",
    "such a measure is said to be  projective \" if its definition is based on projective notions and if it is invariant under the projective transformations that preserve a so - called fundamental surface . finally , the  fundamental surface \" is a quadric , that is , a second - degree surface , which is chosen as a  surface at infinity \" in projective space .",
    "to say things briefly , a fixed quadric is chosen . to define the distance between two points ,",
    "consider the line that joins them ; it intersects the quadric in two points ( which may be real  distinct or coincident  or imaginary ) .",
    "the distance between the two points in the space is then , up to a constant factor , the logarithm of the cross ratio of the quadruple formed by these points together with the intersection points of the line with the quadric taken in some natural order . the cross ratio ( or its logarithm )",
    "could be imaginary , and the mutiplicative constant is chosen so that the result is real .",
    "we shall come back to this definition in ",
    "[ s : measures ] of this paper . in any case , the projective measure depends on the choice of a fundamental surface and the definitions of measures on lines or on planes use dual constructions .",
    "thus , klein s construction is based on the fact that two points in the real projective space define a real line , which is also contained in a complex line ( its complexification ) .",
    "if the real line intersects the conic in two points , then these two points are real , and in this case the cross ratio is real . in the general case , the complex line intersects the conic in two points , which may be real or complex conjugate or coincident , and the cross ratio is a complex number .",
    "the multiplicative constant in front of the logarithm in the definition of the distance makes all distances real .    in some cases",
    ", there is a restriction on the conic ; in the case where it is defined by the quadratic form @xmath0 , the conic has an interior and an exterior , and one takes as underlying space the _ interior _ of the conic .",
    "let us recall that in the projective plane , there are only two kinds of non - degenerate conics , viz .",
    "the _ real conics _ , which in homogeneous coordinates can be written as @xmath1 , and the _ imaginary conics _ , which can be written as @xmath2 .",
    "there is also a degenerate case where the conic is reduced to two coincident lines , which can be written in homogeneous coordinates as @xmath3 , or also @xmath4 .",
    "( notice that this is degenerate because the differential of the implicit equation is zero . ) in the way cayley uses it , the degenerate conic can be thought of as the two points on the circle at infinity whose homogeneous coordinates are @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "klein s work is based on cayley s ideas of working with a conic at infinity which he called the  absolute \" and measuring distances using this conic .",
    "cayley gave a general formula that does not distinguish between the cases where the conic is real or imaginary , but he notes that euclidean geometry is obtained in the case where the absolute degenerates into a pair of points .",
    "klein makes a clear distinction between the cases of a real and an imaginary conic and he obtains the three geometries :    * the elliptic , in the case where the absolute is imaginary .",
    "( notice that in this case , all the real directions are points in the projective space , since none of them intersects the imaginary conic . ) the fundamental conic in this case can be taken to be the imaginary circle whose equation is @xmath7 ( it has no real solutions ) . *",
    "the hyperbolic , in the case where the absolute is real . in this case",
    ", the conic has a well - defined  interior \" and an  exterior \" , and the hyperbolic plane corresponds to the interior of the conic . * the parabolic , in the case where the absolute degenerates into two imaginary points .",
    "this is a limiting case of the preceding ones , and it corresponds to euclidean geometry .    in this way , the three geometries become a particular case of projective geometry in the sense that the transformation groups of each geometry is a subgroup of the projective transformation group , namely the group of transformations that fix the given conic .",
    "as we already noted several times , in klein s program , projective geometry acts as a unifying setting for many geometries .",
    "in fact , several theorems in euclidean geometry ( the theorems of pappus , pascal , desargues , menelaus , ceva , etc . )",
    "find their real explanation in the setting of projective geometry .",
    "let us say a few words of introduction to this geometry , since it will the main setting for what follows .    for a beginner ,",
    "projective geometry is , compared to the euclidean , a mysterious geometry .",
    "there are several reasons for that .",
    "first of all , the non - necessity of any notion of distance or of length may be misleading ( what do we measure in this geo - metry ? )",
    "secondly , the euclidean coordinates are replaced by the less intuitive ( although more symmetric )  homogeneous coordinates \" .",
    "thirdly , in this geometry , lines intersect  at infinity \" .",
    "there are points at infinity , there are  imaginary points \" , and there is an overwhelming presence of the cross ratio , which , although a beautiful object , is not easy to handle . we can also add the fact that the projective plane is non - orientable and is therefore more difficult to visualize than the euclidean .",
    "one more difficulty is due to the fact that several among the founders of the subject had their particular point of view , and they had different opinions of what the fundamental notions should be .",
    "using modern notation , the ambient space for this geometry is the @xmath8-dimensional projective space @xmath9 , that is , the quotient of euclidean space @xmath10 by the equivalence relation which identifies a point @xmath11 with any other point @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "the projective transformations of @xmath9 are quotients of linear transformations of @xmath14 .",
    "they map lines , planes , etc . in @xmath14 to lines , planes , etc . in @xmath14",
    "; therefore , they map points , lines , etc . in @xmath9 to points , lines , etc . in @xmath9 .",
    "the incidence properties  intersections of lines , of planes , alignment of points , etc . ",
    "are preserved by the projective transformations .",
    "these transformations form a group called the projective linear group , denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "there is no metric on @xmath9 which is invariant by the action of this group , since this action is transitive on pairs of distinct points .",
    "as we already noted , cayley observed that if we fix an appropriate quadric in @xmath9 , which he called the _ absolute _ , we can recover the group of euclidean geometry by restricting @xmath15 to the group of projective transformations that preserve this quadric . in this way , euclidean space sits as the complement of the quadric , which becomes the _ quadric at infinity_. klein states in his _ erlangen program _",

    "there is a situation which is familiar to any student in geometry , which is in the same spirit as cayley s remark .",
    "if we fix a hyperplane @xmath16 in the projective plane @xmath9 , then the subgroup of the group of projective transformations of @xmath9 that preserve @xmath16 ( that is , that take this hyperplane to itself ) is the affine group .",
    "affine space is the complement of that hyperplane acted upon by the affine group .",
    "it is in this sense that  affine geometry is part of projective geometry \" . in the projective space , at infinity of the affine plane stands a hyperplane . from klein s point of view ,",
    "affine geometry is determined by ( and in fact it is identified with ) the group of affine transformations , and this group is a subgroup of the group of projective transformations .",
    "likewise , euclidean and hyperbolic geometries are all part of affine geometry ( and , by extension , of projective geometry ) , and furthermore , we have models of the spherical , euclidean and hyperbolic spaces that sit in affine space , each of them with its metric and with a  conic at infinity \" .",
    "one consequence is that all the theorems of projective geometry hold in these three classical geometries of constant curvature , and klein insists on this fact , when he declares that projective geometry is  independent of the parallel postulate \" ( see  [ s : second - p ] below ) .    in projective geometry , one studies properties of figures and of maps arising from projections (  shadows \" ) and sections , or , rather , properties that are preserved by such maps .",
    "for instance , in projective geometry , a circle is equivalent to an ellipse ( or to any other conic ) , since these objects can be obtained from each other by projection .",
    "the first mathematical results where projective geometry notions are used , including duality theory , are contained in the works of menelaus , ptolemy and in the later works of their arabic commentators ; see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the renaissance artists also used heavily projective geometry .",
    "a good instance of how projective geometry may be useful in perspective drawing is provided by desargues theorem , which is one of the central theorems of projective geometry and which we recall now .",
    "consider in the projective plane two triangles @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",

    "desargues theorem says that for any two triangles , being in axial perspectivity is equivalent to being in central perspectivity .",

    "elements_. the architect and famous scenographer nicola sabbatini ( 1574 - 1654 ) made extensive use of guidobaldo s theoretical work .",
    "guidobaldo del monte s book is regarded as a mathematical work on a topic in projective geometry .",
    "it is usually considered that the modern theory of projective geometry started with j .- v .",
    "poncelet ( 1788 - 1867 ) , in particular with his two papers , _ essai sur les proprits projectives des sections coniques _",
    "( presented at the french academy of sciences in 1820 ) and _ trait des proprits projectives des figures _ ( 1822 ) .",
    "poncelet tried to eliminate the use of coordinates and to replace them by synthetic reasonings .",
    "he made heavy use of duality ( also called polarity ) theory .",
    "this is based on the simple observation that in the projective plane any two points define a line and any two lines define a point .",
    "using this fact , certain statements in projective geometry remain true if we exchange the words  line \" and  point \" . a well known example is menelaus theorem which transforms under duality into ceva s theorem .",

    "is also attributed the so - called _ principle of continuity _ which roughly says that the projective properties of a figure are preserved when the figure attains a limiting position .",
    "this permits him for instance to assert that points or lines , which disappear at infinity , become imaginary and can therefore be recovered , and one can make appropriate statements about them .    among the other founders of projective geometry , we mention j. brianchon ( 1783 - 1864 ) , a. f. mbius ( 1790 - 1868 ) , m. chasles ( 1793 - 1880 ) , k. g. k. von staudt ( 1798 - 1867 ) and j. steiner ( 1796 - 1863 )",
    ". we shall refer to some of them in the text below .",
    "the gttingen lecture notes of klein @xcite ( 1889 - 90 ) contain notes on the history of projective geometry ( p. 61",
    "we also refer the reader to the survey @xcite by enriques , in which the works of cayley and of klein are also analyzed . a concise modern historical introduction to projective geometry",
    "is contained in gray s _ worlds out of nothing _",
    "@xcite .",
    "perhaps poncelet s major contribution , besides the systematic use of polarity theory , was to build a projective geometry which is free from the analytic setting of his immediate predecessors and of the cross ratio ( which he called the _ anharmonic ratio _ , and so does klein in the papers under consideration ) .",
    "chasles , in his 1837 essay _",
    "aperu historique sur lorigine et le dveloppement des mthodes en gomtrie _ , highlights the role of transformations in geometry , in particular in projective geometry , making a clear distinction between the metric and the projective ( which he called  descriptive \" ) properties of figures .",
    "von staudt insisted on the axiomatic point of view , and he also tried to build projective geometry independently from the notions of length and angle .",
    "one should also mention the work of e. laguerre ( 1843 - 1886 ) , who was a student of chasles and who , before cayley , tried to develop the notions of euclidean angle and distance relatively to a conic in the plane , cf .",
    "@xcite p. 66 .",
    "laguerre gave a formula for angle measure that involves the cross ratio .",
    "it is important nevertheless to note that laguerre , unlike klein , did not consider this as a possible _ definition _ of angle .",
    "laguerre s formula originates in the following problem that he solves : given a system of angles @xmath21 of a certain figure @xmath22 in a plane , satisfying an equation @xmath23 find a relation satisfied by the image angles @xmath24 when the figure @xmath22 is transformed by a projective transformation ( which laguerre calls a homography ) .",
    "the solution that laguerre gives is that @xmath24 satisfy the relation @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the cross ratio of the quadruple of lines made up by two sides of the angles @xmath21 together the lines @xmath27 which are the images of the lines made up by @xmath21 and the two cyclic points of the plane of @xmath22 .",
    "laguerre notes that chasles , in his _ trait de gomtrie suprieure _ @xcite , p. 446",
    ", gave a solution to this problem in the case where the angles @xmath21 share the same vertex or when they are equal .",
    "it seems that neither cayley nor klein , at the beginning of their work on this subject , were aware of laguerre s work .",
    "klein mentioned later on laguerre s work , namely , in his 1889 - 90 lecture notes ( @xcite , p. 47 and 61 ) . in the _ gesammelte mathematische abhandlungen _",
    "( @xcite , vol . 1 , p. 242",
    ") klein declares that at the time he wrote his paper @xcite , he was not aware of laguerre s ideas .",
    "this work of laguerre is also mentioned in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for notes of klein on laguerre s work , and @xcite for some comments on laguerre s formulae .    for klein ,",
    "the subject of projective geometry includes both its synthetic and its analytic aspect . in his historical remarks contained in his lecture notes ( @xcite p. 61 ) , he makes a distinction between the french and the german school of projective geometry and he notes that in the beginning of the 1850s , the french school had a serious advance over the german one , the latter still distinguishing between the projective and the metric properties .",
    "; for it is precisely what provides a sound foundation for that distinction between properties of position and metrical properties , which furnishes a most desirable starting - point for projective geometry . \"",
    "regarding klein s comments on the difference between the french and the german schools , one may remember the context of that time , namely the french - german war ( july 19 , 1870-january 29 , 1871 ) , opposing the french second empire to the prussian kingdom and its allies ; france suffered a crushing defeat and lost the alsace - moselle , which became the german reichsland elsa - lothringen . ]",
    "it is also fair to recall that this nineteenth - century activity on projective geometry was preceded by works of the greeks , in particular by the work of apollonius on the conics ( where the notion of a polar line with respect to a conic appears for the first time ) , by works of pappus , and by the much later works of several french mathematicians , including g. desargues ( 1591 - 1661 ) , who wanted to give a firm mathematical basis to the perspective theory used by painters and architects , and then , b. pascal ( 1623 - 1662 ) , who was influenced by desargues , and g. monge ( 1746 - 1818 ) .",
    "in this section , we recall a few facts on the birth and the reception of non - euclidean geometry , and on its relation with projective geometry .",
    "nikolai ivanovich lobachevsky was the first to publish a treatise on hyperbolic geometry , namely , his _ elements of geometry _ @xcite ( 1829 ) .",
    "the two other founders of the subject are jnos bolyai and carl friedrich gauss . for more than 50 years",
    ", these three works remained unknown to the mathematical community .",
    "lobachevsky s work was acknowledged as being sound only ten years after his death ( 1856 ) , after gauss s correspondence was published .",
    "this geometry first attracted the attention of cayley and then beltrami .",
    "beltrami started by publishing two papers on the subject , _ saggio di interpretazione della geometria non - euclidea _ @xcite ( 1868 ) which concerns the two - dimensional case and _ teoria fondamentale degli spazii di curvatura costante _ @xcite ( 1868 - 69 ) which concerns the three - dimensional case .",
    "we shall elaborate on them below .",
    "lobachevsky , bolyai and gauss developed the hyperbolic geometry system starting from the axiomatic point of view , that is , drawing conclusions from the set of axioms of euclidean geometry with the parallel axiom replaced by its negation .",
    "beltrami , in his paper @xcite , was the first to establish the relation between hyperbolic geometry and negative curvature .",
    "none of the three founders of hyperbolic geometry used the notion of curvature .",
    "it is true that at that time , curvature in the riemannian geometry sense was not yet discovered , but gauss had already introduced the notion of surface curvature and he had showed that it is independent of any embedding in an ambient euclidean space .",
    "gauss nevertheless did not make explicit the relation between curvature and the geometry of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "the definition of spherical geometry as a system which can also be defined using the notion of constant positive curvature is due to riemann .",
    "it is also a geometrical system which is at the same level as euclidean geometry , where the  lines \" are the great circles of the sphere but where there are no disjoint lines .",
    "it is also good to recall that , unlike hyperbolic geometry , the geometrical system of the sphere can not be obtained from the euclidean one by modifying only one axiom , since not only the euclidean parallel axiom is not valid on the sphere , but other axioms as well , e.g. the one saying that lines can be extended indefinitely .",
    "riemann established the bases of spherical geometry in his famous habilitation lecture _ ber die hypothesen , welche der geometrie zu grunde liegen _ ( on the hypotheses which lie at the foundations of geometry ) ( 1854 ) @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that the three geometries  euclidean , hyperbolic and spherical  appear clearly for the same time at the same level , as  the \" three geometries of constant curvature in the paper @xcite of klein .",

    "although the idea for the construction originates in cayley s work ( cayley gave a formula for a distance function without realizing that the resulting metric space is the lobachevsky space ) , and although the construction of such a model for the hyperbolic plane ( but without the distance function ) had been made three years earlier by beltrami in this paper @xcite ( 1868 ) in which he realized that the euclidean segments of the disk are models for the geodesics of hyperbolic space , klein gave the first explicit distance function for hyperbolic geometry .",
    "at the same time , this made the first explicit link between hyperbolic geometry and projective geometry .",
    "4 .   a unified setting for euclidean , hyperbolic and spherical geometries , as these three geometries can be considered as special cases of projective geometry .",

    "assuming in the plane ( or space of geometry of two dimensions ) a conic termed the _ absolute _ , we may by means of this conic , by descriptive constructions , divide any line or range of points whatever , and any point or pencil of lines whatever , into an infinite series of infinitesimal elements , which are ( as a definition of distance ) assumed to be equal ; the number of elements between any two points of the range or two lines of the pencil , measures the distance between the two points or lines ; and by means of the pencil , measures the distance between the two points or lines ; and by means of the quadrant , as a distance which exists as well with respect to lines as points , we are enabled to compare the distance of two lines with that of two points ; and the distance of a point and a line may be represented indifferently as the distance of two points , or as the distance of two lines .",
    "+ in ordinary spherical geometry , the theory undergoes no modification whatever ; the absolute is an actual conic , the intersection of the sphere with the concentric evanescent sphere .",
    "+ in ordinary plane geometry , the absolute degenerates into a pair of points , viz .",
    "the points of intersection of the line at infinity with any evanescent circle , or what is the same thing , the absolute is the two circular points at infinity .",
    "the general theory is consequently modified , viz .",
    "there is not , as regards points , a distance such as the quadrant , and the distance of two lines can not be in any way compared with the distance of two points ; the distance of a point from a line can be only represented as a distance of two points .",
    "+ i remark in conclusion that , _ in my point of view _",
    ", the more systematic course in the present introductory memoir on the geometrical part of the subject of quantics , would have been to ignore altogether the notions of distance and metrical geometry ; for the theory in effect is , that the metrical properties of a figure are not the properties of the figure considered _ per se _ apart from everything else , but its properties when considered in connexion with another figure , viz .",
    "the conic termed the absolute .",
    "the original figure might comprise a conic ; for instance , we might consider the properties of the figure formed by two or more conics , and we are then in the region of pure descriptive geometry by fixing upon a conic of the figure as a standard of reference and calling it the absolute .",
    "metrical geometry is thus a part of descriptive geometry , and descriptive is _ all _ geometry and reciprocally ; and if this can be admitted , there is no ground for the consideration in an introductory memoir , of the special subject of metrical geometry ; but as the notions of distance and of metrical geometry could not , without explanation , be thus ignored , it was necessary to refer to them in order to show that they are thus included in descriptive geometry .",

    "metric \" was somehow vague for cayley and klein .",
    "beltrami s euclidean model for hyperbolic geometry was a major element in the development of that theory .",

    "it was klein who provided this model with an explicit distance function , namely , the distance defined by the logarithm of the cross ratio , and he also noticed that the circle , in beltrami s model , can be replaced by an ellipse .",
    "although this was not his main goal , klein used this model to discuss the issue of the non - contradiction of hyperbolic geometry .",

    "we mention that the non - contradiction issue as well as the relative non - contradiction issue ( meaning that if one geometry is contradictory , then the other would also be so ) among the three geometries was one of the major concerns of lobachevsky , see e.g. his _ pangeometry _ and the comments in the volume @xcite .",
    "it is also important to recall that while beltrami s euclidean model showed that hyperbolic geometry is consistent provided euclidean geometry is , klein s work shows that euclidean , spherical and hyperbolic geometries are consistent provided projective geometry is consistent .",
    "we also mention that in  14 of the paper @xcite , while he computed the curvature of the metric , klein obtained the expression , in polar coordinates , of the so - called poincar metric of the disk .    in his lecture",

    "we now return to klein s papers .",
    "the core of the paper @xcite starts at  3 , where klein describes the construction of one - dimensional projective measures , that is , measures on lines and on circles .",
    "the one - dimensional case is the basic case because higher - dimensional measures are built upon this case .",
    "klein refers to the one - dimensional case as the _",
    "first kind_. there are two sorts of _ measures _ to be constructed : measures on points and measures on angles .",
    "the measure function on points satisfies the usual properties of a distance function except that it can take complex values .",
    "the measure for angles is , as expected , defined only up to the addition of multiples of @xmath42 , and at each point it consists of a measure on the pencil of lines that pass through that point .",
    "it can also take complex values .",
    "klein specifies the following two properties that ought to be satisfied by measures :    1 .",
    "the measures for points satisfy an additivity property for triples of points which are aligned ; 2 .",
    "the two measures ( for points and for lines ) satisfy the property that _ they are not altered by a motion in space_.    property ( a ) says that the projective lines are geodesics for these measures .",
    "a metric that satisfies this property is called ( in modern terms ) _ projective_. the motions that are considered in property ( b ) are the projective transformations that preserve a conic , which is termed the _ basic figure_. klein then addresses the question of the classification of measures , and he notes that this depends on the classification of the transformations of the basic figures , which in turn depends on the number of fixed points of the transformation . since the search for fixed points of such transformations amounts to the search for solutions of a degree - two equation , the transformations that preserve the basic figure fall into two categories :    1 .   those that fix two ( real or imaginary ) points of the basic figure , and this is the generic case .",
    "they are termed measures _ of the first kind_. 2 .   those that fix one point of the basic figure .",
    "they are termed measures _ of the second kind_.    klein describes in detail the construction of measures on lines .",
    "the overall construction amounts to a division of the circle ( seen as the projective line ) into smaller and smaller equal parts , using a projective transformation .",
    "thus , if we set the total length of the circle to be 1 , the first step will provide two points at mutual distance @xmath43 , the second step will provide three points at mutual distance @xmath44 , and so forth . passing to the limit",
    ", we get a measure on the circle which is invariant by the action of the given projective transformation .",
    "more precisely , klein starts with a transformation of the projective line of the form @xmath45 , with @xmath46 real and positive .",
    "the transformation has two fixed points , called _ fundamental elements _ , the points @xmath47 and @xmath48 . applying the transformation to a point @xmath49 on the line , we obtain the sequence of points @xmath50 . in order to define the measure",
    ", klein divides , for any integer @xmath8 , the line into @xmath8 equal parts using the transformation @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath8th root determination is chosen in such a way that @xmath52 lies between @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the distance between two successive points is then defined as the @xmath55th of the total length of the line .",
    "iterating this construction , for any two integers @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the distance between @xmath49 and a point of the form @xmath58 is set to be the exponent @xmath59 , that is , the logarithm of the quotient @xmath60 divided by @xmath61 . by continuity",
    ", we can then define the distance between two arbitrary points @xmath53 and @xmath49 to be the logarithm of the quotient @xmath62 divided by the constant @xmath61 .",
    "the constant @xmath63 is denoted henceforth by @xmath64 .",
    "klein shows that the measure that is defined in this way is additive , that the distance from a point to itself is zero , and that the distance between two points is invariant by any linear transformation that fixes the fundamental elements @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "he then observes that the quotient @xmath67 may be interpreted as the cross ratio of the quadruple @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the distance between two points @xmath69 is a constant multiple of the logarithm of the cross - ratio of the quadruple @xmath68 .",
    "in particular , the distance between the two fundamental elements is infinite .    in",
    " 4 of his paper , klein extends the distance function @xmath70 to pairs of points on the complex line joining the points @xmath47 and @xmath48 , after choosing a determination of the complex logarithm .",
    "he then gives an expression for a general result where he assumes , instead of the special case where the two fundamental elements are @xmath47 and @xmath48 , that these points are the solutions of a second - degree equation @xmath71 for two arbitrary points given in homogeneous coordinates , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , setting @xmath74 @xmath75 and @xmath76 the distance between the two points is @xmath77    later on in klein s paper , the same formula , with the appropriate definition for the variables , defines a measure between angles between lines in a plane and between planes in three - space .    in  5",
    ", klein derives further properties of the construction of the measure , distinguishing the cases where the two fundamental points are respectively real distinct , or conjugate imaginary , or coincident .",
    "the first case was already treated ; the two fundamental points are infinite distance apart , and they are both considered at infinity .",
    "he observes that this occurs in hyperbolic geometry , a geometry where any line has two points at infinity .    the case where the two fundamental points are conjugate imaginary occurs in elliptic geometry where a line has no point at infinity .",
    "klein shows that in this case all the lines are finite and have a common length , whose value depends on the constant @xmath64 that we started with .",
    "the distance [ eq : omega0 ] between two points becomes @xmath78 klein notes that a particular case of this formula appears in cayley s paper , who used only the value @xmath79 for @xmath64 and when , consequently , the term in front of @xmath80 is equal to 1 .",
    "klein studies the case where the two fundamental points coincide in  6 .",
    "this case concerns euclidean ( parabolic ) geometry .",
    "it is more complicated to handle than the other cases and it needs a special treatment .",
    "one complication arises from the fact that in this case equation ( [ eq : omega ] ) , which has a unique solution , leads to distance zero between the points @xmath11 and @xmath81 .",
    "the problem is resolved by considering this case as a limit of the case where the equation has two distinct solutions .",
    "klein derives from there the formula for the distance on a line in which there is a unique point at infinity , that is , a unique point which is infinitely far from all the others .    in  7",
    ", klein introduces a notion of _ tangency of measures at an element_. for this , he introduces two measures associated to a basic figure of the first kind , which he calls  general \" and  special \" , and which he terms as  tangential \" . the overall construction amounts to the definition of infinitesimal geometric data , and it is also used to define a notion of a _ curvature of a general measure_. the sign and the value of this curvature depend on some notion of deviation , which he calls  staying behind or running ahead \" of the general measure relative to the special measure .",
    "he shows that the value of this geometrically defined curvature is constant at every point , and equal to @xmath82 , where @xmath64 is the characteristic constant of the general measure .",
    "using taylor expansions , klein shows that the three geometries ( elliptic , parabolic and hyperbolic ) are tangentially related to each other , which is a way of saying that infinitesimally , hyperbolic and spherical geometry are euclidean .",
    "the value of @xmath64 is either real or imaginary so that one can get positive or negative curvature .",
    "has sometimes to be taken imaginary .",
    "this is to be compared with the fact that some ( real ) trigonometric functions can be expressed as functions with imaginary arguments . ]    in  8 , klein outlines the construction of the measure for basic figures of the second kind , that is , measures on planes and measures on pencils of dihedral angles between planes .",
    "he uses for this an auxiliary conic .",
    "this is the so - called _ fundamental conic _ ( the conic that is called the _ absolute _ by cayley ) .",
    "each projective line intersects this conic in two points ( real , imaginary or coincident ) .",
    "the two points play the role of fundamental points for the determination of the metric on that line , and the problem of finding a measure is reduced to the 1-dimensional case which was treated before .",
    "the fundamental conic is the locus of points which are infinitely distant from all others .",
    "measures on rays in the plane are based on the fact that at each point , there are rays that start at that point and that are are tangent to the conic .",
    "again , these rays are solutions of a certain quadratic equation and they may be distinct real , distinct imaginary or coincident .",
    "the two tangent rays are taken to be the fundamental rays for the angle determination in the sense that the angle between two arbitrary rays is then taken to be the cross ratio of the quadruple formed by these rays and the fundamental rays .",
    "the multiplicative constant is not necessarily the same in the formulae giving the measures on lines and on rays .",
    "klein then determines an analytic expressions for these measures .",
    "it turns out that the formulae are the same as those obtained in  4 .",
    "if the equation of the fundamental conic is @xmath83 then the distance between the two points @xmath11 and @xmath81 , in homogeneous coordinates @xmath84 and @xmath85 , is @xmath86 where @xmath87 , etc .",
    "are the expressions obtained by substituting in @xmath88 the coordinates @xmath89 of a point @xmath11 or @xmath90 of a point @xmath81 , etc .",
    "equivalently , we have @xmath91 that is , one obtains again formulae ( [ eq : omega0 ] ) and ( [ eq : omega ] ) of  4 .",
    "concerning measures on angles , the equations have a similar form .",
    "one takes the equation of the fundamental conic in line coordinates to be @xmath92 the distance between the two points @xmath93 and @xmath94 in homogeneous coordinates @xmath95 and",
    "@xmath96 is then @xmath97 or , equivalently , @xmath98 where @xmath99 have the same meaning as before .",
    "the constant @xmath100 is in general different from @xmath64 .",
    "in general , the constants are chosen so that the result is real .",
    "the measures on points and on lines are defined by similar formulae .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that they are solutions of second - degree equations , and that the coefficients of the two equations are related to each other by the duality in projective geometry .",
    "duality is discussed in the next section .",
    " 9 concerns the properties of the projective transformations of the plane that preserve a conic .",
    "klein points out that there is a  threefold infinity \" of such transformations ( in other words , they form a 3-dimensional group ) , and he starts a classification of such transformations , based on the fact that each transformation fixes two points of the conic and reasoning on the line connecting them , on the tangents at these points , on their point of intersection , and working in the coordinates associated to the triangle formed by the connecting line and the two tangents .",
    "the classification involves the distinction between real conics with real points and real conics without real points .",
    "the aim of the analysis is to prove that the transformations that map the conic into itself preserve the metric relations between points and between angles .",
    "there is also a polar duality determined by the conic . with this duality , a quadruple formed by two points and the intersection of the line that joins them with the conic corresponds to a quadruple formed by two lines and tangents to the conic that pass through the same point .",
    "this correspondence preserves cross ratios .",
    "the duality is such that the distance between two points is equal to the angle between the dual lines .",
    "this is a generalization of the polar duality that occurs in spherical geometry .",
    "after the discussion of projective measures between points in  9 , klein considers in  10 measures for angles in pencils of lines and of planes . in this setting , he uses a _",
    "fundamental cone of second degree _ instead of the fundamental conic .",
    "he also appeals to polarity theory and he makes a relation with the measure obtained in the previous section .",
    "the result brought out at the end of the previous section is interpreted here as saying that the angle between two planes is the same as the angle between their normals , and this has again an interpretation in terms of spherical geometry duality .    in  11 ,",
    "klein develops a model for spherical geometry that arises from his measures associated to conics .",
    "when the fundamental conic is imaginary , setting @xmath101 and @xmath102 , the measures for lines and for angles are found to be respectively @xmath103 and @xmath104 which are the familiar formulae for angle measure on a sphere . in particular , the distance between any two points is bounded , as expected . in fact , all lines are closed , they have finite length , and these lengths have a common value , @xmath105 , which is ( up to a constant multiple ) the angle sum of a pencil , which is @xmath106 .",

    "the equation of the hyperbola is @xmath121 .",
    "the minor axis is also called the imaginary axis because of the minus sign occurring in this equation .",
    "the degeneration of the hyperbola into two imaginary points is obtained by keeping fixed the imaginary axis and shrinking to zero the major axis . meanwhile , the two branches of the hyperbola collapse to the line carried by the minor axis , covering it twice .",
    "this line represents a degenerate conic , and in fact , as klein points out , insofar as it is enveloped by lines , it is represented by the two conjugate imaginary points .",
    "the associated measure on the plane is called a _ special measure _ , because it uses a pair of points instead of a fundamental conic .",
    "klein obtains an analytic formula that gives the associated distance between points . starting with the general expression @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the equation of the conic and @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 are as he defined in  4 , and taking limits",
    "when the conic degenerates to a pair of points , he deduces that the distance between two points @xmath127 and @xmath128 is @xmath129 which up to a constant factor is the euclidean distance in coordinates .",

    "klein insisted on this fact , because , as he wrote , some mathematicians thought that there was a vicious circle in his construction of euclidean geometry from projective geometry , considering that the definition of the cross ratio uses euclidean geometry , since it involves a compounded ratio between four euclidean segments .",
    "some also thought that there was a contradiction in klein s reasoning , since in spherical and hyperbolic geometry euclid s parallel axiom is not satisfied , so a formula for the metric defining these geometries can not be based on the distance function of euclidean geometry where the parallel axiom is satisfied . in fact , as was already recalled above , in his _ geometrie der lage _ @xcite , von staudt had already worked out a purely projective notion of the cross ratio , independent of any notion of distance . in his _ lectures on the development of mathematics in the xixth century _",

    ".   there was a great deal of confusion about klein s ideas , even among the most brilliant mathematicians .",
    "the mathematicians were not only interested in formulae , but they were digging in the profound meaning that these formulae express .",
    "we end this paper with a brief summary of the content of @xcite , since no available translation exists .",
    "the reader can compare the content of this paper with the summary of the _ erlangen program _ lecture given in chapter 1 of this volume @xcite .",
    "the introduction contains historical recollections on the works of cayley and von staudt which , according to klein , did not have yet any applications .",
    "klein then recalls that the  problem of parallels \" , that is , the problem of deciding whether euclid s parallel axiom follows or not from the other axioms of euclidean geometry was settled .",
    "he mentions the works of the founders of modern geometry , and he says that each of them brought new mathematical concepts , in particular , new examples of spaces of constant curvature . at the same time , several open questions remain to be solved , and other things need to be made more precise .",
    "klein then mentions the spaces of variable curvature constructed by riemann .",
    "all these works contribute to new points of view on spaces and on mechanics .",
    "he also recalls that there is a difference between the metrical and the projective points of view , and he declares that the geometries of constant curvature should be simpler to study .    in section 1 of the first part of the paper , klein considers the concept of higher dimensions .",
    "he mentions the relation between constant curvature manifolds and projective manifolds .",
    "analytic geometry allows the passage to higher dimensions , working in analogy with the low dimensions that we can visualize .",
    "he points out that on a given line , we can consider either the real points or all points .",
    "he then recalls the definition of the cross ratio .",
    "section 2 concerns transformations .",
    "klein explains the notion of composition of transformations , and he considers in particular the case of collineations , forming a group .",
    "he then presents the idea of group isomorphism .",
    "the reader should recall that these ideas were relatively new at that time .",
    "section 3 concerns  invariant \" , or ",
    "geometric \" , properties .",
    "a property is geometric if it is independent of the location in space",
    ". a figure should be indistinguishable from its symmetric images .",
    "the properties that we seek are those that remain invariant by the transformations of the geometry .    in section 4",
    ", klein develops the idea that the methods of a given geometry are characterized by the corresponding groups .",
    "this is again one of the major ideas that he had expressed in his _",
    "erlangen program_. he elaborates on the significance of projective geometry , and in particular on the transformations that leave invariant the imaginary circle at infinity .",
    "the methods depend on the chosen transformation group .    the discussion on sections 3 and",
    "is also confirmed by klein in klein s lecture notes of 1898/90 ( @xcite , p. 120 ; goenner s translation ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ in contradistinction [ to helmholtz ] , i had the generic thought that , in studying manifolds under the viewpoint of giving them a _ geometric _ character , one can put ahead any transformation group [ .. ] . *",

    "modern algebra is helpful in that study . in the case where we have a metric",

    "he raises the question of understanding the transformations of a manifold of constant curvature in the projective world , and this is done in linearizing them .",
    "indeed , by choosing adequate coordinates , the group of transformations that we attach to a manifold of constant curvature is contained in the group of linear transformations .",
    "( _  the transformation group of a constant curvature geometry is reducible to a transformation group which preserves a quadratic form \" .",
    "_ ) klein says however that there is a difference between his viewpoint and the one of beltrami , namely , klein starts with complex variables and then he restricts to real variables .",

    "section 7 concerns the cross ratio and homogeneous coordinates .    in section 8",
    ", klein gives an analytical proof of the main theorem of projective geometry .",
    "he says that there is a characterization of 2-dimensional projective geometry .    to conclude this section ,",
    "let us insist on the fact that beyond their immediate goal ( which is an important one ) , the two papers by klein are full of interesting historical comments and references to works of other mathematicians .",
    "they are the expression of the elegant style and the great erudition which characterizes klein s writings in general",
    ". the reader should remember that in 1871 , at the time he wrote the paper @xcite , klein was only 22 years old .",
    "in his paper @xcite ( 1887 ) , poincar describes a construction of a set of geometries , using quadrics in three - space .",
    "the theory of associating a geometry to a quadric is of course related to the theory developed by klein , although the point of view is different .",
    "whereas in klein s ( and cayley s ) construction , the quadric is at infinity , the geometry , in the case developed by poincar , _ lives _ on the quadric .    let us recall that a _ quadric _ , also called ( by poincar ) a _ quadratic surface _ , (  surface quadratique \" ) is a surface in euclidean three - space which is the zero locus of a degree - two polynomial equation in three variables .",
    "there is a projective characterization of quadrics , which is coordinate - free : a quadric is a surface in projective space whose plane sections are all conics ( real or imaginary ) .",
    "it follows from this definition that the intersection of any line with a quadric consists of two points , which may be real or imaginary , unless the line belongs to the quadric .",
    "furthermore , the set of all tangents to te quadrics from an arbitray point in space is a cone which cuts every plane in a conic , and the set of contact points of this cone with the quadric is also a conic .",
    "there are well - known classification of quadrics ; some of them use coordinates and others are coordinate - free .",
    "chapter 1 of the beautiful book of hilbert and cohn - vossen , _ geometry and the imagination _",
    "@xcite , concerns quadrics .",
    "the equation of a conic can be put into normal form .",
    "like for conics ( which are the one - dimensional analogues of quadrics ) , there are some nondegenerate cases , and some degenerate cases .",
    "poincar obtained the two non - euclidean geometries as geometries living on non - degenerate quadrics , and euclidean geometry as a geometry living on a degenerate one .",
    "this is very close to the ideas of klein .",
    "there are nine types of quadrics .",
    "six of them are _ ruled surfaces _",
    "( each point is on at least one straight line contained in the surface ) ; these are the cone , the one - sheeted hyperboloid , the hyperbolic paraboloid and the three kind of cylinders ( the elliptic , parabolic and hyperbolic ) .",
    "the three non - ruled quadrics are the ellipsoid , the elliptic paraboloid and the two - sheeted hyperboloid .",
    "these three surfaces do not contain any line .          given a quadric , the locus of midpoints of the system of chords that have a fixed direction is a plane , called a _",
    "diametral plane _ of the quadric . in the case where the quadric has a center ,",
    "a diametral plane is a plane passing through the center .    like in the case of the sphere , with its great circles and its small circles , poincar calls a _ line _ an intersection of a quadric surface with a diametral plane , and a _ circle _ an intersection of a quadric with an arbitrary plane",
    ".    angles are then defined using the cross ratio . given two lines @xmath135 and @xmath136 passing through a point @xmath137 , poincar considers the quadruple of euclidean lines formed by the tangents to @xmath135 and @xmath136 and the two rectilinear generatrices of the surface that pass through the point @xmath137 .",
    "there are two generatrices at every point of the surface , and they may be real or imaginary .",
    "poincar defines the _ angle _ between @xmath135 and @xmath136 as the logarithm of the cross ratio of the four euclidean lines ( @xmath135 , @xmath136 and the two generatrices ) in the case where the two generatrices are real ( and this occurs of the surface is a one - sheeted hyperboloid ) , and this logarithm divided by @xmath138 in the case where the generatrices are imaginary .",
    "now given an arc of a line of the quadric , consider the cross ratio of the quadruple formed by the two extremities of this arc and the two points at infinity of the conic .",
    "the _ length _ of this arc is the logarithm of the cross ratio of this quadruple of points in the case where the conic is a hyperbola , and the logarithm of this cross ratio divided by @xmath138 otherwise .",
    "poincar then says that there are relations between lengths and distances defined in this way , and that such relations constitute a set of theorems which are analogous to those of plane geometry .",
    "he calls the collection of theorems associated to a given quadric a _",
    "there are as many quadratic geometries as there are kinds of second degree surfaces , and poincar goes on with a classification of such geometries .",
    "there are other geometries , e.g. the one - sheeted hyperboloid and its various degenerate cases .",
    "some of the degenerate geometries give the euclidean geometry .",
    "but the one - sheeted hyperbolid itself gives a geometry which poincar highlights , as being a geometry which was not been studied yet , and in which the following three phenomena occur :      \\2 ) there are two sorts of lines , those of the first kind , which correspond to the elliptic diametral sections , and those of the second kind , which correspond to the hyperbolic diametral sections .",
    "it is not possible , by a real motion , to bing a line of the first kind onto a line of the second kind .",
    "poincar , in this paper , does not mention klein , but he thoroughly mentions lie , and he considers this work as a consequence of lie s work on groups . in the second part of the paper , titled  applications of group theory \" , poincar gives a characterization of the transformation group of each of these geometries .",
    "this is done in coordinates , at the infinitesimal level , in the tradition of lie .",
    "he considers ( p. 215 ) that  geometry is nothing else than the study of a group \" .",
    "our aim in this paper was to present to the reader of this book an important piece of work of felix klein .",
    "we also tried to convey the idea that mathematical ideas occur at several people at the same period , when time is ready for that .",
    "each of us has a special way of thinking , and it often happens that works on the same problem , if they are not collective , complement themselves .",
    "we also hope that this paper will motivate the reader to go into the original sources .      1 .",
    "we already noted that klein , in his development of the three geometries in his papers @xcite and @xcite , considers euclidean geometry as a _ transitional _ geometry . in this way",
    ", euclidean geometry corresponds to a limiting case of the absolute , in which the fundamental conic degenerates into a pair of imaginary points .",
    "we developed the notion of transitional geometry in the paper @xcite , in a way different from klein s , and we studied in which manner the fundamental notions of geometry ( points , lines , distances , angles , etc . ) as well as the trigonometric formulae transit from one geometry to another .",
    "an interesting problem is to make the same detailed study of transition of these fundamental notions in the context of klein s description of the geometries .",
    "hilbert developed a generalization of the klein model of hyperbolic geometry where the underlying set is the interior of an ellipsoid to a geometry ( called hilbert geometry ) where the underlying set is an arbitrary open convex set in @xmath140 .",
    "the distance between two points @xmath11 and @xmath81 in hilbert s generalization is again the logarithm of the cross ratio of the quadruple consisting of @xmath11 and @xmath81 and the two intersection points of the euclidean line that joins these points with the boundary of the ellipsoid , taken in the natural order .",
    "we propose , as a problem , to develop generalizations of the two other geometries defined in the way klein did it , that are analogous in some way to the generalization of hyperbolic geometry by hilbert geometry .",
