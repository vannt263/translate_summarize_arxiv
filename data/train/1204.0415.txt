    "the performance of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern has been extraordinary in the last year and data of about 5 fb@xmath0 has been already collected by each of the two major experimental groups cms and atlas . with",
    "the data already accumulated , the lhc has left the lep and tevatron results far behind in many of the search channels .",
    "but , apart from the recent hint @xcite about a possible 124  126 gev higgs boson , no other signal of any new physics ( np ) has been reported yet .",
    "the minimally supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) which is undoubtedly one of the most studied models beyond the standard model ( sm ) has been a benchmark for the lhc searches and limits on supersymmetric particles have been shown by both the atlas and cms collaborations @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite which is a beautiful theoretical idea by its own right has been in the spotlight among the phenomenologists for a long time because of its ability to tame the quadratic divergence in the scalar sector of the sm elegantly . however if susy has to be realized in nature , it must be broken so that it does not contradict experimental observations . from a theoretical point of view , one would expect that the susy is broken spontaneously so that the underlying microscopic lagrangian is susy invariant but the vacuum state is not .",
    "this is the same mechanism which keeps the electroweak symmetry hidden at low energies .",
    "there is no consensus about how susy must be broken at high energies but by whichever way it is broken , at the electroweak scale the effect of susy breaking can always be parameterized by introducing additional terms in the lagrangian which break susy explicitly . but these terms should only include operators which do not bring back the quadratic divergences from the quantum corrections to the scalar masses .",
    "these are called the susy breaking soft terms , all of which have positive mass dimension .",
    "unfortunately , spontaneous breaking of susy in a phenomenologically acceptable way has not been achieved till now with only tree level renormalizable interactions .",
    "this problem has been solved by breaking susy in a sector , the so called `` hidden sector '' , which has either no coupling or very small direct coupling to the mssm fields . however , there are some mediating interactions which carry the information of susy breaking from the hidden sector to the mssm and generate the soft terms .",
    "the gravitational interaction as a mediator of susy breaking has been the most popular scenario historically @xcite .",
    "another very popular mechanism has been the so called  gauge mediated susy breaking ( gmsb )  @xcite scenario where the soft terms are generated through loops involving some messenger fields .",
    "these messenger fields couples to the susy breaking sector and also have sm gauge group quantum numbers . as",
    "gauge interactions are flavor diagonal , this mechanism also has the advantage of automatically being flavor - blind which is phenomenologically attractive from the points of view of flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) .    the general gauge mediation ( ggm ) , a framework developed by meade , seiberg , and shih @xcite generalizes models of gauge mediation to accommodate arbitrary hidden sectors including those which are not necessarily weakly coupled .",
    "it was shown in ggm that the soft masses of mssm gauginos and sfermions , to leading order in the sm gauge interactions , can be expressed in terms of the hidden sector current correlation functions .",
    "extension of this framework has been studied in @xcite .",
    "it was also shown in a model independent way that non - universal gaugino masses can be obtained in ggm without spoiling the gauge - coupling unification . by universality in gaugino masses",
    "we mean that these masses at any scale are proportional to the corresponding gauge couplings at that scale .",
    "however , in weakly coupled gmsb scenarios with complete multiplets of su(5 ) messengers the gaugino masses remain universal . in general messenger models",
    "@xcite , one can achieve non - universal gaugino masses but the masses of the messenger fields get constrained in order to maintain gauge coupling unification .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that one can achieve unification of gauge couplings even if the new fields added at some intermediate scales do not form complete multiplets of su(5 ) and the unification is independent of the scale at which these fields are added .",
    "these specially chosen fields were termed as `` magic '' fields and they were used in ordinary gauge mediation in order to get non universal gaugino masses with extremely large hierarchy , 1:30:200 among the u(1 ) , su(2 ) and su(3 ) gaugino mass parameters @xcite , which is phenomenologically not interesting . also the obtained patterns of mass ratios were not very flexible .    in this paper",
    "we generalize their idea and write the superpotential containing all possible renormalizable terms for the messenger sector .",
    "we derive the soft susy breaking terms and show that the gaugino sector can be described by two independent parameters which can be tuned to achieve almost any ratio of gaugino masses .",
    "this is a novel feature of our models .",
    "we also show that the sfermion sector in this class of models can also be parameterized by two parameters which can be chosen to adjust the relative masses of squarks and sfermions . in this class of models",
    "the squark masses can be equal to the higgs mass parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 at the messenger scale which can lead to a small value of the higgsino mass parameter @xmath3 and thus , a higgsino - like nlsp ( like models of extra ordinary gauge mediation ( eogm ) with doublet triplet splitting @xcite ) .",
    "some region of the parameter space of this model also allows for the lightest susy higgs mass about 125 gev .",
    "we consider a phenomenologically interesting scenario where the ratio of the u(1 ) and su(2 ) gaugino mass parameters at the electroweak scale is comparatively larger than the universal case 1:2 . in this case , because of the comparatively larger splitting between the next - to - lightest neutralino lightest ( @xmath4 ) and the neutralino ( @xmath5 ) , the higgs boson ( @xmath6 ) coming from the decay @xmath7 is quite boosted .",
    "motivated by this , we study the @xmath8 + @xmath9 + @xmath10  channel to look for susy higgs boson using the jet substructure technique .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly review the concept of magic fields .",
    "in sec.[s : soft.terms.magic ] , we describe our models and then study the mass spectrum of gauginos and sfermions .",
    "the phenomenology of an explicit model of this class of models is discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : pheno ] .",
    "we close our discussion in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] with a brief summary of our findings .",
    "in this section we will review the concept of magic fields and derive some relations which will be useful later in this paper .",
    "it is well known that , if no additional matter field is added in the intermediate scale , the sm gauge couplings get unified in the mssm at the scale @xmath11 gev . in general , assuming that the gauge couplings unify at some scale @xmath12 , their one loop renormalization group ( rg ) equations reads , @xmath13 where the index @xmath14 represent the sm gauge groups @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively and @xmath18 are the corresponding beta functions . in the mssm we have",
    "@xmath19 = @xmath20 = \\{@xmath21}.    at any value of @xmath3 , is an equation of a straight line in @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it directly follows that for the unification of the gauge couplings , @xmath24 and @xmath25 must respect the following relation , @xmath26 even if matter fields are added at some intermediate scale , the gauge coupling unification can be maintained ( at one loop ) so far as is satisfied . the fields",
    "whose beta functions are such that they do not spoil are called magic fields .    using the one - loop rg equation of in the mssm",
    "one has , @xmath27 we now add matter fields at some intermediate scales and assume that fields added at the scale @xmath28 contribute to the beta functions by an amount @xmath29 ( dynkin index of that field ) .",
    "the gauge couplings at any scale @xmath3 can now be written as , @xmath30    if we now choose @xmath31 then it is clear that will remain intact .",
    "hence we can achieve gauge coupling unification even with the presence of intermediate mass scales and this is independent of the values of @xmath28 .",
    "but unlike complete multiplets of say , su(5 ) the unification scale changes in this case @xcite .",
    "let us assume that the gauge coupling constants now unify at a scale @xmath32 .",
    "we can now rewrite as , @xmath33 comparing we can now write the new unification scale @xmath12 in terms of the unification scale @xmath34 in the mssm , @xmath35 the change in the unified value of the gauge couplings , @xmath36 can also also be written down explicitly , @xmath37    an example of magic fields is the combination of fields @xmath38 and @xmath39 whose transformation properties under the sm gauge group are given by @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively . here",
    "the first number in the bracket is the su(3 ) representation and the second number refers to the su(2 ) representation .",
    "the number outside the bracket is the hypercharge of the multiplet .",
    "note that the individual fields above are not magic fields but the combination as a whole satisfies the magic field condition of .",
    "the set of fields mentioned above can be obtained from the so(10 ) complete multiplets @xmath43 and @xmath44 after spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will derive some general properties of the magic messenger models where , unlike models of ordinary gauge mediation , the superpotential also contains bare mass terms allowed by symmetry .",
    "but before we go to the details of our model , let us first discuss those models of gmsb where non - universal gaugino masses have been obtained and their qualitative differences with our model .    in ordinary gauge mediation models",
    "the messenger fields are complete multiples of su(5 ) like @xmath45 .",
    "addition of such complete multiplets changes the beta functions equally for all the sm gauge groups at any scale .",
    "clearly this does not change the universality of the gaugino masses .",
    "even if all possible renormalizable terms are considered in the superpotential , the situation does not change and universality is maintained .",
    "but instead of su(5 ) multiplets if one uses su(2 ) and su(3 ) irreducible representations and write the most general superpotential ( like models of eogm with doublet triplet splitting @xcite ) , then non - universal gaugino masses can be achieved only if these doublets and triplets are charged differently under some global symmetry . but to achieve gauge coupling unification at the same time the masses of the messenger fields should satisfy some constraints . in generalized messenger models , one can easily obtain non - universal gaugino masses but this type of models generally bypass the question of unification by arguing that there may be some other fields ( not messenger of susy breaking ) in the theory which are charged under the sm and using these fields it is always possible to get successful unification .",
    "if one does not assume this then messenger masses get constrained again .",
    "another generalized messenger model is also available in the literature @xcite where messenger masses are not constrained but the gut used there is an anomalous u(1 ) gut .",
    "the models we are proposing are also generalized messenger models but here the messenger fields are magic fields .",
    "this class of models has two main differences with other generalized messenger models : ( a ) gauge coupling unification is independent of messenger scales and ( b ) changes in beta functions for each added messenger satisfy the magic relation of .",
    "the second property has non - trivial consequences as we will see in the next two sections .",
    "our models consists of ( 1 ) @xmath46 pairs of magic messenger fields , each pair consisting of ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) where @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) transforms under some representation ( its conjugate representation ) of the sm gauge group , and ( 2 ) a spurion field @xmath49 which is a standard model gauge singlet but can have charges under some other symmetries like the r - symmetry . note that these @xmath47 fields are in general not single irreducible representations ; they can be a set of fields ( each transforming under an irreducible representation ) which satify the magic condition of .",
    "we assume that the field @xmath49 gets a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) through some dynamics of the hidden sector : @xmath50 .",
    "for the sake of calculational simplicity we make the assumption that two different pairs of magic messengers either transform under the same representation of the gauge group or have no constituent fields having the same transformation property .",
    "this allows us to sub - divide the messenger field pairs into different sets ( labeled by @xmath51 ) where all members of a set have the same representation .",
    "note that a set may consist of either one pair of messenger fields or many pairs of them .",
    "we label the different members ( a particular pair of magic messengers ) of a set @xmath51 by the index @xmath52 .",
    "for example , if a particular set @xmath51 has five pairs of magic messengers then @xmath52 runs from 1 to 5 .",
    "we now write the renormalizable superpotential to be , @xmath53 where the form of the matrices @xmath54 and @xmath55 are determined by global ( r and/or non - r ) symmetries of the theory .",
    "note that , in general different constituent fields of any magic field can get different masses and couplings . but",
    "to form a magic field , these constituent fields need to share the same mass .",
    "we treat the magic fields ( @xmath56 s ) ` as if they are irreducible representations of some group ' and write the couplings in the superpotential because this assumption automatically ensures the above requirement ( of equality of the masses of the constituent fields of each the magic messenger fields ) .",
    "the above superpotential is symmetric under the interchange of @xmath56 field with @xmath57 and vice versa .",
    "this symmetry is called the messenger parity and it helps us to get rid of the dangerous fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) terms .. under messenger parity @xmath58 , because the fields @xmath57 transform under the conjugate representation of the fields @xmath56 . hence ,",
    "due to messenger parity , vev of @xmath59 vanishes @xcite .",
    "] throughout this paper we will call this class of models as `` magic messengers in gauge mediation ( mmgm ) '' .    to calculate the soft - terms",
    ", we need to write the lagrangian in mass eigenstates of fermion fields and scalar fields . using bi - unitary transformations on the superfields ,",
    "we first make fermion mass matrices of each set diagonal and real : @xmath60 . in this basis",
    "the khler term will not change .",
    "the matrices @xmath61 will change but for brevity we keep the same symbols .",
    "messenger parity and cp conservation imply that these matrices should be real and symmetric .",
    "going to the basis @xmath62 , we can bring sfermion mass squared matrix of any set in the block - diagonal form with two blocks : @xmath63 .",
    "now these two matrices can be diagonalized as @xmath64 with eigenvalues @xmath65 .",
    "we define the following combinations of @xmath66 matrices which will be used in the next section , @xmath67      the expression for gaugino masses at the messenger scale can be written as , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the dynkin index of the magic messenger pairs in the set labeled by @xmath51 corresponding to the gauge group label @xmath70 , the superscript @xmath71 in @xmath72 refers to the gaugino sector , and @xmath73 is given by @xcite @xmath74 here @xmath75 are independent of the sm gauge group .",
    "however the presence of @xmath76 in the expression for gaugino masses implies that the ratio of gaugino masses is not equal to the ratio of @xmath77 s .",
    "this means that the gaugino masses are non - universal in this class of models .",
    "apparently it seems that the gaugino masses are completely independent , but actually this is not true .",
    "their ratio satisfies some beautiful structure .",
    "the ratio of the gaugino masses can be written as , @xmath78 : \\frac{\\alpha_3}{\\alpha_1 } \\left[1 + \\left(b_0^{(3)}-b_0^{(1 ) } \\right ) \\zeta \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 the value of @xmath80 can be zero , positive or negative .",
    "all the gaugino mass parameters become equal if @xmath81 where in the last step we used .",
    "any arbitrary @xmath80 can always be written as @xmath82 in that case takes the form , @xmath83    it is now clear from that various ratios among the gaugino masses can be obtained , ( a ) for negative @xmath84 , one gets normal hierarchy , ( b ) for @xmath85 , all the gaugino masses are equal , and , ( c ) for non - zero positive @xmath86 , one gets inverted hierarchy . for @xmath87 , some more patterns can be achieved .",
    "so to conclude this section , the gaugino sector of this class of models can be parametrized by two free parameters : one of them can be taken as the mass of the u(1 ) gaugino and the other one is the @xmath80 ( or @xmath84 ) parameter .",
    "these two parameters can be tuned to get phenomenologically interesting ratios among the gaugino masses .",
    "the sfermion masses are obtained at the two loop level in gmsb . in ggm , these are parameterized by three parameters @xmath88 ( a = 1 , 2 , 3 ) for three gauge groups",
    "u(1 ) , su(2 ) and su(3 ) . in terms of these three parameters",
    "the expression for the sfermion masses @xcite can be written as follows , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the quadratic casimir of the representation @xmath91 of the gauge group @xmath70 . in our class of models",
    "the expression for @xmath88 turns out to be @xmath92 where @xmath93 is given by @xcite , @xmath94.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quantities @xmath95 and @xmath88 are required to be strictly positive in order to have positive sfermion masses .",
    "ratio of the @xmath88 parameters can be written as , @xmath96 where @xmath97 note that @xmath98 can not be greater than @xmath99 .",
    "for @xmath100 , one has @xmath101 . in this limit , from one can see that soft susy breaking squark and higgs masses will be approximately same ( universal ) at the messenger scale .",
    "this would in turn render the value of @xmath1 at weak scale insensitive to the universal scalar masses in the ultraviolet .",
    "this can be understood as a consequence of a  focus point  in the rg behavior of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in this case it is possible to have a small @xmath3 ( supersymmetric mass term for the higgs ) @xcite and thus , a higgsino like nlsp .",
    "this can lead to very distinct phenomenology @xcite .",
    "in this section we construct an explicit model of mmgm . we take two sets of messengers , the first set constists of two pairs of su(5 ) @xmath102 fields : @xmath103 with @xmath104 , and the second set contains a magic field : @xmath105 .",
    "note that one can write down the required terms for gauge mediation ( as given in ) using only @xmath106 and without invoking its conjugate field @xmath107 . moreover ,",
    "absence of the field @xmath107 does not break the messenger parity because the superpotial remains invariant under the interchange of @xmath108 by @xmath109 and vice versa .",

    "in order to increase this ratio , @xmath23 should be made large compared to @xmath70 and @xmath115 .",

    "so gaugino masses are highly hierarchical ( see table ii ) but @xmath88 parameters are not . to understand this",

    "( b.6 ) and ( b.8 ) of @xcite , one can see that the off - diagonal element @xmath23 has no effect on the expression for gaugino masses whereas it has dominant contribution on the sfermion masses .",
    "using the fact that @xmath130 , the expression for the @xmath98 parameter can be approximated as : @xmath131 .",

    "the one - loop renormalization group equations for the three gaugino mass parameters in the mssm are determined by the same quantities @xmath136 ( a=1 , 2 , 3 ) which also control the rg running of the three gauge couplings .",

    "for all the signal points we use the nlo cross - section from prospino@xcite .",
    "we simulate the t@xmath191 , wh , wz and zh backgrounds using pythia@xcite . for the wbb , zbb and single top backgrounds we generate the unweighted event files in alpgen @xcite and then use the alpgen - pythia interface ( including matching of the matrix element hard partons and shower generated jets , following the mlm prescription@xcite ) to perform the showering and implement our event selection cuts . for the t@xmath191 background a k factor of 2 has been used .",
    "we use the cteq6l parton distribution functions and set top mass at 172.9 gev in our analysis .",
    "we have also used the new lhc pythia 6.4 tune z2 * for the correct description of the underlying events@xcite .",
    "we see that a @xmath214 about 4 - 6 can be obtained at 8tev lhc with an integrated luminosity of about 30 fb@xmath0 . at the 14tev lhc",
    "the siuation is much better and even with 15 fb@xmath0 we get fairly good number of events , while the backgrounds are totally under control with our selection cuts . in table-[table2 ] ( table-[tablenew ] ) we have simulated at least 30 fb@xmath0 ( 15 fb@xmath0 ) of events for both the signal points as well as the backgrounds .",
    "note that detector and other experimental effects will degrade the signal significance somewhat .",
    "we have checked that the numbers change by @xmath14310% if a gaussian smearing is added to the transverse momenta of the jets and the missing transverse momentum , though a faithful quantification of the detector effects is beyond the scope of this work .    as the masses of @xmath141 and @xmath140 increase ( see table.[table1 ] ) , their production cross - section gradually decreases .",
    "this tends to reduce the signal to background ratio .",
    "but on the other hand from the benchmark-1 to benchmark-6 the mass difference between @xmath140 and @xmath139 also increases .",

    "these two opposite effects keep competing with each other .",
    "this is why the signal efficiency initially increases with increasing @xmath140 mass but again starts falling down because of the rapid decrease in the crosssection .",
    "in this paper we have implemented magic fields as messengers of susy breaking in gmsb .",
    "one of the advantages of using magic fields as messengers over other generalized messengers is that achievement of unification is independent of the masses of the magic messengers .    in our model",
    "the gaugino sector is parameterized by only two independent parameters , one of them can be taken to be the u(1 ) gaugino mass and the second one being the @xmath84 parameter ( ) .",
    "the @xmath80 parameter can be tuned to get various hierarchies among the gaugino masses which can lead to distinct phenomenological consequences .",
    "the sfermion sector can also be characterized by only two independent quantities .",
    "these are the u(1 ) a - parameter @xmath121 ( eq . [ a - parameter ] ) and the parameter @xmath98 ( eq . [ eta ] ) .",
    "choosing @xmath98 , different hierarchies between the squark and slepton masses can be achieved . when the value of @xmath98 is close to its upper limit @xmath215 , the squark and higgs masses at the messenger scale tend to be almost same .",
    "this allows one to have small @xmath3 parameter and higgsino - like nlsp similar to the models of eogm with large doublet - triple splitting .",
    "we focus on the region of parameter space where a comparatively larger splitting ( about 1:6 ) between the u(1 ) and su(2 ) gaugino masses is achieved along with the lightest supersymmetric higgs boson mass about 125 gev .",
    "we consider the direct electroweak production of @xmath216 and @xmath150 with @xmath216 decaying to the lightest neutralino @xmath149 and a @xmath217 boson , and @xmath150 decaying to @xmath149 and the lightest higgs @xmath6 . because of the large splitting between @xmath150 and @xmath149 ,",
    "the produced higgs boson is expected to have quite large transverse momentum .",
    "motivated by this we have analyzed the @xmath8 + @xmath23@xmath218 + @xmath219   channel using the jet substructure technique .",
    "we have simulated all possible backgrounds for this final state and conclude that while @xmath214 @xmath143 4  6 is viable ( for the mass ranges of charginos and neutralinos we have considered ) at 8 tev lhc with a integrated luminosity of 30 fb@xmath0 , lhc14 can do much better and even with 15 fb@xmath0 of data a decent number of signal events over the backgrounds is expected . in our analysis , we have not considered any detector effect which is expected to degrade the signal significance to some extent .",
    "a detailed exploration of other phenomenological consequences of this class of models including constraints from flavor physics as well as other low energy experiments should be carried out and we plan to perform such a study in a future publication @xcite .",
