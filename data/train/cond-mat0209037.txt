    "for periodic systems such as the square , the triangular or the hexagonal lattice embedded in a magnetic field , it is well - known that commensurability effects between the characteristic magnetic length and the lattice period may lead to very interesting features .",
    "for example , if we consider a standard tight - binding model , the energy spectrum displays a complex multifractal structure when varying the magnetic flux per unit cell as illustrated by the famous hofstadter butterfly @xcite .",
    "however , this spectrum is strongly geometry - dependent since even for periodic tilings , some anomalies can appear leading to interesting quantum interference phenomena @xcite .",
    "this dependence has led several groups to analyze the interplay between the quasiperiodicity and the magnetic frustration @xcite . nevertheless , in these studies , it is difficult to know the real contribution of the quasiperiodic order since the incommensurability between the tiles area is another source of aperiodicity in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "we must indeed distinguish several classes of tilings depending on their structural order ( periodic , quasiperiodic or disordered ) , their topology ( trivial or nontrivial ) and the ratio of the tiles area ( rational or irrational ) .",
    "if we focus on quasiperiodically ordered structures , there is actually one type of tiling ( those of codimension one ) that has never been studied so far which consists in a nontrivial topology ( several types of coordination numbers ) with commensurate tile areas .",
    "the aim of this work is to study such tilings by considering a modified version of the two - dimensional generalized rauzy tilings ( grt ) presented in ref .",
    "@xcite that are built with tiles having the same areas .",
    "note that a great advantage of such systems is that all the physical quantities are periodic functions of the magnetic field so that we can restrict our analysis to a finite range of flux values .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we briefly present the two - dimensional isometric generalized rauzy tilings ( igrt ) whose properties will always be compared to the square lattice ones . in sect .",
    "[ butterflies ] , we introduce the tight - binding hamiltonian and we compute the energy spectrum of both tilings . we show that despite the quasiperiodic order , the spectrum of the igrt has a fine nontrivial structure . to get more precise informations on the spectrum and the eigenstates , we compute in sect .",
    "[ dynamics ] the time evolution of wave packets for different fluxes per plaquette @xmath0 and we focus on the average autocorrelation function and the mean square spreading . for the igrt",
    "a singular continuous spectrum and a sub - ballistic propagation is found for rational and irrational @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the flux quantum .",
    "by contrast , for the square lattice , the propagation is ballistic and the spectrum absolutely continuous for rational @xmath3 , whereas the spectrum is singular continuous and the spreading sub - ballistic for irrational @xmath3 .",
    "[ superconducting ] is devoted to the superconducting wire network with the igrt geometry . after mapping the linearized ginzburg - landau equations onto a tight - binding model with nonconstant hopping terms ,",
    "we compute the transition temperature as a function of the magnetic field and compare it with those of the square lattice .",
    "a cusp - like structure is clearly observed and shows the importance of the quasiperiodic order in this context .",
    "the grts are codimension one quasiperiodic structures that can easily be built in any dimension @xmath4 using the standard cut and project method @xcite .",
    "these tilings have a complex topological structure with sites of coordination number ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6 . in this study , we focus on the two - dimensional grt whose contruction is based on the irrational solution @xmath7 of the equation : @xmath8 contrary to previous studies @xcite concerning these tilings , we consider here an isometric version of the @xmath9 grt where all the edge lengths are equal .",
    "this can be very easily done by projecting the selected sites of the @xmath10 cubic lattice perpendicularly to the direction @xmath11 instead of the rauzy direction @xmath12 .",
    "such a choice is motivated by the fact that since these tilings are codimension one tilings , equal edge lengths imply equal tile areas .",
    "this property which is only true for codimension one tilings allows us to concentrate on the role played by the topological quasiperiodicity related to the connectivity matrix .",
    "isometric generalized rauzy tiling .",
    "all the tiles have the same area .",
    ", width=226 ]",
    "in this study , we consider a standard tight - binding hamiltonian given by : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a localized orbital on site @xmath15 .",
    "the hopping term @xmath16 if @xmath15 and @xmath17 are nearest neighbors and @xmath18 otherwise . in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite , @xmath19 is multiplied by a phase factor @xmath20 involving the vector potential @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the flux quantum . in the following ,",
    "we only consider the case of a uniform magnetic field @xmath24 which can be obtained , for example , with the landau gauge @xmath25 , and we denote by the magnetic flux through an elementary tile .",
    "it is also useful to introduce the dimensionless parameter @xmath26 known as the reduced flux .",
    "the study of the zero - field spectrum of @xmath27 has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for the nonisometric grts , but for @xmath28 the tile areas is an irrelevant parameter since @xmath27 is , in this case , simply proportionnal to the connectivity matrix . the spectral measure is absolutely continuous , the spectrum is gapless , and the weakly critical eigenstates , are responsible for an anomalous diffusion . to obtain the spectrum of @xmath27 for @xmath29 , we have used the recursion method @xcite also known as lanczos algorithm @xcite .",
    "this powerful tool allows one to compute the local density of states ( ldos ) of a given initial state .",
    "the main advantage of this method is that we can easily compute this ldos for very large system size ( about @xmath30 sites ) , by diagonalizing only a small half - chain of a few hundred sites .",
    "however , it does just give a local information but , if one considers an initial random phase state , its ldos gives a fairly good approximation of the total density of states . to compute these spectra",
    "we have computed 500 recursion coefficients in a circular cluster of 785757 sites for the square lattice , and 460 coefficients in a circular cluster of 767604 sites for the igrt .",
    "we must also mention an important point concerning the edge states .",
    "indeed , since we compute the recursion coefficients up to a given order , there are obviously some spurious states that arise due to the fact that the recursion cluster is finite with open boundary conditions .",
    "to get rid of them , we have selected eigenvectors for which the amplitude on the initial state of the recursion was greater than a given threshold ( here @xmath31 ) .    as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ butterflies : fig ] , the spectrum of the square lattice obtained here with the recursion scheme is in very good agreement with those computed by hofstadter in 1976 using the mappping onto the harper equation @xcite . as it can be readily seen , both spectra display the symmetry @xmath32 related to the fact that both tilings are bipartite .",
    "in addition , since there is only one characteristic area , the hamiltonian is a periodic function of @xmath3 with period 1 .",
    "finally , the symmetry with respect to @xmath33 just reflects the symmetry @xmath34 . at small fields , the emergence of landau levels , expected in the continuum limit , is clearly observed . in the square lattice , it is well known that rational values of @xmath35 lead to an absolutely continuous spectrum made up of @xmath36 subbands that can touch each other as for @xmath33 . of course , nothing similar",
    "is expected for quasiperiodic tilings since no periodicity exists.nevertheless , it is interesting to note that for the igrt , there is still a complex gap structure with notably a large gap that can be followed continuously from @xmath37 ( where it vanishes ) till @xmath33 .",
    "we can also see that the igrt spectrum display a fine subband structure that would require a detailed but difficult analyzis since even in the zero field case , it is nontrivial .         for the square lattice ( top ) and for the igrt ( bottom ) . for convenience",
    ", we have only considered rational values of @xmath35 for @xmath38.,width=355 ]    to go beyond this basic description , we have analyzed the nature of the spectrum for particular values of the reduced flux by studying the quantum dynamics of wave packets in both structures for remarkable values of the reduced flux .",
    "the quantum dynamics in two - dimensional quasiperiodic tilings has been widely investigated within the last ten years either by exact diagonalizations @xcite or by approximating the evolution operator @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "here we have used the second order differencing scheme @xcite , that consists , for a given initial state @xmath40 , to make the following approximation : @xmath41 contrary to exact diagonalizations , this method allows one to investigate the dynamics on very large systems ( about one million sites ) . practically , choosing a time step @xmath42 is sufficient to get a good accuracy and all our results",
    "have been obtained with this value .",
    "we have considered two quantities of interest : the averaged autocorrelation function @xmath43 where @xmath44 and the mean square spreading @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the position operator , the origin being taken at the center of the cluster .",
    "the spectral and diffusion exponents @xmath47 and @xmath48 are defined from the long time behavior of @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively .",
    "if @xmath51 , the spectrum is absolutely continuous , if @xmath52 , the spectrum is pure point , and if @xmath53 the spectrum is singular continuous . concerning the diffusion exponent , @xmath54 corresponds to a ballistic propagation whereas @xmath55 defines a sub - ballistic regime ( @xmath56 is the diffusive case ) .    for the square lattice ,",
    "since all sites are equivalent , we have considered an initial state localized on a single ( central ) site . for the igrt ,",
    "the situation is more complicated since , as for the octagonal tiling @xcite , the exponents depends , a priori on the initial conditions as shown in ref .",
    "of course , this is only true at short times , since in the asymptotic regime , we expect @xmath57 , @xmath58 for @xmath59 in the spectrum . here , we have built an initial random phase state localized on a circular cluster ( @xmath60 sites ) whose radius is about 1/100 of the cluster considered for the computation , and we have checked that our results were weakly sensitive to the precise random phase configuration chosen .",
    "however , we can never ensure that we have reached the asymptotic regime so that the exponents given here just give a qualitative idea of the wave packet spreadings .",
    "we have considered several special values of the reduced flux : ( i ) @xmath37 for which the band width are maximum for both lattices  ; ( ii ) @xmath33 for which the band width of the igrt is minimum  ; ( iii ) @xmath61 for which the band width of the square lattice is minimum  ; ( iv ) @xmath62 which is a natural irrational number in this context .",
    "our results are plotted in fig.[exposants : fig1 ] and fig.[exposants : fig2 ] .    for the square lattice , everything is qualitatively known for these values .",
    "indeed , when @xmath3 is a rational number , the eigenstates are bloch waves , the spectrum is absolutely continuous ( @xmath51 ) and the spreading is ballistic ( @xmath54 ) . for @xmath37 , when starting from a single site , one can even easily show that : @xmath63 which behaves as @xmath64 at large time denotes the bessel function of order @xmath18 .",
    "] so that @xmath65 and @xmath66 . for irrational @xmath3 ,",
    "the spectrum is known to be singular continuous @xcite , and the propagation sub - ballistic @xcite .",
    "nevertherless , we emphasize that existing results about the dynamics have been obtained by analyzing the harper chain and do not reflect the dynamics on the square lattice . indeed ,",
    "the mapping of the square lattice onto the harper chain results from a decoupling of the eigenstates given by @xmath67 which is due the special landau gauge choice .",
    "thus , the dynamics discussed in refs . @xcite only concerns the @xmath68 direction ( at fixed @xmath69 ) and thus do not give the exponent of the two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "for example , we have computed the dynamics for @xmath70 and we have found @xmath71 in the square lattice instead of @xmath72 in the harper chain @xcite .",
    "( from bottom to top ) .",
    "bottom : igrt for @xmath73 ( from bottom to top).,width=355 ]    interestingly , for @xmath61 , we have found a diffusive propagation with @xmath74 whereas for @xmath62 , the problem is more complicated since there are clearly two regimes . if we consider only @xmath75 we obtain , ( weakly sub - ballistic motion ) but we can not decide whether it is an intermediate regime or not .",
    "the exponents obtained by fitting our data are given in .",
    "for the igrt , the situation is different since even for @xmath37 , the spectrum has some critical states responsible for a sub - ballistic spreading @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the diffusion exponent is strongly energy - dependent and might even be very close to 1 at the band edges . in the asymtotic regime , a quasi - ballistic propagation should therefore be recovered .",
    "contrary to the square lattice , a sub - ballistic spreading is found for @xmath33 with @xmath76 which is not really surprising since even though @xmath77 is a rational number , the underlying quasiperiodicity of the igrt does not allow for the contruction extended eigenstates . in a sense , there are no commensurability effects for rational @xmath3 .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for @xmath61 , it is interesting to note that the propagation is faster in the igrt ( @xmath78 ) than in the square lattice @xmath74 .",
    "this means that the quasiperiodic order can break the destructive quantum interference effects that slow the spreading down for incommensurate @xmath3 in periodic structures .",
    "nevertheless , this is not always the case , since for @xmath62 , the propagation is faster in the square lattice than in the igrt .",
    "concerning the nature of the spectrum , it is always found to be clearly singular continuous but for @xmath37 , we can not be sure that @xmath79 in the asymptotic regime .",
    "in this section , we analyze the role of the quasiperiodic order on the superconducting - normal transition temperature as a function of the magnetic field @xmath80 . as explained above",
    ", the main advantage of the igrt is that all its elementary tiles have the same area .",
    "thus , we can really analyze the role of the topological quasiperiodic order which has , in fact , never been investigated .",
    "the study of quasiperiodic wire networks has been initially motivated by several experiments @xcite in which the superconducting transition temperature as a function of the magnetic field was determined .",
    "using a mapping between the linearized ginzburg - landau equations and the tight - binding model , the rich structure of this phase boundaries has been then computed by nori and coworkers @xcite .",
    "the main idea of this correspondence developped by alexander @xcite and de gennes @xcite is to integrate the lgl equations on each wire and to obtain a set of equations that determines the order parameter @xmath81 at each nodes @xmath15 .",
    "this can be simply achieved using the continuity of the order parameter and the current conservation at each node . denoting by @xmath82 the distance between the ( connected ) nodes @xmath15 and @xmath17 and by @xmath83 the coherence length , the current conservation at each node @xmath15 expresses as : @xmath84 where the elementary flux quantum involved on the definition ( [ defgamma ] ) of @xmath85 is here @xmath86 .",
    "the coherence length depends on the temperature : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the transition temperature at zero field . for a given value of the magnetic field",
    ", the transition temperature is thus given by the highest temperature for which a nontrivial solution of ( [ lgl ] ) exists .",

    "( [ lgl ] ) can be rewritten as @xcite : @xmath92 setting with @xmath93 and @xmath94 , we obtain the secular system given by the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) and thus the field dependence of the transition temperature : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the highest eigenvalue of this modified hamiltonian for a reduced flux @xmath97 .    for the square lattice ,",
    "the first experiments have been performed by pannetier _",
    "_ @xcite and have confirmed the validity of these predictions .",
    "indeed , a self - similar cusp - like structure for rational @xmath3 has been clearly identified in agreement with the fractal pattern of @xmath96 already pointed by hofstadter @xcite . for quasiperiodic systems , experiments by behrooz and coworkers @xcite have also revealed an cusp - like structure that can be understood in terms of incommensurability between the tiles area @xcite .         for the square lattice ( grey curve ) and for the igrt ( black curve ) .",

    "@xcite , this is a particularly well - adapted algorithm to obtain the ground state of the modified hamiltonian which is in this case equal to @xmath98 .",
    "the results displayed in fig . [ tc ] , clearly show the strong cusp - like structure for the square lattice but nothing similar seems to occur for igrt .",
    "however , when zooming , we can distinguish a fine structure in @xmath80 but with oscillations much smaller than those of the square lattice .",
    "we also note that , for the igrt , the minimum of @xmath80 is obtained for @xmath33 where an inverse - cusp is observed as for the dice lattice @xcite or for the kagome lattice @xcite .",
    "this rich cusp structure is rather strange for this tiling since there is no incommensurability effect due to either the ratio of the tile areas ( which are all equal for the igrt ) or to the lattice periodicity .",
