    "in plasma discharges , surfaces of objects immersed in the plasma may emit electrons .",
    "this emission may be caused by direct heating of the material ( thermal cathodes ) , intense light ( photoemission ) , or by bombardment by energetic electrons or ions ( secondary electron emission ) .",
    "if the electrostatic potential of the object is much lower than the potential of the plasma , the emitted electrons are accelerated by the electric field and form an electron beam in the plasma .",
    "if the two - stream instability develops , the intense plasma oscillations will heat the plasma and modify the electron velocity distribution function ( evdf ) .",
    "this includes , in particular , production of suprathermal electrons which are very important in material processing .",
    "@xcite    the presence of the electron beam itself does not guarantee that the intense oscillations will appear . if the dissipation , _",
    "e.g. _ due to collisions between electrons and neutrals , is strong , the instability may not develop at all . in an experiment of sato and",
    "heider,@xcite a 1000 ev electron beam was creating a plasma in a chamber filled with neutral gas ( hydrogen or helium ) .",
    "various values of neutral pressure were used . an energy analyzer",
    "placed at the exit end was measuring the energy spectrum of the beam particles .",
    "for neutral pressures below 70 mtorr , it was found that the higher the beam current the greater the width of the spectrum .",
    "similar effect was caused by the increase of the neutral density since this was accompanied with the plasma density increase and the corresponding increase of the instability growth rate .",
    "the growth of the energy spectrum width was attributed to the nonlinear interactions between the beam and the plasma . however , when the neutral pressure exceeded 70 mtorr , the spectrum broadening disappeared which was interpreted as suppression of the instability by the collisions .    the effect of collisions of plasma electrons on the two - stream instability has been studied previously in infinite or semi - infinite plasmas .",
    "singhaus@xcite considered a relativistic electron beam with a gaussian velocity distribution in a relatively cold plasma .",
    "the system was infinite and initially uniform .",
    "only collisions for plasma electrons were accounted for .",
    "electron beams with different temperatures were used .",
    "the beam was considered hot or cold depending on the value of parameter @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the beam and the plasma electron densities , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the average energy and temperature of the beam . for the cold beam @xmath5 and low collision frequency @xmath6 , the growth rate is @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the langmuir frequencies of the plasma and the beam electrons . for the large collision frequency @xmath10 ,",
    "the growth rate of the cold beam instability is @xmath11 growth rate ( [ eq : s2 ] ) is essentially an ordinary collisionless growth rate of the two - stream instability in an infinite plasma",
    ". growth rate ( [ eq : s3 ] ) remains nonzero for any value of @xmath12 and therefore the collisions can not stabilize the cold beam .",
    "the reason for this is the strong resonance between the cold beam and the plasma wave in the infinite plasma . in warm beams , however , this resonance is weaker and the collisions may prevent the instability . according to singhaus,@xcite for high - temperature beams @xmath13",
    "this occurs if the collision frequency satisfies condition @xmath14 these conclusions , with minor corrections , were later confirmed by self , shoucri , and crawford .",
    "@xcite in particular , they provide the following convenient expression for the growth rate of the instability of a hot maxwellian beam consistent with the criterion ( [ eq : s1 ] ) : @xmath15    abe et al .  @xcite used a one - dimensional particle - in - cell ( pic ) code to study injection of a beam into a long ( 15 to 17 resonance beam wavelengths @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the beam velocity and @xmath18 is the electron plasma frequency ) plasma - filled region approximating a semi - infinite plasma .",
    "they focused on spatial rather than temporal growth and found that while the linear spatial growth rate ( observed in the region few @xmath19 wide near the emission boundary ) was barely affected by collisions , the amplitude of oscillations in the area where the particle dynamics is nonlinear ( downstream of the first wave amplitude maximum ) was reduced compared to the collisionless case .",
    "it is necessary to mention that the collisions considered were due to electrostatic forces existing in the numerical model . in general , the frequency of such collisions is a function of the grid size , time step , and the number of particles.@xcite    andriyash , bychenkov , and rozmus@xcite considered analytically and numerically the two - stream instability which appears when an ultra - short linearly - polarized x - ray laser pulse produces streams of photoionized electrons in a gas target .",
    "they shown that for higher collision frequencies , the saturation of the instability occurs faster and at lower levels .",
    "cottrill et al.@xcite considered relativistic electron beams with different temperatures and distribution functions propagating in a dense plasma where electron - ion colisions for the bulk electrons are important .",
    "this problem is relevant to the fast ignition scheme in fusion applications where the plasma is heated by a relativistic beam created by a short high - intensity laser pulse .",
    "numerical solution of the dispersion equation showed that the two - stream instability growth rate is reduced due to collisions for the cold beam .",
    "for a high - temperature beam the collisions can cancel the two - stream instability .",
    "similar results were obtained by hao et al .",
    "@xcite who also solved a kinetic dispersion relation for a relativistic electron beam propagating in a cold dense plasma with coulomb collisions .",
    "lesur and idomura@xcite studied the bump - on - tail instability in an infinite 1d plasma using a vlasov code with the collisional operator containing drag and diffusion .",
    "they showed that the collisions strongly affect nonlinear stochastic dynamics of plasma oscillations in such a system .",
    "unlike papers mentioned above , the present paper considers a low pressure beam - plasma system of the length of only few beam resonance wavelengths .",
    "previously , a short beam - plasma system was considered by pierce.@xcite in pierce diode , however , the beam electron density is equal to the density of background ions , while in the present paper there is also the electron background while the beam density is small compared to the density of ambient electrons . for theoretical analysis ,",
    "the electron beam is considered as monoenergetic .",
    "this is justified if the beam energy is much higher than both the plasma and the beam temperature .",
    "the beam temperature may increase as the beam propagates through the plasma due to scattering on neutrals and due to interaction with strong plasma wave if the two - stream instability is excited .",
    "however , the size of the system considered is small compared to the mean free path of beam electrons associated with electron - neutral collisions .",
    "beam electrons perturbed by the wave also quickly leave the system and perturbations of the beam velocity remain small compared to the initial velocity for a large part of the linear growth stage . whether the two - stream instability develops or not depends on the competition between the two time scales  the growth rate of the instability without collisions and the collision frequency .",
    "the growth rate of the instability in such a short plasma is much lower than that in an infinite plasma.@xcite therefore , the suppression of the instability occurs for a lower neutral gas pressures than in an infinite plasma for the same beam and plasma density and the beam energy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:02 ] , the linear theory of the two - stream instability in a bounded plasma with collisions",
    "is given . in section  [ sec:03 ]",

    "a beam of electrons is emitted by the wall @xmath20 with velocity @xmath22 and absorbed by the wall @xmath21 .",
    "the walls reflect plasma electrons .",
    "this boundary condition approximates a sheath appearing in a real plasma at the plasma - wall interface .",
    "the beam motion is collisionless while the plasma electrons are scattered , for example by neutrals , with the collision frequency @xmath23 .",
    "the ion motion is omitted .",
    "the ion density @xmath24 is uniform , constant , and it ensures that the plasma is initially neutral @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the initial densities of the bulk and beam electrons .",
    "full dynamics of such a system is described by the following set of equations : @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 where subscripts _ e _ and _ b _ denote bulk and beam electrons , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the electron charge and mass , the electric field is @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the electrostatic potential .    note that in the beam motion equation ( [ eq:03 ] ) the collisional term is omitted .",
    "this is reasonable if ( a ) for the given beam energy and neutral density the electron mean free path is much larger than the size of the system @xmath36 , and ( b ) the energy of the beam is high ( typically hundreds of ev ) so that the scattering occurs at small angles  @xcite and the velocity of the scattered beam electron is close to its initial velocity .",
    "collisions for the plasma electrons are retained , however , since these electrons are trapped by the sheath inside the plasma volume and they suffer collisions even though they have to bounce several times between the walls before that .",
    "these conditions are satisfied in kinetic simulations described in section  [ sec:04 ] .",
    "the linear dispersion equation is obtained in a procedure similar to the one used by pierce  @xcite and recently in ref .  .",

    "therefore , @xmath68 itself is a universal parameter depending on the normalized system length ( [ eq : aft17 ] ) only .",
    "the difference , however , is in the definition ( [ eq:18 ] ) of variable @xmath68 as a function of @xmath65 which in the present paper involves the collision frequency .",
