    "the quest for a complete understanding of phases of matter has been a driving force in condensed matter physics . from the landau - ginzburg - wilson paradigm @xcite to topological insulators and superconductors @xcite to topological orders @xcite to symmetry protected topological ( spt ) phases @xcite to symmetry enriched topological phases @xcite , we have witnessed an infusion of ideas from topology into this century - old field .",
    "spt phases are a relatively simple class of non - symmetry - breaking , gapped quantum phases and have been a subject of intense investigation in recent years @xcite . as an interacting generalization of topological insulators and superconductors and intimate partner of topological orders @xcite",
    ", they exhibit such exotic properties as the existence of gapless edge modes , and harbor broad applications .",
    "they have also been increasingly integrated into other novel concepts such as many - body localization and floquet phases @xcite .    despite tremendous progress @xcite ,",
    "a complete classification of spt phases remains elusive .",
    "this is especially true when fermions , high ( e.g.@xmath0 ) spatial dimensions , or continuous symmetry groups are involved .",
    "a number of proposals have been made for the general classification of spt phases : the borel group cohomology proposal @xcite , the oriented cobordism proposal @xcite , freed s proposal @xcite , and kitaev s proposal @xcite in the bosonic case ; and the group supercohomology proposal @xcite , the spin cobordism proposal @xcite , freed s proposal @xcite , and kitaev s proposal @xcite in the fermionic case .",
    "these proposals give differing predictions in certain dimensions for certain symmetry groups , and while more careful analysis @xcite has uncovered previously overlooked phases and brought us closer than ever to our destination , we believe that we can do much more .    in this paper , we will take a novel , minimalist approach to the classification problem of spt phases , by appealing to the following principle of mark twain s @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ distance lends enchantment to the view . _",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    in this spirit , we will not commit ourselves to any particular construction of spt phases , specialize to specific dimensions or symmetry groups , or investigate the completeness of any of the proposals above . instead",
    ", we will put various proposals under one umbrella and present results that are independent of which proposal is correct .",
    "this will begin with the formulation of a hypothesis , we dub the generalized cohomology hypothesis , that encapsulates essential attributes of spt classification .",
    "these attributes will be shown to be possessed by various existing proposals and argued , on physical grounds , to be possessed by the unknown complete classification should it differ from existing ones .",
    "the results we present will be rigorously derived from this hypothesis alone .",
    "because we are taking a  meta \" approach , we will not be able to produce the exact classification in a given dimension protected by a given symmetry group .",
    "we will be able , however , to _ relate _ classifications in different dimensions and/or protected by different symmetry groups .",
    "such relations will be interpreted physically  this may require additional physical input , which we will keep to a minimum and state explicitly .",
    "a major advantage of this formalism is the universality of our results , which , as we said , are not specific to any particular construction .",
    "what will enable us to relate different dimensions and symmetry groups is ultimately the fact that the hypothesis is a statement about all dimensions and all symmetry groups simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , due to a certain  symmetry \" the hypothesis carries , the relations we derive will hold in arbitrarily high dimensions .",
    "finally , the hypothesis is supposed to apply to fermionic phases as well as bosonic phases .",
    "thus our formalism is not only independent of construction , but also independent of physical dimension and particle content , that is , bosons vs.fermions .",
    "more specifically , the hypothesis will be based on a prototype offered by kitaev @xcite .",
    "we will add a couple of new ingredients ( additivity and functoriality ; see below ) and formulate the ideas in a language amenable to rigorous treatment . while the hypothesis is informed by refs.@xcite , our philosophy is fundamentally different .",
    "the goal of refs.@xcite was to classify spt phases in @xmath1 dimensions by incorporating into the hypothesis current understanding of the classification of invertible topological orders .",
    "the goal of this paper is to make rigorous , maximally general statements about the classification of spt phases by refraining from incorporating such additional data .",
    "the approach of refs.@xcite was concrete , whereas ours is minimalist .",
    "here is a preview of some of the fruits of this minimalist undertaking .",
    "a.   we will be able to relate the original definition of spt phases @xcite to the one currently being developed by refs.@xcite , which is in terms of invertibility of phases and uniqueness of ground state on arbitrary spatial slices . according to the latter definition ,",
    "the classification of spt phases can be nontrivial even without symmetry .",
    "( for instance , the integer quantum hall state represents an spt phase in that sense . )",
    "we will show that spt phases in the old sense are not only a subset , but in fact a direct summand for groups , but the direct sum notation @xmath2 is more common for abelian groups in the mathematical literature .",
    "] , of spt phases in the new sense .",
    "more precisely , @xmath3 where invertible topological orders are synonymous with spt phases ( in the new sense ) without symmetry , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are arbitrary .",
    "we will also see the two definitions are nicely captured by two natural variants of a mathematical structure that we will introduce .",
    "these claims depend only on the hypothesis , and are expounded upon in sec.[subsec : unification_old_new_definitions_spt_phases ] .",
    "b.   we will be able to relate the classification of translationally invariant spt phases to the classification of usual spt phases .",
    "( from now on , spt phases will mean spt phases in the new sense . )",
    "the former are protected by a discrete spatial translational symmetry @xmath6 as well as an internal symmetry @xmath5 , whereas the latter are protected by @xmath5 alone .",
    "it is conceivable that translational symmetry will refine the classification , but it is not clear whether every usual spt phase will have a translationally invariant representative , whether every usual spt phase will split into multiple phases , or whether all usual spt phases will split into the same number of phases . to all three questions , we will give affirmative answers .",
    "more precisely , we will prove that there is a decomposition @xmath7 such that forgetting the translational symmetry corresponds to projecting from the left - hand side onto the second direct summand in the right - hand side .",
    "these claims depend only on the hypothesis and the belief that it applies to translational symmetries as well as internal symmetries for a suitable definition of translationally invariant spt phases .",
    "these are the subject of sec.[subsec : strong_weak_topological_indices_interacting_world ] .",
    "c.   we will go on to argue , through a field - theoretic construction in app.[app : field_theoretic_argument_weak_index_interpretation ] , that the inclusion of the first summand in the right - hand side into the left - hand side corresponds to a layering construction , where one produces a @xmath4-dimensional translationally invariant phase by stacking identical copies of a usual @xmath8-dimensional phase .",
    "d.   we will generalize the relation above to @xmath4-dimensional spt phases protected by discrete translation in @xmath9 directions .",
    "we will see a hierarchy of lower - dimensional classifications enter the decomposition , with @xmath10 direct summands in dimension @xmath11 .",
    "( the relation above corresponds to @xmath12 . )",
    "this is discussed in sec.[hierarchy_strong_weak_topological_indices ] .",
    "e.   we will reinterpret the @xmath6 above as discrete temporal translational symmetry . accordingly , there will be a decomposition @xmath13 we will give physical meaning to the projection maps onto the two direct summands in the right - hand side , in terms of pumping and floquet eigenstates , respectively .",
    "what the relation tells us is that a @xmath4-dimensional floquet spt phase can pump any @xmath8-dimensional stationary spt phase we want , that it can represent any @xmath4-dimensional ( stationary ) spt phase we want , and that it is completely determined by these two pieces of information . except for the pumping interpretation ,",
    "these claims depend only on the hypothesis and the belief that it applies to discrete temporal translational symmetry as well as internal symmetries for a suitable definition of floquet spt phases .",
    "these are discussed in sec.[subsec : pumping_floquet_eigenstates_classification_floquet_spt_phases ] .",
    "f.   we will show that a similar decomposition exists for semidirect products @xmath14 , and more generally @xmath15 , whose applications to space group - protected spt phases will be discussed in sec.[subsec : applications_space_group_protected_spt_phases ] .",
    "g.   an enlargement of symmetry group can not only refine a classification but also eliminate certain phases , for a priori there may be obstructions to lifting an action of a smaller symmetry group over to a larger symmetry group . in sec.[subsec :",
    "obstruction_free_enlargement_symmetry_group ] , we will give a sufficient condition for the absence of such obstructions .",
    "more specifically , given @xmath16 , if one can find another subgroup @xmath17 such that @xmath18 , including the special case of direct product , then every @xmath19-protected spt phase will be representable by some @xmath5-protected spt phase .",
    "this claim follows immediately from the hypothesis .",
    "h.   there are other results derived from the hypothesis that we would rather defer to a subsequent paper due to our incomplete understanding .",

    "locality is defined differently for fermionic systems than for bosonic ( i.e.  spin ) systems @xcite .",
    "for this reason , classifications of bosonic phases and fermionic phases are traditionally done separately . while we will follow that tradition , our formalism works identically in the two cases .",
    "therefore , we can omit the qualifiers  fermionic \" and  bosonic \" and simply speak of  spt phases . \"    by the dimension of a physical system , we always mean the spatial dimension . when it comes to mathematical construction",
    ", it is convenient to allow dimensions to be negative .",

    "if a physical result appears to contain a free variable @xmath4 , then it should be understood that this result is valid for all @xmath20 for which all dimensions involved are non - negative .    for simplicity ,",
    "we assume all symmetry actions to be linear unitary .",
    "a generalization to antilinear antiunitary actions is possible ( see sec.[sec : summary_outlook ] ) but beyond the purview of this paper .",
    "we allow all topological groups satisfying the basic technical conditions in app.[subapp : technical_conventions ] to be symmetry groups .",
    "thus , a symmetry group can be finite or infinite , and discrete or non - discrete ( also called  continuous \" ) . in the non - discrete case , one must define what it means for a symmetry group @xmath5 to act on a hilbert space @xmath21 , that is whether we want a representation @xmath22 to be continuous , measurable - cochains as postulated in ref.@xcite reduces to the measurability of @xmath23 when @xmath24 .",
    "] , or something else , where @xmath25 denotes the space of unitary operators on @xmath21 @xcite . conceivably , the hypothesis can hold for one definition but fail for another , so some care is needed .",
    "it is possible that the validity of the hypothesis requires further restrictions on symmetry groups and symmetry actions , such as compactness and on - siteness , but there is a growing body of evidence @xcite against the necessity of such restrictions .",
    "it appears that discrete temporal translation @xcite , discrete spatial translation @xcite , and other space group actions @xcite may well fit into the same framework as on - site symmetry actions . in particular , refs.@xcite maintained that the classification of @xmath4-dimensional @xmath5-protected topological phases is the same whether @xmath5 is spatial or internal , provided that orientation - reversing symmetry operations ( e.g.parity ) are treated antiunitarily . in any case , on - site actions by finite groups are in the safe zone .",
