    "it is well known that the ground state of one - dimensional interacting electron systems is non - fermi liquid .",
    "the state , which is called as `` luttinger liquid '' , is characterized by a separation of spin and charge degrees of freedom , and anomalous exponents of correlation functions which depend on the interaction@xcite .",
    "the parallel chains of the interacting electrons coupled by the interchain hopping are basic models of quasi - one - dimensional electron systems .",
    "theoretical understanding of these systems is fundamental for studying electronic properties of organic conductors @xcite , high temperature superconductors @xcite and interacting electron systems applied to strong magnetic field ( fractional quantum hall effects ) @xcite . in addition , the problem is important as a first step toward studying two - dimensional interacting electron systems . consequently , there has been a growing interest in the system of the coupled chains , in particular two chains .",
    "several work have been devoted to investigating the two chains coupled by the interchain hopping for the case of spinless fermion@xcite and for the case including spin degree of freedom@xcite . in addition , anderson localization in such a system has been studied based on the above investigation@xcite .    however , interchain interaction also plays a role of the interchain coupling@xcite .",
    "therefore , by extending the work by finkelstein and larkin@xcite and that by schulz@xcite , we study the two chains of luttinger liquids in the presence of both the interchain hopping and the interchain interaction . to our knowledge ,",
    "much is not known about such a problem in the case including spin degree of freedom .",
    "we clarify the electronic properties originated from the interchain hopping by calculating excitation spectrum , phase diagram and susceptibilities .",
    "the gap appears in the excitation spectrum of the transverse fluctuations .",
    "this leads to splitting of the degenerated states in the absence of the hopping , `` in phase '' ordering states and `` out of phase '' ordering states between the chains . from the calculation of charge and spin susceptibilities with @xmath0 and @xmath1 being the longitudinal and transverse wavenumber",
    ", it is shown that both susceptibilities with @xmath2 are the same as those in the absence of the hopping , and those with @xmath3 show remarkable dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in ii ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is given and is expressed by use of the phase variables . in iii , we study the excitation spectrum and the phase diagram at @xmath4 with @xmath5 being temperature .",
    "the charge and the spin susceptibilities are also calculated .",
    "iv is devoted to discussion on the present results .",
    "we investigate the system where two chains of luttinger liquids are coupled by both the interchain hopping and the interchain interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 equations ( [ eqn:2.1 ] ) , ( [ eqn:2.2 ] ) and ( [ eqn:2.3 ] ) express the kinetic energy , the intrachain interaction and the interchain interaction , respectively .",

    "the interchain hopping and the length of the chain are defined by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the normalized quantities , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) denotes the matrix element of the interaction for the intrachain ( interchain ) forward scattering between particles moving oppositely . note that the conventional definition of the elements are given by @xmath24@xcite .",
    "we represent the above hamiltonian , eqs.([eqn:2.1 ] ) @xmath25 ( [ eqn:2.3 ] ) and the field operators of fermions in terms of phase variables based on bosonization method .",
    "the separation of the fermi wavenumber due to the hopping is taken into account by use of the unitary transformation , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) .",

    "this method is expected to be effective in the limit of strong coupling and has an advantage of the straightforward calculation of the several quantities .",
    "it should be noted that the break of the balance between @xmath112 and @xmath113 due to the misfit parameter may lead to the renormalization of @xmath114 defined by @xmath115 .",

    "the most dominant state between @xmath153 and @xmath154 for @xmath155 ( @xmath156 and @xmath157 for @xmath158 ) is determined by the total charge and spin fluctuations . by noting that the correlation functions for the total fluctuations are calculated as , @xmath159 we obtain the phase diagram in fig.[fig:2 ] .",
    "the exponent of the correlation function of cdw is the same as that of sdw , and the exponent of singlet superconductivity is the same as that of triplet superconductivity , respectively .",
    "this comes from the symmetry of the interaction for the spin degree of freedom , as is also seen in spin dependent tomonaga model with the isotropic interaction @xcite .",

    "this result seems to correspond to the fact that @xmath193 in the absence of the hopping is independent of @xmath192 ( see eq.([eqn : d16 ] ) ) .    in fig.[fig:3 ] , @xmath194 takes a minimum around @xmath195 in the case of @xmath196 and has a small dependence on @xmath0 and @xmath197 , being nearly unity for @xmath198 . on the other hand , @xmath199 in fig.[fig:4 ]",
    "takes the minimum for both @xmath196 and @xmath198 .",
    "the characteristic dependence is due to the separation of fermi wavenumber @xmath200 and the gap in the transverse fluctuation , both of which result from the interchain hopping .",

    "the @xmath0-dependence of charge and spin susceptibilities were calculated for both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the susceptibilities in the case of @xmath2 are the same as those in the absence of the hopping since the total dynamics is not affected by the hopping . on the other hand ,",
    "the static susceptibilities , @xmath194 for @xmath228 and @xmath229 in the case of @xmath3 show the minimum around @xmath195 which is ascribed to the separation of the fermi wavenumber and the excitation gaps of the transverse fluctuation in the presence of the interchain hopping .",
    "the fact that @xmath194 in the case of @xmath230 is larger than that in the case of @xmath231 is found also in the absence of the interchain hopping .",
    "we treated the system with the interaction processes of the forward scattering between the oppositely moving particles as the simplest model of luttinger liquid .",
    "however , the two chains coupled by the interchain hopping have been known to show the various properties depending on the parameters of the system .",
    "the repulsive backward scattering becomes relevant in the low energy limit and opens the gap in the excitations of the total spin , and thus modifies the electronic properties@xcite .",
    "this fact is different from the strictly one - dimensional case , where the repulsive backward scattering is renormalized to zero .",
    "the two chains of hubbard model shows the richer phases depending on the magnitude of the intrachain interaction , the interchain hopping and the filling@xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been reported that the two chains coupled by both the coulomb repulsion and the exchange interaction show the superconductivity @xcite .",
