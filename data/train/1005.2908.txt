    "most design optimisation problems in engineering are often highly nonlinear , involving many different design variables under complex constraints . these constraints can be written either as simple bounds such as the ranges of material properties , or as nonlinear relationships including maximum stress , maximum deflection , minimum load capacity , and geometrical configuration .",
    "such nonlinearity often results in multimodal response landscape .",
    "subsequently , local search algorithms such as hill - climbing and nelder - mead downhill simplex methods are not suitable , only global algorithms should be used so as to obtain optimal solutions ( deb 1995 , arora 1989 , yang 2005 , yang 2008 ) .",
    "modern metaheuristic algorithms have been developed with an aim to carry out global search , typical examples are genetic algorithms ( glodberg 1989 ) , particle swarm optimisation ( pso ) ( kennedy and eberhart 1995 , kennedy et al 2001 ) . the efficiency of metaheuristic algorithms can be attributed to the fact that they imitate the best features in nature , especially the selection of the fittest in biological systems which have evolved by natural selection over millions of years .",
    "two important characteristics of metaheuristics are : intensification and diversification ( blum and roli 2003 , gazi and passino 2004 , yang 2009 ) . intensification intends to search around the current best solutions and select the best candidates or solutions , while diversification makes sure that the algorithm can explore the search space more efficiently , often by randomization .",
    "recently , a new metaheuristic search algorithm , called cuckoo search ( cs ) , has been developed by yang and deb ( 2009 ) .",
    "preliminary studies show that it is very promising and could outperform existing algorithms such as pso . in this paper",
    ", we will further study cs and validate it against test functions including stochastic test functions .",
    "then , we will apply it to solve design optimisation problems in engineering .",
    "finally , we will discuss the unique features of cuckoo search and propose topics for further studies .",
    "in order to describe the cuckoo search more clearly , let us briefly review the interesting breed behaviour of certain cuckoo species .",
    "then , we will outline the basic ideas and steps of the proposed algorithm .",
    "cuckoo are fascinating birds , not only because of the beautiful sounds they can make , but also because of their aggressive reproduction strategy . some species such as the _ ani _ and _ guira _ cuckoos lay their eggs in communal nests , though they may remove others eggs to increase the hatching probability of their own eggs ( payne et al 2005 ) .",
    "quite a number of species engage the obligate brood parasitism by laying their eggs in the nests of other host birds ( often other species ) .",
    "there are three basic types of brood parasitism : intraspecific brood parasitism , cooperative breeding , and nest takeover .",
    "some host birds can engage direct conflict with the intruding cuckoos .",
    "if a host bird discovers the eggs are not its owns , it will either throw these alien eggs away or simply abandons its nest and builds a new nest elsewhere .",
    "some cuckoo species such as the new world brood - parasitic _ tapera _ have evolved in such a way that female parasitic cuckoos are often very specialized in the mimicry in colour and pattern of the eggs of a few chosen host species ( payne et al 2005 ) .",
    "this reduces the probability of their eggs being abandoned and thus increases their reproductivity .    furthermore , the timing of egg - laying of some species is also amazing .",
    "parasitic cuckoos often choose a nest where the host bird just laid its own eggs .",
    "in general , the cuckoo eggs hatch slightly earlier than their host eggs . once the first cuckoo chick is hatched , the first instinct action it will take is to evict the host eggs by blindly propelling the eggs out of the nest , which increases the cuckoo chick s share of food provided by its host bird ( payne et al 2005 ) .",
    "studies also show that a cuckoo chick can also mimic the call of host chicks to gain access to more feeding opportunity .      in nature , animals search for food in a random or quasi - random manner . in general ,",
    "the foraging path of an animal is effectively a random walk because the next move is based on the current location / state and the transition probability to the next location .",
    "which direction it chooses depends implicitly on a probability which can be modelled mathematically .",
    "for example , various studies have shown that the flight behaviour of many animals and insects has demonstrated the typical characteristics of lvy flights ( brown et al 2007 , reynods and frye 2007 , pavlyukevich 2007 ) .",
    "a recent study by reynolds and frye ( 2007 ) shows that fruit flies or _ drosophila melanogaster _ , explore their landscape using a series of straight flight paths punctuated by a sudden @xmath0 turn , leading to a lvy - flight - style intermittent scale - free search pattern .",
    "studies on human behaviour such as the ju/hoansi hunter - gatherer foraging patterns also show the typical feature of lvy flights .",
    "even light can be related to lvy flights ( barthelemy et al 2008 ) .",
    "subsequently , such behaviour has been applied to optimization and optimal search , and preliminary results show its promising capability ( shlesinger 2006 , pavlyukevich 2007 ) .      for simplicity in describing our new cuckoo search ( yang and deb 2009 )",
    ", we now use the following three idealized rules :    * each cuckoo lays one egg at a time , and dumps it in a randomly chosen nest ; * the best nests with high quality of eggs ( solutions ) will carry over to the next generations ; * the number of available host nests is fixed , and a host can discover an alien egg with a probability @xmath1 $ ] . in this case , the host bird can either throw the egg away or abandon the nest so as to build a completely new nest in a new location .    for simplicity , this last assumption can be approximated by a fraction @xmath2 of the @xmath3 nests being replaced by new nests ( with new random solutions at new locations ) . for a maximization problem",
    ", the quality or fitness of a solution can simply be proportional to the objective function . other forms of fitness can be defined in a similar way to the fitness function in genetic algorithms .",
    "based on these three rules , the basic steps of the cuckoo search ( cs ) can be summarised as the pseudo code shown in fig .",

    "the product @xmath14 means entry - wise multiplications .",
    "lvy flights essentially provide a random walk while their random steps are drawn from a lvy distribution for large steps ~u = t^- , ( 1 < 3 ) , which has an infinite variance with an infinite mean . here",
    "the consecutive jumps / steps of a cuckoo essentially form a random walk process which obeys a power - law step - length distribution with a heavy tail .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , in the real world , if a cuckoo s egg is very similar to a host s eggs , then this cuckoo s egg is less likely to be discovered , thus the fitness should be related to the difference in solutions .",
    "therefore , it is a good idea to do a random walk in a biased way with some random step sizes .",
    "a demo version is attached in the appendix ( this demo is not published in the actual paper , but as a supplement to help readers to implement the cuckoo search correctly ) .",
    "it is relatively easy to implement the algorithm , and then we have to benchmark it using test functions with analytical or known solutions . there are many benchmark test functions and there is no standard list or collection , though extensive descriptions of various functions do exist in literature ( floudas et al 1999 , hedar 2005 , molga and smutnicki 2005 ) .",
    "for example , michalewicz s test function has many local optima f()=-_i=1^d ( x_i ) ^2 m , ( m=10 ) , in the domain @xmath15 for @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of dimensions .",

    "here we have used @xmath24 nests , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . from the figure , we can see that , as the optimum is approaching , most nests aggregate towards the global optimum . in various simulations",
    ", we also notice that nests are also distributed at different ( local ) optima in the case of multimodal functions .",
    "this means that cs can find all the optima simultaneously if the number of nests are much higher than the number of local optima .",
    "this advantage may become more significant when dealing with multimodal and multiobjective optimization problems .",
    "we have also tried to vary the number of host nests ( or the population size @xmath3 ) and the probability @xmath2 .",
    "we have used @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 . from our simulations",
    ", we found that @xmath30 to @xmath31 and @xmath32 to @xmath33 are sufficient for most optimization problems .",
    "results and analysis also imply that the convergence rate , to some extent , is not sensitive to the parameters used .",
    "this means that the fine adjustment of algorithm - dependent parameters is not needed for any given problems .",
    "therefore , we will use @xmath24 and @xmath26 in the rest of the simulations , especially for the comparison studies presented later .",

    "we have seen that , for both test problems , cs has found the optimal solutions which are either better than or the same as the solutions found so far in literature .",
    "from the comparison study of the performance of cs with gas and pso , we know that our new cuckoo search in combination with lvy flights is very efficient and proves to be superior for almost all the test problems .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that there are fewer parameters to be fine - tuned in cs than in pso and genetic algorithms . in fact , apart from the population size @xmath3 , there is essentially one parameter @xmath2 . if we look at the cs algorithm carefully , there are essentially three components : selection of the best , exploitation by local random walk , and exploration by randomization via lvy flights globally .",
    "the selection of the best by keeping the best nests or solutions is equivalent to some form of elitism commonly used in genetic algorithms , which ensures the best solution is passed onto the next iteration and there is no risk that the best solutions are cast out of the population .",
    "the exploitation around the best solutions is performed by using a local random walk ^t+1=^t + _ t. if @xmath77 obeys a gaussian distribution , this becomes a standard random walk indeed .",
    "this is equivalent to the crucial step in pitch adjustment in harmony search ( geem et al 2001 , yang 2009 ) .",
    "if @xmath77 is drawn from a lvy distribution , the step of move is larger , and could be potentially more efficient",
    ". however , if the step is too large , there is risk that the move is too far away .",
    "fortunately , the elitism by keeping the best solutions makes sure that the exploitation moves are within the neighbourhood of the best solutions locally .    on the other hand , in order to sample the search space effectively so that new solutions to be generated are diverse enough , the exploration step is carried out in terms of lvy flights . in contrast , most metaheuristic algorithms use either uniform distributions or gaussian to generate new explorative moves ( geem et al 2001 , blum and rilo 2003 ) .",
    "if the search space is large , lvy flights are usually more efficient .",
    "a good combination of the above three components can thus lead to an efficient algorithm such as cuckoo search .",
    "furthermore , our simulations also indicate that the convergence rate is insensitive to the algorithm - dependent parameters such as @xmath2 .",
    "this also means that we do not have to fine tune these parameters for a specific problem .",
    "subsequently , cs is more generic and robust for many optimisation problems , comparing with other metaheuristic algorithms .    this potentially powerful optimisation strategy can easily be extended to study multiobjecitve optimization applications with various constraints , including np - hard problems .",
    "further studies can focus on the sensitivity and parameter studies and their possible relationships with the convergence rate of the algorithm .",
    "in addition , hybridization with other popular algorithms such as pso will also be potentially fruitful .",
    "more importantly , as for most metaheuristic algorithms , mathematical analysis of the algorithm structures is highly needed . at the moment , no such framework exists for analyzing metaheuristics in general .",
    "any progress in this area will potentially provide new insight into the understanding of how and why metaheuristic algorithms work .",

    "<S> a new metaheuristic optimisation algorithm , called cuckoo search ( cs ) , was developed recently by yang and deb ( 2009 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents a more extensive comparison study using some standard test functions and newly designed stochastic test functions . </S>",
    "<S> we then apply the cs algorithm to solve engineering design optimisation problems , including the design of springs and welded beam structures . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal solutions obtained by cs are far better than the best solutions obtained by an efficient particle swarm optimiser . </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss the unique search features used in cs and the implications for further research . </S>",
