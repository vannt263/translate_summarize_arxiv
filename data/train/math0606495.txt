    "it is a well - known fact of semiclassical microlocal analysis , that the analogue of hrmander s theorem on propagation of singularities for operators of real principal type @xcite holds for the semiclassical wavefront set ( also known as `` frequency set '' ) : it propagates along null bicharacteristics of operators with real principal symbol @xcite .",
    "given a lagrangian submanifold @xmath5 of @xmath6 we may introduce a finer notion of regularity , the local _ lagrangian _ regularity along @xmath7 we show here that on rational invariant tori in integrable systems , local lagrangian regularity not only propagates along bicharacteristics , but spreads in additional ways as well .",
    "let @xmath0 be a semiclassical pseudodifferential operator on a manifold @xmath8 with real principal symbol @xmath9 ( this is automatic if @xmath10 is self - adjoint ) .",
    "assume that the bicharacteristic flow of @xmath9 is completely integrable .",
    "( in fact we only need to assume integrability _ locally , _ near one invariant torus . )",
    "let @xmath3 be a family of quasimodes of @xmath11 i.e.assume that @xmath12 for some @xmath13 as @xmath14 either through a discrete sequence or continuously .",
    "( note that this certainly includes the possibility of letting @xmath3 be a sequence of actual eigenfunctions ) .",
    "let @xmath5 be an invariant torus in the characteristic set @xmath15 then the bicharacteristic flow is by definition tangent to @xmath16 and we show ( even in the absence of the integrability hypothesis ) that lagrangian regularity propagates along bicharacteristics  this is theorem  a below . if a single trajectory is dense in @xmath16 then this is the whole story for propagation , as the set on which lagrangian regularity holds is open , hence the whole torus either enjoys lagrangian regularity or none of it does . at the opposite extreme ,",
    "if @xmath5 is a torus on which all frequencis of the motion are rationally related , we may ask the finer question : what subsets of the space of all orbits may carry lagrangian regularity ?",
    "the answer ( assuming a nondegeneracy condition holds ) turns out to be somewhat constrained : given a single orbit , lagrangian regularity along a small tube around it implies lagrangian regularity along the orbit itself .",
    "this is our theorem  b. ( in the special case of two - dimensional tori , we can go further : again , either the whole torus enjoys lagrangian regularity or no points on it do . )",
    "the order of regularity up to which our result holds is constrained by the order of the quasimode .",
    "we speculate that a finer theorem may be obtainable by more authentically `` second - microlocal '' methods .    as a simple example of our main result , theorem  b",

    "[ section : flow ] below .",
    "the methods of proof ( and the idea of the paper ) arose from work of burq - zworski @xcite and a subsequent refinement by burq - hassell - wunsch @xcite on the spreading of @xmath34 mass for quasimodes on the bunimovich stadium .",
    "the central argument here is a generalization of the methods used to prove that a quasimode can not concentrate too heavily in the interior of the rectangular part of the stadium ( which is essentially the example discussed above on @xmath35 ) .",
    "we remark that our hypotheses in this paper are quite far from those in the study of `` quantum integrable systems '' where one examines eigenfunctions of a system of @xmath36 commuting operators on an @xmath36-manifold .",
    "for instance , if we take @xmath37 on the torus , with @xmath38 a real valued , smooth bump - function , then the operator @xmath0 satisfies the hypotheses of our theorems a and b , and yet there does not exist a system of @xmath39 other operators commuting with @xmath11 with independent symbols .",
    "moreover , even in the completely integrable case , given that we study eigenfunctions of a single operator , it may be possible to use the degeneracy of the system to construct non- or partially - lagrangian quasimodes .",
    "little seems to be known in this direction .",
    "the author is grateful to andrs vasy for helpful discussions on lagrangian regularity , and to clark robinson for introducing him to isoenergetic nondegeneracy .",
