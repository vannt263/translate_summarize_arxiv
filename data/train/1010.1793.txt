    "intrinsically localized modes , or discrete solitons ( breathers ) , appear as generic excitations in a large variety of physical systems @xcite , where spatial periodicity ( or discreteness ) provides gaps in the linear dispersion relation and nonlinearity allows for detuning the oscillation frequencies into these gaps , resulting in spatial localization .",
    "particularly important applications of discrete nonlinear systems are nonlinear optical waveguide arrays @xcite , with possibilities to change and control all essential parameters , such as geometry , dimensionality , nonlinearity , beam angle , etc . for weakly coupled waveguides ,",
    "the relevant mathematical description , derived via coupled mode theory @xcite , is a hamiltonian lattice equation of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) type @xcite , where the particular type of nonlinearity depends on the nonlinear response of the medium .",
    "the most studied case is a dnls equation with cubic on - site nonlinearity@xcite , corresponding to a kerr medium @xcite , which also appears generically as a modulational equation for the small - amplitude dynamics in chains of coupled anharmonic oscillators @xcite .",
    "however , photorefractive media also enables the generation of discrete spatial solitons @xcite , and the corresponding lattice model is a dnls equation with saturable nonlinearity ( s - dnls ) which was studied in a number of theoretical works @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting property of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) s - dnls model @xcite is the existence of certain `` sliding velocities '' , where localized discrete solitons may travel in the lattice without radiation .",
    "this behavior was connected to the existence of `` transparent points '' associated with the vanishing of a so - called peierls - nabarro ( pn ) potential barrier @xcite , usually defined as the difference in energy ( hamiltonian ) at constant power ( norm ) between the two fundamental localized stationary solutions centered at one site ( odd mode ) and symmetrically in between two sites ( even mode ) .",
    "close to the points of vanishing of this energy difference are regions of stability exchange between the even and odd solutions , associated in general with the appearance of a family of intermediate , asymmetric stationary solutions , connecting both types of symmetric solutions at the bifurcation points @xcite .",
    "the existence of regimes of enhanced mobility close to such bifurcation points is also well - known from studies of other one - dimensional lattice models @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is still an open issue whether moving discrete solitons may exist as localized , radiationless modes also in two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattices .",
    "as was shown numerically in @xcite , a scenario with exchange of stability through bifurcations with asymmetric stationary solutions appears also for the 2d saturable model in a square ( isotropic ) lattice , involving in this case three different types of fundamental solutions @xcite : one - site ( odd - odd , oo ) , two - site ( odd - even , oe ) , and four - site ( even - even , ee ) modes .",
    "it was also shown numerically in @xcite , that solutions with good ( but generally not radiationless ) mobility in the axial directions may exist in these regimes , and that the necessary energy needed for rendering a mobile stable stationary solution agreed well with the concept of pn - barrier , if its definition was extended to take into account also the energy for the relevant intermediate stationary solution ( an analogous situation is well - known for the pn potential of kinks @xcite ) .",
    "very similar observations were also made later for a 2d dnls model with cubic - quintic nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the low - power regime of the 2d s - dnls equations , good mobility was also observed in diagonal directions @xcite .",
    "however , the relation between existence of regions of stability exchange , small pn - barrier and mobile localized solutions in 2d is not that trivial , as shown , e.g. , for a model with cubic inter - site nonlinearities in @xcite : even in regimes with small pn barrier and existence of intermediate solutions , the mobility may be very poor , if there is no continuous path in phase space passing close to the relevant stationary modes . on the other hand ,",
    "as was observed for the low - power ( i.e. , close to continuum limit ) regime of a 2d lattice with quadratic nonlinearity in @xcite , the effective peierls - nabarro potential may in some situations be weak enough to allow mobility in _ arbitrary _ directions , without any direct connection to bifurcations and symmetry - broken stationary solutions .",
    "so there is clearly need for a better understanding of the conditions for mobility in 2d lattices .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to generalize the concept of pn - barrier as discussed above , and introduce a full 2d pn potential surface describing the pseudo - potential landscape in - between all stationary modes .",
    "we will use a numerical constrained newton - raphson ( nr ) method , previously applied to 1d lattices in @xcite , to explicitly construct these surfaces for the 2d saturable model from @xcite , and show how parameter regimes and directions of good mobility may be immediately identified from smooth , flat parts of these surfaces .",
    "we will also illustrate how the interplay between translational motion in one lattice direction and oscillatory motion in the orthogonal direction can be intuitively understood from the topology of the corresponding pn surfaces .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "we also here show examples on how simultaneous excitation of transverse oscillation modes may affect discrete solitons moving slowly in axial directions . in sec .",
    "[ anisotropy ] , we analyze effects of adding a weak anisotropy to the lattices in the parameter regimes used in previous sections , in order mainly to investigate whether this may promote mobility in directions different from the axial or diagonal ones ( which presumably would be associated with the appearance of additional `` valleys '' in the pn potential surface ) . finally , in sec .",

    "@xcite consists on eliminating one equation from the newton - raphson problem , the one of the constrained amplitude which is not anymore an unknown variable .",

    "since we are interested in the energy landscape around the fundamental stationary solutions , we will assume also the amplitude @xmath13 of the constrained solutions to be real and positive on the constraint sites .",

    "the choice for positions @xmath47 and @xmath48 is evidently not unique , but in order to most efficiently trace out a smooth energy landscape connecting the fundamental solutions ( if it exists ) , the constraint sites should preferably be chosen within the unit cell where the amplitudes are large .",
    "it turned out that , starting from a stationary one - site solution centered at @xmath54 , in most cases the best option is to choose the first constraint at site @xmath55 or @xmath56 , and the other one at site @xmath57 , as sketched in fig .",

    "instead , the nr method with constraints on these sites generally converges , at @xmath58 , to a two - site diagonal solution ( which as remarked in sec .",
    "[ stat ] is an exact solution to the unconstrained equation only for large @xmath2 ) , which is not expected to be relevant for the mobility process .",

    "we could trace some specific mobility directions ( e.g. , along lattice axes or diagonal ) connecting stationary solutions with almost equal hamiltonian , but not the full two - dimensional scenario involving all fundamental solutions .",
    "note also that , as remarked in @xcite , for large @xmath2 and small power the s - dnls model essentially behaves as a cubic dnls model with effective nonlinearity @xmath61 .",
    "consequently , we could not find complete energy surfaces with all fundamental solutions for the cubic dnls either ( although surfaces involving the two - site diagonal solution in place of the ee solution could be obtained as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ constraint ] ; for the cubic dnls this two - site solution does exist as a true stationary solution above some threshold level of power @xcite ) . on the other hand , for very small values of @xmath2 ,",
    "the computation of energy surfaces becomes difficult for technical reasons : due to the widening of the solutions , considerably larger lattices are needed to remove the influence from boundary effects .",
    "therefore , in the following , we will present the main phenomenology for the isotropic case ( @xmath8 ) found for intermediate values of @xmath2 , @xmath62 , where complete surfaces involving all four fundamental solutions are obtained for all values of the power .",
    "we will show results for the particular value @xmath63 , but the scenario is found to be qualitatively the same for all @xmath2 in this interval .    from fig .",
    "[ pl ] ( c ) , we may identify essentially five different regimes where energy surfaces of qualitatively different nature should be expected , depending on the level of power .",

    "[ pot1 ] ( b ) is almost flat between the one - site and two - site solutions in the axial directions , leading to the very good axial mobility shown in fig .",

    "[ dynamics ] , the easiest mobility in this case is expected to occur in a diagonal direction , connecting the two stable stationary solutions .",
    "the fourth regime corresponds to simultaneously stable two- and four - site solutions .",

    "for @xmath113 , a new region of stability of the oo mode appears around @xmath114 , leading to a small window of multistability where the oo , eo and ee modes are stable simultaneously .",
    "an example of an energy surface from this regime is shown in fig .",
    "[ anpot1 ] ( a ) , where also two intermediate solutions [ white dots ] can be found on the edges .",
    "there is also a regime with bistability of the oo and ee modes only , as illustrated by the pseudo - potential surface in fig .",
    "[ anpot1 ] ( b ) .",
    "note that , in this case , the intermediate solution does not leave the edge , in contrast to the is2 mode existing on the diagonal between the one- and four- site solutions for the isotropic case of simultaneously stable eo / oe solution [ fig .",
    "[ pot1 ] ( c ) ] .",
    "since anisotropy destroys the symmetry between the oe and eo solutions , bistability of both 2-site solutions disappears already for a small amount of anisotropy , and for smaller @xmath7 the is position can only be found on an edge of the potential surface .",
    "thus , since no additional `` valleys '' were found to develop in the pn surfaces ( all minima appear on the edges ) , the best mobility for anisotropic lattices should generally be expected to occur along lattice directions ( at least in cases where diagonal coupling terms can be neglected , as assumed throughout this work ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied in a deeper way the problem of mobility of localized modes in two - dimensional saturable discrete systems .",
    "we numerically implemented a constrained newton - raphson method to construct full peierls - nabarro energy surfaces , which appeared as very useful tools for predicting the dynamical properties of localized excitations .",
    "although these surfaces were never found to be completely flat ( and therefore the corresponding peierls - nabarro barriers is strictly never zero ) , parameter regimes and directions of good mobility were seen to correspond to smooth , flat parts of the surfaces .    for the isotropic saturable model",
    ", five different surface topologies could be identified in different power regimes , depending on the stability properties of the different fundamental stationary solitons . by numerically studying the dynamics of perturbed stationary solutions",
    ", we showed how these different topologies yielded qualitatively different kinds of optimal mobility , generally in axial or diagonal directions and with velocities varying according to the shape of the potential while the profile is propagating across the lattice .",
    "the energy surfaces were also found to be very useful for interpreting the dynamics resulting from the interplay between translational and oscillatory motion in orthogonal directions .",
    "we also studied the effect of weak anisotropy , where the breaking of the symmetry of the system also yields energy surfaces with lower symmetry .",
    "in addition , we showed how this symmetry breaking could lead to a change of stability properties for the fundamental stationary solutions , and as a result two new types of surface topologies were identified . from the shape of these surfaces",
    ", we predicted that the best mobility in the anisotropic case should generally occur along lattice directions .",
    "thus , the method developed here appears to be a very good tool for the understanding of the mobility dynamics of localized excitations in higher - dimensional lattices , clearly showing the `` real '' energy barriers that localized solutions experience .",
    "we hope that this approach will be useful also for other types of nonlinar lattice models .    finally , from an application point of view",
    ", we have given further examples on how the saturable nature of nonlinearity promotes the generation of many different stability and mobility scenarios .",
    "the example presented in section [ dynamics ] shows the possibility to steer the dynamics of the solution by using the natural frequencies of its own self - induced potential . as an application of this",
    ", we propose a discriminative optical switch which , for example , will only be activated when @xmath41 and @xmath81 positions are - simultaneously - an integer number .",
    "this is one more example of nonlinear lattices being the key to success for controlling the propagation of light in future all - optical technologies .",
