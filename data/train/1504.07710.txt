    ", we have overcome the difficulties @xcite by restricting ourselves to those with @xmath51 supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "similarly , here in the theories of the @xmath13-type quivers , the difficulty is resolved by choosing the quivers with uniform @xmath33 , as in section [ specialinst ] .",
    "for these special values of the levels , we have found that the non - perturbative corrections consist of three kinds of instantons , and have also observed that the constant @xmath19 can be expressed in terms of that in the abjm theory ( at least up to @xmath49 ) .",
    "these are reminiscent of the results for the theories of the @xmath12-type quivers with the @xmath51 supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see whether the symmetry is enhanced for these cases with uniform @xmath33 . also , we hope to interpret these instanton exponents from the dual supergravity picture , as membranes wrapping on the tri - sasaki einstein manifold , though the geometry is more complicated than that for the @xmath12-type quivers .",
    "furthermore , we hope to proceed to all the non - perturbative corrections including the worldsheet instantons which have not been discussed at all in this work .    after seeing the fermi gas formalism for the theories of the @xmath113-type and @xmath52-type quivers",
    ", it should be interesting to ask whether a fermi gas formalism exists also for the @xmath14-type quivers . also , it is interesting to study other quivers with orthosymplectic groups in @xcite from the fermi gas formalism .",
    "see e.g.  @xcite .",

    "* remark*. this is the continuum limit @xmath277 of the following proposition ( see e.g.  proposition 2.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "note that , in taking the limit , we use @xmath278 , which follows from @xmath279 and @xmath280 , and fix the overall signs by setting @xmath270 to be zero .    * proposition*. let @xmath281 with @xmath282 be a skew - symmetric matrix .",
