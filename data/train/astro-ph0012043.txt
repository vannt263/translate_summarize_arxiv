    "x - ray timing has historically led to fundamental understanding of many phenomena , such as accretion - powered pulsars , low - mass x - ray binaries , and strongly magnetized neutron stars .",
    "x - ray timing has unique power because timing signals are often clean diagnostics of systems , and hence lead directly to physical understanding . here",
    "we discuss recent results of x - ray timing .",
    "in particular , we focus on aspects of fundamental physics that can be addressed with timing observations .",
    "physics in ultrastrong magnetic fields , high densities , and strong gravity can all be tested with such observations , which reveal truly small - scale structure , from the @xmath0  cm sizes of neutron stars and black holes to the @xmath1  cm radii of nucleons . in ",
    "2 we consider strongly magnetized neutron stars , and the evidence for them apparent in timing observations . in   3",
    "we discuss thermonuclear propagation in x - ray bursts , and what it might tell us about such propagation in other astrophysical settings , such as type  ia supernovae . in   4",
    "we examine what has been learned about strong gravity and dense matter through x - ray timing observations . finally , in   5 we consider future prospects , and the exciting qualitative advances in these fundamental subjects that are expected from observations with a large - area x - ray timing mission",
    "it has long been recognized ( e.g. , erber 1966 ) that in magnetic fields @xmath2  g , many otherwise insignificant microphysical processes become important or even dominant .",
    "such processes include single photon pair production , photon splitting , and the existence of a vacuum resonance frequency . terrestrial laboratories",
    "are unable to reproduce the combination of high magnetic field and high photon energy or high electron lorentz factor necessary to test the predictions of quantum electrodynamics in these extreme conditions .",
    "the study of high - field neutron stars is therefore important for fundamental physics as well as for the astrophysical understanding it brings .",
    "observations of soft gamma - ray repeaters provide the best current evidence for supercritical magnetic fields @xmath3 .",
    "the first detection of soft gamma - ray repeaters was made in 1979 , with the detection of a giant burst on 5 march 1979 from the source sgr 052966 in the large magellanic cloud ( mazets et al .",
    "1979 ) it was only much later that this source and two similar ones ( sgr  1900 + 14 and sgr  180620 ) were recognized as a class potentially distinct from classical gamma - ray bursts .",
    "these three sources , a more recently detected fourth member of the class ( sgr  162741 ; woods et al .",
    "1999 ) , and possibly even a fifth ( sgr  180123 ; cline et al .",
    "2000 ) have long quiescent periods of relatively steady @xmath4 erg  s@xmath5 x - ray emission punctuated by episodes of bursting behavior .",
    "the bursts are typically short , from @xmath6  s to @xmath7  s , and have peak estimated isotropic luminosities of @xmath8  erg  s @xmath5 .",
    "the spectra are quasithermal , with a peak energy at @xmath9  kev .",
    "the first suggestion that soft gamma - ray repeaters might be  magnetars \" with supercritical magnetic field strengths was made by thompson & duncan ( 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "the cleanest evidence in favor of the magnetar hypothesis has come from timing observations .",
    "modulation of the persistent x - ray emission from sgr  180620 was detected during the november 1996 active period ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1998 ) , at a period of 7.5  s and with a period derivative @xmath10  s  yr@xmath5 .",
    "interpreted using the standard dipole braking model , these values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 imply a surface dipole field of @xmath13  g , nearly twenty times the quantum critical field . similarly , the @xmath14  s  yr@xmath5 spindown of sgr  1900 + 14 ( kouveliotou et al .  1999 ) plus its 5.2  s period also implies a surface dipole field of @xmath15  g in this source .",
    "the discovery of the high magnetic field inferred from dipole spindown models of sgr  180620 and sgr  1900 + 14 is a dramatic confirmation of the magnetar model .",
    "alternative models must of course be considered .",
    "for example , marsden , rothschild , & ligenfelter ( 1999 ) have noted that the environments of sgrs are unusually dense , and have suggested that accretion must therefore be reconsidered as the driving mechanism for sgr behavior .",
    "however , the nature of the spindown supports strongly the interpretation that sgrs have supercritical magnetic fields , and hence are unique laboratories for the predictions of quantum electrodynamics in ultrastrong magnetic fields .",
    "prior to the launch of the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) it was expected theoretically ( e.g. , joss 1978 ; fryxell & woosley 1982 ; nozakura , ikeuchi , & fujimoto 1984 ; bildsten 1995 ) that ignition would happen at some point in the fuel layer and then spread , so that burning would not be uniform over the entire star .",
    "these expectations were confirmed by the discovery of brightness oscillations during thermonuclear x - ray bursts from several neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( for reviews see strohmayer , zhang , & swank 1997 ; van der klis 2000 ) .",
    "these brightness oscillations are highly coherent ( @xmath16fwhm@xmath17 ; see , e.g. , strohmayer & markwardt 1999 ) and are extremely stable in their frequency from burst to burst in a given source ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1998 ) . their coherence and stability , plus the recent report of a burst oscillation in the x - ray millisecond pulsar sax  j1808 - 3658 with a frequency equal to the spin frequency ( in t zand et al . 2000 ) , establishes that the oscillations occur at the spin frequency or its first overtone .",
    "the physical picture is that ignition happens at some spot on the surface , and the burning then propagates away from this spot . at a given moment",
    ", there is therefore a hot spot on the surface .",
    "rotational modulation as seen by a distant observer then produces the observed oscillations .",
    "the linear rotational velocity , @xmath18 , is much greater than the @xmath19  cm  s@xmath5 velocity expected for thermonuclear propagation , and hence the rotational modulation provides a series of snapshots of the burning as it propagates .",
    "the study of thermonuclear propagation in x - ray bursts has broad implications for other propagation phenomena , such as classical novae and type  ia supernovae .",
    "sne  ia are especially important to understand because of their unique value as probes of the expansion of the universe and of the possible existence of a cosmological constant . however , these sources are difficult to model numerically , due to the large range of length scales involved ( from the @xmath20  cm thickness of flame fronts to the @xmath21  cm radius of the pre - sn white dwarf ) .",
    "observations are also challenging , because the propagation of burning happens primarily deep within the white dwarf , and a given source only has one episode of such propagation in its lifetime .",
    "this means that , even on such issues as whether the propagation happens as a deflagration ( slower than the sound speed @xmath22 in the unburned material ) or a detonation ( faster than @xmath22 ) , and the expected transition between those propagation regimes , there is considerable uncertainty .",
    "observation of thermonuclear propagation during x - ray bursts offers a different path by which these processes can be understood .",
    "the burning happens close to the surface ( @xmath23meters ) , where it is relatively easily observed , and happens frequently for a given source , so many observations can be made .",
    "careful measurement of burst brightness oscillations , especially with a future high - area timing instrument , therefore holds promise for the elucidation of thermonuclear propagation in other circumstances such as type  ia supernovae .",
    "one recent result about propagation emerged from study of the burst source 4u  1636536 , in which the dominant 580  hz brightness oscillation is at twice the spin frequency ( miller 1999 ) .",
    "this is interpreted as the existence of two nearly antipodal hot spots on the surface , perhaps the result of two pools of fuel ( e.g. , at the magnetic poles ) . in general ,",
    "ignition is expected to happen at one pole first , then propagate to the other , so the rapidity with which the 580  hz oscillation appears indicates the speed of propagation . in the case of 4u  1636536 , the 580  hz oscillation appears within 0.03  s of the burst onset .",
    "combined with the @xmath24  cm between antipodes , this implies a propagation velocity @xmath25  cm  s@xmath5 , much larger than the @xmath0  cm  s@xmath5 expected in some models of turbulent deflagration waves ( see , e.g. , fryxell & woosley 1982 ; nozakura et al .  1984 ) .",
    "these numbers point to one of many qualitative advances that would be possible with an x - ray timing mission with 10x the collecting area of rxte .",
    "the speed of sound in the unburned medium is expected to be @xmath26  cm  s@xmath5 . with the observed signal strength , an instrument with ten times",
    "rxte s area would be able to resolve propagation velocities up to @xmath27  cm  s@xmath5 , and would therefore be able to distinguish between deflagration and a detonation and possibly see a transition between the two burning regimes .",
    "this would be a major advance in the understanding of thermonuclear propagation in general .",
    "many of the most dramatic advances afforded by x - ray timing have occurred in the last few years , in the subjects of strong gravity and dense matter .",
    "this is a direct result of the high area , fast timing , and high telemetry rate of the rossi x - ray timing explorer . in this section",
    "we summarize what has been learned from high - frequency brightness oscillations from neutron stars and black holes , and in the next section we discuss the dramatic qualitative advances in our understanding that would be made possible by a future timing mission with ten times the area of rxte .",
    "in addition to brightness oscillations during x - ray bursts ( discussed in the previous section ) , the major discovery with rxte was the existence of khz quasiperiodic brightness oscillations ( qpos ) in neutron - star low - mass x - ray binary systems and the existence of a number of qpos in accreting black holes .",
    "the qpos in neutron stars are seen from @xmath2320 systems , and a number of trends have been established ( see van der klis 2000 for a review ) .",
    "these qpos ( 1 )  often appear as two simultaneous peaks in a power density spectrum , ( 2 )  are relatively sharp and strong , with @xmath28fwhm up to @xmath29 in some cases and fractional rms amplitudes up to 15% in the 2 - 60  kev range of the proportional counter array on rxte , ( 3 )  tend to increase in frequency as the inferred mass accretion rate increases , ( 4 )  have a separation frequency between the two peaks that often decreases with increasing peak frequency , ( 5 )  have a maximum separation frequency that is close to the spin frequency inferred from burst brightness oscillations .",
    "a number of models have been proposed for this phenomenon ( see van der klis 2000 and references therein ) . for the reasons discussed in miller ( 2000 ) , we favor beat - frequency mechanisms , in which the upper peak frequency is close to the frequency of a circular orbit at some special radius , and the lower peak is generated by a beat of that frequency with radiation modulated at the stellar spin frequency ( miller , lamb , & psaltis 1998 ) . however , many of the most important inferences about strong gravity and dense matter from these oscillations can be derived more generally , from the widely accepted idea that the upper peak frequency @xmath30 is an orbital frequency .",
    "there are two simple considerations that yield a constraint on the mass @xmath31 and the radius @xmath32 of a neutron star , from the observation of an orbital frequency @xmath33 .",
    "first , the orbit is obviously outside the star .",
    "second , the orbit must also be outside the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , because otherwise there would be rapid inspiral and any resulting oscillation would last at most a few cycles , leading to a broad qpo , in conflict with observations . as shown by miller et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , these limits constrain the mass of the star to be @xmath34 and the circumferential radius to be @xmath35  km , to first order in the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the stellar angular momentum ( @xmath38 for a neutron star with a spin frequency of 300  hz , and the spacetime is unique to first order in @xmath39 ) .",
    "together , the observation of a given orbital frequency restricts the mass and radius to be inside a wedge in a @xmath40 diagram ; the larger the frequency , the more restrictive the constraint .",
    "the highest frequency yet observed , 1330  hz ( van straaten et al . 2000 ) , rules out the hard equation of state l ( labeled as in miller et al .",
    "this is the first time that an astrophysical observation has been able to rule out a hard equation of state .",
    "this is therefore a major advance in our understanding of the dense matter in the cores of neutron stars .",
    "as first discussed in 1996 , an even more major advance would occur if strong evidence were found for the existence of the isco .",
    "this is because the existence of unstable circular orbits is a qualitatively new feature of general relativity compared to newtonian gravity , and is an essential component of models of accreting black holes on all scales as well as of inspiraling compact objects and other phenomena . given that observed frequencies increase with increasing @xmath41 , but that @xmath42 is an upper limit to the frequency of the upper peak , it was expected that there would be a rollover in the slope of the @xmath43 curve for both the upper and lower peaks ( miller et al .",
    "moreover , the frequency at which the curve rolled over has to be a constant , for many observations of a given source .",
    "this may have been seen in rxte data from 4u  182030 by zhang et al .",
    "if so , this is a tremendous discovery ; not only is this strong confirmation of the prediction of the isco , but it implies a neutron star gravitational mass of @xmath44 , which limits the possible high - density equation of state severely . given these dramatic implications , care must be taken in the interpretation of the data .",
    "the main question is whether the rollover really happens as a function of @xmath41 , or whether the countrate change is indicative of a spectral state change .",
    "further observations and additional sources with this signature would help immensely .",
    "this is one of the many potential benefits of a future large - area timing instrument .",
    "there are many different types of quasiperiodic oscillations from black hole sources discovered with rxte .",
    "one that has been seen in the microquasars grs  1915 + 105 and gro  j165540 is particularly intriguing .",
    "the frequency appears not to change with luminosity in either source ( fixed at 67  hz for grs  1915 + 105 and at @xmath45300  hz for gro  j165540 ) . in grs  1915 + 105",
    "the feature can be fairly sharp , with a maximum @xmath46 .",
    "these qpos are much weaker than many qpos seen in neutron star sources , with typical rms amplitudes @xmath231% .",
    "they are therefore more difficult to study , and less is known about them .",
    "however , their fixed frequency suggests that they are related to some fundamental quantity or radius in the system ; possibilities include frame - dragging frequencies due to lense - thirring precession or periastron advance ( e.g. , stella , vietri , & morsink 1999 ) , and disk oscillation modes ( e.g. , nowak et al .",
    "regardless of the physical origin of these qpos , the matter generating the oscillations is close enough to the black hole that it must in some sense reflect the strongly curved spacetime .",
    "it is therefore expected that , especially with the well - characterized waveforms available with a large - area timing mission , the mass and spin of the black hole could be inferred , and potentially the spacetime itself might be probed .",
    "an x - ray timing satellite with ten times the collecting area of rxte would be the first instrument able to characterize accurately the waveforms and energy - dependent phase lags of the high - frequency qpos observed from compact objects in low - mass x - ray binaries . as described below",
    ", these waveforms and phase lags encode otherwise inaccessible information about strong gravity and the properties of the compact objects . with this capability ,",
    "such an instrument would test quantitatively the predictions of general relativity in the highly curved spacetime near neutron stars and black holes .",
    "it would also make fundamentally new contributions to our understanding of the properties of matter at supranuclear densities .",
    "the waveform from a rotating hot spot during a burst oscillation or persistent emission is affected by gravitational light deflection and doppler shifts . by fitting the waveform",
    "one can therefore constrain simultaneously the mass and radius of the star , and hence the equation of state of matter beyond nuclear saturation density , which is an issue of central importance in nuclear physics research . fig .",
    "1a shows that observations from a large - area timing instrument would bring an unprecedented level of precision to our understanding of high - density matter . in this simulation",
    "we assume a neutron star of gravitational mass 1.8  @xmath47 with high - density equation of state uu , and assume that the hot spot is a small spot on the rotational equator , as seen by a distant observer in the rotational plane .",
    "we simulate five bursts which had 5% rms oscillations at 364  hz for five seconds each .",
    "modern equations of state have mass - radius curves that span approximately the range between the fps and uu equations of state ( akmal , pandharipande , & ravenhall 1998 ) .",
    "it is clear that measurements of this type for several different neutron stars would exclude most of these eos .",
    "these results would therefore have direct feedback on nuclear physics .",
    "similarly , accurate measurement of the waveforms of luminous clumps around a black hole would yield a precise mass for the hole and strong constraints on the kerr spin parameter @xmath48 .",
    "it may even be possible to detect the frequency chirp produced as a clump moves inside the last stable orbit ( sunyaev 1973 , stoeger 1980 ) .",
    "the high velocity of surface rotation during bursts or persistent coherent emission also doppler - boosts the energies of photons from the hot spot , causing high - energy photons to lead low - energy photons by a phase that depends on the precise value of the surface velocity and therefore on the stellar radius , for fixed frequency .",
    "this effect was first pointed out by ford ( 1999 ) in an analysis of rxte data on bursts from aql  x-1 , and has also been analyzed for the coherent oscillations from the millisecond x - ray pulsar sax  j18083658 by weinberg , miller , & lamb ( 2000 ) and ford ( 2000 ) . in fig .",
    "1b we simulate a fit to such phase lag data , with an assumed gravitational mass of @xmath49 and equation of state uu , and phase uncertainties taken from the sax  j18083658 data .",
    "this figure shows that although rxte is not sufficiently sensitive to provide useful constraints , an observation with a future large - area timing instrument would yield tight limits on the mass and the radius of this neutron star , and hence on the equation of state of high - density matter .",
    "the most exciting prospect of a high - area timing mission is that data from it could test quantitatively the predictions of general relativity in strong gravity . in the previous sections we have discussed several independent methods of estimating the mass , radius , or angular momentum of an individual neutron star or black hole .",
    "these include waveform and phase lag fits and the detection of an isco and the associated orbital frequency .",
    "the combination of all these independent measurements overdetermines the problem so that the underlying theories get tested .",
    "for example , the various estimates of the mass of the central object will agree with each other only if general relativity is the correct theory of gravity , because general relativity is assumed in making the estimates .",
    "this would provide a powerful test of its predictions in a regime that is otherwise not accessible , and would continue the legacy of x - ray timing as a clean measuring tool for fundamental physics and astrophysics ."
