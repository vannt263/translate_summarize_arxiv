    "<S> we perform an event - by - event analysis of the transverse momentum distribution of final state particles in central pb(160agev)+pb collisions within a microscopic non - equilibrium transport model ( urqmd ) </S>",
    "<S> . strong influence of rescattering is found . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted momentum distributions show less fluctuations in a+a collisions than in p+p reactions . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to simplified p+p extrapolations and random walk models .    </S>",
    "<S> # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 )    the approach to thermalization in relativistic heavy ion collision has gained a lot of attention in the last year . </S>",
    "<S> it has been intensively investigated experimentally and theoretically @xcite . however , very new event - by - event fluctuation data shed new light onto this topic . </S>",
    "<S> momentum fluctuations are due to the finite particle number and the reaction dynamics . in thermal equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> they are connected to the heat capacity of nuclear matter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additional insight may also be gained by studying particle number fluctuations which are connected to another key quantitity , namely the compressibility of hadronic matter under extreme conditions @xcite .    in this letter we perform an event - by - event analysis of central ( b@xmath03  fm ) pb+pb collisions at 160 agev within the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics model ( urqmd ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> urqmd is a microscopic hadronic transport approach based on the covariant propagation of mesonic and baryonic degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> it allows for rescattering and the formation and decay of resonances and strings . for further details about the urqmd model , </S>",
    "<S> the reader is referred to ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this investigation is to analyse the fluctuations of event - by - event distributions both in p+p and nucleus - nucleus reactions . </S>",
    "<S> one of such distributions is the transverse momentum distribution . </S>",
    "<S> it seems obvious that these fluctuations are larger for p+p reactions than for a+a collisions . in p+p reactions , we have strong correlations in particle emissions mainly due to conservation laws @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations are , however , reduced in a+a collisions due to the larger amount of energy available in the system and due to rescattering of secondaries . indeed , urqmd calculations show these fluctuations to be much smaller in pb+pb than in p+p , due to the large amount of meson - baryon ( mb ) and meson - meson ( mm ) rescattering . to illustrate this scenario fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ densi ] shows the time evolution of the baryon- ( full line ) and meson ( dotted line ) densities in pb+pb at 160 agev . </S>",
    "<S> after 4  fm / c the baryons have complete spatial overlap with the mesons resulting in high scattering rates with secondaries .    for our purpose </S>",
    "<S> , it is convenient to introduce the momentum correlation parameter @xmath1 defined as @xcite : : = -,z=^n_i=1z_i , z_i = p__i- [ eq1 ] and @xmath2 as the particle averaged transverse momentum , @xmath3 denotes the particle averaged @xmath4 , @xmath5 the average number of particles per event and @xmath6 is the event averaged @xmath7 .    even though this correlation parameter @xmath1 is not defined in an obvious way ( a careful analysis of this quantity </S>",
    "<S> is considered in @xcite ) we make use of it to compare our results to recent investigations @xcite </S>",
    "<S> .    this variable @xmath1 can provide insight into the emission dynamics of particles in the course of the collision . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 values can best be classified as follows :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 : + this indicates that both fluctuations in p+p and a+a are identical . </S>",
    "<S> it corresponds to a simple extrapolation of proton - proton collisions to describe a+a . </S>",
    "<S> this is done e.g. in the fritiof model ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ phi ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 : + the emitted particles in a+a are less correlated than they are in p+p . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case in thermal models . </S>",
    "<S> however , urqmd shows this behaviour due to the large number of secondary mb and mm collisions ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ phi ] ) 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 : + the momenta of the particles emitted in a+a are more strongly correlated than they are in p+p . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario has recently been investigated in the random walk approach @xcite    the dependence of the correlation variable @xmath1 vs. the number of participants normalized to the proton proton value is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ phi ] for the urqmd model ( black squares ) while the fritiof calculation is depicted by full diamonds . </S>",
    "<S> the full urqmd simulation yields a dramatic reduction of the particles momentum correlations when going from p+p to a+a ( indicated by _ thermalization? _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the urqmd model belongs to the second of the above discussed models . in contrast , a urqmd calculation with secondary meson - baryon and meson - meson reactions turned off - i.e. only baryon - baryon collisions can occur - yields a @xmath11 ratio of one . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown as the empty square . here </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 value stays compatible with our expectation from the p+p value . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is supported by fritiof calculations ( full diamond ) , which do not include rescattering of secondaries ( see however ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease of the momentum correlation parameter @xmath1 by one order of magnitude when going from p+p to pb+pb ( or by the inclusion of rescattering ) is in line with na49 data @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> does this uncorrelated particle emission indicate global equilibration of the hadronic source ? </S>",
    "<S> it has been recently adressed that in each single event large fluctuations in energy density and isospin happen @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this results in non - thermal initial conditions , which can affect the final state of the single event . </S>",
    "<S> the information is washed out when one averages over many reactions .    in the present model </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be pinned down to be due to the additional mb and mm scattering contributions . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ colldyn ] we have depicted the collision spectra of all particles in central ( b@xmath03  fm ) pb+pb reactions at 160 agev . </S>",
    "<S> overall we find @xmath121200 baryon - baryon , @xmath123400 meson - baryon and @xmath122500 meson - meson collisions : only 17% of all collisions in the pb+pb system are due to baryon+baryon extrapolations in the present model . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the pb(160agev)+pb system reveals a far more complex reaction dynamics than collisions at lower energies or for smaller systems . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to study this correlation ratios for different systems ( s+s , p+a , impact parameter dependence in pb+pb ) and different beam energies to disentangle these contributions . </S>",
    "<S> other quantities should also be introduced to analyse the differences between correlations in p+p and a+a @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the six times larger number of collisions compared to the b+b extrapolation ( or fritiof , resp . ) leads to less correlated momenta of emitted particles . therefore </S>",
    "<S> , a small @xmath1 value is a necessary , but not a sufficient condition for thermal equilibration . </S>",
    "<S> thus , from the present momentum analysis , on should be careful to draw the conclusion that the system has thermalized at late times in the collision .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that heavy ion collisions at 160  agev , exhibit an intricate interplay between all three collision types ( meson - baryon , meson - meson and baryon - baryon ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most important interaction for the @xmath13 distribution is meson - baryon scattering with nearly 50% of all collisions ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to particle momentum correlation patterns in strong contrast to simplified p+p and p+a superpositions / extrapolations . </S>",
    "<S> the present model predicts the small @xmath1 values as measured in pb(160gev)+pb . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to draw the attention of the field to more careful investigation of the hitherto rather unexplored mm and mb reactions . </S>"
