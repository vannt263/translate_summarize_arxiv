    "kaonic atoms as well as scattering of antikaons on nuclei can be used for investigation of antikaon - nucleon interaction .",
    "deuteron is a particularly promising target since dynamics of the few - body @xmath2 system can be properly described by faddeev equations . in our previous paper",
    "@xcite we used the equations for calculations of the @xmath2 scattering length @xmath6 and investigated its dependence on the two - body input . in particular , we were interested in dependence of @xmath6 on phenomenological models of the @xmath7 interaction with one or two poles forming @xmath4 resonance since the question of number of the poles is quite actual ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    in spite of the fact that the most of the `` chirally based '' models of the interaction have two poles , such two - pole structure and energy dependence are not necessary for reproducing experimental data on @xmath5 scattering and kaonic hydrogen .",
    "it was clearly shown in  @xcite , where all the data were described by energy - independent @xmath3 potentials having one- or two - pole structure with equally high accuracy .",
    "it was also demonstrated that no experimental data prove the two - pole structure of the @xmath4 resonance .",
    "however , the scattering length , in contrast to the @xmath0 level shift and width of kaonic deuterium , can not be measured directly .",
    "the task of calculation of the kaonic deuterium characteristics is quite actual in view of siddharta-2 experiment  @xcite , planning measurements of the atom .",
    "mixture of strong and coulomb interactions complicates theoretical investigation of low levels of hadronic atoms using methods of few - body physics . due to this we calculated the energy of the @xmath0 level considering kaonic deuterium as a two - body @xmath1 system . for this purpose a strong @xmath1 potential , reproducing the @xmath2 scattering observables obtained in the advanced calculation , was constructed .",
    "however , additional three - body calculations were necessary to be done before .",
    "first , the potentials used in the calculations in  @xcite reproduce the kek data on the kaonic hydrogen characteristics together with all experimental data on low - energy @xmath5 scattering . keeping in mind the very recent data on kaonic hydrogen measured in the siddharta experiment  @xcite , we constructed the new @xmath3 potentials , which reproduce the newest experimental data , and repeated the calculations of the @xmath2 scattering length .",
    "second , knowledge of the scattering length is not enough for construction of the @xmath1 potential , therefore , we additionally calculated the near - threshold @xmath2 scattering amplitudes for all four models of antikaon - nucleon interaction : used in  @xcite and the new ones .",
    "effective ranges were calculated as well .",
    "finally , the results of the three - body calculations were used for construction of the strong @xmath1 potentials .",
    "the @xmath0 level shifts and widths of kaonic deuterium were then obtained by solving the lippmann - schwinger eigenvalue equation with the constructed strong potentials and directly included coulomb interaction .",
    "an effective two - body @xmath1 potential was used for calculation of level shifts and widths of kaonic deuterium in  @xcite .",
    "the zero - range potential , used in the paper , reproduces a three - body @xmath2 scattering length only .",
    "the first subsection of the next section is devoted to the new @xmath3 potentials , while the rest of the two - body input and the three - body formalism used for the calculations of the near - threshold elastic @xmath2 amplitudes are described in subsection  [ formalism.sect ] .",
    "the obtained @xmath2 scattering lengths and three - body amplitudes are demonstrated and discussed in the last subsection of section  [ kdscattering.sec ] .",

    "the results are shown and discussed in section [ results.sec ] , the last section concludes the article .",
    "all @xmath3 potentials used in our previous work  @xcite for the @xmath2 scattering length calculations reproduce , among other experimental data , the @xmath0 level shift @xmath8 and width @xmath9 of kaonic hydrogen , measured in kek  @xcite : @xmath10 in what follows the two representative potentials from ref .",

    "now , in contrast to the kaonic hydrogen case , our results of the characteristics of kaonic deuterium can not be called `` exact '' . however , the only shortcoming of our approach , which is the supposed structurelessness of the deuteron , is contained in the corrected deser formula as well .",
    "indeed , the only change , which can be made in the original formula for the @xmath5 system for it s usage in the @xmath2 case , is the change of the corresponding reduced mass .",
    "thus , the deuteron structure is not taken into account in the approximate formula .",

    "indeed , the three - body formalisms together with the two - body input , except the main interaction , are the same in all three - body calculations .",
