    "what is the relationship between information and heat ( energy ) ? does a machine that performs calculations ( such as a computer ) have to produce heat ? these questions are purely fundamental but they are also important from a technical point of view .",
    "firstly , as computer users , we want to pay less for the electricity we consume . secondly , the problem of cooling modern electronic systems with high packing density of components is a great challenge for engineers .",
    "the relationship between heat @xmath1 ( and the thermodynamic entropy @xmath2 ) and information had occupied the attention of researchers for a long time before the invention of the computer .",
    "let us recall here the problem of maxwell s demon separating faster particles from the slower which resulted in the flow of heat from a colder to a hotter reservoir .",
    "these considerations led to the suggestion that the measure ( gain of information ) always requires the increase of thermodynamic entropy [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .    according to the present state of knowledge , information processing ( calculations )",
    "may take place without the production of heat . in this case",
    ", we are talking about reversible computations .",
    "the main feature of reversible computations is the ability to recover input data based on output data .",
    "the machine fully capable of implementing this type of task would be a quantum computer [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .",
    "however , the modern digital machine is not reversible .",
    "moreover , apart from the calculations , it must perform other functions ( associated with the calculations ) as well as reading of data , copying of data , etc .. in 1961 , rolf landauer showed in his work [ 5 ] that any logically irreversible manipulation of information , such as erasing the information , must result in an increase in entropy of the apparatus or the environment .",
    "erasing one bit of information should result in the production of heat at the order of @xmath3 .",
    "this is often called the  landauer principle  .",
    "the present paper relates to those considerations , but it does not recalculate the landauer s result using a different method . in our work ,",
    "we consider another ( though related ) issue .",
    "we wonder how much energy should be used to make a copy of one bit useful information when we do not have a pure medium on which we could save a copy , that is , if there is a necessity , to overwrite the original thermal noise appearing on the medium .",
    "therefore , we assume that information is protected against errors due to thermal noise by the presence of additional control symbols ( redundancy ) .",
    "we investigate whether it is better to use a small number of control symbols with a greater energy expenditure per bit ( higher signal to noise ratio ) or the other way round ( ie .",
    "use a large number of control symbols at low signal to noise ratio ) . for this purpose",
    ", we introduce the concept of quantum copier that makes copies of information between subsystems .",
    "the main result of the work ( presented in the last section ) is limitation for the minimum energy required to copy one bit similar to landauer s one .",
    "consider a physical ( quantum ) system that stores one bit of classical information .",
    "let logic state  0  correspond to the quantum state @xmath4 and logic state  1  correspond to the quantum state @xmath5 .",
    "states @xmath4 and @xmath5 are orthogonal to each other ( which ensures their distinguishability in the measurement ) , normalized and form the basis of a quantum system .",
    "let us consider two such systems which will be called @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "next , we construct a quantum operation that copies the states  0  and  1  from the system @xmath6 to system @xmath7 according to the following scheme : @xmath8 where the state @xmath9 means a given state of the system @xmath7 . as we shall see , copy could be done properly only if the system @xmath7 is initially in a particular state , which here is denoted by the abbreviation ",
    "pm  , which stands for  pure medium  .",
    "the choice of states @xmath4 and @xmath5 as basis vectors ( and not as some combination of the basis states ) is only a simplification of the notation does not restrict the generality of our considerations .    in order to fully determine the unitary operation acting on subsystems @xmath6 and @xmath7 we have to introduce vector @xmath10 ( from the words  unprepared medium  ) orthogonal to @xmath9 and determine the action of the operation on it . if we did it as follows , and @xmath7 ) .",
    "states @xmath11 will be denoted by @xmath12 or even @xmath13 . ] : @xmath14 then our operation would be able to copy the initial state of subsystem @xmath6 to subsystem @xmath7 , regardless of the initial state of medium @xmath7 . unfortunately , this type of operation is not unitary .",
    "this would be an irreversible process erasing information about the initial state of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , we have to design our system as follows : @xmath15 this means that for copying operation ( which will be called the quantum copier ) to work correctly , the second entry must always be in the state @xmath16 .",
    "otherwise errors will occur .",
    "equations ( 1)-(4 ) fully define the operation of the copier as a unitary operation acting over @xmath17 .",
    "let us emphasize that the copier can copy only the base states ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , not their superpositions .",
    "copying of any state is impossible by the no - cloning theorem .",
    "let us examine what the result of copying will be when the medium @xmath7 is initially unprepared .",
    "for this purpose , we choose the initial state of @xmath7 as a mixed state in the form : @xmath20 where @xmath21 can be identified with a probability of incorrect preparation of the medium ( and therefore erroneous copying ) .    in the case of @xmath6",
    ", we assume that with probability @xmath22 the system stores a  0  , and with probability of @xmath23 it stores a  1  .",
    "therefore , we assign the system @xmath6 a mixed state in the following form : @xmath24    subsystems @xmath6 and @xmath7 are together in a state which can be written as : @xmath25    after copying information ( after applying the unitary operation @xmath26 described by the equations ( 1)-(4 ) ) we obtain : @xmath27 + \\\\+ p_1\\vert1\\rangle\\langle1\\vert_a[(1-b)\\vert1\\rangle\\langle1\\vert_b+b\\vert0\\rangle\\langle0\\vert_b]\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and after counting the partial trace : @xmath28\\vert0\\rangle\\langle0\\vert+[p_0b+p_1(1-b)]\\vert1\\rangle\\langle1\\vert\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us look at specific cases : @xmath29    thus , we have obtained what we expected . for @xmath30",
    "we obtain a faithful copy , for @xmath31 we obtain a complete lack of information copied from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , for @xmath32 we get a faithful copy with negation ( the states @xmath9 and @xmath10 turn its roles ) .",
    "we will treat states of @xmath6 (  0  and  1  ) as the realization of a stochastic process @xmath33 and states of @xmath7 ( after copying ) as the realization of stochastic process @xmath34 .",
    "the relationship between these two processes can be depicted by the graph in figure  1 .     and @xmath34 . the @xmath35 and @xmath36 - probability of correct transmission , @xmath37 , @xmath38 - probability of erroneous transmission , width=170 ]    it is a complete analogy with the shannon s , binary , noisy information channel .",
    "the process @xmath33 correspond to the process at the entrance to the channel , the process @xmath34 in the output .    in the next step ,",
    "we calculate transinformtion @xmath39 for these processes ( i.e. the amount of knowledge about @xmath33 which is contained in @xmath34 ) : @xmath40 where the probabilities for the process @xmath33 are given by : @xmath41 while for the process @xmath34 are in the form : @xmath42 while the total probabilities : @xmath43    let us calculate transinformation ( [ eq_shannon ] ) for the case @xmath44 , since then in @xmath6 , we have exactly the 1bit of information .",
    "then : @xmath45",
    "for simplicity , we assume that @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in addition , we assume that they are stationary states of the free hamiltonian of @xmath7 .",
    "otherwise , these states would evolve in time and reading of information ( stored in them ) at any moment of time would be difficult . thus , let @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote energy of state @xmath50 and energy of the @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "our main assumption is that before copying the system @xmath7 was in contact with the thermostat at a temperature of @xmath0 long enough to reach thermodynamic equilibrium . in practice , this is a natural assumption , since any real device works at a temperature different from the absolute zero .",
    "probability of filling the levels @xmath4 and @xmath5 at temperature @xmath0 are respectively given by : @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath54 only for @xmath55 . for @xmath56 error rate",
    "@xmath21 is very low , while for @xmath57 error rate @xmath21 tends to @xmath58 .",
    "the most important conclusion is that medium @xmath7 in thermal equilibrium is useful for copying if the energies of the levels differ ( ie .",
    "@xmath59 ) . otherwise , @xmath60 and ( under considerations presented in section 3 ) the medium is totally useless .",
    "in order to copy useful information , when @xmath61 , we have to protect transmission against possible errors . to this end , we must encode useful information by adding a certain amount of control symbols .",
    "let us denote the number of all symbols by @xmath62 ( one symbol carrying one bit of useful information and @xmath63 symbols are control symbols ) .",
    "in practice , we should have not only one system @xmath6 but the whole series of systems in an amount of @xmath62 .",
    "we also need @xmath62 systems @xmath7 in the states corresponding to a temperature of @xmath0 , where we finally put ",
    "copies from systems @xmath6 .    according to the shannon theorem [ 6 ]",
    ", we can conclude that for transfer of one bit of useful information , @xmath64 bits are necessary , where @xmath39 is given by formula ( [ eq_inofs ] ) .",
    "we do not examine here any specific coding procedure ( the values that control bits must take are not defined ) .",
    "let us calculate the energy that must be used to copy @xmath62 symbols from systems @xmath6 to systems @xmath7 .",
    "it is calculated as follows : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the average energy of @xmath7 before copying ( i.e. , at a temperature of @xmath0 ) calculated for @xmath67 and @xmath55 .",
    "energy @xmath68 is the average energy of @xmath7 after copying .",
    "we assume here that the probabilities of occurrence of zeros and ones in the @xmath7 are equal and amount to 1/2 .. in addition , we assume that among the control symbols added before copying is the same number of  0  and  1  .",
    "this type of code are usually the most optimal . during copying from @xmath6 to @xmath7 probability of distortion from",
    " 0  to  1  and from  1  to  0  are the same ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this results in conservation of symmetry between the zeros and ones on the @xmath7 . ]",
    "this gives the energy ( [ eq_q1b ] ) equal to : @xmath69 where @xmath21 is given by eq .",
    "( 17 ) .",
    "energy ( [ eq_q2b ] ) is an increasing function of @xmath70 .",
    "this means that it is less expensive to encode the information at low signal to noise ratio with a large amount of control symbols @xmath62 . in the borderline case ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath71     for @xmath72 .",
    "the straight line ( added for comparison ) corresponds to the value @xmath73.,width=188 ]    energy ( [ eq_q2b ] ) does not correspond to the scattered heat ( as in landauer ) .",
    "our copy machine works reversibly .",
    "the copy obtained in the @xmath7 still contains information about the state of medium @xmath7 before copying .",
    "this information can be recovered by comparing the `` dirty '' copy with original one saved on @xmath6 .",
    "thus , there is no erasure of information .",
    "erasure may occur in the next phase - on machine decoding and removing copying errors .",
