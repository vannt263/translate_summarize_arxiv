    "the rotational transitions of carbon monoxide ( co ) are the most important probes used to trace the density and velocity structure of molecular clouds . due to the low electric dipole moment of the co molecule , the j = ( 10 ) and ( 21 )",
    "transitions are easily excited into emission in molecular clouds with modest extinctions ( @xmath7 magnitude ) .",
    "because of this and the fact that the frequencies of the ( 10 ) and ( 21 ) transitions lie in two relatively transparent atmospheric windows , they are the most commonly observed molecular emission lines in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "unfortunately the information given by observing these transitions is limited , since they are not sensitive to volume densities above the critical density for collisional excitation , @xmath8 . to probe gas at higher density demands that transitions with higher energies be observed .",
    "star - formation regions are bright in the high - j co transitions , but modelling these transitions is difficult because ( 1 ) the large co column density in such regions renders their interiors completely opaque , and ( 2 ) randomly distributed energy sources ( stars ) increase dramatically the complexity of the problem .",
    "modelling success is more likely in regions which are relatively optically thin and far from star formation .",
    "the simplest class of molecular cloud observable in co is the translucent cloud ( van dishoeck & black 1988 ) .",
    "translucent clouds have modest visual extinctions ( @xmath9mag ) , and therefore are intermediate between low - extinction diffuse clouds , which contain few molecules observable in emission , and optically thick dark clouds . the high galactic latitude ( @xmath10 ) molecular clouds ( hlcs",
    "; see review by magnani , hartmann , & speck 1996 , and references therein ) are a set of nearby ( @xmath11 ; magnani  1996 ) translucent clouds associated with _",
    "iras _ cirrus ( low  1984 ) .",
    "the hlcs are generally far from sources of far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) ( 6ev @xmath12 13.6ev ) radiation and most are probably exposed to the average interstellar fuv radiation field ( see van dishoeck & black 1988 ; draine 1978 ; habing 1968 ) .",
    "latitude clouds are photochemically and energetically the simplest molecular objects in the ism .",
    "they have equal amounts of carbon gas in atomic form , , as in co , with an average c / co column density ratio of @xmath13 ( stark & van dishoeck 1994 ; ingalls , bania , & jackson 1994 ; ingalls ,  1997 ) .",
    "they are essentially isolated photodissociation regions ( tielens & hollenbach 1985 ) whose structure is dominated by the transition from atomic to molecular gas which occurs on the surface of all molecular clouds .",
    "most hlcs are uncomplicated by internal energy sources .",
    "some of the hlcs contain t tauri stars ( magnani , caillault , buchalter , & beichman 1995 ; pound 1996 ) and others have marginally bound dense cores ( reach  1995 ) , but on the whole hlcs are minimally affected by stars .",
    "thus they are the most basic clouds observable in co emission and are ideal candidates for multi - transition co studies .",
    "the most comprehensive study of co in translucent and high  latitude clouds was done by van dishoeck , black , phillips , & gredel ( 1991 ) .",
    "they observed 4 transitions of  and  in a sample of @xmath14 clouds .",
    "they derived relatively low gas volume densities ( @xmath15 ) and high kinetic temperatures ( @xmath16 ) , but they warned that their data are also compatible with higher densities and lower temperatures .",
    "an ongoing investigation of the physics and chemistry of translucent clouds ( turner 1994 ; see also turner , terzieva , & herbst 1999 and references therein ) supports the low density , high temperature conclusion . on the other hand , a study of co emission towards the translucent edge of a cloud in the perseus  auriga complex ( falgarone & phillips 1996 , hereafter fp ) claimed that the co emission is produced by beam  diluted clumps with high densities ( @xmath17 ) and low temperatures ( @xmath18 )",
    "( see also falgarone , phillips , & walker 1991 ) .",
    "interestingly , fp admitted that the observations could also be produced by a more homogeneous co medium with lower densities ( @xmath19 ) and higher temperatures ( @xmath20 )",
    ".    in general the solution of the statistical equilibrium equations rests on an assumption about either the kinetic temperature or the cloud geometry ( van dishoeck  1991 )",
    ". clearly such solutions are not unique , since collisional excitation rates are affected by both temperature and density .",
    "observations of the rotational transitions of high dipole - moment molecules in translucent and high  latitude clouds ( reach , pound , wilner & lee 1995 ; heithausen , corneilussen , & grossman 1998 ) support the assertion made by fp that significant quantities of dense gas exist , but they do not prove that most of the co emission originates in such gas .",
    "even the high - density conclusions of reach ( 1995 ) , and heithausen  ( 1998 ) rely on assumed low  values ( 520 ) .",
    "the co emission towards translucent clouds shows some surprising regularities which should be exploited in a multitransition study .",
    "for example , the  ( 21 ) intensity is linearly proportional to the ( 10 ) intensity in clouds without star formation , for all positions and velocities observed ( fp ; falgarone  1998 ) .",
    "this important fact implies that the excitation conditions which lead to emission in these transitions are uniform throughout the clouds .",
    "fp argued that the simplest situation which would produce uniform excitation conditions was the high density , low temperature ( hdlt ) one ( @xmath21 ) , since the co level populations would be thermal under these conditions .",
    "they eliminated the low density , high temperature ( ldht ) case ( @xmath22 ) because the implied line - of - sight structure sizes ( column density divided by volume density ) are greater than the @xmath23  size of the smallest structure observed in projection on the plane of the sky .",
    "implicit in their argument is the assumption that the size of a structure along the line - of - sight equals ( on average ) the size of the smallest observed structure in the plane of the sky .",
    "this may not be strictly true .",
    "the best direct evidence for the existence of tiny co clumps in translucent clouds is the population of unresolved @xmath24au ( 0.01  ) sized structures seen in velocity channel maps of the first _",
    "key - project ( falgarone  1998 ) .",
    "these dense unresolved cores are not isolated spheres , however , but usually have the shape of elongated filaments which are unresolved in one direction only .",
    "thus there is little reason to suppose that the average line of sight size of co emission cells equals the smallest observed plane - of - sky structure size .    given this geometrical uncertainty ,",
    "data for many transitions are needed to decide if the primary source of co emission is gas with ldht or hdlt conditions . in particular , higher energy transitions of co",
    "should be observed towards translucent clouds .",
    "although they observed the ( 43 ) transition of  towards some positions in the cloud they studied , fp were not able to determine if excitation of this transition was uniform , as it was for the ( 10 ) and ( 21 ) transitions .",
    "if the co level populations are thermal , then the discovery of uniform j = 4 excitation might support their claim of the ubiquity of gas with @xmath25 , since the critical density for thermal excitation of the ( 43 ) transition is @xmath26 .",
    "in this paper we report observations of the j = ( 43 ) rotational transition of  towards a sample of 8 translucent high  latitude molecular clouds at southern declinations (  2 and  3 ) .",
    "our new data are used in conjunction with the  and  observations made by van dishoeck  ( 1991 ) to constrain the physical conditions in the hlc regions emitting co radiation (  4 ) .",
    "we show that the emission from _ all _ co transitions up to ( 43 ) is linearly correlated ,  the excitation is uniform .",
    "we use a statistical argument to demonstrate that inclusion of our new ( 43 ) data narrows significantly the allowed region of parameter space , making the hdlt solution the most likely one .",
    "we discuss the physical implications of gas with hdlt properties , particularly thermal pressure imbalance with the ambient interstellar medium (  5 ) .",
    "finally we suggest a method to test for the existence of hdlt gas .",
    "eight hlcs at southern declinations were observed ( see table 1 for galactic identifications ) .",
    "seven of the clouds were listed in the catalog of keto & myers ( 1986 ) .",
    "the observed source positions are listed in ingalls  ( 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , a previously unknown translucent high  latitude cloud , g259.413.3 [ @xmath27 , was observed .",
    "this cloud was discovered during a search made towards _ iras _",
    "cirrus clouds for new  ( 21 ) sources ( ingalls 1999 ) .",
    "the observations described here were part of a study of the overall gas - phase carbon content in translucent clouds ( ingalls , bania , & jackson 1994 ; ingalls  1997 ; ingalls 1999 ) .",
    "the seven clouds from the keto & myers ( 1986 ) catalog were each recently detected in neutral atomic carbon [ ] emission by ingalls  ( 1997 ) . prior to this , most of the clouds had only been observed in co at 87 angular resolution ( keto & myers 1986 ) .",
    "cloud g225.366.3 , has also been observed at higher resolution in co emission and in the photographic _ b _ band by stark ( 1995 ) .",
    "cloud g316.5 + 21.0 has a low mass star embedded in it ( ingalls  1997 ) .",
    "since this cloud has its own internal energy source it may be hotter and more dense than the typical hlc .",
    "a comparison with the more quiescent clouds in the sample may provide insight into the effects of low mass star formation on translucent gas .",
    "observations of the 461.041 ghz ( j = 43 ) transition of  were made during the period 1997 june 29 through july 13 , using the antarctic submillimeter telescope and remote observatory ( ast / ro ) .",
    "ast / ro is a 1.7 m diameter telescope located at the national science foundation amundsen - scott south pole station ( stark  1997 ) .",
    "the telescope efficiency at 461 ghz was estimated from skydip measurements ( chamberlin , lane , & stark 1997 ) to be @xmath28 .",
    "as mentioned by ingalls ( 1997 ) , @xmath29 is close to the main - beam efficiency , @xmath30 .",
    "the 461 ghz transition was measured using the ast / ro 492/810 sis waveguide receiver which had a @xmath31 double sideband receiver noise temperature .",
    "the intermediate frequency output was sampled by a 2048 channel , 1.4 ghz bandwidth acousto - optical spectrometer ( aos ) ( schieder , tolls , & winnewisser 1989 ) .",
    "the velocity resolution was @xmath32v@xmath33 .",
    "system noise temperatures were of order 18003000 .",
    "the half power beam width of the ast / ro telescope at 461 ghz was approximately 180 .",
    "observations of the 230.538 ghz ( j = 21 ) transition of  were made in 1996 november using the ast / ro 230 ghz sis receiver which had a double sideband noise temperature of @xmath34 .",
    "based on measurements of @xmath29 from skydips ( see above ) , the value @xmath35 was adopted for 230 ghz .",
    "the same aos used for the ( 43 ) measurements was used for the ( 21 ) data , yielding a velocity resolution of @xmath32v@xmath36 .",
    "the system noise temperature at 230 ghz was @xmath37 .",
    "the beamsize of the ast / ro telescope at 230 ghz is @xmath38 .",
    "the  ( 43 ) and ( 21 ) observations were obtained by position - switching 1  in azimuth .",
    "because of the location of ast / ro , position - switched offsets were both at constant elevation and at fixed positions on the sky .",
    "intensity calibration was accomplished by measuring two blackbody loads at known temperatures ( stark  1997 ) . in order to correct for atmospheric attenuation",
    "the sky brightness temperature was measured at the position of a source every @xmath39 minutes .",
    "the overall intensity calibration was checked by observing periodically the compact  region g291.20.8 .",
    "this procedure yielded intensities repeatable to within @xmath40 at both 230 ghz and 461 ghz .",
    "the hlc g272.9 + 29.3 was observed with the five college radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) , in amherst ma , on 1996 february 17 through 18 .",
    "the fcrao 14 m telescope was used to map the   ( 10 ) transition at 115.2712 ghz .",
    "the telescope has a beamsize of 45  and a 115 ghz main beam efficiency of @xmath41 at 20  elevation ( ladd & heyer 1996 ) .",
    "the observations were carried out in frequency  switched mode , with the signal and reference spectra spaced 4.5 mhz apart .",
    "the spectra were measured with the quarry focal plane array receiver ( erickson  1992 ) , and the data were sampled by an array of 15 autocorrelation spectrometers with 1024 channels , separated by 77 khz per channel , giving a velocity resolution of @xmath32v@xmath42 . since the source is a southern hemisphere object with declination @xmath43 , its elevation was rather low , ranging from 16  to 19 .",
    "the single  sideband system noise temperature was approximately 2000 k for these observations .",
    "observed  ( 43 ) and ( 21 ) spectra are plotted alongside maps of each source in figures [ hlc1_2 ] to [ hlc7_8 ] .",
    "the ( 43 ) transition was detected towards 7 of 8 clouds observed .",
    "the  ( 43 ) hlc data consist of half - beam sampled measurements made on a @xmath44 grid , in a manner similar to the  `` superbeam '' observations described by ingalls  ( 1997 ) .",
    "these maps were averaged over the @xmath45square grids to produce the spectra shown in figures [ hlc1_2 ] to [ hlc7_8 ] .",
    "the  `` superbeam '' average spectra taken towards the same positions ( ingalls  1997 ) are also displayed in the figures .",
    "intensities are main - beam brightness temperatures , ,  rayleigh - jeans antenna temperature , @xmath46 , corrected for both atmospheric attenuation and main - beam efficiency ( @xmath47 ) .    each source was observed in  ( 21 ) emission at its nominal center with the @xmath38 ast / ro beam . for seven of the sources , these spectra are part of  @xmath48 half - beam sampled maps , shown as black contours overlaid on _ iras _",
    "100@xmath49 m greyscale images in figures [ hlc1_2 ] to [ hlc7_8 ] .",

    "the calibration uncertainty for the hires images is of order 20% .",
    "gaussian fits were made to the co ( 43 ) and ( 21 ) spectra and are shown superimposed on these spectra in figures [ hlc1_2 ] to [ hlc7_8 ] .",
    "table 1 lists the line center velocity , , and the peak intensity , , from the gaussian fits .",
    "also listed is the integrated line intensity , @xmath51 .",
    "error bars for both transitions were determined by adding in quadrature the instrumental noise ( ) and a calibration uncertainty of 15% : @xmath52 gaussian fit linewidths , @xmath53 , range from 0.9 to 3  with an average of @xmath54 , slightly greater than the velocity resolution of the ( 21 ) observations , so the lines are only marginally resolved . for this reason both  and @xmath53 are poorly - determined .",
    "we will therefore focus our attention on the integrated intensity , @xmath51 , which is a better defined quantity . since ( 43 )",
    "radiation was not detected towards g272.9 + 29.3 , we estimate a 3@xmath55 upper limit to the ( 43 ) integrated intensity for this source using the average linewidth : @xmath56 .      the ( 10 ) transition of  was mapped in source g272.9 + 29.3 at 45  angular resolution .",
    "the map consisted of a @xmath57 grid of pixels , evenly spaced at @xmath58 , one - half the fcrao beamwidth .",
    "the resulting map of  ( 10 ) integrated intensity is superimposed as white contours on figure [ hlc7_8 ] ( _ a _ ) .",
    "the average spectrum in a @xmath45 `` superbeam '' at the nominal source center is plotted on the right side of this figure .",
    "this spectrum was resolved in velocity by the fcrao spectrometer : a gaussian fit gives the line center velocity @xmath59 , linewidth @xmath60 and peak intensity @xmath61 .",
    "the hlcs are the average galactic high  latitude sources of co emission .",
    "this can be shown in two ways .",
    "first , we can use the all - sky co survey done with the far infrared absolute spectrometer ( firas ) instrument on board the _ cosmic background explorer _ ( _ cobe _ ) satellite .",
    "this instrument was used to observe nearly the entire sky at 7  resolution in the first six transitions of  ( wright  1991 ; bennett  1994 ) .",
    "the data are available on the world wide web . the average value of the _ cobe _ firas high - latitude ( @xmath62 ) ( 43)/(21 ) integrated intensity ratio is @xmath63 .",
    "the intensities were reported in units of erg@xmath64 .",
    "the firas integrated intensity ratio may be compared with the ratio of integrated rayleigh - jeans brightness temperatures measured here for hlcs if one uses the conversion formula : @xmath65 the function @xmath66 : @xmath67 and @xmath68erg@xmath69 .",
    "the average hlc value measured here is [ equation [ co_fit ] , multiplied by @xmath70 @xmath71 , which is nearly identical to the _ cobe _ average .",
    "the infrared properties of the hlcs studied here can also be compared with the average properties of interstellar cirrus clouds .",
    "hires - processed images of both 60 and 100  emission observed with _",
    "iras _ were obtained for each cloud in the sample .",
    "the 60  surface brightness , , is plotted as a function of the 100  surface brightness , , in figure [ iras ] . both the 60 and 100  measurements are averages over the 5``superbeam '' centered on each source , described in  3.1 .",
    "the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) on board the _ cobe _ satellite was used to observe the infrared spectrum of the entire galaxy .",
    "the average result for all milky way gas correlated with  emission , @xmath72 , was derived by dwek  ( 1997 ) .",
    "this is the same as the mean value for the hlcs studied here , @xmath73 ( the authors did not quote an error for this ratio ) . a straight line indicating @xmath74 is superimposed on figure [ iras ] .",
    "notice that most of the clouds fall on this line , with the exception of source g316.5 + 21.0 which has @xmath75 .",
    "for this cloud @xmath76 , which is much larger than that of the other clouds in the sample .",
    "this implies that g316.5 + 21.0 has a greater relative abundance of the `` very small grains '' which produce most of the 60   emission (  dsert , boulanger , & puget 1990 ) .",
    "the low mass star which is embedded in the source must be responsible for this , presumably by heating the dust in excess of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) and evaporating the mantles of larger grains which produce 100  emission .",
    "here we give evidence for uniform co excitation in translucent clouds .",
    "figure [ colines_1 ] shows the observed ( 43 ) and ( 21 ) integrated intensities for the hlc sample , plotted as a function of .",
    "both graphs in figure [ colines_1 ] show the same behavior , although the trend is not necessarily monotonic .",
    "figure [ colines_2 ] is a plot of @xmath77 as a function of @xmath78 .",
    "the ( 43 ) integrated intensity is linearly correlated with the ( 21 ) integrated intensity .",
    "the correspondence is significant , with a correlation coefficient of @xmath79 .",
    "linear regression to the data , weighted by the errors , gives : @xmath80 a line representing equation [ co_fit ] is superimposed on the data in figure [ colines_2 ] .",
    "the @xmath81intercept was held fixed at zero ,  we have assumed that there is no ( 43 ) emission when there is no ( 21 ) emission , and vice  versa .",
    "source g316.5 + 21.0 has an anomalously high ( 43)/(21 ) integrated intensity ratio .",
    "as explained in  3.3 , the star embedded in this cloud is likely to make the gas hotter than in the average translucent cloud , whence high level co transitions will be excited more readily into emission .",
    "since the linear fit to the ( 43 ) and ( 21 ) data was weighted by the errors , this source ( which had rather large error bars ) did not contribute significantly to the fit .",
    "the linear relationship between @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( figure [ colines_2 ] ) is reminiscent of the correlation between the  ( 21 ) and ( 10 ) brightness temperatures seen towards `` pre - star - forming regions '' by falgarone  ( 1998 ) .",
    "there is nothing special about the hlc positions we observed ; they are the nominal `` cloud center '' positions ( keto & myers 1986 ; ingalls 1999 ) , and do not necessarily coincide with the peak of co emission . recall that all quantities quoted in table 1 refer to measurements in a 5   circle ( see figures [ hlc1_2 ] to [ hlc7_8 ] ) made towards these centers .",
    "these nominal positions have 100  surface brightnesses ranging over 2 orders of magnitude , so the sample is obviously not homogeneous . nevertheless , the ratio between the ( 43 ) and ( 21 ) integrated intensities , as well as between the 60 and 100  intensities , is remarkably uniform .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that _ the co emission from all translucent clouds originates from gas with the same physical conditions _",
    ", even though different lines of sight contain different amounts of such gas .",
    "this was the conclusion of falgarone  ( 1991 ) and fp , based on their study of the edge of a cloud in the perseus complex .",
    "a linear correlation seems to exist between _ all _ pairs of co transitions observed towards hlcs .",
    "the most extensive database of co observations of hlcs is that of van dishoeck  ( 1991 ) .",
    "figure [ cofits ] shows @xmath83 ( _ top _ ) and @xmath84 ( _ bottom _ ) plotted as a function of @xmath82 for the @xmath14 translucent and/or high  latitude positions detected by van dishoeck  ( 1991 ; their table 7 ) .",
    "both the @xmath83 vs. @xmath82 and the @xmath84 vs. @xmath82 datasets have a highly significant correlation ( @xmath85 for each dataset ) , of which van dishoeck  ( 1991 ) were apparently unaware .",
    "linear regression to the data gives the following fits : @xmath86 @xmath87 as for equation [ co_fit ] , the fits were constrained to have an intercept value of zero .",
    "we weighted the data using 30% error bars , corresponding to the overall calibration uncertainty quoted by van dishoeck  ( 1991 ) .",
    "this correlation also applies to the cloud sample used by turner ( 1993 ) . for turner s translucent cloud sample , the average  ( 10)/(21 )",
    "integrated intensity ratio for nine sources is @xmath88 , which is indistinguishable ( within the errors ) from the result given above .",
    "the slope in equation [ co_fit_b ] is equivalent to the constant ( 21)/(10 ) brightness temperature ratio observed by falgarone  ( 1998 ) .",
    "considering each spectral channel individually , they measured @xmath89 for 80% of the data points in their maps made towards three translucent clouds . in comparison ,",
    "the reciprocal of the equation [ co_fit_b ] slope is @xmath90 .",
    "note that falgarone  ( 1998 ) and fp did not study isolated translucent objects , but since they obtained similar values for @xmath91 it is possible that the linear relationship is also a characteristic of the _ translucent edges _ of non - starforming dark clouds .",
    "this result is not limited to translucent regions .",
    "a large scale survey of the milky way molecular ring has obtained an average value of the ( 21)/(10 ) ratio of @xmath92 with a median of 0.69 ( chiar , kutner , verter , & leous 1994 ) .",
    "similarly , the mean value for the entire galactic plane , @xmath93 , was derived by sanders  ( 1993 ; also see sanders  1986 ) , and handa  ( 1993 ) measured a mean ratio of 0.7 for the galactic molecular ring ( also see dame  1986 ) .",
    "thus essentially all surveys of co consistently show a linear correlation between ( 21 ) and ( 10 ) integrated emission .",
    "this correlation also exists for the co peak brightness temperature .",
    "peak brightness temperatures were listed by van dishoeck  ( 1991 ) for the translucent sources with spectrally resolved ( 10 ) , ( 21 ) , and ( 32 ) line profiles .",
    "we find that these are also correlated , and linear fits give the same slopes as the integrated intensity fits . in general , for any two of these transitions , `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' , @xmath94",
    "this is a trivial statement for gaussian line profiles but according to van dishoeck  ( 1991 ) not all of their spectra were well - described by a gaussian shape . therefore , linear correlation of integrated intensities is not solely due to a correlation in _ linewidths _ which might occur in optically thick gravitationally bound systems with different masses .",
    "we make one last comparison , that between the integrated intensities of the ( 10 ) transition of the  and  isotopomers .",
    "the data are listed in table 7 of van dishoeck  ( 1991 ) and plotted here in figure [ cofits_b ] . for these data the correlation coefficient , @xmath95 , so there is only an 80% chance that the data are correlated ( taylor 1997 ) .",
    "linear regression ( with zero intercept ) yields : @xmath96 the fit is not very robust , but the slope 0.13@xmath970.03 gives a good estimate of the average /  intensity ratio .",
    "( we obtain a comparable value for this ratio using the  and  hlc data of keto & myers 1986 ) .",
    "this is approximately five times higher than what is expected if the co - emitting regions are optically thin to both  and  radiation , assuming the abundance ratio @xmath98/[^{13}{\\rm c}]= 60 $ ] ( boreiko & betz 1996 ; langer & penzias 1993 ) . taking into account isotope - selective photodissociation and chemical fractionation , the slope from optically thin gas should range from @xmath99 to 0.028 ( van dishoeck & black 1988 ) .",
    "nearly all of the data points fall above the line @xmath100 which is superimposed on figure [ cofits_b ] , so we conclude that most of the co - emitting regions in hlcs are optically thick to  ( 10 ) radiation .",
    "we have shown that the co integrated intensities @xmath83 , @xmath82 , @xmath84 , and @xmath81 are related linearly for a large sample of translucent high  latitude molecular clouds .",
    "unfortunately the cloud sample used by van dishoeck  ( 1991 ) does not overlap with our own sample , so it is uncertain whether all of the clouds in both samples fulfil all of the linear relationships .",
    "this is probably true , however , since both samples probe the same kind of gas . by definition ,",
    "all of the clouds are translucent (  @xmath101 , no internal uv sources ; see ingalls  1997 ) .",
    "in addition , they have similar  ( 21 ) and 100  emission properties .",
    "for example , the weighted mean @xmath102 ratio for our sample is @xmath103 .",
    "for the cloud towards hd 210121 , towards which van dishoeck  ( 1991 ) observed six positions , the average @xmath102 ratio is @xmath104 .",
    "it is therefore likely that the clouds in both samples are equivalent .",
    "indeed , falgarone  ( 1998 ) cite the linear relationship between intensities of co rotational transitions as a general characteristic of `` clouds of low average column density '' ,  translucent clouds ( see also clemens & barvainis 1988 ; falgarone  1991 ; falgarone , puget , & prault 1992 ; fp ) .    in what follows we interpret the slopes of the linear fits ( equations [ co_fit ] , [ co_fit_b ] , [ co_fit_c ] , and [ co_fit_13 ] ) to be the true ( constant ) values of the respective integrated intensity ratios in the cells which emit co radiation .",
    "we take the co - emitting cells to be nearly identical structures which are separated from each other in position and/or radial velocity . in this model",
    "an increase in the integrated intensity of a co transition is attributed solely to an increase in the number of cells being observed ,  an increase in @xmath105 , the beam filling fraction of the co radiation emitting from a particular direction at a specific velocity .",
    "here we introduce a statistical method for modelling the physical conditions in the co - emitting cells of translucent molecular clouds .",
    "as stated above , integrated intensity ratios among the first four transitions of co are constant .",
    "define the following integrated intensity ratios for translucent clouds : @xmath106}{i[^{12}{\\rm co}(1 - 0)]}\\equiv ( r_4\\pm \\sigma_4 ) & = & 0.13\\pm 0.04\\label{r4}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these ratios are taken from equations [ co_fit ] , [ co_fit_b ] , [ co_fit_c ] , and [ co_fit_13 ] .",
    "suppose that fluctuations in the @xmath107th ratio , @xmath108 , are distributed normally with mean @xmath109 and standard deviation @xmath110 .",
    "the probability of measuring the @xmath107th ratio to be between @xmath108 and @xmath111 is then : @xmath112 since the ratios are constant ( excluding fluctuations ) , they are statistically independent of each other . the joint probability of observing a given set of ratios is thus given by the product :",
    "@xmath113    this analysis requires that all the co emission originates in gas with the same physical conditions .",
    "we of course have argued that this is the case ( see  3.4 ) .",
    "therefore , given a physical model and an input grid of physical parameters , the line intensities , , and ratios among them , @xmath114 , can be computed .",
    "equation [ prob_dist ] gives the probability distribution in the vector of ratios , * r*. this can be used to estimate the most likely portion of the input parameter space which gives the observed ratios .",
    "below we evaluate the high density , low temperature ( hdlt ) and the low density , high temperature ( ldht ) translucent cloud scenarios using two simple cloud models , the local thermodynamic equilibrium model and the large velocity gradient model .      in the hdlt scenario advocated by fp the co emission originates in cold , high - density regions where the co level populations are in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "this scenario is worth investigating because of its extreme simplicity  in lte the line ratios depend on only two parameters , the excitation temperature , , and the co column density per velocity interval , .",

    "the function @xmath105 contains the details of the telescope beam average ; if the emission originates from gas with uniform properties , then @xmath105 is simply the beam filling fraction of the gas . in this case , which we assume to hold for hlcs , @xmath105 cancels when line ratios are taken .",
    "we will use the lte model to predict  ratios , and then compare them directly with the observed @xmath120 ratios ( equation [ tmb_tint ] ) by assuming gaussian line profiles .",

    "the  intensities were determined in the same way as the  intensities , except the  abundance was taken to be 1/60 that of .",
    "predicted  lte line ratios are listed in table 2 as a function of excitation temperature for @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the bottom row of the table gives the actual values observed towards hlcs .",
    "the measured ( 21)/(10 ) , ( 32)/(21 ) , and ( 43)/(21 ) ratios are all compatible with low temperatures , @xmath128 . using the probability distribution function , @xmath129 ( equation [ prob_dist ] ) , we can determine quantitatively a probability distribution in ( ,  ) space .",
    "figure [ cloud_lte ] shows this . the dashed contour on the figure represents the 1@xmath55 confidence interval ( 68.3% of the total probability ) in the ( ,  ) plane when only ratios 1 , 2 , and 4 are considered ,  when we neglect the new ( 43 ) data ( this paper ) . the solid shaded contour represents the 1@xmath55 confidence interval",
    "when the new data are included , and the two surrounding solid contours represent the 2 and 3@xmath55 confidence intervals ( 95.4% and 99.7% , respectively , of the total probability ) .",
    "the new data have decreased the size of the 1@xmath55 contour by a factor of @xmath130 .",
    "the most probable set of physical properties is : @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "evidently , if co - emitting regions are in lte then the temperature is low , and the hdlt regime is the only solution .",
    "the lte line center opacity ( equation [ tau_lte ] ) is @xmath133 9.6 , 7.2 , 2.1 , and 0.3 , for the  ( 10 ) , ( 21 ) , ( 32 ) , and ( 43 ) transitions respectively . as we deduced from the observations ( see figure [ cofits_b ] ) , the co - emitting regions are optically thick to  ( 10 ) radiation . in fact , only the ( 43 ) and higher transitions of  are optically thin .",
    "the lte analysis is necessary but not sufficient to confirm the hdlt scenario because the lte model does not consider the possibility of low density gas .",
    "we have simply shown that if the gas is dense enough such that the transitions are thermalized , then the temperature must be low .",
    "there is no reason _ a priori _ to believe this is true .",
    "if the temperature is high enough , intermediate levels such as @xmath134 may be significantly populated even in low density gas .",
    "furthermore , it may be radiative trapping which causes the thermalization of level populations , rather than high densities .",
    "the lte model can not distinguish between such possibilities .    in this section",
    "we calculate the co level populations in statistical equilibrium using the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) formalism ( sobolev 1960 ; castor 1971 ) .",
    "this approximation states that the mean free path of spectral line photons , @xmath135 , is on average much less than the product @xmath136 , where @xmath53 is the total cloud velocity dispersion and @xmath137 is the cloud velocity gradient which is a systematic function of position . in the lvg approximation different regions in a cloud are effectively decoupled in velocity space , whence line radiation emitted from one region of the cloud does not interact with any other region .",
    "this simplifies considerably the radiative transfer computation .",
    "of course , the lvg approximation does not strictly hold in hlcs  it is unlikely that the velocity field in hlcs is so well - ordered as to produce a systematic velocity gradient .",
    "in general the clouds are not gravitationally bound ( mbm ; keto & myers 1986 ; pound & blitz 1993 ; heithausen 1996 ) , nor do they possess evidence of large  scale outflows or rotation (  pound  1991 ) .",
    "instead , the velocity field in these clouds is most likely turbulent ( falgarone 1994 ; falgarone  1994 ) , hence the velocity is a random function of position .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath135 is probably much less than the velocity correlation length of the turbulence ,  the spectral lines form under _ macro - turbulent _ conditions [ see for example the simulations of park & hong ( 1995 ) ; see also the review in falgarone  ( 1998 ) ] .",
    "macro - turbulence prevents distinct emission regions of a cloud from `` shadowing '' each other in velocity space , which is statistically equivalent to a large systematic velocity gradient in its effect on the radiative transfer through the cloud .",
    "since the level populations both determine and are determined by the radiation field , the solution of the equation of radiative transfer for co line radiation with self - consistent level populations was performed numerically .",
    "the level populations in a statistical steady state , and the corresponding radiation field were computed for a grid of clouds , each with constant volume density , @xmath138 , kinetic temperature , @xmath139 , and co abundance , . at the surface the incident radiation field was taken to be that due to the 2.7  cosmic microwave background .",
    "it was furthermore assumed that there is no internal radiation source in the clouds .",
    "collisional rate coefficients for co excitation by  were those computed by flower & launay ( 1985 ) .",
    "a constant abundance @xmath140 was assumed ,   in the co - emitting regions approximately 80% of the carbon gas is in co. this is based on the local ism gas - phase carbon abundance which is observed to be [ c]@xmath141 ( sofia , cardelli , guerin , & meyer 1997 ) .",
    "the results do not change drastically if  varies between 5 and 10 @xmath142 .",
    "the abundance of  was assumed to be 1/60 that of ,  [ ] /[]=[]/ [ ] .",
    "we have ignored the effects of chemical fractionation and isotope - selective photodissociation , which would cause the /  abundance ratio to range between 1/70 to 1/35 (  3.5 ; van dishoeck & black 1988 ) .",
    "the populations of the first eight rotational transitions of the  and  molecules were modelled . for each species",
    "the model was run for temperatures ranging from 4 to 40k , for densities ranging from @xmath143 to @xmath144 , and for column density per velocity ranging from @xmath145 to @xmath146/ ( ) .",
    "results for @xmath147 , 22 , 30 , and 40  are displayed in figure [ cloud ] .",
    "the observed range of values of the four ratios , @xmath148 ( defined in equations [ r1 ] through [ r4 ] ) , are indicated by pairs of contours .",
    "the range in the ( 43)/(21 ) ratio is shaded . for reference the size along the line - of - sight , @xmath149 , of co emitting regions",

    "the greyscale images in figure [ cloud_models ] each represent a slice through the probability density field made in the ( ,  @xmath138)plane at a particular temperature .",
    "the dashed contour is a slice through the the 3@xmath55 confidence surface if the ( 43)/(21 ) ratio is neglected and the solid contour represents a slice through the 3@xmath55 confidence surface when the new data are included .",
    "the crosses indicate the point in the ( ,  @xmath138)plane where the probability density reaches its maximum value for the given temperature .    the maximum probability density in each temperature slice , @xmath152 ,  the value of the probability density at the location of the crosses , is printed on the plots .",
    "the probability field has two local maxima , one at @xmath153and one at @xmath154 $ ] .",
    "these correspond to the hdlt and ldht solutions , respectively .",
    "the hdlt solution is the most probable .",
    "this regime is very well - defined in the ( ,  @xmath138)plane , with @xmath1 , and @xmath155 .",
    "it is reassuring that we get the same value of  in the hdlt / lvg model as in the lte model .",
    "the two models tell the same story : if the density is high then the level populations are thermalized in constant - opacity structures with @xmath153 .",
    "the  line center opacities in the lvg model are : @xmath156 9.6 , 14.4 , 6.3 , and 1.0 for the ( 10 ) , ( 21 ) , ( 32 ) , and ( 43 ) transitions , respectively . in this model",
    "all  radiation is produced in gas which is at least marginally optically thick .",
    "as mentioned by fp the implied structure sizes in the hdlt case are very small , less than @xmath157 ( @xmath5au ) , which is consistent with the @xmath158au ",
    "sized structures seen by pound  ( 1991 ) in high  latitude cloud mbm-12 .",
    "this hdlt structure size is @xmath1591% of the average projected co size of hlcs ( @xmath160 ; ingalls 1999 ) .",
    "thus in this interpretation a typical hlc is comprised of an ensemble of @xmath161 hdlt co - emitting cells ( given an area filling fraction of unity ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is still not possible to rule out the ldht solution completely , since the probability field has a second local maximum at @xmath162 which is about 80% as probable as the 8  maximum .",
    "we are , however , able to place a strict upper limit on the temperature in the co - emitting regions due to the predicted size of ldht structures . as mentioned in  1 , the sizes of emitting structures along the line - of - sight ( los ) may be much larger than their sizes in the plane of the sky .",
    "it is not plausible , however , for los structure sizes to exceed the @xmath160 _ cloud _ sizes .",
    "for very high temperatures ( @xmath163 ) the los size of emitting regions with nonzero probability in the model becomes unrealistically large .",
    "unless most observed co structures are filaments aligned along the line of sight , which is unlikely , temperatures greater than @xmath0 must be completely ruled out .",
    "again ( see the lte model ) the  ( 43 ) data significantly decrease the size of the 3@xmath55 surface in the parameter space . in other words ,",
    "the _ range _ of possible solutions is decreased .",
    "remarkably , including the higher transition data does not change the predicted physical conditions .",
    "we plot in figure [ cloud_prob ] the maximum - probability values of @xmath164 , ( ) , and @xmath138 ( the values at the positions of the crosses ) . as for figures [ cloud_lte ] through [ cloud_models ] ,",
    "dashed curves represent these functions when only the ( 32 ) and lower transitions of co are included , and solid curves represent the same functions when the new ( 43 ) data are used .",
    "clearly the new data both limit the range of possible solutions in -space ( figure [ cloud_prob ] , _ top _ ) and also yield cloud conditions that are entirely consistent with those derived using the old data ( figure [ cloud_prob ] , _ middle _ and _ bottom _ ) .",
    "we have studied the j = ( 10 ) through ( 43 ) transitions of co in translucent clouds . motivated by the work of falgarone  ( 1991 ; 1992 ; 1998 ) and fp , instead of treating clouds as separate entities with distinct characteristics , we sought regularity in the co emission . the linear relationships among the ( 10 ) , ( 21 ) , ( 32 ) , and ( 43 ) transitions , as well as the constancy of the 60/100  _ iras _ surface brightness ratio , justify this perspective .",
    "the simplest interpretation of these results is that the emission arises in regions with the same physical properties , or `` cells '' , and that variations in the emission are caused by variations in the beam filling fraction of the cells .",
    "we call this the `` cell hypothesis ''",
    ".    two types of co cell may exist : the low density , high temperature ( ldht ) and the high density low temperature ( hdlt ) cell .",
    "the ldht cell is relatively space - filling , with line of sight sizes of order 50% to 100% of the cloud size .",
    "it is also in thermal pressure equilibrium with the interstellar environment .",
    "the existence of hdlt cells , on the other hand , is controversial .",
    "we have shown that cells with densities of order @xmath165 are the most probable source of co emission .",
    "this challenges the picture of hlcs described by van dishoeck   ( 1991 ) , who argued against the possibility of gas with @xmath166 .",
    "the hdlt scenario also defies one of the primary assumptions of interstellar physics , which holds that clouds are in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "hdlt cells have a thermal pressure @xmath167 , which is an order of magnitude greater than the ambient thermal ism pressure .",
    "is this a serious problem ?",
    "the interstellar medium is turbulent .",
    "its structures are not the result of equilibrium processes . recent simulations of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence performed by ballesteros - paredes , vsquez - semadeni , & scalo ( 1999 ) show that thermal pressure equilibrium is irrelevant , since in mhd turbulence the volume and surface terms of the eulerian virial theorem are comparable . as a consequence ,",
    "structures will nearly always deform under inertial motions , resulting in `` clumping '' on many scales . according to this model , in a turbulent cloud",
    ", clumps are continually forming due to density fluctuations and dissipating due to radiative cooling .",
    "quasi - static configurations are highly unlikely , unless compressed to sizes @xmath168 , where self - gravity becomes important .",
    "ironically , the hdlt cells are approximately this size . if the simulations of ballesteros - paredes  ( 1999 ) are correct , then _",
    "the only stable configuration in translucent molecular clouds is the hdlt one_. this important result needs to be confirmed . is the co emission produced only in stable structures which are in lte ?",
    "this would explain the remarkable uniformity we see in the co line ratios for a large sample of clouds .",
    "we have attempted in this paper to evaluate two competing models for the physical state of molecular gas in translucent clouds , the hdlt and ldht models . both van dishoeck  ( 1991 ) and fp state that neither hdlt nor ldht conditions uniquely describe the data ( even though each group concludes by favoring a different configuration ; see  1 ) . we have assumed that clouds are macro - turbulent , and we have argued that the lvg radiative transfer model is an adequate approximation of macro - turbulence . by deriving a probability density field in the physical parameter space",
    "we have shown quantitatively that hdlt gas is the more likely source of observed co emission .",
    "our analysis is limited , however , by the extent to which the lvg scenario is an accurate representation of the velocity field of translucent gas .",
    "the assumption that clouds are macro - turbulent is based on the extensive three - dimensional radiative transfer simulations done by park & hong ( 1995 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it can be argued that using the macro - turbulent lvg assumption has biased our results in favor of hdlt conditions , since tiny hdlt cells are more likely to satisfy the lvg criterion , because they are less likely to shadow each other along the line of sight than the much larger ( @xmath169pc ) ldht cells .",
    "furthermore , since they have larger values of @xmath170 , ldht cells have a much larger column density of radiatively coupled gas than hdlt cells with the same internal velocity dispersion .",
    "thus the macro - turbulent approximation should break down for the largest ldht cells .",
    "a more complete study would vary the statistics of the velocity field between the micro - turbulent and macro - turbulent limits .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the current paper , and we leave it to future work .",
    "if hdlt cells exist , then they can be detected directly in co emission using a millimeter - wave interferometer .",
    "a _ resolved _ hdlt cell would have a rayleigh - jeans brightness temperature in  ( 10 ) of @xmath171 .",
    "an interferometer with a spatial resolution of 0.001  ( for a cloud at a distance of 100  this corresponds to an angular resolution of 2 ) would be able to detect such hdlt cells .",
    "if there is no detectable  ( 10 ) emission in hlcs at 2  scales , then the hdlt hypothesis is false",

    "<S> the rotational transitions of carbon monoxide ( co ) are the primary means of investigating the density and velocity structure of the molecular interstellar medium . here </S>",
    "<S> we study the lowest four rotational transitions of co towards high  latitude translucent molecular clouds ( hlcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we report new observations of the j = ( 43 ) , ( 21 ) , and ( 10 ) transitions of co towards eight high  latitude clouds . </S>",
    "<S> the new observations are combined with data from the literature to show that the emission from _ all _ observed co transitions is linearly correlated . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the excitation conditions which lead to emission in these transitions are uniform throughout the clouds . </S>",
    "<S> observed /   ( 10 ) integrated intensity ratios are generally much greater than the expected abundance ratio of the two species , indicating that the regions which emit   ( 10 ) radiation are optically thick . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a statistical method to compare the observed line ratios with models of co excitation and radiative transfer . </S>",
    "<S> this enables us to determine the most likely portion of the physical parameter space which is compatible with the observations . the model enables us to rule out co gas temperatures greater than @xmath0 , since the most likely high - temperature configurations are 1-sized structures aligned along the line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> the most probable solution is a high density and low temperature ( hdlt ) solution , with volume density , @xmath1 , kinetic temperature , @xmath2 , and co column density per velocity interval @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the co cell size is @xmath4 ( @xmath5au ) . </S>",
    "<S> these cells are thus tiny fragments within the @xmath6100 times larger co - emitting extent of a typical high  latitude cloud . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the physical implications of hdlt cells , and we suggest ways to test for their existence .    = cmr8 @scaling1.2 # 1 = @scaling # 1 # 1 # 1 # 1 # 1 </S>"
