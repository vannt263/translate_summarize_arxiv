    "the ( time - independent ) @xmath0 equation ( se ) has a variety of solutions according to the boundary conditions we impose on them . besides the physical bound eigenstates ( @xmath1 with discrete negative real energy spectrum and positive purely imaginary momenta ) we have marginally physical ones ( continuum of positive real energy scattering solutions @xmath2 ) , complex - energy solutions ( resonances @xmath3 ) , the also unphysical anti - bound states ( @xmath4 with negative purely imaginary momenta ) , and , finally , a complex - energy continuum of `` background '' states ( @xmath5 ) . out of these states , only the bound states have a finite norm ( that is , @xmath6 , the hilbert space ) .",
    "the properties and uses of the real - energy bound and scattering ( dirac ) states are a standard textbook topic on foundations of quantum mechanics .",
    "also the resonances ( known as gamow states @xcite ) have deserved extensive attention in the literature as descriptive of decaying states . however they feature a spatially divergent asymptotic behaviour , which leads to infinite norms and seemingly divergent inner products .",
    "this problem has historically hampered the study of these solutions and spurred several attempts to circumvent it by trying different regularization prescriptions .",
    "examples of this are analytical continuations of the inner products in the complex momentum plane , the external complex scaling of the space coordinate , and the introduction of convergence factors in the space integrals .",
    "the interested reader may find some bibliographical cues on these proposals in @xcite @xcite @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the gaussian regularization has been used to achieve new results on the computation of the inner products involving resonances .    in this paper",
    "we complete our previous results , obtained for a general 1-dimensional potential with finite support , by considering the full set of solutions of the se including the anti - bound and the `` background '' states .    in section 2 , we first characterize the solutions according to the boundary conditions ( bcs ) they obey , having the outgoing ( obcs ) and incoming ( ibcs ) boundary conditions a chief role .",
    "we will show that also the bound and anti - bound solutions fit in the ensuing classification .",
    "we then introduce a general form of the solution to the se as a master solution ( ms ) from which all the solutions above stem as particular cases .    in section 3",
    "we exploit this master solution to obtain a compact master inner product ( mip ) from which the table of the particular inner products between all the solutions can be worked out .",
    "this general framework lets us to see how the different kinds of orthogonality , namely kronecker-@xmath7 , dirac-@xmath7 , or other , stem from a common expression .    in section 4",
    "the conclusions are drawn .",
    "the details of some calculations and the basic integral formulas are deferred to appendices .",
    "we consider the 1-d time - independent @xmath0 equation @xmath8\\;\\psi(x , p ) = 0\\ ] ] where we have used units such that @xmath9 , and a cut - off potential @xmath10 describing a general barrier with support in the compact interval [ 0,_l _ ] .",
    "we also assume that the potential features local negative minima ( wells ) such that bound states occur .    besides the better known scattering _ in _ and _ out _ solutions for continuous real energy @xmath11 and the bound and anti - bound states ( discrete real @xmath12 , one has resonant solutions satisfying the siegert boundary conditions @xcite , and the more general continuous complex - energy `` background '' solutions .",
    "here we briefly highlight some of their features and introduce our systematics together with some notation .",
    "we also stress that outside [ 0,_l _ ] the solutions already adopt their asymptotic form ( af ) for @xmath13 , the use of which may be a convenient alternative to their bcs at @xmath14 ( or at @xmath15 ) .",
    "the bcs maybe algebraic or differential and the general setup is that imposing one bc leaves the functional degree of freedom corresponding to a continuum ( energy or momentum ) spectrum , as is the case of the scattering and background solutions , whereas two bcs over - determine the problem yielding a discrete spectrum , whether of real energies ( bound and anti - bound solutions ) or complex energies ( resonances ) .",
    "graphical representations of the location of the momenta of the different solutions in the complex - momentum plane can be found in @xcite .",
    "the bound states @xmath1 are the only solutions @xmath16 and they are characterized by the af @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "this is equivalent to imposing the bcs @xmath19 which imply the weaker bcs @xmath20 .",
    "the anti - bound solutions instead correspond to the mirror values @xmath21 in ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , then becoming @xmath22 ( thus dubbed unphysical ) , and have the same negative energies @xmath23 .",
    "the af of both types of solutions maybe viewed as plane waves ( say @xmath24 in the right side of the barrier ) with purely imaginary `` momenta '' @xmath25 which may lie in the positive imaginary axis @xmath26 ( bound states ) or in the negative one @xmath27 ( anti - bound solutions ) .",
    "this interpretation makes these states akin to the resonances .",
    "the _ tilde _",
    "notation we have adopted for the bound solutions reflects their relationship with the _ incoming _ resonances below .",
    "they are characterized by the siegert homogeneous _",
    "outgoing _ bcs ( obcs ) @xmath28 from where ( 3 ) is recovered as the particular case of purely imaginary momenta @xmath29 .",
    "solutions @xmath30 , called proper resonances , exist for a denumerable set of isolated complex values @xmath31 of @xmath32 ( with corresponding complex energies @xmath33 ) lying inside the octants close to the real axis ( i.e. @xmath34 ) in the lower half complex plane @xmath35 ( i.e. @xmath36 ) , and occupy symmetrical positions with respect to the imaginary axis .",
    "it is customary to label them as @xmath31 ( @xmath37 ) when @xmath38 and as @xmath39 their symmetric ones , some times called anti - resonances .",
    "the real parts @xmath40 tend to be spaced regularly for increasing @xmath41 , while @xmath42 grows slowly @xcite .",

    "solutions @xmath44 . for real potentials",
    "@xmath10 one has that @xmath45 , and the momenta @xmath46 lie in the upper half complex plane @xmath47 . we denote with @xmath48 these states . as stressed above , the bound states maybe viewed as incoming resonances with zero real part momenta , whereas the anti - bound solutions would be particular cases of the outgoing resonances .",
    "the obcs are equivalent to imposing the asymptotic form @xmath49 where the amplitudes @xmath50 and @xmath51 differ by a phase and are defined up to a global arbitrary normalization factor .",
    "an immediate consequence is that the norm is even more divergent than for the dirac states , causing both kinds of states not to belong to @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , inner products involving resonant ( as well as any other non - normalizable ) states , maybe expected to be generally divergent as well , so that their actual calculation requires a regularization .",
    "the continuum spectrum of the scattering states maybe characterized by just one bc , which can be taken at @xmath53 or @xmath54 and chosen to be of the outgoing or of the incoming type , with an obvious corresponding af .",
    "let us call sbcs any of these choices .",
    "for instance , a right - moving @xmath55 state obeys only the second obc in ( 4 ) with @xmath56 .",
    "this is equivalent to imposing the following form @xmath57 where the form of the solution in @xmath58 $ ] depends on @xmath10 , and we adopt the @xmath7-energy wave function normalization @xmath59 .",
    "we stress here that the customary @xmath55-@xmath60 notation for the scattering states is misleading as referring to the bcs they obey , as long as obcs correspond to @xmath55 states , like ( 6 ) , whereas ibcs yield the _ out _ states @xmath61 .      the continuation to the complex plane @xmath62 of the scattering solutions @xmath63 is the guiding thread of this paper .",
    "for a general complex momentum @xmath64 one directly has the so - called @xmath65 solutions .",
    "for instance , out of ( 6 ) one has @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the complex energy .",
    "we notice that , for @xmath69 almost everywhere in @xmath70 , the absolute value of ( 7 ) diverges for @xmath71 , @xmath72 , or both , because of the presence of the asymptotic reflected wave . as an example",
    ", we see that @xmath73 diverges for @xmath13 when @xmath74 , and only for @xmath72 when @xmath75 .",
    "the solution ( 7 ) features reflection , transmission ( and others in the region @xmath58 $ ] ) amplitudes , which share a common denominator @xmath76 , which is related to the ( radial ) jost functions in the case of the ( s - wave ) 3-d scattering .",
    "it goes similarly for the general solution @xmath77 .",
    "generally , @xmath78 has complex zeroes @xmath79 ( resonances ) and pure imaginary ones @xmath80 ( bound and anti - bound momenta ) .",
    "we then write @xmath81 , @xmath82 , etc . , where the numerators are holomorphic functions of @xmath69 .",
    "multiplying ( 7 ) by @xmath76 we then define the master solution @xmath83 for real @xmath84 , @xmath85 is regular and one one has @xmath86 .",
    "instead , ( 8) readily yields the resonant and ( we shall see ) anti - bound solutions , respectively at @xmath79 and @xmath80 .    as an example , the denominator @xmath85 , specific to the _ in _",
    "states @xmath87 , and its partner @xmath88 of the _ out _ states , have the following form in the case of a square potential well with depth @xmath89 and width @xmath90 : @xmath91 where @xmath92 . for real @xmath43",
    "they are related by complex conjugation , which is equivalent to changing the sign of the momenta @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "notice that the derivation of ( 9 ) from sbcs is valid only for @xmath95 , so that the value @xmath96 ( to which it corresponds @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) is a meaningless zero of ( 9 ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath99 are the only points of @xmath70 for which no eigenfunction of ( 1 ) obeying sbcs exists , whereas @xmath100 ( i.e. @xmath101 ) is a proper eigenvalue ( although @xmath101 is not a zero of ( 9 ) ) to which the trivial null scattering eigenfunction corresponds . for ibcs ( or obcs )",
    "the eigenfunctions corresponding to @xmath102 ( or @xmath103 ) exist but are null .",
    "as noticed above , there exists a crisscrossed genetic kinship between the _ in _ ( _ out _ ) scattering solutions and the outgoing ( incoming ) resonances defined by the obcs ( ibcs ) , including the anti - bound ( bound ) states , rendering the extension of the former to the complex plane a little messy @xcite . for complex momenta the terms _ incoming _ and _ outgoing _ loose much physical meaning , which maybe related , at most , to the sign of the real part of the momenta .",
    "this relationship breaks down for the resonant ( either outgoing or incoming ) solutions , which have momenta with both positive and negative real parts , and it is fully meaningless for the bound and anti - bound solutions , which have zero real part . the obcs ( ibcs ) rather determine the location of the zeroes in @xmath35 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "in fact , it can be shown ( appendix a ) that the obcs ( ibcs ) imply that the momenta of the solutions feature a negative ( positive ) imaginary part , regardless the real part being zero ( bound and anti - bound states ) or finite ( resonances ) .",
    "the zeroes of the denominators ( 9 ) can be pinpointed only by numerically computing the roots of @xmath104 or @xmath105 . however the naive use of mathematical programs may yield spooky results that can be traced back to the default used for the branching of the square root function , so that @xmath106 not always yields @xmath69 .",
    "for instance , in the case of @xmath107 for the square well in ( 9 ) , one may find the expected resonance zeroes in @xmath35 together with only _",
    "part _ of the anti - bound momenta in the lower imaginary axis _ plus _ some bound state momenta ( upper axis ) .",
    "the remaining ones , together with the incoming resonant momenta in @xmath47 , stem from @xmath108 , the roots of which are the complex conjugates of @xmath107 .    to conclude this section , an overview of the location in the complex plane of the momenta corresponding to the different types of solutions above",
    "is given in figure 1 .",
    "from the ms ( 8) we may obtain a master inner product ( mip ) @xmath109 where the labels @xmath110 are understood and will be omitted in the following .",
    "the integral can be computed along the usual lines ( appendix b ) , yielding @xmath111\\,{\\cal d}^*{\\cal d}'\\\\ + [ i(-(z^*-z'))+\\frac{\\rmi}{z^*-z'}]\\,({\\cal r}^*{\\cal r}'+{\\cal t}^*{\\cal t}')\\\\ + [ i(-(z^*+z'))+\\frac{\\rmi}{z^*+z'}]\\,{\\cal r}^*{\\cal d}'\\\\ + [ i(z^*+z')-\\frac{\\rmi}{z^*+z'}]\\,{\\cal d}^*{\\cal r}'\\\\ \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath112 , and the primed notation is explained in that appendix .",
    "all the inner products of the different families of solutions with themselves , and with each other , can be derived from ( 11 ) , and in the remaining of this section we shall outline the technicalities of the most relevant cases .      for real @xmath113 and @xmath114",

    "the terms @xmath121 vanish because @xmath122 is always @xmath123 , and the terms @xmath124 sum up to @xmath125 = \\frac{m}{p}\\,\\delta(p - p')=\\delta(e - e')\\ ] ] as expected from the wave function normalization adopted .",
    "for general complex @xmath69 and @xmath126 , the general form of @xmath118 ( appendix c ) leads to the result @xmath127 thus , for each background state @xmath128 of momentum @xmath69 , there is a `` neighborhood of divergence '' so that @xmath128 is orthogonal to any other @xmath129 the momentum @xmath126 of which lies outside a `` divergence wedge '' , with an angle of @xmath130 and apex in @xmath131 , and gives a divergent inner product if @xmath126 lies inside this wedge .",
    "the rule is reciprocal : we may consider as well the location of @xmath69 with respect to the wedge with apex in @xmath132 .",
