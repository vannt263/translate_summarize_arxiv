    "the lmc is a nearby dynamically active satellite galaxy , exhibiting multiple epochs of star formation , while also suffering from tidal interactions with the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) and the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "given its proximity , stellar populations in the lmc are easily resolved in deep surveys , allowing us to obtain information such as ages , chemical abundances , kinematics and distances to individual stars and star clusters .",
    "thus , the lmc represents an excellent local laboratory to study the effects of gravitational forces on the evolution of a satellite galaxy , including its star formation history ( sfh ) and age - metallicity relation ( amr ) .",
    "a wealth of data describing the structure and stellar populations of the lmc has been accumulated over decades of research .",
    "the lmc is known to have a stellar disk inclined relative to the line of sight towards its center by @xmath3 with a position angle of @xmath4 .",
    "this disk also seems to have a warp and to be flared .",
    "a large number of studies have tried to reconstruct its sfh and/or amr , often in connection to the smc .    regarding the stellar populations and their variation as a function of position , many studies attempt to reconstruct the sfh and/or amr of the lmc , based on field stars  @xcite , clusters in the relatively central region ( @xmath0 10 kpc )   or both  @xcite .",
    "the results have been inconsistent , as no single sfh and amr applies to the entire lmc body or to clusters and field stars alike @xcite . in a recent paper , @xcite analyse 5.5 million lmc field stars and present age and metallicity trends with distance from the lmc center ( out to 8 kpc ) and an amr .",
    "their results are more consistent with outside - in star formation and chemical enrichment",
    ". they also find larger spreads in age and metallicity in the outer regions and no clear age gap in the field star formation .",
    "@xcite investigate fields stars farther out , from 5.2 to 9.2 kpc from the lmc center , and find age and metallicity gradients only for the youngest and the most metal rich stars .",
    "for the star clusters ,   fit padova and geneva   isochrones to a sample of 1193 young lmc clusters within 4 deg of its center and find two periods of enhanced cluster formation , at 125 myr and 800 myr .",
    "they argue that these peaks in the cluster formation rate may be connected with the last encounter of the lmc and smc .",
    "in contrast with our knowledge of the inner structure and stellar populations of the lmc , much less is known about the periphery at distances @xmath5 10 kpc .",
    "covering the extended outer lmc regions requires a large - area , photometric , and homogeneous sample .",
    "this has recently been provided by the early data taken as part of the dark energy survey ( des ) science verification ( sv ) . in this work we aim to probe clusters in the outer lmc field in des - sv footprint , using a homogeneous data sample .",

    "the des @xcite is a 5,000 deg@xmath6 imaging survey in _ grizy _ bands currently being carried out using decam , a 3 deg@xmath6 ( @xmath7 diameter ) wide - field mosaic camera on the ctio blanco 4 m telescope @xcite .",
    "des will reach a characteristic photometric depth of @xmath8 magnitude ( with s / n=  10 for @xmath9 band , point - like sources ) and enable accurate photometry and morphology of objects ten times fainter than the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the decam images are reduced by the des data management ( desdm ) team , which has a pipeline to coadd and calibrate ( astrometrically and photometrically ) images and finally catalog and classify the objects in the images .",
    "the final coadd images are called _",
    "tiles _ , with a size of 0.75 degree @xmath10 0.75 degree ( @xmath11 pixels ) .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a substantial challenge for deep ground - based surveys is the star / galaxy separation .",
    "desdm performs photometric analysis with sextractor , a software package which identifies and selects sources above a threshold based on the image background .",
    "the blend parameter determines whether a group of neighboring pixels must be classified as a single source or multiple objects @xcite .",
    "the final catalog produces several magnitude measurements ( _ mag_auto _ and _ mag_psf _ , for example ) and _ spread_model _ as the main star / galaxy separator .",
    "this is based on the difference between the best fitting local point spread function ( psf ) model and a slightly more extended model made from the same psf convolved with a circular exponential disk model with scale - length equal to fwhm/16 ( where fwhm is the full - width - half maximum of the psf model ) .",
    "the des - sv data were taken from november 2012 to february 2013 for a total of 427 hours of observation .",
    "the data were intended to test decam capabilities and the desdm data pipeline ( calibration and photometry , astrometry , image quality , pointing and guiding , operational readiness and pipelines for supernova ) .",
    "the largest contiguous area of the sv campaign was the south pole telescope east field ( spt - e ) , which is located immediately to the north of the lmc .",
    "this work is based on the coadd data products from the first release processing of the sv observations ( sva1 ) , which includes the spt - e region ( 157 deg@xmath6 ) in 2537 exposures .",
    "an initial sample of lmc star clusters in the spt - e region was obtained by a visual inspection of the sv coadd images , on a tile by tile basis .",
    "we used the tile viewer tool available at the des science portal  @xcite , which is a web based facility .",
    "the list of spt - e tiles was initially split among five of the authors with an overlap region among them .",
    "almost all lmc clusters were found in the southern part of the field , which was inspected by two of us .",
    "the overlapping region included ten clusters found by one of the authors , eight of which comprised the sample found by the other .",
    "not unexpectedly , the two extra objects were poor clusters . despite the low numbers , this sample overlap suggests a uniform sampling among the richer systems analyzed in ",
    "[ clusanalysis ] .    after eliminating repeats from the individual searches , the original cluster list contained 294 candidates .",
    "we then matched our candidates with the @xcite lmc clusters catalog .",
    "our list contains a total of 109 previously uncatalogued objects .",
    "seven objects included in the @xcite catalog were not in our original list . by visually inspecting their images ,",
    "one of these objects was clearly a galaxy and another was very close to a bright star , leaving a total of 299 cluster candidates in the spt - e region .",
    "the sample was further refined using the @xmath12 cmds ( from daophot , see  [ daophotpipe ] ) .",
    "44 out of the 299 visually inspected candidates had cmds that were not consistent with simple or composite stellar populations , usually containing a large fraction of faint red sources , more consistent with galaxy clusters .",
    "the filtered subsample has 255 candidates consistent with being star clusters .      since the des main goals",
    "are cosmological in nature , the science requirements for the data are related to detecting , measuring and characterizing galaxies , not stars .",
    "therefore , we ran a complementary diagnostic of the des - sv stellar catalog .",
    "our main concern was to investigate the completeness of the sva1 stellar catalog as a function of s / n and crowding , since this aspect is crucial to the analysis of lmc clusters presented here .",
    "for that purpose , we used routines from iraf / daophot , which is the benchmark program to detect and measure stellar data in crowded fields .",
    "details about our daophot reduction and photometry pipeline are provided in  [ daophotpipe ] .",
    "a full description of stellar completeness in sva1 catalogs can be found in a future technical paper ( pieres et al 2015 , in prep . ) .",
    "below we summarize our basic conclusions :    1 .",
    "colour - magnitude diagrams based on the stellar samples drawn from standard daophot selection , using psf magnitude errors and sharpness , are similar to those from sva1 , based on _",
    "spread_model _ cuts . in the spt - e fields covering the outer lmc ,",
    "the cmds from both sva1 and daophot clearly display the main features of the lmc field population , such as a ms ranging from 18 @xmath13 g @xmath13 24 , an old msto at g@xmath1422.5 , g - r @xmath140.2 , a red giant branch and a red clump with g @xmath13 22 and g - r @xmath15 0.3 .",
    "2 .   in typical des regions , well away from the lmc , the source density is about 1/10 of that found in regions where most star clusters are found . in this low - density regime , as well as inside poor lmc clusters , sva1 completeness relative to daophot is close to 1 down to g @xmath16 20 .",
    "sva1 catalogs tend to sample fewer point sources than daophot at fainter magnitudes , but the relative completeness varies depending on how we separate stars from galaxies in either case .",
    "sva1 stellar completeness is a strong function of source density , dropping abruptly from @xmath14 0.3 to @xmath13 0.1 for surface densities @xmath15 260 stars / arcmin@xmath6 .",
    "in particular , the sva1 stellar sample is very incomplete in crowded fields , such as those close to the centers of rich lmc star clusters . in these regions ,",
    "sva1 samples less than 50% of the objects detected by daophot , even at bright magnitudes ( g @xmath13 19 ) . inside",
    "rich cluster cores , the sva1 incompleteness is large enough to cause local holes in the surface density distribution of point sources on the sky .",
    "this result is robust to the way we separate stars from galaxies .    with these results in mind",
    ", we decided that we could not use the sva1 catalogs inside and around the lmc clusters .",
    "however , we used sva1 coadd images to identify cluster candidates and its catalogs to fit zeropoints to daophot photometry .",
    "we also decided to use three bands ( two colors ) instead of two , to better describe the stellar locus of each cluster candidate .",
    "for reference , a comparison of both software packages ( sextractor with psfex and daophot with allstar ) can be found in  @xcite . in ",
    "[ daophotpipe ] we describe in detail the data reduction and analysis based on our daophot pipeline .      as mentioned earlier",
    ", the sva1 catalog is incomplete in crowded regions , such as inside lmc star clusters . to bypass this problem",
    ", we used the sva1 coadd image products in the vicinity of each of our candidate clusters as inputs for our own photometric extraction based on daophot . for each object we made an image cutout with 6.75 arcmin on a side , visually centered on the candidate , in three bands : @xmath9 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the iraf / daophot routines were combined into a pipeline to reduce des coadd cutouts ( fig .",
    "[ flux ] ) .",
    "this pipeline is a set of scripts using the tasks _ daofind _ , _ phot _ , _ pstselect _ , _ psf _ , _ allstar _ and works as follows .",
    "first , we combined _ g _ and _ r _ images and ran _ daofind _ to detect sources on these combined images ; we rejected sources that were less than 3.0 @xmath19 above the background .",
    "we then picked the 50 brightest sources to use as a starting template for psf modelling ( running _ psf _ task ) . with the initial psf model",
    "allstar _ over all sources found and refined our set of psf stars by choosing those with small enhancement above the sky background ( @xmath20 3 counts ) , low magnitude error ( @xmath20 0.01 mag ) and low chi - square ( @xmath20 0.2 ) .",
    "this procedure of refining the psf after an initial _ allstar _ run is meant to make the process subject to minimal human interference ( although some human decision were still needed at times ) .",
    "the full processing requires about 20 minutes for each run on one image using a single - core desktop computer .",
    "python and fortran routines were made to select the stars and convert their @xmath21 and @xmath22 coordinates to / from x and y coordinates . using a program similar to the _",
    "join _ linux command , we then composed the daophot catalogs from each filter .",
    "we then determined _ g _ , _ r _ and _ i _ zeropoints , by taking des catalog photometry as reference , and created the final daophot catalog .",
    "the stars used for this calibration were those that satisfied the following criteria : @xmath23 and @xmath24 in @xmath9 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 filters .",
    "the corresponding sources in sva1 had to have @xmath25 and magnitude error @xmath26 .",
    "the standard deviation for these difference ( @xmath27 ) has typical values @xmath20 0.02 .",
    "after the reduction , diagnostic plots were made to evaluate the daophot catalog completeness level and to make reduction sanity checks .",
    "an example of these diagnostic plots is shown in fig .",
    "[ diagnostic ] .",
    "the criteria we used to define sources as stars from the daophot catalog were magnitude error @xmath28 and @xmath29 in _ g , r _ and _ i _ bands .",
    "stars used for refining the psf model or for calibration purposes were subject to more stringent selection criteria , as explained earlier .",
    "our daophot based selection of stars is still prone to substantial contamination by galaxies",
    ". however , within a typical visual cluster radius this contamination amounts to less than 2% .",
    "a parallel analysis of relative completeness ( sva1 and daophot catalogs , using the same pipeline reduction presented here ) has been reported by  @xcite in their sec .",
    "we used the king azimuthally symmetric profile  @xcite as the standard model to describe the surface density profile of the star cluster candidates :    @xmath30^{\\frac{1}{2 } } } - { \\frac{1}{[1+(r_t / r_c)^2]^{\\frac{1}{2}}}}\\right)^2\\ ] ]     + where @xmath31 is the surface number density of cluster stars , @xmath17 is the angular distance from the center ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 in cutout ) , @xmath34 is the cluster _ core radius _ and",
    "@xmath35 is the cluster _",
    "tidal radius_. the parameter @xmath36 is the profile normalization and is related to the central surface density .",
    "the king density profile is widely used for both high and low mass galactic clusters  .",
    "the king parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 and centroid were determined using a maximum - likelihood estimate ( mle ) .",
    "first , we determined the background density of stellar sources in the cutout image , @xmath37 .",
    "we do that by counting stars farther than two times a visually determined cluster radius and dividing this number count by the corresponding area . after we determined the background density , we estimated the number of stars @xmath38 belonging to the cluster by following the recipe by @xcite :    @xmath39     + where @xmath40 is the cutout area and @xmath41 is the total number of stars in the cutout . the profile normalization constant @xmath36 is determined for each profile by dividing the number of cluster stars ( @xmath42 ) by the integral of the king profile from the center to @xmath35 :    @xmath43^{\\frac{1}{2 } } } - { \\frac{1}{[1+(r_t / r_c)^2]^{\\frac{1}{2}}}})^2}\\ ] ]     + in the fitting process , we varied the center position ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) and the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( these parameters are determined from the model profile grid ) , evaluating the initial estimates by eye .",
    "the likelihood that star @xmath18 belongs to the full model ( king profile ) with radii @xmath34 and @xmath35 and centered at @xmath32 and @xmath33 and normalized to @xmath36 is :    @xmath44^{\\frac{1}{2 } } } - { \\frac{1}{[1+(r_t / r_c)^2]^{\\frac{1}{2}}}}\\right)^2 + \\rho_{bg}\\ ] ]     + where @xmath45 is the radial distance of the given star from that model center .",
    "the most likely model ( defined by parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 and position @xmath46 ) is the one which maximizes the log - likelihood summed over all stars : @xmath47 + where @xmath48 is @xmath41 in equation  [ 3n ] .",
    "notice that , in practice , stars located outide the tidal radius of each model profile contribute to the likelihood with @xmath49 .",
    "we also used a maximum - likelihood approach to determine the cluster sample stellar populations ( ssp ) : age , metallicity , distance modulus and reddening .",
    "as in the fit for the density profiles , the basic step is to measure the likelihood that each star is taken from a modelled isochrone displaced by a given distance modulus and extinction vector . in this work , we are using three magnitudes , @xmath9 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the distance from the isochrone in magnitude space must be evaluated in 3d space . for this purpose",
    ", we used the parsec isochrones  @xcite and adopted the galactic extinction law of  @xcite .",
    "the reddening is used to constrain extinction as measured in each magnitude . as a result of our choice ,",
    "extinction is then given as    @xmath50    @xmath51    @xmath52     + notice that this choice of extinction law leads to very similar results ( within the uncertainties ) to a typical lmc extinction curve  @xcite for @xmath53 and @xmath18 decam filters .",
    "the isochrone fitting works as follows .",
    "given the best - fit density profile , we first assigned a probability that star @xmath18 belongs to the candidate cluster as :    @xmath54     + where @xmath37 is the background star density , as described in the previous section .",
    "we applied a threshold cut in @xmath55 to select the stars to use in the fit .",
    "we then computed the gaussian likelihood that a given isochrone is the correct one describing this set of stars .",
    "we first determined the distance of star @xmath18 to isochrone @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "this is the minimum distance of the star in the @xmath58-dimensional photometric space ( in this case , _ g _ , _ r _ and _ i _ magnitudes ) to the isochrone : @xmath59\\ ] ] + where the sum is over all photometric bands , @xmath60 is the closest isochrone magnitude in band @xmath61 to the observed magnitude of star @xmath18 ( @xmath62 ) , and @xmath63 is the uncertainty in @xmath62 .",
    "the isochrone magnitudes are already displaced by the distance modulus and reddening , both of which are free fit parameters . to avoid numerical limitations",
    ", we interpolate the isochrone points when determining @xmath57 , instead of using the discrete set of isochrone points .",
    "notice that @xmath57 corresponds to the highest likelihood term that the star @xmath18 is drawn from isochrone model @xmath56 , which is then given by    @xmath64     + finally , the logarithmic likelihood that the set of @xmath48 stars that satisfies the @xmath55 criterion are drawn from isochrone model @xmath56 can be written as    @xmath65     +      we are dealing with a maximization problem where we want to find the model which best describes the set of likely cluster stars .",
    "given a grid in parameter space of age , metallicity , distance and reddening , we found the peak of @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) , and we probe the @xmath68 space around this global maximum . the @xmath69 values",
    "behave similarly to a @xmath70 distribution , assuming that uncertainties have gaussian ( or similar ) behaviour close to the peak . in this way we estimate the @xmath71 confidence level in the same manner as the @xmath70 distribution  @xcite but considering the covariance among parameters using the profile likelihood technique  @xcite .",
    "for example , when determining the uncertainty in the age we scan the likelihood in age , maximizing with respect to the other parameters .",
    "thus , the @xmath71 confidence intervals are determined when the log of the profile likelihood drops by @xmath72 from its maximum value .",
    "the uncertainties quoted in this work correspond to 1@xmath19 confidence level ( 68% ) .",
    "we test our profile and isochrone fitting in simulated star clusters in sec .",
    "[ clussimul ] .",
    "the next section presents the model grids to do that .",
    "the likelihood optimization methods outlined in the previous sections require a grid of models , both for the structure ( profile fitting ) and for the other physical parameters ( cmd fitting ) .",
    "the lmc clusters vary in size by about an order of magnitude , as will be shown later in this paper .",
    "therefore , it was not possible to use a single grid in @xmath34 and @xmath35 for all clusters . furthermore , initial guesses from visual estimates were not always useful in constraining an optimal range in core and tidal radii .",
    "as a result , the profile fits were carried out interactively , with a size grid that varied from one cluster to the other .",
    "the central positions were allowed to vary within @xmath73 as taken from the previous iteration , until convergence .",
    "we define convergence to occur when the algorithm indicates a likelihood maximum close to the center of the parameter s range . for some candidates ,",
    "the range in @xmath35 continuously increased and reached the limit of the cutout ( much greater than the visual radius ) , which means the set of stars does not present a clear overdensity .",

    ", there are parameter estimates from more than one source in the literature , while for hodge 4 , eso121 - 03 , ngc 2193 and reticulum cluster only one reference was found .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ literature ] and fig .",
    "[ lit ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results listed in table  [ literature ] come from a variety of different methods and data .",
    "most of them are based on cmd analysis , like our own . in this sense , the fits found in previous works are not necessarily more accurate than ours . in particular , none of those papers are based on the same set of parsec isochrones used in this work and some of them are not based on optical data , as is the case of  @xcite .",
    "these issues , coupled with variations in methodology , are probably the cause of the spread in the parameters from different authors , or even among the same authors , as attested by the compilation of ngc 1868 and ngc 2162 results .",
    "even with this spread , there is a clear correlation between our fits and literature , as one can see in fig .",
    "[ lit ] for all the parameters .",
    "[ lit ] testifies that there is no strong systematic trends in our determinations .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the soundness of our methodology is further corroborated based on these real data comparisons .    for the structural parameters , we had no overlap with the large sample of clusters measured by  @xcite .",
    "the only paper with a common sample is  @xcite , who measure surface brightness profiles compared to our star density profiles .",
    "the authors describe how it is difficult to reconcile their results with density profiles in the literature .",
    "a possible explanation for this discrepancy is incompleteness , which affects the density profile much more than surface brightness profiles , since fainter stars have low weight in surface brightness profile while in density profiles all stars have the same weight .",
    "the incompleteness severely affects crowded systems , as ngc 1868 and ngc 2162 , for which we find core radii 15 and 5 times larger , respectively , than  @xcite . for hodge 4 ( a less crowded cluster )",
    ", this ratio decreases to 3 times larger .    in fig  [ comp ]",
    "we show completeness curves in _ gri _ bands integrated over the entire cutout of sl262 .",
    "we also show completeness curves in the centers of moderately and severely crowded clusters , namely sl 262 and ngc 1868 . for that purpose",
    ", we picked a square image ( 54 @xmath10 54 arcsec ) centered in each cluster . for clarity curves are only presented for @xmath9 band , but are similar at other bands .",
    "the completeness levels shown correlate well with the strong discrepancies we find with respect to  @xcite and suggests further that incompleteness is the dominant source of these discrepancies .",
    "notice that rich clusters which have crowded centers make up about 15% of our sample .",
    "the completeness was estimated in our data by inserting @xmath108 artificial stars in 10 realizations of the image in each band ( g , r and i ) for the two clusters cited above .",
    "we then proceeded to reduce the artificial stars in the same manner as the des - sv data .",
    "the inserted stars vary in the range @xmath109 . the criteria to recover stars are the same used to classify a source as star : @xmath110 and @xmath111 , and a maximum deviation from initial position equal to 0.8 arcsec .",
    "to test whether the differences between our estimate of the core radius and those in the literature might stem from completeness , we used the same maximum likelihood method for the ngc 1868 profile , but selecting only stars with g @xmath0 21.5 .",
    "the corresponding core radius using the latter sample ( less affected by incompleteness ) decreased to 0.58 of the value initially measured ( using stars with g @xmath0 24 ) .",
    "the tidal radius increased 10% ( certainly due to statistical variations , given the lower star counts in cluster outer regions ) .",
    "we then conclude the completeness is the main cause of difference between our determinations and those from  @xcite .      in this section",
    ", we analyse the distribution of lmc clusters as a function of size , age , metallicity and position in space .    figs .",

    "the concentration distribution is very similar to the one shown by  @xcite ( top panel of their fig .",
    "14 ) , which is based on fits to radial luminosity profiles . both display a broad peak around c = 0.6 , and another peak at very low concentration values . in our analysis",
    "this latter peak is not as pronounced , probably attesting a strong selection bias in favour of clusters with high contrast to background ( in this work ) , which will tend to be more concentrated at a fixed richness .",
    "another reason for this mild discrepancy is that the authors used a radius encompassing 90% of luminosity rather than the tidal radius .    the central density relative background histogram has a peak @xmath2 3.5 times background density",
    "a small number of clusters have densities near the background value ; these are mainly located closer to the lmc center .",
    "in contrast , the high values for central densities usually occur for clusters located farther from the lmc center .",
    "the most notable cluster in this sense is the reticulum cluster , which is located in a region where the stellar density is very low .",
    "this cluster does not have a crowded central region , allowing for good photometric parameter estimation .",
    "the age distribution of the lmc clusters in our sample presents two main peaks , at @xmath141.2 and @xmath142.7 gyr .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ agesample ] ( top right panel ) .",
    "the same figure also shows ages as a function of position on the sky ( top left panel ) and distance to the lmc center ( @xmath17 ; bottom left panel ) .",
    "no obvious age gradient is seen in this latter plot .    to assess the significance of the observed bimodality",
    ", we carried out kolmogorov - smirnov tests based on the null - hypotheses that the observed distribution is either single or doubled peaked .",
    "we limited the test to clusters with @xmath0 4 gyr ( 114 clusters from the total of 117 clusters ) .",
    "we fitted the observed age distribution to models with one and two gaussians .",
    "we then created 1000 random samples of ages with the same size as the real sample and following each of these models , and applied the ks test comparing each realization to the real distribution .",
    "the average result over 1000 realizations indicates that the real clusters do not originate from a unimodal distribution ( @xmath114 = 0.026 or @xmath115 ) .",
    "therefore , we can reject the hypothesis that the real age distribution comes from an unimodal distribution .",
    "for the double gaussian model , the best - fit age peaks confirm the visual estimates , corresponding to @xmath116 and @xmath117 gyrs , respectively .",
    "and the average @xmath118 over 1000 realizations is @xmath119 , showing that the observed distribution is consistent with the adopted null hypothesis in this case .",
    "we also tried to follow the recipe in  @xcite to investigate the best - fit multi - peak model for the observed age distribution in the sample .",
    "however , our fits for one , two , and three gaussians resulted in different standard deviations : 0.43 and 0.3 gyrs for two peaks , and 0.44 , 0.12 and 0.16 gyr for three peaks .",
    "the lack of homoscedastic distributions in the current situation rendered any the results from the method by @xcite less reliable , as discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "given the observed bimodality in the age distribution , we split the sample into two classes , of clusters younger and older than 2gyr .",
    "we calculated a mean @xmath17 for these two age classes , obtaining @xmath120 kpc and @xmath121 kpc , respectively .",
    "we also computed cylindrical coordinates of each cluster based on an lmc disk model from @xcite .",
    "these authors fit the des - sv field stars distribution and derive the disk position angle and inclination with respect to the sky .",
    "the lmc center and heliocentric distances were kept fixed in the fit at @xmath122 @xcite and @xmath123 kpc @xcite . to determine the cylindrical coordinates",
    ", we used the transformations presented in  @xcite . in the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ agesample ] , we plot the ages against the @xmath124 coordinate , along the disk plane , and again infer an essentially flat relation .",
    "the @xmath125 values for our two age subsamples are 5.44 and 5.9 kpc for the younger and older clusters , respectively .",
    "our sample covers an unprecedented range in distances from the lmc ( from @xmath24kpc out to @xmath213kpc ) , reaching out to previously unexplored outer lmc regions . the clusters age distribution presented here is complementary to that shown by @xcite who study field stars in regions corresponding to deprojected distances in the range from @xmath20.5kpc out to @xmath28kpc .",
    "those authors favour an outside - in star formation in the sense that old ( and metal - poor ) stars tend to be located in the outer disk , whereas younger stars ( also more metal - rich ) tend to inhabit the inner lmc regions .",
    "this age trend with distance , however , is largely restricted to the inner 4 kpc . beyond that , their relation between age and distance is flat , similar to what is found with the lmc clusters studied here .",

    "these are mainly the clusters belonging to the 1.2 gyr age peak .",
    "this young and metal - poor sample is consistent with a recent cluster formation epoch in the outer regions of the lmc sampled in this paper , contrasting a relative low sfr in these areas  @xcite .",
    "this large spread at relatively young ages contrasts with the lack of metal rich clusters at larger ages .",
    "our results are in agreement with , who analyzed a sample of 15 lmc clusters spread all over the galaxy . on the other hand , the field stars amr relation from @xcite lead to higher metallicities at a fixed age than those typically inferred for our sample of outer lmc clusters , at least for ages @xmath134 gyr .",
    "the discrepancy is not caused by the different ranges in distance to the lmc center , since most of our clusters are closer to 8 kpc , similarly to their sample .",
    "this is another example of a discrepancy between results based on field and cluster stars .    in fig .",
    "[ amr2 ] we compare the amr for our sample of outer lmc star clusters to the most accepted models used in literature for the lmc chemical evolution .",
    "briefly , the model from  @xcite is based on a bursting model assuming a constant star formation rate for clusters in the range @xmath135 gyr . in that model , the metallicity increases for clusters younger than 1.6 gyr and this feature reasonably describes the upper metallicity limit for the younger clusters studied here , as well as the old and most metal - poor clusters .",
    "the  @xcite model is based on the starfish analysis code , using bright field stars .",
    "their results describe an initial burst of star formation and a quiescent epoch from approximately 12 to 5 gyr ago .",
    "star formation then resumed and has proceeded until the current time at an average rate of roughly @xmath136 . among the global variations in the recent star formation rate they identify peaks at roughly 2 gyr , 500 myr , 100 myr , and 12 myr .",

    "g , r _ and _ i _ bands to make square cutouts ( with 6.75 arcmin on a side ) around each candidate .",

    "the des - sva1 stellar sample is very incomplete in crowded fields , such as those close to centers of rich lmc star clusters , where desdm detects less than 50% of the objects detected by daophot .",
    "3 .   to reduce stellar incompleteness in crowded fields , we developed a pipeline to reduce data using daophot .",
    "the pipeline combines g and r images and runs psf selection and photometry in a largely automatic way . using stars with good photometry in both catalogs",
    ", we compared the final daophot magnitudes to des - sva1 , determining a zeropoint .",
    "the agreement is very good and on average des - sva1 and daophot photometry agree within 0.02 in g and r bands , without the need for a color term .",
    "we selected stars as sources from daophot reductions with _",
    "g , r , i _ errors @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "we applied a maximum likelihood estimation approach to fit the stellar density profile to a king model @xcite , following a recipe similar to that of  @xcite .",
    "this method is robust to determine center position , core and tidal radii . as output , for each cluster candidate we listed the stars within the tidal radius , along with their probability to belong to cluster candidate ( @xmath142 ) . from the initial sample containing 255 cluster candidates , only 121 had their structural parameters successfully determined by the profile likelihood fit .",
    "we compared the stars with @xmath55 to @xcite isochrones , varying reddening and distance moduli in a two - step refined grid search .",
    "the final grid allows a more refined scan of parameters space around the maximum likelihood estimate peak given by the initial grid .",
    "the uncertainties are estimated from the likelihood distribution around peak .",
    "we used the results from this method for both global and structural parameters .",
    "we tested our inference methods , by inserting simulated cluster stars ( using gencmd ) in a typical lmc field and proceeding through the same steps as for real clusters .",
    "we varied the input number of simulated stars , reaching a minimal number of @xmath143 cluster stars necessary to recover the generating isochrone .",
    "when a threshold on the minimum number of stars is applied , the lmc cluster sample decreases from 121 to 117 clusters , which is the final number of clusters used in the analysis .",

    "the agreement is usually within the uncertainties , with a few exceptions in distance modulus , metallicity and core radii , and an excellent agreement for ages and reddenings .",
    "none of the comparison papers from the literature are based on the same set of parsec isochrones used in this work or even in optical data .",
    "these issues and the variations in methodology , are probably the cause of the discrepancy in the parameters from different authors .",
    "given we are dealing with a homogeneous photometric sample , we conclude that our method is corroborated based on these real data comparisons ( literature and our results ) . 8 .",

    "metal rich clusters ( [ fe / h ] @xmath147 ) are concentrated within r @xmath0 8kpc , whereas the most metal - poor clusters are found over the entire distance range .",
    "the age - metallicity relationship for lmc clusters differs from lmc field stars amr ( from  @xcite ) in the sense that the latter form an upper envelope in metallicity for age distribution .",
    "the same feature is shown in  , as the presence of young clusters ( 1gyr ) filling the range from most metal rich down to [ fe / h ] @xmath2 -1.2 .",
    "regarding the lmc chemical evolution model , our sample shows more young metal - poor clusters than are predicted by the models of  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "apart from this , our results are in broader agreement with the models .",
    "the discovery of 28 previously uncatalogued clusters ( with profiles and models determined here ) is proof that the list of lmc clusters is not complete , mainly in its less scrutinized outskirts .",
    "it is expected that the final des release will provide deeper photometry , reaching further into the clusters ms and decreasing uncertainties for their sgb and rgb stars , even the final release footprint will not cover same sv footprint .",

    ".    the cluster ( and star ) formation rate may be enhanced by tidal gravitational interactions ( in this case , smc - lmc or galaxy - lmc ) . while the gravitational interaction between the galaxy and the lmc is a controversial issue",
    "( see for example  @xcite and  @xcite ) , there is a consensus for the smc - lmc orbit period being @xmath22gyr . in this sense , the age distribution of clusters as shown in fig .",

    "therefore , the relative peak heights provide an estimate of the half - life for these outer lmc clusters . as for the older clusters",
    ", they may result from processes taking place during the early evolution of the host .",
    "a problem of this scenario is that the metallicity predicted for clusters in the aforementioned simulations ( where clusters formed from gas clouds pre - enriched by the formation of field stars ) is higher than for lmc field stars , which is in disagreement with the results presented here .",
    "this discrepancy may be attenuated considering a inefficient gas mixing at the lmc outskirts .",
