    "both spin lasers and their conventional ( spin - unpolarized ) counterparts share three main elements : ( i ) the active ( gain ) region , responsible for optical amplification and stimulated emission , ( ii ) the resonant cavity , and ( iii ) the pump , which injects ( optically or electrically ) energy / carriers . the main distinction of spin lasers is a net carrier spin polarization ( spin imbalance ) in the active region , which , in turn , can lead to crucial changes in their operation , as compared to their conventional counterparts .",
    "this spin imbalance is responsible for a circularly polarized emitted light , a result of the conservation of the total angular momentum during electron - hole recombination.@xcite    the experimental realization of spin lasers@xcite presents two important opportunities .",
    "the lasers provide a path to practical room - temperature spintronic devices with different operating principles , not limited to magnetoresistive effects , which have enabled tremendous advances in magnetically stored information.@xcite this requires revisiting the common understanding of material parameters for desirable operation,@xcite as well as a departure from more widely studied spintronic devices , where only one type of carrier ( electrons ) plays an active role . in contrast , since semiconductor lasers are bipolar devices , a simultaneous description of electrons and holes is crucial .",
    "on the other hand , the interest in spin lasers is not limited to spintronics , as they may extend the limits of what is feasible with conventional semiconductor lasers .",
    "it was experimentally demonstrated that injecting spin - polarized carriers already leads to noticeable differences in the steady - state operation.@xcite the onset of lasing is attained for a smaller injection , lasing threshold reduction , while the optical gain differs for different polarizations of light , leading to gain asymmetry , also referred to as gain anisotropy.@xcite in the stimulated emission , even a small carrier polarization in the active region can be greatly amplified and lead to the emission of completely circularly polarized emitted light , an example of a very efficient spin filtering.@xcite        an intuitive picture for a spin laser is provided by a bucket model in fig .  [",
    "fig : bucket].@xcite the uneven water levels represent the spin imbalance in the laser , which implies the following : ( i ) lasing threshold reduction - in a partitioned bucket , less water needs to be pumped for it to overfill .",
    "there are also two thresholds ( for cold and hot water).@xcite ( ii ) gain asymmetry - an unequal amount of hot and cold water comes out .",
    "a small spin imbalance of pumped carriers can ( the two water levels slightly above and below the opening , respectively ) result in a complete imbalance in the polarization of the emitted light ( here only hot water gushes out ) and , consequently , spin - filtering .",
    "these effects are attained at room temperature with either optical or electrical injection .",
    "the latter experimental demonstration@xcite is a breakthrough towards practical use of spin lasers .",
    "perhaps the most promising opportunity to overcome the limitations of conventional lasers lies in the dynamic operation of spin lasers , predicted to provide enhanced modulation bandwidth , improved switching properties , and reduced parasitic frequency modulation , i. e. , chirp.@xcite moreover , experiments have confirmed that in a given device a characteristic frequency of polarization oscillations of the emitted light can significantly exceed the corresponding frequency of the intensity oscillations.@xcite this behavior was attributed to birefringence - an anisotropy of the index of refraction , considered detrimental in conventional lasers.@xcite    what should we then require to attain high - frequency operation in spin lasers ?",
    "can we provide guidance for the design of an active region and a choice of the resonant cavity ?",
    "unfortunately , to address similar questions , we can not simply rely on the widely used rate - equation description of spin lasers,@xcite but instead we need to formulate a microscopic description .",

[ fig : vcsel_gain](a ) .",

    "the key effect of the active region is producing a stimulated emission and coherent light that makes the laser such a unique light source .",
