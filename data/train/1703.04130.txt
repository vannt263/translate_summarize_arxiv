    "among the @xmath6-family of magnetic superconductors ( r is tm , ho , er , or dy ) , @xmath0 is the only material whose superconducting transition temperature @xmath7 is well below its neel transition temperature @xmath8 . in the absence of an applied magnetic field , it behaves as a conventional superconductor @xcite due to the commensurate antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order , although perhaps with a degree of anisotropy in the superconducting energy gap . besides the averaged superconducting energy gap which satisfies the bcs relation ,",
    "de haas - van alphen measurements have found a small superconducting gap on part of the fermi surface of @xmath9 which is a nonmagnetic analogue of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "as the other @xmath6 , @xmath0 has the body- centered tetragonal crystal structure @xcite and its fermi surface possesses strong nesting for wave vectors in the @xmath10-direction @xcite which for the y- and @xmath11 has the value ( 0.45,0,0 ) .",
    "nevertheless , unlike the er- and ho - compounds modulation only exists over a very small temperature range . ] , in @xmath0 no magnetic ordering along @xmath10-direction is observed @xcite .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction in this group of materials is quite strong and anisotropic which is demonstrated by a softening of the low frequency phonon modes with decreasing the temperature , leading to the appearance of a new narrow phonon line at about @xmath12 in nonmagnetic y- and lu - compounds at @xmath13 @xcite . in spite of previous suggestions about the vital importance of high frequency ( @xmath14 ) boron mode for mediating cooper pairing ,",
    "it was shown @xcite that the low frequency phonon modes ( 4 - 15  @xmath15 ) are more important for the superconductivity mechanism .",
    "especially interesting is the lowest - lying phonon mode at several @xmath15 whose intensity is strongly temperature- and magnetic field - dependent . in y- and lu - compounds , this mode appears to correlate with the superconducting transition @xcite .",
    "although in refs .",
    "@xcite the remanent of this mode in @xmath9 was observed in pc spectra without any traces of superconducting energy gap , it could also be ascribed to superconductivity which was not completely destroyed at fields not far from @xmath16 .    at low energies the crystal electric field excitations ( cef )",
    "are observed in magnetic @xmath6 . in ho - compound",
    "they are studied by fitting the temperature - dependent magnetic susceptibility of singlecrystal @xcite , and in ho- , er- , and tm - compounds by inelastic neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "their energies amount several @xmath15 , and the conduction electrons interact with them strongly .    in the present work",
    ", we find that a similar strong and narrow peak in the electron - quasiparticle interaction ( eqi ) at about few @xmath15 arises for the dy- compound ( @xmath17 ) , starting at a temperature as high as 15  @xmath18 , which is far above the superconducting transition .",
    "this peak presumably has a common origin with cef excitations and magnetic ordering in this compound . in @xmath3 , at the temperature also higher than the transition to the magnetic and superconducting states , a similar peak occurs ( @xmath19 ) @xcite , whose intensity is strongly dependent on magnetic field .",
    "hence , we see that not only the interaction with superconducting order leads to the appearance of strong and narrow phonon mode in the eqi function , but that a same effect may occur from an interaction with the magnetic correlations . the cause for the two may be the strong interaction of conduction electrons with cef and phonon branches of quasiparticle excitations .",
    "point - contact spectroscopy ( pcs ) involves studies of nonlinearities in the current - voltage characteristics of metallic constrictions with characteristic size @xmath20 smaller that the inelastic electron mean free path @xmath21 . at low temperatures ,",
    "the voltage dependence of the differential resistance @xmath22 of a ballistic point contact reflects the energy - dependence of the scattering cross - section of the conduction electrons off any energy dependent scatterers .",
    "consequently , the point - contact spectra [ @xmath23 dependences ] are proportional to the eqi spectral function . in the case of point contacts between dissimilar metals with very different fermi velocities @xmath24 , only the spectrum of the material with smaller @xmath24 is seen @xcite : @xmath25    the function @xmath26 is similar to the eliashberg function .",

    "no heating of the contact occurs .",
    "however , if the contact size is large compared with the electron energy - relaxation length , then there is local heating with the maximum temperature @xmath42 given by the kohlraush relation : @xmath43    for an applied voltage @xmath44 across the contact at the bath temperature @xmath45 . for a typical lorentz number @xmath46 in the thermal regime the einstein oscillator",

    "such a situation holds in the @xmath3 contacts due to the magnetic transition @xcite , and , as we shall see below , in @xmath0 as well .    in the experiment we recorded the second derivative signal @xmath50 vs. the bias voltage @xmath44 . knowing the modulation signal @xmath51 and contact resistance @xmath32 one can write the expressions @xcite : @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 in @xmath55 $ ] are the first and second harmonics of the modulation signal ( rms ) , and @xmath56 is differential resistance in @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "@xmath32 stands for resistance at zero bias .",
    "unfortunately , the application of a magnetic field mechanically destroys the contact , probably because of large magnetostriction .",
    "this effect hinders the study of the influence of magnetic field on the pc spectra .    for a detailed investigation we choose contacts which show clear evidence of a superconducting phase on the surface of @xmath0 single crystal @xcite",
    "this is indicated by a double minimum in the @xmath58 curve due to andreev reflection at @xmath59 when fitting to the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) procedure @xcite .",
    "such a fit yields the superconducting energy gap @xmath60 and critical temperature about 6.2  @xmath18 ( see fig . [ fig1](a ) ) . since the superconducting phase is extremely sensitive to composition and crystal structure , it gives us evidence that the material under the contact is intact .",

    "this singularity points to the nonequilibrium destruction of superconductivity due to heating or an excess concentration of normal quasiparticles . in the normal state , at magnetic fields",
    "greater than @xmath74 @xcite , the positions of the spectral peaks also should not depend upon the contact resistance except the possible change in shape .",
    "the shape of the peak can alter between normal gaussian peaks , as in any pc spectra , and n - type feature which is equivalent to the maximum in @xmath58 .",

    "the latter is due to the `` quasi - thermal '' regime discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for ho - compound .",
    "namely , due to a strong phonon - magnon interaction the effective boson subsystem temperature increases up to the magnetic transition which leads to the step - like increase in resistivity of the metal under the contact and consequently to a n - type singularity in the pc spectra",

    "the pc spectra of eqi of @xmath0 ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) as well as those for @xmath9 , @xmath3 , and @xmath94 @xcite saturate at biases of the order of @xmath14 which point to a considerable electron - phonon interaction at this energy .",
    "nevertheless , no differences were observed between superconducting ( @xmath9 and @xmath3 ) and nonsuperconducting ( @xmath94 ) compounds at biases @xmath93 , while large differences were found at lower energies .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite come to a similar conclusion by comparing neutron spectra of phonons for superconducting and nonsuperconducting pseudoquaternary compounds of the form @xmath95 .",
    "indeed , the electron - phonon - interaction parameter is equal : @xmath96 and in order to have a comparable influence to the strong peaks at about 5 - 10  @xmath15 , the high - frequency boron peak should be at least an order of magnitude more intense .",
    "this is not the case as seen from the lower inset of fig.[fig2 ] which plots the @xmath87-function .",
    "an estimate of @xmath4 gives for the junction of fig.[fig2 ] the value of 0.85 contact was considered , an extra factor of 2 mistakenly was not taken into account in the estimation of @xmath4 . ] which is the highest value measured in our experiments .",
    "one should be cautious with estimates of @xmath4 .",
    "it can be greater than the true electron - phonon - interaction parameter if some `` quasi - thermal '' processes are involved , due to the destruction of magnetic and/or superconducting order .",

    "more typical is the spectrum shown in fig.[fig3 ] , where no `` undershooting '' occurs explicitly . for an approximate estimation of @xmath4 ,",
    "the bias range up to the highest phonon energy ( 160  @xmath15 ) does not matter , since we have seen from the lower inset of fig.[fig2 ] that the higher - bias phonon structure does not influence the magnitude of the integral ( eq.[eq__6 ] ) . here",

    "is observed at noticeably lower energy ( @xmath133 ) which might be hardly explained by phonon excitations since ho and dy have almost the same masses .",
    "the difference in energy positions for the lowest - lying peaks ( fig.[fig6 ] ) also might be ascribed to the influence of cef excitations .    unfortunately , neither the cef energy level scheme extracted from fitting procedure using temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility @xcite , nor the direct inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite were able to find in @xmath3 the cef transition energy of the order of 3 - 4  @xmath15 , although such a transition was found in @xmath147 @xcite .",

    "the difference is that in tm , the magnetic moments are oriented along @xmath108-axis , whereas in ho- and dy - compound along the @xmath33 plane . ]    at the same time , several properties point out that the observed lowest - lying peak is not due to pure phonon excitations",
    ". its intensity and position on the energy scale depend on the temperature and magnetic field ( figs.[fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] , [ fig7 ] , [ fig8 ] ) which is non - typical for phonon excitations . also , the linear background in the pc spectra is not characteristic for scattering by nonequilibrium phonon excitations but looks more like electron - electron interactions @xcite .",
    "thus , we may infer that the lowest - lying peak in the eqi spectral function is influenced by the cef magnetic correlations appearing at @xmath148 and 12  @xmath18 for @xmath0 and @xmath3 , respectively , and not yet observed by neutron scattering @xcite .    in a recent report ,",
    "takeya and kuznietz @xcite observe a small step in dc - magnetization curves for @xmath149 compounds which for @xmath0 gives the temperature of magnetic transition at about @xmath150 .",

    "each ferromagnetically ordered dyc layers are locked antiferromagnetically along the @xmath108-axis in a commensurate fashion .",

    "this would not really have a phase transition at 15  @xmath18 though the effects are dynamic , not static .    by analogy , we may assume that for @xmath3 the corresponding temperature is equal to @xmath141 for magnetic 2d correlations of the ho - moments within each @xmath33 plane separately . since it is very hard to see the modulated magnetic structure above 6  @xmath18 in ho - compounds , the same effect might exists in @xmath0 as well .",
    "it would have an af component and the moment rotating on a cone about it , hence the extended bragg intensity might be searched above 10.6  @xmath18 in @xmath0 .",
    "let us speculate how the lowest - lying peak in the eqi function appears .",
    "we rule out the electron - magnon interaction as a source of 5  @xmath15 peak at temperatures higher than @xmath152 .",
    "the neutron studies of the nonmagnetic compounds @xmath9 and @xmath11 @xcite clearly show that there is a softening of phonon branches at the wave vector of @xmath153 where the fermi surface has a nesting feature @xcite .",
    "this anisotropic anomalous softening leads to the formation of a new strong and narrow phonon mode at @xmath154 due to nonadiabatic effects @xcite which is seen in pc spectra @xcite .",
    "its origin comes from the formation of cooper pairs at the superconducting transition and the opening of the superconducting energy gap in these compounds .",
    "one might speculate that in @xmath0 and @xmath3 we observe the appearance of the analogous phonon mode which is due to a gap ( or quasigap ) in the electron dos caused by the short range magnetic order .",
    "clearly , the superconducting transition which serves as a base for previous theories @xcite can not be invoked as an explanation .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature in @xmath0 is far below the characteristic temperature @xmath151 where this mode appears . also , the superconducting energy gaps both for @xmath0 and @xmath3 are around @xmath155 which is noticeably less than the central energy of this low - lying peak . on the other hand , for a magnetic transition temperature of @xmath156",
    "the mean field value of the magnetic energy gap in the electronic dos fits well the observed position of the low - frequency phonon mode .",
    "unfortunately , although the appearance of a gap ( or quasi gap ) in electron dos near fermi energy should be felt by pcs as a strong nonlinearity near zero bias , it is not observed at all .",
    "thus we can only guess that the reason for strong lowest - lying peaks in pc spectra of @xmath0 and @xmath3 is the interaction of conduction electrons with coupled cef - phonon excitations ( see , for example ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the branch - crossing of low frequency phonons and cef energy levels plus the strong interaction of conduction electrons with cef excitations makes our peaks visible whereas the inelastic neutron magnetic scattering does not feel them .",
    "the strong eqi in @xmath6 materials along definite direction leads to an anisotropy of the energy gap which has not yet been observed in experiment .",
    "an inelastic scattering and pair breaking effect in anisotropic superconductor may reduce the gap - to - critical - temperature ratio to the weak coupling value @xcite .",
    "this may explain why the electron - phonon structure of superconducting @xmath6 has not yet been observed in the tunneling experiments @xcite .",
    "further work is needed to elucidate this issue .",
    "we have found a strong and narrow low - frequency peak ( @xmath1 ) in the eqi function in @xmath0 below @xmath157 . the low - frequency peak shows no change ( in position and intensity ) at the magnetic transition temperatures ( @xmath158 and 6  @xmath18 for @xmath0 and @xmath3 , respectively , and @xmath142 for @xmath3 ) suggesting that its origin is due not to the spin - density wave excitations ( magnons ) , but most probably to phonons coupled with cef magnetic excitons .",
    "this low frequency peak plays a crucial role in determining the magnitude of the eqi parameter , @xmath159 , since it is located at a very low energy . a more detailed account of this peak in the superconductivity mechanism would require a closer theoretical inspection of the effects discussed here .",
