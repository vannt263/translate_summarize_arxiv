    "when ascending parcel of moist air reaches the condensation level , the initial mist of small , micron - size water droplets is formed , which are suspended in the air . in the super - saturated environment water droplets grow due to condensation of water vapor from the surrounding atmosphere .",
    "however , to form the raindrops , which can fall down triggering rain , they must grow up to about 50 @xmath0 m size droplets , which would take a very long time .",
    "observations indicate that the average time for rainfall initiation is approximately @xmath1 minutes , while existing theories predict that the duration of a time interval , required for droplets to grow up to 50 @xmath0 m in radius , is of the order of hours ( see , e.g. , reviews  @xcite , and references therein ) . indeed , though the actual time of large droplets formation depends on the initial droplet size spectrum and cloud water content ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the predicted growth time differs considerably from the observations .",
    "initiation of rain in turbulent clouds comprises three stages .",
    "the first stage involves condensation of water vapor on cloud condensation nuclei ( ccn , typically having a size of the order of 0.05 @xmath0 m ) and formation of small micron size droplets . at the next stage , droplets grow efficiently through condensation and diffusion of water vapor and may attain radii of about 10 @xmath0 m .",
    "it is generally believed that droplets having radii larger than 50 @xmath0 m fall out of the cloud due to gravitational sedimentation and continue to grow in size mainly through gravitational collisions into rain droplets with the size of the order of @xmath2 @xmath0 m .",
    "understanding a mechanism of rapid growth of initially small droplets to the size of the order of 50 @xmath0 m when gravitational collision - coalescence becomes effective is still poorly understood and remains a subject of active research ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "identifying mechanisms of rapid growth of cloud droplets and determining the growth rate , i.e. theoretical explanation of the so - called `` _ _ size gap or the condensation - coalescence bottleneck in warm rain formation _ _ ''",
    "@xcite is one of the major challenges in cloud physics .",
    "observations show the existence of strong turbulence in clouds .",
    "different mechanisms have been suggested and different aspects of turbulence effects on the growth of cloud droplets have been considered to explain the rapid formation of rain droplets in clouds @xcite .",
    "these mechanisms involve e.g. effects of giant aerosol particles for faster formation of large cloud droplets , thereby initiating coalescence sooner @xcite and droplet spectra broadening under conditions of water vapor supersaturation @xcite .",
    "numerous theoretical , numerical and experimental studies used different approaches and models to investigate the effects of atmospheric turbulence on growth of cloud droplets by collision - coalescence and formation of rain droplets ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "most of the studies have focused on amplification of the fall velocity of cloud droplets in turbulent atmosphere and turbulence induced increase of the droplet collision kernel .",
    "air turbulence can enhance droplet coalescence rate by increasing the relative velocity of droplets due to differential acceleration and enhance collision kernel of cloud droplets .",
    "for example , when the dissipation rate of turbulence is increased from 100 to 400 @xmath3 s@xmath4 , the droplet coalescence rate ( between droplets with the sizes 18 @xmath0 m and 20 @xmath0 m ) increases by a factor of 3.5 @xcite . the increase of droplet relative velocity and local accumulation of inertial droplets near the periphery of turbulent eddies due to centrifugal effect , can increase droplet collision rate ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations showed that due to the effect of preferential concentration of inertial particles in turbulent flows their settling rate is about 20%  larger than the terminal fall velocity in the quiescent atmosphere ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this list of references is obviously not complete because the topic is a subject of intense ongoing research and attracts attention of numerous researchers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "accurate modeling of droplet collision - coalescence is important because collisions strongly affect droplet size and velocity distributions , and dispersion of droplets @xcite .",
    "droplet collisions may have numerous outcomes - the droplets might smoothly merge with little deformation , bounce off each other , coalesce following large deformation , or separate after temporarily coalescing .",
    "many of the used droplet interaction models assume that droplet velocities before collisions are not correlated .",
    "however , this assumption is violated in turbulent flows .",
    "indeed , small droplets have low inertia and follow almost the same trajectories as fluid particles and , therefore , their pre - collision velocities are strongly correlated with the velocity of a carrying fluid @xcite .",
    "many of the studies focused on collisions between identical droplets whereby the collision outcome depends on the impact parameter and the ratio of kinetic energy to surface tension .",
    "it was demonstrated that size disparity can significantly increase the parameter range over which droplets permanently coalesce @xcite .",
    "dynamics and interactions of liquid droplets , their collisions , coalescence and bouncing , become more significant with increase of their size and are encountered in many naturally occurring phenomena and industrial applications , including rain initiation and combustion . nevertheless , the collision rate for typical droplet number densities in clouds is too far from being sufficient for their efficient coalescence .",
    "the general opinion is that turbulence somehow enhances droplet collision rate and droplet coalescence .",
    "however , it still remains unclear and not completely established yet to what extent and how turbulence can affect and control droplet coalescence and rain initiation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we explain the fast growth of cloud droplets by collision - coalescence taking into account recently discovered phenomenon of tangling clustering instability of small water droplets in turbulent temperature stratified atmosphere @xcite .",
    "we assume that water droplets coalesce after collisions . however , the ambient mean number density of the droplets is too low , so that their collision - coalescence time is very large .",
    "the situation dramatically changes in the presence of tangling clustering instability which results in the formation of clusters with the mean number density of the droplets inside the clusters that by several orders of magnitude exceeds the ambient mean number density of the droplets .",
    "the mechanism of droplet clustering in turbulence is as follows .",
    "due to inertia effects droplets inside turbulent eddies are carried out to the boundary between the eddies by inertial forces .",
    "therefore , water droplets are locally accumulated in the regions with low vorticity and maximum pressure fluctuations @xcite .",
    "contrary to the inertia induced preferential concentration , the pressure fluctuations in stratified turbulence with a nonzero mean temperature gradient are increased due to additional temperature fluctuations generated by tangling of the mean temperature gradient by velocity fluctuations .",
    "this is a reason why clustering of water droplets is much more effective in stratified turbulence @xcite in comparison with a non - stratified turbulence @xcite .",
    "the tangling clustering instability leads to the formation of clusters , which accumulate surrounding droplets .",
    "since the number density and , correspondingly , the collision - coalescence rate of small droplets inside the clusters drastically increase , the characteristic time of droplet coalescence sharply decreases .",
    "effect of the tangling clustering instability @xcite is much stronger than that of the inertial clustering instability @xcite in non - stratified isotropic and homogeneous turbulence .",
    "the strong enhancement of droplet collision - coalescence rate caused by the effect of tangling clustering instability of small droplets , can explain the observed fast growth of cloud droplets from the initial 1 @xmath0 m size droplets to 40 - 50 @xmath0 m size droplets within 15 - 20 minutes .",
    "small cloud droplets with the size of the order of 1 @xmath0 m have to grow in diameter by a factor 50 - 100 in order to fall out of the cloud as rain droplets",
    ". initial formation of cloud droplets is associated with an intricate process that allows conversion of water vapor into small liquid water droplets .",
    "droplet formation always requires the presence of aerosols and their activation to cloud droplets , and further growth of droplets via condensation - coalescence .",
    "clearly , the growth of cloud droplets is constrained by their vaporization , and droplet collisions and coalescence may modify the droplet size distribution ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the present study we invoke recently discovered phenomenon of tangling clustering instability of droplets in temperature stratified turbulence which causes formation of clusters with the droplet number density inside the clusters by several orders of magnitude larger than the ambient droplet number density @xcite .",
    "the size of the formed clusters is of the order of the kolmogorov micro - scale length . for the sake of simplicity in this section",
    "we assume that vapor condensation produces small droplets of the same size , which then grow due to the collision - induced coalescence .",
    "the droplet size distribution is taken into account in the next section .",
    "the theory of the tangling clustering instability in the temperature - stratified turbulence has been developed in @xcite . in this section",

    "the statistical analysis in @xcite has shown significant deviations from the poisson distribution , which characterizes a random homogeneous spatial distribution of the droplets .",
    "these findings were interpreted in @xcite as appearance of small - scale ( about 1 cm ) droplet clusters in cumulus clouds .",
    "the droplet clusters have been detected in @xcite by analyzing the measurements obtained in situ in 57 clouds by the fast forward - scattering spectrometer probe ( fssp ) .",
    "this finding is the direct evidence of turbulence - inertia impact on droplet motion in clouds .",
    "dissipation rate of the turbulent kinetic energy in clouds was varied in the atmospheric measurements @xcite from @xmath188 to @xmath189 m@xmath190 s@xmath4 .",
    "the rms of small - scale droplet concentration fluctuations was estimated to be about 31 % of the mean values of droplet concentration both over the whole cloud and in a more homogeneous adiabatic core .",
    "the power spectrum shows that fluctuations with spatial scales within the 0.5 - 5 cm range contain over 80 % of the energy of small - scale fluctuations @xcite . an increase in turbulence intensity and droplet inertia result in an increase of the droplet concentration fluctuations .",
    "in other experiments @xcite the droplet positions have been measured with the meteo - france fast forward scattering spectrometer probe .",
    "the cloud droplet data have been collected during a single traverse by the meteo - france merlin iv research aircraft through a cumulus cloud encountered during the small cumulus microphysics study .",
    "the energy dissipation rate was of the order of @xmath188 m@xmath190 s@xmath4 .",

    "the pair correlation function has been obtained in @xcite for droplets in a high reynolds number turbulent flow .",
    "the super - poissonian variances which were detected in these homogeneous core data , were viewed in @xcite as conclusive evidence of clustering .",
    "it was shown in @xcite by using the correlation-fluctuation theorem and the wiener - khinchin theorem , that the pair - correlation function is ideal for quantifying droplet clustering because it contains no scale memory and because of its quantitative link to the poisson process .",
    "simultaneous observations of cloud droplet spatial statistics , cloud droplet size distribution and cloud turbulence were made in @xcite during several cloud passages , including cumulus clouds and a stratus cloud .",
    "the measurements were conducted using the airborne cloud - turbulence observation system ( actos ) which was suspended from a tethered balloon .",

    "the primary finding of the study in @xcite by the determining of the droplet pair correlation function ( with the spatial resolution about @xmath191 m ) is the indication of the droplet clustering even for small stokes numbers ( smaller than @xmath192 and also in weakly turbulent clouds ( with the dissipation rate of the turbulent kinetic energy that is smaller than @xmath193 m@xmath190 s@xmath4 ) . for three analyzed cases , two horizontal passages through cumulus clouds and vertical profiles through a stratus cloud ,",
    "the regions where droplets are clustered at sub - cm scales , have been found in @xcite .",
    "all these studies for the most part show very modest clustering at kolmogorov separations and below .",
    "note , however , that the fssp measures droplets along a narrow almost 1-d horizontal path through a cloud volume , which means that a long sample is necessary to construct a reasonable spectrum @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the results remains controversial because deviations from poisson distributions could be possible due to instrumental artefacts and the necessarily limited samples that are obtained from aircraft measurements , which inevitably compromise the assumption of the statistical homogeneity of the sample @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the detailed measurements during all these atmospheric cloud experiments of the spatial temperature distributions and of the vertical and horizontal heat fluxes in clouds have not been presented in the papers discussing the droplet clustering .",

    "it must be emphasized that the pair correlation function @xmath194 for clustered droplet population measured in @xcite ( see fig",

    "this value of the ratio @xmath200 agrees with the estimated value 470 obtained in @xcite . to determine the pair correlation function in the scales much smaller than the kolmogorov scale , the spatial resolution of the atmospheric measurements reported in @xcite",

    "in this section we consider droplet coagulation and apply the theory of the tangling clustering instability to explain acceleration of raindrops formation in warm clouds .",
    "the warm clouds often exist in the region of atmospheric turbulent convection with coherent structures ( cloud `` cells '' in shear - free convection and cloud `` streets '' in sheared convection , see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the vertical large - scale temperature gradient is small inside the large - scale circulation ( coherent structures ) in a small - scale turbulent convection .",
    "however , the horizontal large - scale temperature gradient inside the circulations is not small .",
    "atmospheric observations showed that this gradient is about 1 k per 100 m @xcite .",
    "similar results were reported in laboratory experiments where the horizontal large - scale temperature gradient inside the large - scale circulation was 0.6 k per 1 cm , while the vertical large - scale temperature gradient was 0.05 k per 1 cm @xcite .",
    "this magnitude of the horizontal temperature gradient is sufficient for the generation of strong temperature fluctuations in the stratified turbulence by tangling mechanism .",
    "the initial stage of cloud droplets formation involves condensation of water vapor on cloud condensation nuclei ( ccn ) and formation of small micron size droplets . in the present study",
    "we show that the tangling clustering instability strongly enhances the growth rate of cloud droplets at both stages : at the first stage when droplets grow from the micron size to 10 @xmath0 m droplets and at the next stage from 10 to 50 @xmath0 m radius droplets .",
    "subsequent evolution and growth of small droplets due to collision - coalescence depend on the interplay between their collision time and evaporation time , in particular because of water vapor depletion .",
    "the collision time of small droplets can be determined using the smoluchowski coagulation equation ( see , e.g. , @xcite , chapter 13 ) : @xmath215 where @xmath216 , @xmath217 is the droplet size distribution , @xmath218 is number density of droplets , and @xmath219 is the coagulation kernel that describes coagulation rate of droplets of the diameter @xmath8 and droplets of the diameter @xmath220 . in the present study we use the coagulation kernel @xmath219 as a sum of the brownian coagulation kernel ( see table 13.1 , p. 600 in @xcite ) and the gravitational coagulation kernel ( see eq .",
