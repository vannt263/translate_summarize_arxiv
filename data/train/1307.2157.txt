    "the evolution of the density of a test particle moving in a configuration of obstacles is described at mesoscopic level by linear kinetic equations .",
    "they are obtained from the microscopic hamiltonian dynamics under a kinetic scaling of space and time , namely @xmath0 , @xmath1 and a suitable rescaling of the density of the obstacles and the intensity of the interaction . accordingly to the resulting frequency of collisions , the mean free path of the particle can have or not macroscopic length and different kinetic equations arise .",
    "typical examples are the linear boltzmann equation and the linear landau equation",
    ".    the first rigorous result appeared in 1969 in the paper of gallavotti @xcite , who derived a linear boltzmann equation starting from a random distribution of fixed hard scatterers in the boltzmann - grad limit ( low density ) , namely when the number of collisions is small , thus the mean free path of the particle is macroscopic .",
    "the result was improved by spohn @xcite . in the weak - coupling regime ,",
    "when there are very many but weak collisions , a linear landau equation appears @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the laplace - beltrami operator on the @xmath4-dimensional sphere of radius @xmath5 .",
    "it describes a momentum diffusion , i.e. the velocity process is a brownian motion on the ( kinetic ) energy sphere .",
    "this intuitively follows from the facts that there are many elastic collisions with obstacles isotropically distributed .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath6 is proportional to the variance of the transferred momentum in a single collision and depends on the shape of the interaction potential .",
    "the first result in this direction was obtained by kesten and papanicolau in 1978 for a particle in @xmath7 and by drr , goldstein and lebowitz in 1987 for a particle in @xmath8 for sufficiently smooth interaction potentials .",
    "the linear landau equation yields also in an intermediate scale between low density and weak - coupling regime , namely when the ( smooth ) interaction potential @xmath9 rescales according to @xmath10 , @xmath11 and the density of the obstacles is of order @xmath12 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the limiting cases @xmath13 and @xmath14 correspond respectively to the low density limit and the weak - coupling limit .    in the present paper",
    "we want to investigate the limit @xmath15 in the intermediate case , namely when @xmath16 but sufficiently small , for an interaction potential no more smooth given by a circular potential barrier , in dimension two .",
    "the physical interest of this problem is connected to the geometric optics since the trajectory of the test particle is that of a light ray traveling in a medium ( say water ) in presence of circular drops of a different substance with smaller refractive index ( say air ) .",
    "the opposite situation , namely drops of water in a medium of air , can be described as well by the circular well potential .",
    "our analysis applies also to this case with minor modifications , but we consider only the case of potential barrier for sake of concreteness .",
    "the novelty of this choice is that in this case the diffusion coefficient @xmath6 diverges logarithmically . roughly speaking ,",
    "the asymptotic equation for the density of the lorentz particle reads @xmath17 which suggests to look at a longer time scale @xmath18 .",
    "as expected , a diffusion in space arises .",
    "the proof follows the original constructive idea , due to gallavotti @xcite , for the low - density limit of a hard - sphere system .",
    "this approach is based on a suitable change of variables which leads to a markovian approximation described by a linear boltzmann equation .",
    "this presents some technical difficulties since some of the random configurations lead to trajectories that `` remember '' too much preventing the markov property of the limit . in the two - dimensional case",
    "the probability of those bad behaviors producing memory effects ( correlation between the past and the present ) is nontrivial .",
    "thus we need to control the unphysical trajectories : we estimate explicitly the set of bad configurations of the scatterers ( such as the set of configurations yielding recollisions or interferences ) showing that it is negligible in the limit ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the control of memory effects still holds for a longer time scale @xmath19 which allows to get the heat equation from the rescaled linear boltzmann equation . + we remark that the diffusive limit analyzed in the present paper is suggested by the divergence of the diffusion coefficient for the particular choice of the potential we are considering .",
    "however the same techniques could work in presence of a smooth , radial , short - range potential @xmath9 .",
    "also in this case we obtain a diffusive equation as longer time scale limit of a linear boltzmann equation ( section 5 ) .",
    "this is in the same spirit of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "consider a point particle of mass one in @xmath8 , moving in a random distribution of fixed scatterers whose center are denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "the equation of motion are @xmath21 where @xmath22 denote position and velocity of the test particle , @xmath23 the time and , as usual , @xmath24 indicates the time derivative for any time dependent variable @xmath25 . +",
    "finally @xmath26 is a given spherically symmetric potential .",
    "+ to outline a kinetic behavior of the particle , we usually introduce a scale parameter @xmath27 , indicating the ratio between the macroscopic and the microscopic variables , and rescale according to @xmath28 with @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "then eq.ns become @xmath30 we assume the scatterers @xmath31 distributed according to a poisson distribution of intensity @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",

    "as we shall prove in section 4 , the asymptotic behavior of the mechanical system we are considering is the same as the markov process ruled by the linear landau equation with a diverging factor in front of @xmath85 .",
    "this is equivalent to consider the limit in the euler scaling of the linear landau equation , which is trivial .",
    "the system quickly thermalizes to the local equilibrium just given by @xmath86 .",
    "this is point 1 ) .    to detect something non - trivial we have to exploit longer times in which the local equilibrium starts to evolve ( according to the diffusion equation ) , see point 3 ) .",
    "note however that , rescaling differently the density of the poisson process , we can recover the kinetic picture given by landau equation ( with a renormalized diffusion coefficient @xmath6 ) as in @xcite , see point 2 ) .",
    "we finally remark that this picture is made possible because the recollisions set ( see below for the precise definition ) is negligible , as established in section 4 .",
