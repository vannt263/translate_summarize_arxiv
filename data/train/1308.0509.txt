    "the literature about optimal stopping problems and their applications is immense . in an infinite horizon problem , with one - dimensional continuous diffusions as the state variable ,",
    "a full characterization of the value function and of optimal stopping rule is known and the methodology for solution has been established .",
    "see , for example , dynkin @xcite , alvarez @xcite , dayanik and karatzas @xcite . for _",
    "spectrally negative lvy processes _ , or lvy processes with only negative jumps , a number of authors have succeeded in extending the classical results by using the scale functions .",
    "we just name a few here : @xcite for stochastic games , @xcite for the optimal dividend problem , @xcite for american and russian options , and @xcite for credit risk .",
    "however , the solution techniques presented in each paper are more or less problem - specific and no characterization of the value function is yet known .",
    "if the problem involves _ two _ state variables , then even for continuous diffusions , very few things are known in the literature .",
    "we study a new type of optimal stopping problems .",
    "we let @xmath6 be a spectrally negative lvy process and denote by @xmath7 the reflected process @xmath8 where @xmath9 } x_u\\vee s$ ] .",
    "we then consider an optimal stopping problem for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 in which the absorbing boundary is defined by @xmath10 with @xmath3 as a positive constant .",
    "this means that while @xmath0 grows and keeps attaining new maxima , the absorbing boundary is accompanying with @xmath1 .",
    "hence an excursion from @xmath1 , if greater than @xmath3 , would bring @xmath0 to ruin .",
    "this situation is seen in the real world ; for example , several large financial institutions failed in the last crisis in 2007 - 2008 .",
    "one of the reasons is that , while becoming large banks , they maintain high leverage and accordingly , the banks are not so far way from the bankruptcy threshold .",
    "instead , the bankruptcy threshold keeps up with the size of the banks . that is , despite the size of the bank , the risk of bankruptcy is not so much mitigated .",
    "this paper is motivated by this phenomenon .",
    "see section [ sec : bank - example ] for details .",
    "while we take the example of banking , one can come up with other applications of this type , as long as the absorbing boundary is determined in relation to the state process running maxima .",
    "for instance , a gambler may have a policy that he stops betting when his wealth @xmath0 goes below a certain level @xmath3 from that day s running maxima @xmath1 .",
    "an excursion theory for spectrally negative lvy processes has been developed recently .",
    "see bertoin @xcite as a general reference .",
    "more specifically , an exit problem of the reflected process @xmath7 was studied by avram et al .",
    "@xcite , pistorius @xcite @xcite and doney @xcite .    in the above cited papers on optimal stopping problems , the optimal strategy",
    "is usually obtained by so - called  threshold strategy \" .",
    "that is , the player should stop and receive rewards on the first occasion when the state process enters a stopping region . in lvy and other jump models ,",
    "the authors first find the optimal threshold level and then prove its optimality by verifying the ` quasi - variational inequalities ' .",
    "see ksendal and sulem @xcite . since the problem at hand involves two dimensions ; one is @xmath0 and the other is @xmath1 , finding and proving the overall optimal strategy may be challenging ( as mentioned , no characterization in two - dimensional problems has been found ) .",
    "recent developments on two - dimensional optimal stopping problems ( involving @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) include ott @xcite and guo and zervos @xcite . in the former paper",
    ", the author solves problems including a capped version of the shepp - shiryaev problem @xcite , and the latter paper is another contribution that extends @xcite .    in our particular situation , by looking at excursions that occur at each level of @xmath1 , we reduce the problem to an infinite number of one - dimensional optimal stopping problems",
    ". we shall then find an explicit form of the solution , thanks to the results by pistorius @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the optimal stopping region can be shown in a diagram created by various values of @xmath1 and @xmath4 ( e.g. , figure [ l(m)_(x , s ) ] ) .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we formulate a mathematical model with a review of some important facts of spectrally negative lvy processes , and then find an optimal threshold level in section [ sec : solution ] .",

    "when @xmath53 is constant , for example , @xmath54 on @xmath55 , we write @xmath56 in particular , if @xmath57 , then @xmath58 .",
