    "it is convenient to choose a specific bulk metric of the form ( [ metric ] ) satisfying six dimensional einstein equations .",
    "this is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 with @xmath21 ( @xmath22 being the cosmological constant ) and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are constants . we should notice that @xmath25 is a compactified coordinate .",
    "this metric contains a singularity located at @xmath26 and it is valid on the @xmath27 parts of surfaces of constant @xmath3 , and its reflection , by the @xmath28 orbifold symmetry , is valid on the @xmath29 parts . if @xmath30 and @xmath31 , then ( [ bhmetric ] ) is simply the metric of de sitter or anti de sitter spacetime according to the sign of @xmath32 .    with this ansatz the israel conditions ( [ israel ] )",

    "we consider two points on the brane @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "in general there are more than one null geodesics connecting them in the @xmath36 spacetime .",
    "the trajectories of photons must be on the brane and those of gravitons may be outside .",
    "the graviton path is defined equating ( [ bhmetric ] ) to zero .",
    "since we are looking for a path that minimizes @xmath3 when the final point @xmath35 is on the brane , the problem reduces to an euler - lagrange problem @xcite .",
    "then as in @xcite the shortest graviton path is given by @xmath37    the time delay of the photon traveling on the brane with respect to the gravitons traveling in the bulk measured by an observer on the brane can approximately be written as @xcite @xmath38    it is also interesting to look at the ratio between the horizons subtended by the photons traveling on the brane and the gravitons traveling in the bulk , @xmath39    @xmath40",
    "the system ( [ brem ] ) describing the brane dynamics can be numerically solved for several combinations of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath41 and @xmath32 .",
    "when @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath41 vanish , the solution for @xmath42 is a constant or a linear function in @xmath3 depending on the given initial condition for @xmath43 .    for @xmath23 and @xmath24 non - zero we have solved ( [ brem ] ) in the typical cases of a domain wall ( @xmath44 ) , matter ( @xmath45 ) and radiation ( @xmath46 ) dominated branes . in fig.[hh ] we show all the possible forms of @xmath47 due to @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath41 and @xmath32 combinations , which we study in this section .",

    "we have classified all cases according to the sign of the @xmath23 parameter and to whether we are in ds or ads bulks .",
    "moreover , we studied the zero charge black hole as well as the reissner - nordstrm - type solutions , namely 8 cases . in tables",

    "in the present work we have studied the behavior of a brane embedded in a six dimensional de sitter or anti de sitter spacetime containing a singularity .",
    "the system of equations describing this behavior from the point of view of an observer in the bulk appears to be highly non - linear .    by solving the full non - linear system we found different behaviors for the several scenarios appearing due to all the combinations of @xmath23",

    "the results show branes getting away from the singularity , falling into it , converging to cosmological horizons when they exist or even bouncing between a minimum and maximum values .",
    "the bouncing behavior is not surprising since in 5 dimensions a similar behavior has been obtained in recent investigations @xcite , where universes bouncing from a contracting to an expanding phase without encountering past and/or future singularities appear . in this way these results could provide support for a singularity - free cosmology or to the so - called cyclic universe scenarios @xcite .",
    "finally , we also studied the geodesic behavior .",
    "contrarily to the case of a static brane , where shortcuts appeared under very restrictive conditions @xcite , the present model of a dynamic brane embedded in a static bulk displays shortcuts in almost all cases and under very mild conditions .",
    "moreover , despite the fact that the time delay between graviton and photon flight time is not percentually so big as in other models @xcite ( what is also evident from the ratio between graviton and photon horizons ) , it exists and can eventually be measured by the brane observer , although further considerations are certainly needed in a stricter realistic model . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that shortcuts are abundant in the studied setups lends further support to the idea of solving the horizon problem via thermalization by graviton exchange @xcite , however , we should stress that this is not a proof of the solution of the problem yet ."
