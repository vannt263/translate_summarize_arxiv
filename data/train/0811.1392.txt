    "the development of atomic force microscopy and optical tweezers has allowed experimentalists to micro - manipulate individual polymer molecules ( _ _ e.g .  _ _ bemis _ et al .  _",
    "( 1999 ) , haupt _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 2002 ) , gunari _ et al .  _",
    "( 2007 ) ) , and this has led to a considerable body of theoretical work describing the response of a polymer to an applied force ( _ _ e.g .  _ _ halperin and zhulina  ( 1991 ) , cooke and williams ( 2003 ) , rosa _ et al .  _",
    "( 2003 ) ) .",
    "several situations have been investigated , including pulling a polymer off a surface at which it is adsorbed , pulling a polymer from a preferred solvent to a less preferred solvent , pulling a copolymer which is localized at an interface between two immiscible liquids , and pulling a collapsed polymer ( in a poor solvent ) to an extended form . in this paper",
    "we shall be concerned with the latter problem .",
    "the stress - strain curve of a linear polymer in a poor solvent , being pulled in an afm experiment , has been measured by several groups ( haupt _ _ et al .",
    "_ _ 2002 , gunari _ _ et al .",
    "_ _ 2007 ) .",
    "the force - extension curve shows a characteristic plateau . for forces below this critical value the polymer will be in a collapsed state , while for forces above the critical value the polymer will be stretched . the plateau region would seem to indicate a first - order phase transition .",
    "indeed grassberger and hsu ( 2002 ) have studied self - avoiding walks with nearest - neighbour attraction and an applied force at low temperatures ( poor solvents ) : they predicted a first - order phase transition in three dimensions . on the other hand , they see no sign of a first - order transition in two dimensions .    a well - studied exactly solved model of poor solvent polymers is the self - interacting partially directed self - avoiding walk model ( ipdsaw ) .",
    "we begin our discussion by noting that a partially directed self - avoiding walk on the square lattice without self - interaction is intrinsically anisotropic with a preferred direction so that the polymer s size scales proportionally to its length , and one perpendicular to this so that the polymer s size in this direction scales sub - linearly",
    ". as we shall consider the square lattice with the polymer oriented one way , the preferred direction will be the _ horizontal _ direction and the other direction will be the _ vertical _ direction .    in the absence of an applied force the critical point of this model",
    "was found by binder _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1990 ) , and is expected to model the polymer collapse transition ( or @xmath0-point ) .",
    "the exact solution of the generating function was found by brak _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1992 ) and its singularity structure was rigorously elucidated .",
    "et al _ ( 1993 ) used recurrence relations to generate very long series to estimate the exponents and the scaling function for the phase transition . a second - order phase transition similar to the @xmath0-point",
    "was found .",
    "the tricritical nature of this transition was described by owczarek _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1993 ) based upon small parameter expansions and calculations of a related version of the model ( see below ) .",
    "various calculations were made by owczarek _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1993 ) that are worth noting .",
    "firstly a semi - continuous version of the model was solved explicitly , building on works by zwanzig and lauritzen ( 1968 and 1970 ) on a related model , and showed the same tricritical nature ( identical exponents ) as the lattice model ( from the small parameter expansion and the numerical work of prellberg _ et al .  _",
    "( 1993 ) ) .",
    "a later calculation by prellberg ( 1995 ) on the asymptotics of the generating function of the lattice model of staircase polygons enumerated by perimeter and area implicitly demonstrated that the scaling function and the exponents were also the same as in the fully discrete model : the @xmath1-bessel functions involved are the same in the two lattice models .",
    "this was made explicit recently by owczarek and prellberg ( 2007 ) .",
    "the low temperature scaling of the partition function was found by owczarek ( 1993 ) in the semi - continuous model , and once again this was the same as found by prellberg _",
    "et al _ ( 1993 ) numerically for the fully discrete case .",
    "we argue below that the uniform asymptotic expansion given by owczarek and prellberg ( 2007 ) implies that they are indeed similar .",
    "secondly , owczarek _ et al .  _",
    "( 1993 ) generalised the fully discrete model to include a parameter that counts the horizontal span of the walks .",
    "the generating function was found by generalising the approach of brak _ et al .  _",
    "( 1992 ) for the no - force case .",
    "this added parameter is equivalent to considering a force applied in the preferred direction .",
    "the semi - continuous model also contained this parameter . in the semi - continuous model it was clear that this parameter did not change the nature of the transition .",
    "in the discrete model it was also implicit that the collapse transition was unchanged by this parameter ( and confirmed by the work of prellberg ( 1995 ) ) , and so unchanged by such an applied force .",
    "the connection to an applied force was however not made explicit in the paper .",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 2003 ) studied the model numerically with the connection made explicit , and added the consideration of the end - to - end distance scaling function for the discrete model , corroborating the unchanged tricritical nature of the transition when an applied force in the preferred direction is added .",
    "they also plotted the critical - force - against - temperature curve for the discrete and semi - continuous models .",
    "again the work of owczarek and prellberg ( 2007 ) makes this conclusion explicit .",
    "thirdly , in the appendix of owczarek _ et al .  _",
    "( 1993 ) a further generalisation of the model was considered and the full generating function of this further generalisation evaluated exactly . in this generalisation",
    "the parameter for vertical steps was replaced by two parameters : one for steps in the positive vertical direction and one for steps in the negative vertical direction .",
    "no analysis of this generating function was attempted .",
    "we note that a recent paper by kumar and giri ( 2007 ) considered pulling in both directions though their focus was on finite size effects calculated numerically rather than thermodynamic transitions and exact results .    in this paper",
    "we make explicit the connection to applying a force in the vertical ( non - preferred ) direction of the generalisation discussed above .",
    "however we go further and solve for the generating function along the surface in the parameter space which should include the transition point .",
    "hence we find an explicit expression for the phase transition point and so are able to plot exactly the critical force against temperature curve .",
    "we also observe that one of the tricritical exponents is unchanged when this non - preferred force is applied .",
    "this indicates , though does not prove , that the transition may remain second - order even in the case of this type of force .",
    "this is a little unexpected as the force must change the end - to - end scaling of the high temperature phase when pulling in the vertical direction from sub - linear to linear , which it does not when applied in the horizontal direction .",
    "we also derive functional equations for the generating function and show how the solution of this general class of problem can be streamlined with this approach .",
    "before we explain our work on the vertical pulling problem we summarise all the known results on the horizontal pulling problem making explicit the results in terms of the applied force .",
    "moreover , we apply the rigorous techniques of brak _ et al .  _",
    "( 1992 ) , which had only been applied to the case of no applied force , to the horizontal pulling problem .",
    "in addition we discuss the behaviour of the force - extension curves based upon the exact results .",
    "essentially we bring together all the known results and extend them as necessary for the case of horizontal pulling of a partially directed polymer in two dimensions .    at the end of this paper",
    "we consider a three - dimensional analogue of the model and show it has similar behaviour to its two - dimensional counterparts .",
    "[ model ]    consider the square lattice and a self - avoiding walk that has one end fixed at the origin on that lattice .",
    "now restrict the configurations considered to self - avoiding walks such that starting at the origin only steps in the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions are permitted : such a walk is known as a partially directed self - avoiding walk ( pdsaw ) . for convenience , we consider walks that have their first step in the horizontal direction .",
    "let the total number of steps in the walk be @xmath5 .",
    "we label the vertices of the walk @xmath6 .",
    "let the number of horizontal steps be @xmath7 and the number of vertical steps be @xmath8 . to define our model we will need finer definitions , so let us define @xmath9 to be the number of @xmath3 steps ( positive vertical steps ) and @xmath10 to be the number of @xmath4 steps ( negative vertical steps ) .",
    "if the walk starts at the origin let the position of the other end - point be @xmath11 so that the _ span _ in the horizontal direction is @xmath12 and the _ span _ of the walk in the vertical direction is @xmath13 .",
    "we therefore have @xmath14 and @xmath15    an example configuration along with the associated variables of our model is illustrated in figure  [ fig - model ] .     with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 and having six nearest - neighbour ` contacts ' ( shown as intertwined ( red ) curves ) so @xmath19 .",
    "the horizontal span is @xmath20 while the vertical span is @xmath21 .",
    "one end is fixed at the origin while forces are applied to the other end ( horizontal  @xmath22 and vertical  @xmath23).,width=453 ]    to define our model we add various energies and hence boltzmann weights to the walk .",
    "first , any two occupied sites of the walk not adjacent in the walk though adjacent on the lattice are denoted _ nearest - neighbour contacts _ or _",

    "an energy @xmath24 is added for each such contact .",
    "we define a boltzmann weight @xmath25 associated with these contacts , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the absolute temperature . without loss of generality",
    "we shall take the units of energy to be such that @xmath28 and therefore @xmath29 , except when we discuss pulling polymers without any self - interaction ( @xmath30 ) where we will have @xmath31 .",
    "an external horizontal force @xmath22 pulling at the other end of the walk adds a boltzmann weight @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "an external vertical force @xmath23 pulling at the other end of the walk adds a boltzmann weight @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "the partition function @xmath36 of the model for walks of length @xmath37 , where for later mathematical convenience the first step of the walk is a horizontal step , is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of nearest - neighbour contacts in the pdsaw , @xmath40 .",
    "the generating function @xmath41 is @xmath42 so @xmath43 can be considered as a fugacity for the steps of the walk and the generating function as a `` generalised partition function '' .",

    "<S> we show which of the techniques available can be extended to the full model , where the force has components in the preferred direction and the direction perpendicular to this . whilst the solution of the generating function is available </S>",
    "<S> , its analysis is far more complicated and not all the rigorous techniques are available . </S>",
    "<S> however , many results can be extracted including the location of the critical point which gives the general critical - force temperature curve . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we generalise the model to a three - dimensional analogue and show that several key properties can be analysed if the force is restricted to the plane of preferred directions . </S>"
