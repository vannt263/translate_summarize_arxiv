    "blazars , as a subset of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , are characterized by rapid and strong variability , and are those objects with their relativistic jets pointed basically toward the observer @xcite .",
    "the jet is believed to originate from and be accelerated by a rotating supermassive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk .",
    "blazars can be divided into two groups : bl lac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsqr ) the former ones show no or very weak emission lines in their optical spectra , while the latter ones show strong emission lines .",
    "the bl lac object oj 287 is one of the best - observed blazars .",
    "it is also the only blazar which shows convincing period of 12 years in optical regime @xcite . in order to explain the 12-year period , sillanp et al .",
    "( 1988 ) proposed a binary black hole model for this object .",
    "later observations found a double - peaked structure for the periodic outburst and led other workers to establish new models , but all based on a binary black hole system @xcite .",
    "the color behavior of oj 287 during outburst was investigated by sillanp et al .",
    "they found that the object showed a stable @xmath0-@xmath1 color from 1994 to 1996 .",
    "however , their color were calculated by using the average magnitudes over one day . since the brightness of this object might change on intraday timescales , using the average brightness will dilute the color change , especially that on short timescales . in order to find out the genuine color",
    ", we revisited the data from the oj-94 monitoring project and used our own data to figure out the relationship between the color and magnitude of this object .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the revisit of oj-94 data is described in section 2 .",
    "section 3 presents our monitoring and results .",
    "section 4 shows the simulations of the color behavior resulted from different amplitudes and different paces of the variations at different wavelengths .",
    "the conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "in order to verify the predicted optical outburst of oj 287 in late 1994 @xcite , an international , multi - waveband project was launched .",
    "this is the oj-94 project .",
    "it started in 1993 autumn and ended in 1997 .",
    "more than 50 workers from 10 countries were involved .",
    "the monitoring was carried out at multiple wavelengths in the uv , optical , infrared , and radio regimes . as a result ,",
    "over 8,000 data were collected during the monitoring period .",
    "as mentioned in section 1 , the brightness of oj 287 might change during one day , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "other cases of intraday variability ( idv ) in oj 287 were reported by carini et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . when the magnitude of an object has little change in one day , it is possible to use the average magnitude over that time to calculate the color .",
    "but when the magnitude changes obviously on short timescales , it is not a correct way to calculate the color using the average magnitude . in order to get the genuine color , we reprocessed the data of oj-94 in two ways :    the first one was direct match .",
    "if the time interval of a @xmath0 and a @xmath1 magnitude is less than five minutes , they were matched and a color was computed .",
    "if one magnitude has multiple matches , the one with the smallest time interval was used .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram is given in figure 2 . in principle , the direct match is the most reasonable way to calculate the color .",
    "however , this way might be biased by the possible small systematic differences between different telescopes involved in the oj-94 project .",
    "then we used a second way to calculate the color of oj 287 .",
    "the second one was binning and match .",
    "the data were binned in half an hour , and then the binned @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes were used to compute the color .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram is displayed in figure 3 .",
    "the binning of the data helped to eliminate or reduce the possible systematic differences between different telescopes .",
    "the binning time of half an hour was chosen just because the variability timescale of most blazars is longer than that time , except for a few cases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we used the linear least square method to calculate the interdependency and got that the slope in figure 2 is 0.02868 , with a correlation coefficient of 0.3022 and the significance level is 0.05 .",
    "the slope in figure 3 is 0.01818 , with a correlation coefficient of 0.2138 and the significance level is 0.05 . for a comparison , the slope of sillanp et al .",
    "( 1996 ) is just 0.00967 by converting their result from the slope of @xmath0-@xmath1 diagram .",
    "therefore , we revisited the oj-94 data and used two new ways to calculate the color of oj 287 .",
    "the object was found to have a bluer - when - brighter chromatism during its outburst in 1994 - 96 .",
    "this is different from and should be more reasonable than the result drawn by sillanp et al .",
    "our optical monitoring program of oj 287 was performed with a 60/90 cm schmidt telescope located at the xinglong station of the national astronomical observatories of china ( naoc ) .",
    "prior to 2006 , there is a ford aerospace 2048@xmath22048 ccd camera mounted at its main focus .",
    "the ccd has a pixel size of 15 @xmath3 m , and its field of view is 58@xmath458 , resulting in a resolution of 17 pixel@xmath5 . at the beginning of 2006 ,",
    "the 2k ccd was replaced by a new 4096@xmath24096 ccd .",
    "the field of view becomes 96@xmath296 , resulting in a resolution of 17 pixel@xmath5 .",
    "the telescope is equipped with a 15 color intermediate - band filters , covering a wavelength range from 3000 to 10,000  .",
    "this paper includes data from 2005 january 29 to 2009 april 13 . except for the nights with bad weather and those nights for other targets ,",
    "the actual number of nights with oj 287 observations is 234 . for the vast majority of nights",
    ", only one or two exposures were made in each band . on only a few nights , more exposures were made for idv search .",
    "we used filters in @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 bands to observe in 2005 - 06 , and then changed to @xmath9 , @xmath1 , and @xmath10 bands from the end of 2006 december . at the beginning of 2009",
    ", the @xmath1 band was changed back to the @xmath7 band .",
    "the wavelengths of @xmath9 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath10 bands are 4210 , 4920 , 6660 , 8020 , and 9190  , respectively . the @xmath1-band data has been published by villforth et al .",
    "the data at other wavelengths are reported here .",
    "the data reduction procedures include positional calibration , bias subtraction , flat - fielding , extraction of instrumental aperture magnitude , and flux calibration .",
    "the average fwhm of stellar images was about 35 during our monitoring .",
    "so during the extraction , the radius of the aperture was adopted as 3 pixels and the radii of sky annulus were adopted as 7 and 10 pixels respectively .",
    "we used the comparison stars 4 , 10 , and 11 in fiorucci and tosti ( 1996 ) for the flux calibration of oj 287 .",
    "their batc @xmath9 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath10 magnitudes were obtained by observing them and three batc standard stars hd 19445 , hd 84937 , and bd + 17 4708 on a photometric night and are listed in table 1 .",
    "then the magnitude of oj 287 was calibrated with respect to the average brightness of stars 4 and 10 .",
    "the star 11 acted as a check star .",
    "its differential magnitudes were calculated relative to the average brightness of star 4 and 10 for a check of the accuracy of the observations . the observational log and results",
    "are given in tables 2 to 6 .",
    "the columns are observation date and time in universal time , julian date , exposure time in second , magnitude and error of oj 287 , and differential magnitude of star 11 ( its nightly averages were set to be zero ) .      the light curves are shown in figure 4 . the data in the @xmath1 band are also plotted here for a comparison . generally , the light curves show a double - peak outburst .",
    "the first outburst occurred in the period from 2005 november 5 ( jd 2,453,680 ) to 2005 december 24 ( jd 2,453,729 ) .",
    "it contains two sub - peaks .",
    "the second one was not well identified by villforth et al .",
    "( 2010 ) due to their sparse time coverage during that period .",
    "the second outburst , from 2007 october 13 ( jd 2,454,387 ) to 2008 january 18 ( jd 2,454,484 ) , also contains some sub - peaks , with the highest peak appeared on 2007 november 28 ( jd 2,454,433 ) .",
    "the time of the second outburst is consistent with the predictions of different models @xcite , but the time of the first outburst has been advanced , which can be explained as that the precession shifts the first outburst of each outburst season progressively to earlier times relative to the mean period @xcite . both of the outbursts contain some sub - peaks , similar to the outburst in 1994 - 96 , which can be explained by the impact - tidal effects @xcite , especially for the two sub - peaks of the first outburst .",
    "the first sub - peak occurred because the secondary black hole impact the accretion disk of the primary black hole @xcite , while the second one was the tidal effect , i.e. , tidally induced accretion flow would enhance the emission from the jet .    from 2005 january 29 to 2006 november 19 , the overall amplitude in @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 band is 2.34 , 2.24 , and 2.14 mags , respectively .",
    "and the overall amplitude in @xmath9 , @xmath1 , and @xmath10 band from 2006 november 26 to 2009 january 9 is 2.64 , 2.59 , and 2.55 mags , respectively .",
    "the amplitude of variation tends to decrease with the decrease of frequency .",
    "no idv was found for oj287 on the very limited nights devoted to idv search .",
    "the color behavior of oj 287 was studied based on our data . in 2005 - 06 , we used @xmath6 and @xmath8 bands to calculate the relationship of color and magnitude",
    ". then @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands were used from the end of 2006 .",
    "the results are shown in figures 5 and 6 , respectively .",
    "the linear least square method was used to calculate the correlation coefficient .",
    "the slope we got in figure 5 is 0.137 , with a correlation coefficient of 0.6689 , and the significance level is 0.05 . in figure 6",
    "the slope is 0.1164 , with a correlation coefficient of 0.626 and the significance level is 0.05 .",
    "figures 5 and 6 show strong chromatism of bluer - when - brighter .    the chromatism in figures 5 and 6",
    "are much stronger than figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the reason may be that the wavelength differences of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands ( 4980  ) and the @xmath6 and @xmath8 bands ( 3100  ) are much larger than that of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands ( 1070  ) .",
    "the same phenomenon of bluer - when - brighter was found for oj 287 by some authors .",
    "a strong correlation is observed by brown et al .",
    "( 1989 ) between the near - infrared flux levels and the near - infrared spectral slopes of oj287 , in the sense that the spectra are steeper when the sources are fainter .",
    "carini et al .",
    "( 1992 ) found that there does not appear to be a well - defined correlation between brightness and color of oj287 ; however , there is a general indication that when the source is brighter , it tends to be bluer . according to the comparison of the outburst of 1994 with those of 1971 and 1983 , hagen - thorn et al .",
    "( 1998 ) got that there is a clear correlation between the power of outburst and color indices of the variable component in each event : the larger is the outburst , the bluer is the source .",
    "vagnetti et al .",
    "( 2003 ) pointed out that eight bl lac objects including oj287 tend to be bluer when brighter .",
    "fiorucci et al . ( 2004 ) reported that lots of bl lac objects such as oj 287 display the phenomenon of bluer when brighter .",
    "( 2006 ) also discovered a bluer - when - brighter chromatism in this object .",
    "villforth et al .",
    "( 2010 ) studied the optical spectral index variations and found a bluer - when - brighter trend .",
    "in fact , bluer - when - brighter chromatism tends to be a general feature of bl lac objects @xcite .",
    "wu et al . ( 2007 ) mentioned that difference in amplitude and pace of the variations at different wavelengths may both lead to color change .",
    "here we made some simulations to clarify it .",
    "we created two light curves .",
    "the first one was made by the following steps .",
    "the baseline is a sine curve with an amplitude of 2.0 .",
    "a fluctuation with a random amplitude less than 0.2 was added to the sine curve .",
    "then a random error less than 0.15 was added to each point .",
    "the second light curve was produced by changing the variation amplitudes or phases of the first light curve .",
    "then we studied the color behavior based on the two simulated light curves .",
    "1 .   effect of amplitude difference .",
    "the two light curves are different in variation amplitude , with the second light curve having an amplitude of 2.5 , as shown in the left panel of figure 7 .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram is displayed in the right panel of figure 7 . although the points traced a zig - zag route",
    ", the object evolves basically along the diagonal path on the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "a simple linear fit to the points gave a correlation coefficient of 0.9348 , which indicates a strong bluer - when - brighter trend .",
    "if the amplitude difference increases , the slope of the linear fit increases , too .",
    "1 .   effect of time delay . as shown in the left panel of figure 8 , the two light curves are different in variation phase by 1/8 @xmath11 .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram is shown in the right panel .",
    "the numbers indicate the time sequence .",
    "the object evolves on the color - magnitude diagram along an elliptic orbit in the anticlockwise direction .",
    "the major axis of the ellipse is along the line of bluer - when - brighter .",
    "when we changed the phase difference from 1/8 @xmath11 to 1/4 @xmath11 , the slope of the major axis of the ellipse increases , and the ellipticity becomes smaller , but the anticlockwise evolution remains .",
    "except two extreme examples of variability timescale of 15 minutes observed in s5 0716 + 714 @xcite , the variability timescales of optical bands are longer than 1 hour on most occasions @xcite .",
    "however , the observed time delay in optical band is usually shorter than 10 minutes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "if @xmath11 ( the timescale ) , corresponds to one hour , then 1/4 @xmath11 equals 15 min , so that it is no need to consider longer time delay in our simulation .",
    "this loop path on the color - magnitude diagram has been predicted theoretically by kirk et al .",
    "some observational results at high energy were reported by several authors , as mentioned by wu et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "1 .   effect of amplitude and time delay .",
    "the two light curves are different in both amplitude and phase .",
    "the amplitudes of the two light curves are 2.0 and 2.5 , respectively , and the time delay is 1/8 @xmath11 .",
    "such light curves are shown in the left panel of figure 9 .",
    "the right panel gives the relationship of color and magnitude .",
    "the diagram also shows as an ellipse in the anticlockwise direction .",
    "the major axis of ellipse is also along the line of bluer - when - brighter , and the ellipticity is larger than the one in figure 8 .",
    "the simulations confirmed that both amplitude differences and time delay can result in the phenomenon of bluer - when - brighter . in all three cases",
    ", the object tends to be bluer - when - brighter .",
    "the color changes more significantly as the difference in amplitude or phase increases .",
    "moreover , the simulations provided a potential way to distinguish between the factors that lead to the bluer - when - brighter chromatism .",
    "if the object evolves along a diagonal path on the color - magnitude diagram , the amplitude difference dominates the color change .",
    "if there is a loop path on the color - magnitude diagram , at least time delay is involved .",
    "of course , the measurement accuracy is a key factor in the identification of a diagonal or a loop path on the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "based on the data from the oj-94 monitoring project , we found that oj 287 showed a bluer - when - brighter chromatism in its outburst period .",
    "meanwhile , using the data obtained from the 60/90 cm schmidt telescope of naoc in 2005 - 09 , we found an even stronger chromatism .",
    "the amplitude of variation tends to decrease with the decrease of frequency .",
    "our monitoring results proved that after the outburst in 1994 and 1996 , the object underwent a new outburst in 2005 and 2007 after about 12 years and showed a double - peaked structure .",
    "these results further prove the binary black hole model of oj 287 .",
    "however , even with these new observational data , there are still some inconsistent results of the estimates for the masses of the two black holes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the monitoring of this object till next major outburst may help to resolve these conflicts .",
    "we made some simulations and confirmed that both amplitude differences and time delay can result in the phenomenon of bluer - when - brighter .",
    "moreover , the color measurement may be biased by some technical and artificial effects @xcite .",
    "the relation of the color behavior to their central physics may be more complex than expected before .",

    "<S> this paper aims to study the color behavior of the bl lac object oj 287 during optical outburst . </S>",
    "<S> according to the revisit of the data from the oj-94 monitoring project and the analysis the data obtained with the 60/90 cm schmidt telescope of naoc , we found a bluer - when - brighter chromatism in this object . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of variation tends to decrease with the decrease of frequency . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with the shock - in - jet model . </S>",
    "<S> we made some simulations and confirmed that both amplitude difference and time delay between variations at different wavelengths can result in the phenomenon of bluer - when - brighter . </S>",
    "<S> our observations confirmed that oj 287 underwent a double - peaked outburst after about 12 years from 1996 , which provides further evidence for the binary black hole model in this object . </S>"
