    "they further conclude that the large comoving number density , @xmath9 , and the large covering factor @xmath10 suggest that the emitters can be identified with the elusive host population of damped ly@xmath4 systems ( dlas ) and high column density lyman limit systems .",
    "* hereafter ) , building on the successful model for dlas of @xcite , presented a simple model that simultaneously accounts for the kinematic properties and incidence rate of the observed dlas _ and _ the luminosity function and the size distribution of the emitters in the context of the @xmath11cdm model for structure formation .",
    "the model assumes a simple relation between the size of the damped absorption and @xmath0emission regions , and proposes that the @xmath0luminosity is proportional to the total halo mass .",
    "further corroborated the suggestion that cooling radiation is not expected to contribute significantly to the observed @xmath0emission , and that the emitters are most likely powered by star formation .",
    "in the model , dlas are small galaxies hosted by dm halos with masses in the range @xmath12 to @xmath13 @xmath14and have rather large low surface brightness @xmath0 halos which extend to radii of up to 50kpc or larger .    in order to fit",
    "the observed size distribution of the faint @xmath0emitters , assumed that the @xmath0emission extends to radii somewhat larger than is required to reproduce the incidence rate for dlas .",
    "however , no modelling of the gas distribution and @xmath0radiative transfer was done .",
    "we present such modelling here to investigate whether the sizes , surface brightness profiles and spectral line shapes can be reproduced with simple but plausible assumptions for the distribution and the physical properties of the gas in the dm halos suggested by our previous modelling to be the hosts of the faint emitters .",
    "studies of the radiative transfer of @xmath0have a long history .",
    "the first investigations employed approximate calculations and simple physical arguments @xcite .",
    "later , analytic solutions were found for simple geometries in the limit of large optical depth @xcite .",
    "it was realised early , however , that monte carlo simulations provided the most flexible method for investigating arbitrary geometry , density distributions and velocity structures .",
    "many investigations have employed such techniques - , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) , .",
    "our modelling is most similar to that of and , who modelled @xmath0radiative transfer in collapsing proto - galaxies and high - redshift galaxies respectively . in many instances we make similar assumptions as these authors , but",
    "our code was developed independently .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a brief summary of the salient features of our monte - carlo code for @xmath0radiative transfer and show results for standard test problems . in section 3",
    "we discuss our assumptions for the distribution and the physical properties of the gas .",
    "we also show the dependence of the surface brightness profile and the spectral line shapes on these assumptions . in section 4",
    "we present the results for a consistent model of the size distribution and the luminosity function of the faint @xmath0emitters .",
    "the technical details of the implementation of @xmath0radiative transfer monte - carlo algorithm are described in an appendix .",
    "@xmath0is a resonant transition in hydrogen .",
    "the optical depth at line centre @xmath15 of a typical @xmath16region is thus generally very large .",
    "@xmath0photons , which are expected to be produced copiously in star - forming galaxies , will therefore undergo many scatterings .",
    "escape from the @xmath16region usually requires diffusion in both frequency and space .",
    "the properties of the emergent radiation depend sensitively on not only the spatial distribution of the gas , but also on its kinematics , ionization state , temperature and dust content . with modern computers monte - carlo sampling of the diffusion process has become the method of choice .",
    "we employ such a code for simple spatial and kinematical configurations .",
    "our code makes a number of well - tested assumptions and approximations . throughout",
    ", we will use a dimensionless frequency variable @xmath17 , the frequency displacement from line centre in units of the doppler frequency width ( see appendix a for details ) . as the photons experience a large number of scatterings before they escape , we can inject all our photons at line centre in the fluid frame of the gas ( @xmath18 ) for simplicity .",
    "the photon scattering is partially coherent  in the rest frame of the scattering atom , the final frequency of the photon differs from the initial frequency only by the ( often negligible ) effect of atomic recoil .",
    "the direction of the photon post - scattering is chosen from a dipole distribution , although choosing an isotropic distribution makes little difference .",
    "we also incorporate a cosmic abundance of deuterium ( see ) . finally , we give all results in the rest frame of the centre of mass of the emitter .",
    "monte carlo @xmath0rt codes like the one used here can be significantly accelerated by skipping scatterings in the core of the line - profile [ @xcite , ] . in the doppler core ,",
    "the optical depth is so large that the photon experiences very little spatial diffusion while it awaits an encounter with a rapidly moving atom that will scatter it in frequency space into the wings of the line profile .",
    "the gas distributions we consider here are spherically symmetric .",
    "we exploit this symmetry by using an arrangement of spherical shells .",

    "@xcite and @xcite derived an analytic expression for the spectrum @xmath24 of radiation emerging from an optically thick ( @xmath25 ) , uniform , static slab of neutral hydrogen , where line - centre photons are injected at the centre of the slab , atomic recoil is neglected and @xmath15 is the line - centre , centre - to - edge optical depth .",

    "note that @xmath39 .",
    "the agreement is again excellent .",
    "our knowledge of the spatial distribution and kinematics of the neutral hydrogen in the dlas / faint @xmath0emitters is still somewhat limited .",
    "the statistics of the occurrence dlas and their column density distribution give us integral constraints on the spatial distribution of the gas , while the velocity distribution of low ionization species tracing neutral hydrogen gives us some indication of the velocity range of bulk motions .",
    "the bulk motions of the gas appear to have velocities that range from a few tens of km / s to several hundred km / s @xcite .",
    "the relative contribution of ordered and random motions and the role of gas inflow and galactic winds is , however , still very uncertain @xcite .",
    "if the identification of the faint @xmath0emitters as dla host galaxies is indeed correct , then this gives us for the first time constraints on the spatial extent of the gas distribution in individual objects for a sizable ( @xmath0 ) emission selected sample .",
    "while there is still significant ambiguity due to the unknown `` duty cycle '' for @xmath0emission ( as discussed by ) , theoretical modelling gives us a handle on the halo masses and virial velocities expected to host the dlas / faint @xmath0emitters . by duty cycle , we mean the fraction of dm host haloes detectable through their @xmath0emission at any given time .",
    "there are a number of reasons why this fraction may be smaller than unity .",
    "the haloes , for example , may not continuously form stars , but geometrical factors due to a preferential escape of the @xmath0emission in certain directions due to variations in the neutral hydrogen column density ( and/or the dust column density ) should also contribute @xcite .    given these uncertainties ,",
    "we have decided to follow and investigate @xmath0radiative transfer for sources at the centre of dm halos with a range of masses , a duty cycle for @xmath0emission , a simple spherically symmetric gas distributions without dust , and either inflow or outflow with velocities which vary as a power law with radius .",
    "this already leads to a rich variety in the predicted surface brightness profiles and spectral shapes and allows us to study the influence of important physical parameters .",
    "we begin by specifying the radial distribution of neutral hydrogen in a given halo .",
    "the total amount of hydrogen is set relative to the cosmic . ]",
    "mass fraction of hydrogen @xmath40 . throughout",
    "we assume a helium fraction of @xmath41 .",
    "there are a number of reasons to suspect that the hydrogen mass fraction in a typical halo is lower than @xmath42 .",
    "firstly , baryons are subject to the smoothing effects of gas pressure . secondly , gas that forms stars is both ionised and extremely compact .",
    "stars will also ionise the neutral gas around them  this is a source of @xmath0but also reduces the amount of @xmath16that remains to scatter photons .",
    "finally , stellar and agn driven galactic winds are expected to drive gas out of galaxies back into the igm . as a first attempt at modelling this effect ,",
    "we reduce the total mass of baryons in the halo to a fraction @xmath43 of the cosmic value .",
    "on top of reducing the amount of neutral hydrogen in a typical halo , it is known that the uv background will significantly ionise the gas in halos too small to self - shield .",
    "it is also easier for galactic winds to drive gas out of small , shallow halos . in",
    ", this effect was implemented via an exponential suppression of the cross - section of neutral hydrogen below a critical circular velocity @xmath44 .",
    "this was necessary in order to fit the observed velocity width distribution of associated low ionization metal absorption . here",
    ", we will implement this suppression by reducing the total amount of neutral hydrogen in halos below @xmath44 , such that the total mass of neutral hydrogen in a halo of mass @xmath45 is @xmath46 ( see for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "we use the fiducial parameters @xmath47 , @xmath48 .    for the radial distribution of the gas",
    ", we assume an nfw profile at @xmath49 , characterised by a scale radius @xmath50 defined in @xcite .",
    "following the simulations of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation ( 9 ) ) , we alter the nfw profile to give the halo a thermal core at @xmath51 .",
    "the profile is then specified by the total mass of the halo @xmath45 and the concentration parameter @xmath52 . for dependence of the concentration parameter on the mass ,",
    "we take the mean value of the @xmath53 correlation as given by @xcite , @xmath54 for dark matter , @xcite found that @xmath55 , with a log - normal distribution and a scatter around this mean value of @xmath56 , in agreement of the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as we will find later , a significantly larger @xmath57 is appropriate for the baryons ; we will use the column density distribution of dlas to constrain @xmath57 in section [ fnx ] . as we discuss further in section",
    "[ limits ] , the gas in the dlas / faint emitters can be expected to self - shield against the meta - galactic ionizing uv background at @xmath58 .",
    "the corresponding self - shielding radius in the dm halos we are studying here is generally smaller than the virial radius .",
    "we therefore set the outer radius of the @xmath16to be the virial radius in our modelling and also ignore radiative transfer through the igm .",
    "we set @xmath59 k as a fiducial temperature .",
    "the biggest uncertainty in our modelling is probably the kinematical state of the gas .",
    "we follow and for our fiducial model we assume the gas to be infalling with a power - law radial velocity profile given in equation 10 of .",
    "] parameterised by @xmath60 and @xmath4 @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the virial radius , for which we follow the definition of @xcite .",

    "the upper limit describes a spherical top - hat collapse , while the lower limit represents the accretion of massless shells onto a point mass ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "a spherical top - hat would have @xmath65 .    while gas infall will certainly be an important feature of the gas kinematics , star formation driven outflows are also likely to play a role .",
    "note that for a spherically symmetric gas distribution , the red and blue side of the line profiles will just be interchanged if the gas is assumed to be outflowing instead of inflowing with the same velocity profile ( ignoring the very slight effects of recoil and deuterium ) .",

    "we see that , as the mass increases , the emerging photons emerge bluer .",
    "this is because , as we add more gas , the central column densities increase and the photons must shift further from line centre in order to escape .",
    "the @xmath81 profiles are increasingly double - peaked for lower masses , while the @xmath82 profiles only ever have one , blue peak .",
    "this is because the innermost region of the @xmath81 halo has the smallest bulk velocity , and thus most resembles the uniform , static sphere of figure [ fig : plottest ] . as the bulk velocities increase at the centre of the halo , the amount of energy transferred between the gas and photons in each scattering",
    "is increased , favouring one of the two peaks ( the blue / red peak for inflowing / outflowing gas respectively ) .",
    "the surface brightness profile shows that the dominant effect in increasing the mass is that the virial radius ( which we have assumed to be the outer radius of the @xmath16 ) increases .",
    "the @xmath82 profile is much more centrally peaked than the @xmath81 profile .",
    "the reason is that the larger bulk velocities at the centre of the @xmath82 halo can shift the photon into the wings of the spectral line , resulting in reduced spatial diffusion .    for the concentration parameter",
    ", we have considered the values @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the spectra and surface brightness profiles for these models are shown in figure [ fig : fbcv ] .",
    "as the concentration increases , the photons generally emerge bluer .",
    "the @xmath81 profile becomes _ more _ double - peaked as the concentration increases , because the @xmath16column density increases at smaller radii , where the bulk velocity is lower .",
    "the surface brightness profile is also more centrally peaked for higher concentrations , as more scatterings occur at smaller radii .",
    "the effect of changing the baryonic fraction @xmath43 is shown in figure [ fig : fbfe ] .",
    "as baryons are removed from the halo , the spectrum shifts toward @xmath85 and the surface brightness profile becomes more centrally peaked , as there is less gas in the outer parts of the halo to scatter the photons .",
    "the baryon fraction where the photons are not scattered efficiently anymore to the virial radius ( where we have the gas distribution assumed to cut - off ) corresponds to a hi column density of about @xmath86 . for very small @xmath43 and @xmath87",
    ", some of the photons can escape the halo without scattering at all , creating a very narrow peak at @xmath85 .",
    "some of the spectra also show a trough at @xmath88 due to deuterium .",
    "note , however , that for @xmath89 the gas in the halos would not be able to self - shield anymore against the meta - galactic uv background at @xmath58 so the model would be internally inconsistent for such small baryonic fractions .          for the much brighter @xmath0emission seen in many lbgs ,",
    "the @xmath0emission is systematically red - shifted by several hundred @xmath90 .",
    "this is generally attributed to backscattering of the @xmath0radiation from a wind - driven expanding shell .",
    "used a @xmath0rt code similar to ours to calculate the emergent spectrum from an expanding shell .",
    "we will investigate here in a similar fashion if this picture could apply to the emitters .",
    "we consider a shell of @xmath16 , where the inner radius is a fraction @xmath91 times the outer radius @xmath92 .",
    "the shell is expanding at a uniform velocity @xmath93 , and has a column density of @xmath94 .",
    "the temperature is set by the doppler velocity @xmath95 .",
    "our fiducial model has the parameters : @xmath96 , similarly to the fiducial model of verhamme et al . for the outer radius of the shell @xmath92",
    "we have a chosen a value similar to the models of the previous sections .",
    "figure [ fig : fbsh ] shows the effect of altering the parameters that verhamme et al . found to be most important , the column density and the expansion velocity .",
    "note that , for small column densities ( upper panels ) , a certain fraction of photons were able to escape directly without scattering .",
    "these photons form a very sharp peak at @xmath85 , and at small impact parameter , which has been removed from these plots for clarity .    as the column density increases ( top panels ) , the spectrum becomes redder , and the small blue peak disappears , as the photons must scatter further from line centre in order to escape .",
    "the most significant change in the surface brightness profile occurs for small column densities , where some of the photons are able to escape directly , leaving fewer to scatter at large radii .    as the expansion velocity increases ( bottom panels ) ,",
    "the back - scattering mechanism becomes more pronounced .",
    "photons which scatter off the far side of the shell back through its interior are far enough from line centre to escape through the front side of the shell .",
    "this mechanism creates the two red peaks ( the reddest peak comes from photons that backscatter more than once ) . at small velocities ,",
    "we approach a profile similar to the static sphere .",
    "the surface brightness profiles are very flat when compared to the infall / outflow models of the gas in an nfw halo which we had considered before .",
    "qualitatively , they appear much flatter than the profiles of the emitters .",
    "almost all of the emitters show a central peak .",
    "one way to produce a central peak for a shell geometry is for the column density to be low enough for photons to be able to escape directly ; the resolution of the instrument then broadens the delta function at @xmath97 into a central peak .",
    "this would limit the column density of the shell to @xmath98 .",
    "we conclude that the emitters appear unlikely to be halo - scale expanding shells of @xmath16around a central @xmath0source .",
    "the radial ( column ) density distribution and the velocity field are the physical properties which most strongly affect the spectral distribution of the @xmath0emission in our modelling . for a spherical density distribution with neither outflow nor infall",
    ", the distance between the peaks increases with increasing optical depth in the same way as the uniform static slab solution .",
    "infall and outflow lead to a suppression of the red / blue peak and an increased shift of the opposite peak .",
    "the suppression increases with increasing velocity amplitude and optical depth .",
    "the surface brightness profile depends strongly on the radial velocity profile . with increasing amplitude of the bulk motion ,",
    "the diffusion in frequency space is accelerated and the emission becomes more centrally peaked . in our model with increasing amplitude towards decreasing radius ( @xmath82 ) ,",
    "the average bulk motions are larger and the effect is more pronounced . in the model with the expanding shell , the photons can travel unimpeded until they encounter the shell which leads to a rather flat surface brightness profile .",
    "the photons diffuse radially until the column density of neutral hydrogen density drops to values around @xmath86 somewhat dependent on the spatial profile of neutral hydrogen and the velocity field .",
    "the faint extended @xmath0emission should thus have a rather sharp edge which is defined by the surface inside which the gas is able to self - shield and the optical depth rises rapidly .",
    "we begin with a qualitative summary of the properties of the emitters .",
    "note , however , that due to the faintness of the sources the spectral and spatial profiles are rather noisy , making it difficult to identify signatures of inflow ( more prominent blue peak ) or outflow ( more prominent red peak ) .",
    "as discussed in , for 12 of the 27 spectra only a single emission peak is visible while six / three of the spectra show a weak secondary blue / red counter - peak .",
    "the remaining spectra are extended in frequency space without a clear peak structure .",
    "the widths of the spectral peaks ranges from @xmath99 , which corresponds to @xmath100 for gas with a temperature of @xmath101 k. the surface brightness profiles are predominantly centrally peaked with wings that often extend well beyond the gaussian core of the psf .",
    "this is particularly true of the brightest sources , while the fainter sources are more difficult to characterise due to the noise .",
    "modelling the radial distribution of neutral hydrogen in dm halos allows us to calculate the column density distribution along sightlines that intersect the halos .",
    "comparison with the observed column distribution of dlas provides a useful constraint in this regard .",
    "we will use here the same notation as .",
    "the column density distribution is defined such that the number of systems ( @xmath102 ) intersected by a random line of sight between absorption distance ] . ]",
    "@xmath103 and @xmath104 , with @xmath16column density between @xmath105 and @xmath106 is , @xmath107 for our model we calculate this quantity using the ps .",
    "we need two ingredients .",
    "the first is @xmath108 , the mass function of dark matter halos , as calculated by @xcite .",
    "the second ingredient is the column density of neutral hydrogen in a given halo ( of mass @xmath109 at absorption distance @xmath103 ) , as a function of the ( physical ) impact parameter @xmath74 , @xmath110 .",
    "this is calculated from the neutral hydrogen density as a function of radius .",
    "given that @xmath105 is a monotonically decreasing ( and thus invertible ) function of @xmath74 , the region between @xmath105 and @xmath106 is an annulus with cross - sectional area @xmath111 .",
    "hence , we can write the column density distribution as , @xmath112    the results are shown in figure [ fig : fnx ] .",
    "the most important parameters ( given that we integrate over all m ) are the normalisation of the concentration parameter for the baryons @xmath57 , and the baryon fraction @xmath43 relative to the cosmic value .",
    "a good fit to the observed column density distribution is obtained for @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the figure demonstrates the effect of altering these two parameters . decreasing @xmath43 decreases the overall normalisation , while @xmath57 mostly affects the high column density end of the distribution . changing @xmath44 has a comparatively small effect .",
    "note that our model somewhat overpredicts the number of absorption systems with column densities below @xmath115 , in the regime of lyman limit systems ( lls ) . in this column density",
    "range the observed @xmath116 flattens significantly @xcite , an effect which can be attributed to the inability of ( super ) lls to self - shield completely against the meta - galactic uv background @xcite . since we have not attempted to model the ionization of the gas and in particular the self - shielding of the gas in any detail , it is not surprising that our model does not reproduce this .",
    "the uv background should , however , not effect our results for the population of predominantly neutral dlas .",

    "the success of @xcite in reproducing the observed metalicity distribution is additional evidence in favour of this mass range , as are the observed spatial correlation of dlas and lbgs @xcite .      in , we presented modelling in which we assumed simple scaling relations for the sizes and luminosities of the rauch et al .",
    "emitters with the masses / circular velocities of their dm host haloes .",
    "the scaling relation for the sizes was motivated by the modelling of the velocity width distribution of the associated low ionization metal absorption of dlas by @xcite .",
    "no attempt to model the spatial and spectral distribution of the @xmath0emission was made in .",
    "it is thus gratifying that our modeling here with @xmath0radiative transfer through inflowing / outflowing distributions of neutral hydrogen in the emitters for which the radial profile is constrained by the observed column density ditribution is able to still fit the luminosity function and size distribution of the emitters as well as the velocity width distribution of dlas for a specific choice of the scaling of the inflow / outflow velocity with radius .",
    "this is a non - trivial result and means that the radiative transfer calculations as constrained by the observed properties of the rauch et al .",
    "emitters and dlas produce a scaling relation of the sizes of emitters with the masses / circular velocities of their dm host haloes very simular to that assumed by .",
    "our modelling has a number of limitations and ( over- ) simplifications that we will discuss in this section .",
    "firstly , we have assumed spherical symmetry throughout .",
    "deviations from a uniform spherical configuration will most likely make escape easier for @xmath0photons in certain directions .",
    "similarly , our simple velocity field is certainly an oversimplification .",
    "more complex velocity fields may bring photons passing through gas in the outer regions of the halo back toward line centre .",
    "this may also increase the spatial extent of the emitter .",
    "we have also ignored radiative transfer outside the virial radius of the halo .",
    "this effectively assumes not only that scattering in the outer parts of dm halos is negligible but that the same is true for scattering by the neutral hydrogen contained in the igm .",
    "whether these are reasonable assumptions will depend both on the poorly constrained distribution of neutral hydrogen in the outer parts of low - mass dm halos and on the bulk motion of the scattering gas relative to the igm ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we have furthermore not modelled the effect of ionising radiation , either from external or internal sources of ionising photons , except by reducing the amount of neutral hydrogen within the virial radius of the dm halos below its cosmic value , ostensibly due to the effects of the uv background .",
    "more sophisticated modelling should take into account the self - shielding of the gas against the meta - galactic uv background self - consistently .",
    "we have checked here that the radius at which the gas is able to maintain neutrality by self - shielding is @xmath161 , the size of the emission region at the flux level of the rauch et al .",
    "emitters as defined in section [ sizelum ] .",
    "the meta - galactic uv background should thus have little effect on the size of the @xmath0emission region predicted by our modelling .",
    "note , however , that this will not be the case anymore at fainter flux levels as the neutral hydrogen density / column density will drop sharply outside the region able to self - shield .    internal sources of ionising stars such as stars would reduce the neutral fraction of the gas , and in an inhomogeneous manner .",
    "neither stars nor the uv background are expected to significantly ionise the bulk of the neutral gas in the proto - galaxies studied here  these are the sites of dlas after all . spatially extended star formation is likely to increase the production of @xmath0 at large radii , possibly increasing the observed size of the emitters .",
    "finally , we have also ignored the effects of dust .",
    "our assumption of a negligible effect of dust may not be unreasonable as dlas are known to have a rather small dust content and the escape fraction for @xmath0emission appears to increase strongly towards unity with decreasing stellar mass of the emitters @xcite .",
    "the recent modelling of @xmath0radiative transfer by @xcite including dust also suggest that for the majority of dlas , with their rather low metallicity which are hosted by rather low mass halos , the effect of dust is probably not too important .",
    "note however that there are counter - examples .",
    "as shown by , models with almost complete absorption of dust can explain the fact that the expected @xmath0emission from the star formation in izw 18 appears to be entirely absorbed despite a rather modest reddening .",
    "as discussed in section 3.1.1 , the presence of dust may actually be ( partially ) responsible for the smaller than unity duty cycle which we require to fit the luminosity function .",
    "note also that the effect of dust should depend sensitively on the clumpiness of the neutral gas @xcite .",
    "we have used a monte - carlo radiative transfer code to model the spatial and frequency distribution of the @xmath0emission due to star formation in ( proto-)galaxies at the centre of dm halos with masses of @xmath12 to @xmath162 for a range of assumptions for the spatial distribution and the dynamical state of neutral hydrogen .",
    "dm halos in this mass range had been previously identified as the likely hosts of dlas and the recently detected population of faint spatially extended @xmath0emitters .",
    "our main results are the following :    * as previously found by other authors , the spectral shape of the @xmath0emission from star formation in galaxies for which the dynamics of neutral hydrogen is dominated by infall / outflow is characterized by a strong blue / red peak , occasionally accompanied by a weaker red / blue peak .",
    "the spectral shape is very sensitive to the spatial distribution , velocity structure and ( to a smaller extent ) the temperature structure of the gas .",
    "the larger central column densities in the more massive galaxies / halos make escape of the @xmath0photons more difficult .",
    "the photons must then scatter further in frequency and space and thus emerge with a larger frequency shift and the emission extends to larger radii .",
    "larger bulk motions lead to more energy per scattering being transferred between the photons and the gas .",
    "this results in a larger frequency shift of the dominant spectral peak and a larger contrast between the strong and weak spectral peak . *",
    "the surface brightness profiles for photons emitted at the centre of the halos show a central peak with wings extending as far as our assumed neutral hydrogen distribution as long as the column density of neutral hydrogen exceeds about @xmath163 .",
    "the spatial profile of the emission is likewise sensitive to the spatial distribution , velocity and temperature structure of the gas .",
    "the spatial distribution is significantly more centrally peaked when the amplitude of the bulk motions increase toward the centre of the halo .",
    "* expanding shells of neutral hydrogen similar to those invoked to explain the @xmath0emission from lbgs produce spectra with one or more prominent red peaks .",
    "the surface brightness profiles are very flat , remaining essentially constant for 75% of the radius of the shell .",
    "this appears at odds with the observed profiles of the emitters , almost all of which show a central peak . *",
    "our modelling simultaneously reproduces the column density distribution of the neutral hydrogen and the velocity width of the associated low ionisation metal absorption of dlas , as well as the size distribution and the luminosity function of the rauch et al .",
    "emitters if we assume i ) that absorbers and emitters are hosted by dm halos that retain about 20% of the cosmic baryon fraction in the form of neutral hydrogen , with a spatial distribution which follows a nfw profile with concentration parameter @xmath164 times larger than that of the dark matter , ii ) that absorbers and emitters are hosted by dm halos with virial velocities @xmath165 , and iii ) that the central @xmath0emission due to star formation has a duty cycle of @xmath166 and the luminosity is proportional to the mass of neutral hydrogen in the dm halos .",
    "* the dm halos that contribute most to the incidence rate of dlas have masses in the range @xmath167 - @xmath168 and virial velocities in the range of 35 to 230 @xmath90 . the lower cut - off is mainly determined by the rather sharp decrease in the velocity width distribution of the associated low - ionization metal absorption in dlas at velocity width @xmath169 but may also be reflected in the turn - over of the @xmath0luminosity function at the faintest fluxes .",
    "the dm host halo masses are significantly smaller than those inferred for @xmath170 lbgs , consistent with the much higher space density of the faint emitters .",
    "the success of our detailed @xmath0radiative transfer modelling in explaining the observed properties of both dlas and the faint rauch et al emitters with a consistent set of assumptions further strengthens the suggestion that the faint emitters are indeed the long - searched for host galaxies of dla / lls .",
    "together with our modelling , the observed properties of the faint emitters should thus provide robust estimates not only of the space density , @xmath0luminosity and extent of the gas distribution but also of the masses of the dm halos , the duty cycle of star formation and the spatial profile and kinematics of the gas distribution of a statistically representative sample of dla host galaxies",
    ". the current ultra - deep spectroscopic surveys in the hudf and hdf should soon provide important additional information on the stellar content and possibly also dust content of these objects which will allow to further test the nature of what are almost certainly the building blocks of typical present - day galaxies like our own .",

    "it is worth noting how the integrand depends on position .",
    "the most obvious dependence is that of a spatially varying density @xmath174 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath209 is two - fold .",
    "firstly , in case of a spatially - varying bulk velocity , @xmath210 . secondly , if @xmath211 depends on position , then so will both @xmath17 and @xmath212 in @xmath213 via @xmath190 and @xmath214 .",
    "+ once @xmath202 is found , the position of the next scattering is @xmath215 .",
    "if this is outside the hi region , then the algorithm is terminated .",
    "next we choose the velocity of the scattering atom .",
    "naively , one might think that this step involves generating the three components of the atom s velocity from the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "however , we are choosing the velocity of an atom _ given _ that it scatters a photon with frequency @xmath17 .",
    "we can therefore divide the velocity of the atom into one component parallel ( @xmath216 ) and two components perpendicular to the direction of motion of the photon ( @xmath217 , @xmath218 ) .",
    "the two perpendicular components do not alter the frequency of the photon as seen by the atom , and are thus chosen from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution . from equations",
    "- it can be seen that the probability that a photon with frequency @xmath17 scatters off an atom with velocity ( along the direction of propagation of the photon ) between @xmath216 and @xmath219 is , @xmath220 where @xmath221 .",
    "a scheme for generating random numbers from this distribution is given in @xcite .",
    "now that we have calculated @xmath222 , the velocity of the atom that scatters the photon , we perform a lorentz transform into the rest frame of the atom . in this frame , we assume that the frequency of the scattered photon differs from the frequency of the incident photon only by the recoil effect ( * ? ? ?",

    "+ we now return to step [ choosedist ] and repeat it until the photon escapes the hi region .",
    "once the photon escapes the region , its properties ( frequency , angle of escape etc . )",
    "are recorded .",
    "we then return to step [ generate ] and generate another photon .",
    "our code incorporates the presence of a cosmic abundance of deuterium , following the method presented in . adding deuterium has only a minimal effect .",
    "monte carlo @xmath0rt codes like the one used here can be significantly accelerated by skipping scatterings in the core of the line profile .",
    "we define the core - to - wing transition to occur at a critical frequency @xmath226 , which is not the same as @xmath193 .",
    "whenever a photon is in the core @xmath227 , we force it into the wing by choosing the scattering atom s velocity to be large .",
    "we follow the method presented in @xcite , , choosing the perpendicular components of the atom s velocity such that @xmath228 .",
    "we choose the value of @xmath226by requiring that , for a uniform sphere , less than a fraction @xmath229 of the photons that emerge have @xmath230 . using the analytic solution for the emergent spectrum of a sphere ,",

    "we find that setting @xmath232 up to max@xmath233 gives an acceptable compromise between speed and accuracy .",
    "this procedure can accelerate the code by several orders of magnitude , e.g. for a static sphere with @xmath234 , the code is accelerated by a factor of more than a thousand .      in cases where @xmath235 , @xmath211 and/or @xmath236 have a complicated dependence on @xmath237 , solving for @xmath202 in equation can be computationally expensive .",
    "in spherical symmetry , we use a similar approach to , dividing the sphere into shells of uniform density . within each shell ,",
    "the integral becomes trivial , @xmath238 .",
    "if the edge of a shell is reached , the optical depth to the edge of the shell is subtracted from @xmath198 and a new @xmath202 is calculated using the new value of @xmath239 .",
    "we space the shells so that each shell has equal column density .",
    "we choose the number of shells to keep the frequency dispersion within each shell small compared to the change in frequency as the photon crosses a shell ; 1000 shells are usually sufficient .",
    "in this section , we will consider the effect of altering the gas temperature and amplitude of the bulk velocity .",
    "for this section , the fiducial model is different to that in section [ fidmod ] : @xmath240 .      in this section ,",
    "we consider the effect of decreasing @xmath60 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : fbvaf ] .",
    "setting @xmath241 would result in @xmath242 being symmetric about @xmath243 ( ignoring the small effects of deuterium and recoil ) .",
    "this tendency is seen clearly in both of the left plots .",
    "these plots also show that photons emerge bluer as the velocity of infall increases .",
    "photons gain energy from head - on collisions with atoms , and the more energetic the atoms , the more energy is transferred between photons and gas .",
    "the surface brightness plots show that the emission becomes more extended as the velocity is reduced .",
    "a rather flat surface brightness profile is characteristic of a uniform , static @xmath16sphere .",
    "this is because the bulk velocity can give photons a `` free ride '' through the halo , doppler shifting their frequency away from line centre in the fluid frame without changing @xmath17 in the laboratory frame . in the @xmath87 case ,",
    "the peak surface brightness is reduced by almost 2 orders of magnitude by this effect .",
    "it is also worth noting that the smaller @xmath60 is , the less the dependence of the profile on @xmath4 .",
    "the effect of altering the temperature is shown in figure [ fig : fbt ] .",
    "note that the spectrum is given as a function of velocity ( @xmath244 ) , as @xmath17 itself is temperature dependent ( @xmath245 ) . for the @xmath82 case",
    ", there is no dependence on the temperature because the photon begins its flight with a frequency ( in the fluid frame ) in the scattering wings , and is unlikely to return to the doppler core .",
    "remember that the scattering cross - section does not depend on @xmath211 in the lorentz wing of the profile . in the @xmath81 case ,",
    "the effect of temperature is minimal .",
    "the red peak disappears at lower temperatures due to the corresponding increase in the scattering cross - section , @xmath246 , when @xmath17 is small ."
