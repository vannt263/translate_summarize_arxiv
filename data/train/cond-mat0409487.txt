    "in x - ray crystallography , the phases of the diffracted waves are roughly estimated by mathematical methods , know as _ direct methods _  @xcite , for analyzing intensity data sets composed of a large number of reflections .",
    "these methods exploit algebraic or probabilistic relationships among the phase values .",
    "some of such relationships are triplet phase invariants ; they are invariant from the choice of origin in the crystal lattice .",
    "experimental procedures allowing physical measurements of phase invariants are of great interest since , in principle , they could extend the efficiency of the _ direct methods _ to complex structures such as proteins .",
    "it would have to be compared to other procedures that are actually used to the same purposes , such as multiple anomalous dispersion and multiple isomorphous replacement  @xcite .",
    "experimental ( open circles ) and simulated ( solid lines ) @xmath0-scans of the @xmath1 three - beam diffraction in a kdp crystal taken at different polarization angle , @xmath2 ( right - hand side of each scan ) . [",
    "001 ] is the reference direction ( @xmath3 , see inset ) , x - ray photon energy is 7482ev , and further experimental details can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the intensity scale is linear , but for visualization purposes the ordinates of some scans are shifted from their actual values , given at the left ( in cps ) .",
    "the @xmath0-scan at @xmath4 ( gray scan ) was mistakenly collected at the shoulder of the 260 reflection ( @xmath5 , 30% of the fwhm  @xmath6 ) .",
    "the flexibility of the fitting equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , to reproduce these @xmath0-scans is exploited in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b).,width=201 ]    physical measurements of triplet phase invariants are possible by means of three - beam diffraction ( 3bd ) experiments  @xcite where the interference of simultaneously diffracted waves provide information on phase values . however , besides all experimental and analytical difficulties involved in phase determination from 3bd experiments , the most serious and practical limitation of physical - phasing crystallography ( ppc ) is the reduce number of 3bd cases suitable for phasing .",
    "the reciprocal space of complex molecule crystals are full of reflections where isolated 3bd cases have become even more rare ; phasing general @xmath7-beam cases ( @xmath8 ) is not feasible at the moment due to theoretical deficiencies .",
    "therefore , it is important to mention that , regarding complex crystals , the usefulness of ppc is quite limited when compared to the available phasing procedures . nevertheless , there are researches focused on developing and optimizing experimental data collection procedures for ppc  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the 3bd experiments offer an unique opportunity for accurate determination of triplet phase invariants , and consequently , for studying crystalline structures via measurements of these invariants .",
    "for example , depending on the achieved experimental accuracy , electron density of chemical bonding charges  @xcite or even distortion of molecules under applied electric field can be investigated by monitoring a few triplet phases .",
    "note that each triplet phase is an absolute value since it already is the phase differences between two diffracted x - ray waves , and not a relative quantity such as obtained in peak position or intensity measurements .",
    "this work has been motivated by our desired of developing at lnls a systematic and practical procedure for determining phase invariants with good accuracy .",
    "experimental and analytical procedures are still to be improved to push phase measurements from the state - of - art to routinely and automatic phasing procedures ; otherwise it will be very difficult to non - expert users to take advantages of the new possibilities offered by measuring this physical quantity .",
    "data collection procedures are already proposed  @xcite , and undergoing improvement  @xcite , but the actual challenger is the data analysis procedure  @xcite . here",
    ", we outline the underneath principals for developing an automatic procedure to extract accurate phase values from 3bd interference profiles .",
    "a general systematic procedure is demonstrated , in practice , by analyzing 3bd intensity data from a kdp crystal , and the major sources of errors are pointed out .",
    "in general , the 3bd intensity profiles are dominated by the interference of two diffracted waves .",
    "it leads to a relatively simple parametric equation that can be used to fit most of the experimental intensity profiles and to extract the phase values .",
    "it is given by  @xcite    @xmath9\\texttt{g}(\\varphi - u){\\rm d}u \\label{eq1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the amplitudes of the primary and secondary electric displacement wavefields generated by the primary reflection , a , and by the detour reflection ( also known as _",
    "reflection ) formed by two consecutive reflections , b and c. @xmath12 stands for maximum amplitude ratio of these waves . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are polarization factors for linearly polarized incident radiation .",
    "@xmath15 is the phase difference between these waves , which is the triplet phase invariant .",
    "a gaussian convolution , @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , is necessary to account for the instrumental width @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 $ ] is a line profile function ( fwhm @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) describing the intrinsic 3bd profile as a function of the azimuthal rotation angle @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are related to energy balance mechanisms among the diffracted beams and crystalline imperfections , respectively  @xcite .",
    "essentially , the analytical problem in accurate phase determination resides on how to adjust the vector of parameters , @xmath25 $ ] , without compromising the extracted values for @xmath15 . here , a simple and fast evolutionary algorithm ( dea )  @xcite has been used for fitting the experimental profiles where the improvements of the fittings are guided by a mean - absolute deviation function , @xmath26 . the basic strategy is then to find out the minimum of @xmath26 as a function of @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath27 , while * p * is kept within reasonable ranges of allowed values .",
    "the minimum of the @xmath27 curve , @xmath28 , provide the experimental value for @xmath15 .",
    "fig .  [ fig1 ] shows set of 3bd data collected at brazilian synchrotron light laboratory ( lnls ) with the polarimeter - like diffractometer described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "it is composed of several @xmath0-scans taken at different polarization angles @xmath2 , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "instrumental broadening effects on the interference profiles , as illustratively shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , can reduce accuracy when combined with the uncertainty of the @xmath12 parameter , which is in fact the major source of inaccuracy , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "the @xmath27 curves in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) is just showing that it is not possible to extract an accurate value of @xmath27 from a single @xmath0-scan when @xmath12 is unknown .        the best strategy , that we could elaborate , for accurate determination of triplet phases is composing polarization - dependent sets of azimuthal scans , as the one in fig .  [ fig1 ] , and then , search for the value of @xmath12 that provides @xmath28 as close as possible of a same @xmath15 value .",
    "here this search strategy has been applied in two sets of azimuthal scans : a simulated one that is free of instrumental effects such as statistic noise and sample misalignments , and another that is the experimental data in fig .",
    "the @xmath27 curves of the simulated @xmath0-scans for several values of @xmath12 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) while fig .  [ fig3](b ) shows the respective @xmath27 curves for the experimental data .",
    "the data analyses presented here have demonstrated that systematic and reliable phasing procedures are feasible .",
    "however , accuracy can be improved by optimizing the incident x - ray beam optics regarding energy resolution and angular divergences , mainly in the horizontal plane .",
    "a good instrumental precision is also required as well as low noise in the intensity data .",
