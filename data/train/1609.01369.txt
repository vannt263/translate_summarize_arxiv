    "<S> interlayer electron transport through a graphene / hexagonal boron - nitride ( h - bn ) / graphene heterostructure is strongly affected by the misorientation angle @xmath0 of the h - bn with respect to the graphene layers with different physical mechanisms governing the transport in different regimes of angle , fermi level , and bias . </S>",
    "<S> the different mechanisms and their resulting signatures in resistance and current are analyzed using two different models , a tight - binding , non - equilibrium green function model and an effective continuum model , and the qualitative features resulting from the two different models compare well . in the large - angle regime ( @xmath1 ) , the change in the effective h - bn bandgap seen by an electron at the @xmath2 point of the graphene causes the resistance to monotonically increase with angle by several orders of magnitude reaching a maximum at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it does not affect the peak - to - valley current ratios in devices that exhibit negative differential resistance . in the small - angle regime ( @xmath4 ) , umklapp processes open up new conductance channels that manifest themselves as non - monotonic features in a plot of resistance versus fermi level that can serve as experimental signatures of this effect . for small angles and high bias , </S>",
    "<S> the umklapp processes give rise to two new current peaks on either side of the direct tunneling peak . </S>"
