    "shape oscillations of levitated metal droplets can be used to measure the surface tension and viscosity of liquid metals ( @xcite ) .",
    "theoretically , the former determines the frequency , while the latter accounts for the damping rate of oscillations . in the reality , experimental measurements may be affected by several side - effects .",
    "firstly , levitated drops may be significantly aspherical and the oscillations amplitudes not necessarily small , whereas the classical theories describing the oscillation frequencies ( @xcite ) and damping rates ( @xcite ) assume small - amplitude oscillations about an ideally spherical equilibrium shape .",
    "corrections due to the drop asphericity have been calculated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite find the same order correction to the damping rate resulting also from ac - magnetic field .",
    "the effect of a moderate amplitude on the oscillations of inviscid drops has been analysed by @xcite who find that the oscillation frequency decreases with the square of the amplitude . using a boundary - integral method , @xcite",
    "show that small viscosity has a relatively large effect on the resonant - mode coupling phenomena in the nonlinear oscillations of large axially symmetric drops in zero gravity .",
    "numerical simulation of large - amplitude axisymmetric oscillations of viscous liquid drop by @xcite , who uses the galerkin / finite - element technique , shows that a finite viscosity results in a much stronger mode coupling than predicted by the small - viscosity approximation .",
    "secondly , the measurements may strongly be disturbed by ac - driven flow in the drop .",
    "the mode coupling by the internal circulation in axisymmetrically oscillating drop has been studied numerically by @xcite using the galerkin / finite - element technique . to reduce the strength of the ac field necessary for the levitation and ,",
    "thus , to minimise the flow , experiments may be conducted under the microgravity conditions during parabolic flights or on the board of space station ( @xcite ) .",
    "a cheaper alternative might be to apply a sufficiently strong dc magnetic field that can not only stabilise ac - driven flow but also suppress the convective heat and momentum transport responsible for the mode coupling under the terrestrial conditions as originally shown by @xcite .",
    "such an approach has been implemented first by @xcite on the electromagnetically levitated drops of copper and nickel which were submitted to a dc field of the induction up to @xmath0 the only motion of @xmath1 drops observed to persist in magnetic field above @xmath2 was a solid - body rotation about an axis parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "no shape oscillations , usually induced by the ac - driven flow fluctuations , were observed .",
    "note that this implies only the suppression of ac - driven flow but not of the shape oscillations themselves which require an external excitation to be observable .",
    "@xcite study the effect of suppression of the melt flow on the structure of various alloys obtained by the electromagnetic levitation melting technique in a strong superimposed dc magnetic field .",
    "the use of high magnetic fields in various material processing applications is reviewed by @xcite .",
    "note that a similar suppression of ac - driven flow can also be achieved by a fast spinning of the drop ( @xcite ) that may be driven by an electromagnetic spin - up instability ( @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of both the drop rotation and ac - driven flow on the frequency spectrum of shape oscillations have been modelled numerically by @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrates numerically that a large enough oscillation amplitude can compensate for the effect of rotation on the frequency shift .",
    "a novel method of measuring thermal conductivity of liquid silicon using the electromagnetic levitation in a strong superimposed dc magnetic has been introduced by @xcite .",
    "subsequent numerical modelling by @xcite shows that applying a dc magnetic field of @xmath3 can suppress convection in molten silicon droplet enough to measure its real thermal conductivity . later on this method has been extended to the measurements of heat capacity of molten austenitic stainless steel ( @xcite ) and also that of supercooled liquid silicon ( @xcite ) .    in order to determine the surface tension and viscosity or the electrical conductivity one needs to relate the observed surface oscillations with the relevant thermophysical properties of the liquid .",
    "general small - amplitude shape oscillations of conducting drop in a uniform dc magnetic field have been analysed first by @xcite .",
    "although a magnetic field of arbitrary strength is considered , the solution is restricted to inviscid drops . moreover , only the frequency spectrum and magnetic damping rates are found but not the associated shape eigenmodes , which may be useful for experimental identification of the oscillation modes .",
    "energy dissipation by axisymmetric oscillations of a conducting drop in a weak dc magnetic field is considered by @xcite , who finds the magnetic damping rates in agreement with more general results of @xcite .",
    "axisymmetric oscillations of an electromagnetically levitated drop of molten @xmath4 in a superimposed dc magnetic field are modelled numerically by @xcite .",
    "a moderate dc magnetic field is shown to stabilise ac - driven flow and , thus , to eliminate the associated shape oscillations .",
    "a three - dimensional numerical simulation of an oscillating liquid metal drop in a uniform static magnetic field has been carried out by @xcite .",
    "the numerical results show that vertical magnetic field effectively damps the flow , while horizontal field tries to render the flow two - dimensional .    in the present paper , we analyse free oscillations of a viscous electrically conducting drop in a homogeneous dc magnetic field .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we assume the viscosity to be small but non - zero and the magnetic field to be strong .",
    "this allows us to obtain an asymptotic solution to the eigenvalue problem for general small - amplitude 3d shape oscillations including the eigenmodes left out by @xcite , which are necessary for the subsequent determination of the viscous damping .",
    "firstly , we show that the eigenmodes of shape oscillations are not affected by strong magnetic field .",
    "namely , they remain the spherical harmonics as in the non - magnetic case .",
    "the magnetic field , however , changes the internal flow associated with the surface oscillations and , thus , the frequency spectrum . as the drop oscillates in a strong magnetic field , the liquid moves as solid columns aligned with the field .",
    "two types of such oscillations are possible : longitudinal and transversal to the magnetic field .",
    "the oscillations are weakly damped by a strong magnetic field , except for both the axisymmetric transversal and inherently 2d modes .",
    "the former are magnetically overdamped because the incompressibility constraint does not permit an axially uniform radial flow .",
    "the latter , which are transversal modes defined by the spherical harmonics with equal degree and order , @xmath5 , are not affected at all because these modes are naturally invariant along the field . because the magnetic damping for all other modes decreases inversely with the square of the field strength ,",
    "the viscous damping may become important in a sufficiently strong magnetic field .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the problem is formulated in @xmath6[sec : prob ] .",
    "section [ sec : invisc ] presents an inviscid asymptotic solution which yields the shape eigenmodes and frequency spectrum of longitudinal and transversal oscillations .",
    "magnetic damping is found in @xmath6[sub : mag - damp ] as a next - order asymptotic correction to the frequency .",
    "viscous damping rates are calculated in @xmath6[sub : visc - damp ] first by the eigenvalue perturbation technique for the longitudinal modes and then by an energy dissipation approach for both of the oscillation modes .",
    "the paper is concluded by a summary and discussion of the results in @xmath6[sec : conc ] .",

    "firstly , owing to the incompressibility constraint , only two velocity components are mutually independent .",
    "secondly , velocity is related to the pressure and electric potential by ( [ eq : ns ] ) , which can be used to represent @xmath13 in terms of @xmath14 and @xmath22 as done in the following .",
    "boundary conditions are applied at the drop surface @xmath32 defined by its spherical radius @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a small perturbation , which depends on the poloidal and azimuthal angles , @xmath35 and @xmath36 and the time @xmath37 .",
    "the radial velocity at the surface is related to the radius perturbation by the kinematic constraint @xmath38 the normal component of the current at the drop surface , which is assumed to be surrounded by vacuum or insulating gas , vanishes , i.e. , @xmath39 in addition , there is no tangential stress at the free surface : @xmath40 while the normal stress component is balanced by the capillary pressure @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the constant part of pressure , @xmath43 is a unit tangent vector and @xmath44 is the outward surface normal . for small - amplitude oscillations defined by @xmath45 we have @xmath46    henceforth",
    ", we proceed to dimensionless variables by choosing the radius @xmath47 and the characteristic capillary pressure @xmath48 as the length and pressure scales .",
    "the characteristic period of capillary oscillations is determined by the balance of inertia and pressure , which yields the time scale @xmath49 the velocity and potential scales are chosen as @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively , where @xmath52 in the dimensionless variables , ( [ eq : pfv ] ) takes the form@xmath53\\{p,\\varphi,\\vec{v}\\}=0,\\label{eq : pfv - nd}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is a unit vector in the direction of the magnetic field and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the conventional and magnetic capillary numbers , respectively .",
    "they are the ratios of the capillary oscillation time @xmath17 defined above and the viscous and magnetic damping times , which are @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively . in the dimensionless form ,",

    "note that imaginary @xmath123 describes constant - amplitude harmonic oscillations with the circular frequency @xmath124 which differs from the corresponding non - magnetic result only by the factor of @xmath125 ( @xcite ) , and coincides with the result stated by @xcite .",
    "thus , strong magnetic field changes only the eigenfrequencies but not the eigenmodes of shape oscillations which , as without the magnetic field , are represented by separate spherical functions ( associated legendre functions with integer indices ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "similarly to the non - magnetic case , the frequency spectrum for odd modes is degenerate because it depends only on the degree @xmath93 but not on the order @xmath100 thus , for each @xmath126 there are @xmath127 $ ] odd modes with different @xmath100    taking into account that @xmath128 at the surface , the radial pressure distribution is obtained from ( [ eq : r0-o ] ) as @xmath129 according to ( [ eq : ns-|| ] ) , this pressure distribution is associated with the axial velocity component @xmath130 while two other velocity components transversal to the magnetic field are absent in the leading - order approximation .",

    "firstly , the oscillation frequency for the axisymmetric modes specified by @xmath147 is zero .",
    "this means that these modes are over - damped and do not oscillate at all .",
    "secondly , the oscillation frequency for the modes with @xmath148 is exactly the same as without the magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath149 this is because the liquid flow associated with these oscillation modes is inherently invariant along the field and , thus , not affected by the last ( @xcite ) .",
    "the electric potential and pressure distributions follow from ( [ eq : r0-e ] ) and ( [ eq : p0-e ] ) as @xmath150 the associated velocity distribution is obtained from ( [ eq : ns - nd ] ) .",
    "firstly , equation ( [ eq : ns-|| ] ) implies that the liquid oscillations are purely transversal to the magnetic field . in the leading - order terms",
    ", we obtain from ( [ eq : ns - nd ] ) @xmath151 which shows that the velocity is not only transversal but also invariant along the magnetic field .",
    "thus , the liquid again oscillates as solid columns , but in this case transversely to the field which has no effect on such a flow .",
    "this is because the e.m.f induced by the flow , which is invariant along the magnetic field , is irrotational , i.e. , @xmath152 and , thus , unable to drive current circulation in a closed liquid volume .",
    "note that for the axisymmetric modes @xmath153 the potential ( [ sol : phi0-p ] ) and the associated velocity ( [ sol : v0-e ] ) take an indeterminate form .",
    "namely , for @xmath154 boundary condition ( [ eq : r0-e ] ) , which in this is case straightforwardly implies a zero frequency , is satisfied by an arbitrary potential distribution independent of the radius perturbation . as seen from ( [ sol : phi0-p ] ) , a non - zero axisymmetric potential is associated with a purely azimuthal velocity .",
    "consequently , this mode is irrelevant and can subsequently be neglected because it represents an internal flow perturbation which is just compatible but not coupled with axisymmetric shape deformations similarly to the fast modes discussed at the end of @xmath6[sec : invisc ] .",
    "moreover , this is consistent with ( [ sol : bt0-e ] ) according to which axisymmetric transversal modes are static in the leading - order approximation that implies a zero velocity and , consequently , a zero associated potential .",

    "now , instead of the kinematic and electric boundary conditions ( [ eq : r1-cnd ] ) and ( [ eq : phi - cnd ] ) derived in the inviscid approximation , we have to use the original ones ( [ eq : kinc ] ) and ( [ eq : jr ] ) containing the velocity , which again follows from the navier - stokes equation ( [ eq : ns - nd ] ) including the viscous term @xmath195    for the longitudinal modes , described by the odd solutions , ( [ eq : ns - nd ] ) yields @xmath196 where @xmath197 and @xmath198 are the velocity components parallel and perpendicular , respectively , to the field direction @xmath199 and @xmath200 is a spectral counterpart of the nabla operator for the azimuthal mode @xmath100 since , as shown above , both the potential and velocity perturbations in the hartmann layer are higher - order small quantities and , thus , negligible with respect to the core perturbation , the electric boundary condition ( [ eq : jr ] ) can be applied at @xmath87 directly to the first - order core solution as @xmath201 taking into account ( [ eq : u01-o ] ) , this yields @xmath202 and , hence , @xmath203 consequently , the first - order velocity perturbation in the core for the odd modes is again purely longitudinal .",
    "then , the kinematic constraint ( [ eq : kinc ] ) for the leading- and first - order terms takes , respectively , the form@xmath204 these expressions combined with ( [ eq : w01-o ] ) result in@xmath205 which defines the first - order core pressure perturbation at @xmath206 in addition , we need also the hartmann layer pressure correction which according to the estimates above is of the same order of magnitude as the core one .    to resolve the hartmann layer , we introduce a stretched coordinate @xmath207 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath208 is the characteristic hartmann layer thickness . in the hartmann layer variables , ( [ eq : phip ] )",
    "takes the form@xmath209 for @xmath210 , the inertial term @xmath211 is negligible in ( [ eq : pfv - bnd ] ) with respect to the magnetic one @xmath212 except for @xmath213 first , ignoring this term , which , as shown below , gives a next - order small correction , the solution of ( [ eq : pfv - bnd ] ) vanishing outside the hartmann layer can be written as @xmath214 where the index @xmath215 denotes the surface distribution of the corresponding quantity",
    ". then the free - slip boundary condition ( [ eq : tblnc ] ) results in@xmath216 for the longitudinal modes , defined by the odd solutions , the leading - order inviscid velocity is purely axial @xmath217 substituting this into ( [ eq : vs - theta ] ) and taking into account that the radial pressure distribution at the surface is related to the radius perturbation by ( [ eq : r0-o ] ) , we obtain@xmath218 pressure is related to the velocity by ( [ eq : p ] ) , which in the dimensionless form reads as @xmath219 in the hartmann layer variables , this equation takes the form @xmath220 substituting the general solutions for pressure and velocity given by ( [ eq : pfv - s ] ) into ( [ eq : p - bnd ] ) and using ( [ eq : vs - theta - o ] ) , we find@xmath221 substituting the normal component of viscous stress @xmath222 together with the core and boundary layer pressure contributions defined by ( [ eq : p01-o ] ) and ( [ eq : ps - o ] ) into the normal stress balance condition ( [ eq : nblnc - nd ] ) , we finally obtain@xmath223.\\label{eq : r01-o}\\ ] ] the sought for viscous damping rate is obtained in the usual way by applying the solvability condition to ( [ eq : r01-o ] ) that after some algebra results in@xmath224\\frac{p_{l}^{m}(z)}{z}\\ , dz=-(2l+1)\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(l(l+1)-m^{2})-1-i_{l}^{m}\\right],\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath225 can be calculated from the above recurrence relation starting with @xmath226 and taking into account that @xmath227 for @xmath228 for the modes with @xmath229 , we have @xmath230 which is the half of the corresponding viscous damping rate without the magnetic field ( @xcite ) . although the viscous damping rate increases for smaller @xmath84 as seen from the numerical values of @xmath231 for the first 7 longitudinal oscillation modes calculated by the mathematica ( @xcite ) and shown in table [ tab : bet01-o ] , it remains below its non - magnetic counterpart up to @xmath232 modes .",
    "note that the r.h.s of ( [ eq : r01-o ] ) has a simple pole @xmath233 singularity at @xmath234 which is due to the neglected inertial term in ( [ eq : pfv - bnd ] ) . as discussed above",
    ", this term becomes relevant for @xmath235 where it cuts off the singularity at @xmath236 this cut - off integrated in ( [ sol : bet01-o ] ) over @xmath235 where @xmath237 for the odd modes , results in the damping rate correction @xmath238 which is a higher - order small quantity .",
    ".[tab : bet01-o]the viscous damping rates @xmath231 for the first 6 longitudinal oscillation modes . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the approach above is not directly applicable to the axisymmetric transversal modes which , as discussed at the end of @xmath6[sub : t - freq ] , are stationary in the leading - order inviscid approximation . for these overdamped modes , a flow with the velocity @xmath239 relative to the leading - order radius perturbation appears only in the first - order approximation , which according to ( [ eq : nrg ] ) produces the same order ohmic dissipation . in this case , dissipation takes place on the account of the surface energy reduction , while that of the kinetic energy is negligible because it is by @xmath240 smaller than the former .",
    "the contribution of the viscous dissipation in ( [ eq : nrg ] ) is @xmath241 which for a low viscosity and a high magnetic field is much smaller than the ohmic dissipation @xmath242 and , thus negligible with respect to the latter .",
    "in the present study , we have considered small - amplitude oscillations of a conducting liquid drop in a uniform dc magnetic field .",
    "viscosity was assumed to be small but the magnetic field strong . combining the regular and matched asymptotic expansion techniques we obtained a relatively simple solution to the associated eigenvalue problem .",
    "firstly , we showed that the eigenmodes of shape oscillations are not affected by strong magnetic field .",
    "namely , they remain the spherical harmonics as in the non - magnetic case . strong magnetic field , however , constrains the liquid flow associated with the oscillations and , thus , reduces the oscillations frequency by increasing apparent inertia of the liquid .",
    "in such a field , liquid oscillates in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) way as solid columns aligned with the field .",
    "two types of oscillations are possible : longitudinal and transversal to the field .",
    "such oscillations are weakly damped by strong magnetic field ",
    "the stronger the field , the weaker the damping , except for the axisymmetric transversal and 2d modes .",
    "the former are magnetically overdamped because the incompressibility constraint does not permit an axially uniform radial flow .",
    "the latter , which are transversal modes defined by the spherical harmonics with equal degree and order , @xmath5 , are not affected by the magnetic field because these modes are naturally invariant along the field . in a uniform magnetic field ,",
    "no electric current is induced and , thus , no electromagnetic force acts on such a 2d transversal flow because the associated e.m.f .",
    "is irrotational . because the magnetic damping for all other modes decreases inversely with the square of the field strength ,",
    "the viscous damping may become important in a sufficiently strong magnetic field .",
    "consequently , the relaxation of axisymmetric transversal modes , whose viscous damping is negligible relative to the magnetic one , can be used to determine the electrical conductivity , while the damping of @xmath5 modes can be used to determine the viscosity .",
    "the damping of all other modes is affected by both the viscous and ohmic dissipations .",
    "although the latter reduces inversely with the square of the field strength while the former stays constant , an extremely strong magnetic field may be required for the viscous dissipation to be become dominant .    as an example , let us consider a drop of nickel of @xmath243 in diameter @xmath244 which , at the melting point @xmath245 has the surface tension @xmath246 density @xmath247 the dynamic viscosity @xmath248 and the electrical conductivity @xmath249 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the capillary time scale and frequency of non - magnetic fundamental mode @xmath250 for such a drop are @xmath251 and @xmath252 respectively .",
    "the viscous damping time without the magnetic field ( @xcite ) is @xmath253 , where @xmath254 is the viscous time scale .",
    "note that weak - viscosity approximation is applicable in this case because @xmath255 is small . in the magnetic field of @xmath256 for which @xmath257 the oscillation frequency of longitudinal fundamental mode @xmath131 drops according to equation ( [ sol : bt0-o ] ) to @xmath258 the corresponding viscous damping time increases by the factor of two to @xmath259 where @xmath260 according to table [ tab : bet01-o ] .",
    "the magnetic damping time of this mode , for which ( [ eq : bt1-o ] ) yields @xmath261 is @xmath262 according to this formula , for the magnetic damping time to exceed the viscous one , a magnetic field of @xmath263 is necessary .",
    "the relaxation time for the axisymmetric fundamental mode @xmath264 which is magnetically over - damped , is @xmath265 where @xmath266 follows from ( [ eq : bt1-e ] ) .",
    "the magnetic field affects neither the frequency nor the damping rate of @xmath156 transversal oscillation mode , which is naturally invariant along the field . for the same reason",
    ", there is no magnetic damping of this mode either .",
    "the first oscillatory transversal mode is @xmath158 whose frequency drops according to ( [ sol : bt0-e ] ) from @xmath267 without the magnetic field to @xmath268 in a strong magnetic field .",

    "the viscous damping is small relative to the magnetic one for this mode , and a magnetic field of about @xmath274 would be necessary for the magnetic damping time to become as long as the viscous one .    in conclusion",
