    "notice that the ion density perturbation in this excitation phase is still building up and is a fraction of the background ion density , @xmath5.,width=480 ]    plasma ions are generally assumed to be stationary in the theory of ultra - relativistic non - linear plasma electron waves @xcite .",
    "such electron waves are regularly excited as wakefields of high - intensity energy sources such as an ultra - short laser or particle beams and have proved to be promising for accelerating and transporting beams with unprecedented field strengths @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "important exceptions to the fundamental assumption of stationary ions occur as the intensities of the energy sources become high enough to lead to significant ion motion within a period of the electron wave .",
    "ion motion also invariably becomes important over several periods of the electron wake train further behind the driver as the energy left - over in electron oscillation modes couples to the ion modes .",
    "the motion of ions has significant implications for plasma acceleration as high - intensity conditions occur when the drive beam ( or an accelerated witness beam ) has fields that lead to ion trajectories that are a considerable fraction of the electron oscillation trajectory @xcite@xcite .",
    "these conditions are predicted to arise in the final - stage of ultra - low emittance future plasma - based collider designs at the tev energy scale .",
    "the subject of this paper however is the ion motion at longer timescales , understanding the long - term ion behavior is important to determine the state of the plasma for succeeding bunches in a high repetition rate future plasma - based collider @xcite@xcite .",
    "the work presented here shows that a long - lived ion - mode is leftover in the plasma , establishing an upper - limit on the repetition - rate of the plasma - based accelerators .    in this paper",
    ", using theoretical analysis and computational modeling , the excitation of a nonlinear ion - wake in the trail of a non - linear  bubble \" plasma electron , is shown .",
    "the electron wake may be driven by either an intense laser or particle beam energy source @xcite@xcite .",
    "we show that the time asymmetry of the focusing fields of the bubble leads to the excitation of non - linear ion - acoustic modes in the form of a cylindrical ion - soliton .",
    "the application of the non - linear ion - wake for plasma - based accelerators in  crunch - in \" wakefield regime is explored .",
    "the  crunch - in \" regime of plasma wakefields in an ideal hollow - channel was introduced in @xcite@xcite and ch.8 of @xcite . in this wakefield regime",
    ", it was shown that hollow - channel is driven by energy - sources such that the channel - wall electrons collapse to the axis , driving strong wakefields of the order of channel - wall cold - plasma wave - breaking fields .",
    "importantly , it was also shown that the focusing fields excited in this regime have a linear radial dependence of magnitude ( with direction favorable for positron transport ) and are of the order of accelerating fields @xcite ( fig.2 there - in ) .",
    "the excitation of strong focusing fields in this regime is completely opposite to the conventionally established conclusion that relativistic particles have zero focusing fields in hollow - channels @xcite .",
    "this regime is enabled by the ion - wake channel because it is shown to have an initial radius close to the electron wake transverse size while uniquely its length is as long as the acceleration length . here",
    "we show that the ion - wake channel - wall electrons collapse towards the energy - propagation axis resulting in a non - linear on - axis electron density compression many times the near - void background density . the optimal compression is shown to be only possible if the driving beam properties are matched to the channel radius @xcite , a strong dependence on the excitation which is a signature of non - linearity .",
    "the choice of appropriate channel radius is enabled by launching the driver at an appropriate time , resulting in excitation at an appropriate channel radius during the expansion of the ion - wake channel .",
    "the ion - wake model shows two distinct phases of the non - linear ion - wake : inertial and thermalized phase . in the inertial or excitation phase the time - asymmetry between the attractive and repulsive radial fields of the bubble on the ions excites them into a soliton - like structure .",
    "we show that in this phase the inertial response of the ion rings is dictated by an equilibrium or separatrix radius",
    ". the ion rings located within this radius collapse towards the axis whereas rings outside are driven outwards .",
    "the outward propagating rings are only driven up to the bubble radius beyond which the force of the bubble radial fields rapidly falls off , resulting in the accumulation of the ion rings at the bubble radius .    at later times , the non - linear radial electron oscillations undergo phase mixing @xcite leading to coherent electron motion becoming thermalized . the thermalized phase is shown to be a driven non - linear ion - acoustic wave in the form of a cylindrical ion - acoustic soliton .",
    "its characteristics are similar to the solutions of the cylindrical korteweg - de vries equation ( ckdv ) @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "however , the ion - wake shown here differs from a cylindrical - kdv soliton in several aspects : ( a ) the bubble wake electron oscillations do not thermalize into an isothermal plasma , so the ion - wake soliton is driven ( or forced ) by the electron temperature gradient ; ( b ) the ion - wake soliton breaks up into n - solitons as it evolves and ( c ) at early times there is an ion - density spike on the axis which collapses at a later time .",
    "the soliton propagates radially outwards leaving behind a flat residue resulting in a near - void ion - wake channel .",
    "representative pic simulation results in fig.[fig1:ion - wake - laser ] and fig.[fig2:ion - wake - beam ] illustrate the salient features of the non - linear ion - wake .",
    "figure [ fig1:ion - wake - laser ] shows the excitation phase at an early time when the bubble wake - train is still executing orderly oscillations and its fields have begun to excite inertial ion motion resulting in a soliton - like ion - wake structure ( @xmath6 ) as seen in fig.[fig1:ion - wake - laser](b),(c ) . at later times as shown in fig.[fig2:ion - wake - beam ] the radial oscillations sustaining the bubble train have phase - mixed , converting much of the wave energy into electron thermal energy .",
    "the resulting electron thermal pressure drives the ion - soliton ( @xmath7 ) outwards .",
    "the time evolution of the radial dynamics of the ion rings driven by the time - asymmetric nonlinear electron is shown in a movie in supplementary material @xcite .",
    "we show below , it is the longitudinal or time asymmetry of the radial electron wakefields that excites the ion soliton which propagates leaving behind a near - void channel shown in the pic simulations in fig.[fig1:ion - wake - laser ] and fig.[fig2:ion - wake - beam ] .    , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , these beam - plasma parameters are quite similar to @xcite .",

    "using the fact that the thermalizing electron wakefield is non - isothermal with radial electron temperature gradients , we model the non - linear ion - acoustic waves as a driven cylindrical ion soliton .",
    "we use an analytical model based on fields of a non - linear plasma wave and simulations to demonstrate the inertial phase of the ion - wake in section [ ion - soliton - excitation - phase ] . in section [ ion - soliton - propagation - phase ] the propagation phase of the ion - wake is analytical modeled with simulations verifying the propagation of the cylindrical ion - soliton driven by the radial temperature gradient of the phase - mixed electrons .",
    "finally , in section [ ion - soliton - positron - wake ] we introduce and analyze the properties of  crunch - in \" wakefield regime in an ion - wake channel , using analytical model and simulations . in appendix [ ion - wake - model - considerations ]",
    "we present considerations and assumptions made to derive the ion - wake model .",
    "to develop insight into the ion wake physics , we consider the 1-d simplified dispersion relation of the ion - acoustic plane waves ,    @xmath13    where , @xmath14 and @xmath15 under the collision - less condition , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the adiabatic index with @xmath18 being the degrees of freedom of the ions .    at early times",
    "the ion motion is dominated by inertia , thus ions move over the plasma - ion timescales when driven by time varying and asymmetric fields of non - linear electron plasma - wave .",
    "as the ion inertia leads to very small spatial displacement scales @xmath19 , the term @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is the debye wavelength ) .",
    "thus , @xmath22 and the ion - soliton density spikes grow over the plasma - ion frequency timescales , @xmath23 .",
    "the radial electron oscillations sustaining the bubble undergo phase - mixing , the electron trajectories lose orderly motion and thermalize . as the electrons thermalize",
    ", the ion motion is driven by thermal pressure of electrons .    when the ions gain significant momentum and start oscillating over larger spatial scales in response to the electron dynamics then @xmath24 .",
    "in this thermally driven phase , the acoustic wave propagation becomes dispersion - less with @xmath25 .    an ion - acoustic wave growing in amplitude undergoes self - steepening , forming a density spike over much smaller spatial scales ; @xmath26 becomes large while dispersion becomes important .",
    "the ion - wake modeled here is non - linear , thus the large @xmath26 dispersion relation retaining the higher - order terms in @xmath26 in the taylor series expansion of eq.[ion - wave - dispersion - relation ] , is , @xmath27 .    also ,",
    "at much later times , the ions undergo heating ; @xmath28 increases and modifies the sound speed to @xmath29 .      .",
    "the bubbles just behind the driver in fig .",
    "3a undergo phase - mixing over several cycles .",
    "the intermediate stages of the extent of phase - mixing can be inferred from the bubbles that are closer to the beam .",
    "the beam - plasma parameters are the same as in fig.[fig2:ion - wake - beam ] but the electron - wake is shown at an earlier time @xmath30 . ,",
    "width=480 ]    in this section , we derive the wave equation for the ion - wake in the linear fluid approximation driven by two terms : the electron wakefields and the electron thermal pressure .",
    "the linear ion - acoustic wave can be obtained by perturbative expansion of ion density , @xmath31 and ion fluid velocity @xmath32 in the zeroth - order ion fluid continuity equation , @xmath33 . taking a partial derivative with time , @xmath34 .",
    "the ion - fluid equation of motion where the electron temperature ( @xmath35 ) has a spatial gradient and electron wakefields ( @xmath36 ) still persist is , @xmath37 .",
    "the assumption of spatial gradient of electron temperature has been used because electron plasma wave oscillations phase - mix into non - isothermal plasma ( this is substantiated through numerical results in the simulations section in fig.[fig5:elec - temperature - profile ] ) . upon substituting the equation of motion in the time - derivative of the linearized continuity equation , @xmath38 .",
    "thus , a driven ion - acoustic wave linearized to the first - order in density perturbation has the form ,    @xmath39    in this first - order approximate ion - fluid model the right - hand side of eq.[ion - wave - equation - first - order ] shows two separate timescales of the ion - wake .    at earlier times , the first term on the right - hand side dominates .",
    "this is the _ formation or inertial _ phase of the ion - wake where the bubble electron oscillations undergo ordered radial motion and the bubble radial electric field excites the inertial response of the ions .",
    "the group velocity of the electron bubble wake ( @xmath40 , in the 1-d limit , where , @xmath41 is the mean electron thermal velocity @xcite ) is much smaller than the phase velocity so the bubble fields interact with the background plasma over several oscillations .",
    "fig.[fig3:bubble - train ] shows the non - linear electron - wake train ( electron density in real space in [ fig3:bubble - train](a ) ) and its time - asymmetric fields ( longitudinal [ fig3:bubble - train](b ) and radial [ fig3:bubble - train](c ) ) driven by a near speed - of - light energy - source of high - intensity .",
    "the fields lead to the formation of the on - axis and @xmath42 ion density spikes . at later times after the phase - mixing between radial oscillators the electrons thermalize and @xmath43 .",
    "this is the _ propagation or thermal _ phase where the electron thermal pressure gradient drives the cylindrical soliton around @xmath42 radially outwards to many times @xmath42 .",
    "eq.[ion - wave - equation - first - order ] is not directly solved as it can be separated over the two different timescales . in the inertial or excitation phase when the plasma is cold ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) ,",
    "a better description is provided by an ion - ring model driven by the fields of the electron wave .",
    "the ion - ring model is developed and verified using pic simulations in section [ ion - soliton - excitation - phase ] .",
    "the thermally - driven propagation phase is modeled as a driven ion - acoustic soliton and verified by pic simulations in section [ ion - soliton - propagation - phase ] .    before proceeding to the solutions in the two time - scales ,",
    "we illustrate the time - scale separation using pic simulation snapshot over tens of electron oscillations behind the driver in fig .",
    "[ fig3:bubble - train ] .",
    "in the fig .",
    "[ fig3:bubble - train ] ( a ) the coherent motion in the first four or five oscillations behind the driver is evident ; whereas further behind the driver , the electrons begin to de - cohere due to phase - mixing .",
    "the falling - off of the electron wakefields to nearly zero as the electrons thermalize is later shown using pic simulations over a much longer time - scale in sec .",
    "[ ion - soliton - propagation - phase ] ( see fig.[fig6:ion - motion - lineouts](b ) where the radial electric field goes to zero around 200@xmath46 and the ion - soliton is seen moving outwards radially in [ fig6:ion - motion - lineouts](a ) ) .",
    "since the characteristic time of ion - motion is much longer than the electron oscillations , the longitudinal field @xmath47 averages out over the full bubble electron oscillation .",
    "so , the ions gain relatively small net longitudinal momentum .",
    "however , atypical radial ion - dynamics arise because the radial fields , @xmath48 are asymmetric in time as shown in fig.[fig4:bubble - ion - dynamics ] and do not average to zero , driving an average radial ion - momentum .",

    "the short driver impulses are neglected ( below threshold intensity for direct non - linear ion excitation @xcite@xcite ) ) because they act on the ions over their sub - wavelength short duration .",

    "the validity of this assumption is evident from the laser ion - wake in fig.[fig1:ion - wake - laser ] .",
    "since the ponderomotive force of a laser driver is an outward force for both the electrons and ions , the on - axis density - spike can not be from this direct force from the laser .",
    "similarly the ion - density - spike at the radial wake - edge in an electron beam driven ion - motion can not be excited directly by the space - charge force of the beam , and is caused by the electron wake s radial - edge density compression .",

    "the bared - ion region inside the bubble is assumed to be a positively charged cylinder under steady - state approximation ( @xmath63 , back of the bubble electron compression radius ) .",
    "the force on the ions from the non - linear electron compression @xmath64 in the back of the bubble and radius @xmath65 , pulls the ion rings towards the axis ; and within the bubble , the mutual space - charge force of the ion - rings leads to the ion - rings being driven outwards , away from the axis . the `` suck - in '' force on the ions is @xmath66 .",

    "when the radially outward moving ion - rings reach beyond @xmath42 , there is excess net negative charge of the wake electrons within the bubble - sheath . as a result",
    "the radially propagating ion rings get trapped and start accumulating just inside the bubble - sheath and can not freely move beyond , forming a density compression at @xmath42 .",

    "there are several considerations and assumptions that underlie the non - linear ion - wake model . here",
    "we briefly describe these and seek to differentiate the ion - wake from other phenomena .",
    "primarily , we establish that the ion - wake is a collision - less phenomena and it is significantly different from diffusion . secondly , as the ion - wake is formed behind the high phase - velocity non - linear electron plasma waves that are excited as the wakefields of near speed of light energy sources , it is significantly different from hole - boring which occurs in a plasma where the energy source has nearly zero group velocity .",
    "we recognize that to study the time evolution of a wake - excited plasma , for establishing the duration over which it relaxes to thermal equilibrium , both collisional and collision - less dynamics have to be considered along with the physics of recombination modes such as electron - ion recombination .",
    "however , in this work the dynamics of plasma is modeled under the collision - less approximation .",
    "thus , diffusion is not important during the timescales over which the ion - wake is studied . we do not discuss recombination except mentioning that the  afterglow \" is dominated by volume recombination while localized effects can not be ruled out .    in order to formally establish the difference between the density wave processes that occur over collision - less timescale in contrast to the ones that start dominating under collisions , we show the assumptions made to arrive at the dynamics of diffusion .",
    "the process of diffusion is modeled with a parabolic partial differential equation which is deduced from the ion - fluid equations under the assumption that the inertial response of the ions is much faster than the collisional timescales .",
    "the effect of collisions is introduced as a drag force , @xmath255 .",
    "the collisional drag force modifies the ion - fluid equation of motion as , @xmath256 where @xmath257 is the average electron - ion collision frequency and is obtained from the mean free path .",
    "diffusion of plasma is thus driven by the charge - separation field , @xmath258 and the thermal pressure , @xmath259 while being impeded by the collisional drag . upon ignoring the inertia of the ions , @xmath260 , the equation for the ion velocity by diffusion in an isothermal plasma is , @xmath261 .",
    "the characteristic parameter of diffusion is the diffusion coefficient or diffusivity @xmath262 and mobility @xmath263 which depend upon the collision frequency . using the gradient of the velocity in the continuity equation and ignoring the mobility @xmath264 , leads to a fick s law diffusion equation , @xmath265 ; characteristic of a parabolic equation .    when the mobility is retained , the fluid equation is a moment of the fokker - planck equation which is the kinetic model of the collision - driven drift and diffusion .",
    "the diffusion equation thus can not support wave - like solution because such solutions are characteristic of a hyperbolic partial differential equation .",
    "the solutions of linear and non - linear diffusion equations show the evolution of density profile by diffusion and can be obtained using the self - similar formulation .",
    "the self - similar solutions show the spatial and temporal evolution of the density to be exponentially decaying . in the non - linear case",
    ", the density can have a sharp - front as it decays .",
    "however , a soliton - like propagating solution can not be described with diffusion equation .",
    "hence , the cylindrical ion - soliton presented here is not diffusion but a wave phenomenon .",
    "the electron bubble wake is excited by a sub - wavelength impulse of an ultra - short driver .",
    "in contrast , the ion - wake is excited as the ions undergo sustained interactions with the bubble fields within the spatial extent of the wake over several plasma electron oscillations .",
    "this happens because the electron wake - plasmon oscillations @xcite have a near speed - of - light phase - velocity ( @xmath266 ) but negligible group - velocity @xcite @xmath40 ( in the 1-d limit ) , where , @xmath41 is the mean electron thermal velocity of the background plasma .",
    "therefore a slowly - propagating train of coupled electron plasmons is excited in a cold collision - less plasma @xcite .",
    "a large difference between phase - velocity and the group velocity of the electron oscillations allows sustained field - ion interactions .",
    "it should be noted that high phase - velocity plasma electron waves are possible only in a cold plasma with appropriate density , @xmath150 that allows near speed - of - light propagation of the energy sources , @xmath267 .",
    "ion - soliton modeled here is assuming a significant difference between the phase - velocity and the group velocity of the plasma - electron waves .    a time symmetric electron wakefield would excite time symmetric ion oscillations where the ion velocities average to zero . however , the bubble wake is asymmetric in time as the back of the bubble electron compression is a small fraction of the length of electron cavitation .",
