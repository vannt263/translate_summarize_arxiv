    "magnesium - zinc - yttrium alloys with zn : y ratios @xmath16 precipitate an icosahedral quasi - crystalline phase ( i - phase ) with composition @xmath2@xcite .",
    "the binary mg - zn phases formed in these alloys play a key role in the precipitation strengthening of both commercial ( zk series ) and experimental magnesium alloys . aside from their industrial importance , two of these phases , monoclinic and hexagonal , contain zinc - centred icosahedral atomic clusters .",
    "this structural similarity to the i - phase has lead to these phases being used as structural models for the quasi - crystalline phase @xcite .",
    "the phase ( a=2.596 nm , b=0.524 nm , c=1.428 nm , @xmath3 @xcite ) has been shown to be structurally related to the i - phase @xcite and to the decagonal phase in mg - zn - y alloys @xcite and can co - exist with the decagonal phase with the orientation relationship @xmath4 d2a(g)\\parallel[-401]$ ] ; and @xmath5 $ ] . in mg - zn alloys the phase adopts an axial orientation @xmath6_\\ce{mg4zn7 } \\parallel [ 0001]_{\\mathrm{mg}}$ ] .",
    "matching between precipitate and matrix lattice planes is more complex , with reports of @xmath7 planes being aligned with the @xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 planes @xcite .",
    "the relationship @xmath11 has also been reported @xcite .",
    "it has recently been suggested that two orientation relationships ; @xmath6_\\ce{mg4zn7 } \\parallel [ 0001]_{\\mathrm{mg}}$ ] with @xmath12 or @xmath13 may be sufficient to describe the relationship between the precipitate and matrix @xcite .",
    "the phase ( a=0.52 nm , c = 0.85 nm @xcite has a @xmath14 hexagonal laves phase structure and generally forms as plate - shaped precipitates on extended ageing . in this form",
    "it adopts an orientation relationship @xmath15_{\\mathrm{mg}}\\parallel [ 0001]_{\\ce{mgzn2 } } $ ] ; @xmath16 @xcite .",

    "a recent work has reported that a c15 cubic laves phase can also be found inside @xmath18precipitates along with the previously reported hexagonal ( c14 ) structure .",
    "the transformation between the two phases was explained in terms of a synchroshear mechanism whereby the stacking sequence of several layers within the hexagonal phase underwent simultaneous displacements in the basal plane @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that the and phases can co - exist in mg - zn - y alloys in both rod - shaped precipitates ( commonly termed @xmath18 ) @xcite and larger , roughly spheroidal twin - boundary precipitates @xcite .",
    "the co - existence of these phases within individual precipitates reconciles conflicting reports on rod - shaped precipitates in mg - zn(-y ) alloys which have been described as either @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the - interface was described as a largely continuous patterning of rhombohedral units whose corners corresponded to the location of the icosahedrally coordinated zinc atoms @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the locations of the centres of the clusters remain consistent across the interface , but did not address the issue of the location of the surrounding atoms .",
    "these studies were conducted on mg - zn - y alloys and while yttrium has not been detected in either rod or shaped precipitates @xcite , it was not possible to conclusively rule out yttrium playing a role in altering the structures of or .",

    "cylindrical samples machined from the rod were encapsulated in helium , solution treated ( 400 or 300 @xmath19 , respectively , for 1h ) and quenched in water .",
    "these samples were either aged directly or alternatively compressed parallel to the extrusion direction to 3% plastic strain at a strain rate of @xmath20 prior to ageing .",
    "this process of extrusion and compression served to generate deformation twins in the magnesium matrix which acted as additional nucleation sites .",
    "twins were extremely rare ( @xmath21 by volume ) in equivalent samples not subjected to compressive deformation .",
    "ageing was conducted at 150@xmath19 in an oil bath for periods from 8h to 216h .",

    "@xcite , however , in the absence of images along several additional zone axes it was not possible to definitively identify this phase .",

    "the simulations ( figures [ simulations](b , d , f ) ) predict local intensity maxima at mg sites close to the centres of the rhombohedra these are observable in some regions of the experimental images , for example to the right in the c14 and monoclinic phase images ( fig .",
    "[ simulations](a , e ) ) in other regions and in the proposed c15 structure , weaker spots occur at many sites midway between the strong intensity sites ( i.e. the midpoints of the edges of the rhombohedra , where a zn atom is located in each structure . )",
    "this suggests that while the rhombohedral sites are well - ordered there may be disorder , perhaps including mixed - occupancy at other sites .",

    "two differently oriented variants of the structure were present in the hrtem image and the constituent icosahedra in each phase share common ors with those in the two laves phases .",

    "the co - existence of hexagonal and phases as has recently been shown in ternary mg - zn - y alloys @xcite , however binary mg - zn alloys had not been examined and it was not possible to preclude yttrium from playing a role in the formation of these dual - phase precipitates . on the basis that co - existing ( hexagonal )  - precipitates are also found in mg - zn alloys ( as in figure  [ fig - hrtem-1 ] ) it can be argued that this phenomenon is not dependent on the presence of yttrium .    despite the structural similarities between the i - phase and the and phases , at present",
    "there is no evidence to suggest that the rod - like or twin - boundary precipitates are ternary in nature .",
    "similar arrangements of edge - sharing icosahedra were observed in binary and ternary alloys .",
    "previous studies have not detected yttrium or rare earth elements in the matrix or dendrites @xcite in mg - zn-(re / y ) alloys .",

    "emprical values give @xmath55 , close to the limits found for laves phases .",
    "in addition , the ternary elements which were found to be soluble in a laves phase were those with metallic radii between those of the two major elements . in the present system , however , yttrium ( 180pm ) is larger in diameter that either mg ( 150pm ) or zn ( 135pm ) .",
    "instead yttrium , which is only moderately soluble in magnesium , is thought to segregate to the grain boundaries in the form of grain boundary precipitates such as the quasi - crystalline @xmath56-phase @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "precipitates in mg - zn - y alloys have been reported to form domains of the cubic and hexagonal phases @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the transformation between the two phases could be described by a process of synchroshear parallel to the basal plane of the hexagonal phase in a process recognised for other laves phases @xcite .",
    "recent work on twin - boundary precipitates in mg - zn - y alloys has shown that and hexagonal phases can co - exist with the interface comprised of a transitional structure similar to , but with the addition of additional rhombohedral units @xcite .",
    "studies of intragranular precipitates showed co - existence of the and phases at a much finer scale , with a largely continuous network of rhombohedra forming either phase @xcite . in each cases the interfaces could be described by edge - sharing rhombohedra , allowing the two phases to maintain good correspondence between the locations of the zinc - centred icosahedral forming the corners of the rhombohedral arrangement .",
    "planar defects along which the orientation of the rhombohedra changed marked the boundaries between micro - domains of each phase .    the cubic and hexagonal laves phase structures and the monoclinic phase contain similar co - ordination clusters , consisting of 12-coordinate zinc - centred icosahedra . in the present work ,",
    "analysis of the hrtem images showed that hexagonal and domains in twin - boundary and rod - shaped precipitates were aligned so that at least one series of these constituent icosahedra clusters also shared a common alignment .",
    "this alignment would also be shared by icosahedral clusters in regions adopting a c15 cubic laves phase structure . for an interface formed in such a manner",
    ", the peripheral atoms in the icosahedral clusters would share common positions .",
    "the existence of a network of icosahedrally coordinated zinc atoms ( as indicated by the continuous rhombohedral arrangement of these atomic sites ) with similarly oriented icosahedral clusters at the interface would permit a high correspondence of atomic sites at a suitably aligned - interface .",
    "this degree of atomic correspondence would allow domains of the two phases to co - exist without large displacements of the peripheral atoms in the clusters .",
    "in essence , the first co - ordination shell remains the same across the interface , with rearrangements occurring at second - nearest neighbour positions .",
    "this feature may explain the apparently ready co - existence of the laves and monoclinic phases .",
    "both intragranular precipitates and precipitates formed on twin - boundaries in mg - zn and mg - zn - y alloys were investigated via high - resolution transmission electron microscopy . precipitates on twin - boundaries in both binary and ternary alloys were comprised of domains with the structures of the and hexagonal phases .",
    "these phases had a rational orientation relationship with on another and with the magnesium matrix , such that @xmath15_\\mathrm{mgzn_2 } \\parallel   [ 010]_\\ce{mg4zn7 } \\parallel [ 0001]_\\mathrm{mg}$ ] ; @xmath58 .",
    "intragranular , rod - shaped precipitates contained finer domains , with small regions having the structures of the and hexagonal ( c14 ) phases , with some suggestion of a cubic c15 phase .",
    "an analysis of the twin - boundary and intragranular phases showed that a high proportion of the icosahedral clusters in each phase shared a common alignment with one another in which either 2-fold or 5-fold axes were parallel to the hexad axis of the magnesium matrix .",
    "this orientation relationship between the clusters permits a high correspondence between atomic sites at the - interface and may contribute to the ability of the and to co - exist at a nanometre scale .",
