    "the modeling of systems involving many dynamical units connected by a complex network of interactions is a topic of increasing interest in many scientific domains , such as neuroscience @xcite , genetics @xcite , epidemiology @xcite , artificial intelligence @xcite or social sciences @xcite ( see also @xcite for a comprehensive overview ) . in these systems , depending on the nature of the interactions one can observe various complex phenomena such as the order - disorder phase transition in spin - glasses , the propagation of an epidemic or the emergence of complex dynamics in neural networks models . in general , understanding the emerging properties of such systems relies on the combination of three main factors : ( i ) the structure of the connectivity network , ( ii ) the way units interact with each other and ( iii ) the dynamical properties of single units .",
    "one of the main theoretical challenges in this line of research is to unravel the subtle links between these three factors .    a particular question of interest concerns the relationship between the degree distribution of a weighted graph and the properties of a system of interacting non - linear dynamical units on such a graph .",
    "for example , this topic has been studied recently in the context of synchronization phenomenon , showing the importance of the degree distribution for characterizing the transition to the synchronous state @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a discrete - time non - linear neural network model which is used in various artificial intelligence applications based on artificial neural networks , and corresponds to the class of firing - rate models commonly used in computational neuroscience . despite its apparent simplicity",
    ", this model provides an interesting theoretical framework to study analytically the influence of the structure of the connectivity on the dynamical properties of the system .",
    "the study of this class of models on fully connected random networks @xcite through the mean - field approach reveals a phase - transition between stable steady states and chaotic dynamics in the limit of infinite networks .",
    "however , the impact of an underlying graph structure on such random weights models has not been studied so far . in this situation",
    ", the classical mean - field approach needs to be augmented with ideas coming from the field of theoretical epidemiology , where several authors have suggested to group nodes by their in - degrees @xcite giving rise to the emerging method called heterogeneous mean - field theory . in this article",
    ", we develop upon this approach constructing an original method to derive consistent equations governing the variability of the network nodes .",
    "a consequence of our theoretical analysis is that regular graphs are shown to enhance the variability of such dynamical systems , while making the system more homogeneous in terms of network topology .",
    "we also show how to quantify the complexity of the system s attractors , by explicitly computing the largest lyapunov exponents of the system .    in section [ sec : hmf ] , we introduce formally our model and present an analytical study of a classical recurrent neural network model . in section [ sec : simus ] , we provide numerical simulations verifying and extending the results to other systems , such as networks of interacting fitzhugh - nagumo neurons .",
    "here we develop an original analytical approach , which we dub heterogeneous mean - field ( hmf ) theory , for the study of randomly connected recurrent neural networks .",
    "consider a directed graph @xmath0 with @xmath1 nodes , and an in - degree distribution @xmath2 .",
    "we denote @xmath3 $ ] the rescaled in - degree and assumes that in the large @xmath1 limit , @xmath4 , called the rescaled in - degree distribution ( the typical in - degree of a node is assumed to be of order @xmath1 ) .",
    "we further make the assumption of no correlation between in- and out - degree . to our knowledge",
    "the question of assortative mixing properties of anatomical neuronal networks has not been fully elucidated so far @xcite , and remains a question of current research . on each edge @xmath5 , one assigns a weight @xmath6 , which are independent centered random variables with finite variances , which may depend on the in - degree @xmath7 of node @xmath8 : @xmath9 = \\sigma^2_{\\alpha}/n$ ] .",
    "we consider the following dynamical system on this weighted di - graph : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an odd sigmoid function with @xmath12 , @xmath13,@xmath14 and @xmath15 ( for instance @xmath16 in a popular choice in the literature ) .",
    "this model can be seen as a dynamical version of a zero - temperature spin - glass model @xcite and has been studied in the context of neural networks in @xcite in the case where the graph is fully connected , i.e. @xmath17 .",
    "+      here , we study the previous system deriving a self - consistent equation characterizing the variance of the nodes variables @xmath18 , showing how a combination of the degree distribution @xmath19 and the variance profile @xmath20 controls the transition from a stable null equilibrium to a disordered state .    in the case of a general weighted graph ,",
    "the overall strategy we introduce is to combine the classical mean - field approach @xcite with the idea of partitioning the nodes according to their rescaled degree @xmath7 , at the heart of the heterogeneous mean - field ( hmf ) theory developed in the field of epidemiology @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath8 is a node with rescaled degree @xmath7 and denote @xmath21 the variance of @xmath18 and @xmath22 .",
    "this sum contains only @xmath23 terms , which come from nodes with various degree , and not only from nodes of degree @xmath7 .",
    "the main idea of hmf is that these terms effectively sample the overall behavior of the system .",
    "then the key step in the classical mean - field approach is to assume the independence between the @xmath24 s and @xmath25 ( mean - field assumption ) .",
    "this has been rigorously justified in @xcite using large deviation techniques when adding an arbitrary small white - noise term on , but remains an open problem in the zero - noise case . under the mean - field assumption ,",
    "one deduces that @xmath26 behaves as a centered gaussian variable with variance @xmath27 where @xmath28 from the iteration equation @xmath29 , we further deduce : @xmath30 with @xmath31 combining the above equations , we obtain : @xmath32 an interesting case occurs when choosing a specific type of non - linear activation function @xmath11 . indeed ,",
    "when @xmath33 , it is possible to compute explicitly the gaussian integral defining function @xmath34 , yielding : @xmath35 therefore , if one considers for instance a distribution @xmath19 which is the sum of two dirac deltas @xmath36 , where @xmath37 $ ] , one obtains an explicit update equation for the variance : @xmath38 further assuming a constant variance profile @xmath39 .      therefore , to understand the order - disorder phase transition in this system , the first step is to study the dynamical system @xmath40",
    "due to the properties of the sigmoid function @xmath11 , the function @xmath34 is increasing , concave and satisfies @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we then deduce that @xmath43 is also increasing , concave and satisfies @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , beyond the trivial equilibrium @xmath45 , the existence of another non - trivial equilibrium for will depend on the value of the slope at zero : @xmath46 therefore , @xmath47 converges to @xmath48 if @xmath49 , and @xmath47 converges to a limit value @xmath50 if @xmath51 . for instance , in the classical case of a complete graph with homogeneous variances , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , so the critical condition becomes @xmath54 as expected . in the case of a regular graph with rescaled degree @xmath55 ( each node has @xmath56 incoming edges ) with homogeneous variances , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ,",
    "so the critical variance parameter becomes @xmath59 . in the case of a general degree distribution with homogeneous variances @xmath53 for all",
    "@xmath60 $ ] , one obtains that the critical value of @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the mean rescaled degree . finally , among all the possible choices of @xmath64 , the case @xmath65 is particularly interesting since the critical value is always @xmath54 , whatever the choice of @xmath66 , as one would have expected .",
    "this choice might correspond to the concept of synaptic scaling @xcite , ensuring that the overall input coming to a given unit has a typical strength independent of its in - degree .",
    "the critical parameter @xmath67 can be seen as a weighted average of the rescaled degrees , and in the case of a homogeneous variance profile is precisely proportional to the averaged rescaled degree @xmath68 . in this case , it is natural to investigate the impact of the rescaled degree higher moments , such as its variance @xmath69 , on the value of the fixed point @xmath70 characterizing the disordered state .",
    "it is not possible in general to obtain a closed form expression of @xmath70 , however close to the transition , @xmath43 can be approximated by @xmath71 with @xmath72 given above , and @xmath73 since @xmath74 .",
    "restricting the analysis to the homogeneous variances case , that is @xmath53 , we introduce a small parameter @xmath75 and obtain : @xmath76 @xmath77 therefore , for a given mean - degree @xmath63 , this formula implies that increasing the variance @xmath69 will decrease the variability @xmath70 of the neural activity variables , implying that regular graphs maximize @xmath70 when the mean - degree is kept fixed .",
    "in fact , it is also possible to compute the @xmath78 term in the expansion of @xmath79 and one finds : @xmath80      to further characterize the non - trivial attractors in the disordered phase , it is of interest to estimate the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath81 , as in @xcite , which is below 1 in the case of a steady state , equal to 1 in the case of a limit cycle and larger than 1 in the case of a chaotic attractor . to this end",
    ", we consider two solutions of ( 1 ) starting from two different initial conditions such that @xmath82 . denoting @xmath83",
    ", we have : @xmath84 therefore , if node @xmath8 has a rescaled in - degree @xmath7 , one obtains the following relationship on the variances : @xmath85 with @xmath86 integrating with respect to the degree distribution , we obtain : @xmath87 with @xmath88 on the attractor , @xmath89 so we deduce that @xmath90 from this formula , one deduce , as expected , that in the subcritical regime @xmath91 because @xmath48 and @xmath92 . in the supercritical regime , it is natural to wonder whether @xmath81 will also be a decreasing function of @xmath69 .",
    "the answer is not straightforward because the distribution @xmath19 appears in @xmath81 both explicitly in formula and implicitly through the dependence of @xmath93 . denoting @xmath94 and @xmath75 , we know that @xmath95 when @xmath96",
    "therefore , from a taylor expansion of @xmath97 around zero , we obtain : @xmath98 when substituting @xmath99 with its expression , one discovers that @xmath100 disappears in the @xmath101 term , and appears next in the @xmath78 term : @xmath102 the first consequence of this formula is that , at first order close to the transition , the dynamical complexity of the trajectories as measured by the lyapunov exponent , does not depend on the higher order moments of the degree distribution .",
    "this means that @xmath69 controls the variability of the variables @xmath24 without modifying complexity of the chaotic attractor .",
    "this is true only at first order in @xmath103 , and the dependence of the lyapunov exponent is expressed through a more complicated parameter @xmath104 , which accounts for the higher moments of the rescaled degree distribution , beyond the variance .",
    "we have tested the theoretical predictions of the mean - field theory by numerical simulations , in particular the claim that regular graphs should maximize the variability of the nodes variables . to this end , we construct random weighted graphs with a prescribed degree distribution @xmath105 , by selecting half of the nodes to have an in - degree @xmath106 and the other half with an in - degree @xmath107 . we have chosen this distribution because it combines simplicity with the ability to manipulate the variance of the in - degrees without changing the average . indeed , in this setting , the average rescaled degree @xmath63 is kept constant at @xmath108 , while the variance @xmath69 depends on @xmath109 as @xmath110 . to measure the variability of the node variables , we compute the temporal average of the instantaneous variances of @xmath18 : @xmath111 where @xmath112 .",
    "results are summarized in figure 1 , where the estimated variance @xmath113 is displayed against the variance of the rescaled degree @xmath69 , showing that the variability of the node variables is maximal when the graph is regular .",
    "the fairly good agreement between the numerical simulations and the values predicted by the theory ( computed with equation ) hence provides a strong support for the theoretical calculations obtained in section 2 , even if the simulation was done away from the order - disorder transition ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "[ fig:1 ]     and numerically estimated variance @xmath113 as a function of the in - degree variance @xmath69 .",
    "parameters @xmath115 , @xmath116 . the family of in - degree distribution chosen here is @xmath117 , and the parameter @xmath109 is varied between @xmath118 and @xmath119 to generate networks with different variances @xmath120 of the in - degree distribution.,width=529 ]      the results obtained so far are only focused on a specific , yet important for various applications , neural network model , and it is legitimate to investigate whether the results extend to other models . in particular , it is natural to check if the qualitative phenomenon of maximal variability for regular graphs presented above still holds when the dynamical model of the nodes is different .",
    "therefore , in order to assess the generality of our results , we now consider a system of randomly connected fitz - hugh nagumo ( fhn ) @xcite dynamical units .",
    "in contrast with system , fhn units display the ability to generate action potentials , hence being closer to biological neurons behavior .",
    "more precisely , we consider the following system : @xmath121 where @xmath122 represents the state of neuron @xmath8 , for @xmath123 , and @xmath124 are real parameters . in figure 2 , we display the empirical variability of the variables @xmath125 as a function of the variance of the in - degree distribution , keeping the choice @xmath117 for the sake of comparison , showing again that the variance is maximal when the network is regular .",
    "this numerical simulation supports the idea that , qualitatively , the phenomenon at stake does not depend much on the precise dynamical model , but is more a property of the underlying graph . nevertheless , although decreasing , the shape of the curve displayed in figure [ fig:2 ] is significantly different from the one displayed in figure [ fig:1 ] : the impact of the in - degree distribution seems to be important only when the variance gets close to the maximal value @xmath126 corresponding to a network with half of the nodes having almost @xmath1 incoming inputs and the other half having almost zero incoming input . understanding this specific profile would require an extension of the hmf theory to such non - linear interacting systems , for which the classical homogeneous mean - field theory still remains a complicated task .",
    "[ fig:2 ]     for the system of randomly coupled fitzhugh - nagumo units , as a function of the in - degree variance .",
    "the family of in - degree distribution chosen here is @xmath117 , and the parameter @xmath109 is varied between @xmath118 and @xmath119 to generate networks with different variances @xmath120 of the in - degree distribution .",
    "parameters @xmath127 , @xmath116 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131.,width=529 ]    beyond the specific choice of the dynamical model for the neuron dynamics , a second limitation of our approach concerns the hypothesis made on the degree distribution .",
    "in particular , we assume that the degree distribution converges to the rescaled degree distribution in the large @xmath1 asymptotic .",
    "this assumption means that the typical number of incoming connections at each neuron is required to be of order @xmath1 . in our setting",
    ", one can not consider a network with a lot of neurons having very few incoming connections , for instance of order @xmath132 .",
    "for those units , the number of incoming connections would be too small to apply , somehow , the central limit theorem which is at the heart , though hidden , of the mean - field theory .",
    "understanding how this type of system would impact the hmf theory is a subject of future research .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that neural networks defined over regular graphs lead to a higher activity variability than those defined over irregular graphs .",
    "this somewhat counter - intuitive result illustrates that more homogeneity in the definition of a dynamical system does not necessarily lead to more order in the resulting dynamics . to obtain this result ,",
    "we have developed upon the heterogeneous mean - field theory , providing general equations describing the statistical behavior of the neuronal population , showing a good agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "moreover , we have also shown that the effect of increasing the variance of the network while increasing regularity does not interact strongly with the stability of the attractor whose largest lyapunov exponent remains almost constant .",
    "therefore , selecting the properties of the connectivity graph may provide a way to control the variability of a neural representation without influencing much its dynamical complexity or its sensitivity to small external perturbations ."
