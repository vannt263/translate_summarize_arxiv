    "the need for accurate predictions of pedestrian behavior is rapidly growing , due to the constant increase of urban populations worldwide and to the strengthening of safety regulations imposed to buildings and public areas . yet there is no consensus about what model of pedestrian behavior is the most appropriate .",
    "this is probably due to the difficulty of precisely assessing the validity of models in an unambiguous way . indeed , in natural conditions ,",
    "many factors which are difficult to entangle may influence pedestrian behavior , such as the environment , the topology of the premises , the social and psychological state of the pedestrians , etc . on the other hand ,",
    "the design of experiments in fully controlled situations is costly , time - consuming and strongly impeded by experimental constraints .",
    "many models of pedestrian dynamics have been proposed in the literature .",
    "a recent review on crowd modeling can be found in @xcite .",
    "a vast majority of the models are based on individual - based models ( ibm ) , which describe the behavior of each pedestrian and its interactions with the neighboring pedestrians individually .",
    "such models can be roughly categorized as follows .",
    "there are models based on e.g. heuristic rules @xcite , mechanical models @xcite , optimal control theory models , @xcite , cellular - automata @xcite and vision - based models @xcite .",
    "all these models partially reproduce the behavior of real crowds , each of them having its pros and cons .",
    "one of the difficulties in reproducing actual pedestrian dynamics comes from its two - dimensional nature and the fact that the transversal and longitudinal dynamics ( with respect to the walking direction ) combine in a complex way which is hard to desantangle .",
    "collision avoidance manoeuvres by pedestrians involve controls on both their velocity direction and amplitude @xcite , a feature that has already been implemented in some models @xcite . in order to better understand the role of each of these controls , in this paper we consider a one - dimensional configuration where pedestrians walk on line without being able to pass each other .",
    "this situation is a paradigm for narrow corridors @xcite or dense situations where lane form and pedestrians tend to follow a predecessor walking in the same direction @xcite .",
    "moreover , following behavior as observed in one - dimensional experiments can be used for analyzing or modeling two - dimensional situations @xcite .",
    "the study of one - dimensional pedestrian following behavior has also triggered interest for its own sake @xcite .    in this paper , we rely on experimental results using motion capture techniques reported in @xcite to calibrate the parameters of a follow - the - leader model inspired from car traffic @xcite .",
    "however , on the basis of the experimental data , we demonstrate that it is necessary to consider a non - zero time delay in the model , i.e. that the acceleration of a pedestrian at a given time is determined by the relative position and velocity of this pedestrian with respect to his predecessor at an earlier time .",
    "this results in a system of delay differential equations .",
    "it is well known that such delay differential systems may not be stable depending of the choice of the model parameters @xcite . in this paper , we show that , within the range of parameters found from the calibration of the model , the model is actually not stable .",
    "this leads us to introduce some dissipation mechanism in the form of a relaxation of the pedestrian velocity to the average velocity of a certain number of his predecessors .",
    "thanks to the introduction of this additional mechanism , the model becomes well - posed . we numerically show that , with a physically consistent choice of the parameters of the relaxation operator , the model does indeed provide extremely good agreement with the experiments for large pedestrian densities . for lower density",
    "however , it seems that additional mechanisms which are not included in the model are at play .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : data ] we describe the experiments and the filtering method that is applied to the data . in section [ sec : model ] we discuss the model and show that a delay term must be added .",
    "we perform a stability analysis of the resulting delay - differential system and show that a relaxation term must be added to obtain a stable model .",
    "we then estimate the parameters of the model from the experimental data . in section [ sec : results ] we present the result of the so - obtained calibrated model and we assess the quality of the calibration by looking at macroscopic observables such as the statistics of jams .",
    "we show that the model is able to reproduce the experimental data in a very satisfactorily manner .",
    "the paper is concluded by a discusion in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "a technical annex explores how the results of the calibration depends on the data processing parameters and shows that apart from the choice of the cutoff frequency in the data filtering step , they are insensitive to this choice . the cutoff frequency is chosen fo filter out the pedestrian stepping frequency while keeping all phenomena occuring at lower frequencies .",
    "the description of the experimental setup can be found in @xcite .",
    "we recall it briefly for the sake of completeness . in this experiments ,",
    "subjects were instructed to walk in line on a circular path without passing each other .",
    "the trajectory of each pedestrian was recorded using high precision motion capture technology @xcite .",
    "experiments took place in a ring - shaped arena .",
    "the imposed circular path was chosen close to either the inner or the outer boundary of the arena .",
    "this provided a way to modify the density of pedestrians ( another way being by changing the number of subjects enrolled in the experiment ) .",
    "the choice of circular paths was made in order to avoid spurious clogging effects arising at the ends of a rectilinear path when the subjects enter or exit the path .",
    "the trajectories of the pedestrians were reconstructed using data processing methods described in @xcite .    up to @xmath0 subjects",
    "were enrolled in the experiments .",
    "they were volonteers and uninformed of the purpose of the experiment .",
    "they were instructed to walk at their natural pace and forbidden to talk to each other .",
    "the inner and outer radii of the circular arena were respectively @xmath1 and @xmath2 m. the observed average radius of the pedestrians circular trajectory in the experiments using the inner radius was @xmath3 m ( implying an average perimeter of @xmath4 m ) . for the experiments using the outer radius , the respective figures were @xmath5 m and @xmath6 m. table i of @xcite gives a summary of the experimental parameters ( number of subjects , use of inner or outer circle , pedestrian density and number of replications ) .",
    "the typical duration of each replication was @xmath7 minute .",
    "each subject was equipped with 4 markers , one on the left shoulder , two on the right shoulder , and one on the forehead .",
    "the ring - shaped arena was surrounded by @xmath8 infra - red cameras which detected the markers .",
    "a dedicated software converted this information into the three - dimensional coordinates of each marker .",
    "after some processing of the data described in @xcite , the planar two - dimensional coordinates of the barycenter of the four markers of each subject was reconstructed with a frequency of @xmath9 hz .",
    "the experimental data keep records of the planar positions @xmath10 of each pedestrian at sampling times @xmath11 , with a sampling frequency of @xmath9 hz ( i.e. two consecutive sampling times are separated by @xmath12 ) . to exploit the fact that the pedestrians are moving on a circle , we transform the cartesian coordinates @xmath10 into polar coordinates @xmath13 relative to the center of the circle and to some reference axis .",
    "we can then estimate the angular velocity @xmath14 : @xmath15 where dots denote time derivatives and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are approximated by finite differences .",
    "the experimental data are perturbed by quasi - periodic oscillations due to the pedestrian stepping behavior .",
    "we will discard the effect of steps in the models as we are interested in longer time scales where they have no predominant influence .",
    "for this reason , we strongly reduce the amplitude of these oscillations by applying a linear fourth order filter to the position data . in the frequency domain @xmath18 , and for any quantity @xmath19 whose fourier transform in time is denoted by @xmath20 , the resulting filtered quantity @xmath21 has fourier transform @xmath22given by : @xmath23 due to its high order , this filter also reduces the amplitude of the oscillations of the first and second order time - derivatives ( i.e. the velocity and the acceleration of the pedestrians ) .",
    "the cutoff frequency associated to the filter is @xmath24 where @xmath25 satisfies@xmath26 the cutoff frequency is chosen in such a way that as much information in the data is kept as possible . from the experiments , the step period is about @xmath1 s. consequently , the cutoff frequency @xmath27 hz has been chosen .",
    "a study of the influence of the cut - off frequency on the results supports this conclusion ( see section [ subsec : parameterfc ] ) .",
    "the follow - the - leader ( ftl ) model is a microscopic model which describes the individual behavior of each agent and his interactions with his neighbors .",
    "it has been first used in the context of car traffic @xcite .",
    "there are many variants of the ftl model but a fairly common one is written as follows ( adopting notations of polar geometry which are best suited to the experimental setup ) .",
    "we consider @xmath28 pedestrians on the 1d circle with angular positions @xmath29 , and angular velocities @xmath30 , for @xmath31 functions of time @xmath32 .",
    "these quantities evolve according to the following system of delay - differential equations , written for @xmath31 : @xmath33 here @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are modeling constants to be calibrated on the data .",
    "the @xmath37-th pedestrian is the leader of ( i.e. the one exactly before ) the @xmath38-th pedestrian .",
    "this model can be interpreted as follows .",
    "there is a first phase where the pedestrians observes his leader , acquires the knowledge of the quantities @xmath39 and @xmath40 and makes a decision about what reaction should be implemented in response to these observations .",
    "this decision - making is represented by the right - hand side of ( [ eq:2.0 ] ) .",
    "the second phase is the action phase where the pedestrian acts on his own velocity to comply with his decision - making rule .",
    "it is represented by the left - hand side of ( [ eq:2.0 ] ) .",
    "the time delay @xmath41 corresponds to the time needed between the decision and its translation into action .",
    "the decision - making rule itself describes how the pedestrian adjusts his velocity to that of his leader . to this aim",
    ", he decelerates if he is faster than his leader and accelerates if he is slower , in proportion to the speed difference , as shown at the numerator of the right - hand side of ( [ eq:2.0 ] ) .",
    "this adjustment is modulated by the proximity of the pedestrian to his leader , a short distance inducing a stronger reaction , as expressed by the denominator of the right - hand side of ( [ eq:2.0 ] ) .",
    "the constant @xmath42 quantifies the intensity of the reaction and @xmath43 its dependence upon the distance to the leader .",
    "note that @xmath44 is always positive if the pedestrians are moving counterclockwise and always negative if they are moving clockwise . since angles are quantities defined up to the addition of a multiple of @xmath45 , we take for @xmath44 the smallest positive ( respectively largest negative ) quantity among all such possible values .",
    "( in blue ) and @xmath46 ( in red ) as functions of time @xmath32 for a typical pedestrian trajectory .",
    "for the sake of a better representation , both functions are normalized by their maximal value .",
    "we notice that @xmath46 has roughly the same features as @xmath47 with some time delay . ]",
    "while the general ftl model used in traffic incorporates a time - delay @xcite , it has often been neglected in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) . here ,",
    "the experimental data suggest that a non - zero time - delay should be used .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig:70 ] shows the quantities @xmath48 and @xmath49 as functions of time , for a typical pedestrian trajectory . from this figure",
    ", it appears clearly that these quantities are correlated but with some time shift .",
    "this observation is generic : it applies to a large proportion of our experimental data .",
    "then , for the sake of simplicity , we restrict ourselves to @xmath50 and will consider the following model , written for @xmath31 : @xmath51 indeed , later on , it will prove interesting to consider even more general models in which the constants @xmath42 and @xmath41 are density - dependent , which contains the previous model as a particular case .",
    "unfortunately , time - delay differential equations are not always linearly stable .",
    "linear stability means that if a steady - state solution ( here for instance , a solution where all velocities @xmath52 are equal ) is slightly perturbed , the linearized system has bounded solutions . the stability analysis of the ftl model ( [ eq:1 ] ) , ( [ eq : modelcst ] ) has been performed in @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the model is stable if @xmath53 . with the values of @xmath42 and @xmath41 calibrated from the experiments , we find that this condition is not always fulfilled and that the ftl model can be ustable . after the development of the instability , it is observed that the solution does not fit with the observed trajectories . in particular , we observe particle crossings that are forbidden in the experiments .",
    "therefore , in order to be usable , the ftl model has to be stabilized .    here",
    ", the stabilization consists in adding a relaxation term which describes the relaxation of the subject s velocity to an averaged velocity over a certain number of neighbors .",
    "it is intended to model the fact that a given pedestrian may perceive other subjects than just his leader and take them into account in the decision - making process . since it is not precisely known how the informations on the various neighbors are combined , the choice of a relaxation model , being the simplest possible one , is the most reasonable .",
    "additionally , by tuning how the average velocity is computed , it allows some flexibility and calibration by comparisons with the data .",
    "therefore , the considered relaxed form of the ftl model is as follows , for @xmath54 : @xmath55 where the most general form of the weighted average velocity @xmath56 is @xmath57 for positive @xmath58 such that @xmath59 . the quantity @xmath60 $ ] gives the balance between the follow - the - leader term and the relaxation term . when @xmath61 , @xmath62 is independent of @xmath38 and corresponds to the global average velocity .",
    "when @xmath58 is more strongly peaked about @xmath63 , the average velocity becomes more local . in ( [ eq : generalode ] ) ,",
    "we have chosen to write @xmath64 as a convex combination of the two terms ( respectively corresponding to the relaxation towards the leader s velocity and towards the neighbors average velocity ) rather than writing them as a sum .",
    "the reason for this is that the leader also appears in the neighbors average velocity and that the actual measured reaction rate @xmath42 should be distributed among these two terms .",
    "it is also the choice which provides the best fit with the experimental data as we will see below .",
    "the model is equivalent to the model @xmath65 where the average relaxation speed @xmath66 is defined by @xmath67 and is associated with averaging coefficients @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath71 are positive and sum up to 1 . in other words",
    ", one can restrict to the case @xmath72 for the analysis .",
    "however the parameter @xmath73 provides a tuning between the ftl model and the relaxation - to - the - mean model , and the interpretation of this parameter is intuitive .",
    "we thus propose an analysis depending on @xmath73 ( and the parameters @xmath58 will remain fixed ) .",
    "[ rem : relaxation ]    we now perform a stability analysis of model ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) , ( [ eq : generalode ] ) . in the most general",
    "setting considered in the present paper , the constants @xmath42 and @xmath41 depend on the local density , i.e. @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 is computed by enumerating the number of agents in a neigborhood of @xmath77 . in this case ,",
    "( [ eq:1.1 ] ) , ( [ eq : generalode ] ) are coupled , since @xmath76 depends on the values of @xmath78 for all @xmath79 . furthermore",
    ", this coupling makes the problem nonlinear . in the special case where @xmath42 and @xmath41 are constants",
    ", this coupling disappears . indeed , eq . ( [ eq : generalode ] )",
    "can be solved for @xmath30 , @xmath80 without knowing the values of @xmath78 . once the functions @xmath30 are determined , eq .",
    "( [ eq:1.1 ] ) can be integrated and the values of the functions @xmath81 , determined .",
    "additionally , the delay differential equation ( [ eq : generalode ] ) becomes linear .",
    "this will be the case considered in the stability analysis performed in the section below .",
    "we write the model in vector form : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the vector @xmath84 and the exponent @xmath85 denotes the transpose of a vector or a matrix .",
    "the matrix @xmath86 is such that the vector @xmath87 has entries @xmath88 given by @xmath89 concerning this matrix , we have the following    [ prop : eigenvalues ] all the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath86 have a non - positive real part .",
    "more precisely , 0 is an eigenvalue , and all the other eigenvalues have a negative real part .",
    "the non zero eigenvalues lie in the closed disk of center -1 and radius 1 .",
    "* @xmath86 is a circulant matrix . if we denote by @xmath90 the matrix of entries @xmath91 such that @xmath92 if @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 otherwise , we can write : @xmath96 now , we introduce @xmath97 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath90 are @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "hence the eigenvalues of @xmath86 , which will be denoted by @xmath100 are given by : @xmath101 therefore if @xmath102 then @xmath103 . let us now consider the case @xmath104 .",

    "then , since @xmath100 is a convex combination of all these terms , it has a non - positive real part .",

    "therefore , by convexity , @xmath100 also belongs to the disk of center -1 and radius 1 .",

    "we now briefly present comparisons between experimental data and simulations of models ( pm1 ) and ( pm3 ) ( we discard model ( pm2 ) on the basis of the poor matches it provided to the previous experiment ) in two other experiments .",

    "here model ( pm1 ) provides a better match than model ( pm3 ) .",
    "model ( pm3 ) exhibits an excessive damping of the jams , with jams disappearing after @xmath246 s of time .",
    "by contrast , jams are maintained with model ( pm1 ) but they seem to travel more quickly than in the experimental data .",
    "this is correlated with the observation that the pedestrians seem also to travel faster than in the experiment . in the experiment",
    ", pedestrians seem to slow down after a time of about @xmath249-@xmath250  s. this could explain the observed discrepancy with the numerical simulation since the initialization of the delay differential system is set by using the data over the first interval of @xmath249 s duration .",
    "this change of pace of the pedestrians could be due to the transition from a compact group to an equally spaced group .",
    "this tends to indicate that the model is not precise enough for the very large densities that prevail in the compact group .",
    "it is not very surprising since very few experimental data were available in that density range , and so , the calibration does simply not take it into account .    the final experiment , called experiment ( c ) is a small density experiment , with @xmath211 pedestrians walking along the outer circle with an average walking radius of @xmath251 m and initially arranged in an equidistant manner . fig .",
    "[ fig : exp51 ] provides the positions of the pedestrians ( in radians , on the circle ) as functions of time ( in s ) .",
    "experimental data are shown in the left figure , while models ( pm1 ) and ( pm3 ) are shown in the middle and right figures respectively .",
    "parameter @xmath73 was set to @xmath241 in both ( pm1 ) and ( pm3 ) . here , the density is too low and no jam forms , so we can not use jams to assess the quality of the model .",
    "but we easily notice that simulations provide too fast pedestrian velocities compared to the experiments .",
    "also , some clustering of the pedestrians emerges ( though not affecting their velocity and thus , not qualifying as jams according to our previous definition ) .",
    "indeed , there are essentially four clusters at the end of the experiments , with respectively @xmath7 , @xmath1 , @xmath252 , and @xmath1 pedestrians separated by bigger gaps .",
    "this clustering is midly reproduced in the two models ( a little bit more accurately by model ( pm3 ) ) but does not look as sharp as in the experiments . therefore ,",
    "different observables than those defined above should be set up for assessing the validity of the models in the low density case .",
    "the present study of pedestrians walking in line has demonstrated the existence of a significant time - delay , i.e. that the acceleration of a pedestrian at a given time is determined by the relative position and velocity of this pedestrian with respect to his predecessor at an earlier time .",
    "this time delay is about @xmath215 s. given that finding , we have developed three different time - delayed follow - the - leader models .",
    "the first model ( pm3 ) considers that both the time delay @xmath41 and the reaction constant @xmath42 ( i.e. the acceleration intensity ) are constant .",
    "the second model ( pm2 ) considers that @xmath41 and @xmath42 are power laws of the local density . finally , the third model ( pm1 ) supposes that there are two density regimes and that the power law dependences of @xmath41 and @xmath42 are different at low and high local densities , with a larger power at small density than at large density .    in all cases , the models needed to be stabilized by the addition of a relaxation of each pedestrian s velocity to the average velocity of a certain number of his predecessors . in our simulation ,",
    "the number of predecessors was equal to @xmath253 % of the total number of pedestrians involved in the experiment and about @xmath254 % of the reaction of a given pedestrian was triggered by this relaxation and @xmath246 % by the leader following behavior itself .",
    "our finding is that the model that matches the experimental results with the highest degree of accuracy is model ( pm1 ) , i.e. the model where the power law dependences of @xmath41 and @xmath42 are different at low and high local densities .",
    "this model was carefully assessed by investigating the ability of the simulation to reproduce large - scale dynamical features of the experimental data such as jam formation and dynamics .    according to this model",
    ", the leader - following behavior of the pedestrians is different at low and high local densities .",
    "refering to ( [ eq : pm1 ] ) , we notice that @xmath41 decreases like @xmath255 as long as the density is lower than a crossover value of about @xmath256 ped m@xmath213 and then stays approximately constant .",
    "a possible interpretation of this behavior is that pedestrians become increasingly aware of their leader s behavior when their distance to him decreases .",
    "but once this distance exceeds a certain value , there is no further decay of this time - delay as information processing and decision - making take an incompressible amount of time . in a similar way ,",
    "the reaction constant increases almost linearly with the density at low density but saturates to a constant once the crossover value of the density if reached .",
    "it is instructive to remember that the worst model has been shown to be model ( pm2 ) , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are given by a single power law throughout the whole range of values of the local density . even if , in that case , the decay of @xmath41 and the increase of @xmath42 at small density is less pronounced that in model ( pm1 ) , it seems that keeping the same law above the critical density leads to a significant detoriation of the result .",
    "therefore , it seems essential to take into account the saturation of the time delay and response intensity at large densities .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that model ( pm3 ) which keeps @xmath41 and @xmath42 constant and independent of @xmath220 performs better than ( pm2 ) , as if the request that @xmath41 and @xmath42 should be constant at large density overrid the necessity of making them @xmath220-dependent at low density . to some extent",
    ", the model with constant @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the simplest , and offers a very attractive cost - benefit ratio for large - scale simulations . in @xcite , it has been shown to compare favorably to other models in the literature such as @xcite .    to assess the model , we compared the simulated jam dynamics with the experimentally observed one .",
    "this assessment methodology is restricted to the large average density case . indeed , in the small average density case , no jam is formed . in this case",
    ", different assessment methods need to be developed . during calibration",
    ", we observed that , in the low density case , there were significantly less samples which were compliant with the model than in the large density case .",
    "this seems to indicate that the follow - the - leader model alone is unable to correctly account for the low - density observations .",
    "new theoretical models need to be developped in that case .",
    "this model , either in the form ( pm3 ) , or in the form ( pm1 ) , can be used as a building block for two - dimensional models .",
    "indeed , it can account for the speed adjustments of the pedestrians due to the presence of other pedestrians walking in front of them in the same direction .",
    "it can be complemented by a model describing how the direction of motion is changed to account for the presence of obstacles or other pedestrians moving in the opposite direction , in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "such an approach has been already outlined in @xcite and will be pursued in the future .",
    "the pre - processing of the experimental data depends on several parameters , namely the cutoff frequency @xmath257 , the window width @xmath258 , the model parameter @xmath43 and the correlation threshold @xmath192 below which a sample ( pedestrian , time window ) is discarded .",
    "we study the influence of each of these parameters on the retrieved time delay @xmath41 and constant @xmath42 .",
    "the data are gathered by local density and the influence of each parameter is studied by letting the other ones fixed .      to test the effect of the parameter @xmath257 , we process the data of all experiments with the following values : @xmath193 , @xmath259 s , @xmath50 . the cutoff frequency @xmath257 is given the following values @xmath260 hz . the medians of the estimated values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 over the set of samples consisting of ( pedestrian , time window ) pairs ranging through the whole set of experiments are presented in fig .

    "[ fig:35 ] , we notice that as @xmath257 increases , the median of @xmath41 decreases while the median of @xmath42 increases .",
    "the medians of @xmath41 and @xmath42 are only slightly influenced by @xmath257 when @xmath261 hz and in this range of cut - off frequencies , the dependence of these medians with respect to the local density @xmath220 is mild .",
    "by contrast , the medians of @xmath41 and @xmath42 depend much more strongly on @xmath257 for @xmath262 hz and their dependence on the local density if stiffer .",
    "we have also noticed ( not illustrated by a figure ) that the percentage of compliant data increases as @xmath257 decreases until reaching the value @xmath263 hz . in this last case ,",
    "the time - delay found from the calibration is too large for the interval in which it is searched for and the percentage of compliant data then drops dramatically .",
