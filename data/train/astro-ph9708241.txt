    "the cosmic microwave background is remarkably uniform , but redshift surveys of the local galaxy distribution reveal coherent structures that extend over 100 @xmath2mpc  or more ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "one would like to trace the growth of this structure from the very early epoch probed by the microwave background through to the present day .",
    "this objective has motivated clustering studies of homogeneous quasar samples , an approach pioneered by osmer ( 1981 ) . in this paper",
    ", we analyze the clustering of 56 ( of 90 ) high - redshift quasars ( @xmath9 ) from the palomar transit grism survey ( ptgs)(schneider , schmidt , and gunn 1994 , hereafter ssg ) , characterizing structure in a sample that contains some of the most distant quasars discovered to date .",
    "when osmer ( 1981 ) first obtained a survey of 174 quasars ( @xmath10 ) , he was faced with the problem of how to quantify clustering , which he defined as density enhancements significantly in excess of expected random fluctuations . after considering many statistical methods , he adapted and applied binning analysis , the nearest neighbor test , and the correlation function to his sample .",
    "these tests dismissed several close groups picked out by eye as insignificant , and osmer claimed no clustering on the 1003000 @xmath2mpc  scale , which was later confirmed by webster ( 1982 ) using fourier power spectrum analysis .",
    "concerned that the lack of clustering evidence was an observational result of previous small sample sizes , shaver ( 1984 ) devised a method of detecting clustering by comparing quasars close both in redshift and position to those with large differences in either redshift or position .",
    "this method allows for the analysis of inhomogeneous quasar samples , since selection effects cancel out .",
    "he applied his method to the @xmath11 quasars in the vron catalog ( vron - cetty & vron 1984 ) , revealing possible clustering similar to that of galaxies of the current epoch , which was later confirmed and quantified by kruszewski ( 1988 ) , who detected statistically significant clustering on scales up to 32 @xmath2mpc  at low redshift but none at @xmath12 .",
    "later studies of quasar clustering attempted to achieve large sample sizes , while still maintaining homogeneity to minimize selection effects .",
    "shanks et al .",
    "( 1987 ) used 170 quasars from uk schmidt plates , complete to @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and detected clustering on small scales ( @xmath15 @xmath2mpc ) but not on large scales ( @xmath16 @xmath2mpc ) .",
    "drinkwater ( 1988 ) found no clustering on scales of 20200 @xmath2mpc  in a sample of 862 quasars ( @xmath17 ) from six ukst low dispersion objective prism plates .",
    "crampton , cowley & hartwick ( 1989 ) discovered an unusually large group of 23 quasars at @xmath18 , but no statistical evidence for clustering in the remaining 91% of the canada - france - hawaii telescope grens survey .",
    "such large quasar groups ( lqgs ) have been studied by komberg et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who detected 12 lqgs with redshifts @xmath19 , and sizes from @xmath20 to @xmath21 @xmath2mpc .",
    "recently shanks and boyle ( 1994 ) have examined the clustering in three combined surveys with a total of 690 qsos at @xmath22 , claiming a @xmath23 detection with a best value of @xmath24(r@xmath25 @xmath2mpc)=@xmath26 for the mean 2-point correlation function of pairs with comoving separation r@xmath25 @xmath2mpc  ( @xmath27=0.5 ) .",
    "kundic ( 1997 ) has also evaluated the clustering properties of 232 quasars from the ptgs and found significant clustering on scales less than 40 @xmath2mpc .",
    "this study will concentrate on the high - redshift quasars ( @xmath28 from the ptgs .",
    "the extreme distance of these quasars allows analysis of the universe when it was only about ten percent of its current age , providing the earliest observational link between the homogeneity of the universe at recombination , and the clumpiness of today s environs . if quasar clustering is indicative of the large - scale distribution of their parent galaxy groups , quantifying clustering of these very `` young '' objects could help discriminate between various models of structure formation",
    "the ptgs was carried out with the hale telescope , using the 4-shooter camera / spectrograph ( gunn et al . 1987 ) in time delay - and - integrate ( tdi ) mode in order to obtain large numbers of low - resolution slitless spectra .",
    "the total effective area of the survey is 61.47 square degrees , which is covered in six narrow strips @xmath29 wide .",
    "a computer algorithm was used to search the @xmath30600,000 grism spectra for the presence of emission lines .",
    "the primary target was the lyman @xmath31 line , which appears in the survey bandpass at redshifts between 2.7 and 4.8 .",
    "a total of 928 emission - line objects were found .",
    "approximately 70% of the objects were low - redshift emission - line galaxies ; 90 of the sources were quasars at redshifts between  2.757 and  4.733 .",
    "this study of high redshift quasar clustering concentrates on two strips of the survey .",
    "the `` mn '' strip spans right ascensions from @xmath32 to @xmath33 ( with a @xmath34 break caused by clouds ) , at a central declination of @xmath35 , covering 9.98 square degrees and containing 24 quasars with @xmath0 .",
    "the `` qr '' strip spans right ascensions from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , at a central declination of @xmath38 , covering 11.91 square degrees , with 32 @xmath0 quasars .",
    "these two strips were selected for analysis because they have the faintest effective flux limits for quasar detection ( this limit is determined by a combination of seeing , exposure time , sky brightness , and throughput of instrument ; see ssg ) . while they cover but a third of the survey area , they contain nearly two thirds of the high redshift survey quasars ( 56 out of 90 ) .",
    "the remaining strips are too sparse to yield statistically significant results ( positive or negative ) in our tests , though we include them in our calculation of the correlation length in section 4.6 below .",
    "to determine absolute distances between quasar pairs , the quasar s equatorial coordinates are converted to rectangular comoving coordinates using the quasar s redshift as a measure of its distance    @xmath39    assuming that @xmath40 .    to investigate quasar clustering in this sample , the observed sample is compared with a large number of randomly populated monte carlo generated samples which match the actual sample in sky coordinates and redshift distribution .",
    "the right ascension coordinate is chosen randomly between the upper and lower strip limits , except in the mn simulation .",
    "while obtaining the direct imaging data for the mn strip , the passage of a moderately thick cloud through the field rendered the data between right ascensions @xmath41 and @xmath42 unusable ( see ssg ) .",
    "if the simulation created a quasar with a position in this region , the quasar was deleted and a new one selected to take its place .",
    "the declination coordinate is selected through a fractional areas technique which equates a random number to the fraction of the area below a declination , yielding a random declination given by    @xmath43,\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 is a randomly chosen number between zero and one , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the declination limits of the test strips .",
    "redshifts are chosen randomly from a smooth model of the observed redshift distribution ( figure 1 ) .",
    "all random numbers are generated by the subroutine ran2 obtained from _ numerical recipes _",
    "( press et al .",
    "1992 ) , which was tested and found to be sufficiently random over the required number of calls .",
    "these methods are used for each quasar in each trial , where the number of quasars randomly generated in each strip matches the observed number : 24 in the mn strip , and 32 in the qr strip . each strip",
    "is numerically modeled @xmath1 times for the following statistical analyses .",
    "the first comparison is between the observed and average random distributions of separations between quasar pairs .",
    "the distance is found between all possible quasars pairs in the volume , and these distances are placed into 25 logarithmic bins , where the bins are created to span nearly the entire range of observed separations , from 10 @xmath2mpc  to approximately 8000 @xmath2mpc .",
    "the average random pair separation distribution is found by adding each pair separation to the appropriate distance bin as each trial is executed , yielding the cumulative number of pairs in each bin from the entire @xmath1 trials , which is then normalized by dividing by the number of trials .",
    "the observed and average random quasar pair separation distributions are plotted for each of the two strips in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "these plots show that for separations greater than @xmath47 @xmath2mpc , the observed distribution of pair separations is very nearly random , while at separations @xmath48 @xmath2mpc , quasar pairs exist where none should if the distribution were random .",
    "the apparent deficit of observed pairs in the 20 - 100 @xmath2mpc  bins of the qr strip is not statistically significant , as only 2.24 pairs are expected .",
    "by contrast , the single pair in the smallest bin for this strip is quite significant ; only 2.7% of monte carlo trials have one or more pairs in this bin .",
    "the two pairs with @xmath49 @xmath2mpc  in the mn strip are much more significant still ; only 0.523% of the @xmath1 monte carlo trials have two or more pairs in the first four bins .      in order to determine if these excess quasar pairs are due to selection effects , the coordinates and redshifts of each of the observed quasars in the survey are scrambled and randomly redistributed @xmath1 times , so that all coordinates are assigned to all redshifts in random combinations .",
    "the resulting average scrambled pair separation distribution for each strip is also shown in figures 2 & 3 .    for the mn strip ,",
    "the scrambled pair separation distribution very nearly matches the observed distribution on scales larger than @xmath47 @xmath2mpc , but scrambling does not produce significant numbers of close quasar pairs like the ones observed .",
    "similarly in the qr strip , the scrambled distribution is close to the observed distribution , except for in the smallest bin , where again , no significant number of close quasar pairs are evidenced like the one observed .",
    "these results are nearly identical to the monte carlo generated results at the clustering scale under investigation , and show that the observed quasar pairs are _ not _ due to selection effects .      for another test",
    ", one can ask how the minimum quasar pair separation in each of the randomly generated strips compares with the observed minimum quasar pair separation .",
    "this is answered by figure 4 , which shows the cumulative probability distribution for any minimum separation in each quasar strip .",
    "this distribution is obtained by determining the distance between the closest quasar pair in each of the @xmath1 trials , placing them cumulatively into the standard logarithmic bins , and normalizing to one by dividing by @xmath1 . superimposed onto their respective curves",
    "are filled circles representing the closest observed quasar pairs for each strip , and the third quasar pair ( with a separation of 24.13 @xmath2mpc ) for reference .",
    "this plot shows that the probability of obtaining _ one _ minimum separation as small as that exhibited in any of these three pairs is less than 10% .",
    "a nearest neighbor distance ( the distance to the closest quasar ) is calculated for each quasar in the survey , and these distances are placed into the same logarithmic bins . for the randomly generated quasars ,",
    "the nearest neighbor distance is calculated for each quasar in each trial , placed into bins , and the bins are averaged over the @xmath1 trials , yielding the mean number of quasar pairs in each bin .",
    "this is compared to the observed number of nearest neighbor pairs in each bin in figures 5 & 6 for the mn and qr strips . from these plots",
    "it is evident that for the mn strip , the nearest neighbor separation distribution peaks at @xmath50 @xmath2mpc , both for the randomly generated quasars and the observed quasars , _ but _ the observed nearest neighbor distribution is dramatically higher at very small separations ( @xmath48 @xmath2mpc ) , where the two quasar pairs lie ( the plot registers two in each bin because a nearest neighbor distance was measured for _ each _ quasar , hence a single close pair will produce two identical nearest neighbor distances ) .",
    "both the observed and the random distributions for the qr strip also peaks near @xmath50 @xmath2mpc , but here again the observed distribution is elevated at the smallest distance bin , corresponding to the single pair in the qr strip .",

    "the probability corresponding to the observed number of quasar pairs in each bin is highlighted , revealing that the first and fourth bins of the mn strip , and the first bin in the qr strip are virtually the only bins which do _ not conform to the predicted most probable number of pairs per bin .",

    "the pair counts at large separations are consistent with poisson fluctuations in an unclustered distribution , but the high estimates of @xmath65 at @xmath49 @xmath2mpc  are clearly inconsistent with a random quasar distribution .    because the quasar distribution is sparse , the probability of obtaining @xmath66 pairs when",

    "because our sample is so small we will assume that the true quasar correlation function has the same _ form _ as the present - day galaxy correlation function    @xmath68    and estimate only the correlation length @xmath4 itself .",
