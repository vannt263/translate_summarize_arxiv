    "it is well known that the laser plasma emits photons with frequencies which are different from the frequency of the incident laser beam . for a number of applications an emission of high energy photons",
    "is the most interesting phenomenon .",
    "the known mechanisms which can be responsible for the high energy photo - production could be identified as the following three ones : the high harmonic generation , laser stimulated bremsstrahlung and laser assisted recombination .",
    "these processes differ by the initial and final states of the active electron . in the harmonic generation",
    "the initial state electron occupies a ( laser - dressed ) atomic bound state , usually it is the ground atomic state . in the final state of this reaction",
    "the electron can occupy either the same bound state , or some excited or even ionized state .",
    "the laser stimulated bremsstrahlung is a free - free transition during which the electron is scattered by an atom in the laser field . during the scattering",
    "the electron emits a high - energy quantum . in the laser assisted recombination ( lar )",
    "the electron starts in the laser - dressed continuum , but ends up in the bound state .",
    "the process of harmonic generation is currently studied very actively with important advancements both in theory and experiment ( for reviews see refs .",
    "the laser stimulated bremsstrahlung plays the very important role in plasma physics , see recent experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite works .",
    "the subject of the present study is the lar process . as far as we know",
    ", it has not yet received a proper attention in the literature , although its importance for kinetics of laser plasma and its emission spectrum was indicated before @xcite . from the point of view of the high - energy photo - production",
    "the lar possesses an advantage over the stimulated bremsstrahlung because in lar the electron impact energy is totally transferred to the high energy quanta .    the conventional ( laser - field free )",
    "radiative recombination of the continuum electron to the bound state is a well studied process which is inverse to the photoionization .",
    "the frequency of the emitted photon is uniquely defined by the energy conservation law .",
    "when a similar process occurs in the presence of an intensive laser field the radiation spectrum becomes much more richer since the recombination may be accompanied by absorption or emission of laser quanta . therefore the emitted photon spectrum represents a sequence of equidistant lines separated by the laser frequency @xmath0 .",
    "the recent review by hahn @xcite on the electron recombination mentions only one , very special version of lar process , namely _",
    "one  photon _ lar when the laser is tuned in resonance with the energy of free - bound electron transition , and only emission of photons with this particular energy is considered .",
    "the study of this special case was initiated quite long ago @xcite and remains active in connection with the processes in the storage rings @xcite , formation of positronium @xcite and antihydrogen @xcite and even with possible cosmological manifestations @xcite . in all these theoretical studies",
    "the laser field was presumed to be weak and its influence on an initial and/or final electron states was neglected , except refs .",
    "@xcite which are commented below .    for production of high - energy photons",
    "it is very interesting to extend the mentioned above studies allowing for the multiphoton absorption during lar .",
    "obviously the multiphoton processes can happen with high probability only in a strong laser field .",
    "from this point of view there arises a necessary to fulfill a systematic study of lar in a strong laser field in multiphoton regime .",
    "this paper makes a first step in this direction .    an additional , and rather unexpected inspiration for",
    "the present study arises from the fact that lar comprises one of the steps in the three - step quantum scheme of high harmonic generation .",
    "this scheme has recently been firmly established , see ref.@xcite and bibliography therein .",
    "the major statement of @xcite is that the high harmonic generation can be described as the multiphoton ionization of an atomic electron which is followed by the lar of this electron with the parent atomic particle . from this point of view",
    "the lar plays a role of a part of the problem of the high harmonic generation , which is important not only for the dense laser plasma , but also for photo - production from individual atoms in strong laser fields , where the harmonic generation is the major source for high energy photons .",
    "the present study is devoted mostly to the patterns of intensities in the emitted photon spectrum depending on the laser field strength .",
    "we comment also on the influence of laser field on the total recombination cross section . here , as well as in other applications , the laser field is intensive and lar proceeds in substantially _",
    "multiphoton _ regime .",
    "consider an electron in the laser - dressed continuum state @xmath1 with the translational momentum @xmath2 .",
    "its recombination to the bound state generally results in the emission of photons with the frequencies @xmath3 defined from @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the quasienergy of the field - dressed bound state @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the amplitude of the electric field strength in the laser wave , @xmath8 is the electron quiver energy in the laser field , @xmath9 is an integer .",
    "hereafter we use atomic system of units unless stated otherwise . in the zero - laser - field limit ( @xmath10 ) only emission of the photon with the frequency @xmath11 is allowed with @xmath12 being the bound state energy .",
    "the presence of an intensive laser field makes possible multiphoton processes when laser quanta are absorbed from the field or transmitted to it , with the amplitude @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the laser field period , and in the dipole momentum operator @xmath15 the unit vector @xmath16 selects polarization of emitted radiation .",
    "the lar cross section is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the velocity of light .",
    "the cross section ( [ cr ] ) refers to the process of _ spontaneous _ lar , since it is presumed that _ incident _ electromagnetic field with the frequency @xmath3 is absent . in case if such a probe field is present , generally it would be amplified in course of propagation through the medium containing free electrons .",
    "there is a number of theoretical works devoted to calculation of related gain in case of one - photon lar .",
    "a recent paper by zaretskii and nersesov @xcite explores the amplification in case of multiphoton lar .",
    "generally these studies imply some assumptions regarding the medium properties and result in the expressions for the rate of stimulated transitions via that of spontaneous transitions and some characteristics of laser beam and the experimental arrangement @xcite .",
    "the present paper provides analysis of spontaneous lar whereas issues of radiation amplification are beyond its scope .",

    "the transition between two regimes could be described by the airy function .",

    "in particular , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the results shown by squares in fig .  [ fig2 ] are obtained using the plain semiclassical formula ( [ csp ] ) with two or one saddle points included as discussed above ; the deviations from the numerical results are seen to be essential only in a very narrow transitions region .",
    "since the numerical evaluation of integral ( [ cf ] ) over time is not difficult , we employ the adiabatic approach in order to obtain better insight into the pattern of emitted radiation spectrum , but not for producing an alternative method to evaluate the amplitudes .      in this case",
    "the real - valued result for @xmath68 is provided by both upper and lower sign in the expression ( [ sprad ] ) .",

    "the first of them , with one pair of real - valued saddle points @xmath68 , corresponds to @xmath84 lying in the interval ( [ cond1 ] ) . at smaller photon frequencies ,",
    "another subdomain is defined by the condition @xmath119 here _ two pairs _ of real saddle points @xmath68 exist .",
    "the spectrum for this situation is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( @xmath120 ev , @xmath112 w/@xmath103 , @xmath121 , @xmath115 ) .",
    "the classically allowed domain lies in the interval @xmath122 , with the four - saddle - point regime being operative for @xmath123 , and the two - saddle point regime for @xmath124 .",
    "the results of numerical calculations shown by circles suggest that the oscillations in @xmath118 or @xmath125 proceed with two different frequencies , the higher frequency being characteristic for the four - saddle - point domain . the plain semiclassical formula",
    "( [ csp ] ) ( squares ) essentially reproduces this structure . of course",
    ", it is not designed for accurate description of a transition between the two - saddle - point and four - saddle - point regimes where the deviations are seen to be larger . a special",
    ", more sophisticated treatment is required here , but such complications are not pursued in the present study as argued above .",
    "the non - standard situation emerges also at the left edge of the classically allowed interval where all saddle points simultaneously move from the real axis into the complex @xmath61 plane .",
    "this transition region could not be described by a simple airy - type pattern that is known to give a monotonous decrease in the classically forbidden domain ; on the contrary , the numerical results reveal some structure in this region , see fig . [ fig3 ] . bearing all this in mind",
    "it is not unexpected that the plain semiclassical approximation ( [ csp ] ) essentially fails near the left border of the classically allowed domain .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention also another region where the standard semiclassical approximation fails .",
    "namely , for @xmath126 the saddle point positions coincide with the poles of the function @xmath127 .",
    "the situation when an exact coincidence occurs is tractable rather easily @xcite .",
    "somewhat more effort is required to obtain uniform description of a transition between this case and a situation when the saddle point and the pole are well separated , as presumed in simple formula ( [ csp ] ) .",
    "again , such sophistication are beyond the scope of the present study .    at last ,",
    "[ fig4 ] shows a transient situation between the fast and slow electron regimes ( @xmath128 ev , @xmath112 w/@xmath103 , @xmath129 , @xmath115 ) .",
    "here only two harmonics ( @xmath130 ) correspond to the four - saddle - point regime .",
    "the remaining part of the classically - allowed domain , @xmath131 corresponds to two - saddle - point regime .",
    "most of the spectrum is well described by the plain saddle - point approximation ( [ csp ] ) and covered by the envelope function ( [ env ] ) , albeit the highest peak at @xmath132 exceeds it , as being in the region of the transition between the two and four - saddle point regimes .",
    "quite paradoxically , the low - frequency classically forbidden region with well manifested structure exhibits much higher emission intensities as compared with the large - frequency edge of the classically allowed domain .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the lar is one of the processes responsible for emission of high energy photons by the laser plasma .",
    "surprisingly , it has not yet received attention of researchers .",
    "this is particularly unsatisfactory since the other processes leading to high energy photons ( harmonic generation and laser stimulated bremsstrahlung ) are currently under active scrutiny .",
    "the present paper could be considered as a first step to start filling this gap .",
    "the theory in many aspects is parallel to the treatment of multiphoton ionization ( mpi ) where the keldysh approximation is known to provide an important insight and quantitatively reliable results .",
    "the origin of differences between mpi and lar lies in the kinematics : in mpi process the allowed electron energy in the continuum are robustly defined by the parameters of the system ( initial electron binding energy , laser field frequency and strength ) , whereas in the lar the continuum electron energy is arbitrary .",
    "this rather trivial observation results in important consequences of physical character .",
    "they are particularly lucid in the adiabatic regime when laser frequency is sufficiently small .",
    "the ionization is a _ tunneling _",
    "process for all above - threshold channels . on the contrary , in the lar",
    "there is a domain of photon frequencies for which emission is allowed _",
    "classically_.    the keldysh - type approximation allowed us to describe evolution of the lar spectrum as the laser field varies , from the single line with only weak satellites in the low - field limit to the broad pattern of equidistantly spaced harmonics in the strong field case . in the adiabatic approximation ( i.e. the saddle point method ) the photon spectrum is subdivided into classically allowed and classically forbidden domains , with the line intensities being highest at the boundaries of the former region . concerning the quantitative side of the problem ,",
    "the adiabatic approach is less efficient for the lar process as compared with the treatment of above threshold ionization ( ati ) .",
    "the reason is that in the latter case the saddle point method is well applicable in its most simple form , whereas for lar process some technical complications emerge .",
    "the difference stems from the fact that ati process always effectively occurs at complex - valued moments of time , whereas for lar this is generally not the case , and several regimes could be operative with the transition regions between them . albeit not drastic , these complications to our opinion",
    "hardly warrant necessary cumbersome analytical involvements , bearing in mind that the numerical calculations are quite simple and straightforward .",
    "nevertheless the saddle point method remains very useful for understanding the intensity patterns in the emitted photon spectrum .",
    "an additional assumption of the present study , that in principle could be easily abandoned , is the use of asymptotic expression ( [ wf ] ) for the final bound state wave function .",
    "again , in the lar process the situation is less favorable for this approximation as compared with the ati process .",
    "this is because , as discussed in detail earlier @xcite , the long - range asymptote of the bound state wave function governs ati amplitudes , whereas lar process is more sensitive to the wave function behavior in the entire coordinate space .    as is pictured by fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the amount of noticeable lines in the photon spectrum increases with the laser field strength , but the intensity of each individual line decreases in average .",
    "the cross section of the electron transition into the bound state summed over all emitted photon channels is @xmath133 .",
    "it exhibits only very weak dependence on the laser filed intensity @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the particular case of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we obtain for @xmath134 the values @xmath135 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 for the laser field intensities @xmath102 w/@xmath103 .",
    "recent calculations @xcite of the laser - assisted antihydrogen formation in positron - antiproton collisions employed coulomb - volkov wave function for the initial electron continuum state @xmath19 and the laser - perturbed wave function for the bound state .",
    "the authors considered only one - photon lar process and concluded that the lar cross section decreases for the stronger laser fields .",
    "the present results indicate that if the multiphoton processes are included , then the total lar cross section is essentially independent on laser field intensity .",
    "thus the effect of a laser on the recombination process looks very straightforward .",
