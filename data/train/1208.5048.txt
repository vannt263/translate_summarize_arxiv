    "the study of systems with long range memory reveals some physical phenomena that are still not well understood , especially in systems which are outside the state of equilibrium or those in which the existence of anomalous diffusion is verified  @xcite .",
    "here we show a simple analytical method which describes the behavior of the diffusion for large and intermediate times . in order to do that",
    ", we first generalize the concept of the diffusion exponent",
    ". then we present a conjecture to obtain , through the introduction of a time scaling factor @xmath0 , an analytical asymptotic result for the diffusion coefficient for long times .",
    "we obtain the scaling factor exactly and we show as well its universal behavior . we derive a numerical method to obtain the correlation function of velocities for an ensemble of particles from any given memory . we compare both methods and we obtain excellent agreement .",
    "the method has general application in the study of stochastic processes and it could be applied to several situations of physical interest .",
    "the generalized langevin equation ( gle ) is a stochastic differential equation which can be used to model systems driven by colored random forces . for the velocity operator @xmath1",
    "this equation can be written as , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the retarded friction kernel of the system , or the memory function . here",
    ", @xmath4 is a stochastic noise subject to the conditions @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the correlation function for @xmath4 , and the angular brackets denote an average over the ensemble of particles .",
    "equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) is kubo s fluctuation dissipation theorem ( fdt )  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the kernel @xmath3 allows us to study a large number of correlated processes . in the real world , the vast majority of problems are non - markovian , i.e. , there is correlation between the various stages of dynamic evolution .",
    "this property is what we call memory , and it makes remote events of the past important to dynamic events in the present time .    using the gle it is possible to study the asymptotic behavior of the second moment of the particle movement , @xmath9@xmath10 which characterizes the type of diffusion presented by the system . here",
    ", @xmath11 is the diffusion coefficient as a function of time .",
    "moreover , for an asymptotic behavior of the form @xmath12 ^ { \\pm 1 } } , \\label{x2g}\\ ] ] we shall define respectively an @xmath13 diffusive behavior . here",
    "the exponent @xmath14 arises in analogy with the critical exponents in a phase transition .",
    "for example , in the two - dimensional ising model the critical exponent for the specific heat is @xmath15 because it does not have a power law behavior ; rather it has @xmath16 behavior for temperatures @xmath17 close to the transition temperature @xmath18 .",
    "this generalized nomenclature is pertinent here since there are quite a large number of possibilities of combinations for logarithmic and power law behaviors .    in this way",
    "the behavior of @xmath11 can be determined using @xmath19 where @xmath20 , with @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the laplace transform of @xmath23 . for @xmath24 and normal diffusion",
    "this is the kubo formula @xcite .",
    "the limits can be justified using the final value theorem ( fvt ) for a laplace transform @xcite , i.e. , for any function @xmath25 with laplace transform @xmath26 then @xmath27 .",
    "now a laplace transform of the integral gives @xmath28 , and we end up with the equation above .",
    "now we multiply eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) by @xmath29 and take the average over the ensemble , with @xmath6 , to obtain a self - consistent equation for @xmath23 in the form @xmath30 we then laplace transform eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) to get @xmath31    time correlation functions play a central role in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics in many areas , such as the dynamics of polymeric chains  @xcite , metallic liquids  @xcite , lennard - jones liquids  @xcite , ratchet devices  @xcite , spin waves @xcite , heisenberg ferromagnets and dense fluids @xcite .",
    "consequently to invert this transform , or a similar one , is crucial . unfortunately , in most cases it is not an easy task . in those situations ,",
    "the use of numerical methods is an alternative to overcome this problem .",
    "our main objective here is to show a process to obtain the asymptotic behavior analytically .",
    "although the method can be applied to several situations , we concentrate here on the analysis of diffusion .",

    "we need more information about @xmath45 , which may be different for every system .",

    "( [ x2 g ] ) . for @xmath52",
    "this gives a diffusion with exponent @xmath53 ; for @xmath54 this gives an @xmath55 , and for @xmath56 and @xmath57 we get an @xmath58 diffusion .",
    "if @xmath45 has another contribution , besides @xmath51 , that can not be expanded at the origin we keep it and expand the other parts .",

    "in our conjecture some points deserve attention : first , we are considering integrals , of the form eq .",

    "@xmath23 is such that it always has a well - defined behavior for finite @xmath66 , even when the integral diverges as @xmath67 , as in superdifusion .",
    "second , @xmath11 must have a leading term as @xmath67 , which determines the diffusion .",
    "for example , the inverse laplace transform of @xmath22 is @xmath68 here the real number @xmath69 is such that all the singularities lie at the left of the line joining the limits .",
    "consider now eq .",
    "( [ gammag ] ) with @xmath70 , and @xmath71 ; then @xmath72 , and @xmath73 where we have done the transformations @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "for @xmath76 the only pole is at @xmath77 , and the condition in @xmath78 will be automatically satisfied . now by direct integration on eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) we obtain @xmath79 . from the scaling we get the equivalent result @xmath80",
    "note that the above exact result is not only for power laws , but for any function behaving as a power law for large @xmath66 .",
    "we confirm as well the relation @xmath81 , obtained by morgado _ et al .",
    "our results can be readily expressed as @xmath82 the factor @xmath0 depends only on the diffusion exponent @xmath53 , consequently it is universal",
    ". moreover it will be the same for @xmath53 or @xmath13 . for normal",
    "diffusion @xmath83 , or for @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "however , we still can obtain the final value . consider as example the langevin equation without memory ; for that we have @xmath86 and @xmath87 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq9b ] ) we get @xmath88 while direct integration gives @xmath89 in this case the scaling yields correctly the wanted final value .",
    "equation ( [ eq6 ] ) imposes as well some requirements on @xmath23 .",
    "first its derivative must be null at the origin , i.e. , the integral in the right hand side must be null at @xmath90 .",
    "this is true except for non analytical memories , such as @xmath91 functions .",
    "indeed , we do not expect exponential behavior of the form @xmath92 with a discontinuous derivative at the origin @xcite .",
    "second , in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , for a bath of harmonic oscillators the noise can be obtained as @xcite @xmath93 d \\omega , \\label{noise}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 are random phases and @xmath95 is the noise spectral density .",
    "the fdt yields @xmath96 this shows that the memory is an even function of @xmath66 .",
    "an analytical extension of @xmath45 in the whole complex plane has the property @xmath97 .",
    "consequently , from eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , @xmath98 , or @xmath99 . in short",

    "even functions have zero derivatives at the origin as required before .",

    "@xmath101 is a dimensionless constant , and @xmath102 is a cutoff frequency .",
    "for @xmath103 we get anomalous diffusion .",
    "in particular , for @xmath104 we introduce eq .",

    "( [ lambda ] ) we obtain @xmath108 , exactly .",

    "now we compare the analytical asymptotic with a numerical solution of eq .",

    "the value of @xmath0 approaches the exact value @xmath126 as the ratio @xmath125 decreases , or as time increases .",
