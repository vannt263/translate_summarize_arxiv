    "<S> the branching ratio of the process @xmath3 , which has already been measured by the cleo collaboration@xcite , is within the sm predictions . unlike the decay @xmath3 , the process @xmath4(@xmath5 or @xmath6 ) is expected to be dominated by long distance contributions through the mechanism of vector meson dominance(vmd)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it was usually believed that the long distance ( resonance ) contributions arise only in some particular region of the invariant mass spectrum of the dilepton pair@xcite , since the involved resonance @xmath7 peak is very sharp . </S>",
    "<S> detailed calculation@xcite shows that there exists significant interference between the short and long distance contributions , which leaves only a small portion of kinematic region at low dilepton invariant mass where the interference effect by the resonances is small . </S>",
    "<S> the energy spectrum of single lepton has also been given in @xcite where a window of nearly pure short distance information is found .    </S>",
    "<S> in the present work , we will re - examine both the dilepton invariant mass and the single lepton energy spectrums using an alternative treatment of the vmd amplitude . in the previous analysis of the cascade </S>",
    "<S> decays @xmath8 and @xmath9 , an effective description is made for the later electromagnetic transition @xmath9@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the vmd amplitude on the square of the dilepton invariant mass , @xmath1 , is approximated by that of the resonance mass @xmath10 or @xmath11 in the denominator of the photon propagator . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation is only valid near the resonance region , and consequently , the previous analysis are not complete in the whole phase space .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start with the short distance contributions to @xmath12 with @xmath5 or @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the short distance contributions come from box , @xmath13 and photon penguin diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> the qcd corrected effective hamiltonian in sm is @xcite : @xmath14,\\label{1}\\ ] ] with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the invariant mass of the dilepton . </S>",

    "<S> the function @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be found in ref.@xcite . here for numerical evaluation , we use @xmath27gev@xcite , @xmath28gev , @xmath29gev , @xmath30mev @xcite .    by normalizing to the semileptonic rate , </S>",

    "<S> if we take the experimental result @xmath36@xcite , the differential decay rate of @xmath37 is found , which is depicted in fig.1 as the dash - dotted line .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there are also long distance resonance contributions from @xmath38 state </S>",
    "<S> . there are six known resonances in the @xmath38 system that can contribute to this decay mode @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest two , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , were considered in the previous analyses@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we also consider the same two resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the higher resonances will also contribute , but they are less important in our case of discussing the uncertainties , as will be shown later .    </S>",
    "<S> applying the vmd mechanism , the long distance contribution is through @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , where the resonance can also be @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> these give the effective lagrangian @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a qcd corrected coefficient of the four quark operators . </S>",
    "<S> below we will use the phenomenological value @xmath45 which comes from fitting the data of @xmath46 meson decays@xcite . note that the expression ( [ 4 ] ) differs from the previous ones@xcite by keeping the photon propagator as @xmath47 instead of @xmath48 or @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> thus it holds in the whole kinematic region .    </S>",
    "<S> the effective coupling of a vector meson @xmath50 is defined by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the polarization vector of the vector meson @xmath53 . on the mass - shell of the vector meson </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath54 is replaced by the decay constant @xmath55 which can be obtained from the leptonic width of the vector meson : @xmath56    the structure of eqn.([4 ] ) is the same as that of the operator @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to include the resonance contribution in eqn.(3 ) by simply making the replacement @xmath58 assuming a constant coupling @xmath59 as done in @xcite , the numerical result is given in fig.1 as the dashed line . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that , this spectrum is enhanced in the low @xmath1 region due to the explicit inclusion of the photon propagator . from fig.1 , we can also expect that higher resonances other than @xmath39 or @xmath40 contribute mainly in the region @xmath60 where we are not interested , since near this tail of the spectrum no useful short distance information is expected to emerge .    </S>",
    "<S> the assumption made above on the constant coupling of @xmath61 can be improved by accounting for the mechanism of terasaki suppression for the @xmath62 conversion@xcite . in the framework of vmd </S>",
    "<S> , the data on photoproduction of @xmath39 indicates a large suppression of @xmath63 compare to @xmath64@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has been confirmed in @xcite by constraining the dominant long distance contribution to @xmath65 using the present upper bound on the @xmath66 decay rate . as a result , it can be concluded that this suppression results in a much smaller long distance contribution to @xmath3 transition@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> now we use a momentum dependent @xmath67 in @xmath68 , which is used in @xcite to obtain a reduced resonance to nonresonance interference where a broader region of invariant mass spectrum sensitive to short distance physics is claimed .    the momentum dependence of @xmath54(@xmath69 ) derived using a dispersion relation@xcite </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath70\\right ) , \\label{8}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 and @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath73 is defined by @xmath74 with @xmath75 for @xmath76 . as a result , eqn.([8 ] ) , which is valid for @xmath76 , is an interpolation of @xmath77 from the photoproduction experimental data on @xmath78 to @xmath79 from the leptonic width based on quark - loop diagram . </S>",
    "<S> we assume @xmath80 for @xmath81 mainly due to the fact that the behavior of the @xmath62 conversion strength is not clear in this region , and is not important in our case ( see below ) .    applying terasaki s formula ( [ 8 ] ) for the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath54 , the differential decay rate of @xmath4 receives suppression in low @xmath1 region . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is still significant interference between the resonance and the short distance contributions , due to the factor @xmath82 coming from the propagator of the virtual photon . </S>",
    "<S> this is also shown in fig.1 .    </S>",
    "<S> now we turn to the energy spectrum of single lepton . </S>",
    "<S> the integration over @xmath1 is complicated , since many functions here involve @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> we simply give the numerical results in fig.2 for @xmath84(see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that , if the @xmath82 behavior is replaced by @xmath85 ( or @xmath86 ) everywhere , there is almost no contribution from the @xmath39 , @xmath40 resonance when @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is what has been arrived in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if , however , this @xmath82 is retained , there are also contributions from the resonances even in the low @xmath88 region and consequently , the resonance background is still serious . including the effect of terasaki suppression of @xmath54 in the low @xmath1 region , the result </S>",
    "<S> is also shown in fig.2 where the resonance background is only half reduced .    from both fig.1 and fig.2 </S>",
    "<S> , we can observe that the long distance vmd contributions to the process @xmath89 are large , if an alternative treatment of the electromagnetic sub - process is performed . </S>",
    "<S> it can also be seen that the single lepton energy spectrum is almost useless in extraction of any short distance information from the resonance background . </S>",
    "<S> the total branching ratio of @xmath4 turn out to be @xmath90 or @xmath91 with the effect of terasaki suppression included or not .    </S>",
    "<S> we have treated the resonance contribution from @xmath39 , @xmath40 to @xmath89 alternatively without using the effective description of the electromagnetic sub - process @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> the long distance contributions are found to be significant , especially in the single lepton energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> concerning other higher resonances , and also other uncertainties existed in this decay mode@xcite , we conclude that it is difficult to extract short distance information , which is sensitive to new physics , from the dominant long distance contributions . </S>"
