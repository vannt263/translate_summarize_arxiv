    "16 ) .     ]     ]    a little bit different situation can be observed in the stabilizing of the cycles of the length 8 . besides the equilibriums of the auxiliary systems that corresponds to the actual cycles of the lengths 8",
    ", one can see a stabilization of the equilibria corresponding to the cycles of the lengths 1,2,4 ( see fig .",
    "it can be concluded from the analysis of the behavior of the graph for the corresponding control ( se fig .",

    "20 ) .",
    "one of the traditional methods of cycle stabilization in non - linear discrete systems is predictive control schedule @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the predictive control was used for stabilization of the cycles of the length from 1 to 6 in the system with sudden occurrence of chaos , abbreviated soc : @xmath584 below we will illustrate the application of the dfg method for the stabilization of 3-cycle ( fig 21,22 ) and 7-cycles ( fig 23 , 24 ) in a system with soc .",
    "let us mention several advantages of the proposed modified dfc method in the article compare to the predictive control .",
    "the system with predictive control in fact is a system with advancing argument . in such systems",
    "it happen very often that cause - effect relations are broken , that can lead to various non - controlling effect .",
    "a system with modified dfc is a system with delay , the control uses not predicted values rather real . moreover , instead of the values of the previous instances of time one needs to know just the dispersion of the values of the function in a prior cycle . as a result",
    ", the rate of the convergence is increasing and the total number of computations is decreasing .",
    "for instance , to stabilize the 7-cycle of the logistic equation the predictive control requires 10000 iterations while mdfc just 700 .",
    "predictive control has limitations on the length of stabilizing cycles , which is caused by the accumulation of the rounding errors of the computational procedures .",
    "mdfc is robust to the parameters of the systems and to the cycle multipliers .",
    "moreover , the rate of robustness can be improved .",
    "let us explain this moment more precisely .",
    "consider the control where the strength coefficients are defined by @xmath556 and @xmath585 are computed by .",
    "this control will stabilize all equilibriums of the system with multipliers from the set which is inverse with respect to the unit circle to the image of the exterior of the unit disc @xmath37 under the polynomial mapping @xmath586 i.e. @xmath587 here @xmath588 is the extended complex plane .",
    "the image of the exterior of the unit disc and the inverse sets are displayed on the fig . [ fig25 ] .    ) ]    the inverse image in the neighborhood of some critical points could be tangent to the negative real axis , which might negatively affect the robust properties of the control if the values of multipliers are close to these critical points .",
    "since the multipliers usually are not known in advance then such situation can not be excluded .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to separate this set from the real line .",
    "it can be done by applying the following procedure which we call @xmath441-trick .",
    "namely , define new coefficients of the control @xmath589 where @xmath590 it is clear that the normalizing conditions @xmath591 is still valid and the control still stabilize the system . in this way the boundary of the region of location of admissible multipliers is shifted off the real axis . on the other hand ,",
    "the general linear size of the region decreases in this case .",
    "the figure 26 displays the exterior of the images of the unit disc under the mappings @xmath592 and @xmath593 where @xmath594 ( fig .",
    "[ fig26 ] ) .",
    "-trick ( with @xmath342 @xmath594 ) ]    it makes sense to use the formulas of the variation of the extremal coefficients in the case of 2-cycle stabilization as well .",
    "in this article , the actual problem of stabilization of not known in advance unstable periodic orbits of discrete chaotic systems is considered .",
    "the approach for solving the stabilization problem is based on the use of nonlinear delayed feedback control ( dfc ) , proposed in @xcite to stabilize an equilibrium and modified in @xcite for cycles ( there for the case @xmath595 ) . using non - linear ( non - linearity",
    "must be related to the original system ) dfc is the only way to avoid restrictions on the size of the area of possible localization of multipliers . for example , in @xcite it is shown that the linear dfc whith @xmath596 is applicable only in the case of localization of multipliers in the region @xmath597 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that increasing @xmath56 does not provide substantial advantages .",
    "namely , if the diameter of the areas of possible localization of multipliers are greater than 16 in the general case , or greater than 4 in the case of a simply connected region , then the linear dfc does not solve stabilization problem .    as it is shown in this article , the problem of limitation of the size of the region of multipliers location can be circumvented by using a nonlinear dfc with multiple delays , i.e. , when @xmath598 for @xmath599 the strength coefficients are found explicitly .",
    "the suggested control stabilizes all equilibriums and 2-cycles with negative multipliers .",
    "it is discovered an unexpected connection between the problem of determining the optimal coefficients and the classical fourier analysis as well as with geometric complex analysis .",
    "the problem of investigation of the stability of cycles of the length greater than 2 is reduced to the study of stability of cycles of shorter lengths ( including equilibria ) for an auxiliary control systems .",
    "aswas mentioned in @xcite , nonlinear dfc indeed has robust properties . in the context of the current problems",
    "it means that one control stabilizes all equilibriums ( or 2 - cycles ) with multipliers in @xmath600 where the value of @xmath571 depends on the number @xmath56 of coefficients in delayed feedback loop .",
    "theorems 2 and 3 implies the asymptotic dependence on the linear size of the region of location of multiples from @xmath56 at @xmath601 and that asymptotic is @xmath602    a. solyanik @xcite claims that this asymptotic dependence is still valid for an arbitrary @xmath548 he also claim an algorithm for constructing the coefficients of direct control , stabilizing cycles of arbitrary length",
    ".    other generalizations of the proposed scheme are possible . in particular , the point of interest is a construction of direct stabilizing controls for multidimensional mappings .",
    "preliminary investigations indicates that the strength coefficients in these tasks are also associated with fejr polynomial coefficients .",
