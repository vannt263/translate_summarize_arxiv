    "in the advent of increasingly elaborate synthesis techniques @xcite highly engineered van der waals ( vdw ) solids are emerging as promising candidates for a manifold of applications including electronic components @xcite , optoelectronics @xcite , thermoelectrics @xcite , and spintronics @xcite .",
    "since thermal transport plays a key role in many of these situations , it is important to develop a detailed understanding of the thermal conductivity in vdw solids .",
    "unfortunately , values for the thermal conductivities reported in the literature exhibit a wide spread .",
    "for example in the case of nominally single - crystalline mos@xmath1 , experimental values for the in - plane ( basal plane ) thermal lattice conductivity vary over one order of magnitude ranging from around @xcite up to @xcite at room temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : conductivity - mos2 ] ) .",
    "this can be partly attributed to the challenges associated with experimental measurements of the thermal conductivity in nanostructures with pronounced anisotropy , see e.g. , refs .  .",
    "possibly even more crucial are defects and sample size effects , as the growth of large high - quality tmd single crystals is very time consuming @xcite .",
    "the extreme sensitivity to structure has been possibly most impressively demonstrated in the case of wse@xmath1 @xcite , for which the out - of - plane ( through plane ) thermal conductivity @xmath2 has been shown to vary by almost two orders of magnitude at room temperature .",
    "this variation can in fact be rationalized in terms of the microstructure , in particular planar defects such as stacking faults and subtle variations in layer spacing @xcite .",
    "similar to the experimental data , calculated values for the thermal conductivity cover a wide range as well .",
    "_ ab - initio _ calculations based on boltzmann transport theory in combination with density functional theory have only become available relatively recently @xcite .",
    "still , as illustrated by the case of mos@xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : conductivity - mos2 ] ) , calculations have usually been restricted to monolayers @xcite .",
    "this is at least in part due to the fact that computational studies of bulk systems @xcite require taking into account the vdw forces that mediate interlayer binding .",
    "these interactions are , however , not captured by common semi - local exchange - correlation ( xc ) functionals @xcite , including widely popular functionals such as pbe @xcite and pbesol @xcite . in some cases",
    "this shortcoming has been addressed by using semi - empirical methods @xcite . as will be shown below , in general ,",
    "the structural parameters of tmds as well as other quantities that affect the thermal conductivity are , however , very sensitive to the treatment of exchange and correlation .",
    "furthermore , since vdw forces are rather weak and computational noise can blur anharmonic effects , both the choice of the xc functional and the convergence of the computational parameters require special care .    .",
    "calculations and experiments are from ( a ) @xcite , ( b ) @xcite , ( c ) @xcite , ( d ) @xcite , ( e ) @xcite , ( f ) @xcite , ( g ) @xcite , ( h ) @xcite , ( i ) @xcite , ( j ) @xcite , ( k ) @xcite , ( l ) @xcite , ( m ) @xcite , ( n ) @xcite , ( o ) @xcite .",

    "is for few - layer systems . ]",
    "this perspective motivates the present study , in which we have carefully evaluated both the in - plane and out - of - plane thermal conductivities of mo and w - based tmds . to this end",
    ", we employ a combination of density functional and boltzmann transport theory calculations based on the vdw density functional method @xcite in combination with a recently formulated consistent - exchange part @xcite , which has already been found to work very well for e.g. , wse@xmath1 @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we first demonstrate that this approach yields an excellent description of the structural parameters of mo and w - based tmds at finite temperatures .",
    "we then carefully assess the relevant computational parameters before conducting a comprehensive investigation of the thermal conductivities .",
    "since the largest contribution to the thermal conductivities stems from modes with mean free paths ( phonon - phonon scattering limited ) of more than @xmath3 , both in - plane and out - of - plane conductivities are in practice often limited by structural incoherence .",
    "the thermal conductivities @xmath4 are found to increase from mte@xmath1 to ms@xmath1 but , in opposition to the trend expected based on the group velocities , @xmath4 tends to be higher for ws@xmath1 than for the respective mo compound . this behavior is shown to be due to higher lifetimes in the former case , which can be rationalized in terms of the scattering condition and the different phononic band gaps .",
    "in general the thermal conductivity comprises both an electronic @xmath5 and a phononic ( lattice ) part @xmath6 . according to the wiedemann - franz law the electronic contribution @xmath5",
    "is closely related to the electrical conductivity . since the tmds of interest in the present work have comparably large band gaps @xmath5 is usually much smaller than @xmath6 .",
    "for example in the case of the in - plane conductivity in mos@xmath1 @xmath5 reaches only about 5%  of the value of @xmath6 at room temperature @xcite and the ratio is even smaller below 300k . in the present work ,",
    "we therefore focus entirely on the lattice contribution @xmath6 and from here on drop the subscript @xmath7 .    to calculate the lattice thermal conductivity we utilize boltzmann transport theory within the relaxation time approximation .",
    "in this approximation each mode @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the phonon wave - vector and @xmath10 is the band index , is associated with a relaxation time @xmath11 .",
    "the total relaxation time is the result of several scattering processes , and in the present work we consider phonon - phonon scattering as well as isotopic and boundary scattering .",
    "if one assumes that each scattering rate individually contributes in parallel , the total relaxation time for a phonon mode is given by matthiessen s rule , @xmath12    [ [ isotopic - scattering ] ] isotopic scattering + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    is the result of variations in the atomic masses due to the natural isotope distribution .",
    "the corresponding relaxation time contribution @xmath13 has been calculated according to second - order perturbation theory @xcite using isotope distributions and masses from ref .  .",
    "[ [ boundary - scattering ] ] boundary scattering + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    is accounted for by assuming that the mean free path ( mfp ) of any phonon mode is capped by an intrinsic length scale @xmath14 , which in the most simple case corresponds to the sample size @xcite , @xmath15 this expression represents the limit , in which the scattering event is fully diffusive , equivalent to a vanishing specularity parameter @xcite .",
    "below we will treat this model as a means to establish the characteristic length scale @xmath14 that is representative of the ( temperature independent ) structural homogeneity of the material .",
    "we note that the model was used in a similar fashion in ref .   to describe the effect of nanostructuring in zn chalcogenides .",
    "[ [ phonon - phonon - scattering ] ] phonon - phonon scattering + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    is computationally the most intricate contribution .",
    "the corresponding lifetime @xmath16 can be obtained using perturbation theory on top of a harmonic description of lattice vibrations .",
    "the phonon - phonon limited lifetime is then obtained as the inverse of the self energy @xmath17 , where the self - energy is given by @xcite @xmath18 here , @xmath19 is obtained from the third order interatomic force constant ( ifc ) matrix and @xmath20 is the bose - einstein distribution .",
    "the mode frequencies @xmath21 can be obtained in the usual fashion from the second order ifcs @xcite .",
    "phonon scattering processes must obey ( _ i _ ) momentum conservation , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a reciprocal lattice vector , and ( _ ii _ ) energy conservation , @xmath24 , where the signs are determined by the type of scattering event .",
    "condition ( _ i _ ) is included in the constructing of the third - order ifcs while condition ( _ ii _ ) is apparent in eq .  .",
    "the structure of the self - energy and accordingly the lifetimes is thus determined to a large extent by the geometry of the brillouin zone and the phonon dispersion @xcite .",
    "this observation allows one to identify general trends in the lifetime spectrum already on the basis of the phonon dispersion and thus the second - order ifcs . in this context the weighted joint density of states introduced by togo _",
    "@xcite is a very useful quantity . specifically , we considered the weighted joint density of states for so - called class 1 processes @xcite , which correspond to collisions by which two phonons combine to form one phonon .",
    "it is defined as class 2 processes ( decay of one phonon into two phonons ) are less relevant and therefore not considered further . ]",

    "@xmath28 thus effectively counts the number of collision processes that contribute to the phonon - phonon scattering time of a given mode . by comparison with the full expression one recognizes as the main difference the occurrence of third - order derivatives of the total energy in eq .",
    ", which represent the efficiency of the scattering processes that are energy and momentum allowed .",
    "by contrast , eq .   requires only knowledge of the second - order force constants .",
    "finally , the _ full lattice thermal conductivity tensor _ is obtained by summing over all modes @xcite @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the unit cell volume , @xmath31 denotes the number of @xmath32-points , @xmath33 is the group velocity , @xmath34 is the phonon mfp , and @xmath35 is the mode specific heat capacity . for analyzing , e.g. , the sensitivity of the thermal conductivity to structural inhomogeneities it is convenient to consider the cumulative thermal conductivity , which is given by @xmath36 if the mfp is uniformly limited to a constant value @xmath37 , one obtains the so - called small - grain conductivity @xcite , which is given by @xmath38 the small - grain conductivity represents the limit , in which scattering is dominated by an intrinsic length scale as for example in the case of nanostructuring .",
    "density functional theory calculations were carried out using the projector augmented wave method @xcite as implemented in the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite . to assess the sensitivity of our results to the treatment of exchange - correlation effects we used both the local density approximation ( lda ) and the van der waals density functional ( vdw - df ) method that captures non - local correlations @xcite .",

    "they are the result of the interlayer ( vdw ) interactions being much weaker than the intralayer ( mixed covalent / ionic ) bonding .",
    "this anisotropy has also been shown to give rise to a phonon focusing effect and a much lower minimum thermal conductivity than in the case of isotropic materials @xcite .",
    "the chemical trend for @xmath4 is analogous to the situation for the structural parameters , which was described in sect .",
    "[ sect : description - of - vdw - solids ] .",
    "the lattice parameters are the largest for the tellurides , which accordingly exhibit the smallest brillouin zone ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phonon - dispersions ] ) and generally yield smaller group velocities resulting in lower thermal conductivities , see eq .  .",
    "one might thus be led to use the group velocities and thus the small - grain conductivity @xmath67 as a ( computationally much cheaper ) predictor for the thermal conductivity .",
    "a closer inspection , however , reveals no correlation between @xmath67 and the full thermal conductivity @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : small - grain - conductivity ] ) , emphasizing the need to include phonon - phonon scattering at least at an approximate level , see e.g. , ref .  .",
    "compared to the other tmds in the case of the sulfides the transition metal species has a much more pronounced effect on the in - plane lattice thermal conductivity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : conductivity - comparison ] ) with values of and for mos@xmath1 and ws@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "this observation is supported by experimental data as measurements for bulk mos@xmath1 fall in the range between 85 and @xcite ( also see fig .",
    "[ fig : conductivity - mos2 ] ) , while a value of was recently measured for ws@xmath1 @xcite . since both the lattice parameters and the second - order ifcs of mos@xmath1 and ws@xmath1 are similar , the differences in phonon dispersion and thus group velocities arise primarily from the mass difference between mo and w ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phonon - dispersions ] ) . the lighter mass of mo leads to larger group velocities , which would suggest @xmath4 to be larger for mos@xmath1 , yet the opposite is the case .",
    "the difference thus must be traceable to the lifetimes .",
    "the largest contributions to the thermal conductivity in both materials come from modes with frequencies below [ fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison - mos2-ws2](a ) ] . in the case of",
    "ws@xmath1 the relative contributions in the interval between 2 and are , however , notably larger than in mos@xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the lifetimes , in particular between 3.5 and are much larger in ws@xmath1 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison - mos2-ws2](c ) ] than in mos@xmath1 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison - mos2-ws2](b ) ] .",
    "the longer lifetimes can be largely attributed to a much smaller number of allowed collision processes in this frequency range [ fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison - mos2-ws2](d ) ] , which in turn is the direct result of the large phonon band gap in the dispersion of ws@xmath1 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : phonon - dispersions](a ) ] .",
    "the phonon gaps in these materials are caused by the mass difference between cation and anion species , which is the largest for ws@xmath1 among the tmds considered in this work . if boundary scattering is included the relative importance of phonon - phonon scattering is reduced , which diminishes the difference between ws@xmath1 and mos@xmath1 ( fig .  [ fig : boundary - scattering - mos2-ws2 ] ) .     and",
    "ws@xmath1 with boundary scattering dimension @xmath14 . ]",
    "differences in lifetimes between mo and w - based tmds , albeit smaller than for the sulfides , are also present for the selenides and tellurides . in these materials",
    "the lifetime effect is , however , outweighed by the group velocity contribution ( compare the insets in fig .",
    "[ fig : conductivity - comparison ] ) .",
    "the present analysis nonetheless demonstrates the importance of lifetime effects for understanding the thermal conductivity in these materials .",
    "in the present work we investigated finite temperature properties as well as the lattice thermal conductivity in mo and w - based tmds employing a combination of density functional and boltzmann transport theory .",
    "the calculations were carried out using the vdw - df - cx functional , which was shown to yield excellent agreement with experimental lattice constants at room temperature with an average relative error below 0.2%  ( table  [ tab : structural - parameters - tmds ] ) .",
    "the calculated in - plane conductivities at room temperature are in good agreement with experimental data for high - purity material , when only phonon - phonon and isotopic scattering are included ( figs .",
    "[ fig : conductivity - mos2 ] and [ fig : conductivity - ws2-wse2 ] ) . explaining the experimental data over the entire temperature ,",
    "however , requires inclusion of at least one additional scattering mechanism ( here boundary scattering ) that limits the phonon mfp ( fig .",
    "[ fig : conductivity - ws2-wse2 ] ) .",
    "the latter effect is even more pronounced in the case of the out - of - plane conductivity , for which we obtain an intrinsic length scale of @xmath65 to be compared with @xmath68 in the in - plane situation .    the sensitivity of the thermal conductivity to structural inhomogeneities can be explained in terms of the long mfp of the modes that contribute the most strongly to @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cumulative - conductivity ] ) .",
    "the mfp of these modes ( including phonon - phonon and isotopic scattering ) is at least @xmath0 , which is comparable to silicon but much larger than e.g. , pbte .",
    "this behavior is promising for thermoelectric applications , where lowering the lattice part of the thermal conductivity is a widely employed approach for increasing the thermodynamic efficiency . on the other hand",
    ", it can pose problems for electronic and optoelectronic applications , which require a large @xmath4 for rapid heat dissipation .",
    "a comprehensive analysis shows that the thermal conductivity is primarily affected by the chalcogenide species and increases in the order te - se - s ( fig .",
    "[ fig : conductivity - comparison ] ) . as expected from the elemental masses , mote@xmath1 and mose@xmath1 exhibit a higher conductivity than the respective w - based tmds . for the sulfides",
    "the situation is inverted , which can be traced to the larger phononic band gap in the case of ws@xmath1 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : phonon - dispersions ] and [ fig : comparison - mos2-ws2 ] ) .",
    "this observation suggests that in principle phonon - engineering can be achieved not only via the group velocity term in eq .   and microstructuring but also via the phonon - phonon scattering .",
    "the present study provides a comprehensive set of lattice thermal conductivities for bulk tmds that establishes bounds set by phonon - phonon scattering and intrinsic length scales .",
    "it thereby forms the basis for future studies on these systems , which could focus e.g. , on vdw solids comprising different layers .",
