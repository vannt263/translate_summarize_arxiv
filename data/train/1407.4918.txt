    "the number of dark spots in the sun s surface has been counted in a systematic way since rudolf wolf introduced the concept , in the first half of the nineteenth century .",
    "more than any other solar observable , the sunspot number is considered the strongest signature of the 22-year magnetic cycle . moreover , since the sunspot number is the longest time series from all solar observables  @xcite , it makes it the preferred proxy to study the variability and irregularity of the solar magnetic cycle .    in the sun",
    "s interior the large scale magnetic field is generated by a magnetohydrodynamic dynamo that converts part of the kinetic energy of the plasma motions into magnetic energy .",
    "polarity reversals occur every 11 years approximately , as it can be observed directly in the sun s dipolar field , and taking a full 22-years to complete a magnetic cycle .",
    "in fact during each magnetic cycle , the sun experiences two periods of maximum magnetic activity , during which magnetic flux tubes created in the tachocline layer , rise to the sun s surface by the action of buoyancy , emerging as sunspots pairs @xcite .",
    "the polarity switch is also observed in the change of polarity alignment of these bipolar active regions .",
    "although we know that the solar dynamo resides within the convection zone , we still do nt have a complete picture where all the physical mechanisms operate @xcite .",
    "there is a strong consensus that the physical mechanism behind the production of the large scale toroidal field component , the so called @xmath0-effect , is located in the tachocline , a shear layer created by differential rotation and located at the base of the convection zone .",
    "the major source of uncertainty is the location of the @xmath1-effect , the physical mechanism responsible to convert toroidal into poloidal field and close the system . in truth",
    ", this effect could be in fact a collection of several physical mechanisms that operate at different places and with different efficiencies .",
    "some examples are the babcock - leighton mechanism that operates in the solar surface and converts the product of decaying active regions into poloidal field , or the action of the turbulent magnetic helicity that takes place in the bulk of the convection zone .",
    "one of the main questions that is still being debated is the quantification of the importance and relative contribution of each component to the operation of the solar dynamo . because different authors choose to give the leading role to one or another @xmath1 source term , there is vast number of dynamo models .",
    "most of these are two dimensional models ( usually referred as 2.5d because they include two spatial coordinates plus time ) and are constructed using the mean - field theory framework proposed by @xcite . despite some short - comes , fruit of the approximations and formulation used , this type of models running in the kinematic regime , i.e. with prescribed large scale flows , has been very popular within the solar community because they can explain many of the observable features of the solar cycle . a detailed discussion on solar dynamo models , stellar magnetism and corresponding references to the vast literature on this subject can be found in the reviews by @xcite and @xcite .    another way of tackling the solar dynamo problem is by producing 3d magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of the solar convection zone . these computer intensive simulations",
    "solve the full set of the mhd equations ( usually under the anelastic approximation ) and are fully dynamical in every resolved scale , i.e. they take into consideration the interactions between flow and field and vice - versa  unlike the kinematic regime usually used in mean field models , where only the flow influences the field .",
    "recently these simulations have started to show stable large scale dynamo behaviour and they are starting to emerge as virtual laboratories for understanding in detail some of the mechanisms behind the dynamo @xcite .    on the other end of the modelling spectrum , we can find oscillator models , that use simplified parameterizations of the main physical mechanisms that participate in the dynamo process .",
    "although in the sun s interior the magnetic field generated by the dynamo has a very rich and complex structure , as a consequence of the structure of the magnetohydrodynamic differential equations , some of its main properties can be understood by analyzing low order differential equations obtained by simplification and truncation of their original mhd counterparts",
    ". then , several properties of the cycle that can be extracted by studying these non - linear oscillator models , as is usually done in nonlinear dynamics .",
    "these models have a solid connection to dynamical systems and are , from the physics point of view the most simple .",
    "this does not mean that they are the easiest to understand because the reduction in the number of dimensions can sometimes be difficult to interpret ( viz .",
    "introduction section of @xcite ) . these low order dynamo models ( lodm ) ,",
    "as they are some times called , allow for fast computation and long integration times ( thousands of years ) when compared to their 2.5d and 3d counterparts .",
    "they can be thought as a first order approximation to study the impact of certain physical mechanisms in the dynamo solution , or some of the properties of the dynamo itself as a dynamical system .",
    "the variability exhibited by the sunspot number time series , inspired researchers to look for chaotic regimes in the equations that describe the dynamo . for a complete review on this subject consult @xcite and references therein .",
    "some of the first applications of lodm were done in this context ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these authors found solutions with cyclic behaviour and variable amplitude , including extended periods of low amplitude reminiscent of the grand minima behaviour we see in the sun .",
    "the downside of these initial works was the fact that although the proposed model equations made sense from a mathematical point of view , the physics realism they attained was small .",
    "these low order models , with higher or lower degrees of physical complexity , can be used in many areas and several of their results have been validated by 2.5d spatially distributed mean field models , which grants them a certain degree of robustness .",
    "this happens specially in lodm whose formulation is directly derived from mhd or mean - field theory equations .",
    "some examples of the results obtained with lodm that have been validated by more complex mean field models are : the study of the parameter space , variability and transitions to chaos in dynamo solutions @xcite ; the role of lorentz force feedback on the meridional flow @xcite ; and the influence of stochastic fluctuations in the meridional circulation and in the @xmath1-effect @xcite .",
    "some models even include time delays that embody the spatial segregation and communication between the location of source layers of the @xmath1- and @xmath0-effects .",
    "these have been applied to a more general stellar context by @xcite and recently , @xcite showed that one of this type of time delay lodm that incorporates two different @xmath1 source terms working in parallel , can explain how the sun can enter and exit in a self - consistently way from a grand minimum episode .",
    "a couple of lodm even ventured in the `` dangerous '' field of predictions .",
    "for example @xcite combined his lodm with an autoregressive model in order to forecast the amplitude of future solar cycles .    in this article",
    "we show how can one of these lodm be used as a tool to study the properties of the solar magnetic cycle . for this purpose",
    "we use the international sunspot number time series during the past 23 solar magnetic cycles .",
    "nevertheless , the main focus of this work is to present a strategy inspired by helioseismology , were an _ inversion methodology _",
    "is used to infer variations of some of the lodm parameters over time .",
    "since these parameters are related to the physical mechanisms that regulate the solar dynamo , this should in principle , allow for a _ first order _ reconstruction of the main dynamo parameters over the last centuries . in a similar manner to helioseismology , the comparison between model solutions and data can be done by means of a _ forward method _ in which solar observational data is directly compared with the theoretical predictions , or by means of a _",
    "backward method _ in which the data is used to infer the behaviour of leading physical quantities of the theoretical model .",
    "naturally , it is necessary to develop an inversion technique or methodology that allows to reconstruct the quantities that have changed during the evolution of solar dynamo .",
    "this type of studies is well suited to explore several aspects of the solar and stellar dynamo theory .",
    "this can be done by : _",
    "( i ) _ building a tool to study the dynamo regimes operating in stars ; _ ( ii ) _ establishing an inversion methodology to infer the leading quantities responsible for the dynamics and variability of the solar cycle over time ; _ ( iii ) _ comparing the dynamo numerical simulations with the observational data ; _ ( iv ) _ use this tool as a toy model to test global properties of the solar dynamo .    here",
    "we particularly focus in discussing the three last items of this list , with special attention on the development of an inversion method applied here to the sunspot number time series .",
    "this is used to infer some of the dynamics of the solar dynamo back - in - time . in principle",
    "this should allow us to determine the variation profiles of the quantities that drive the evolution of the magnetic cycle during the last few centuries .    in section  [ sec : lodmlsmf ]",
    ", we present a non - linear oscillator derived from the equations of a solar dynamo that is best suited to represent the sunspot number . in section  [ sec : lodminversion ] , we discuss how the non - linear oscillator analogue can be used to invert some of the leading quantities related with solar dynamo . in section",
    "[ sec : smc ] is discussed how solar observational data is use to infer properties of the solar magnetic cycle . in section  [ sec : numericmodels ] we present a discussion about how the low order dynamo model can be used to test the basic properties of modern axisymmetric models and numerical simulations , as well to infer some leading properties of such dynamo models . in section  [ sec :",
    "outlook ] , we discuss the outlook for the sun and other stars .",
    "the basic equations describing the dynamo action in the interior of a star are obtained from the magnetic - hydrodynamic induction , and the navier - stokes equations augmented by a lorentz force  @xcite . under the usual kinematic approximation the dynamo problem consists in finding a flow field with a velocity @xmath2 that has the necessary properties capable of maintaining the magnetic field , @xmath3 against ohmic dissipation  @xcite .    for a star like the sun",
    "such dynamo models should be able to reproduce well - known observational features such as : cyclic magnetic polarity reversals with a period of 22 years , equatorward migration of @xmath3 during the cycle ( dynamo wave ) , the @xmath4 phase lag between poloidal and toroidal components of @xmath3 , the antisymmetric parity across the equator , predominantly negative / positive magnetic helicity in the northern / southern hemisphere , as well as many of the empirical correlations found in the sunspot records , like the waldmeier rule  anti - correlation between cycle duration and amplitude ; the gnevyshev - ohl rule  alternation of higher - than - average and lower - than - average cycle amplitude and grand minima episodes ( like the maunder minimum )  epochs of very low surface magnetic activity that span over several cycles . given the amount of complex features that a solar dynamo model has to reproduce , the task at hand is far from simple .",
    "the vast majority of dynamo models currently proposed to explain the evolution of the solar magnetic cycle ( kinematic mean - field models ) became very popular with the advance of helioseismology inversions and the inclusion of the differential rotation profile . in the kinematic regime approximation , the flow field @xmath2 is prescribed and only the magnetic induction equation is used to determine the evolution of @xmath3 . generally , the large scale magnetic field , the one responsible for most of the features observed in the sun is modelled as the interaction of field and flow where two source terms ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) naturally emerge from mean - field theory  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "from the mean - field electrodynamics , the induction equation reads    @xmath5    where @xmath2 is the large - scale mean flow , and @xmath6 is the total magnetic diffusivity ( including the turbulent diffusivity and the molecular diffusivity ) .",
    "currently , as inferred from helioseismology , @xmath2 can be interpreted as a large - scale flow with at least two major flow components , the differential rotation throughout the solar interior , and the meridional circulation in the upper layers of the solar convection  @xcite .",
    "given all the points above , and based on their popularity among the community , we start our study by considering a reference model based in the kinematic mean - field flux transport framework .",
    "although the results obtained here are based on this specific type of model , most of the analysis method used , as well the conclusions reached , can easily be extended to other models . as usual , under the simplification of axi - symmetry the large - scale magnetic field @xmath3 can be conveniently expressed as the sum of toroidal and poloidal components , that in spherical polar coordinates @xmath7 can be written as    @xmath8    similarly , the large - scale flow field @xmath2 as probed by helioseismology can be expressed as the sum of an axisymmetric azimuthal ( differential rotation ) and poloidal ( meridional flow ) components :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 , @xmath0 in the angular velocity and @xmath11 is the velocity of the meridional flow . accordingly",
    ", such decomposition of @xmath3 ( that satisfy the induction equation  [ eq : vecb ] ) and @xmath2 leads to the following set of equations :    @xmath12\\cdot \\nabla \\omega -\\gamma ( b_\\phi ) b_\\phi \\label{eq : bphi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 is the magnetic diffusivity and @xmath1 is the source term of @xmath13 ( the mechanism to convert toroidal to poloidal field ) .",
    "moreover , following the suggestions of @xcite we also considered that the toroidal field can be removed from the layers where it is produced by magnetic buoyancy and obeying @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a constant related to the removal rate and @xmath16 is the plasma density .",
    "as the sun s magnetic field changes sign from one solar cycle to the next it is a plausible idea to attribute alternating signs in odd / even cycles also to other solar activity indicators such as the sunspot number ( ssn ) .",
    "the resulting time series displays cyclic variations around zero in the manner of an oscillator .",
    "this suggests an oscillator as the simplest mathematical model of the observed ssn series . as , however",
    ", the profile of sunspot cycles is known to be markedly asymmetric ( a steep rise in 34 years from minimum to maximum , followed by a more gradual decline to minimum in @xmath17 years ) , a simple linear oscillator would be clearly a very poor representation of the sunspot cycle .",
    "a _ damped _ linear oscillator @xmath18 will , on the other hand , naturally result on asymmetric profiles similar to what is observed .",
    "the obvious problem that the oscillation will ultimately decay due to the damping could be remedied somewhat artificially by applying a periodic forcing or by reinitializing the model at each minimum . a much more natural way to counteract the damping , however ,",
    "is the introduction of nonlinearities into the equation indeed , such nonlinearities are naturally expected to be present in any physical system , see below .",
    "as long as the nonlinearity is relatively weak , the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be expanded into taylor series according to @xmath21 . due to the requirement of symmetry ( i.e. the behaviour of the oscillators should be invariant to a sign change in @xmath21 ) only terms of even degree will arise in the taylor series . to leading order , then , we can substitute @xmath22 into equation ( [ eq : linosc ] ) resulting in @xmath23    in the particular case when @xmath24 ( i.e. the nonlinearity affects the damping only ) and the other parameters are positive , the system described by equation ( [ eq : nonlinosc ] ) is known as a van der pol oscillator .",
    "the alternative case when nonlinearity affects the directional force / frequency only , i.e. @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , in turn , represents a _",
    "duffing oscillator_. due to their simplicity and universal nature these two systems are among those most extensively studied in nonlinear dynamics .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the oscillator is non - decaying , i.e. the origin is repeller , whenever @xmath28 ( negative damping ) in the case of a van der pol oscillator and/or @xmath29 and @xmath30 in a duffing oscillator.when a nonlinearity is present in both paramters ( i.e. @xmath31 and @xmath32 are both non - zero ) a combined _ van der pol - duffing oscillator _ results .",
    "the van der pol ",
    "duffing oscillator , however , is more than just a good heuristic model of the solar cycle .",
    "in fact , an oscillator equation of this general form can be derived by a truncation of the dynamo equations . as noted before",
    ", we are especially interested in capturing the temporal dynamics associated with the large scale magnetic field . in order to construct a low order model aimed at capturing this dynamics",
    ", we follow the procedures described in @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested by @xcite and @xcite that a dimensional truncation of the dynamo equations ( [ eq : ap ] ) and ( [ eq : bphi ] ) is an effective method to reduce the system s dimensions and capture phenomena just on that scale . following that ansatz , gradient and laplacian operators are approximated by a typical length scale of the system @xmath33 ( e.g. convection zone length or width of the tachocline ) , leading to @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "analogously this can be interpreted as a collapse of all spatial dimensions , leaving only the temporal behaviour . in terms of dynamical systems",
    ", we are projecting a higher dimensional space into a single temporal plane .",
    "after grouping terms in @xmath36 and @xmath13 ( now functions only dependent of the time ) we get @xmath37 where we have defined the _ structural coefficients _ , @xmath38 , as @xmath39    we now concentrate in creating an expression for the time evolution of @xmath36 since it is the field component directly associated with the productions of sunspots .",
    "we derive expression ( [ eq : dbdt ] ) in order to the time , and substitute ( [ eq : dadt ] ) in it to take away the @xmath13 dependence yielding    @xmath40    where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are model parameters that depend directly on the structural coefficients .",
    "the name used to describe @xmath38 comes from the fact that these coefficients contain all the background physical structure ( rotation , meridional circulation , diffusivity , etc . )",
    "in which the magnetic field evolves .",
    "this oscillator ( equation  [ eq : vdp ] ) is a van der pol - duffing oscillator and it appears associated with many types of physical phenomena that imply auto - regulated systems .",
    "this equation is a quite general result which @xmath3 should satisfy . in this case , unlike in the classical van der pol - duffing oscillator , the parameters are interconnected by a set of relations that link the present oscillation model with the original set of dynamo equations ( [ eq : ap]-[eq : bphi ] ) .",
    "this interdependency between parameters will eventually constrain the solution s space . as in the classical case , @xmath45 controls the frequency of the oscillations or the period of the solar magnetic cycle , @xmath20 controls the asymmetry ( or non - linearity ) between the rising and falling parts of the cycle and @xmath32 affects directly the amplitude .",
    "the @xmath31 parameter , related to buoyancy loss mechanism sets the overall amplitude peak amplitude of the solution .",
    "figure ( [ fig:1 ] ) shows the solution of equation ( [ eq : vdp ] ) in a time vs. amplitude diagram ( left ) and in a @xmath46 , @xmath47 phase space . from this figure",
    "we find that this dynamo solution , under suitable parametrization ( viz .",
    "next section ) is a self - regulated system that rapidly relaxes to a stable 22-year oscillation . in the phase space",
    "the solution tend to a limit cycle or attractor .",

    "in order to estimate values for the coefficients in equation ( [ eq : vdp ] ) , @xcite and @xcite fitted this oscillator model either to a long period of the solar activity ( several solar cycles ) or to each magnetic cycle individually .",
    "we shall return to this point in subsequent sections .",
    "a more general approach to the problem of finding the parameter combinations with which the classical van der pol - duffing oscillator returns solar - like solutions was taken by @xcite .",
    "the authors mapped the parameter space of the oscillator by adding stochastic noise to its parameters using different methods .",
    "the objective was to constrain the parameter regime where this nonlinear model shows the observed attributes of the sunspot cycle , the most important requirement being the presence of the waldmeier effect @xcite according to the definition of @xcite .",
    "noise was introduced either as an ornstein  uhlenbeck process @xcite or as a piecewise constant function keeping a constant value for the interval of the correlation time .",
    "the effect of this noise was assumed to be either additive or multiplicative .",
    "the amplitudes and correlation times of the noise defined the phase space .",
    "the attributes of the oscillator model were first examined in the case of the van der pol oscillator ( no duffing cubic term ) with perturbation either in the nonlinearity parameter , @xmath32 or the damping parameter , @xmath20 , as shown in the equations below :    @xmath53\\dot{x}\\\\      \\label{e : vdp - xi}\\ddot x&=&-\\omega_0 ^ 2x-\\mu_0\\left [ \\xi(t ) x^2 - 1\\right]\\dot{x}.      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the constant parameters , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 used were taken from the fitted values listed by @xcite .",
    "note that in this simple case , variations in these parameters were assumed to be independent from each other , whereas in reality they are interrelated ( see equation  [ eq : vdp ] ) .",
    "the results show that the model presents solar - like solutions when a multiplicative noise is applied to the nonlinearity parameter , as in equation ( [ e : vdp - xi ] ) .",

    "the noise applied is shown in the top and middle panels .",
    "the duffing parameter was here given a constant value @xmath59 .",
    "]    as a next step towards a fully general study , let us consider the case where both @xmath32 and @xmath20 are simultaneously perturbed and the duffing term @xmath60 is also kept in the oscillator equation ( [ eq : nonlinosc ] ) .",
    "noise is applied to @xmath20 but it also affects @xmath32 as the values of @xmath32 and @xmath20 are assumed to be related as @xmath61 @xcite ; here , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are constants .",
    "a mapping of the parameter space shows that in this case solar - like solutions are more readily reproduced compared to the case when only one parameter was assumed to vary ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nmpk201x ] ) .",
    "this finding is in line with the information derived from the lodm developed in the previous section .",
    "an ongoing study shows that the corresponding time dependence in the duffing parameter , as predicted by the lodm , has a significant effect on the character of the solution .",
    "we note that additive noise was first applied to one parameter ( @xmath32 ) of a van der pol oscillator by @xcite but the focus of that work was on reproducing cycle to cycle fluctuations , withour considering the waldmeier effect .",
    "this model was further analysed by @xcite ( and references therein ) who studied the behavior of the hurst exponent of this system and concluded that this type of fluctuations implies that the stochastic process which underlies the solar cycle is not simply brownian .",
    "this means that long - range time correlations could probably exist , opening the way to the possibility of forecasts on time scales comparable to the cycle period .",
    "an attempt to introduce the effects of such non - gaussian noise statistics into the lodm was made by @xcite who suggest that this may contribute to cyclic variations of solar activity on time scales shorter than 11 years .",
    "in the previous example a perturbation method was studied in order to find solar like solutions for this non - linear oscillator .",
    "another way of thinking is to pair the oscillator directly to some solar observable and try to constraint its parameters . as mentioned in the introduction we choose the international sunspot number , @xmath64 and we use it to build a proxy of the toroidal magnetic component .",
    "since the @xmath64 is usually taken to be proportional to the toroidal field magnetic energy that erupts at the solar surface ( @xmath65 ) , @xcite , this makes it ideal for compare with solutions of the lodm . taking this in consideration ,",
    "@xcite have built a toroidal field proxy based on the sunspot number by following the procedure proposed by  , i.e. @xmath66 .",
    "details about the construction of the toroidal proxy ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the vertical thin dotted lines represent solar cycle minima . ]",
    "the solution obtained for equation ( [ eq : vdp ] ) presented in figure ( [ fig:1 ] ) shows that the solar cycle is a self - regulated system that tends to a stable solution defined by an attractor ( limit cycle ) .",
    "if we allow for the different physical processes responsible for the solar dynamo and embedded in the structural coefficients ( [ eq : c1 ] , [ eq : c2 ] and [ eq : c3 ] ) , i.e. the differential rotation , the meridional circulation flow , the @xmath1 mechanism , and the magnetic diffusion , to change slowly from cycle to cycle then we start to observe deviations from the equilibrium state . if deviations from this sort of dynamical balance occur , such that if one of these processes changes due to an external cause , the other mechanisms also change to compensate this variation and ensure that the solar cycle finds a new equilibrium .",

    "if one of the parameter s variation is very large the system can be dramatically affected , leading to a quite distinct evolution path like the ones found during the solar grand minima .",
    "we will develop this subject in a subsequent section .",
    "solutions with fluctuation similar to those we see on the solar cycle are easily set by variations in the @xmath20 parameter ( and the physical processes associated with it ) . by definition the structural coefficient that regulates this parameter ( @xmath72 ) also has an important role in the other parameters ( @xmath45 , @xmath32 and @xmath31 ) . in the lodm equation ( [ eq : vdp ] ) the @xmath20 and @xmath73 quantities",
    "regulate the strength and the non - linearity of the damping .",
    "moreover , an occasional variation on @xmath20 , like a perturbation on the meridional flow amplitude , @xmath74 ( see structural coefficients  [ eq : c1 ] ) will affect all sets of parameters leading to the solar dynamo ( equation  [ eq : vdp ] ) to find a new equilibrium , which will translate into the solar magnetic cycle observable like the sunspots number , showing an irregular behaviour .",
    "the well - known relation discover by max waldmeier  @xcite , that the time that the sunspot number takes to rise from minimum to maximum is inversely proportional to the cycle amplitude in naturally captured by the lodm assuming discrete variations in @xmath20 .",
    "notice that the waldmeier effect occurs as a consequence of the limit cycle becoming increasingly sharp as @xmath20 increases , i.e. , the sunspot number amplitude increases as the cycle s rising times gets shorter .",
    "from the physical point of view , based on observations , we know that in the sun some of the physical background structures that are taken as constant in our standard dynamo solution are nt so . in order to test that specific changes of the background state lead to the observed changes in the amplitude of the solar cycle , the following strategy was devised . at a first approximation",
    "we assume that the structural coefficients can change only discretely in time , more specifically from cycle to cycle while the magnetic field is allowed to evolve continuously .",
    "the idea is that changing coefficients will generate theoretical solutions with different amplitudes , periods and eigen - shapes at different times and by comparing these different solution pieces with the observed variations in the solar magnetic field , we are able to infer information about the physical mechanisms associated with the coefficients .    to do this we compare our theoretical solution with a proxy built from the international monthly averaged ssn since 1750 to the present .",
    "as mentioned before we assume that @xmath75 .",
    "the proxy data is separated into individual cycles and fitted using equation ( [ eq : vdp ] ) , considering that the buoyancy properties of the system are immutable , i.e. @xmath76 is constant throughout the time series .",
    "this means that when we fit the lodm to solar cycle @xmath77 , we will retrieve the set of @xmath78 coefficients that best describe that cycle .",
    "this allows to probe how these coefficients vary from cycle to cycle and consequently how the physical mechanisms associated with them evolve in time @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq : vdp ] ) is afterwards solved by changing the parameters to their fit value , at every solar minimum using a stepwise function ( similar to that presented in figure ( [ fig : vp_c1_var ] ) for @xmath72 ) .",
    "figures ( [ fig : vp_c1_var ] ) and ( [ fig : fit ] ) highlight this procedure . the fact that such a simplified dynamo model can get this degree of resemblance with the observed data just by controlling one or two parameters is an indication that it captures the most important physical processes occurring in the sun .",
    "the simple procedure previously described allows to reconstruct the behavior of solar parameters back in time . using an improved fitting methodology",
    ", @xcite obtained with this model the reconstruction of the variation levels of the solar meridional circulation for every solar ( sunspot ) cycle over the last 250 years .",
    "one must notice that in this specific lodm the amplitude of the cycle depends directly on the amplitude of the meridional flow during the previous cycle .",
    "it is completely possible to imagine that other models that consider a different theoretical setup might return a different behaviour .",
    "looking at equation ( [ eq : c1 ] ) , we can see that the coefficient @xmath72 depends on two physical parameters , the magnetic diffusivity , @xmath6 , and the amplitude of the meridional circulation , @xmath74 .",
    "the magnetic diffusivity of the system is a property tightly connected with turbulent convection and is generally believed to change only in time scales of the order of stellar evolution .",

    "it is quite encouraging to find that such class of dynamo models for which the @xmath74 changes overtime successfully reproduced the main features found in the observational data .",

    "in particular , all the simulations show the existence of low amplitudes on the sunspot number time series between 1800 and 1840 and between 1870 and 1900 .",
    "the simulation that best reproduces the solar data corresponds to the model ssnrec[3 ] ( see fig .  [",

    "the fact that for one of the sunspot models  model ssnrec[3 ] , it presents a strong level of correlation with the observational time series , lead us to believe that the main idea behind this _ backward approach _ is correct and it is very likely that the inverted @xmath74 variation is probably very close to the @xmath74 variation that happens in the real sun .",
    "clearly , under the assumed theoretical framework the meridional circulation is the leading quantity responsible for the magnetic variability found in the sunspot number time series and current solar dynamo models are able to reproduce such variability to a certain degree .",
    "so far , the vast majority of the lodm applications presented here followed the traditional assumption that the solar dynamo can be correctly modeled in the kinematic regime , where only the plasma flows influence the production of magnetic field , and not the other way around .",
    "this kinematic approximation is used in the vast majority of the present 2.5d spatially resolved dynamo models .    in the last couple of years",
    "though , evidence started to appear supporting the claim that this kinematic regime might be overlooking important physical mechanisms for the evolution of the dynamo .",
    "the idea that the meridional flow strength can change over time and affect the solar cycle amplitude coupled with the measurements of  @xcite and  @xcite indicate that the observed variation in this flow is highly correlated with the levels of magnetic activity .",
    "this leads to the fundamental question : _ `` is the flow driving the field or is the field driving the flow ? ''",
    "_    the first clues are starting to appear from 3d mhd simulations of solar convection .",
    "the recent analysis of the output of one of the large - eddy global mhd simulations of the solar convection zone done by @xcite shows interesting clues .",
    "these simulations solve the full set of mhd equations in the anelastic regime , in a broad , thermally - forced stratified plasma spherical shell mimicking the scz and are fully dynamical on all spatiotemporally - resolved scales .",
    "this means that a two way interaction between field and flow is always present during the simulation .",
    "the analysis shows that the interaction between the toroidal magnetic field and the meridional flow in the base of the convection zone indicates that the magnetic field is indeed acting on the equatorward deep section of this flow , accelerating it .",
    "this observed relationship runs contrary to the usually assumed kinematic approximation .    in order to check",
    "if this non - kinematic regime has any impact in the long term dynamics of the solar dynamo , @xcite implemented a term that accounts for the lorentz force feedback in a lodm similar to the one presented here .",
    "this allows to fully isolate the global aspects of the dynamical interactions between the meridional flow and magnetic field in a simplified way .",
    "they assumed that the large - scale meridional circulation , @xmath74 , is divided into a `` kinematic '' constant part , @xmath79 ( due to angular momentum distribution ) and a time dependent part , @xmath80 , that encompasses the lorentz feedback of the magnetic field .",
    "therefore they redefine @xmath74 as @xmath81 where the time dependent part evolves according to @xmath82    the first term is a magnetic nonlinearity representing the lorentz force and the second is a `` newtonian drag '' that mimics the natural resistance of the flow to an outside kinematic perturbation . under these conditions the lorentz force associated with the cyclic large - scale magnetic field",
    "acts as a perturbation on the otherwise dominant kinematic meridional flow .",
