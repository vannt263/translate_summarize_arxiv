    "tracing the values of the fundamental constants through the history of the universe provides strong constraints on the possibility of cosmologies other than the standard @xmath9cdm universe and new physics that deviates from the standard model . in this investigation",
    "we use the observed limits on the variation of the proton to electron mass ratio @xmath4 as a new input parameter for three quintessence cosmologies and k - essence .",
    "each of these cosmologies postulates a rolling scalar field @xmath1 with a potential @xmath0 .",
    "realistic models of this class expect the scalar field to also have non - zero couplings to sectors other than gravity unless an unknown symmetry is postulated to suppress them @xcite . here",
    "we assume the simplest non - vanishing coupling to the electromagnetic sector and a unification scenario of the type described in @xcite that leads to a change in @xmath4 that is related to a change in @xmath3 .    at the epoch of each @xmath10 measurement",
    "there is a constraint placed on the product of the coupling of @xmath4 to the rolling scalar field and the equation of state parameter @xmath2 that is independent of the cosmology except for the form of the equation describing the dark energy density @xmath11 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath4 and @xmath2 within those constraints , however , is dependent on the particular cosmology .",
    "we investigate one freezing cosmology , slow roll quintessence , and 3 thawing cosmologies , hilltop quintessence , non - minimal quintessence and k - essence .",
    "freezing models start with the equation of state parameter w different from @xmath12 at early times and approaching @xmath12 at the present time while thawing models start with w close to @xmath12 at early times and deviate from @xmath12 at the present epoch .",
    "each of these cosmologies has the advantage of having a family of solutions which is a function of a small number of parameters ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) we will follow the methodology laid out in @xcite for just slow roll quintessence to investigate the constraints on all four cosmologies .",
    "appendix  [ s - curs ] gives a comprehensive list of measurements of @xmath4 using astronomical observations .",
    "based on this list table  [ tab - con ] gives the most constraining limits on the value of @xmath13 .",
    "the listings for radio observations of pks1830 - 211 and b0218 + 357 give the @xmath14 limits about a null result .",
    "all of the other observations contain the null result in their @xmath15 limits .",
