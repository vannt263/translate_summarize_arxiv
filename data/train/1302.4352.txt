    "tadpole galaxies consist of a large star - forming clump at one end ( the _ head _ ) and a long diffuse region to one side ( the _ tail _ ) .",
    "this asymmetric morphology is rather common at high redshift but rare in the local universe .",
    "for example , tadpoles constitute 10% of all galaxies",
    "larger than 10 pixels in the hubble ultra deep field ( udf ) @xcite , and they represent 6% of the udf galaxies identified by @xcite and @xcite using automated search algorithms . in contrast , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) find only 0.2%  tadpoles among the star - forming local galaxies of the kiso survey by @xcite .",
    "this decrease suggests the tadpole morphology to represent a common but transit phase during the assembly of some galaxies .",
    "since local tadpole galaxies are very low mass objects compared to their high redshift analogues @xcite , the phase must be already over for the local descendants of high redshift tadpoles .",
    "another independent observation also suggests that the tadpole morphology characterizes a very early phase of evolution . from the point of view of their chemical content ,",
    "extremely metal poor ( xmp ) galaxies are the least evolved objects in the local universe .",
    "they represent only 0.1% of the galaxies in an arbitrary nearby volume ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but a significant fraction of these chemically primitive objects turn out to have tadpole or cometary shape .",
    "this association between low metallicity and tadpole shape suggests that they are attributes characteristic of very young systems .",
    "the tadpole structure could have a variety of origins .",
    "@xcite showed lopsided ring - like galaxies that would look like tadpoles if viewed edge - on .",
    "tadpoles could also result from mergers or close galaxy - galaxy interactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , this merger scenario can not be the universal pathway to tadpole formation , at least not locally , since the class of dwarf local tadpoles tends to be relatively isolated and lacks obvious tidal features .",
    "another possibility is that the lopsided starburst results from ram compression by motion through the intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "tadpoles could be disks with star formation triggered on the leading side and the rest visible as a red tail of older stars .",
    "alternatively , they could be heavily stripped galaxies with star formation and old stars at the leading edge , and a tail made from star formation in the stripped gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the scenario in which dwarf galaxies are converted into dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the halos of larger galaxies @xcite or in galaxy clusters @xcite could involve a tadpole phase as the gas and young stars are pulled behind .",
    "a third possibility is that some tadpoles are normal disk galaxies with a large turbulent jeans length for gravitational collapse of their interstellar medium .",
    "this happens in galaxies that have either small rotational velocities or large turbulent motions , and in this case only large star forming clumps can be produced @xcite .",
    "if there is only one clump at any particular time , then it will appear as a tadpole viewed from the right perspective .",
    "a fourth possibility is that the head - tail structure results from propagating star formation across a disk .",
    "finally , as we propose in this paper , the head of the tadpole may result from accretion of external flows of pristine gas , that penetrate the dark matter halo and hit and heat a pre - existing disk .",
    "cosmological simulations predict cold - flow buildup to be the main mode of galaxy formation @xcite , and the incoming gas is expected to form giant clumps that spiral in and merge into a central spheroid @xcite .",
    "in addition , inflow of low - metallicity gas seems to be suggested by distorted hi velocities and morphologies of some local star - forming galaxies ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "it is important to realize that the different formation mechanisms mentioned above are not mutually exclusive , but exhibit a large degree of overlap between them .",
    "for example , the cold - flow accretion may be considered as a ( minor-)merger accretion , and it may also be regarded as the interaction of the galaxy with the ( filamentary ) intergalactic medium .    in this context of galaxy formation , we examined a sample of fourteen tadpole galaxies in the local universe for comparison with high - redshift tadpoles ( paper  i ) .",
    "these local tadpoles seem to form a continuous sequence with the udf tadpoles studied by @xcite . with regards to their photometric properties ,",
    "local tadpoles occupy the low mass end in sequences such as star formation , surface density and mass - to - light ratio .",
    "in addition , the radial intensity profiles of the local tadpoles show an exponential decrease at large galactocentric distances , which was interpreted as evidence for an underlying disk .",
    "the work in paper  i is followed up in the present paper . in order to determine the dynamical properties and metallicities of local tadpoles , we measure h@xmath0 spectra along the head - tail direction in a representative fraction of the original sample .",
    "the results reported here show the galaxies to be rotating structures with an unexpected metallicity pattern , which may shed light into the nature of the tadpole morphology .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sect .",
    "[ observations ] describes the observations , the main steps of the reduction , and the main properties of the resulting spectra .",
    "section  [ determination ] details the approximations used along the work to derive physical parameters from spectra .",
    "section  [ dynamical_properties ] analyzes the dynamical properties of the galaxies , their rotation curves ( rcs ) and linewidths .",
    "these are used to infer dynamical masses , which are then compared with the stellar masses derived in paper  i ( sect .",
    "[ dynmasses ] ) .",

    "[ notes_on_galax ] .",
    "the results of our observation in the context of tadpoles as dynamically young disks are discussed in sect .  [ discussion ] .",
    "the sample of local tadpole galaxies selected in paper  i comes from the kiso survey of uv intense galaxies @xcite . among those galaxies labelled in the kiso catalog as clumpy or having conspicuous hii regions ,",
    "we visually inspected 158 with images in sdss - dr7 @xcite . then tadpoles were subjectively selected as those objects with lopsided light distribution , so that the brightest clump is far to one end and the rest of the galaxy is mostly featureless .",
    "this inspection rendered only 13 targets , which we completed with one additional galaxy with similar features from the university of michigan survey of emission - line objects @xcite .",
    "half of the sample in paper  i was randomly selected for the follow - up work presented in this paper .",
    "the observing program was aimed at determining the dynamical properties of the galaxies based on long slit spectroscopic observations along the well - defined head - tail direction ( see fig .  [ images ] ) .",
    "the project was planned for the spectrograph ids of the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos @xcite .",
    "it provides adequate spectral resolution to determine centroids of emission lines with an accuracy better than 10kms@xmath4 , which suffices to characterize rcs even for dwarf galaxies .",
    "the original project could not be completed due to poor weather conditions , so it was finished using service time of the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) , operated in the same observatory @xcite .",
    "the observing logbook is summarized in table  [ logbook ] .",
    "the used ids@int setup includes a grating with 1800  linesmm@xmath4 , which provides a scale in the spectrograph focal plane of 0.32pix@xmath4 equivalent to 044pix@xmath4 .",
    "the spectral resolution is set by the width of the 1  slit , which corresponds to 2.2pix , or 0.73 , or 33 kms@xmath4 in h@xmath0 .",
    "the camera covers some 700  around the central wavelength , which was tuned to h@xmath0 , and which automatically included the line [",
    "nii]@xmath26583 used in our metallicity estimates ( sect .  [ determination ] ) .",
    "the tadpoles kiso3193 , kiso3867 , kiso5149 and kiso8466 were observed with this setup ( table  [ logbook ] ) . figure  [ reduction ] shows one of them as an example .",
    "the image contains the spectral region around h@xmath0 .",
    "the reduction procedure included the standard bias and flatfield corrections , cosmic ray elimination , as well as removal of sky emission lines .",
    "the typical signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio in the peak h@xmath0 emission exceeds 500 , and it decreases down to one in the outskirts of the galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ reduction ] , bottom panel ) . this s",
    "/ n is achieved after integrating for some one and a half hours ( table  [ logbook ] ) .",
    "seeing was of the order of 1   ( table  [ logbook ] ) .",
    "the other three galaxies , kiso5639 , kiso6669 , and kiso6877 were observed with the not telescope with an observational setup equivalent to the previous one .",
    "we used the alfosc spectrograph which , together with a high resolution grism , provided a scale of 0.26pix@xmath5 019pix@xmath4 at h@xmath0 .",
    "this pixel size over - samples the spectrum , whose resolution was set by the 09 wide slit . in order to match the pixel size to the actual resolution , the original data were re - binned @xmath6 , yielding the final resolution indicated in table  [ logbook ] .",
    "the data reduction followed the standard process mentioned above , with a small difference worthwhile mentioning .",
    "the standard procedure includes using images of the sky taken during twilight to characterize ( and then to correct for ) large - scale illumination gradients in the images .",
    "such sky - flat images corresponding to kiso6877 were not available . for reduction we used those from the previous night , but this rendered spectra with small residual sky lines . to estimate the uncertainties introduced by this problem , the reduction was independently repeated by two of us ( jsa and jma ) . thus different spectral regions and interpolations were used to construct the flatfield and to subtract the sky background .",
    "the two reductions are in good agreement and provide consistent results .",
    "table  [ obs_summary ] contains the final physical parameters inferred from the two parallel reductions , and they agree to the point that their small differences do not affect the results in the work . seeing during observations was sub - arcsec .",
    "the not spectra have s / n similar to the int spectra ; the spectral resolution is slightly worse , and the angular resolution slightly better .    determining the actual spectral resolution is central for the proper interpretation of the observed linewidths . as usual , it was determined from the width of the telluric lines in the spectra since their intrinsic widths are just a few kms@xmath4 and thus negligible .",
    "gaussian functions were fitted to the lines , and their mean full width half maximum ( fwhm ) are quoted in table  [ logbook ] as the spectral resolution , with the error bars representing the rms fluctuations along the field of view .",
    "we average over all the targets observed with the same instrumental configuration to estimate the resolution corresponding to that particular configuration .",
    "the weighted average for the ids@int spectra turns out to be @xmath7  kms@xmath4 , whereas in the case of alfosc@not the measured resolution is @xmath8  kms@xmath4 .",

    "velocities , masses , abundances and other physical parameters are determined from the spectra .",

    "the curve is simple  @xmath16 yields a center for the rc , @xmath17 gives its amplitude ( @xmath18 when @xmath19 ) , and @xmath15 provides the spatial scale for the central gradient .",
    "we stress that the hypotheses behind the analytic expression  ( [ rc ] ) are of little importance in our context .",
    "the formula is used here because it provides a good representation of the observations , and so provides a smoothed version of the velocity curve .",
    "moreover , it allows us to determine the center of rotation @xmath16 .",
    "the center thus determined does not depend so much on the actual expression used to parameterize the rc , but on the fact that the curvature changes sign at the center of rotation , i.e. , @xmath20 with @xmath21 the second derivative of @xmath22 .",
    "this is a general property that any anti - symmetric rc satisfies .",
    "dynamical masses are estimated from rcs and linewidths . assuming the mass distribution to be spherically symmetric ( e.g. , a bulge or a dark matter halo ) , the circular velocity @xmath23 that balances the gravitational pull depends only on the mass enclosed within the radius @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 with @xmath27 the gravitational constant .",

    "the integration includes a 10  wide region around the peak emission , whereas the continuum was obtained by fitting a linear function to two continuum windows , 10 wide , outside the line .",
    "the h@xmath0 equivalent width ( ew ) is inferred from the h@xmath0 flux dividing by this continuum .",
