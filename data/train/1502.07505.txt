    "synthesis of diagnostic test accuracy studies is the most common medical application of multivariate meta - analysis @xcite .",
    "meta - analysis is broadly defined as the quantitative review of the results of related but independent studies @xcite .",
    "the purpose of a meta - analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies is to combine information over different studies , and provide an integrated analysis that will have more statistical power to detect an accurate diagnostic test than an analysis based on a single study .",
    "accurate diagnosis plays an important role in the disease control and prevention @xcite .",
    "diagnostic test accuracy studies observe the result of a gold standard procedure which defines the presence or absence of a decease and the result of a diagnostic test .",
    "they typically report the number of true positives ( diseased people correctly diagnosed ) , false positives ( non - diseased people incorrectly diagnosed as diseased ) , true negatives and false negatives . as the sensitivity ( proportion of those with the disease ) and specificity ( proportion of those without the disease ) are estimated from different samples in each study ( diseased and non - diseased patients ) , they can be assumed to be independent so that the within - study correlations are set to zero @xcite .",
    "however , there may be a negative between - studies association which should be accounted for .",
    "a negative association between these quantities across studies is likely because studies that adopt less stringent criterion for declaring a test positive invoke higher sensitivities and lower specificities @xcite .    in situations where studies compare a diagnostic test with its gold standard",
    ", heterogeneity arises between studies due to the differences in disease prevalence , study design as well as laboratory and other characteristics @xcite .",
    "because of this heterogeneity , a generalized linear mixed model ( glmm ) has been recommended in the biostatistics literature to synthesize information .",
    "note in passing that it is equivalent with the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model in rutter and gatsonis @xcite for the case without covariates .",
    "the glmm assumes independent binomial distributions for the true positives and true negatives , conditional on the latent pair of transformed ( via a link function ) sensitivity and specificity in each study .",
    "the random effects ( latent pair of transformed sensitivity and specificity ) are jointly analysed with a bivariate normal ( bvn ) distribution .",
    "chu _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite propose an alternative mixed model which operates on the original scale of sensitivity and specificity .",
    "the random effects follow the bivariate sarmanov s @xcite family of distributions with beta margins @xcite . however , this random effects distribution has a limited range of dependence and is inappropriate for general modelling unless the responses are weakly dependent .",
    "hence , this model is too restrictive in the context of diagnostic accuracy studies where strong ( negative ) dependence is likely .",
    "we propose a copula mixed model as an extension of the glmm and mixed model in chu _",
    "@xcite by rather using a copula representation of the random effects distribution with normal and beta margins , respectively .",
    "copulas are a useful way to model multivariate data as they account for the dependence structure and provide a flexible representation of the multivariate distribution .",
    "the theory and application of copulas have become important in finance , insurance and other areas , in order to deal with dependence in the joint tails . here , we indicate that this can also be important in meta - analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies .",
    "diagnostic test accuracy studies is a prime area of application for copula models , as the traditional assumption of multivariate normality is invalid in this context .",
    "a copula approach for meta - analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies was recently proposed by kuss _",
    "@xcite who explored the use of a copula model for observed discrete variables ( number of true positives and true negatives ) which have beta - binomial margins .",
    "this model is actually an approximation of a copula mixed model with beta margins for the latent pair of sensitivity and specificity .",
    "although , this approximation can only be used under the unrealistic case that the number of observations in the respective study group of healthy and diseased probands is the same for each study . in real data applications , the number of true positives and negatives do not have a common support over different studies , hence , one can not conclude that there is a copula .",
    "the natural replicability is in the random effects probability for sensitivity and specificity .    the remainder of the paper proceeds as follows .",
    "section [ stand - model - sec ] summarizes the standard glmm for synthesis of diagnostic test accuracy studies .",
    "section [ copula - mixed - model - sec ] has a brief overview of relevant copula theory and then introduces the copula mixed model for diagnostic test accuracy studies and discusses its relationship with existing mixed models .",
    "section [ sec - families ] discusses suitable parametric families of copulas for the copula mixed model , deduces summary receiver operating characteristic curves for the proposed model through quantile regression techniques and different characterizations of the bivariate random effects distribution , and demonstrates that they can show the effect of different model assumptions .",
    "section [ miss - section ] contains small - sample efficiency calculations to investigate the effect of misspecifying the random effects distribution on parameter estimators and standard errors and compare the proposed methodology to existing methods .",
    "section [ vuong - sec ] summarizes the assessment of the proposed models using the vuong s statistic @xcite , which is based on sample difference in kullback - leibler divergence between two models and can be used to differentiate two parametric models which could be non - nested .",
    "section [ sec - appl ] presents applications of our methodology to four data frames with diagnostic accuracy data from binary test outcomes .",
    "we conclude with some discussion in section [ sec - discussion ] , followed by a section with the software details and a technical appendix .",
    "we first introduce the notation used in this paper .",
    "the focus is on two - level ( within - study and between - studies ) cluster data .",
    "the data are are @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is an index for the within study measurements and @xmath2 is an index for the individual studies .",
    "the data , for study @xmath2 , can be summarized in a @xmath3 table with the number of true positives ( @xmath4 ) , true negatives ( @xmath5 ) , false negatives ( @xmath6 ) , and false positives ( @xmath7 ) ; see table [ 2times2 ] .",
    ".[2times2]data from an individual study in a @xmath3 table . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     for the khs log - likelihood we have the limit , @xmath8.\\ ] ] the limit of the khsmle ( as @xmath9 ) is the maximum of ( [ limitacd ] ) ; we denote this limit as @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath11 in ( [ limitacd ] ) are the model based probabilities and are computed to at least five significant digits using gauss - legendre quadrature with a sufficient number of quadrature points as described in subsection [ computation ] . for the log - likelihood in ( [ beta - mixed - cop - likelihood ] ) , we have the limit , @xmath12 the limit of the mle ( as @xmath9 ) is the maximum of ( [ limit ] ) ; we denote this limit as @xmath13 .",
    "representative results are shown in table [ kuss - asym ] for a bvn copula mixed model with beta margins , with mle results omitted because they were identical with the true values up to four or five decimal places .",
    "therefore , our method leads to unbiased estimating equations .",
    "regarding the khs method , conclusions from the values in the table and other computations that we have done are that for the khs method there is asymptotic bias ( decreases as @xmath14 increases ) for the univariate parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 as @xmath17 and @xmath18 increase , and substantial asymptotic downward bias for the dependence parameter @xmath18 ; note that this slightly decreases as @xmath14 increases .",
