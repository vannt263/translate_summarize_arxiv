    "over the past dozen years or so our knowledge of the neutrino sector has increased dramatically with the discovery of neutrino mass and mixing in atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations , followed by the observation of terrestrial neutrino oscillations in long baseline neutrino experiments which have confirmed and refined the earlier results @xcite . yet , despite this progress , which may even be termed a `` neutrino revolution '' , there are many questions about neutrinos which remain unanswered . perhaps the most pressing of these is the origin , nature and magnitude of neutrino mass , since neutrino oscillations only provide information about the squared mass differences between neutrino species which are independent of the absolute neutrino mass scale or the nature of the neutrino mass ( i.e. dirac or majorana ) . in the absence of any confirmed experimental signal from either beta decay end - point experiments or neutrinoless double beta decay experiments ,",
    "the most stringent limits on the absolute neutrino mass scale comes indirectly from cosmology where one typically obtains the limit on the absolute neutrino mass scale expressed in terms of the lightest neutrino mass as @xmath8 ev @xcite .",
    "thus , there remains the interesting possibility that neutrinos are quasi - degenerate , which one may roughly define as @xmath9 ev , where the lower limit is approximately set equal to the square root of the atmospheric neutrino mass squared difference .",
    "the current generation of running or planned neutrinoless double beta decay experiments are capable of discovering quasi - degenerate neutrinos , as defined above , within the next years .",
    "such a discovery would herald a new neutrino revolution to rival the last one , and would lead to an explosion of interest in theoretical models capable of accounting for quasi - degenerate neutrinos . in general",
    "having quasi - degenerate neutrinos does not lead to a sharp prediction for the neutrinoless double beta decay observable @xmath1 as a function of @xmath10 due to the presence of unknown phases in the neutrino mass matrix @xcite .",
    "the general conclusion that unknown phases enter the prediction for @xmath1 also remains valid in models which combine the experimental observation of ( at least approximate ) tri - bimaximal ( tb ) @xcite lepton mixing with the possibility of a quasi - degenerate neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "the reason is that the relevant phases entering @xmath1 are majorana phases .",
    "allowing for arbitrary majorana phases and considering a quasi - degenerate neutrino mass spectrum and tb mixing , @xmath1 can still be in the approximate interval @xmath11 $ ] .    what would we learn about the origin of neutrino mass from the discovery of quasi - degenerate neutrinos in neutrinoless double beta decay ?",
    "clearly this would imply that neutrinos are majorana , and possibly ( but not necessarily ) that would indicate that a seesaw mechanism is at work , but what kind of seesaw mechanism , i.e. is it type i or ii ? there are known examples of type i and type ii seesaw models which can lead to quasi - degenerate neutrinos as well as tb lepton mixing , so clearly quasi - degenerate neutrinos would not distinguish different types of seesaw mechanism .",
    "for example , the supersymmetric ( susy ) grand unified theory ( gut ) based on @xmath12 with family symmetry @xmath13 proposed in @xcite is based on the type ii seesaw mechanism and leads to tb mixing and allows quasi - degenerate neutrinos . on the other hand the susy @xmath2 model in @xcite based on the type i seesaw mechanism also leads to tb mixing and allows quasi - degenerate neutrinos .",
    "interestingly , the susy @xmath14 model with type i seesaw mechanism does not favour quasi - degenerate neutrinos @xcite , whereas a related model with a type ii seesaw mechanism does allow quasi - degenerate neutrinos @xcite .",
    "more generally , there is a huge literature on family symmetry models based on @xmath2 @xcite or other symmetries @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge , in all above examples , quasi - degenerate neutrinos are subject to the mentioned phase uncertainties in the prediction of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "it is interesting to ask , in what class of theories would we learn the most about the neutrino mass scale @xmath16 from the discovery of a measurement of @xmath1 in neutrinoless double beta decay ? clearly the answer would be those theories which predict @xmath1 uniquely as a function of @xmath16 without ambiguities from unknown phases , but the next question is do such theories exist ? perhaps surprisingly the answer is in the affirmative , and , even more surprisingly , the class of theories which have this property turn out to suggest the way that the neutrino mass matrix is generated , namely by a usual type i seesaw contribution with two or three right - handed neutrinos , plus an additional contribution proportional to the unit matrix . in @xcite , two of us proposed a class of theories of exactly this kind which we referred to as a `` type ii upgrade of type i seesaw models '' . in this class of models",
    "the additional contribution to the neutrino mass matrix was realised by an additional type ii seesaw .",
    "the type i seesaw part of the neutrino mass matrix , which controls the mass squared differences and mixing angles , was governed by sequential right - handed neutrino dominance @xcite .",
    "the effect of such an additional unit matrix structure implies that for quasi - degenerate neutrino masses the majorana cp phases are small and thus @xmath17 .",
    "although the class of models was specified , no realistic `` type ii upgrade '' model has ever been proposed .    in this paper",
    "we shall propose a model following the idea of an additional contribution the neutrino mass matrix proportional to the unit matrix based on @xmath2 family symmetry with @xmath18 grand unification .",
    "the model contains tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing after the @xmath2 family symmetry is broken as an indirect result of the assumed aligned `` neutrino flavons '' in the type i seesaw sector via constrained sequential dominance @xcite .",
    "these `` neutrino flavons '' break the @xmath2 symmetry , being assumed to be aligned along the columns of the tb mixing matrix , but quadratic combinations of the neutrino flavons respect accidentally the neutrino flavour symmetry as discussed in @xcite .",
    "further `` quark flavons '' are assumed to be misaligned compared to the `` neutrino flavons '' and are , together with the `` neutrino flavons '' , responsible for quark and charged lepton masses and quark mixings . as expected , due to a possibly large type ii seesaw contribution , or alternatively due to an additional type i seesaw contribution from an additional triplet representation of right - handed neutrinos , the model can naturally predict the neutrinoless double beta decay mass observable to be approximately equal to the neutrino mass scale .",
    "we also make a detailed fit to quark masses and mixing using the misaligned quark flavons and show that a simple ansatz for the phase of one of the misaligned quark flavons leads to successful quark cp violation . in order for radiative corrections not to modify too much the tb mixing for quasi - degenerate neutrinos @xcite , we shall restrict ourselves to low values of the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath19 . for such low @xmath20 ,",
    "a viable gut scale ratio of @xmath21 is achieved within susy @xmath18 guts using a clebsch factor of @xmath22 , as proposed recently by two of us in @xcite . for the third generation we use @xmath23-@xmath24 yukawa coupling unification @xmath25 at the gut scale which is viable for low @xmath26 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the layout of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the model . in section 3",
    "we perform a numerical fit to the quark and charged lepton masses and quark mixing angles and cp violating phase and discuss the neutrino masses and lepton mixing angles .",
    "section 4 summarises and concludes the paper . in appendix",
    "a we give a renormalisable superpotential and explicit expressions for the effective couplings and appendix b contains a possible vacuum alignment .",

    "we would like to remark that for smaller @xmath149 one can also naturally extend the model to hierarchical or inverted hierarchical neutrino masses without changing the leptonic mixing angles . with @xmath189 or @xmath190 or both we then also encounter cases where the majorana phases are close to @xmath191 . for a quasi - degenerate spectrum",
    "the model disfavours these unnatural cases since they would correspond to heavily fine - tuned parameters of the model .",
    "similarly , an inverse strongly hierarchical spectrum would require unnatural tuning between @xmath149 and @xmath192 to make @xmath193 very small .",
    "by contrast , for a typical parameter choice of the model , a normally ordered hierarchical spectrum simply corresponds to @xmath194 ,  @xmath195 and does not require any tuning at all .",
    "it is also interesting to note that with the phases in our model there is _ no _ possibility to have cancellations in eq .",
    "that could make @xmath1 vanish exactly . ev . ]",
    "neutrinoless double beta decay is thus , also for smaller @xmath149 , an unavoidable consequence in this class of models .",
    "we have proposed a model of quasi - degenerate neutrinos which predicts the neutrinoless double beta decay mass observable to be approximately equal to the neutrino mass scale @xmath16 , thereby allowing its determination approximately independently of unknown majorana phases . in general",
    "such quasi - degenerate neutrino masses may be naturally realised if there exists a non - abelian family symmetry with real triplet representations that enforces an additional contribution to the neutrino mass matrix proportional to the unit matrix , hence determining the neutrino mass scale . in our model ,",
    "the additional contribution was generated by a type ii seesaw , or , alternatively , by another type i seesaw contribution from an additional triplet representation of right - handed neutrinos ( or neutrino messenger fields ) .",
    "in addition , the standard type i seesaw contribution determines the neutrino mixing angles .",
    "although such a mechanism ( called a `` type ii upgrade '' in @xcite ) has been known for some time , the model in this paper is the first of its kind to combine this mechanism with tri - bimaximal mixing arising from @xmath2 family symmetry together with a @xmath18 susy gut .",
    "the susy @xmath0 model considered here has several attractive features .",
    "the full renormalisable superpotential for the coupling of matter to flavons , messenger fields and higgs fields is specified , and only discrete auxiliary symmetries are introduced , rather than the more common continuous abelian symmetry that is typically invoked in such models . in the considered model ,",
    "the neutrino mass scale can either originate from the induced vacuum expectation value of a @xmath196 triplet contained in a fifteen - dimensional representation of @xmath18 , or from an additional contribution to the neutrino mass operator induced by @xmath18 singlet messenger fields in the triplet representation of @xmath2 .",
    "since the type i seesaw contribution involves very hierarchical additional neutrino mass contributions , responsible for the tiny mass splittings between the quasi - degenerate neutrinos , we use the constrained sequential dominance mechanism which is well suited for achieving such strongly hierarchical contributions . in such a model the neutrino flavour symmetry associated with tri - bimaximal mixing is achieved indirectly from the family symmetry , given the assumed vacuum alignment .",
    "we have included renormalisation group corrections to the mixing angles and shown that they are under control for small values of @xmath26 in our framework and do not significantly modify the leptonic mixing angles .",
    "we have therefore considered small values of @xmath26 throughout our study .",
    "the model has several interesting phenomenological features which emerge from our numerical fit to the quark and lepton masses and quark mixing .",
    "in addition to @xmath23-@xmath24 unification that may be viable for small @xmath26 , the model realises the gut scale relation @xmath197 proposed in @xcite , which is favourable for small values of @xmath26 . in the quark sector",
    ", we observe that the correct @xmath126 ( corresponding to the right unitarity triangle with @xmath3 ) can be realised for the simple ansatz in eq .  .",
    "we remark that this simple ansatz leads to an interesting alternative texture ( different from @xcite ) that gives rise to a right - angled unitarity triangle with @xmath198 . for the leptonic mixing angles and cp phases",
    "we find @xmath168 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 and @xmath4 .",
    "the leptonic mixing angles satisfy the `` lepton mixing sum rule '' proposed in @xcite with only small theoretical errors since the 1 - 3 mixing in the charged lepton mass matrix is very small and the 2 - 3 mixing vanishes .",
    "the majorana cp phases are small for quasi - degenerate neutrino masses via a large additional contribution proportional to the unit matrix , as expected , and the model thus predicts the neutrinoless double beta decay mass observable to be approximately equal to the neutrino mass scale , or lightest neutrino mass , i.e.   @xmath201 .    in conclusion , if neutrinoless double beta decay were observed in the near future then this would herald another neutrino revolution in which neutrino masses would be quasi - degenerate . amongst the many possible models of quasi - degenerate neutrinos , the model with an additional contribution to neutrino mass matrix proportional to the unit matrix , as considered here , are distinguished by their prediction of that the neutrinoless double beta decay mass observable is approximately equal to the neutrino mass scale @xmath16 .",
    "we have proposed the first realistic model of this kind involving @xmath2 and susy @xmath18 guts . the @xmath2 family symmetry has the dual effect of enforcing on the one hand quasi - degeneracy via the additional unit matrix contribution to the neutrino mass matrix , and on the other hand tri - bimaximal mixing via the type i seesaw mechanism and constrained sequential dominance .",
    "a numerical fit to quark masses and mixing angles reveals that a simple ansatz describing quark cp violation with @xmath3 also leads to the leptonic phase @xmath4 . in such models the absolute neutrino masses could be directly measurable by experiment quite soon .",
