    "so there is a strong need for the efficient solutions of these shifted linear systems ( [ eq1.1 ] ) .",
    "since our non - hermitian coefficient matrices @xmath7 are large and sparse , it is remarkable that krylov subspace solvers are greatly appropriate tools , but it does not share the algorithm information during the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) with each scalar shift . denoting the @xmath8-dimensional krylov subspace with respects to @xmath9 and @xmath10 by @xmath11",
    "then in this case we can exploit the following well - known shift - invariance property of krylov subspaces @xcite @xmath12 this means that if we choose initial vectors @xmath13 properly ( for example , all initial guesses are zeros ) , once a basis has been constructed for one of these linear systems , it could also be reused for all other linear systems .",
    "therefore , there is no need to establish bases of all krylov subspaces @xmath14 separately , and thus the algorithmic cost required by the basis generation , in aspects of matrix - vector products , can be significantly reduced .",
    "this observation results in shifted krylov subspace methods for solving the shifted linear systems . in other words ,",
    "when one finds approximate solutions over krylov subspaces , one can save the cost of generating other @xmath15 krylov subspaces .",
    "this mechanism was shown to be very efficient @xcite .    in more recent years , various krylov subspace solvers for shifted non - hermitian linear systems",
    "were proposed in succession .",
    "more precisely , iterative solution techniques such as the shifted ( tf)qmr @xcite , the shifted bicgstab(@xmath16 ) @xcite , the restarted shifted fom @xcite and shifted idr(@xmath17)-type methods @xcite have been consecutively developed .",
    "it should be noted that methods based on the bi - lanczos process ( or the @xmath9-biorthogonalization process @xcite ) have also been developed for solving shifted non - hermitian linear systems .",
    "extensions of such methods , such as shifted bicg / bicgstab @xcite , shifted bicr / bicrstab @xcite , and shifted gpbicg , have been recently established in @xcite . additionally , both the recycling bicg method and the recycling bicgstab method were introduced and employed for handling shifted nonsymmetric linear systems arising from model reduction @xcite .",
    "these krylov subspace solvers based on bi - lanczos - like procedures are not emphases in this study , but these alternatives are still worth mentioning .",
    "on the other hand , we consider cmrh ( changing minimal residual method based on the hessenberg process @xcite ) , introduced in @xcite , is an interesting krylov subspace method for solving non - hermitian linear systems . moreover , the hessenberg procedure generally requires less operations and storage than the conventional arnoldi process @xcite and is thus attractive for producing a linear system solver , also refer to refs . @xcite and our recent work @xcite for a further discussion of these issues .",
    "in particular , when a large krylov subspace basis is required for convergence , the cmrh method is significantly faster than gmres in terms of execution time @xcite .",
    "some recent developments concerning the cmrh method and its practical applications can be found in @xcite .",
    "an implementation of cmrh that is suitable and preferable for parallel architectures is introduced in @xcite .",
    "as we already know , some efficient variants of the well - known gmres method @xcite have been proposed and improved for solving shifted nonsymmetric linear system , refer to @xcite for details .",
    "in addition , from the development of cmrh , the cmrh method often enjoys many similar computational properties of the gmres algorithm , see @xcite for this discussion .",
    "it also has been observed that in practice , cmrh behaves very much like gmres , in the sense that if gmres exhibits superlinear converges , so does cmrh for the same problem , and if gmres stagnates , cmrh does so as well .",
    "furthermore , the convergence curves for these two methods are always very near each other ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , and we note that cmrh can be implemented with fewer operations per iteration step than gmres . since the cmrh method is closely related to the gmres method and they are both the krylov subspace methods for nonsymmetric linear systems , so their elegant work gave us a simple and natural question : does there exist a variant of the cmrh method , which needs very cheap computational cost , for shifted linear systems ?",
    "our major contribution is to answer this question .",
    "the answer is _ yes _ , and it also needs to forced the shifted system residual to be colinear to the _ seed _ system residual , which modified the iterations for the shifted systems .",
    "the idea is based on the shift - invariance property of krylov subspaces as well . as a result ,",
    "a feature of the resulting algorithm is similar to the restarted shifted gmres method .    in practice ,",
    "preconditioning shifted systems ( [ eq1.1 ] ) is necessary to accelerate the convergence of shifted krylov subspace methods and this remains an open question , because standard preconditioning techniques may destroy the shift - invariance property ( [ eq1.2 ] ) ; see e.g. , @xcite for a discussion of these issues . in this work",
    ", we also construct an inner - outer iterative scheme based on nested krylov subspace methods , where the inner solver is a multi - shift krylov subspace method , such as shifted fom , shifted idr(@xmath17 ) , shifted qmridr(@xmath17 ) , or shifted bicgstab(@xmath16 ) methods , that acts as a preconditioner for an outer flexible cmrh ( fcmrh ) method @xcite .",
    "then we will do a comparative study of shifted krylov subspace methods for solving shifted linear systems ( [ eq1.1 ] ) , which are often from the recent hot topic : numerical solutions of pdes / fdes .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we briefly review the cmrh method and its relative remarks . in the next section",
    ", we discuss the shift - invariance property and then show how to generalize the cmrh method for solving the shifted linear systems .",
    "implementation details will be also described .",
    "then we also observe the framework of constructing suitable preconditioning techniques for the shifted cmrh method .",
    "section [ sec4 ] presents some numerical examples involving quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , pagerank and solving pdes / fdes application to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solvers . in section [ sec5 ] , the paper closes with some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , let us begin to recall some basic knowledge about the cmrh method .",
    "the mechanism of cmrh @xcite for the standard linear systems @xmath18 is to apply the hessenberg procedure with pivoting to construct a basis of the krylov subspace @xmath19 : @xmath20 , where we often define @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , i.e. , the first entry of @xmath23 .",
    "more precisely , the hessenberg process generates an @xmath24 unit lower trapezoidal matrix @xmath25 and a @xmath26 upper hessenberg matrix @xmath27 , such that @xmath28 thus , formally , the cmrh approximate solution @xmath29 is such that @xmath30 which deals with the following constrained problem @xmath31 since the columns of @xmath32 are not orthogonal , we can not compute directly @xmath33 such that the norm of the residual vector is minimized , i.e. , satisfy the eq .",
    "( [ eq1.4 ] ) . however , if we denote by @xmath34 the pseudo - inverse of @xmath32 , we can write an equivalent formulation for eq .",
    "( [ eq1.4 ] ) as follows @xmath35 in fact , any left inverse of @xmath32 will work here , but we use the pseudo - inverse for simplicity ; though see further comments in ( * ? ? ? * section 4 ) .",
    "thus , we can state equivalently that the cmrh approximate solution is @xmath36 , where @xmath33 solves @xmath37 i.e. , a quasi - residual is just minimized . this is similar to the well - known qmr method @xcite .",
    "alternatively we can observe this minimization , as a minimization of the residual using a semi - norm ; refer to @xcite . in terms of implementation",
    ", we write @xmath38 as @xmath39 , so that the cmrh approximation is @xmath40 , where @xmath41 solves @xmath42 and this is how cmrh is implemented , i.e. , solving the small least squares problem ( [ eq1.5 ] ) , refer to @xcite for details .",
    "similarly , although the cmrh method is less expensive and needs slightly less storage than the conventional gmres method per iteration , the number of vectors requiring storage increases as iteration count and hence the method must be restarted .",
    "the restarted version of the cmrh method will be dubbed cmrh(@xmath8 ) . for the sake of clarity , here we give the pseudo - code of the ( pivoted ) cmrh(@xmath8 ) method for solving nonsymmetric linear systems @xmath43 which is a modification of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* algorithm 3 ) and ( * ? ? ? * algorithm 2 ) .    choose the restarting frequency @xmath8 and the initial guess @xmath44 such that @xmath45 set @xmath46^t$ ] and determine @xmath47 such that @xmath48 set @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is used to swap contents .",

    "[ alg1 ]    finally , we need to mention that as is the case with qmr , cmrh is also a _ non - optimal method _ since the basis chosen for @xmath64 is not orthogonal .",
    "therefore the analysis and bounds in @xcite apply in particular to cmrh .",
    "more details of the theoretical analyses of the cmrh method , which we will not pursue them here , can be found in @xcite . without considering restarted strategy , sadok and",
    "szyld @xcite had stated that cmrh produces convergence curves which are very close to those of gmres , but using fewer operations and storage ; especially , they also presented new analysis which explains why cmrh has this good convergence behavior , see the following theorem .",

    "* theorem 4 ) and ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1 ) ) let @xmath65 and @xmath66 be the gmres and cmrh residuals at the @xmath8th iteration beginning with the same initial residual @xmath23 ( e.g. , @xmath67 ) , respectively . then @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the condition number of @xmath70 .",
    "[ thm1 ]    theorem [ thm1 ] helps us to understand how to describe the residual norms between cmrh and gmres iterations when the condition number of @xmath71 does not grow too fast .",
    "in addition , it is remarkable to mention that duintjer tebbens and meurant @xcite have recently further proved that any non - increasing residual norm history is possible for the cmrh method with any nonzero eigenvalues of the system matrix .",
    "in this section , firstly , we review the derivation and properties of the restarted shifted gmres solver , also we mention some further developments of the restarted shifted gmres method when it is employed to solve the shifted linear systems ( [ eq1.1 ] ) . secondly",
    ", according to the derivation of the restarted shifted gmres method , we can derive the shifted variant of the restarted cmrh method for solving the shifted linear systems ( [ eq1.1 ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , we also draw some conclusions about the restarted shifted cmrh method . at the end of this section",
    ", we will make some efforts on analyzing the algorithmic cost of the restarted shifted gmres and the restarted shifted cmrh method , respectively .",
    "firstly , we briefly recall the derivation of the restarted shifted gmres method introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . according to the shift - invariance property ( [ eq1.3 ] )",
    ", the shifted krylov subspace methods construct the krylov basis vectors for just one selected _ seed _ system .",
    "then the established basis can be reused for handling the rest systems dubbed the _",
    "add _ systems .",
    "let @xmath72 be the shift parameter for the seed system .",
    "we also choose the initial guesses @xmath73 such that the initial residuals @xmath74 are collinear : @xmath75 then , from the shift - invariance property ( [ eq1.3 ] ) , the approximate solutions @xmath76 for all @xmath77 are archived from affine spaces spanned by the initial guesses @xmath73 and the same krylov subspace as follows : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is an @xmath24 matrix whose columns are the basis vectors of krylov subspace @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .    due to this reusability of the basis @xmath79 , the shifted krylov subspace methods can handle the shifted linear systems ( [ eq1.1 ] ) at once without any additional matrix - vector products for _ add _ systems . in what follows ,",
    "we suppose that the shift parameter for the seed system is zero , i.e. @xmath82 .",
    "note that this assumption does not lose the generality , because if @xmath83 , then we can rewrite ( [ eq1.1 ] ) by @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "as a direct generalization of the gmres method to the shifted linear systems ( [ eq1.1 ] ) , the vectors @xmath86 of the shifted gmres method can be determined by the minimal residual condition as follows : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the upper hessenberg matrix obtained from the matrix formula of the arnoldi procedure , i.e. , @xmath89 and @xmath90^t\\in\\mathbb{r}^{m+1}$ ] .",
    "the shifted gmres method can find efficient solutions based on the minimum residual condition for all linear systems in ( [ eq1.1 ] ) with no additional matrix - vector products for the add systems .",
    "however , as noted in section [ sec1 ] , the shifted gmres method has difficulties due to the long - term vector recurrence based on the arnoldi procedure as well as the gmres method .",
    "therefore the restart is need to employ for the shifted gmres method .",
    "unfortunately , it is known that the residual vectors @xmath91 obtained from the minimum residual condition are not collinear in general .",
    "thus after restart , the shift - invariance property ( [ eq1.3 ] ) will be unavailable for solving shifted linear systems . to remedy this difficulty , frommer and glssner proposed in 1998 the restarted shifted gmres method @xcite , which is to impose the collinearity condition : @xmath92 instead of the minimum residual condition for add systems , where @xmath93 is the residual vector of the seed system and @xmath8 is the restart frequency .",
    "we note that , for the seed system , the restarted shifted gmres method enforces the minimum residual condition on the residual vector like the shifted gmres method .    for the seed system",
    ", the vector @xmath94 is evaluated by solving the following minimization problem : @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "the residual vector @xmath97 can be written as @xmath98 thus , from the collinearity condition ( [ eq1.8 ] ) for the add systems , it follows @xmath99 via matrix identities of the well - known arnoldi procedure ; refer to @xcite for details .    from the above relation , @xmath100 and @xmath101",
    "can be read as the solution of the @xmath102 linear systems , i.e. , @xmath103 for @xmath104 . the linear systems ( [ eq1.9 ] ) are solved efficiently via using the givens - rotation , because coefficient matrices of linear systems ( [ eq1.9 ] ) have upper hessenberg forms .",
    "in addition , the practical implementation of the restarted shifted gmres method can be found in ( * ? ? ?",

    "[ lem1 ]    if the coefficient matrix @xmath9 is positive definite , i.e. , @xmath109 and @xmath110 0 for all @xmath77 , then the restarted shifted gmres method converges for both seed and add systems for every restart frequency @xmath8 , because in this case eq . ( [ eq1.9 ] ) has a unique solution ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.3 ) .",
    "moreover if the smallest @xmath111 is chosen as the seed shift , and the initial guesses @xmath73 of the first restart cycle are set at @xmath112 , then the add systems converge more rapidly than the seed system ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.3 ) . therefore in this case",
    ", we do not need to use the shift switching technique .",
    "in general , the seed system may converge faster than the add systems . in this case , for robust computation , we need to change the seed into one of the rest systems , this strategy is called the _ seed switching technique _ @xcite .",
    "as previously mentioned , the restarted cmrh method is a _ non - optimal _ krylov subspace method , but it has some numerical advantages with compared to the restarted gmres method . in addition , the cmrh method is established by using the _ non - orthogonal _ basis of krylov subspace @xmath113 . from the theoretical study and development of practice ,",
    "many literatures have proved that the cmrh method is very close to the gmres method and the qmr method ; see @xcite for details .",
    "in fact , the derived process of the qmridr(@xmath17 ) method , which also belongs to the _ non - optimal _ krylov subspace methods , is similar to the cmrh method .",
    "then as we know , the shifted variants of gmres , qmr and qmridr(@xmath17 ) have been successfully established in recent years , see @xcite , respectively .",
    "moreover , inspect the derivations of these mentioned shifted variants , it can find that the orthogonality of the krylov subspace basis is not essential to construct the shifted variants for solving eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is natural to develop the shifted variant of cmrh for solving eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) with the help of deriving strategies for the shifted gmres method and the cmrh method .",

    "so it motivates us to extend the cmrh(@xmath8 ) method for solving shifted linear systems by using the similar derivation of restarted shifted gmres method .",

    "then we consider the numerical advantages of shifted hessenberg method and shifted cmrh method , then the new nested iterative framework of shifted linear systems is proposed based on the hessenberg procedure . more precisely , we proposed three nested iterative solvers : ` hessen - fcmrh ` , ` hessen - fgmres ` and ` fom - fcmrh ` for shifted linear systems .",
    "the fist two ones often significantly reduce the cpu time elapsed with compared to the ` fom - fgmres ` introduced in @xcite .",
    "especially , numerical experiments involving the time integration scheme for 3d fractional / partial differential equations are reported to illustrate the advantages of the proposed nested iterative solvers .",
    "these approaches can be very beneficial for an important application in the numerical scheme with evaluating matrix function ( see e.g. @xcite ) for three - dimensional time dependent ( fractional ) convection - diffusion - reaction equations .",
    "this point can be regarded as the second contribution of our manuscript .",
    "in addition , we note that the number of iterations of inner solver are often large , it means that we need more computational memory and time in the whole algorithmic procedure .",
    "as an outlook for the future , the shifted krylov subspace solvers with short - term recurrence , such as shifted bicgstab(@xmath16 ) , shifted bicrstab , shifted idr(@xmath17 ) , shifted gpbicg , shifted tfqmr and shifted qmridr(@xmath17 ) , can be used as the inner solvers in the nested iterative framework for shifted linear systems , see e.g. @xcite . meanwhile",
    ", the restarted techniques often can remedy the issue about linearly increasing memory during the iteration procedure of long - term recurrence krylov subspace methods , e.g. , fom , gmres , and cmrh .",
    "so we also will focus on developing the restarted shifted versions of fom , gmres , hessenberg , and cmrh as the inner solver .",

    "<S> , we derive the variants of restarted cmrh ( changing minimal residual method based on the hessenberg process ) , in which the hessenberg process is always cheaper than the conventional arnoldi procedure , for solving such sequence of shifted linear systems . in order to accelerate the iterative solvers </S>",
    "<S> , we also present both methods inside of a general framework which allows these techniques to be extended to the setting of flexible preconditioning and inexact krylov subspace methods . </S>",
    "<S> finally , extensive numerical experiments involving the numerical solutions of pdes / fdes and pagerank problems are reported to illustrate the performance of these proposed methods , also against other popular multi - shifted krylov subspace methods .    </S>",
