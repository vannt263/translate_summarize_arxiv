    "hypernuclear physics has received a lot of attention since the early emulsion and bubble chamber experiments @xcite aimed at establishing how the presence of a new flavor ( strangeness ) broadens the knowledge achieved by the conventional field of nuclear physics and helps in understanding the breaking of su(3 ) symmetry . although major achievements in hypernuclear physics have been taken at a very slow pace due to limited statistics , the in  flight @xmath5 counter experiments carried out at cern @xcite and brookhaven @xcite revealed a considerable amount of hypernuclear features , such as small spin  orbit strength , increased validity of single  particle motion of the @xmath0 , narrow widths of @xmath6hypernuclei , etc , injecting a renewed interest in the field . since then , the experimental facilities have been upgraded and experiments using the @xmath7 and @xmath8 reactions are being conducted at the brookhaven ags and kek accelerators with higher beam intensities and improved energy resolution . moreover",
    ", the photo and electro  production of strangeness will be studied at cebaf @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the new improved experimental data will bring the field of hypernuclear physics to a stage in which major advances can be made .    from the theoretical side ,",
    "one of the goals of hypernuclear research is to relate the hypernuclear observables to the bare hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath9 ) interaction .",
    "the experimental difficulties associated to the short lifetime of hyperons and low intensity beam fluxes have limited the number of @xmath10 and @xmath11 scattering events to less than one thousand @xcite , not being enough to fully constrain the @xmath9 interaction . at present , there are two meson - exchange @xmath9 potentials : that of the nijmegen group @xcite , where the corresponding baryon ",
    "baryon - meson vertices are subject to strict su(3 ) symmetry , and that of the jlich group @xcite , which assumes a stronger su(6 ) symmetry and therefore all the coupling constants at the strange vertices can be related to the @xmath12 coupling constants .",
    "although both models are able to describe the @xmath9 scattering data , their spin  isospin structure is very different .",
    "therefore , more data on @xmath9 scattering , especially the measurement of spin observables , are highly desirable . in the lack of such data",
    ", alternative information can be obtained from the study of hypernuclei .",
    "one possibility is to focus on light hypernuclei , such as @xmath13he , @xmath13h and @xmath14he , which can be treated `` exactly '' solving 3-body faddeev @xcite and 4-body yakubovsky @xcite equations .",
    "however , the power of these techniques is limited by the scarce amount of spectroscopic data . only the ground state energies and a particle  stable excited state for each a=4 species can be used to put further constraints on the @xmath9 interaction .",
    "another possibility is the study of hypernuclei with larger masses .",
    "they can be reasonably well described by a shell  model picture and , on the other hand , provide a substantial amount of hypernuclear excited states .",
    "obtaining spectroscopic data at high resolution is one of the ultimate goals of the hypernuclear program at cebaf .",
    "hypernuclear structure calculations must be performed with an effective @xmath9 interaction ( @xmath15matrix ) obtained from the free @xmath9 potential by solving a bethe  goldstone equation .",
    "the comparison with data will help to elucidate which pieces of of the bare @xmath9 potential need to be changed for a better agreement with experiment .",
    "some shell  model calculations have already been performed using a nuclear matter @xmath9",
    "@xmath15matrix @xcite or a @xmath15matrix calculated directly in finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that the various potentials predict a quite different positioning of the excited energy levels , showing the suitability of this approach as a tool to constrain the @xmath9 interaction .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the self - energy of the @xmath0 in @xmath16o using a microscopic many  body approach .",
    "our starting point is a nuclear matter @xmath15matrix at a fixed energy and density , which is used to calculate the @xmath15matrix for the finite nucleus including corrections up to second order .",
    "this second  order correction , which assumes harmonic oscillator states for the occupied ( hole ) states and plane waves for the intermediate unbound particle states , incorporates the correct energy and density dependence of the @xmath15matrix .",

    "@xcite take the nuclear matter @xmath15matrix at the fermi momentum @xmath17 ( density ) that reproduces the binding energy of the @xmath0 in the hypernucleus under study .",
    "our second order finite nucleus calculation eliminates the need to choose such an effective fermi momentum for each single - particle state and hypernucleus . in this sense",
    "it is comparable with the finite nucleus calculations of refs . @xcite and @xcite .    using this @xmath15matrix",
    "we determine a self  energy for the @xmath0 , which is non  local and depends on the energy of the hyperon . solving the schrdinger equation with this self ",
    "energy we are able to determine the single particle energies and wave functions of the bound hyperon .",
    "our approach also provides automatically the real and imaginary part of the hyperon optical potential at positive energies and , therefore , allows to study the hyperon ",
    "nucleus scattering properties .",
    "because of the large momentum transfer , the @xmath18 reaction at cebaf @xcite and @xmath7 reaction at kek @xcite give rise to a significant quasifree production , i.e.  hyperons in the continuum .",
    "the hyperon may then scatter from nucleons or nuclei composing the target material .",
    "it is then clear that , in order to analyze such data , a knowledge of the hyperon ",

    "our results are presented in section 3 with a special emphasis on the discussion of the non - locality and energy - dependence of the @xmath0 self  energy .",

    "this is done following the local density approximation for the orthogonalization of the intermediate nucleon particle states of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the contributions to the real part of the self - energy from eq.([eq:2p1h ] ) can be obtained through the following dispersion relation @xmath71 where @xmath72 means a principal value integral .",
    "since @xmath73 is different from zero only for positive values of @xmath74 and its diagonal matrix elements are negative , this dispersion relation implies that the diagonal elements of @xmath75 will be attractive for negative values of @xmath67 .",
    "this attraction should increase for small positive energies .",
    "it will eventually decrease and become repulsive only for large positive values of the energy of the interacting @xmath0 .",

    "( [ eq : self_ener ] ) can be used as a single  particle potential in a schrdinger equation in order to investigate bound and scattering states of a @xmath0 in a finite nucleus .",
    "the different approximations to the self  energy , i.e.  whether we include the @xmath65 contribution or not , results in different single  particle hamiltonians .",
    "the schrdinger equation is solved by diagonalizing the corresponding single ",

    "( [ eq : basis ] ) are orthogonal and normalized within the box .",
    "the single particle hamiltonian for the @xmath0 , consisting out of the kinetic energy and the real part of the self  energy can be evaluated in this basis and the resulting eigenvalue problem @xmath89 restricted typically to @xmath90 or @xmath91 states , can be easily solved . notice that a self  consistent process is performed for each eigenvalue , i.e. the self  energy needs to be evaluated at the energy of the resulting eigenvalue . as a first result , one obtains the negative energies for the bound states and the corresponding wave functions , which are expressed in terms of expansion coefficients for the basis defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : basis ] ) . furthermore , one also obtains discrete positive energies that correspond to scattering states with radial wave functions which are zero at @xmath92 . taking into account this fact it is straightforward to evaluate the phase shifts for those energies .",
    "phase shifts for different energies can be obtained by varying @xmath80 , see e.g.  the discussion in ref .",
    "the results presented in this section have been obtained with two potential models for the free @xmath9interaction @xmath27 , namely the nijmegen soft  core potential described in ref .",
    "@xcite and the energy independent version with parameter set b of the jlich group @xcite .",
    "both potential models are based on meson  exchange theory and include the relevant low  energy mesons . however , contrary to what is the case for the nucleon  nucleon potential , not all parameters which enter the definition of the various potential models , like coupling constants , are left as free parameters to be constrained by the data .",
    "the nijmegen model imposes su(3 ) symmetry on the coupling constants leaving the pseudoscalar @xmath93 ratio @xmath51 as a free parameter adjusted to fit the data ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "instead , the jlich model fixes its value to @xmath95 by imposing the stronger su(6 ) symmetry .",
    "thus , various potential models may give different results for various observables .",
    "as an example , we show in table [ tab : tab1 ] the binding energy of the @xmath0 at rest in nuclear matter at saturation density ( @xmath96 @xmath41 ) .",
    "these results were obtained using a starting energy @xmath97 mev , which is approximately the sum of the single  particle energies of an average nucleon and a @xmath0 in nuclear matter , and with the center  of  mass momentum of the @xmath9 pair at rest .",
    "we employ kinetic energies for the single  particle spectrum above the fermi momentum .",
    "the numbers displayed in table [ tab : tab1 ] compare well with the nuclear matter calculations of reuber _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and yamamoto _ et al .  _",
    "one can see that the nijmegen potential predicts a binding energy for the @xmath0 ( 24.35 mev ) , which is about 7 mev weaker than the prediction of the jlich model ( 31.48 mev ) .",
    "even larger differences are observed if one inspects the contributions of the various partial waves . while for the case of the jlich potential the predominant contribution to the binding energy results from the @xmath98@xmath99 coupled channel , the largest term for the nijmegen potential is obtained in the @xmath100 channel . in both interaction models",
    "a large part of the @xmath0 binding energy is due to the coupling of the @xmath10 to the @xmath11 channel .",
    "neglecting this coupling ( numbers listed in parenthesis ) would result in unbound @xmath0 in the case of the nijmegen potential .",
    "the main purpose of this work , however , is to study the @xmath0 self  energy in @xmath16o as well as the single  particle properties that can be derived from it .",
    "here we restrict our attention to the states with orbital angular momentum @xmath101 .",
    "unless the comparison turns to be of interest , we will present results for the jlich interaction only , since it yields the correct @xmath0 binding energy in nuclear matter as obtained when extrapolating from @xmath102 to finite hypernuclei data @xcite .",
    "we first investigate the properties of the known bound state of an s  wave @xmath0 in @xmath16o . in table",
    "[ tab : tab2 ] we display the binding energy , kinetic energy and root ",
    "mean  square radius of the @xmath0 obtained by solving the schrdinger equation for two different choices of the self  energy . as can be seen from this table ,",
    "both potentials give a bound state already at the hartree  fock level .",
    "recall , however , that the label hartree ",
    "fock approximation here refers to a calculation in terms of the nuclear matter @xmath15matrix .",
    "similar to the case of nuclear matter the nijmegen potential yields smaller binding energies than the jlich model also for the finite system .",
    "this smaller binding energy predicted by the nijmegen potential also results in a larger radius for the bound @xmath0 state and a smaller binding energy .",
    "this feature can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , where we plot the corresponding @xmath0 wave functions . for the sake of comparison",
    "we also plot the wave function of a @xmath103 nucleon in @xmath69o taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the second  order correction introduces additional attraction , which can be understood from the following argument : the total @xmath65 contribution is given by @xmath75 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : disprel ] ) , minus the nuclear matter correction term @xmath104 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vc ] ) .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ eq : realv ] ) introduces the finite nucleus pauli operator which is less restrictive than the nuclear matter pauli operator at @xmath96 @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , by allowing for a larger phase space in the sum over intermediate states , the finite nucleus second  order contribution is more attractive than the corresponding nuclear matter result , producing an overall attractive second  order correction .",
    "it is important to note that the final result ( @xmath105 ) is stable with respect to the use of different starting energies in the @xmath15matrix . in other words , had we used a different value for the starting energy , @xmath28 , the @xmath106 contribution to the @xmath0 single  particle energy would have had a different value .",
    "however , the @xmath65 contribution would have also been different producing approximately the same final results as shown in table [ tab : tab2 ] .",

    "local self  energy obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : self_ener ] ) can be represented by a local potential .",
    "we start by analyzing the hartree  fock contribution , which does not contain any explicit dependence on the energy of the incoming @xmath0 . in this approximation",
    "the non  locality arises to some extent from the non  local @xmath15 interaction but mainly from the fock exchange term displayed in fig .",

    "particle @xmath0 properties ( single  particle energy , wave functions , optical potential ) are sensitive to the particular model .",
    "this is especially relevant at present for the analysis of the high resolution hypernuclear spectroscopy experiments which are going to be conducted at cebaf .",
    "in this work we have calculated the self  energy of a @xmath0 in the finite nucleus @xmath16o using a microscopic many  body approach which allows to study the energy dependence as well as the momentum dependence of the self  energy for a finite nucleus , starting with realistic modern potential models for the hyperon ",

    "interaction we have used the meson  exchange models of the nijmegen @xcite and jlich groups @xcite . the jlich potential yields a more attractive @xmath0 single  particle energy in nuclear matter than the nijmegen potential .",
    "the same qualitative pattern is repeated in the finite nucleus calculation , where the single  particle energy for a @xmath0 in the @xmath103 state in @xmath16o is @xmath140 mev and @xmath141 mev with jlich and nijmegen potentials , respectively . the experimental estimate from ref .",

    "energy is in turn used to derive an optical potential for the @xmath0nucleus system .",
    "it turns out that the real and imaginary parts of our non - local optical potential can easily be approximated by the shape of a woods  saxon potential with a depth depending on energy .",
    "this local equivalent potential is less attractive than those derived from the local  density calculation of ref .   @xcite .",
