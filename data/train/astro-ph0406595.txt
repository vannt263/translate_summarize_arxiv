    "electron magnetohydrodynamics ( emhd ) deals with mhd phenomena occurring at scales smaller than those of conventional mhd ( see kingsep , chukbar , & yankov 1990 ) . on scales below the ion inertial length @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the speed of light and @xmath6 is the ion plasma frequency , we can assume that the ions create only smooth motionless background and fast electron flows carry all the current , so that @xmath7 when we ignore the ambipolar diffusion , the ohm s law becomes @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the plasma resistivity . inserting this into faraday s induction law ( @xmath10 ) , we obtain the emhd equation @xmath11 + \\eta \\nabla^{2 } { \\bf b}.\\ ] ] note that , in this paper , we only consider the zero ( normalized ) electron inertial length case : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the electron plasma frequency and @xmath14 is the typical size of the system .",
    "emhd turbulence ( also known as whistler turbulence ) can be viewed as a generalized alfvenic turbulence on scales smaller than the proton larmor radius ( quataert & gruzinov 1999 ) .",
    "emhd turbulence plays important roles in neutron stars and accretion disks .",
    "goldreich & reisenegger ( 1992 ) discussed the properties of emhd turbulence and argued that emhd turbulence can enhance ohmic dissipation of magnetic field in isolated neutron stars ( see also cumming , arras , & zweibel 2004 ) .",
    "quataert & gruzinov ( 1999 ) discussed transition from conventional alfvenic mhd cascade to emhd cascade in advection dominated accretion flows ( adaf ) .",
    "other applications of the emhd model include quasi - collisionless magnetic reconnection in laboratory and space plasmas ( bulanov , pegoraro , & sakharov 1992 ; biskamp , schwarz , & drake 1995 ; avinash et al .",
    "1998 ) and plasma opening switches and z pinches ( see kingsep et al . 1990 ) .",
    "earlier researchers convincingly showed that energy spectrum of emhd turbulence is steeper than kolmogorov s @xmath15 spectrum . using two - dimensional ( 2d ) numerical simulations , biskamp , schwarz , & drake ( 1996 ) found that energy spectrum follows @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "they showed that the following kolmogorov - type argument can explain this spectrum .",
    "suppose that the eddy interaction time for eddies of size @xmath18 is the usual eddy turnover time @xmath19 .",
    "since @xmath20 ( equation ( [ eq1 ] ) ) , this becomes @xmath21 . combining this with the constancy of spectral energy cascade rate ( @xmath22=constant ) , one obtains @xmath23 .",
    "note that @xmath24 and @xmath25 are related by @xmath26 .",
    "biskamp et al .",
    "( 1999 ) also obtained a similar result for 3d .",
    "ng et al . ( 2003 ) confirmed the 2d result of biskamp et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . therefore , earlier works strongly support that @xmath27 for both 2d and 3d .",
    "recently , galtier & bhattacharjee ( 2003 ) studied energy spectrum of _ weak _ whistler turbulence .",
    "dastgeer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , ng et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and dastgeer & zank ( 2003 ) numerically studied anisotropy of 2d emhd turbulence .",
    "no 3d study has been reported yet . in this paper , we study anisotropy of 3d emhd turbulence .",
    "* method.* we have calculated the time evolution of decaying 3d incompressible electron magnetohydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "we have adopted a pseudospectral code to solve the normalized incompressible emhd equation in a periodic box of size @xmath28 : @xmath29       + \\eta^{\\prime } \\nabla^{2 } { \\bf b } ,       \\label{beq}\\ ] ] where magnetic field , time , and length are normalized by a mean field @xmath30 , the whistler time @xmath31 ( @xmath32= electron gyro frequency ) , and a characteristic length scale @xmath14 ( see , for example , galtier & bhattacharjee 2003 ) .",
    "the resistivity @xmath33 in equation ( [ beq ] ) is dimensionless .",
    "the dispersion relation of a whistler waves in this normalized units is @xmath34 , where @xmath2 is the wave number parallel to the ( local ) mean magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field consists of the uniform background field and a fluctuating field : @xmath35 .",
    "the strength of the uniform background field , @xmath30 , is set to 1 .",
    "we use @xmath36 collocation points . at @xmath37 , the random magnetic field",
    "is restricted to the range @xmath38 in wavevector ( * k * ) space .",
    "the amplitudes of the random magnetic field at @xmath37 is @xmath39 .",
    "hyperdiffusivity is used for the diffusion terms .",
    "the power of hyperdiffusivity is set to 3 , so that the dissipation term in the above equation is replaced with @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is approximately @xmath42 .",
    "* spectrum.*figure  [ fig_sp ] shows energy spectra . at @xmath37 only large scale ( i.e. small @xmath43 )",
    "fourier modes are excited .",
    "the dotted curve in figure  [ fig_sp ] shows the initial spectrum .",
    "as the turbulence decays , the initial energy cascades down to small scales and , as a result , small scale ( i.e. large @xmath43 ) modes are excited .",
    "when the energy reaches the dissipation scale at @xmath44 , the energy spectrum decreases without changing its slope ( the dashed and the solid curves ) .",
    "the slope at this stage is around @xmath45 , which is very close to the predicted spectrum : @xmath46 however , we also note that our result is compatible with a @xmath47 spectrum .",
    "the energy spectra confirm that the kolmogorov - type energy cascade model with @xmath48 works fine for emhd turbulence . here",
    "we show that timescale of motion also supports the energy cascade model .",
    "symbolically , we can rewrite the emhd equation in wave - vector space as follows : @xmath49 , where @xmath50 represents the nonlinear term .",
    "we have ignored the dissipation term . naively speaking ,",
    "we might obtain the time scale by dividing @xmath51 by @xmath52 .",
    "however , to remove the effect of large scale translational motions , we restrict the evaluation of the nonlinear terms to contributions coming from the interactions between the mode at @xmath43 and other modes within the range of @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( see cho , lazarian , & vishniac ( 2002a ) for details ) . we show the result in figure 1(b ) .",
    "our result seems to follow the timescale @xmath55     since @xmath56 , we can obtain the average parallel wavenumber @xmath57 from @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the strength of the random magnetic field .",
    "the quantity @xmath60 is roughly the average parallel size of eddies at the energy injection scale .",
    "we can easily extend this method to smaller scale eddies . consider eddies of perpendicular size @xmath18 . since it is reasonable to assume that the eddies are stretched along the _ local _ mean magnetic field , the quantity @xmath61 , not @xmath62 , is proportional to @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the local mean field , @xmath65 the fluctuating field at scale @xmath18 , and @xmath2 the wave number parallel to the local mean magnetic field ( cho , lazarian , & vishniac 2002b ) .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath66 .",
    "it is convenient to do the calculation in fourier space : @xmath67 where @xmath3 ( @xmath68 when anisotropy is present ) is the wave number perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field and @xmath64 is the local mean field obtained by eliminating modes whose perpendicular wavenumber is greater than @xmath53 ( @xmath69 ) . the fluctuating field @xmath65 is obtained by eliminating modes whose perpendicular wavenumber is less than @xmath53 .",
    "we plot the result in figure 1(c ) .",
    "the result does not show a well - defined power law between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "however , the result is roughly compatible with @xmath70 we believe this is the true anisotropy of emhd turbulence .",
    "we may use the second order structure function to illustrate scale - dependent anisotropy of eddy structures ( see cho & vishniac 2000 ) .",
    "we calculate the second order structure function in a local frame , which is aligned with local mean magnetic field @xmath71 : @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are unit vectors parallel and perpendicular to the local mean field @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "see cho et al .",
    "( 2002a ) and cho & vishniac ( 2000 ) for the detailed discussion of the local frame .",
    "we show the resulting structure function in figure 2 .     at @xmath76 , where @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) is distance along ( perpendicular to )",
    "the @xmath79 mean field , shows existence of scale - dependent anisotropy : smaller eddies are more elongated .",
    "although this plot is useful to illustrate scale - dependent anisotropy , we do not use this plot to study anisotropy ( see text ) . ]",
    "we may obtain anisotropy of eddy structures by analyzing the contour shapes .",
    "however , we believe that this method will not give the true anisotropy for emhd . the reason is as follows . roughly speaking ,",
    "when energy spectrum is steeper than @xmath80 we should not use the method .",
    "when energy spectrum is steeper than @xmath80 , small scale fluctuations are so small that the calculation of the second - order structure function will be dominated by the smooth change of the large scale field and the second - order structure function will show @xmath81-scaling regardless of the true scaling : @xmath82 when @xmath83 . in the perpendicular direction , @xmath84 and ,",
    "therefore , it is fine to use the structure function .",
    "however , we should not use the method for the _ parallel _ direction when anisotropy is stronger than @xmath85 .",
    "suppose anisotropy scales with @xmath86 .",
    "then the 3d energy spectrum is @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is a function that describes distribution of energy along the @xmath2 direction in fourier space ( see goldreich & sridhar 1995 ; cho et al .",
    "2002a ) . the 1d energy spectrum for the _ parallel _ direction becomes @xmath89 ( cho et al .",
    "therefore , when @xmath90 , @xmath91 is steeper than @xmath92 and , thus , we can not use the structure function to study anisotropy . in other words , even if @xmath90 , the structure function method will give a wrong result that @xmath93 .",
    "the degree of bending of magnetic field lines depends on the @xmath94 ratio .",
    "when we assume that @xmath95 and @xmath96 represent typical perpendicular and parallel size of eddies at the scale @xmath18 ( @xmath97 ) , we obtain @xmath98 and , thus , @xmath99 , we use @xmath100 and @xmath101 . ]",
    "we obtained @xmath102 in the previous section .",
    "see equation ( [ eq_ani_2 ] ) . here",
    "we discuss why this is reasonable .",
    "first , the fact that the kolmogorov - type argument works fine for the energy spectrum implies the @xmath102 anisotropy . as we mentioned earlier , biskamp et al .",
    "( 1996 ) assumed that the cascade time ( @xmath103 ) is the eddy turnover time ( @xmath104 ) and obtained @xmath23 , which agrees well with numerical simulations .",
    "see also our calculation of timescale in figure 1(b ) . we can show that , when @xmath105 , there is balance between the eddy turnover time @xmath106 and the the whistler time @xmath107 ( = the linear wave period=@xmath108 ) .",
    "suppose that we have a wave packet whose parallel size is @xmath109 and perpendicular size @xmath110 ( @xmath111 when anisotropy is present ) .",
    "this wave packet travels along the magnetic field line at the speed of @xmath112 . when this wave packet collides with opposite - traveling wave packets ( of similar size )",
    ", the change of energy per collision is @xmath113 , where we used equation ( [ beq ] ) to estimate @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , @xmath115 if @xmath116 , then many collisions are required to make @xmath117",
    ". these collisions are incoherent",
    ". then @xmath118 collisions are necessary to complete the cascade .",
    "this means that the energy cascade time by collision is @xmath119 if @xmath120 , this equation implies @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath122 , the turbulence is strong ( i.e. @xmath123 ) by definition and , therefore , energy cascade occurs during one wave period , which is equal to @xmath106 ( see equation ( [ eq_dee ] ) ) .",
    "thus , one can show that three expressions , _ kolmogorov - type scaling for cascade time _ ( @xmath48 ) , _ critical balance _ ( @xmath124 ) , and _ strong turbulence _ ( @xmath123 ) , are all equivalent ( c. thompson , private communication ) , as in _ ordinary _ mhd turbulence .",
    "see goldreich & sridhar ( 1995 ) for the original discussion of the critical balance and anisotropy of _ ordinary _ mhd turbulence . ] and there is a balance between @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "our results clearly show that the critical balance factor @xmath127 is constant ( note that @xmath100 and @xmath128 ) . using @xmath129",
    ", we obtain @xmath102 .",
    "the uncertainty relation is another way to express this balance .",
    "the usual uncertainty relation between time and energy ( @xmath130frequency ) is @xmath131 .",
    "since @xmath132 and @xmath133 , we obtain the same anisotropy scaling .",
    "second , a simple geometric argument in fig .",
    "[ fig_geo ] suggests the @xmath102 anisotropy .",
    "suppose that fig .",
    "[ fig_geo ] shows a typical shape of magnetic field lines at scale @xmath18 .",
    "then , we can assume that @xmath134 , where @xmath25 is the fluctuating field at the scale @xmath18 and @xmath135 is the local mean field ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "if we assume @xmath95 and @xmath96 represent typical shape of eddies at the scale @xmath18 ( @xmath97 ) , we have @xmath137 in this interpretation , smaller eddies are more elongated because they have a smaller @xmath138 ratio .",
    "note that the relation in equation ( [ eq : geo ] ) is in fact equivalent to the strong turbulence condition ( @xmath123 ; see equation ( [ eq_dee ] ) ) , which means energy cascade occurs over one wave period . from equation ( [ eq_dee ] ) , we can show that @xmath139 . combining this with the constancy of spectral energy cascade rate ( @xmath140=constant )",
    ", we obtain @xmath141 and , thus , the @xmath102 anisotropy .",
    "one peculiar feature of emhd cascade is that there is balance between parallel and perpendicular cascade by self - interaction .",
    "the resonance relations of whistler turbulence , @xmath142 allow self - interaction .",
    "we can show that the parallel cascade by self interaction is as fast as the perpendicular cascade when @xmath102 .",
    "ng et al . ( 2003 ) performed a numerical experiment and found that cascade by self - interaction is as fast as that by collision with opposite - traveling wave packets .",
    "combined together , these facts imply that anisotropy can not be stronger than @xmath102 in emhd .",
    "we will discuss this in detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we have focused on anisotropy of 3d emhd turbulence . however , it is fair to mention earlier 2d results .",
    "dastgeer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) numerically studied 2d emhd turbulence and found numerical evidence that the turbulence is anisotropic in the presence of a mean field .",
    "dastgeer & zank ( 2003 ) showed that the _ global _ anisotropy of decaying emhd turbulence scales linearly with the inverse of mean magnetic field strength , @xmath143 .",
    "ng et al . ( 2003 ) found local anisotropy of @xmath144 from a 2d emhd simulation .",
    "we will discuss the 2d versus 3d case elsewhere .",
    "conventional mhd turbulence can be decomposed into cascades of alfven , fast and slow modes ( goldreich & sridhar 1995 ; cho & lazarian 2002 ) . while fast and slow modes get damped at larger scales , alfvenic modes can cascade down to the proton larmor radius scale .",
    "these alfven modes excite whistler modes below the scale .",
    "quataert & gruzinov ( 1999 ) discussed transition from conventional alfvenic mhd cascade to emhd cascade in adafs and argued that anisotropy of emhd turbulence is important for electron heating in adafs .",
    "they showed that , depending on the anisotropy of the resulting whistler turbulence , the whistler cascade will or will not transfer most of its energy to electrons . whether or not whistler turbulence is anisotropic is an important question for the physics of accretion disks and gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the strong anisotropy of emhd turbulence makes heating of protons by emhd turbulence rather difficult in astrophysical plasmas with @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the gas to magnetic pressure ratio ( see quataert & gruzinov 1999 ) .",
    "using a numerical simulation , we have studied 3d emhd turbulence .",
    "we have found that energy cascade time scales with @xmath0 .",
