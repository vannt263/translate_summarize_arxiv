    "relativistic jets are observed in many astrophysical systems which host compact objects , such as radio galaxies , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and microquasars .",
    "these jets appear in a variety of lengths , durations and energy scales , and propagate in different types of media .",
    "however , despite the differences in their characteristics , which are many orders of magnitudes apart , the interactions of the jets with their surroundings lead to similar results , such as energy injection into the ambient medium and its feedback on the jet . understanding these common phenomena can provide valuable insights on puzzles such as what type of medium can collimate the jet and how much energy is injected into the surrounding matter .",
    "these in turn can be used to study the heating of the interstellar and intergalactic medium by active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and the fate of jets and stellar envelops of collapsing massive stars during gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the interaction of a jet with the external medium was studied extensively in many different scales , using analytic and numerical methods .",
    "initially it was studied in the context of radio loud agns @xcite .",
    "they showed that the propagation of the jet generates a double bow - shock structure at the head of the jet .",
    "energy and matter that enter this structure are pushed aside due to a high pressure gradient and create a hot cocoon around the jet .",
    "the cocoon , in turn , applies pressure on the jet and compresses it .",
    "@xcite calculated the head s velocity and the cocoon expansion rate , assuming that the cocoon and the head are supported by the ram - pressure of the ambient medium .",
    "their calculations assumes newtonian head velocities and rely on the knowledge of the cross - section of the head , which they estimated phenomenologically using the size of the radio lobes observed around jets of radio loud agns .",
    "@xcite calculated the lorentz factor of a relativistic head assuming a conical jet ( i.e. , no collimation ) .",
    "@xcite extended the model of @xcite to include both newtonian and relativistic head velocities , assuming a conical jet as in @xcite .",
    "later , @xcite used this model to calculate the opening angle and the properties of the jet at breakout from a surface of a collapsing star .",
    "they accounted for the reduction in the opening angle of the jet due to collimation , but ignored the dissipation of energy in shocks that form within the jet as a result of such a collimation .",
    "this led to an incorrect dependence of the opening angle on the cocoon s pressure .",
    "an attempt to include the effects of these shocks was made by @xcite .",
    "apart from the analytical studies the numerical approach was also given a lot of attention over the years .",
    "simulations were conducted in the context of extra galactic jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as grb jets that propagate inside a star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all these works showed the basic features discussed above , i.e. the formation of a jet head and a hot cocoon .",
    "a collimation shock at the base of the jet is also evident in the simulations , whenever the jet is collimated by the cocoon .",
    "however , despite the extensive numerical and analytical efforts , to this date there is no simple analytic description of the time evolution of the jet - cocoon system . as a result",
    ", there is no quantitative understanding of the collimation process , and its effect on the jet angle .",
    "the goal of this work is to provide a simple self consistent , analytic description , for the time evolution of an unmagnetized relativistic jet and the cocoon that forms around it , when it propagates in a density profile that is suitable for most astrophysical systems .",
    "the key point in our analysis is the treatment of the collimation shock that forms at the base of the jet .",
    "this shock is an inevitable consequence of collimation in a supersonic jet , as it dissipates part of the jet s energy , generating the pressure needed to counterbalance the cocoon s pressure .",
    "it is crucial for the proper modeling of the system , since it sets the width of the jet and controls its propagation velocity .",
    "we base our solution on the earlier analysis of @xcite , and incorporate the geometry of the collimation shock as it is analyzed by @xcite .",
    "we find that the jet evolution can be of two types : collimated and un - collimated according to the strength of the jet - cocoon interaction and the collimation shock .",
    "we quantify the transition between these regimes and derive models for the jet and the cocoon evolution in each regime .",
    "we test the validity of our approximations by comparing the results from our model with output of various numerical simulations .",
    "the paper is constructed as follow : in  2 we present a general nontechnical description of the system , its ingredients and the different stages in its evolution . in ",
    "3 we present our model and derive the criterion that distinguishes between the two collimation regimes .",
    "we discuss the geometry of the collimation shock in each regime and analyze how it affects the temporal evolution of the system .",
    "we also provide approximated analytic solutions in each of the regimes .",
    "we compare our analytical model to hydrodynamic simulations in  4 . in  5",
    "we briefly consider jet collimation in various astrophysical environments .",
    "thorough study of specific systems is lengthy and will be presented in following papers . in ",
    "6 we summarize the main results .",
    "the full list of results , that specifies the behavior of the physical quantities in the entire parameter space is summarized in table 1 and in appendix b.",
    "consider an un - magnetized , sufficiently fast ) . ] relativistic jet with a luminosity @xmath0 , injected at a fixed opening angle @xmath1 , into the surrounding medium .",
    "we assume that the entire system ( jet , cocoon and ambient medium ) is axisymmetric and use cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "we further approximate the ambient medium density , @xmath3 , to depend only on the hight , i.e. @xmath4 .",
    "this is a good approximation even in cases where @xmath3 is spherically symmetric ( e.g. , a stellar envelope ) , since the opening angles of the jet and the cocoon are small whenever the the ambient medium plays an important role and collimates the jet .",
    "the jet propagates by pushing the matter in front of it , leading to the formation at the jet s front of a forward shock and a reverse shock that are separated by a contact discontinuity .",
    "we refer to this structure as the jet s head .",
    "matter that enters the head through the shocks is heated and flows sideways since its pressure is higher than that of the surrounding matter ( see fig .",
    "this leads to the formation of a pressured cocoon around the jet .",
    "a contact discontinuity divides the cocoon into an inner , light , part containing the jet material which crossed the reveres shock , and an outer part of the heavier shocked medium .",
    "the pressure in both sides of the discontinuity is equal , but since the plasma is much more tenuous in the inner cocoon , the sound speed there is much larger than in the outer cocoon .",
    "this allows a causal connection along the cocoon , leading to pressure equilibration in the vertical direction and a more uniform distribution of the energy ( see further discussion in [ sec : model ] ) . since our analysis needs only the cocoon s pressure we disregard in the following the cocoon s inner structure .",
    "if the cocoon s pressure is sufficiently high , it collimates the jet and reduces its opening angle .",
    "this changes the jet s propagation velocity and the energy flow into the cocoon .",
    "we classify two regimes of the system : collimated and un - collimated , according to how strongly the jet is affected by the cocoon s pressure .",
    "( [ jet_fig ] ) depicts a schematic description of the system in these two regimes .    in the collimated regime ( fig .",
    "[ jet_fig ] , right panel ) , the cocoon s pressure collimates the jet and reduces substantially its opening angle . since the jet is supersonic , the collimation leads to the formation of an oblique shock at the base of the jet .",
    "this shock deflects the jet flow - lines and generates a pressure that counterbalances the cocoon s pressure . to maintain the required pressure the shock curves toward the jet s axis , until it converges at some altitude ,",
    "above which the collimation is complete ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "the geometry of the collimation shock sets the jet s cross - section at the head to be much smaller than the cross section of an un - collimated jet . consequently the jet applies a larger ram - pressure on the head and pushes it to higher velocities .",
    "the faster motion reduces the rate of energy flow into the cocoon . at the same time the cocoon s height increases at a faster rate , resulting in a larger volume and a decrease in the cocoon s pressure .",
    "there is a limit to the head velocity above which the cocoon s pressure is too low to effectively collimate the jet .",
    "we show that this occurs when @xmath5 , corresponding to a head s lorentz factor @xmath6 .",
    "therefore for typical initial opening angles @xmath7 , the head velocities in the collimated regime can be at most mildly relativistic .",
    "the un - collimated regime is characterized by larger values of @xmath8 and a cocoon pressure which is insufficient to collimate the jet in an appreciable amount .",
    "the jet remains conical to a good approximation and the collimation shock remains at the edges of the jet and does not converge onto the jet s axis .",
    "this results in a coaxial jet structure composed of an inner fast spine surrounded by a denser layer of the shocked jet material , having a lower lorentz factor ( fig .",
    "[ jet_fig ] , left panel ) .",
    "when @xmath9 , the head moves so fast that different parts of the jet s head become causally disconnected and energy can flow into the cocoon only from a small region of the head .",
    "this further reduces the cocoon s pressure . at even larger lorentz factors the reverse shock at the head becomes weak , and it no longer affects the jet , which can be considered as propagating in a vacuum .",
    "the forward shock continues , however , to gather matter from the ambient medium in front of the jet and to accelerates it to a lorentz factor similar to that of the jet .",
    "a small fraction of this shocked matter continues to stream into the cocoon and feeds with relativistic particles .",
    "following the above description we divide the system into five main elements ( see figure [ jet_fig ] ) : un - shocked jet , shocked jet ( by the collimation shock ) , jet s head , cocoon ( containing an inner light part and an outer heavy part ) and ambient medium .",
    "the system dynamics is determined by the following relations between these region .",
    "( i ) the jet s head velocity is set by balancing the ram - pressure applied on the forward shock ( by the ambient medium ) with the ram - pressure applied on the reverse shocks ( by the shocked or unshocked jet , depending on the collimation regime ) .",
    "the head velocity determines the cocoon height and the energy injection rate into it .",
    "the jet head has the highest pressure in the system .",
    "( ii ) the pressure in the cocoon is set by its size and by the energy injected into it from the head .",
    "( iii ) the velocity of the shock that inflates the cocoon into the ambient medium is set by the balance between the ram - pressure of the ambient medium on that shock and the cocoon pressure .",
    "( iv ) the pressure in the shocked jet is equal to the cocoon pressure .",
    "the collimation shock structure is set to build up this pressure in the jet .",
    "this structure , in turn , determines the jet head cross section and thus the ram pressure applied on the reverse shock .",
    "( v ) the un - shocked jet properties are determined by the inner engine .",
    "our model contains the five elements discussed above , where the ambient medium serves as a fixed background . given a jet with a luminosity @xmath0 , an injection angle , @xmath1 , and a medium density profile , @xmath4 , we calculate the time dependent quantities : the head velocity , @xmath10 ( predominantly in the @xmath11 direction ) , the cocoon s pressure , @xmath12 , the cocoon expansion velocity , @xmath13 ( predominantly in the @xmath14 direction ) , and the jet s cross - section @xmath15 .",
    "we use the subindices @xmath16 to designate quantities related to the jet , the jet s head , the cocoon and the ambient medium respectively .",
    "the distinction between the shocked and un - shocked jet is relevant only in the collimated regime , and we use it when we discuss this regime . the subindex @xmath17 is used to describe general properties of the jet ( like the jet dimensions ) and when it is unimportant which of the two region ( shocked or unshocked jet ) is considered , e.g. , the jet luminosity is equal in the two regions and is denoted @xmath0 .",
    "we begin by discussing the main assumptions of the model .",
    "we take @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath18 as given , and derive equations for @xmath10 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath15 .",
    "the later differs between the two collimation regimes , and therefore we present the relevant solution separately in each regime .",
    "the head velocity is set by balancing the ram - pressure applied on the forward and reverse shocks @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the mass density , pressure and dimensionless specific enthalpy of each fluid , measured in the fluid s rest frame , and @xmath23 is the proper fluid velocity in the frame of the ambient medium . when the temperature of the ambient medium is non - relativistic and as long as the reverse shock is strong , @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be ignored . under these conditions",
    "the head s velocity is @xcite : @xmath26 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath27 represents the ratio between the energy density of the jet ( @xmath28 ) and the rest - mass energy density of the surrounding medium at the location of the head .",
    "note that by defining @xmath29 as such , we implicitly assume that the energy lost in the jet due to work against the pressure of the cocoon is negligible and that radiation losses are negligible as well .",
    "we discuss this assumption at length in appendix a , and show that it is valid as long as the jet injection angle , @xmath1 , is not too large . as we show in the following sections , @xmath29 is the critical parameter that determines the evolution of the jet and the cocoon , while the combination @xmath30 distinguishes between collimated and un - collimated jets .",
    "we stress that @xmath29 may vary with the propagation of the jet , even if the jet luminosity is constant , depending on the density profile of the ambient medium and on the behavior of the jet s cross section .",
    "thus , a jet can switch between the different collimation regimes , from collimated to un - collimated and vice versa . specifically a collimated jet that encounters a sharp density decline may becomes uncollimated .    in the limits @xmath31 or @xmath32 , eq .",
    "( [ bh ] ) can be linearized @xcite : when @xmath31 @xmath33 corresponding to a non - relativistic head velocity . if @xmath34 @xmath35 which corresponds to a relativistic proper velocity of the head , @xmath36 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "when @xmath37 , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ bh ] ) that @xmath38 , implying a non - relativistic reverse shock and a negligible energy flow of the shocked jet material into the cocoon .",
    "this is equivalent to the requirement that the volumetric - enthalpy ratio of the jet and the ambient medium , @xmath39 , and is similar to the criterion given by @xcite for the case of a cold jet .",
    "the pressure in the cocoon is sustained by a continuous flow of energy from the head . at any given moment the total energy in the cocoon is @xmath40 , where the second term in the brackets represents the fraction of the energy which is carried by the relativistic jet and hasnt reached the cocoon yet @xcite .",
    "the parameter , @xmath41 , varies between 0 and 1 .",
    "it stands for the fraction of the energy that flows into the head and enters later into the cocoon .",
    "we assume that all the energy in the region of the head that is in causal connection with the cocoon flows into the cocoon , so @xmath41 is the fraction of that region out of the total head volume .",
    "when @xmath42 most of the energy that flows out is initially tapped to the bulk motion of the fluid and it ca nt contribute to the pressure .",
    "however , later , as the matter enters the cocoon it spreads sideways and decelerates exponentially to @xmath43 , in a similar manner to a rapidly spreading jet in a grb afterglow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore practically all the energy that flows into the cocoon is available to generate pressure .",
    "the energy in the cocoon is shared between two parts which are separated by a contact discontinuity : an outer part made of the shocked ambient medium with a typical density @xmath44 , and an inner part that consists of the lighter jet material that crossed the reverse shock and enters from the head ( see fig .",
    "the outer cocoon is supported from the sides by the ram pressure of the surrounding medium , which balances its pressure .",
    "this results in a lateral expansion velocity of @xmath45 which is just below the sound speed in the outer cocoon as long as @xmath13 is sub relativistic . in the inner cocoon",
    "the sound speed is relativistic and typically much faster than @xmath13 .",
    "thus , matter on both sides of the contact discontinuity is in causal contact in the lateral direction and any pressure difference in this direction is smoothed out . in the longitude direction",
    "the inner cocoon connects the upper parts of the cocoon with lower parts which otherwise would have been out of causal contact .",
    "this suppresses the pressure drop in the vertical direction , and in cases where the head is sub relativistic leads to a uniform distribution of energy in the cocoon .",
    "the size of the region connected by the inner cocoon is determined by the survival length of the contact discontinuity , which is set by the growth rate of kelvin - helmholtz instabilities .",
    "the small shear - velocity differences on both sides of the contact render the growth rate small and stabilize the contact discontinuity .",
    "indeed numerical simulations show that the contact discontinuity remains intact for a considerable fraction of the cocoon s length , and that the pressure drop is suppressed ( see  4 ) .",
    "we stress that the uniform pressure approximation should also hold rather well in cases where @xmath12 develops some vertical gradient since the conditions in the jet s head depends only weakly on the pressure gradient .    to calculate the cocoon s pressure we make the following approximations : first we take the cocoon s shape to be a cylinder with a hight @xmath46 and a radius @xmath47 .",
    "second , based on the discussion above , we approximate the energy density to be uniformly distributed within the cocoon .",
    "third , over a wide range of parameters and especially in the systems relevant for us , the pressure in the cocoon is radiation dominated , thus we use in our analysis an adiabatic index of @xmath48 . under these approximations",
    "the cocoon s pressure satisfies : @xmath49 to calculate the transverse velocity of the cocoon we take the average density of the medium @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the volume of the cocoon , and obtain the lateral expansion velocity : ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath52 approximating @xmath53 and @xmath54 and substitute into eq .",

    "the value of @xmath56 in each regime is given in the appendix , where we list the full time dependent solutions of eqn .",
    "( [ bh ] ) , ( [ pc ] ) and ( [ bc ] ) in the limits : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .      in the collimated regime the pressure in the cocoon is sufficiently strong to compress the jet and form a strong oblique shock at the base of the jet .",
    "the jet s head is then at full causal contact and therefore @xmath58 .",
    "the collimation shock divides the jet into a pre - shocked and a shocked region .",
    "we designate them by subindices @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ shock_fig ] ) .",
    "the flow - lines in area @xmath59 are radial and they encounter the shock at an angle @xmath61 , defined as the angle between the original direction of the flow - line and the shock surface .",
    "as the flow - lines pass through the shock , they are deflected toward the jet s axis .",
    "some of the flow energy is dissipated generating the pressure that supports the jet against the compression of the cocoon .",
    "the shock s geometry is set by the balance between the cocoon s pressure and the upstream momentum flux , normal to the shock , that enters at the upstream @xcite : @xmath62 since the jet is relativistic and its ram pressure is much larger than its internal pressure , @xmath63 can be neglected on the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ coll_shoc_jump ] ) .",

    "<S> relativistic jets are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems that contain compact objects . </S>",

    "<S> this parameter , together with the jet s injection angle , also determines whether the jet is collimated by the cocoon or not . </S>",
