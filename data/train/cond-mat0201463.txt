    "the viscosity of polymer melts has been investigated intensively.@xcite the models for describing this behavior , however , are not yet satisfying .",
    "experiments show that the viscosity @xmath0 scales like @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the molecular weight .",
    "this behavior is valid for several decades of the molecular weight .",
    "an early approach was the reptation model by de gennes @xcite which yields @xmath3 in the limit of infinitely long polymers . for short polymers",
    "doi@xcite calculated the viscosity by taking tube length fluctuations into account and found a region of @xmath2 where the scaling is of the correct size  but this region appears to be much too small .",
    "a discrete model for reptation which includes tube length fluctuations is the rubinstein  duke ( rd ) model.@xcite recently it was shown @xcite that this model does not only provide a region where a scaling of @xmath1 can be found , as already shown by rubinstein , @xcite but also that this model shows a crossover to the reptation exponent 3 .",
    "but again the mass region where the correct exponent is valid does not exceed one order of magnitude . in this paper",
    "we extend the rd model in order to investigate whether constraint release ( cr ) broadens that region .",
    "while good models for the non  linear regime of viscosity can be constructed by using cr , @xcite there was only little success in the linear regime.@xcite +",
    "in order to investigate the role of tube length fluctuations in reptation theory rubinstein introduced a discrete `` repton '' model which allows the description of three  dimensional reptation dynamics by a one  dimensional lattice gas.@xcite duke generalized the model to the case that an external electric field acts on a charged polymer@xcite which allows a good description of the diffusion constant in gel electrophorese experiments.@xcite however , also in the absence of a field the generalization by duke is useful in so far as it provides a reference axis along which the displacement of the polymer chain as a whole can be monitored . this makes it possible to calculate the diffusion coefficient and the viscosity from the model , without resorting to independent hypotheses .",
    "+ rubinstein assumes that the constraints of the other polymers divide space into cells which form a @xmath4dimensional regular cubic lattice .",
    "the polymer occupies a series of adjacent cells , the `` primitive path '' .",
    "it is not possible for the polymer to traverse the edges of the cells ( in two dimensions : the lattice points ) so that only the ends of the polymer can enter new cells .",
    "the polymer is divided into segments whose length is of the order of the lattice constant , the number of segments is proportional to the length of the polymer or the molecular weight .",
    "the orientation of the lattice is introduced by duke in a way that the electric field is diagonal to the lattice , i.e. in three dimensions in the ( 111)direction . +",
    "a segment  called a `` repton ''  is allowed to jump into an adjacent cell according to the following rules : +    1 .",
    "the reptons in the bulk are only allowed to jump along the primitive path .",
    "no cell in the interior of the primitive path may be left empty .",
    "3 .   the ends move freely insofar rule 2 is respected .",
    "if an end repton occupies the cell alone , it can only retract in the cell of the adjacent repton .",
    "if the adjacent repton is in the same cell , the end repton may enter any of the @xmath5 surrounding cells .",
    "reptons in the bulk jump with the same probability as reptons at the end into occupied cells .",
    "rule 1 ensures that the polymer does not traverse the edges of the cells .",
    "rule 2 is motivated by the fact that the segments are of the size of the lattice constant .",
    "finally rule 3 reflects the fact that there are more free adjacent cells for an end repton than occupied ones .",
    "if one considers a field @xmath6 the ratio of the probabilities to jump in respectively against the direction of the field is proportional to the boltzmann weight . in the following",
    "we will only focus on the case without field , we only need the reference axis . + as the shape of the primitive path is not affected by the movement of the polymer and only the ends are created or annihilated this model can be mapped onto one dimension . to this end",
    "a particle is assigned to each bond between reptons ; starting on one end , a bond into the direction of the field is identified with an @xmath7particle , against the field with a @xmath8particle and finally a bond without change of potential , i.e. a bond between two reptons in one cell , by a vacancy @xmath9 ( fig .",

    "we have chosen the time scale such that the hopping rate in the bulk equals unity .",
    "the viscosity is proportional to the longest relaxation time of the stochastic generator @xmath31 which is the inverse energy gap.@xcite due to the conservation of probability the ground state of a stochastic generator has the eigenvalue zero , so that we only need to calculate the first eigenvalue .",

    "+ the hilbert space of the spin chain grows exponentially with the number sites @xmath10 ; the number of states is @xmath45 , so that for @xmath46  the maximum number of sites considered in our calculations  the number of states is of the order @xmath47 . by this",
    "it is reasonable to project all quantities onto a subspace consisting of the most important states .",
    "the difficulty is to find out which states are the `` most important '' .",
    "the dmrg algorithm is a method which provides a choice of states which is optimal in terms of a maximum of the probability with which the states contribute to the target state.@xcite this probability is gained by diagonalizing the density matrix . as the diagonalization of the density matrix for",
    "the whole system would be as laborious as the direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian the system is build up stepwise . starting with a small system ( e.g. 2 states )",
    "one adds iteratively two states until the system has reached the searched size . in each step",
    "the hilbert space is reduced to the subspace of the most probable states , so that the system size increases while the dimension of the matrices remain constant .",
    "the rd model as well as standard reptation theory is based on the assumption that the polymer moves in a fixed network formed by the surrounding polymers .",
    "this assumption is at best justifiable for a single polymer immersed in a gel .",
    "but for polymer melts , for which the viscosity is measured , it should be taken into account that the surrounding polymers reptate themselves . in terms of the rubinstein model",
    "this means that the lattice itself is subjected to fluctuations .",
    "+ we consider the following model of lattice fluctuations : imagine that a constraining polymer moves so far that the constraint for the investigated polymer is released so that it can move freely in this region .",
    "after a short time the constraining polymer returns or an other polymer has taken its place so that the free movement in this region is again prevented .",
    "the lattice has regained its originally structure but the primitive path may have changed in the bulk ( fig . [ cr1 ] ) .",
    "this is what we call a `` constraint release '' ( cr ) event .     + a straightforward implementation of this mechanism is shown in fig .",
    "the turning of bend of the primitive path equals to the permutation of an @xmath48pair . at the ends of the path @xmath7particles",
    "can be transformed into @xmath8particles and vice versa which corresponds to a cr event at the ends .",
    "+ to construct the extended hamiltonian which takes these mechanisms into account we introduce an operator which transforms @xmath8particles into @xmath7particles : @xmath49 the adjoint operator effects the reversed process .",
    "the corresponding diagonal elements are build up by @xmath50 respectively @xmath51 .",
    "now the new hamiltonian can be written as : @xmath52\\\\ v_n(\\alpha)&= \\alpha \\left [ n_n^b n_{n+1}^a - c_n c^\\dagger_{n+1 } + n_n^a n_{n+1}^b - c_n^\\dagger c_{n+1}\\right ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ] with the hamiltonian @xmath31 from eq .",
    "( [ h_rubinstein_duke ] ) , and @xmath53 labels the rate for the cr process .",
    "in order to investigate the dependence of the viscosity on the cr rate @xmath53 we performed dmrg calculations for the rates @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . the choice of these rates is based on two estimates .",
    "the first is very simple : a constraint is released when an end repton retracts back into the tube .",
    "the probability that the constraint is exerted by an end repton is @xmath57 , provided that the probability for the presence of a segment is equally distributed .",
    "the hopping of a single repton is a process of rate one and so we find that the rate for a cr is of the order @xmath54 . for the second estimate",
    "we assume that a cr is caused by a tube renewal . later in this paper",
    "we will show the calculation of this estimate within the rouse model which leads to the result that the rate @xmath53 is proportional to the inverse relaxation time and scales therefore with @xmath56 .",
    "+ the viscosity which was calculated with these rates for the mechanism of ab exchange is plotted in fig .",
    "[ eta_cr ] .",
    "it can bee seen that the viscosity decreases with increasing cr rate which is reasonable because the relaxation of the tube is accelerated by this process . for the investigation of the scaling it",
    "is more useful to plot the local slope or the effective exponent @xmath58 against @xmath59 as introduced in ref . .",
    "the choice of the abscissa is motivated by the formula of doi@xcite which predicts a correction to the @xmath60scaling in the order of @xmath59 by taking tube length fluctuations into account .",
    "it should be mentioned that in this paper @xmath10 labels the number of segments which is proportional to the length of the polymer while in ref .",
    "it labels the number of reptons which is the number of segments plus one .",
    "surprisingly the latter interpretation shows a better agreement with the doi formula while the former shows a better agreement with the experiments since the range where @xmath61 is much broader .     + the influence on the effective exponent @xmath62 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ exp_cr ] .",
    "the influence is non  monotonic in @xmath53 : while the rate @xmath54 causes an obvious shift down in comparison with the data without cr , the data of rate @xmath55 is located above the curve without cr .",
    "the data of rate @xmath56 is also located above the curve without cr but at a smaller distance . + we remark that from a theoretical point of view also the rate @xmath63 is interesting .",
    "if @xmath7 and @xmath8particles exchange with the same rate as particles with vacancies , the particle can diffuse freely , as they feel no longer restrictions .",
    "this means that the reptation model transforms into the rouse model as the tube can change its form freely .",
    "this is why rate @xmath63 represents a possibility to verify the model : the relaxation time should scale in the limit @xmath64 as @xmath65 .",
    "but the dmrg calculation of the effective exponent with this rate yields a diverging curve . on the other hand ,",
    "if the second excitation is considered , one can see that it scales as @xmath66 .",
    "this suggests that the first excitation is caused by an other relaxation mechanism and the second excitation yields the desired time , which scales with the expected exponent whereby the transition to rouse dynamics is verified .",
    "+ the bounds @xmath67 are rather weak and a self  consistent approach is needed for determining the appropriate scaling of the rate @xmath53 . as a cr event",
    "is caused by the tube renewal of a polymer , this process is not independent of the relaxation time . the relaxation time itself",
    "is affected by the cr rate .",
    "so the rate is physical , if the relaxation time , which is calculated using this rate , yields the same cr rate .",
    "+ to calculate the self consistent rate @xmath68 we proceed as follows : the dependence of the cr rate on the relaxation time @xmath69 is estimated by an analytical calculation using rouse dynamics .",
    "the dmrg calculation with the rates mentioned above yields directly the dependence of the relaxation time on the cr rate @xmath70 for the respective chain lengths .",
    "the inverse function of @xmath69 , @xmath71 , is compared with @xmath70 : the intersection of the curves yields the self consistent rate @xmath68 in first approximation .",
    "+ first we calculate the dependence of the cr rate on the relaxation time .",
    "the polymer whose relaxation time we want to calculate finally is hindered in his free movement by an other polymer . the position which exerts the constraint may have the distance @xmath72 from one end of the constraining polymer .",
    "so , the constraint is released when the polymer moves either the distance @xmath72 into the one direction or the distance @xmath73 into the other direction , where @xmath10 labels the length of the polymer . in ref .",
    "an expression is presented which provides the distribution @xmath74 of the probability that the tube segment @xmath72 was at time @xmath22 not yet reached by the ends : @xmath75 with the relaxation time @xmath76 .",
    "the calculation of this formula bases on the assumption that the polymer diffuses in between the tube due to rouse dynamics .",
    "the complementary probability distribution @xmath77 , which indicates the probability that at time @xmath22 the segment @xmath72 is already reached by one of the ends is then @xmath78 the derivate with respect to time @xmath79 is the first passage time density , i.e. the probability per time that the segment @xmath72 is reached by one end just at time @xmath22 .",
    "now we can specify the mean first passage time @xmath80 which indicates how long it takes in average until segment @xmath72 is reached by an end .",
    "finally we average over all @xmath72 provided that each segment builds up an entanglement with the same probability @xmath81 this is the desired time : in average the release of a constraint will take the time @xmath82 , the cr process takes place with rate @xmath83 .",
    "the calculation of the integrals is elementary mathematics and we only show the result : @xmath84 this calculation is based on a continuous description of the polymer .",
    "however , we are considering a lattice model of reptation so that boundary effects might not be taken into account correctly by the continuum expression ( [ mu ] ) .",
    "therefore we performed the above calculation as well for the discrete case .",
    "as the result for the discrete case converges quickly to the continuous case but consists of only numerical evaluable series , we restricted ourselves to the continuous case here .",
    "there is an error of less than 2 per cent for as little as 10 reptons .",
    "[ fig_tau_alpha ] shows the curve @xmath85 and the relaxation times for the cr rates @xmath86 and @xmath55 exemplified for @xmath87 , the data point for @xmath88 is out of the plotted range . in order to investigate the dependence of the relaxation time on the cr rate we interpolated the data points linearly by fitting them with splines .",
    "the data points are is well approximated by this interpolation in the region where the intersection point is expected . in this way we determined the self consistent relaxation times and rates for the lengths @xmath89 .",
    "as the lengths @xmath90 and @xmath91 do not lead to reasonable intersection points we did not take them into account . to verify the self consistence",
    "a new dmrg run was done with a fit of the determined rates ; as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ eta_sc ] the resulting relaxation times coincide well with the ones determined by the self consistence condition , so that the linear interpolation represents a sufficiently good approximation . + in fig . [ exp_sc ] the effective exponent is shown for the self consistent relaxation times and for the dmrg calculation .",
    "the exponent is shifted to higher values in the region of small @xmath10 , but a broadening of the region where @xmath92 could not be observed .",
    "+     + the rubinstein model is not microscopic and hence there is some freedom in implementing microscopic process such as cr .",
    "a different mechanism@xcite leads to the creation and annihilation of particles in the bulk .",
    "we performed similar analysis for this mechanism with qualitatively similar results.@xcite + we conclude that rouse  based calculations do not lead to a proper description of crossover behavior in the viscosity of polymer melts when rouse theory is used as a self consistency input in the mesoscopic and generally quite successful rubinstein model for reptation .",
    "we can not rule out that a fully self  consistent implementation of cr ( without rouse assumption ) leads to a crossover regime closer to empirical evidence , but the broad range of cr rates studied here suggests that bulk shape fluctuations of the tube which result from constraint release do not significantly broaden the crossover range of the viscosity .",
