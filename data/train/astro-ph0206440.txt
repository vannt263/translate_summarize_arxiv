    "ngc 2168 ( m35 ) is a rich open cluster with an age similar to the pleiades . since m35 is more populous and covers a smaller angular extent than the pleiades , it offers excellent opportunities for studies of stellar evolution at @xmath14 myr , even though m35 is further away and suffers greater background contamination .",
    "astrometric studies of m35 have a long history ( ebbighausen 1942 ; meurers & schwarz 1960 ; lavdovskij 1961 ; cudworth 1971 ; mcnamara & sekiguchi 1986a ) , and in fact continue to this day ",
    "m35 is _ the _ astrometric calibrator for the hst fine guidance sensors ( mcarthur et al .",
    "modern photometric studies of this cluster begin with sung & lee ( 1992 ) who obtained photoelectric @xmath15 photometry for 112 field plus cluster stars to @xmath16 , approximately the same limiting magnitude as the two more recent proper motion studies .",
    "sung & lee derived a true distance modulus of 9.3 , an age of 85 myr , and internal differential reddening of @xmath17 e(@xmath6 ) @xmath18 . in a subsequent study ,",
    "sung & bessel ( 1999 ) obtained @xmath19 ccd photometry for stars brighter than @xmath20 in a central @xmath21 cluster field . from these data they derived @xmath22 , e@xmath23 ( corresponding to @xmath24 for @xmath25 ) , log age = 8.3 @xmath26 0.3 ( 200 myr ) , [ fe / h ] @xmath27 ( based on @xmath28 color excess ) , a present day mass function slope of @xmath29 , , where the reported slope = @xmath30 , and the salpeter ( 1955 ) value is @xmath31 . ] and a binary frequency @xmath32% .",
    "a younger cluster age of 70 to 100 myr was found by reimers & koester ( 1988a ) , based on a reanalysis of older photometry along with isochrones from maeder & mermilliod ( 1981 ) and on the cooling age of two cluster white dwarfs .",
    "barrado y navascus , deliyannis , & stauffer ( 2001a ) have derived the cluster metallicity , [ fe / h ] = @xmath33 , from high resolution spectroscopy . in the most recent photometric study of m35 , barrado y navascus et al .",
    "( 2001b , hereafter bsbm ) , using the kitt peak 4 m and cfh 3.6 m telescopes , imaged the central @xmath34 of the cluster in @xmath35 to @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "bsbm found a luminosity function similar to the pleiades , with a peak near @xmath38 , and present - day mass function characterized by three different power law slopes over the mass range 1.6 to @xmath39 m@xmath9 .",
    "bsbm found their central cluster field to contain @xmath40 m@xmath9 among cluster members .    in a dynamical study of m35 ,",
    "leonard & merritt ( 1989 ) found that m35 is close to dynamical equilibrium , that its dynamical mass within the central 3.75 pc is 1600 to 3200 m@xmath9 ( 95% confidence ) , and that its imf slope is @xmath41 between 1 and 6 m@xmath9 .",
    "mathieu ( 1983 ) , mcnamara & sekiguchi ( 1986b ) , and bsbm all noted that m35 exhibits mass segregation , though it is unclear whether this is due to relaxation or initial conditions .",
    "mathieu ( 1983 ) pointed out that the cluster age is close to the expected relaxation time of the intermediate mass component , though the relaxation time scale is uncertain by a factor of 2 .",
    "we obtained deep @xmath0 photometry of m35 in order to study the low mass main sequence stars and to search for cluster white dwarfs .",
    "our study presents higher signal - to - noise data for the faintest stars than the bsbm study , and we achieve this depth in @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , whereas bsbm achieve their greatest depth in @xmath44 and @xmath43 .",
    "our photometry allows us to isolate the fiducial main sequence of the cluster in @xmath45 and @xmath4 , as well as @xmath4 and @xmath43 , which we compare to a range of stellar models .",
    "the smaller field of view of our study precludes a detailed luminosity function or mass function study , however , as done by bsbm . in these trade - offs between field of view and depth in various filters ,",
    "our two deep photometric studies are complementary .",
    "in addition , we have found a candidate cluster white dwarf which , if a _ bona fide _ cluster member , places constraints on a combination of cluster age and stellar evolution .",
    "we observed m35 and a nearby comparison field at the wiyn 3.5 m telescope located on kitt peak through harris @xmath45- and @xmath4-band and mould interference @xmath43-band filters ( massey et al .",
    "1987 ) on the nights of december 31 , 1997 , january 1 , 1998 , and january 22 , 1998 .",
    "all of these nights were non - photometric , though the seeing was excellent , ranging from 0.46 to 1.0 arcseconds fwhm , with the majority of the observations obtained during 0.6 to 0.8 arcsecond seeing conditions , even in the @xmath45-band .",
    "total exposure times of 4500 , 3357 , and 7200 seconds in @xmath45 , @xmath4 , and @xmath43 , respectively , were obtained on a field centered on m35 , at ra = @xmath46 , dec = @xmath47 ( 2000 ) , corresponding to galactic coordinates _",

    "= 186.39 , 2.30 degrees .",
    "the ccd detector then in use at wiyn , `` s2 kb , '' is a @xmath49 stis ccd with 21 micron ( = 0.2 ) pixels and a field of view of @xmath50 arc minutes .",
    "data reduction followed standard procedures virtually identical to those described for the old open cluster ngc 188 by von hippel & sarajedini ( 1998 , hereafter wocs1 ) .",
    "briefly , we removed a time - dependent , two - dimensional bias structure with the help of the overscan regions and standard bias frames to within a typical accuracy of 1 adu . for these broad - band exposures the high sky meant that this bias uncertainty was always much less than 1% .",
    "flat fielding was performed using dome flats with typical pixel - to - pixel poisson uncertainties of @xmath51% and illumination pattern uncertainties @xmath52% .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were extracted from each image individually using allframe ( stetson 1994 ) .",
    "we employed a quadratically varying psf , defined using the brightest 50100 isolated stars , and refined by iteratively subtracting faint neighbors .",
    "these psfs along with a master coordinate list of stellar positions for each field were input into allframe which then produced total psf magnitudes for all detected profiles .",
    "the psf magnitudes measured for each frame were corrected to total magnitudes by applying a spatially variable aperture correction .",
    "the amplitude of this correction was never more than @xmath260.02 mag but was nevertheless applied to maximize the accuracy of the resultant photometry .",
    "we edited the photometry using fitting quality diagnostics provided by allframe .",
    "in particular , we set a maximum overall chi value of 2.5 and a maximum mean magnitude error in 0.5 mag bins of 2@xmath53 .",
    "we also stipulated that the distribution of sharp values be symmetric around zero and thus edited outlying sharp values until this was accomplished .",
    "since the nights were not photometric , the wiyn data were placed on the standard system of landolt ( 1983 , 1992 ) using photometric , calibrated @xmath0 observations ( deliyannis et al .",
    "2002 ) of the central @xmath54 of m35 taken on the night of october 24 , 1998 with the kpno 0.9 m telescope .",
    "the 0.9 m m35 observations were first calibrated via the landolt standards , and then the 0.9 m data were used to calibrate the wiyn data .",
    "the details of the standards observed to calibrate the 0.9 m m35 observations are presented in table 1 .",
    "column 1 lists the filter in question , with two different color calibrations given for the @xmath4-band , one based on the @xmath6 color and the other based on the @xmath7 color .",
    "column 2 lists the number of independent ccd frames taken of the standard fields , column 3 lists the number of standards used to derive the photometric transformations , columns 4 and 5 list the photometric zero points and their associated errors , columns 6 and 7 list the derived airmass coefficients and their errors , and columns 8 and 9 list the derived color terms and their errors .",
    "the standard observations spanned the same ut range as the cluster observations , though not the same airmass range .",
    "the airmass range for the standards was 1.181.64 , whereas the cluster was observed over a lower and more restricted airmass range , 1.011.06 .",
    "while the landolt standards were observed at a slightly higher minimum airmass than m35 , this was unavoidable given our desire to observe m35 at the lowest possible airmass , whereas the landolt fields are located on the celestial equator .",
    "the airmass terms were linear , so this extrapolation to airmass = 1.0 ( from airmass = 1.18 ) should have a minimal effect on the standardization .",
    "in our standardization procedure we define the color terms for all filters with respect to @xmath4 . for the @xmath4 calibration",
    ", @xmath6 was used preferentially .",
    "however , the @xmath7 color term was also calculated for @xmath4 , and used when a @xmath45 magnitude was not available for a given program star .",
    "this allowed us to take full advantage of our greater photometric depth in @xmath4 and @xmath43 than in @xmath45 .",
    "the color terms were linear , small , and had tiny uncertainties .    while the 0.9 m m35 observations probed to @xmath0 = 2021 , @xmath55 mag shallower than the wiyn observations , there remained @xmath56 magnitudes of overlap between the two data sets , and the stars in common cover much of the range in color ( for @xmath45 the range was @xmath6 = 0.921.89 and for @xmath3 the range was @xmath7 = 0.172.28 ) .",
    "we thus calibrated the wiyn photometry from the many ( 92 to 292 , depending on the filter and field ) stars in common with the 0.9 m photometry .",
    "we calculated transformations between the two data sets , taking into account possible changes in the color dependence of the offset . for the @xmath45 filter ,",
    "the following equations were solved :    @xmath57    @xmath58    where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are instrumental magnitudes and @xmath45 and @xmath4 are standard magnitudes .",
    "the constants were empirically determined .",
    "similar equations were used to standardize the @xmath4 and @xmath43 data using the @xmath7 color in the transformation .    based on experience with these instruments and similar data , we estimate the total systematic error of our standardized photometry to be @xmath61 mag . note ,",
    "however , that the reddest landolt standard we used had @xmath6 = 1.9 and @xmath7 = 2.4 , whereas our data continue to @xmath6 = 2.4 and @xmath7 = 4.0 . since the color terms for the lower main sequence are extrapolations , the photometry for the reddest stars is likely to be less accurate than the numbers quoted above . since the reddest stars are of particular importance in this study we explored two avenues to constrain any possible systematic shifts in the photometry .",
    "in the first approach , we perturbed all the photometric transformation coefficients by @xmath62 and by @xmath63 .",
    "this approach only indicates whether errors in the transformation coefficients themselves matter in the extrapolation , of course , and not whether different transformation coefficients are appropriate for the reddest stars .",
    "the mutual probability that all four ( per filter ) transformation coefficients would be each wrong by @xmath62 or @xmath63 is @xmath64% ( i.e. ,  a @xmath65 error ) .",
    "this @xmath65 envelope at the very bottom of the main sequence corresponds to only @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this small error range is gratifying and due to the fact that the color terms are small and linear , and the photometric calibration , especially in @xmath4 and @xmath43 , was excellent .",
    "as a second constraint on any systematic errors in the color terms we performed synthetic photometry for a range of f0v to m6v stars from the pickles ( 1998 ) spectral library , using the tracings for the wiyn filters and the measured quantum efficiency versus wavelength for the s2 kb ccd .",
    "the synthetic photometry was compared to standard @xmath6 and @xmath7 colors for stars of the same mk type compiled by johnson ( 1966 ) .",
    "overall we found excellent agreement between our synthetic color terms and those we derive from the standard star observations , except for the very reddest stars where our synthetic photometry indicated that our extrapolated color terms may make the faintest cluster members too blue in both @xmath6 and @xmath7 by 0.1 to 0.2 mag .",
    "we do not apply the offset indicated by the synthetic photometry , but rather use it as a guideline to the level of the likely systematic color error at the limit of the main sequence .",
    "this level of error is acceptable and less than the differences we will explore between the data and stellar models .    as a final step in the data reduction process , we measure image morphology using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) in order to reject non - stellar objects .",
    "sextractor has the advantage of determining sky locally and uses verified neural network techniques to perform the star / galaxy classification .",
    "figure 1 shows the results of the sextractor morphological classification versus @xmath43-band magnitude for both the m35 and control fields .",
    "the morphological `` stellarity index '' ranges from 0 for galaxies or obvious imaging defects to 1 for stars .",
    "although sextractor s neural network classifier is not strictly a bayesian classifier , the stellarity index values are approximately the probabilities that the object is a point source .",
    "the classifications near 0.5 at the faintest magnitudes demonstrates the common sense notion that at limiting signal - to - noise classification breaks down .",
    "objects from the m35 central field are plotted as small filled circles .",
    "objects from the control field are plotted as small open circles and shifted down by 0.1 and to the right by 1 mag , so that both data sets can be clearly seen in the same plot .",
    "figure 1 demonstrates that the morphological - magnitude distribution of objects in both fields is essentially identical , the result of observations obtained under excellent and stable conditions .",
    "the large number of definite stars in figure 1 is the result of a cluster plus a rich galactic field , and the significant suppression of background galaxies is caused by the high line - of - sight absorption in front of and behind m35 .",
    "still , there is extragalactic contamination , which we now remove .",
    "we select those objects determined by sextractor to have a high ( @xmath68 , marked by the dashed lines in figure 1 ) probability of being stars based on their @xmath43-band morphology , since the @xmath43-band is the deepest and best resolved , particularly for the faintest red cluster stars . while some of the objects with lower stellarity indices may be stars , we wish to be conservative in our attribution of objects to the cluster , especially at the faintest magnitudes and intermediate colors , where galaxies may contribute significantly to the number counts .",
    "as it turns out , there are few contaminating galaxies brighter than @xmath69 , above which we have excellent morphological classifications . for @xmath70",
    ", we reject only 3.5% and 1.2% of the objects in the central and control field as being non - stellar , respectively .",
    "fainter than this limit the morphological classifications begin to degrade , but this is so faint , particularly on the main sequence where it is equivalent to @xmath71 , that it has no effect on any of the statistical cluster quantities that we derive .    the cleaned and calibrated color magnitude diagrams ( cmds )",
    "are presented in figures 2a through 2d . in these figures",
    "the morphological criterion is essentially equivalent to a signal - to - noise cut ( at @xmath72 ) in the @xmath43-band .",
    "since the @xmath45- and @xmath4-band observations are shallower than the @xmath43-band observations , however , the limiting depths in figures 2a - d are not due to our morphology statistic .",
    "individual error bars are not plotted for clarity but typical photometric errors at each integer @xmath4-band magnitude starting at @xmath73 are presented down the right - hand sides of figures 2a - d .",
    "these errors are internal errors only .",
    "the dynamic range of our wiyn observations is approximately 10 magnitudes , with the cluster main sequence evident over 8 or 9 magnitudes . for comparison ,",
    "note that the cluster turn - off is another 7 magnitudes brighter than the brightest photometry presented here , at @xmath74 .",
    "although m35 is a rich cluster , as is particularly evident along the well - populated upper main sequence ( see figure 3 of sung & bessell 1999 ) or from wide field images such as the palomar observatory sky survey , when viewed in deep cmds as presented here , there are clearly far fewer stars belonging to m35 than to the background galactic field .",
    "this is expected given the low galactic latitude and the tremendous volume surveyed behind the cluster .",
    "typical field stars are 1 to 4 mags fainter than the cluster main sequence at a given @xmath6 or @xmath7 color . even though most of these objects are main sequence stars , they still reside at distances of 1.6 to 6.3 times further away than the cluster , and thus these cmds survey a huge volume of the background galactic disk .",
    "even with the copious background , the cluster main sequence is discernible in the central field , and possibly in the control field . at @xmath75 north of the cluster center",
    ", our control field may not completely avoid cluster stars .",
    "this will be discussed in a statistical context , below .",
    "( in fact , the control field was initially selected to be within the cluster periphery so that we could measure luminosity functions in both the cluster center and periphery in order to look for signatures of mass segregation . the low number density of faint cluster stars precluded that comparison , but left us with a very useful control field that is a good compromise between avoiding the cluster entirely and moving so far away that the background field is not comparable  a potential problem given the steep gradient in stellar counts near the galactic plane and the variable , though not large , reddening in this field . ) visually , the cluster main sequence can be traced to @xmath76 in the @xmath7 cmd .",
    "the cluster binary sequence is not obvious in these cmds ( more on this later ) .",
    "finally , a few blue objects between @xmath77 and @xmath78 can be seen in both the central and control field cmds .",
    "we explore the likelihood that any of these objects are cluster white dwarfs and the implications for the cluster and white dwarf physics below .",
    "we adopt the cluster parameters from our wide - field study in preparation ( deliyannis et al .",
    "2002 ) , i.e. ,  @xmath79 , e(@xmath6 ) = 0.20 , and age = 150 myr , although we will check the validity of the distance and reddening assumption based on fitting the 0.9 m main sequence photometry to other cluster main sequences observed by hipparcos ( pinsonneault et al .",
    "we also adopt e(@xmath7 ) = 1.34 e(@xmath6 ) based on the central wavelengths of the wiyn @xmath4 and @xmath43 filters and the relations of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) .",
    "note that our distance and reddening are roughly consistent with , but not identical to , those used by bsbm , who adopted e(@xmath6 ) = 0.255 from sung & bessell ( 1999 ) and who used an @xmath43-band distance modulus corresponding to @xmath80 . before performing the main sequence fitting",
    ", we first extract the cluster fiducial sequence by employing our control field to remove the contaminating galactic field stars .",
    "the m35 and comparison fields were observed to similar depths under similar conditions , presenting us with sufficient data to perform a good statistical subtraction of the contaminating field stars . as a first attempt at this subtraction we identified nearest neighbors in the central and control cmds ,",
    "then subtracted them .",
    "we also tried variants on this technique where the number of objects in boxes of different sizes were computed in each cmd , then subtracted .",
    "this entire approach proved unsatisfactory and it became clear that an appropriate form of smoothing was required .",
    "if each cmd is thought of as an estimated density distribution , then the difference between a cluster field cmd and a control field cmd becomes the difference between two estimated density distributions . as advised by silverman ( 1986 ) , we first smoothed the cmds with an epanechnikov kernel .",
    "the epanechnikov kernel is an inverted parabola that places the peak density at the object position and zero density at plus and minus the kernel width .",
    "this smoothing was performed using software kindly provided by k. gebhardt ( for examples of its use in astronomy see gebhardt et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "we tried a variety of epanechnikov kernel sizes ( smoothing lengths ) , ranging from 0.01 mag to 1.0 mag and found that 0.10 mag represented the best compromise between maintaining the original resolution of the cmds and smoothing the cmds enough so that the subtraction did not contain too much high frequency noise .",
    "a slight complication in the cmd subtraction was that the comparison field is slightly less reddened than the cluster field .",
    "this difference was unsurprising given the known variable reddening in the vicinity of the cluster .",
    "the decreased reddening in the comparison field relative to the central field was measured by fitting the blue edge of the field stars in the cmd in three different magnitude ranges .",
    "we estimate the reddening difference to be @xmath81e(@xmath6 ) = 0.05 .",
    "although this reddening difference is almost certainly spread out in distance along the line of sight , we approximate it as a single value for all stars in the comparison field , and apply a single offset in color and luminosity to the control field cmds . small errors in this reddening offset and the limitations of using a single reddening value",
    "will make our subtraction process noisier , but will not meaningfully affect the location of the derived fiducial cluster sequences .",
    "note that alternative explanations for the color offset between the cluster and comparison fields , e.g. ,  due to stellar population differences , are unlikely .",
    "these two fields are near enough to one other that the galactic model of reid & majewski ( 1993 ) yielded essentially identical cmds for both fields . additionally , the @xmath3 cmd for the comparison field had slightly more stars than its counterpart for the cluster , 1554 stars versus 1463 stars , despite the fact that the comparison field is at a slightly higher galactic latitude , @xmath59 = 2.30 versus @xmath59 = 2.17 .",
    "the excess is primarily at the bottom of the cmd , past @xmath82 , consistent with expectations of less absorption for this field .",
    "figure 3a presents a smoothed ( kernel = 0.10 mag ) @xmath3 cmd for the central cluster field and figure 3b presents a similar @xmath3 cmd for the control field , artificially reddened by e(@xmath6 ) = 0.05 .",
    "figure 3c presents the subtracted cmd . for figures 3a through 3c",
    "the horizontal axes are @xmath7 color from 0.0 to 4.5 and the vertical axes are @xmath4 magnitude from 15 to 26 .",
    "figure 3c also presents the best fit fiducial sequence as a white line .",
    "the fiducial sequence has been shifted downward by 0.30 mag for presentation purposes , to make it easier to visually identify the cluster main sequence . while there is some subtraction noise elsewhere in the cmd , seen as black points which are negative star counts , the cluster main sequence is almost entirely positive . due to the limited statistical significance of the presence of the main sequence above @xmath83 in these wiyn data ,",
    "the fiducial sequence above that limit was derived from the wide - field 0.9 m data ( deliyannis et al .",
    "2002 ) , and checked for consistency in these data .",
    "we created similar smoothed and subtracted @xmath2 cmds .",
    "we extracted the cluster fiducial main sequence from the @xmath3 ( figure 3c ) and @xmath2 subtracted density maps by identifying peaks in the main sequence region . because of the small number of stars involved we found it easiest to first identify the main sequence by eye , then statistically validate and improve our choice of main sequence location by computing star counts in regions around the nominal fiducial sequence .",
    "star counts determined in regions around the correct main sequence location should asymptote to a constant value after a sensible extraction width has been reached since only in the main sequence region should there be excess star counts in the difference maps .",
    "to demonstrate this point , the solid curve cutting through the circles in figure 4 presents the cumulative number of stars extracted along the entire @xmath4-band magnitude range ( 19.82 @xmath84 24.62 ) of our initial wiyn @xmath3 fiducial sequence as a function of the width of the extraction window .",
    "the smallest extraction window considered was @xmath85 mag , i.e. ,  along the 0.01 width of this fiducial sequence .",
    "the largest window considered was @xmath86 mag , for a total width of 1.01 mag .",
    "once the window width reached 0.29 mag ( @xmath87 mag around the fiducial sequence ) the total number of stars in the lf remained constant , at 47 .",
    "the quality of the subtraction around the main sequence region remains good even with a window width as large as @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) mag . besides the curve indicating cumulative star counts around the initial fiducial sequence as a function of @xmath7 window width , a series of other curves are plotted , each for a different fiducial sequence created by offsetting the initial fiducial sequence by @xmath90 , 0.05 , 0.075 , 0.10 , and 0.125 mags .",
    "the @xmath91 mag offset ( redward ) represents a slight improvement over our initial fiducial sequence , and we adopt this improvement for our best estimate of m35 s fiducial sequence .",
    "figure 4 also serves to yield an overall @xmath7 error in the fiducial sequence : the five curves containing the most stars within the smallest color range present the reasonable range of the best fit , yielding an overall uncertainty in the fiducial sequence of @xmath92 .",
    "the identical procedure was used for the @xmath2 cluster fiducial , where we found a color uncertainty , @xmath93 .",
    "while our procedure does not justify the subtle wiggles in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 fiducial sequences , it does justify the overall fiducial location , particularly for @xmath94 , where the bulk of the cluster stars are found , and where we will focus our comparison with stellar models in the next section .    for presentation purposes and as a consistency check on the cluster distance",
    ", we extended the wiyn fiducial sequences to brighter stars ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) , using the 0.9 m photometry of deliyannis et al .",
    "the bright fiducial sequences are estimated by eye without the aid of the cmd subtraction technique discussed above .",
    "we estimate the errors in the bright fiducial fits to be @xmath990.15 mag in @xmath4 for a given @xmath6 or @xmath7 color , for @xmath100 . in the overlap region , between @xmath4 = 17 and 20 , where the 0.9 m data are not as precise and where the wiyn data contains fewer cluster stars , the error is approximately @xmath101 mag .",

    "the upper part of the fiducial sequence , assuming our adopted cluster parameters , is compared in figure 5 to the hipparcos cluster fiducial main sequence derived by pinsonneault et al .",
    "the hipparcos fiducial is based on five nearby open clusters ( @xmath105 per , coma ber , hyades , pleiades , and praesepe ) and valid over the range @xmath106 .",
    "although pinsonneault et al .  find a systematic problem with the pleiades parallaxes , they argue that the other four open clusters are consistent with the same fiducial sequence within very stringent limits . they conclude that with good data one can derive the distance to a near solar metallicity open cluster using the main - sequence fitting technique to an accuracy in the distance modulus of @xmath107 mag .",
    "the correction away from solar metallicity to the cluster metallicity , [ fe / h ] = @xmath108 ( barrado y navascus et al .",

    "at least part of the cluster - to - model mismatch appears to be underestimated opacity in the bluer bandpasses , with the amount of missing opacity increasing toward the blue ( @xmath139 already includes the excess @xmath4-band opacity apparent in @xmath140 ) .",
    "more generally , at low temperatures , both the model radii and the color transformations between the theoretical @xmath141-@xmath131 plane and the observational plane are still uncertain , due to the unphysical parameterization of convection ( mixing length theory ) and deficiencies in current model atmospheres ( particularly molecular transition data ) , respectively .",
    "we look forward to developments in these theories and more sophisticated models that fully treat radiative hydrodynamics .      the steps used to derive the @xmath3 fiducial sequence from the subtracted @xmath3 cmd density map were essentially the same as deriving the cluster luminosity function .",
    "the process of shifting the comparison field slightly to correct for its lower reddening , smoothing the cmds , subtracting the smoothed control field cmd from the cluster field cmd , and identifying and statistically validating the location of the cluster main sequence , leads us to the point where we need only extract the number of stars in the differenced cmd along the main sequence .",
    "the only parameter in question for the luminosity function was the appropriate width along the main sequence . in theory",
    "the best extraction width might vary as a function of magnitude since the photometric errors increase toward the bottom of the cmd and since the main sequence slope changes with luminosity . in practice , because the comparison and cluster fields were closely matched in the properties of the field stars and the photometric depth , the width of the extraction window did not matter , at least within a reasonable range .",
    "the insensitivity of the total star counts in the lf ( from 19.82 @xmath84 24.62 ) versus the extraction window width ( figure 4 ) demonstrates this point .",
    "once the window width reached 0.29 mag ( @xmath87 mag around the fiducial sequence ) the total number of stars in the lf remained constant , at 47 . in order to test for any signature due to equal mass binary main sequence stars at @xmath142 mag above the main sequence , we chose an extraction width of 0.15 mag ( @xmath143 mag ) around a locus offset by @xmath144 mag .",
    "this extraction width kept the equal mass binary window from overlapping the main sequence extraction window . one untreated systematic in this procedure was the effect of removing real cluster stars by using a conservative stellarity index .",
    "fortunately , as figure 1 illustrates , real cluster stars may be missed only for @xmath145 , which is beyond the limit of the main sequence luminosity function we extract ( to @xmath146 ) .    as a final nuance to the derived cluster lf",

    "does not pose a problem in our analysis .",
    "instead , we use m35 s lf to demonstrate the reality of our cluster fiducial sequence by showing that we have actually found cluster stars along this sequence and to demonstrate that the cluster contains very low mass stars to the limit of our photometry , just slightly above the brown dwarf regime .",
