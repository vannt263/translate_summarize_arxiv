    "understanding the interplay between thermal and quantum fluctuations in quantum systems is an exciting challenge to theory .",

    "we concentrate on lifetimes of quasiparticles , or , more generally , on line - shapes of spectral functions . the lifetime and the spectral function are essentially non - equilibrium properties in spite of the fact that the entire many - body system that we consider is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "a perturbative treatment of quasiparticles in a hot dense medium becomes plagued by infrared divergences that occur due to the medium . in this paper",
    "we develop and present a relatively simple technique that i ) regulates the infrared behavior via a resummation of medium effects i.e. the self - consistent inclusion of line - shapes , and ii ) allows one to handle the calculation of non - equilibrium responses at finite temperature .",
    "the problem we investigate was stimulated by the observation of paramagnons in the magnetically disordered phase of the three dimensional ( 3d ) , dimerized quantum antiferromagnet tlcucl@xmath0  @xcite .",

    "the quantum phase transition at the quantum critical point ( qcp ) @xmath1kbar is driven by external hydrostatic pressure . the red line in fig.[pd ] shows the nel temperature versus pressure  @xcite . at @xmath2 and temperatures below the nel curve ,",
    "the compound possesses long range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "going above the nel curve at @xmath3 , the system becomes magnetically disordered , while at @xmath4 the system is disordered even at zero temperature .",
    "magnetic excitations at zero temperature and at @xmath4 are usually called triplons , while magnetic excitations at @xmath2 and @xmath5 are usually called paramagnons .",

    "the long lifetime of magnons , @xmath10 , is due to adler s theorem which claims that the magnon - magnon interaction must vanish in the long wave - length limit .",
