    "the established evidence that neutrinos oscillate and possess small masses  @xcite necessitates physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , which could manifest itself at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) and/or in low energy experiments which search for the lepton flavour violation  @xcite .",

    "neutrinos may obtain mass via the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a neutral higgs boson in an isospin triplet representation  @xcite .",
    "a particularly simple implementation of this mechanism of neutrino mass generation is the `` higgs triplet model '' ( htm ) in which the sm lagrangian is augmented solely by @xmath10 which is a @xmath1 triplet of scalar particles with hypercharge @xmath11  @xcite . in the htm , the majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is given by the product of a triplet yukawa coupling matrix @xmath14 and a triplet vev ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "consequently , the direct connection between @xmath14 and @xmath12 gives rise to phenomenological predictions for processes which depend on @xmath14 because @xmath16 has been restricted well by neutrino oscillation measurements  @xcite .",
    "a distinctive signal of the htm would be the observation of doubly charged higgs bosons ( @xmath0 ) whose mass ( @xmath17 ) may be of the order of the electroweak scale .",
    "such particles can be produced with sizeable rates at hadron colliders in the processes @xmath4  @xcite and @xmath18  @xcite .",

    "this possibility has been mentioned in the context of the htm in @xcite only .",
    "we will perform the first study of the magnitude of its branching ratio , as well as quantify its contribution to the production of @xmath0 at the lhc . has also been briefly mentioned in @xcite in the context of a model with an isospin 3/2 multiplet with hypercharge @xmath35 , which also includes triply charged higgs bosons . ] the decay rate for @xmath2 is easily obtained from the corresponding expression for the decay rate for @xmath31 , and thus one expects that @xmath2 will be sizeable over a wide range of values of @xmath32 and @xmath15 .",
