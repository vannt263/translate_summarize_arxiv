    "thereby , the image - polyion _ repulsive _ interactions [ including the self - image repulsion as well as the lateral image - ion correlations as given by the second term of eq . ] scale like @xmath93 whereas the _ attractive _ driving force of polyion adsorption due to wigner crystal ordering scales like @xmath94 @xcite .",

    "hence , we think that our results will not qualitatively differ from the more realistic situation of non - smeared - out substrate charges consisting of discrete monovalent ions .",
    "an other approximation in our model is the location of the dielectric discontinuity .",

    "in fact , experimentally , it is not clear where the dielectric discontinuity is located and the transition is rather gradual and spreads out over several angstrms @xcite , so that in a continuum description the dielectric discontinuity might be located somewhat below the _ hard _ interface . in this",
    "respect our model tends to slightly overestimate the effect of image forces and namely , with @xmath63 , the self - image _",
    "repulsion_. furthermore , in the presence of _ short - range _ attractive interactions between the substrate and the pes ( for instance stemming from some specific chemical properties of the chains and the substrate , i.e. chemisorption ) , the effect of image charges might also be reduced @xcite .",
