    "dynamical studies of local galaxies over the past decade have firmly established that supermassive black holes ( bhs ) are present in most ( possibly all ) galaxies with massive bulges , and that the black hole mass tightly correlates with bulge mass and stellar velocity dispersion @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "these correlations suggest coeval growth of the galaxy bulge and the central bh .",
    "the @xmath2  relation is important both as a fundamental benchmark against which galaxy evolution models are tested @xcite , and as a key input to calculations of the density of black holes in the universe @xcite .",
    "the low - mass end of the mass function locally is where models of primordial bh seed formation show pronounced differences , thus improving the observational constraints on the low - mass end of the @xmath2  relation can provide important constraints on the models .",
    "theoretical work has proposed two types of seed models : `` light seeds '' @xcite formed as remnants of population stars , and `` heavy seeds '' @xcite from direct collapse of massive gas clouds in primordial halos . these different classes of models should result in different demographics for bhs in low - mass galaxies at the present epoch .",
    "low - mass seeds lead to a wide scatter in bh masses in low - dispersion galaxies ( with some galaxies hosting very low - mass bhs ) but a relatively high occupation fraction of bhs in low - mass galaxies , while in a heavy seed scenario , the bh occupation fraction is low but the minimum bh mass is larger @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , observations have not yet been sufficiently sensitive to distinguish between these scenarios , and additional observations to constrain the @xmath2  relation at low masses are needed .",
    "empirically , the slope and scatter of the @xmath2  relation are still subject to debate , particularly at the low and high mass ends @xcite .",
    "there is some recent work that suggests that the relation may be different for different types of host galaxies , i.e. , for barred vs.  unbarred galaxies , and for classical bulges vs.  pseudo - bulges @xcite .",
    "these differences may be more pronounced at lower masses and cause scatter in the overall @xmath2  relation . however , due to the difficulty of obtaining direct stellar - dynamical measurements of bh masses in low - mass galaxies , much of the information on bh demographics at low mass comes from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "recent _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) imaging of low - mass seyfert 1 galaxies selected from the sdss by @xcite also shows some evidence for a change in the @xmath13relation at low mass , probably indicative of a different mode of bh growth in these objects compared with higher - mass galaxies having classical bulges @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "our goal is to expand the sample of low - mass agns having both black hole mass estimates from single - epoch spectroscopy and direct measurements of stellar velocity dispersion , in order to investigate the low - mass end of the @xmath2  relation in more detail than was possible previously .",

    "* for related work ) .",
    "the @xmath9  for the gh07 sample could not be determined from the sdss spectra , because the instrumental resolution of @xmath15 70 km  s@xmath16  sets a practical lower limit to the @xmath9  that could be measured , and also because the @xmath17 of the sdss spectra was insufficient or the continuum was dominated by agn emission rather than by starlight . here",
    "we present new measurements of @xmath9  for objects in the gh07 sample .",
    "these new measurements provide a useful way to examine bh demographics , even if the individual bh masses are not highly accurate .",
    "in addition , our work provides a very large sample to examine relationships between gas and stellar kinematics for nearby agns .",
    "we present the sample properties , observations , and data reduction in section  [ sec : obsdata ] , and measurements of @xmath9  and line - width in section  [ sec : meas ] .",

    "the objects observed at keck and magellan were selected from the sample of low - mass bhs presented by @xcite .",
    "they selected 229 broad - line active galaxies with @xmath18 from sdss dr4 .",
    "they estimated the bh masses with the single - epoch virial method , using the full width half maximum ( @xmath19 ) and luminosity of the broad h@xmath20  emission line , following the methods first described by @xcite .",
    "the virial calculation determines the radius of the broad - line region ( blr ) using the radius - luminosity relationship of @xcite .",

    "flux standards and late - type giant stars ( f4m0 ) for use as velocity templates were observed during each night .",
    "details of the keck and magellan observations and reductions are given below .",
    "we obtained useful data for 65 of 66 objects observed with mage  and for 13 objects observed with esi ; two objects were observed with both esi  and mage .",
    "we also combine our new sample with the 17 similar objects previously presented by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bgh05 ) . including the bgh05 sample , our total sample consists of 93 low - mass sdss agns .",
    "esi   observations with esi  at keck were made during the nights of 2008 march 12 ut .",
    "we used a 075 slit width , resulting in an instrumental dispersion of @xmath21 km  s@xmath16 . the spectra cover the wavelength range 380010900   across 10 echelle orders , and",
    "the dispersion is a constant 11.5 km  s@xmath16pixel@xmath16  in velocity .",
    "the exposure times for individual objects ranged from 900s to 3000s .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were extracted within a 1  extraction width , and wavelength- and flux - calibrated , with correction for telluric absorption bands , using standard techniques following the same methods we have previously used for esi data ( bgh05 ) .",
    "mage   observations with mage  at the magellan ii clay telescope were carried out on the nights of 2008 april 913 , 2008 august 2830 , and 2009 january 2527 ut , using a 1  slit width , giving an instrumental dispersion of @xmath22 km  s@xmath16 , as measured from the arc lamp spectra .",
    "the spectral coverage is approximately 320010000   across 15 echelle orders , with a nearly constant dispersion of 23 km  s@xmath16  pixel@xmath16 .",
    "exposure times ranged from 18007200 s and were typically 5400 s. one - dimensional spectra were extracted from the ccd images and wavelength - calibrated using the ` mage_reduce `  package kindly provided by george becker .",
    "the extraction width is typically 15 to 3 .",
    "the ` mage_reduce`package uses techniques for rectification and sky subtraction developed by @xcite .",
    "optimal extractions @xcite were used for exposures of the bright stars , while for the galaxies a simple boxcar extraction was used in order to avoid spurious clipping of emission lines that can sometimes occur with optimal extractions .",
    "flux calibration and telluric absorption correction were applied using the same methods used for the esi data .",
    "finally , cosmic rays were removed when combining multiple exposures .",
    "two objects , sdss j093147.25 + 063503.2 and sdss j131310.12 + 051942.1 , were observed with both esi  and mage , allowing a direct comparison of the spectra ; see figure  [ fig : spec2 ] . to facilitate comparison ,",
    "the esi  data have been re - binned to the spectral resolution of the mage  data , and all the spectra have been re - scaled to have flux density of unity at 5100  .",
    "the keck and magellan spectra appear consistent across the entire available wavelength range , which illustrates the consistency of the flux calibration , except for differences in the emission lines , which are expected due to the difference in instrumental dispersion of the two instruments . for sdss j093147.25 + 063503.2",
    ", the difference spectrum reveals significant residuals only in the peaks of the narrow emission lines , most likely resulting from the difference in instrumental dispersion . for sdss j131310.12 + 051942.1 , there is also evidence of some flux variation between the 2 observations .",
    "this could result from the different aperture size and different seeing between the two exposures , but could also be in part due to real variability of the continuum and broad emission lines .",
    "however , the time interval between these two observations is 329 days , and on such a short timescale the narrow lines probably would not be variable .",
    "since there are residuals in the narrow lines in figure  [ fig : spec2 ] as well as the broad lines , the main cause is probably aperture size and seeing .",
    "the stellar velocity dispersions were measured by a direct fitting method @xcite , in which the spectra of velocity template stars are broadened and fitted to the galaxy spectra locally in a specific spectral region .",
    "a gaussian profile was assumed as the line - of - sight velocity distribution .",
    "we follow @xcite and @xcite and express the fitted model spectrum , @xmath23 , as @xmath24 + c(x)\\ } p(x ) , \\label{eq : ctmmodel}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the stellar template spectrum , @xmath26 is the gaussian broadening function , @xmath27 represents a featureless continuum , and @xmath28 is a polynomial factor . since our fits are performed across a small wavelength region , we adopt a quadratic polynomial for @xmath27 , which could also account for some other additive components , such as the `` pseudo - continuum '' due to emission originating from blr of agn .",
    "the low - order multiplicative polynomial @xmath29 allows for the differences between the template and the galaxy , including continuum shape , reddening in the galaxy spectrum , and wavelength - dependent flux calibration errors .",
    "we use a quadratic polynomial for @xmath29 , since higher - order polynomials will tend to fit the absorption features and adversely affect the dispersion measurements @xcite .",
    "besides the velocity dispersion and six parameters for these two polynomials , the redshift of the galaxy is also a free parameter .",
    "we determined the best - fit parameters by minimizing @xmath30 , using the levenberg - marquardt least - squares fitting routine provided by the ` mpfit ` package in idl @xcite .",
    "our collection of stellar templates includes 19 g and k giant stars observed with esi  and 22 f , g , k and m giant stars observed with mage . for each galaxy ,",
    "we inspect the fitting and discard the templates that fail to fit",
    ". then we list the @xmath30  of the remaining templates in ascending order , and select the first two - thirds to be well - fit templates . the measured velocity dispersion derived with the best - fitting template ( minimum @xmath30 ) is adopted to be the best estimate of @xmath9 .",
    "generally , the best fits were obtained with k - giant templates . the uncertainty in measurement",
    "is calculated as the quadrature sum of the fitting uncertainty of the best - fit template and the standard deviation of the measurements of all the selected templates .",
    "a minimum of six templates are used in each calculation , except for several objects , marked by `` : '' behind the value of @xmath9  in table  [ table1 ] , that were not well fit by six or more templates . in these cases ,",
    "all the results of well - fit templates will be accounted in estimating the uncertainty .",
    "the spectral region around the @xmath31 triplet ( @xmath32  , hereafter the cat region ) is ideal for measuring velocity dispersions because the cat lines are strong , not blended with other strong lines , and relatively insensitive to stellar population variations .",
    "they are also less strongly diluted by agn continuum contamination than stellar features at blue wavelengths . however , for objects with redshift higher than 0.05 , the cat absorption features can be affected by both night sky emission residuals and telluric absorption bands , making it difficult to obtain useful measurements .",
    "stellar features at bluer wavelengths are unaffected by telluric absorption , and we also carried out measurements in the @xmath33  region ( @xmath34  ) and the `` fe region '' ( @xmath35  ) redward of @xmath33  for measurements , following @xcite and @xcite . @xcite ran a series of simulations to evaluate the contamination of narrow emission lines , including [ ] @xmath36  , [ ] @xmath37  , and [ ] @xmath38  , around the @xmath33  features , as well as the pseudo - continuum of broad extending in this region .",
    "they found that the fe region containing strong absorption features resulted in better recovery of @xmath9 , since it includes less contamination by coronal emission lines .",
    "we tested these two regions by fitting stellar templates to a set of simulated spectra , composed as a linear combination of a k2 star , an a0 star , and a featureless linear continuum .",
    "the combined spectra were then broadened by a gaussian velocity - broadening kernel with width ranging from @xmath39 to 100 km  s@xmath16  in increments of 10 km  s@xmath16 .",
    "slight variations in the shape of the spectra , representing calibration errors and random errors , were imposed on the broadened model spectra , and the models were degraded to @xmath40 , 30 , 50 , and 100 per pixel .",
    "we also redshifted the model spectra by an arbitrary value comparable to the redshifts our observed sample .",
    "then the modeled spectra were fitted using the methods described above , and the measured @xmath9  was compared with the input value .",
    "we find , for @xmath41/\\sigma(\\textrm{input})$ ] , that @xmath42 from the @xmath33region and @xmath43 from the fe region for @xmath44 , the median @xmath17 for our observed sample .",
    "reassuringly , the results from these test measurements are consistent with input values .",
    "we find that the scatter in results from the @xmath33  region is larger than that from fe region .",
    "the scatter for both fitting regions decreases with increasing @xmath17 , to 0.04 and 0.01 for @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the larger scatter of the @xmath33  region might be attributed to template mismatch .",
    "we checked the template spectra and found that for different types of stars , the variations in the width of the @xmath33  lines are slightly larger than the width variations for the features . for different type of stars , for example , in the sequence of g8 @xmath46 k3 @xmath46 k5 , the @xmath33  line widths increase , while fe absorption widths are consistent ; this may explain at least in part why the dispersion measurements obtained from the @xmath33region have larger scatter .    in practice ,",
    "when fitting to actual galaxy spectra , we excluded wavelength regions covering emission lines including [ ] @xmath38   and the high - ionization fe lines .",
    "the majority of the objects have several high - ionization fe lines , including [ ] @xmath36  , [ ] @xmath37  , [ ] @xmath47  , [ ] @xmath48   and [ ] @xmath49  .",
    "we tested model fits that excluded and included the @xmath33  absorption features themselves , and found that the best - fit template could generally fit the @xmath33  features well for galaxies not dominated by agn fe emission .",
    "this is because most objects in this sample have relatively low @xmath9 , so the mismatch of [ mg / fe ] abundance ratio that sometimes affects template fits to elliptical galaxies with high @xmath9  @xcite is apparently not a significant issue for this sample .    in order to avoid issues of mismatch in flux calibration or spectral resolution across echelle orders , we prefer to measure velocity dispersions from a single echelle order ( rather than from multiple orders that have been `` stitched '' together ) , and the specific fitting region for each individual galaxy",
    "was adjusted to remain within one echelle order . for mage",
    "data , we first measured @xmath9  from both the @xmath33  region and the fe region individually .",
    "we found that if these two regions are in the same order , we obtained highly consistent results from both regions .",
    "this is partly due to the limited wavelength range of each order for mage  data and the fact that there is substantial overlap between the @xmath33  and fe regions .",
    "therefore , if these two are on the same order for a given galaxy , we carry out a single fit extending across both of these regions , and list the result as @xmath9(@xmath33 ) in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "when a separate value is listed in the @xmath9(fe ) column of the table , this denotes that the @xmath33  and fe regions fell in adjacent echelle orders and were fitted separately .",
    "figure  [ fig : vdisp ] illustrates some examples of both esi  and mage  spectra in the fe and cat regions .",
    "we were able to obtain useful measurements of @xmath9  for 56 of the 76 newly observed galaxies .",
    "the two galaxies with both esiand mage  observations have consistent velocity dispersions within the uncertainty measured by two instruments .",
    "the remaining 20 galaxies are either dominated by agn emission or have @xmath17 too low to permit a successful fit .",
    "we also re - measured @xmath9  for 15 of the 17 objects from bgh05 ( excluding the two objects from that sample that were highly agn - dominated ) .",
    "the results are consistent with the bgh05 measurements , within the uncertainties . if we define the deviation between our new measurements and bgh05 both from the @xmath33  region , as @xmath50 , the mean value of @xmath51 is less than 0.001 dex and the rms difference is only 0.02 dex .",
    "all of the @xmath9  measurements are summarized in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "for the galaxies with more than one measurement of @xmath9  from different fitting regions , the corresponding results are mostly consistent within the uncertainties .",
    "we take the average of the available measurements as the best estimate of the stellar velocity dispersion in each object , and list as @xmath9 in table  [ table1 ] .      to decompose the h@xmath20 + [ ]  lines",
    ", we first subtracted the underlying continuum .",
    "the continuum model is essentially the same as that in equation  [ eq : ctmmodel ] used to measure @xmath9 , but fitted over the spectral region surrounding h@xmath20 , covering the rest - frame region 61007100  . for this model spectrum ( @xmath23 in equation  [ eq : ctmmodel ] ) ,",
    "the velocity dispersion was constrained to lie within three times the @xmath52 uncertainties around the measured velocity dispersion as described in the preceding section .",
    "emission lines were masked out from the calculation of @xmath30 for the fits .",
    "the continuum fits were carried out on spectra in which the echelle orders were `` stitched '' together , since in some cases the h@xmath20  line falls near the end of an echelle order .",
    "the best - fit continuum model was then subtracted from the spectra to yield a pure emission - line spectrum .",
    "we used multiple - gaussian models to fit the h@xmath20  and [ ] lines as well as [ ] @xmath53  .",
    "we followed @xcite , using a multi - component gaussian fit to the [ ] doublet to model other blended lines .",
    "up to 4 gaussians were used to model the [ ] doublet .",
    "the velocities and widths of the two [ ] lines were constrained to be the same , while the intensity ratio was allowed to vary . for objects with very weak or absent [ ] emission",
    ", we used the core of the [ ] @xmath12   line as the narrow - line model instead .",
    "the [ ] doublet lines were constrained to have their relative rest - frame wavelengths and intensity ratio fixed to their laboratory values of 35.42   and 2.96 , respectively .",
    "we then fit as many gaussian components to the broad component of h@xmath20  as needed to achieve an acceptable fit : starting with a single gaussian model , new components were added one at a time if they resulted in 20% decrease in @xmath30 .",
    "generally , one or two gaussians proved sufficient to fit the broad h@xmath20  emission adequately .",
    "figure  [ fig : linefit ] shows some examples of fits to h@xmath20 . only a small number of galaxies with asymmetric profiles or very broad wings required a third gaussian component . in most cases we were able to achieve an acceptable fit to the h@xmath20 + [ ]  blend , but there are a few cases ( @xmath54 ) for which no acceptable fit to the narrow h@xmath20  line could be obtained with the [ ] model . for those cases , we relaxed the width constrains on the narrow lines . in each case , the width of the narrow h@xmath20  in the best - fit model remained quite close to the [ ] line width but the h@xmath20  fit was significantly improved by allowing its width to be a free parameter .",
    "we also modeled the h@xmath55  + [ ] region in continuum - subtracted spectra , in the rest - frame range of 4800 - 5150  , following procedures similar to those described above for the h@xmath20 + [ ]  region .",
    "we used double - gaussian models for the broad component of h@xmath55  as well as for [ ] , for which the double gaussians represent a wing and a core component .",
    "the corresponding components in the two [ ] lines are constrained to have the same velocity width , and the wavelength separations and intensity ratios are fixed at their laboratory values . for those galaxies with significant broad emission ( mainly @xmath56  ) , we adopted an analytical model for the broad lorentzian system `` l1 '' in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their appendix a ) .",
    "each line was fitted with a lorentzian profile , allowing the line center to vary within a small range around the expected value to account for shifting from the systemic redshift .",
    "the widths of both lines were constrained to be the same , while their flux ratio was allowed to vary . in order to model the narrow h@xmath55 , we follow @xcite to use the profile of [ ] . the h@xmath55  centroid was fixed to the relative wavelength of narrow h@xmath20if necessary , and its flux was limited to be no larger than the value for case b recombination ( h@xmath20  = 3.1h@xmath55 , * ? ? ?",
    "the procedure produced acceptable fit to h@xmath55  in most cases , except for some objects ( @xmath57 ) in which the profile of [ ] seems not be a good model for narrow h@xmath55 , possibly resulting from small changes in spectral resolution across different echelle orders of the spectra . in these cases",
    "we used a single gaussian to model narrow h@xmath55 , and we relaxed the width and flux constraints . in figure",
    "[ fig : linefit ] we show some examples of best - fit models for the h@xmath55  + [ ] region .",
    "individual components for emission are also shown if they are present .",
    "it turns out that the detected lines in this sample are relatively narrow , typically 700 km  s@xmath16  @xmath19 , significantly narrower than the commonly used template i zw 1 , whose broad line system `` l1 '' has @xmath58 km  s@xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19  of the overall profile of broad h@xmath20  is used for tracing the velocity dispersion of gas in the blr , in the close environment of the black hole .",
    "we continue to use the @xmath19(h@xmath20 ) as a measurement of the line width for the whole sample in a consistent way , because the commonly used h@xmath55  lines suffer from low @xmath17 .",
    "broad h@xmath55  is often weak and sometimes not even detectable for objects in our sample .    to estimate errors on the line width measurements",
    ", we should include statistical uncertainties from profile fits caused by noise and other random errors from spectral extraction and calibration , and uncertainties in continuum subtraction and deblending of broad components from narrow emission lines .",
    "in general , the formal fitting uncertainties from the profile fits are quite small , typically only 11 km  s@xmath16 .",
    "since the broad lines for this low - mass sample are narrow ( mostly with @xmath19  @xmath59 2000 km  s@xmath16 ) , the measurements of widths are much less affected by continuum subtraction than broad - lined agn ( see section  2.5 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . due to the small wavelength range over which the continuum - subtraction fits were performed and the good quality of the fits , the continuum subtraction does not add substantially to the error budget for the line widths",
    ". to explore the uncertainty from the emission - line profile deblending in more detail",
    ", we create a set of artificial spectra from the best - fit model , following @xcite . for each galaxy",
    ", we created a realization of the combined emission lines from the best - fit model parameters , and added gaussian noise to match the @xmath17 of the data .",
    "the artificial spectra created this way suffer from the same deblending difficulty as the original data .",
    "then the artificial spectra are fitted with multiple - gaussian models using the fitting procedure described above .",
    "the difference between the model and measured @xmath19(h@xmath20 ) is typically @xmath60 ( or 0.02 dex ) . with these artificial spectra",
    ", we also investigated the uncertainty associated with the choice of model for the narrow - line profile , which often dominates the uncertainty in the decomposition of narrow / broad lines .",
    "we substituted the narrow - line model with the [ ] profile , the core of [ ] , and narrow h@xmath55 respectively , in the fitting procedure with the multiple - gaussian model above .",
    "the typical standard deviation in the @xmath19  of broad h@xmath20  is @xmath61 ( or 0.03 dex ) .",
    "these two sources of error are combined to be typically @xmath62 ( or 0.04 dex ) , and taken as the estimated uncertainty of @xmath19(h@xmath20 ) .",
    "it is instructive to compare our broad h@xmath20  measurements with those obtained from sdss spectra by gh07 .",
    "the smaller spectroscopic apertures for the keck and magellan data result in a smaller degree of starlight dilution of the agn features , and the higher spectral resolution of the new data should permit more accurate deblending of the emission lines .",
    "thus , we expect that the keck and magellan data should generally yield more accurate measurements of the broad h@xmath20widths , particularly for very weak h@xmath20  emission lines .",
    "the sdss spectra , on the other hand , have a more reliable flux calibration . in a small fraction of the objects from the gh07 sample ,",
    "the broad h@xmath20emission in the sdss spectra is so weak that it is uncertain whether a distinct broad component is genuinely present or not , and our new spectra are particularly useful for testing the reality of these features tentatively seen in the sdss data .",
    "we examined how our new measurements of the broad h@xmath20  @xmath19compare with the results that gh07 obtained from fitting sdss spectra , to test whether the objects with very weak broad h@xmath20  in gh07 s low - mass agn sample were genuine seyfert 1 galaxies or not .",
    "we visually inspected the best - fit models for all the objects and divided them into two categories : objects with `` definite '' and `` possible '' broad h@xmath20 . in the following we refer to the two sub - categories as the @xmath63 and @xmath64 sub - samples , as indicated in table  [ table1 ] . for the @xmath63 sample ,",
    "the wings of broad h@xmath20generally extend beyond the [ ] emission lines , and the broad h@xmath20  is significantly wider than the narrow emission lines such as [ ] .",
    "we classified objects as belonging to the @xmath64 subsample if the peak amplitude of broad h@xmath20  was less than twice the rms pixel - to - pixel deviation in the continuum - subtracted spectrum in the region surrounding h@xmath20 , or if the ratio of the flux of broad h@xmath20  to the rms deviation of the continuum - subtracted spectrum was below 200 .",
    "some examples of `` possible '' broad h@xmath20are shown in figure  [ fig : broadha ] .    among the 93 galaxies in our sample , 14 ( 15% , 1 galaxy observed both by esi  and mage ) had ambiguous `` possible '' broad h@xmath20emission . to investigate whether this was simply due to these 15 spectra having low @xmath17 , we examined the average @xmath17 in the h@xmath20 + [ ] region , and found that only three @xmath64 objects had very low @xmath17 of @xmath65 .",
    "overall , the objects classified as being in the @xmath64 category have a median @xmath17 of 25 , compared to a median value of 40 for our whole sample , so some of the @xmath64 objects may simply be suffering from low @xmath17 . however , some of the @xmath64 objects have very high @xmath17 spectra , so we can not attribute all the cases of ambiguity in broad h@xmath20  to low @xmath17 . there are six @xmath64 objects which only show very weak or possible broad h@xmath20  in the sdss spectra ( these are denoted as the @xmath66 subsample in gh07 ) . the other 8 out of the 14 @xmath64 galaxies are classified as broad - line agns by gh07 .",
    "the difference between the sdss results and our new fitting results could possibly be due to intrinsic agn variability or variable agn obscuration . among the eight @xmath64 galaxies ,",
    "sdss j093147.25 + 063503.2 is confirmed to have outflow components in the narrow lines , which might have mimicked part of the broad component in sdss spectra .",
    "there are also five galaxies in the @xmath66 ( `` candidate '' ) sample of gh07 which we now classify as having definite broad h@xmath20  based on our new high - resolution spectra .",
    "a likely explanation is that the better quality of our new spectra makes the decompositions more accurate and better reveals the intrinsic properties of the broad components .",
    "therefore , eight ( 9% ) out of 82 galaxies previously classified as broad - line agns by gh07 are found to have only possible broad h@xmath20  from the high - resolution spectra .",
    "this indicates the likely rate of false positive detections of broad h@xmath20  in the sdss sample for objects near the threshold of detectability for broad h@xmath20 . in our sample , there is one object , sdss j145045.54@xmath67014752.8 , showing obvious double - peaked features in narrow lines , and also a definite broad component in h@xmath20  ( see the last object of the right panel in figure  [ fig : linefit ] ) .",
    "we compare our new measurements of broad h@xmath20  fhwm to those of gh07 by defining @xmath68(h@xmath20)@xmath69(h@xmath20)@xmath70 .",

    "these two measurements are in reasonable agreement up to @xmath19  @xmath73 1000 km  s@xmath16 , but the difference increases as @xmath19  increases beyond 1000 km  s@xmath16 .",
    "this is probably because the higher resolution of the new data enables us to fit the emission lines more accurately with more complex multi - gaussian models , although some of the difference may be due to intrinsic source variability as well .",
    "in this section we discuss our method of estimating black hole masses , and investigate the @xmath2relation for our sample . in the following formulae for @xmath74 estimation , @xmath75  denotes the agn continuum luminosity @xmath76l@xmath77 at @xmath78   .",
    "the black hole mass is estimated via the virial relationship , @xmath79 , where @xmath80  is the radius of the blr , and the orbital velocity at that radius is estimated by the velocity width of the broad emission line , @xmath81 .",
    "assuming that the gas in the blr is virialized , the gas velocity traces the central mass in agn , which is dominated by the black hole within the blr radius .",
    "the broad line width can be measured with the @xmath19  or @xmath82 , which is the second moment of the profile , or the line dispersion . both have merits and difficulties @xcite .",
    "the line dispersion @xmath82 has been suggested to be a more robust and precise estimator of viral velocity when measured from the rms spectra of reverberation mapping datasets @xcite .",
    "however , it is highly sensitive to the contribution from the extended line wings , and therefore less robust in single - epoch spectra when there is blending of other emission lines on the line wings @xcite . for measurements from single - epoch data ,",
    "the @xmath19  is more commonly adopted ( see a review in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; it is sensitive to the line core and to the decomposition of the broad and narrow components , but it is relatively insensitive to the accuracy of measurement of faint extended wings on the broad - line profile .",
    "denney et al .  suggests that when the @xmath17 is lower than @xmath83 , both line width measurements would become unreliable , and line - profile fits would introduce systematic errors to single - epoch masses ( e.g. , @xmath84 dex offset in @xmath85  estimated with @xmath19 , their table 5 ) . in practice",
    ", we generally fit the broad h@xmath20  with two gaussians .",
    "this is a purely empirical procedure and no specific physical meaning is assigned to the two components separately .",
    "thus , we measure @xmath19(h@xmath20 ) from the overall profile of the gaussian components used to fit the broad component of h@xmath20 .",
    "we follow gh07 s approach ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) to calculate @xmath85 , which is estimated by using the line - width of h@xmath20  and the blr radius inferred from the broad h@xmath20  luminosity @xcite . in this work ,",

    "we update gh07 s `` recipe '' for determining bh masses with the revised @xmath86  relation presented by @xcite , who analyzed high - resolution _ hst _  images of 34 reverberation - mapped ( rm ) agns to obtain more accurate measurements of agn continuum luminosity .",
    "the revised @xmath86  relation from @xcite is @xmath87    we follow gh07 in assuming @xmath88 @xcite although we note that this @xmath89 value is not derived for any specific physical model of the blr .",

    "the sdss spectra have a more consistent flux calibration , so it is preferable to use @xmath94(h@xmath20 ) measured from the sdss data , even if this does introduce some additional uncertainty due to the fact that the h@xmath20linewidths and luminosities are measured from non - simultaneous observations .",
    "most objects in our sample are in the gh07 sample of active galaxies containing low - mass bhs , so we can obtain @xmath95  for most of our sample from gh07 . for the 5 objects in bgh05 sample that were not included in gh07 , we use the h@xmath20  luminosity @xmath95from @xcite .",

    "one particular point to consider is that our mass estimates assume a normalization factor @xmath88 for the virial masses , for consistency with gh07 and other previous work , but this is not a unique choice for @xmath89 .",
    "the virial factor has been the subject of much discussion in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and different @xmath89 values have been used in various recipes to obtain @xmath85  estimates . @xcite compared @xmath85  estimators based on different emission - line and continuum measurements and showed that systematic errors could be as large as @xmath98 dex .",
    "we would like to examine how different recipes change the @xmath85values of our sample and the @xmath2  relation that will be discussed in section  [ sec : msigma ] .",
    "most of the recipes make use of continuum luminosity , but we lack direct measurements of the optical agn continuum luminosity for our sample .",
    "an alternative way is to substitute @xmath75  with the broad h@xmath20  luminosity using the empirical relationship given by @xcite .",

    "if we use the recipe of @xcite , the masses would be higher by about 0.25 dex .",
    "the formalism presented by @xcite gives relatively larger bh mass than our estimator in the low mass end , typically about 0.6 dex higher at bh mass of @xmath99 .",
    "they calibrated their bh mass estimator by fitting the reverberation - based masses for 35 agns using the continuum luminosity and h@xmath55  @xmath19 , as @xmath100 and fixed @xmath101 to be 0.5 .",
    "their fits yield values of @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this value of @xmath55 is less than @xmath104 , which is commonly adopted for mass estimators .",
    "the 35 rm agns used in their fits mostly have bh masses in the range from @xmath105 @xmath1  to @xmath8 @xmath1 , and @xmath20 tends to compensate for the mass difference in the fitting .",
    "this results in larger bh masses in the low mass range , i.e. , for objects below about @xmath105 @xmath1 .",
    "there is some lower limit to the bh masses that we are able to detect in sdss data , due to a combination of factors .",
    "a possibly low bh occupation fraction in very low - mass galaxies would result in a low detection rate .",
    "the low luminosity of agns with small black holes makes the agns hard to detect .",
    "the host galaxy has to be bright enough to be spectroscopically targeted by sdss , and the s / n of sdss spectra is limited .",
    "moreover , the large aperture of sdss spectra can mix agn emission with regions and dilute the agn signal .",
    "since we have identified the `` definite '' broad - lined agns that have genuine broad h@xmath20  in our sample , we obtain a cleaner sample that illustrates how low we can really go in selecting objects with low @xmath85  using sdss .",

    "we will show in  [ sec : virf ] that the intrinsic scatter persists or even increases if we scale the active galaxies to follow the @xmath2relation of nearby galaxies with direct measurements of bh masses and then fit the relation for the combined sample of the active galaxies and nearby galaxies .",
    "some of the dispersion in the @xmath2  relation may result from different galaxy morphological types following different @xmath2  loci , as recent evidence has suggested @xcite .",

    "there is tentative evidence for a similar trend in the @xcite sample , whose host galaxy morphologies have been investigated by @xcite using _ hst _  images .",
    "the difference could either be due to unaccounted systematic error in the @xmath85  measurements for spirals , or because the scatter in @xmath85for spirals is actually larger , as might happen if the behavior of bhs hosted by pseudobulges ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) and classical bulges are different . this has been suggested by @xcite , who found that pseudobulges tend to host lower @xmath85  than classical bulges at a given @xmath9 .",
    "similarly , a recent study by @xcite presents stellar velocity dispersions for a sample of nine megamaser disk galaxies with accurately measured bh masses in the range of @xmath146 @xmath1 .",
    "they find that the maser galaxies fall below the @xmath2relation of elliptical galaxies defined by @xcite .",
    "based on morphology and stellar population properties , they speculate that most of the nine megamaser galaxies are likely to contain pseudobulges , providing further support for the idea that the pseudobulge @xmath2  relation is offset below the relation for classical bulges @xcite . in  [ morphology ] below , we investigate the possible dependence of the @xmath2relation fit on host galaxy morphological type for our sample .",
    "simulations of massive bh growth indicates that the scatter in the @xmath2  relation should increase toward the low - mass end . in models with high - mass seeds ,",
    "galaxies evolve from well above the present - day @xmath2  relation toward the relation , while galaxies starting with low - mass seeds first lie far below the relation and their bhs grow to move toward the relation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite suggested that for heavy seeds of @xmath147 @xmath1 , the low - mass end of the @xmath2relation will flatten to an asymptotic value . in our sample , we do not find clear evidence for increasing scatter in the @xmath2  relation at low masses , and we can not discriminate among possible seed models based on our sample . increasing scatter at the low - mass end should nevertheless be a generic result regardless of the seed masses or the details of the bh growth mechanism .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , major mergers decrease the scatter of the @xmath85-@xmath148  relation because of a central - limit tendency of the bh - to - galaxy mass relation to eventually converge to some mean value .",
    "given the previous expectation that low - mass galaxies should show a larger scatter in the @xmath2  relation than high - mass galaxies , as well as the recent observational suggestions of an offset @xmath2relation for pseudobulges relative to classical bulges , it remains somewhat puzzling that the type 1 agn samples do not show an obvious trend of either increasing scatter or changes in slope toward lower masses .",
    "this appears to be the case both for the small sample of agns with reverberation mapping @xcite , and for the larger sample of objects with single - epoch masses presented here .",
    "it could be that the random errors on individual agn virial bh mass estimates are so large that the scatter in the mass estimates ( resulting from variations in blr kinematics , inclination , or other properties ) simply dominates over the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath2  relation for these objects , preventing us from detecting mass - dependent variations in the intrinsic scatter .",
    "direct stellar - dynamical measurements of bh masses in nearby rm agns can be an important cross - check on the derived masses .",
    "however , while observations so far do not reveal evidence for any dramatic offsets between stellar - dynamical and reverberation masses , only a few objects are presently amenable to both types of measurements @xcite . for the vast majority of reverberation - mapped agns ,",
    "the angular size of the bh s gravitational sphere of influence is too small to be resolved by either _",

    "this may be one source of error contributing to the scatter in the relation , and it may also introduce a bias to the zeropoint of the relation . although it would be preferable to plot an @xmath2  relation that did not include this possible bias , there is no simple way to correct for the rotational contribution to the velocity dispersions from our data .      in the discussions above ,",
    "we have adopted an arbitrary virial factor @xmath88 for consistency with most previous work on the sdss - selected gh07 sample .",

    "this illustrates that if we use the @xmath19  of [ ] as a proxy for @xmath9  in active galaxies , the high - velocity wing component should be removed from the profile .",
    "the velocity shifts between the centroids of the wing to core components , defined as @xmath71vel , are mainly negative ( figure  [ fig : eddrt - sig ] , left panel ) , representing blue - shifts of the wing components , while the centroid velocity of the core components are generally close to the systemic velocity measured from the stellar absorption lines .",
    "if the blue - shifted wing component of [ ] is driven by winds or outflows @xcite , then the strength or velocity offset of the wing component could correlate with some measure of agn activity , such as the eddington luminosity ratio , @xmath133 .",

    "this confirms that the previously established correlation between [ ] blueshift and line width continues to hold in this low - mass regime .",
    "we also examine the correlation between gas and stellar velocity dispersions for the [ ] doublet and the [ ] @xmath10   emission line , which has been decomposed from broad h@xmath20 .",
    "since we use the [ ] profile as the model for the narrow lines for most cases ( discussed in section  [ sec : emline ] ) , we can use either the [ ] or [ ] lines .",

    "while @xcite finds a correlation between @xmath205 and eddington ratio for nearby active galaxies , we do not see such a correlation in our sample ( figure  [ fig : eddrt - sig ] , right panel ) .",
    "our sample mostly lies below the relation found by @xcite , but is generally consistent with @xcite .",
    "the objects scatter around @xmath206 ( @xmath207 ) , regardless of increasing eddington ratio .",

    "the flux of [ ] @xmath208   was also measured from the starlight - subtracted spectra by fitting with a single gaussian . from the new data ( with aperture sizes of 075 @xmath209 10 and 1@xmath209 ( 15 @xmath15 3 ) for the esi  and mage  data , respectively ) , we see that a few objects move out of the region of the bpt diagrams and into the seyfert region above the maximum starburst line @xcite . with the small - aperture data ,",
    "most objects lie in the seyfert region of the diagram , with some objects extending to relatively low values of [ ] /h@xmath20  which are indicative of metallicity lower than typical for classical seyferts @xcite .",
    "we investigate whether the line ratios measured from the small - aperture spectra systematically change relative to measurements based on the sdss spectra .",
    "the distributions of line ratios are shown on the top and right panels in figure  [ sec : bpt ] .",
    "these distributions for the low - ionization ratios [ ] /h@xmath20 , [ ] /h@xmath20 , and [ ] /h@xmath20only change slightly as a function of aperture size , with systematic offsets less than 0.08 dex between the median values for the small - aperture and sdss measurements .",
    "this could be the effect of various parameters , due to the complex nlr conditions , including metallicity , ionization parameter , electron density , and dust reddening .",
    "but the [ ] /h@xmath55  ratio measured from the small - aperture data is systematically 0.3 dex higher than the values measured from the sdss fiber aperture .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that in the larger sdss aperture the emission lines included a larger contribution of emission from regions , which would have lower [ ] /h@xmath55  than the agns .",
    "this would also imply that the host galaxies are actively star - forming , and we may be witnessing growth of the host galaxy bulge or pseudobulge coevally with the bh growth .",
    "integral - field observations at high angular resolution would be particularly useful for examining the distribution and luminosity of regions in the host galaxies .",
    "these line - ratio diagrams are generally used to discriminate between star - forming galaxies and agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , as noted by gh07 , the broad - line agns do not lie exclusively above the maximum starburst line of kewley et al .  on the bpt diagrams , and some objects even fall below the empirical line of @xcite in the region of pure star - forming galaxies .",
    "that is , judging by the narrow - line ratios alone , these objects would not be classified as agns . for these objects ,",
    "the detection of the broad h@xmath20  emission is the primary clue that an agn is present , and if the broad emission lines were obscured by a dusty parsec - scale torus or by dust lanes in the host galaxy then these objects would not have been identified as agns at all .",
    "we explore whether the objects which fall below the maximum starburst line are unusual in terms of any of the measured parameters including @xmath9 , @xmath210 ( indicated as @xmath19([])/2.35 ) , the flux ratio between [ ] wing and core , the strength ( relative to [ ] ) , @xmath19(h@xmath20 ) , or the flux ratio between the narrow and broad components of h@xmath20  ( @xmath211 ) .",
    "we find that this sub - population of objects does not exhibit any unusual properties in terms of these parameters , except in @xmath211 , which shows a higher relative strength of the narrow components in this sub - population .",
    "further investigation shows the median redshift of the sub - population ( @xmath212 ) is larger than the whole sample ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "thus the higher @xmath211 ratio could be explained by the dilution of extended star formation contained in the aperture .",
    "it is unfortunately difficult to derive any detailed information on the stellar populations of the hosts from the spectra because of the strong agn contribution to the spectra .",
    "we examined the esi  and mage  spectra , finding that higher - order balmer absorption of significant strength is visually apparent in 18 objects ( about 20% of the sample ) , of which about 10 objects are in the sub - population below the maximum starburst line .",
    "the absorption features imply contributions from a stars .",
    "thus , compared with the sample as a whole , a larger fraction of objects in the sub - population appear to have significant contributions from intermediate - age stellar populations .",
    "we have obtained new echelle spectroscopy of 76 seyfert 1 galaxies selected to have low - mass black holes based on their broad - line widths and @xmath95  luminosity , and we obtain reliable measurements of @xmath9  for 56 galaxies . including the previous 17 seyfert galaxies presented by @xcite , our low - mass agn sample consists of 93 galaxies , of which 71 have measured velocity dispersions .",
    "the velocity dispersion ranges from 31 to 138 km  s@xmath16 , and the data tend to lie on the extrapolation of the @xmath2  relation of inactive galaxies .",
    "we find that the intrinsic scatter in virial @xmath2  relation is not strongly mass - dependent .",
    "combining our results with 56 sdss active galaxies @xcite and reverberation - mapped agns from the literature with @xmath9  measurements and @xmath85  estimation , as well as the two well - known intermediate - mass bhs in ngc 4395 and pox 52 , we carry out new fits to the @xmath2  relation , finding a zero point of @xmath214 and slope @xmath215 for the @xmath2  relation in the form of @xmath216 , for an assumed virial normalization factor of @xmath88 .",
    "the agn @xmath2  relation has an intrinsic scatter of @xmath217 dex , comparable to the intrinsic scatter of the @xmath2  relation observed for inactive galaxies . among our low - mass bh sample with definite broad h@xmath20  components , we find that the lower limit of bh masses detectable in this sdss sample is @xmath107 ( for @xmath88 ) .",

    "the rotation of the disk in the edge - on systems may artificially increase the measured @xmath9 , which may partly introduce a scatter in the relation .",
    "we also confirm that the narrow emission lines [ ] @xmath10  , [ ] @xmath11  , and the core of [ ] @xmath12   ( with the blue - shifted wing removed ) have velocity dispersions which trace the stellar velocity dispersion well , confirming that the forbidden emission - line widths can be used as a useful proxy for the stellar velocity dispersion in low - mass agns .",
