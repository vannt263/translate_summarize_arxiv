    "infrared - luminous sources ( with @xmath25 ) dominate the bright end of the bolometric luminosity function of galaxies in the local universe @xcite . their role in the story of galaxy evolution is not yet understood , but it is likely that their prodigious luminosities are the product of an extremely active phase during which these systems form stars and/or grow their central black holes at a rapid rate @xcite . did all large galaxies exhibit such a phase in their early formative stages , or is this active phase characteristic of only some of the most massive systems ? to address these questions , we need to find and study the primary high - redshift galaxy populations contributing to the mid - ir and far - ir counts and understand their relation to the local galaxy population .    we know a great deal about the local population of ir - luminous galaxies , due in large part to the pioneering observations made with the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ; e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the overall seds of the sources with @xmath7)\\ge14 $ ] span a wide range . at one extreme , the seds are fairly monotonic throughout the mid - ir bands , and are fairly well represented by a power - law , suggesting a broad range of ( warm ) dust temperatures similar to that observed in agn - dominated sources . at the other extreme , the seds show a distinct `` bump '' , which we interpret as being due to the presence of a stellar continuum peaking at a rest - frame wavelength of 1.6@xmath1 m .",
    "examples of the two classes of seds are shown in figure  [ examples ] .",
    "there is a continuum of seds between these two extremes , and it is difficult to define an objective criterion that cleanly discriminates between these two classes , perhaps suggesting that the seds in a large fraction of the population are characterized by both agn and star - formation activity .    in order to establish a more rigorous definition ( more for statistical than physical purposes ) , we define the following objective means of classifying a source sed as being power - law dominated .",
    "we performed two power - law fits to the mid - infrared flux measurements of every source , the first to just the irac measurements ( i.e. , the 3.6@xmath1 m to 8.0@xmath1 m data ) and the second to the combined irac and mips 24@xmath1 m data .",
    "we then examined the power - law indices ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 ; @xmath80 ) and @xmath81 values of the resulting fits .",

    "although this selection appears complex , it does separate the sources which show monotonic seds from the ones which show `` bumps '' or are otherwise different ( due to being too noisy , for example ) .    using this sed discriminant",

    "this is based on the assumption of an extinction law derived using the functional form of @xcite for @xmath137 m and values of the extinction as tabulated in table  4 of @xcite at longer wavelengths .",
    "although the assumption of a monolithic dust screen is unrealistic , it does provide a lower limit on the extinction required in these galaxies .",
    "in addition , the fact that the entire galaxy is so underluminous at rest - frame uv wavelengths suggests that either the stellar population in these systems is old ( i.e. , @xmath138  gyr ) and intrinsically faint at uv wavelengths , or that the dust is distributed on large enough scales to shroud the stellar component as well .",

    "such a scenario would suggest an overall sed for these galaxies containing three ( perhaps related ) components : a reddened stellar component peaking at a rest - frame wavelength of 1.6@xmath1 m , cold dust enshrouding the star - forming regions reradiating the absorbed uv emission at long wavelengths ( corresponding to , say , a rest - frame wavelength of 60@xmath1 m ) , and warm dust enshrouding the agn dominating the emission in the rest - frame mid - infrared ( i.e. , at rest - frame wavelengths of 5 - 20@xmath1 m ) .",

    "such a violent starburst is unlikely to be confined to a small region , and the ( observed ) very large infrared - to - ultraviolet luminosity ratio must result from dust distributed on very large ( kiloparsec ) scales . in addition , star - formation rates this large can not be sustained for long periods , suggesting that these galaxies are viewed during a short - lived phase during which the bulk of the stars is produced .",
    "if , instead , the sources are dominated by agn , then the dust could be mostly confined to the nuclear regions of the galaxy .",
    "however , based on the measurement of large balmer decrements in both broad- and narrow - line components in a few galaxies , @xcite argue that the dust distribution must be patchy and over large volumes .",

    "the present data on the dogs do not allow any useful constraints on either the radiative efficiency , the accretion efficiency , or the black hole mass , but their luminosities of @xmath143 suggest that they must be radiating at close to the eddington luminosity even if they harbor a very massive black hole . even at high accretion efficiencies ( i.e. , @xmath144 )",

    "although the space densities are comparable , it is important to note that each dog contributes significantly more ir ( and bolometric ) luminosity per galaxy to the universe at @xmath23 .",
    "the population of `` massive galaxies '' selected as `` distant red galaxies '' ( drgs ) at near - infrared wavelengths has a space density of @xmath157 @xcite , roughly ten times more numerous than dogs .",
    "as mentioned above , the drg and dog populations also overlap in their rest - frame uv luminosity distributions , and it is therefore possible that a fraction of the star - forming drgs are selected by our @xmath7)\\ge 14 $ ] criterion .",
    "a recent measurement of the luminosity function by @xcite finds that luminous ( i.e. , @xmath158 ) red galaxies in the local universe have a space density of @xmath159 , very comparable to that of the @xmath23 dogs .",
    "it is tempting to suggest that dogs may therefore represent a common phase of evolution for most massive galaxies . indeed ,",
    "if this phase is short lived ( i.e. , if the duty cycle of the enshrouded , luminous phase when galaxies may be selected as dogs is short ) , then the dogs may be the progenitors of a large fraction of present - day @xmath160 galaxies .",
    "more detailed comparisons will require better determinations of the redshift distribution as a function of apparent magnitude and 24@xmath1 m flux density .      in order to estimate the infrared luminosity density contributed by the dogs , we begin by assuming , as before , that all the dogs with no measured spectroscopic redshifts have a redshift probability distrbution described by the gaussian approximation to the observed redshift distribution . for the dogs with spectroscopic redshifts",
    ", we computed their @xmath96 values and converted them to @xmath107 estimates based on the procedure described above .",

    "since dogs with fainter @xmath71 are also typically fainter in the irac bands , we adopt the mean @xmath162 as the spectral index for all sources .",
    "the infrared luminosity density ( irld ) of the entire sample was estimated using 1000 monte carlo simulations of the redshift distribution of the galaxies .",
    "we find the total infrared luminosity density contributed by the dog population to be @xmath163 } = 8.228^{+0.176}_{-0.302},\\ ] ] where irld is in units of @xmath164 and the limits are not 1@xmath34 uncertainties , but the likely range of the irld based on the uncertainties in the @xmath96 to @xmath107 conversion ( i.e. , the lower and upper limits corresponding to @xmath165 and 15 respectively ) .    dogs thus provide a significant contribution to the irld at @xmath23 .",
    "according to @xcite , the total irld from all 24@xmath1m - selected @xmath0 galaxies is @xmath166 , with the contribution from ulirgs alone being @xmath167 of the total .",
    "although dogs presumably represent only a fraction of the @xmath21 population ( i.e. , the reddest subset ) , they appear to contribute @xmath168 of the total irld from the 24@xmath1m - selected @xmath21 galaxy population , and @xmath169 of the @xmath170 .",
    "the @xcite @xmath0 sample is identified ( in the goods - n and -s fields ) using photometric redshift estimates and should , in principle , include dogs . what is noteworthy , however , is that the dogs ( selected solely on the basis of extreme @xmath73 $ ] color ) comprise such a significant component of the irld@xmath171 , which suggests that the dog selection criterion effectively selects out the bulk of ulirgs at @xmath21 .    not all @xmath0 galaxies may be selected as 24@xmath1 m sources .",
    "indeed , one of the most successful methods of selecting high - redshift galaxy populations is based on the uv emission of young , star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "recently , @xcite have estimated the contribution of uv - selected galaxies to the irld at @xmath0 .",

    "do the bright and faint dogs contribute comparably ? to investigate this , we divided the dog samples at @xmath176  mjy , resulting in 2,149 galaxies fainter than the cut with a median flux density of 0.37  mjy , and 452 galaxies brighter than the cut with a median flux density of 0.85mjy .",
    "the redshift distributions on either side of this cut are slightly different ( @xmath177/2.1 for the fainter / brighter galaxies with spectroscopically measured redshifts ) , but there are only 22 redshifts below the cut , so the distribution is not well constrained . if we assume that the distributions are the same at all flux densities , we find the irlds for the bright and faint subsamples are @xmath178=7.78\\pm0.02}$ ] and @xmath179=7.91\\pm0.01}$ ] respectively .",
    "the faint and bright sources thus contribute comparable amounts to the irld , with the increasing number making up for the lower luminosity of the fainter source population .",
    "in actuality , there is a large range in optical - to - infrared color , and we have chosen the @xmath7)\\ge 14 $ ] criterion simply to isolate the higher redshift galaxies . since the redshift distribution is broad , selecting objects at a bluer threshold would still result in high - redshift population , but with a larger low - redshift contamination .",
    "moreover , we recall that the number density of dogs rises toward fainter 24@xmath1 m flux densities , suggesting that @xmath180mjy sources may contribute significantly to the irld as well . in addition , we have not corrected our irld estimates for the sample incompleteness at the faint 24@xmath1 m limit of our data .",
    "for all these reasons , the estimates of space density and luminosity density reported here for the dogs are likely to be lower limits , corresponding to the contribution of only the most extreme ( in @xmath71 and @xmath7)$ ] color ) subset of the population .",
    "it is therefore remarkable that even this relatively rare population can contribute such a significant fraction of the overall infrared luminosity density .",
    "the galaxies selected by virtue of their extreme mid - infrared to optical flux density ratios seem to be under - represented in most optically selected samples of high - redshift galaxies . indeed , our 24@xmath1 m flux density criterion for dogs ( i.e. , @xmath62  mjy , imposed by the existing mips observations of the botes field ) selects a relatively rare population that has only a handful of members in most existing small - field , deep samples .",
    "in this subsection , we attempt to compare our sample with other known @xmath23 galaxy populations , most of which have been selected using observations at optical or near - infrared ( i.e. , rest - frame uv or optical ) wavelengths .    as we mentioned in  3.3.3 ( and shown in figures  [ rbandhist ] and  [ 2200hist ] ) , the dog population is systematically fainter than the uv - bright populations selected at @xmath23 by , say , the `` bx / bm '' selection criteria of @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising , since we are selecting galaxies to have a very large mid - infrared to uv flux ratio .",
    "what is interesting is that our selection results in a sample that lies at high redshift , with no bright , low - redshift members .",
    "moreover , it is important to note that the dog population , while being faint at optical wavelengths , is actually bolometrically very luminous , and thereby contributes significantly to ( and perhaps _ dominates _ ) the top end of the bolometric luminosity function ( i.e. , at @xmath181 ) .    a comparison with the @xmath182  distant red galaxy \" ( drg ) samples selected using near - infrared selection techniques ( typically , @xmath183 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "it is now understood that the drg selection results in a mixed sample of passively evolving systems , star - forming galaxies and agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "since our selection criteria require galaxies to be bright at 24@xmath1 m , it is likely that our selection does not include the passively evolving galaxies .    recently",
    ", much work has been done using the @xmath188 selection technique pioneered by @xcite to select star - forming and passive galaxy populations at high redshift ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) .",
    "we examined the @xmath189 colors of the @xmath188 selected star - forming galaxies in the goods - n field @xcite , and find that only 4 of the 187 @xmath188 galaxies in goods - n satisfy our selection criteria .",
    "the vast majority of the @xmath188 galaxies are less extreme in their @xmath7)$ ] colors , and are fainter in their 24@xmath1 m flux densities",
    ". this may be due to the lower agn contribution ( by selection ) to the mid - infrared luminosities of the @xmath188 star - forming population .    given the surface density of bright dogs ( i.e. , with @xmath62mjy , we would have expected roughly 14 galaxies in the goods",

    "the @xmath7)\\ge 14 $ ] and @xmath188 selections therefore appear to be comparable , with the star - forming systems at bright 24@xmath1 m flux densities effectively selected by both techniques .",
    "the simple @xmath7)$ ] selection results in a slightly larger sample with perhaps a slightly broader redshift distribution .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath188 technique can be fairly expensive in telescope time , requiring deep imaging in three bands .",
    "the simple technique described here of using the @xmath2-[24 ] color selects similar star - forming galaxy and agn populations more economically ( 90  sec with _",
    "spitzer_/mips and 6000  sec of @xmath2-band per field ) .",
    "recently , a similar population of dust - obscured galaxies was identified by @xcite using the following selection criteria : @xmath191  mjy ; @xmath192 .",
    "our selection criterion for dogs corresponds to + @xmath193 , and thus selects the redder , and a higher redshift subset of the population .",
    "the @xcite galaxies with @xmath7)\\ge 14$](15 ) all lie at @xmath194(1.6 ) .",
    "the @xmath195 distribution for dogs shows that the selection criteria used by @xcite would reject 36% of the dogs .    finally ,",
    "although dust - obscured galaxies have been found in other studies using comparable selection criteria , we emphasize the simplicity and robustness of the current approach .",
    "in particular , the simple selection criteria will make it easier , in principle , to quantify the selection function once a large sample of spectroscopic redshifts become available .",
    "one significant difference in the way we select the sample of dogs is that we do not discriminate between agn - dominated and star - formation - dominated systems .",
    "the mid - infrared colors of many of the dogs suggest that they may indeed be dominated by agn at bright 24@xmath1 m flux densities ( i.e. , @xmath196 ) . although the majority of the fainter population does show stellar `` bumps '' , pah emission features in their mid - infrared spectra , and other evidence of starlight in their spectral energy distributions , their mid - infrared , far - infrared , or bolometric luminosity may yet contain a significant contribution from an agn .",
    "the combination of agn and star - formation signatures in the dog population ( and in some cases in the very same objects ) suggests that the population may be undergoing both rapid black - hole growth and rapid star - formation .",
    "we have demonstrated that the simple selection criterion of large mid - infrared to optical flux density ratio efficiently isolates a significant population of @xmath23 galaxies .",
    "these systems are extremely luminous at rest - frame mid - infrared wavelengths , presumably due to warm dust heated by some combination of agn and hot , young stars . what is the role of these galaxies in galaxy evolution ?    in a seminal paper , @xcite proposed that local ulirgs represented a brief dust - enshrouded stage in the formation of quasars . despite the extreme colors of the dogs and the lack of local galaxies ( even ulirgs ) with similar colors , there are some similarities between the two populations .",
    "they are both at the extreme luminous end of the galaxy population at their epochs , and they both appear to be heavily enshrouded systems exhibiting evidence for both intense star formation and agn accretion activity .",
    "we therefore speculate that the dogs represent a fairly short - lived phase in the evolution of massive ( i.e. , @xmath197 ) galaxies , in between the phases represented by the sub - millimeter galaxy population ( smgs ) and the more `` passive '' galaxies ( e.g. , selected as passive @xmath188s or @xmath198s ) .",
    "we envision a scenario in which gas accumulates in deep potentials , triggering an early episode of star - formation which quickly results in the formation of large quantities of dust .",
    "this results in a system which is luminous at sub - mm wavelengths ( as an smg ) , with cold dust temperatures .",
    "the mid - infrared spectra of these systems would show pah features , characteristic of star - forming systems , as has been observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at some point , as the accretion and star - formation proceed , an agn is triggered which heats the dust to warmer temperatures .",
    "it is at this point that the system would have a warmer characteristic dust temperature and be selected as a dog .",
    "if the agn is able to destroy or expel most of the dust ( or the star - formation proceeds to the point where the dust and gas are sufficiently consumed ) , the dog would evolve into an optically visible agn . whether or not the dog is transformed into an optically - luminous agn",
    "will depend on the relative timescales of dust destruction / consumption and agn accretion .",
    "it has been suggested recently that agn feedback and star - burst driven winds can provide two important mechanisms for terminating the star - formation in galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "in such a scenario , the galaxy evolutionary phase represented by dogs would follow the bulge growth phase ( i.e. , the smgs ? ) , but precede the phase when the galaxy may be visible as an optical quasar or , eventually , as a red , passively - evolving galaxy ( i.e. , the drgs or passive @xmath188 galaxies ? ) .",
    "if , instead , the agn phase is more short lived than the uv - bright star - forming phase , then dogs would evolve into a uv - bright star - forming population .",
    "there is some circumstantial support for such a scenario from the measured space density and redshift distribution of the dogs .",
    "the dog surface density on the sky ( of 0.089  arcmin@xmath5 ) is similar to that of the luminous sub - mm galaxy population with 850@xmath1 m flux densities @xmath199mjy @xcite , and they have a comparable redshift distribution @xcite .",
    "the 850@xmath1 m sub - mm flux densities of the dog population have not yet been measured , but the upcoming scuba - ii legacy survey should provide useful constraints . in the scenario described above , the dogs are expected to have warmer dust temperatures than the smgs , and it is indeed interesting that the detection rate of smgs at mips wavelengths ( 24@xmath1 m and 70@xmath1 m ) is low , with only @xmath200% of the smgs in the goods - n field having 24@xmath1 m flux densities @xmath62mjy @xcite .",
    "the space density of the brightest dogs ( with @xmath201  mjy ) is comparable to that of unobscured qsos at comparable redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if these brighter sources are powered primarily by agn , they represent a significant component of the accretion history of supermassive black holes , missed by traditional qso surveys .",
    "clustering analyses of the population may provide a clue to the possible evolutionary products of dogs and the lifetime of the dog phase relative to the smg phase , and we will investigate this in a future paper .",
    "kpno @xmath2-band and _ spitzer _ mips 24@xmath1 m surveys of the botes field of the noao deep wide - field survey reveal a population of galaxies with very extreme optical to mid - infrared colors .",
    "galaxies with such red colors are absent from the local universe ; e.g. , there are no galaxies with these extreme ( rest - frame ) flux density ratios among the @xmath202 galaxies in the botes field . from the 8.14  deg@xmath37 24@xmath1m/@xmath2-band overlap area",
    ", we select a sample of 2,603 galaxies with 24  @xmath1 m flux densities @xmath62  mjy and @xmath7)\\ge 14 $ ] vega mag ( corresponding to @xmath203 .",
    "these galaxies increase in number and as a fraction of the total number towards fainter 24@xmath1 m flux densities , rising from 7@xmath90.6% of the population at @xmath52mjy to 13@xmath91% at @xmath53mjy .",
    "this reddening of the overall source population and the rise of the red fraction is not due to a simple @xmath126-correction ; the colors of this population of objects are redder than any local ulirgs , suggesting that these are very dust enshrouded objects which constitute an increasing fraction of the source population to fainter 24@xmath1 m flux densities .",
    "selection of the reddest sources using a simple color cut of @xmath7)\\ge 14 $ ] effectively isolates a high redshift population .",
    "the spectral energy distributions of these objects range from power - law seds suggestive of highly obscured agn to seds exhibiting a `` bump '' at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the fraction of sources with `` bump '' seds increases toward fainter 24@xmath1 m flux densities .",
    "we interpret the `` bump '' in the seds of the latter group as arising from a stellar component peaking at a rest - frame wavelength of 1.6@xmath1 m .",
    "using spectrographs on the _ spitzer space telescope _ and the telescopes of w. m. keck observatory , we have measured spectroscopic redshifts for 86  galaxies and have determined that the majority of this population lies between the redshift range @xmath204 . the redshift distribution may be modeled as a gaussian with a mean redshift of 1.99@xmath90.05 and width @xmath205 .",
    "the high redshifts imply prodigious luminosities for this population .",
    "corrections to bolometric luminosities are uncertain , but crude estimates suggest luminosites of @xmath206 .",
    "although the dominant source of the luminosity is not conclusively established , it is very likely that both agn and prodigious star - formation contribute to the luminosity .",
    "these dust - obscured galaxies show a range in mid - infrared color , probably due to a change in the relative dominance of agn over star formation contributions to the mid - infrared luminosity .",
    "a rough estimate of the space density of this population suggests a comoving space density of @xmath207 .",
    "this dust obscured galaxy population contributes a significant fraction of the infrared luminosity density at @xmath23 , constituting roughly @xmath208 , where irld is in units of @xmath164 .",
    "this is roughly 26@xmath914% of the total irld contributed by galaxies at this redshift , and @xmath209% of the irld contributed by luminous infrared galaxies with @xmath210",
    ".    the properties of this population suggest that they may be galaxies caught in the very process of formation , undergoing rapid growth of their stellar components and / or nuclear black holes .",
    "we speculate that these dust - obscured galaxies ( or dogs ) may represent an evolutionary phase in the formation of massive galaxies , when the agn is turned on and begins the process of terminating star - formation .",
    "such a picture would envision dogs as being the intermediate stage between the sub - mm galaxy population and the more quiescent galaxies ( e.g. , the ` passive ' drgs ) .",
