    "there has been a rapid increase of publications over the past fifteen years on the computation of electrical and thermal conductivities for warm dense matter ( i.e. , from warm liquids to hot dense plasmas ) @xcite using kohn - sham dft @xcite . in these studies , molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations",
    "are first performed for classical ions moving in the force fields provided by the self - consistently determined electron density within the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "the resulting thermally occupied kohn - sham states from individual ionic snapshots are then inserted into kubo - greenwood @xcite formulas to calculate the appropriate current - current correlation functions .",
    "finally , the results from different uncorrelated snapshots are averaged together and electrical ( @xmath0 ) and thermal ( @xmath1 ) conductivities are obtained . because the temperatures are high enough so that many electrons are free to conduct , and thermal electrons move so much faster than thermal ions , @xmath0 and @xmath1 for such systems are governed entirely by the behavior of the electron currents : the charge current @xmath2 , for @xmath0 , and the heat current @xmath3 , for @xmath1 .",
    "the calculations then amount to a determination of the degradation of these currents resulting from the interactions of the current - carrying electrons with the rest of the plasma , leading to resistance .",
    "the advantage of using a dft - based approach for dense plasmas is that it is unnecessary to decide _ a priori _ which electrons are  bound \" and which are  free \" , as the degree of localization of a given single - electron state is determined in the course of solving the effective mean - field schrdinger - like equation .",
    "however , there is also a disadvantage : the electron - electron interaction is treated in a manner in which the electrons are considered as an aggregate , through their total charge density , rather than individually .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to kinetic theory approaches such as the boltzmann equation , in which explicit encounters between individual particles are considered in the collision terms . with the exception of dft s use of an exchange - correlation potential ( which itself depends only on the total electron charge density ) , the treatment of the e - e interaction is essentially equivalent to that in the vlasov equation ; explicit e - e collisions are absent .",
    "the classic plasma kinetic theory for @xmath0 and @xmath1 is that of spitzer and hrm @xcite , in which a fokker - planck equation is solved to determine the steady - state electron velocity distribution resulting from the application of @xmath4 or @xmath5 , from which @xmath2 and @xmath3 are calculated .",
    "the collisions are treated with coulomb logarithms @xcite , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which account for screening of the two - body interactions in a manner suited to the limit of weak plasma coupling ( e.g. , small - angle scattering ) .",
    "yet a more sophisticated kinetic theory approach is that of the lenard - balescu ( lb ) equation @xcite , in which the bare coulomb collisions are dressed by the multicomponent wave vector and frequency dependent dielectric function ; while resulting in answers identical to that of a fokker - planck equation with appropriately chosen coulomb logarithms for sufficiently weak coupling , lb constitutes a predictive theory in which arbitrary distributions and particle species can be considered .",
    "conductivities of quantum plasmas as predicted by qlb are available @xcite , and comparisons between lb predictions for classical plasmas and the results of classical md have proven very favorable for comparable regimes of plasma coupling @xcite .",
    "however unlike in the dft treatment , only free electrons are considered , and therefore the bound versus free distinction must be made at the outset when studying real plasmas .    a method which attempts to combine some of the positive features of the dft - md and kinetic theory approaches ( though predating the former ) is the average - atom prescription , exhibited generally in the ziman resistivity formula @xcite . here , various means ( including dft )",
    "are used to compute the interaction between an electron and a representative ion , together with its surrounding screening cloud of other electrons .",
    "this interaction is then used in scattering theories of varying sophistication to produce the electronic contributions to @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite , once a statistical distribution of ionic positions is assumed .",
    "if the treatment of the representative ion is sufficiently detailed , bound and free electrons can be treated on similar footing . however the method only treats the electron - ion scattering ; as in the kohn - sham dft , e - e scattering is not included .",
    "this is not a serious restriction for low-@xmath8 liquid metals ( for which the original ziman work was intended @xcite ) , since the imposition of electron degeneracy , and the associated pauli blocking , suppresses the effects of e - e scattering on the electron distribution function @xcite .",
    "but it produces results which are in significant disagreement with , for instance , the spitzer - hrm theory @xcite , particularly for high-@xmath8 and for low-@xmath9 ions , since the effects of the e - e interaction are not outweighed by those of e - i @xcite . as such ,",
    "it is customary to employ separate multiplicative  lorentz gas \" @xcite corrections to @xmath0 and @xmath1 as determined from average - atom theories , which ensure that the final results agree with the weak - coupling limits of plasma kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "these corrections reduce @xmath0 and @xmath1 at high-@xmath8 , relative to their values as predicted by theories in which an e - e collision term is absent , such as in average - atom descriptions and in specialized lenard - balescu treatments focused primarily on degenerate electrons @xcite .",
    "ziman resistivity formula results which are fit to expressions employing coulomb logarithms , together with @xmath8-dependent corrections accounting for e - e interaction , form the basis for many wide - ranged models for plasma conduction @xcite used in continuum simulations of astrophysical objects @xcite , inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) @xcite , and pulsed power applications @xcite . indeed",
    ", the importance of these applications for dense plasmas has fueled several of the dft - based investigations mentioned at the outset @xcite .",
    "as such , these dft works featured comparisons to some of these models for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in ref .",
    "@xcite for instance , comparisons were made to the high-@xmath8 limit of the lorenz number ( @xmath10 ) for hydrogen plasmas , as predicted by spitzer - hrm @xcite .",
    "though reasonable agreement was found , it has since been established that this agreement was spurious , resulting from an incomplete convergence of the dft calculation of @xmath1 with respect to the number of kohn - sham states included in the computation @xcite . while it is certainly reasonable to use dft - based approaches .",
    "@xcite to attempt to go beyond the many approximations inherent in more conventional plasma descriptions .",
    "@xcite , it is equally important to uncover potential weaknesses in the assumptions underlying current implementations of kohn - sham dft for plasma conduction .",
    "this in turn requires that these dft - based predictions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are well - converged . in this work we use the kohn - sham dft prescription , complete with dft - based md and",
    "the kubo - greenwood approach mentioned above , to predict @xmath0 and @xmath1 for hydrogen plasmas at sufficiently high-@xmath8 to make a meaningful comparison to the predictions of the quantum lb equation .",
    "plasma conditions are chosen to be @xmath11 40  g/@xmath12 and @xmath8 between 500 ev and 900 ev , to coincide with a previous study @xcite of hydrogen using classical md and statistical potentials @xcite , where it was demonstrated that the weak - coupling assumptions underlying lb are valid .",
    "these conditions offer the added advantage that the hydrogen atoms are fully ionized , removing a potential discrepancy between the two approaches .",
    "we show that our dft prediction for @xmath0 is in excellent agreement with that of lb , while our prediction of @xmath1 is far too high in this regime . from this , we posit that there are two _ distinct _ contributions of the e - e interaction to plasma conduction : 1 . a mean - field reshaping of the electron distribution function which is present in the dft ( as well as in any theory containing a vlasov or hartree term ) , and 2 . a binary e - e scattering piece which is missing in our current implementation of dft , but which is present in various plasma kinetic theories ( fokker - planck , lb , etc . ) .",
    "we argue that while the first contribution affects both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the second contribution only plays a role for @xmath1 , due to the inability of binary e - e scattering to degrade the electron _ charge _",
    "current in a system in which the conservation of total electron momentum is mandated . by alternately turning off the e - e and e - i collision terms in the quantum lb equation",
    ", we demonstrate that an e - e scattering correction to the dft thermal conductivity can be written in the form : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the thermal conductivity of the electron one - component plasma ( ocp ) as predicted by qlb .",
    "we also find that the reshaping contributions to @xmath0 and @xmath1 are practically identical .",
    "this general framework is further justified by appealing to arguments derived from a quantum boltzmann theory using the zubarev approach @xcite .",
    "our conclusions extend and amplify those made in a recent work investigating the effect of e - e scattering on the electrical conductivity of plasmas @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we outline the specific methods we use to produce converged results for the conductivities of hydrogen plasmas at high-@xmath8 using kohn - sham dft . in section iii , we discuss the comparison of these dft results to those of qlb , and construct our e - e scattering correction for @xmath1 ; additional motivation for this correction using a quantum boltzmann approach is deferred to the appendix .",
    "we conclude in section iv .",
    "density functional molecular dynamics ( dft - md ) simulations , performed with vasp @xcite , are used to generate atomic configurations for hydrogen with @xmath15 40  g/@xmath12 and @xmath8 of 500 , 700 , and 900 ev .",
    "the electronic temperature is established through a fermi occupation of the electronic states .",
    "all calculations are performed in the local density approximation @xcite .",
    "given the very high densities being explored ( @xmath16 bohr ) , we employ a bare proton @xmath17 potential for the hydrogen atom .",
    "the plane wave cutoff energy is set to 3800 ev , and the electronic density and single - particle wave functions are sampled at a single @xmath18-point at the @xmath19-point ( @xmath20 ) in the brillouin zone corresponding to the supercell ( see below ) .",
    "the practical limit on our calculations proved to be 256 hydrogen atoms in a periodically - repeated cubic supercell .",
    "simulations with more atoms were intractable in combination with the very high temperatures and corresponding need for a very large number of bands for the transport properties and the very high plane wave cutoff energy .    in each of these three cases ,",
    "the electrons are fully ionized from the hydrogen nuclei .",
    "correspondingly , we calculate the fundamental dimensionless plasma parameters for these three cases , namely the ion - ion coupling factor @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the wigner - seitz radius for the protons , and the electron degeneracy @xmath23 as shown in table  [ plasmanumbers ] .",
    "note that even for the highest temperature of 900 ev , where @xmath24 , we expect some residual consequences of electron degeneracy .",
    "we now calculate the conductivities for an electron ocp model with only e - e interactions .",
    "this can be done with the hamilton operator @xmath28 by taking the limit @xmath29 after calculating the @xmath30 .",
    "otherwise , the onsager coefficients are divergent ( @xmath31 ) or indefinite ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) in the nondegenerate limit .",
    "we have treated the electron ocp model by using up to four moments @xmath34 .",
    "the result for the thermal conductivity can be represented as : @xmath35 the values for the factor @xmath36 are given in table  [ tab - sp ] .",
    "we now explore the ansatz ( [ eqskappa ] ) in the nondegenerate limit @xmath37 within the approximation @xmath38 .",
    "we begin by writing @xmath39      the factor @xmath44 , to be compared to the exact value @xmath45 , is listed in the last column of table  [ tab - sp ] .",
    "we observe a fast convergence as before to 1.6605 at the level of 4 moments .",
    "the deviation from the correct value in 4th order ( 1.6114 ) is just 3.0% , i.e. ,  similar to the deviations of the numerical data from the quantum lb equation ; see figs .",
    "[ figsigma ] and [ figs ] .",
    "if instead we use the spitzer values for @xmath46 and @xmath47 agreement with the spitzer lorenz number is within 2.2% .",
    "note that the coincidence of the values for @xmath45 and @xmath44 , i.e. ,  of the direct and sum of the inverse thermal conductivities representing electron - ion and electron - electron scattering contributions , is only obtained if we use the prefactor @xmath48 , which contains the influence of both electron - ion and electron - electron scattering .",
    "alternatively , we can take the ansatz ( [ eqskappa ] ) as an equality and solve for @xmath49 @xmath50 at the level of 4 moments , we find @xmath51 and with the spitzer values for @xmath46 , @xmath52 , and @xmath47 , we obtain @xmath53 . note that both of these results , for @xmath44 or @xmath49 , were obtained in a parallel approach to that taken in the main text within the qlb framework , and are completely general in the non - degenerate limit .",
    "the approximation of the shifted velocity distribution can be made in the case of nearly degenerate electrons , wherein for @xmath0 , the steady - state electron distribution function can be taken to be : @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the equilibrium distribution and @xmath56 is the number density of electrons .",
    "see c. kittel , introduction to solid state physics ( john wiley and sons , inc .",
    ", new york , 1995 ) .",
    "our lenard - balescu treatment is very similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , with the notable exception that they employ an additional collision term to account for hard scattering .",
    "we have established that this additional term is of no importance for the plasma conditions discussed here .",
    "we also note that our numerical procedures are slightly different from theirs for the terms which are common to the two approaches ; but again , the discrepancies resulting from these differences are very minor .",
    "1 and 2 of ref .  @xcite for comparisons along these lines .    by comparing the conductivities calculated with classical versus quantum collision integrals within the zubarev formalism , we estimate this difference to be on the order of 20% at 500 ev , and less than 10% at 900 ev .",
    "we use the notation @xmath57 somewhat loosely here ; @xmath58 refers to the velocity of the electron in the semiclassical sense . in the actual kohn - sham dft calculation",
    "performed on a periodic array of supercells , @xmath58 is related to the wave vector , @xmath59 ."
