    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are a kind of astrophysical phenomenon so luminous in the universe that their isotropic energies of @xmath0 are usually considered coming from extremely relativistic outflows with bulk lorentz factors as high as @xmath1 .",
    "the connection between long - duration grbs and broad - line sne ib / c ( low - metallicity ) has been supported by some pieces of observational evidence @xcite .",
    "the recently launched fermi gamma - ray space telescope with the on - board gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) and large area telescope ( lat ) instruments ( @xcite ) in conjunction with the _ swift _ narrow field instruments @xcite have opened a new era of understanding physical mechanisms of gev photon emission in very energetic grbs and their relation to lower - energy afterglow emission . up to now ,",
    "several novel yet tricky features have appeared during the whole period of observations and their complexities have challenged the anterior established theoretic models .",
    "the first feature is that the sub - mev and gev photons observed by gbm and lat respectively behave distinctive spectral and temporal properties .",
    "the gbm light curves are nearly flat during the main episode of the prompt emission , then drop extremely rapidly [ e.g. @xmath2 for grb 080916c @xcite ] , and eventually cease abruptly .",
    "this can also be validated from @xmath3 of all bursts detected by the _ swift _",
    "satellite @xcite . for the lat light - curves ,",
    "however , a rise appearing in the early few seconds ( @xmath4 ) was followed by a single power - law decay without any cutoff up to hundreds of seconds after the gbm trigger , till below the monitor sensitivity , and decay of the late lat emission was much shallower than the gbm - detected counterparts at the same times @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the lat emission usually lags the gbm emission from a fraction of seconds to a few seconds .",
    "in addition , the spectral slopes of the gbm and lat emissions are often different , e.g. , the gbm data can be fitted with a band spectrum that is composed of two smoothly - joining power laws , while the lat data are often fitted by a power law with a slope intermediate between the two slopes of the gbm fit .",
    "these properties seem to indicate that the high - energy emission and low - energy emission detected by lat and gbm have different origins .",
    "the temporal properties of the lat emission have been studied , and some explanations differing in the source s dominant component have been proposed .",
    "a prevalent explanation is particle - dominated models .",
    "one inclination is the leptonic interpretation . because of their distinctive light curve properties we mentioned above , it is highly probable that the mev photons may be of an internal origin , while the gev photons may be generated via synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated by an external forward shock that also leads to lower - energy afterglow emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the klein - nishina effect on the high - energy afterglow emission and found that at early times such an effect strongly suppress the inverse compton scattering of those electrons that produce the high - energy emission .",
    "thus synchrotron radiation of the electrons becomes a plausible mechanism .",
    "this conclusion was independently drawn by @xcite , who suggested that the lack of a thermal component in the gbm spectrum of grb 080916c is consistent with a relativistic poynting - flux - dominated outflow .",
    "the explanation of synchrotron radiation of the electrons accelerated by a forward shock is fairly natural to account for both the observed delay of the @xmath5 mev photons and long lasting of their emission .",
    "however , a thermal component deviating from the smooth band spectrum function in some bursts ( i.e. grb090510 , grb090902b , grb090926a ) seems to be beyond a prediction of what is often invoked from the external shock model @xcite .",
    "moreover , a rapid rise during the first few seconds ( e.g. @xmath6 of grb080916c ) is hard to be well explained within such a framework @xcite .",
    "therefore , in addition to the hypothesis of a separate origin , @xcite assumed that gev and mev photons may come from the same region , but the onset of the high - energy may result from anisotropic inverse compton scattering of an optical - thin expanding cocoon , delayed compared with the mev emission .",
    "nevertheless , in their calculation , this up - scattering cocoon is so short - lived that it could not account for the whole high energy emission .",
    "another approach is the hadronic scenario .",
    "@xcite suggested that the mev and gev photons could be interpreted as the radiation of accelerated electrons and cosmic ray protons respectively , as well as the delay between them could come from different cooling time scales in a highly magnetized shock . in their framework , the model of grb 080916c is plausible only when @xmath7 and the jet opening angle @xmath8 .",
    "alternatively , @xcite considered another possibility of the photomeson cascade and proton synchrotron models , and provided their constraint in grb090510 .",
    "notwithstanding , to reproduce the extra component around gev with these models , the isotropic - equivalent proton injection luminosity is required to be larger than @xmath9 .",
    "such a large proton luminosity is a challenge for the hadronic models .",
    "all the works mentioned above inspire us to consider a plausible structured outflow , in which the bulk lorentz factor of the initial shells tends to be lower than that of the late shells .",
    "this energy accumulation , therefore , would lead to an early rapidly rising light curve and transient soft to hard spectrum .",
    "the second feature of the three long grbs with lat data is that some humps or flares appear in the light curves of the @xmath10 s low - energy afterglows ( @xcite ) . neglecting this feature ,",
    "@xcite fitted the multi - band light curves of these grbs by assuming that a relativistic external shock sweeps up an interstellar medium , and obtained reasonable physical parameters or parameter spaces accordingly .",
    "although their fittings somehow favor the external shock model , humps ( or sometimes flares ) have indeed been observed on the late - time optical and x - ray afterglow light curves , which do not completely accord with a simple power - law but instead the decay after the humps is shallower than that before the humps .",
    "these observations call for a more meticulous consideration of the external shock model .",
    "it is noted that a density - jump medium proposed by @xcite has provided us with a clue for some optical and x - ray humps and well fitted to several bursts ( @xcite ) . in this scenario ,",
    "a relativistic jet first expands in a stellar wind , subsequently encounters a density jump , and finally expands in a homogeneous medium .",
    "this interaction can produce an observed light - curve bump .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the early - time gev emissions together with the late - time radio , optical , and x - ray afterglows of grbs 080916c , 090902b , and 090926a can be understood as being due to synchrotron emission from an external forward shock caused by structured ejecta propagating in a wind bubble jumping to a homogeneous density medium . in sec.[sect :",
    "obs ] we include a set of observed broadband ( lat , xrt , uvot ) data on these three luminous long bursts .",
    "then , our model is set up in sec.[sect : model ] .",
    "in particular , the structured ejecta can well explain the universal early rising feature of the gev emission from these bursts , and the density - jump medium can account for some certain plateaus and flares in the late afterglows . additionally , for the sake of verifying whether or not the lower energy ( x - ray , optical , radio ) emission originates from the same source as the higher energy ( @xmath11100 mev ) emission",
    ", we discuss the effect of synchrotron self - compton ( synchrotron self - absorption ) on the high energy ( radio ) emission , which , in the constrained parameter space estimated analytically from xrt and uvot light curves , is proved in sec.[sect : fit ] to have a small contribution to the flux density during the observed period . in this section ,",
    "we find a reasonable set of parameters valid for most of the late afterglows .",
    "our conclusions concerning a plausible central engine and ambient environment of bright , long grbs are discussed in sec.[sect : con ] .    throughout this work ,",
    "we adopt the convenience @xmath12 in units of cgs .",
    "among the 19 observed fermi - lat grbs during the first 2 years operation , grb080916c , grb090902b and grb090926a are 3 typical brightest long grbs with abundant of spectra information @xcite .",
    "this burst , located at redshift @xmath13 @xcite , is the first grb detected by fermi with high significance of photons at energies @xmath14 gev .",
    "the isotropic energy emitted from prompt emission can be estimated as @xmath15 @xcite . at 00:12:45.613542 on 16 september 2008 @xcite ,",
    "this grb was triggered on by gbm with the duration @xmath16s . before @xmath17s",
    ", the lat light - curve shows an extremely steep rise @xmath18 , followed by a simple power law decay @xmath19 until @xmath20s @xcite .",
    "x - ray and optical photons were detected by xrt and uvot since 17:11:28 16 september 2008 ( @xmath21ks ) .",
    "a steep decay ( to @xmath22ks ) continued with a plateau ( to @xmath23ks ) goes to a slightly shallower decay without break until 1.3ms from the trigger @xmath24 . during the period of @xmath21ks@xmath25ks , the simple power law light curve and spectrum evolution",
    "show the flux density at x - ray band , @xmath26 , as well as for the optical band , @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "besides , agile , rhesso , integral , konus - wind , and messenger all provide a plentiful of data information for the late afterglow @xcite .",
    "many groups have studied this grb with the external shock model ( @xcite ) , and suggested that the late time afterglow data can be used to extrapolate the early lat data as well as be predicted from it , under the preference of circumburst density stratification .",
    "this burst is an exceptional case with redshift @xmath28 , whose speciality lied in both phases of prompt emission and early afterglow @xcite . unlike majority of the other grb events , excess emission exhibited in both low ( @xmath29kev ) and high ( @xmath30mev ) band during the prompt emission",
    "moreover , the soft - hard - soft spectral evolution indicates two components : band function peaking at @xmath31kev + simple power - law with photon index @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the isotropic energy release @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "there are some explanations for origin of the high - energy power - law emission component observed in the lat energy range ( which accounts for @xmath34 of the total 10kev to 10gev fluence ) , including the hadronic origin [ either proton synchrotron radiation @xcite or photohadronic interactions @xcite ] , or thermal emission from the jet photosphere @xcite .",
    "this burst was triggered and located at 11:05:08.31 on september 2009 , by the fermi - gbm @xcite and suzaku - wam @xcite with multipeaked duration @xmath35 .",
    "after a rapid rise until @xmath36s , the lat band light - curve decays up to @xmath37ks with @xmath38 , including an energetic photon detected as high as @xmath39 gev within the prompt emission phase and another @xmath40 gev at @xmath41s @xcite .",
    "the _ swift _ xrt ( @xcite ) and uvot @xcite began concurrently target of opportunity of the field of grb090902b s fading source from 23:36 on 2 september 2009 and copious of data have been in hand from @xmath42ks . a steep decay ( to @xmath43ks ) simultaneously ended with a slight rise in both bands .",
    "it is highly possible that jet break occurred at @xmath44ks @xcite . during this whole period ,",
    "the x - ray spectrum evolved as @xmath45 , and for the optical band , @xmath46 .",
    "in addition , vla began to observe the afterglow since 3 september 2009 @xcite until 5 months later at 8.5ghz and 4.8ghz .    using the forward - reverse shock and constant density model",
    ", @xcite suggested the afterglow of this burst is better fitted in x - ray and radio bands than in the optical / uv band , except for the first point at @xmath47s .",
    "parameter constraints without taking lat data into account suggest a low circumburst density and a large kinetic energy , which is possible in the narrow opening angle @xmath48 .",
    "later , @xcite have provided a meticulous discussion about the two - component forward - reverse external shock in a monotonic circumburst environment and their calculation was well fit to the four observed bands , except for the very early rising part of the lat light curve .",
    "this burst is the grb detected at @xmath49 by fermi with photons as high as @xmath50 gev at 26s after the trigger @xcite .",
    "the prompt emission time - integrated flux indicates its isotropic emission energy of @xmath51 @xcite .    since the trigger at 04:20:26:26.99 on 26 september 2009 , gbm and lat started operation and found that multiple pulses with total duration @xmath52 can be well modeled by a band function spectrum in the prompt emission , along with the suzaku - wam @xcite , konus - wind @xcite , and rt-2 on coronas - photon @xcite .",
    "the light curve rose slightly for quite a few seconds ( to @xmath53s ) , and decayed @xmath54 .",
    "a fading x - ray counterpart was observed by xrt since 17:17 on 26 september ( @xmath55ks ) @xcite , then prompt , smarts detected photons in several optical filters but no radio ( 5.5ghz ) source under the limit of 1.5mjy was detected up to 1 october 2009 . as shown on the light curve",
    ", a plateau ( @xmath56ks @xmath57ks ) overlaps the simple power law decay that is slightly steeper than the fading supposed to be extrapolated from the early trace .",
    "no break up to 100ks from the trigger @xmath24 was observed . during the period from @xmath55ks to @xmath58ks , two variabilities , are suggested to be flares ( the first , at @xmath59 with @xmath60 ; the second is slight , at 195ks-260ks , with @xmath61 ) overly on the simple power law light curve in both x - ray band ( @xmath62)and optical band ( @xmath63 ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite studied the later afterglow ( x - ray , optical ) of this burst , provided a certain parameter space , confirmed the second flare , and indicated that the jet break occurs around @xmath64d .",
    "however , due to lack of radio data , the constraints can not be narrowed down . meanwhile , as for a common rebrightening plateau in 5 optical bands , they suggested a density - jump circumstance ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) or a smooth injection of energy into the forward shock from the central engine ( e.g.,@xcite ) , and called for a detailed analysis for the early higher energy emission .",
    "the behavior of the grb afterglows shed light on the external shock model @xcite .",
    "a collimated ( @xmath65 ) , ultrarelativistic outflow of matter and/or radiation is driven by a central engine .",
    "some certain dissipative processes within the outflow give rise to the prompt gamma - ray emission , with a fraction @xmath66 of the total relativistic energy converted to high - energy radiation .    a self - consistent result of the multiband ( x - ray , optical , radio ) afterglow data coordinated with the prompt emission relics producing @xmath67 photons , may support the external shock origin of lat photons , which is the same as the later lower - band emission .",
    "meanwhile , due to the difference between the light curve slope of lat and gbm , we take no consideration of the gbm emission in this piece .",
    "moreover , the particularities of grb 090902b we mentioned above ( soft - hard - soft spectral evolution , flares ) may evoke doubts about the conventional external shock + monotonic circumstance model ( we will discuss it in sec.[sect : con ] ) , but enlighten our deliberate consideration on amendment to structured ejecta sweeping up the density - jump medium .",
    "energy can be injected by a central engine continuously during a period ( majority of which is within the first main pulse of prompt emission , before @xmath68 ) .",
    "we here suggest , within the framework of the collapsar model , an increase of the lorentz factor of the ejecta in active time of the central engine may due to two reasons .",
    "first , angular momentum of the accreted fall - back matter would spin up the central compact object and thus its rotational energy loss could give rise to an increase of the ejecting luminosity .",
    "second , earlier - ejected shells , when breaking through the stellar envelope , may suffer from more massive baryon contamination , and thus later - ejected shells may propagate in a tunnel ( the later the cleaner ) . therefore , the lorentz factor of the ejecta head may increase with time . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume the bulk lorentz factor of the front materials distribute as a power - law function of time : @xmath69 for @xmath70 . if @xmath71 , the lorentz factor of the shocked matter increases , being due to energy injection .",
    "we denote @xmath72 as the accumulated mass ejected by the central engine at some certain time , and @xmath73 as the bulk lorentz factor of a blast wave at this certain time , which is defined when the mass of the surrounding matter swept up by the blast wave , @xmath74 , is equal to @xmath75 . after this time",
    ", the bulk lorentz factor presents an obvious deceleration , contributing to a peak of the lat light curve .",
    "this time is called the deceleration time @xmath76 , which is assumed in this paper to be around the stop time of effective energy injection . this assumption is reasonable because energy injection to the forward shock is effected by the circumburst medium .",
    "thus , both the apparent energy - injection time @xmath68 and the deceleration time @xmath76 should be shorter than the central engine ceasing time @xmath77 .",
    "the shock propagates a distance @xmath78 during a small observed time @xmath79 . assuming the proton number density of a medium @xmath80 , thus for a homogeneous medium ( @xmath81 ) , @xmath82 ( @xcite ) or for a wind medium ( @xmath83 ) , @xmath84 ( @xcite ) . in both cases ,",
    "we obtain @xmath85 the deceleration radius can be written as @xmath86    therefore , @xmath87 . according to @xcite , in order to check whether the the unshocked ejecta is assumed to be equal to that of the shocked matter , let @xmath88 represent the thickness of the shell , and @xmath89 be the density ratio between the preshock fluid in the shell and in the circumburst surrounding ( @xmath83 ) , given by @xmath90 this may bring about a correction for the gev rising part under different conditions , i.e. , in the thick shell case , @xmath91 , a reverse shock is relativistic , the lorentz factor of the shocked fluid should be changed and the contribution of the reverse shock to the flux density should be considered , while in the thin shell case , @xmath92 , this change is negligible .",
    "however , no matter how the thickness of the shell is , @xmath93 . in the following analytical calculations , we simplify that @xmath94 ( which can be observed from the figures of temporal flux density ) and assume that the self - similar condition is established after the deceleration time .    before the deceleration time , energy is continuously injecting into the former shells .",
    "the mass ejected later catches up with the earlier ones , and @xmath95 can be simplified as the bulk lorentz factor of these materials combination . in the very beginning , it is possible that the bulk lorentz factor is too low for majority of high - energy gamma rays to escape from the mev background . according to predominate hypothesis ( @xcite ) , only when the optical depth of the @xmath96-ray absorption @xmath97 , the bulk lorentz factor is large enough to radiate almost completely . in this piece , we use sketchy in @xcite to check whether the absorption play a dominate role in certain parameter spaces .      because of the association of long grbs with star forming regions , it is highly possible that massive stars are still embedded in a cloud when giving birth to grbs .",
    "low density bubbles are created by stellar winds from grb progenitors , whose sizes and densities strongly depend on the initial ambient density",
    ". therefore , a density jump occurs at the boundary between the wind bubble and the outer cloud , which may result in a bump / flare and shallow decay of the light curve during the later period @xcite .",
    "it has been usually assumed that the afterglow emission from the blast wave is nearly adiabatic ( @xcite ) , so the total kinetic energy of the relativistic shock is constant .",
    "however , if we take radiative energy loss into consideration , the radiation efficiency of the blast wave can be given with the electronic fraction @xmath102 by @xcite @xmath103 in such a situation , energy loss is significant in the fast cooling and gradually dwindle to the quasi - adiabatic case ( i.e. , the slow cooling phase ) .",
    "hereafter , a denotation @xmath104 can analytically result in the bulk lorentz factor evolution , @xmath105 consequently , the doppler factor becomes @xmath106@xmath107 ( where @xmath108 is the emitting latitude angle ) .",
    "when the blast wave reaches the density boundary , the observed light curve will not behave as an abrupt jump but a smooth rise or plateau instead , due to the curvature effect ( @xcite ) .",
    "although this is trifle to be accomplished in analytic modeling , a simplified power law distribution of medium density in the period of @xmath109 can account for the same light curve feature ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : parameter].a ) .",
    "succeedingly , the blast wave radius can be written as @xmath110      in the comoving frame , with an electronic fraction @xmath102 and magnetic fraction @xmath111 of the post - shock thermal energy density , which may either vary or not with different media .",

    "furthermore , the tricky yet popular early rise of the lat ( @xmath11100mev ) light curve may indicate whether high energy photons share the same source as the low energy afterglows . aside from two main kinds of explanation we mentioned above , leptonic or baryonic models ,",
    "an alternative possibility comes from the high - latitude prompt emission @xcite and thus the flux density evolves as @xmath389 .",

    "no matter whether take the kn cutoff into account , this might be inconsistent with the observed rise of the lat light curve .",
    "our explanation for the initial rising part is simply based on the assumption that @xmath406 .",

    "co - contribution of the optical depth and structured ejecta bring about the rising .",
    "this assumption can be understandable within the framework of of the core collapse of a massive star ( i.e. , sne ib / c ) .",
    "if the central engine ejects matter continuously , a clean tunnel would be left after the early ejecta sweeps up the stellar envelope , and the succeeding ejecta , whose energy is attained via continuous accretion even after the lat trigger and whose lorentz factor is larger , catches up with the early ejecta and injects more energy into the blast wave , giving rise to a rise of the lat light curve . on the other hand ,",
    "the thermal component can also be explained under such assumption that the previous jet lost kinetic energy due to impedance from shock frontier , then turned it into thermal radiation .",
    "this hypothesis have been provided by @xcite that , in the case of red - giant or blue super giants , the powerful jet lose its energy input at its base in the course of overtaking the sub - relativistic weak supernova shock before reaching the surface , and eject little highly relativistic matter ; while in a helium star , the jet breaking out with continuously accretion power receiving at the base will lead its motion become highly relativistic .",
    "later , some other possibilities , such as @xcite s baryon pollution scenario and @xcite s initial envelope choked model , also result in the earlier power - law rising distribution of bulk lorentz factor .    in our frame ,",
    "sub - mev photons provide the background annihilation with the later gev ones .",
    "on one hand , photon with the largest energy from the external shock fasten the constraint of lower lorentz factor of the ejecta [ in @xcite , the lower limit of the bulk lorentz factor should be @xmath411 ; on the other hand , even the ejecta is slower than the lower limit , it is possible that the earlier rising is paretically contributed from opacity effect .    about the observed time delay of the pulses and variabilities in both lat and gbm bands , some other modulation effects , except for optical depth can account for the concurrent variabilities in both bands , such as inhomogeneous surroundings , energy injection , etc .. these factors indicate that the variability connection between lat and gbm @xcite can not give a sufficient clue to the internal / external origin of the gev photons .    in particular , as for grb090902b ,",
    "one of the tricky properties is its soft - hard - soft quasi - thermal spectrum evolution , since the soft - hard evolution appears within @xmath412 , it can be better understood by our model that the initial outflow was dissipated as thermal component by the denser shock front / photosphere , when it breaks out of the envelope , the consequent highly relativistic ejecta in a clean tunnel can be dissipated strong enough to produce energetic non - thermal emission , even the photosphere can be outshined to some extent , therefore , the spectrum evolves from soft to hard .",

    "<S> we present broadband ( radio , optical , x - ray and gev ) fits to the afterglow light curves and spectra of three long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs 080916c , 090902b , and 090926a ) detected by the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) and large area telescope ( lat ) instruments on the fermi satellite . using the observed broadband data , we study the origin of the high energy emission , and suggest that the early - time gev emission and the late - time radio , optical , and x - ray afterglows can be understood as being due to synchrotron emission from an external forward shock caused by structured ejecta propagating in a wind bubble jumping to a homogeneous density medium . </S>",
    "<S> if the ceasing time for majority of the energy injection is assumed to be close to the deceleration time of the forward shock , the structured ejecta with continuous energy injection to the forward shock can well explain the early rising feature of the gev mission from these burst , and the density - jump medium can account for some certain plateaus or flares in the late afterglows . from our fits , we find that , on one hand , the external shock origin of the gev photons will make the optical depth have not significant contribution to the early lat rising part , which will loosen strong constraint of lower limits of lorentz factor . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> these fermi - lat events preferentially occur in a low - density circumburst environment , in which case the klein - nishina cutoff will significantly suppress the self - synchrotron compton ( ssc ) radiation </S>",
    "<S> . such an environment might result from superbubbles or low - metallicity progenitor stars ( which have a low mass - loss rate at late times of stellar evolution ) of type ib / c supernovae . </S>"
