    "galaxy populations show great diversity in morphologies and colors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". many studies of the local and high - redshift universe show that there exist strong relations between galaxy morphology , color and environment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to explain the observed correlations , current theories of galaxy formation and evolution adopt a @xmath14-dominated cold dark matter model for the universe where large - scale structure is built through hierarchical clustering of dark matter halos .",
    "early - type galaxies are then assembled through the ( successive ) merging of disks that formed in these halo s .",
    "an important test of this formation scenario is to trace and quantify the redshift evolution of observable galaxy properties as a function of environment .",
    "significant progress has recently been made on this issue with the availability of large and homogeneous datasets for direct comparisons with theoretical predictions .",
    "for example , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been used at the low redshift end ( @xmath15 ) to study various correlations between observable galaxy properties and the larger scale environment @xcite . at higher redshifts",
    ", @xcite were able to put strong constraints on hierarchical formation models by exploring the rest - frame properties of color - selected early - type galaxies as function of redshift . in this letter , we include galaxy environment as another important variable in the evolutionary signatures predicted by the hierarchical models . taking the sdss as baseline @xcite we examine both the morphology ( bulge- vs. disk - dominated ) and rest - frame color ( red vs. blue ) redshift evolution of galaxies residing within different environments from the field to massive clusters .",
    "we make use of data from the canada  france ",
    "hawaii telecope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) which is well suited to address these issues as its extensive sky coverage provides large , homogeneous and statistically well - defined samples of galaxies spanning a wide range of redshifts and densities .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : section  [ data ] describes the cfhtls - deep data , and section  [ analysis ] outlines the morphology and environment analysis . in section  [ results ] , we present and discuss our results .",
    "the cosmological parameters adopted throughout this letter are @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the cfhtls - deep survey consists of @xmath18 images of four uncorrelated areas of the sky taken with the megaprime prime focus mosaic imager ( thirty - six 2080x4622 chips ) .",
    "each patch covers about @xmath2 and is located away from the galactic plane in order to minimize galactic extinction and bright star contamination .",
    "when completed , the deep survey will produce images almost as deep as the hubble deep field @xcite but covering an area of the sky 3500 times as large .",
    "the data used here are from the cfhtls - d3 field ( ra(2000)@xmath19 , dec(2000)@xmath20 ) after one year of observing .",
    "d3 was chosen because it overlaps with a canada - france redshift survey field @xcite and partially with the  groth strip \" @xcite .",
    "we thus have 338 spectroscopic redshifts available from the literature for calibrating our photometric redshifts .",
    "the data were processed ( de - biassed , flat - fielded , fringe - corrected , etc . ) through the elixir pipeline @xcite and retrieved from the canadian astronomical data centre ( cadc ) .",
    "all the images were astrometrically and photometrically calibrated and then stacked ( gwyn et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the final photometric zero - point uncertainties are less than @xmath21 mag .",
    "the galaxy photometry package sextractor @xcite was used to detect objects in the @xmath22-band and to perform photometry using @xcite apertures .",
    "photometric redshifts and spectral types were determined ( gwyn et al . , in preparation ) . based on a comparison with the available spectroscopic redshifts ,",
    "the typical relative photometric redshift error is @xmath23 . using the best - fit photometric redshift and spectral type",
    ", we calculated @xmath24-corrections and @xmath18 rest - frame galaxy ab absolute magnitudes . the maximum accessible volume @xmath25 @xcite was also computed for each object ( gwyn et al . , in preparation ) by determining the redshift range over which its magnitude would fall within the @xmath22-band limiting magnitude of the sample ( @xmath26 mag ) .",
    "galaxies were then weighted by the resulting @xmath27 values to compute number densities in the color - magnitude plane .",
    "we measured the structural parameters of our galaxies in the @xmath22-band in a quantitative , uniform and reproducible way using the gim2d package @xcite .",
    "we fit two - dimensional , psf - convolved , pure srsic models of the form @xmath28 to our galaxy images .",
    "the shape or concentration parameter @xmath3 is known as the `` srsic index '' @xcite .",
    "the choice of such a simple model was better suited to the spatial resolution of our ground - based data than a full , more complex bulge+disk decomposition .",
    "spatially - varying point - spread - functions ( fwhm@xmath29 ) were constructed across each megaprime chip directly from stars in the images using the daophot package @xcite . the galaxy total flux ( @xmath30 ) and _ intrinsic _ half - light radius @xmath31 were obtained by integrating the best - fit gim2d srsic model out to @xmath32 .",
    "absolute rest - frame total @xmath33-band magnitudes ( @xmath0 ) were calculated for the best - fit models from the apparent and absolute aperture magnitudes .",
    "following @xcite we conducted extensive simulations in order to characterize the systematic biases and random errors in the gim2d / cfhtls - d3 @xmath34-band structural measurements .",
    "after careful inspection of our simulation results , we concluded that the sample we will use with @xmath35 mag ( 1 ) has a completeness of @xmath36 and ( 2 ) has combined random and systematic errors of @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "a total of 65,624 galaxies with @xmath26 mag and @xmath1 were used for our overdensity calculations . for each galaxy",
    "we estimate the overdensity of its environment relative to mean density at its redshift using the projected distance , @xmath40 , to the fifteenth nearest galaxy .",
    "the overdensity is then defined as the ratio of the galaxy number density within a cylinder of length @xmath41 and radius @xmath40 centered at the galaxy over the mean number density : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is an areal correction factor for the edges of the megaprime detectors , @xmath41 is the luminosity distance interval corresponding to a redshift interval centered at the galaxy , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the total number of galaxies and total volume within the effective megaprime field ( @xmath46 ) of the same redshift interval .",
    "an important issue is to properly take into account inaccuracies introduced by the usage of the photometric redshift .",
    "we address this by first assuming that each @xmath47 value has an associated gaussian error probability distribution .",
    "each galaxy is then successively placed in the center of five adjacent redshift bins with the central bin at @xmath47 and the outermost bins benchmarking the @xmath48 confidence level .",
    "we adopt @xmath23 as the redshift uncertainty estimator .",
    "all five @xmath39 s are weighted by the gaussian probability distribution and averaged to yield one final overdensity estimate for each galaxy .",
    "monte carlo simulations show that nearly @xmath49 of the galaxies have a measurement error on @xmath39 smaller than 0.3 ( @xmath50 confidence level ) .",
    "we selected all galaxies with @xmath51 01 and @xmath52 mag ( corresponding to @xmath53 at @xmath7 ) to keep only galaxies with reliable structural parameters ( see @xmath54 ) .",
    "due to low number statistics we adopt a lower redshift limit of @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore we exclude @xmath56 objects due to their large uncertainties in @xmath47 .",
    "these cuts leave us with an essentially volume - limited sample of 28,911 galaxies with @xmath57 which we divide into @xmath58 equal redshift bins .",
    "figure [ fig : red_seq ] shows the @xmath27 weighted rest - frame color - magnitude diagrams for the lowest ( @xmath8 ) and highest ( @xmath9 ) redshift bins as function of morphology and environment .",
    "figure [ fig : evol ] shows the redshift evolution of the number fractions of @xmath59 ( `` bulge - dominated '' ) galaxies and red ( rest - frame @xmath10 ) galaxies as a function of luminosity and environment .",
    "we stress the quantitative nature of our morphological classification scheme in that it measures the concentration of the galaxy light profiles as parameterized by the srsic index @xmath3 .",
    "we chose @xmath60 as our morphological discrimant between `` bulge '' and `` disk '' dominated galaxies to be fully consistent with @xcite who studied similar morphology - color - magnitude relations for sdss galaxies ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "their results are also plotted in figure [ fig : evol]a .",
    "we find good quantitative agreement ( within the errors ) for our @xmath62 number fractions when extrapolated down to the sdss redshift of @xmath15 .",
    "we summarize our main results as follows :    \\1 . within the entire @xmath12 sample",
    "the @xmath4 galaxy number fraction remains constant with redshift to within @xmath63 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : evol]a ) .",
    "at all redshifts , field populations have the lowest @xmath4 fraction and this fraction remains constant with redshift .",
    "however , for overdense environments this fraction is larger and consistently increases towards lower redshifts , higher densities and higher luminosities showing that a strong morphological evolution has taken place since @xmath7 . in overdense regions",
    "we observe that for @xmath57 the `` bulge- '' vs. `` disk - dominated '' galaxy ratio has increased by as much as a factor of @xmath64 among bright @xmath65 populations relative to @xmath12 populations .",
    "at all redshifts , cluster - like environments also contain the highest fraction of red ( @xmath10 ) galaxies . with mostly blue ( @xmath66 ) galaxies at @xmath7 , the red fraction increases towards lower redshifts and higher luminosities .",
    "the red fraction within cluster - like regions changes faster with redshift as compared to the field .",
    "we quantify this by fitting a line with slope @xmath67 to the observed color evolutions and find @xmath68 for @xmath12 .",
    "we note the presence of a break at @xmath69 which marks a period of a less strong ( @xmath70 ) color evolution down to @xmath71 .",
    "the results discussed in 1 and 2 qualitatively agree with the postulations and predictions made by hierarchical formation models ( e.g. kauffmann & charlot 1998 ; cole et al . 2000 ) where galaxies are initially formed as blue star - forming systems with @xmath72 or `` disk - dominated '' profiles .",
    "the observed trends show that the onset of a population s morphological evolution depends strongly on environment with the cluster - like environments exhibiting the strongest evolution .",
    "the latter would indicate that `` bulge - dominated '' galaxies are assembled at earlier times in denser environments which is in agreement with the predictions made by hierarchical merging models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more specifically , they predict that mergers erase any galaxy disk signatures and lead to more spheroidal structures such as bulges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and that higher merger rates associated with denser environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) result in earlier onsets of morphological transformation .",
    "mergers also lead to increased galaxy luminosity through the addition of stellar mass and ultimately result in more luminous and `` bulge - dominated '' populations .",
    "our observations support this merging scenario .",
    "\\3 . in all environments ,",
    "the color distribution of the observed galaxies is bimodal out to @xmath7 with a ` gap ' at @xmath73 which is in agreement with the observations of @xcite .",
    "rest - frame color - magnitude diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig : red_seq ] ) show that there exists a prominent red - sequence of galaxies at @xmath8 and a large blue - peak dominance at @xmath9 .",
    "equivalent color - magnitude diagrams for the redshift range @xmath74 ( not included here ) show bimodal distributions intermediate between these low and high redshift bins .",
    "the red peak ( @xmath10 ) of this bimodality appears to be greatly reduced towards higher redshifts and is predominantly being ` built up ' from `` bulge - dominated '' galaxies with decreasing redshift .",
    "this build - up proceeds more rapidly in more overdense environments .    based on their examination of the color bimodality , @xcite concluded that a combination of the interaction / merging of passively evolving galaxies and the truncation of their star formation would explain the main features of their observed color distribution .",
    "they suggest that the truncation may be associated with mergers that consume all the gas in an induced starburst .",
    "it is therefore interesting that we observe a strong color - magnitude relation ( brighter being redder ) at all redshifts and within all environments with a clear increase of the color evolutionary rate towards denser environments .",
    "the latter would agree well with an enhanced truncation of the star formation within denser environments .",
    "in addition to higher merger rates , denser environments also have other processes such as ram - pressure and that can affect galaxies travelling through their hot intergalactic medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the picture emerging from results presented here and elsewhere is one that supports basic tenets of hierarchical galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the cfhtls - deep is an ongoing project , and the final dataset will allow us to quadruple our sample size with even greater sky coverage and depth . as is ,",
    "our results show for the first time the redshift evolution of the color - magnitude - morphology relation over a single cosmological volume large enough to encompass many different environments ranging from the field to the most massive clusters .",
    "we would like to thank cfht staff and members of the cfhtls community involved in the planning and execution of survey observations and data processing .",
    "m. j. h. m. n. would especially like to thank the herzberg institute of astrophysics ( nrc - hia ) for their hospitality and financial support during the time when this work was conducted .",
