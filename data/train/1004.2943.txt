    "in bayesian statistics and statistical inference within the framework , to evaluate the expectation of microscopic labels ( such as ` pixels ' or ` bits ' ) over the posterior distribution of these microscopic states or to calculate the marginal probability is very important procedure to solve various problems in the research field of ` massive ' probabilistic information processing @xcite . for most of the cases ,",
    "it is very hard for us to carry out the task except for several limited cases of solvable probabilistic models .",
    "recently , to overcome the difficulty , deterministic approaches based on mean - field approximation including the belief - propagation succeeded in dealing with the problems efficiently @xcite .    on the other hand , in a lot of research fields , the markov chain monte carlo method ( the mcmc ) has been widely used to calculate these expectations or to make marginal distributions by sampling the important states that contribute effectively to the macroscopic quantities @xcite . generally speaking",
    ", the mcmc takes a long time to wait until the markovian stochastic process starts to generate the microscopic states from well - approximated posterior distribution .",
    "especially , for some classes of probabilistic models which are categorized in the so - called _ spin glasses _",
    "@xcite , the time consuming is sometimes very serious to make attempt to proceed the desired information processing within a realistic time .",
    "however , even for such cases , various improvements based on several important concepts have been proposed and succeeded in carrying out the numerical calculations @xcite . from the view point of statistical physics ,",
    "transitions between microscopic states are controlled by a specific hyper - parameter , namely , ` temperature ' of the system and by cooling the temperature slowly enough during the markovian stochastic process , one can get the lowest energy states efficiently .",
    "this type of optimization tool based on ` thermal fluctuation ' is referred to as _ simulated annealing _",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , the simulated annealing has been extended to the quantum - mechanical version . this new type of simulated annealing called as _ quantum annealing _",
    "@xcite is based on the adiabatic theorem of the quantum system that evolves according to schr@xmath2dinger equations . to use the quantum annealing , or more generally , to utilize the quantum fluctuation for combinatorial optimization problems or massive information processing dealing with a huge number of particles such as image restoration or error - correcting codes ,",
    "the approach by solving the schr@xmath2dinger equations is apparently limited and we should look for different ways to simulate the quantum systems .    as the most effective and efficient way , the quantum monte carlo method @xcite was established .",
    "the method is based on the following suzuki - trotter decomposition for non - commutative two operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 : @xmath5 namely , the @xmath6-dimensional quantum system is mapped to the corresponding @xmath1-dimensional classical spin systems .",
    "this approach is very powerful and a lot of researches have succeeded in exploring the quantum phases in strongly correlated quantum systems .",
    "however , when we simulate the quantum system at zero temperature in which quantum effect is essential , we encounter some technical difficulties although several sophisticated algorithms were proposed @xcite . from the view point of information science , it is very informative for us to evaluate the process of information processing and if one seeks to utilize the quantum fluctuation to solve the problems , we should use the ` zero - temperature dynamics ' . for this purpose , it seems that we need some tractable ` bench mark tests ' to investigate the ` dynamical process ' of information processing such as quantum annealing by using quantum fluctuation at zero temperature .    in classical system ,",
    "coolen and ruijgrok @xcite proposed a way to derive the differential equations with respect to order - parameters of the system from the microscopic master equations for the so - called hopfield model @xcite as an associative memory in which a finite number of patterns are embedded .",

    "was now established as a strong approach to investigate the dynamics in the classical disordered spin systems . on the considering the matter , it seems to be very important for us to extend their approach to quantum systems evolving stochastically according to the quantum monte carlo dynamics .    in this paper , in terms of the stochastic process of quantum - mechanical version of markov chain monte carlo method , we analytically derive macroscopically deterministic flow equations of order parameters such as spontaneous magnetization in infinite - range ( @xmath0-dimensional ) quantum spin systems . by means of the trotter decomposition",
    ", we consider the transition probability of glauber - type dynamics of microscopic states for the corresponding @xmath1-dimensional classical system . under the static approximation , differential equations with respect to macroscopic order parameters",
    "are explicitly obtained from the master equation that describes the microscopic - law . in the steady state , we show that the equations are identical to the saddle point equations ( equations of states ) for the equilibrium state of the same system .",
    "we easily find that the equation for the dynamical ising model is recovered in the classical limit .",
    "we also check the validity of the static approximation by computer simulations for finite size systems and discuss several possible extensions of our approach to disordered spin systems for statistical - mechanical informatics @xcite . especially , we shall use our procedure to evaluate the decoding process of bayesian image restoration @xcite . with the assistance of the concept of dynamical replica theory ( the drt ) @xcite , we derive the zero - temperature flow equation of image restoration measure , namely , overlap function between a given original image and the degraded one , showing some ` non - monotonic ' behaviour in its time evolution .",
