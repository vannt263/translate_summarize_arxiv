    "hr 4796a ( spectral type a0v ) is the primary member of a binary system with a parallactic distance of 72.8 @xmath3 1.7 pc in the newly revised hipparcos catalog by @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the distance has changed by more than 1@xmath4 from the determination of 67.1 @xmath5 pc in the original hipparcos catalog of @xcite .",
    "its age , based upon that of its 77 distant m2.5v coeval companion , is estimated at 8 @xmath3 2 myr @xcite .",
    "the likely existence of a dusty debris disk around hr 4796a was inferred by @xcite from its thermal infrared signature .",
    "he and collaborators @xcite later suggested grain growth into larger particles at distances 40200 au from the central star .",
    "these predictions were borne out from 1020  @xmath6 m mid - ir observations by @xcite and @xcite indicative of dust emission in a radial region bounded at 5580 au ( now 60  87 with the revised distance ) .",
    "coronagraphic observations by @xcite , with the hubble space telescope s ( _ hst _ ) near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) at 1.1 and 1.6 @xmath6 m ( spatial resolutions 110 and 160 mas , respectively ) , directly imaged the dust , revealing a ring , 105 ( 76 au ) in radius , with a width , as measured by its photometric fwhm , of @xmath717 au ( now @xmath718.5 au ) .",
    "the nicmos imagery also suggested that the ne side of the disk was brighter than the sw ; a similar brightness asymmetry was seen in mid - ir observations by @xcite and modeled by @xcite",
    ". preferential `` forward '' scattering by the dust grains was considered in models of the disk by @xcite .",
    "we obtained high spatial ( @xmath8 70 mas ) resolution optical images of the hr 4796a debris ring using the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) in its coronagraphic imaging mode . from these data",
    "we examine in more detail the spatial distribution of the ring particles as inferred from spatially resolved imaging photometry along ( and around ) the ring .",
    "we confirm , and better quantify , the geometrical parameters defining the ring system and also measure two anisotropies in the photometric properties along the ring .",
    "finally , we take this opportunity to discuss some of the details , intricacies , and methodologies employed in the reduction , processing , and analysis of hst / stis coronagraphic imaging data",
    ". these will be the highest angular resolution visible - light images of the ring for some time .",
    "hst s advanced camera for surveys coronagraph provides a 09 radius image plane mask , but has an effective inner working angle of @xmath912 , limited mainly by point spread function ( psf ) subtraction residuals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the hr 4796a disk is too small to be seen with that system .",
    "a program of high spatial resolution imaging of the hr 4796a circumstellar debris ring was carried out using stis in its coronagraphic imaging mode as part of hst general observer program 8624 ( pi : weinberger ) . with a foreknowledge of the ring geometry ,",
    "an optimized imaging sequence was planned and executed using broadband optical coronagraphy ( unfiltered spectral passband covering @xmath8 2000 ",
    "10500    with a pivot wavelength ( @xmath10 ) of 5752   , where @xmath10 is defined such that f@xmath11=f@xmath12/@xmath13 , and fwhm=4330   ) .",
    "observations of hr 4796a were obtained at two epochs , 2001 feb 17 and 2001 feb 27 , at spacecraft orientations differing by 16@xmath14 , thereby rotating the debris ring orientation at the detector focal plane with respect to the stis coronagraphic occulting wedge . at each epoch the orientation of the telescope was selected to simultaneously place the hr 4796a ring ansae at a maximum angular distances from the stis coronagraphic `` a '' wedge and from the stellar diffraction spikes ( see table [ tab_logobs ] ) .",

    "re - registered images at two field orientations provide better sampling of the psf and also facilitate discriminating optical artifacts in the hst / stis psf from true circumstellar features .",
    "observations of a brighter star of nearly identical spectral type , hr 4748 ( to serve as a point spread function ( psf ) subtraction template ) were obtained at each epoch . to minimize temporal variations in the hst / stis psf structure due to `` breathing '' of the telescope assembly @xcite and small instabilities in the projected position of the stis wedge onto the ccd focal plane , at each epoch both hr 4796a and",
    "hr 4748 were observed during the same uninterrupted target visibility period .",
    "this entailed a small spacecraft slew of 1.3  to hr 4748 following our hr 4796a observations ( maintaining essentially the same spacecraft sun angle for both pointings ) with subsequent guide star and coronagraphic target acquisitions occurring without an intervening earth occultation .    on - board autonomous target acquisitions placed the stars on the mid - line of the the standard coronagraphic `` a '' wedge where its tapered width narrows to 10 .",
    "each target was then moved 74 along the wedge mid - line to a location where the wedge is only 063 wide .",
    "target placement at this `` non - standard '' location along the wedge was used to maximize the visible portion of the small hr 4796a ring .",
    "the target and psf template star placements behind the occulting wedge were all within the nominal ( 27 mas , 3 @xmath4 ) combined stis acquisition and pointing precision of the telescope .    the exposure sequences are given in table [ tab_logobs ] and summarized here .",
    "with the star occulted by the coronagraphic wedge , images were obtained with the unfiltered stis ccd for total integration times of 108s for hr 4796a and 75.6s for hr 4748 at each epoch .",
    "each individual image was 6 s ( hr 4796a ) or 4.2 s ( hr 4748 ) in duration , and the 18 individual images were used for cosmic ray rejection and compensation .",
    "the individual exposures were planned to yield 72% of full - well depth at edge of the wedge based upon ground - based photometry of the target stars and estimates of the anticipated instrumentally scattered and diffracted stellar light .    except for the field orientations and integration times ,",
    "the hr 4796a and hr 4748 exposures taken at the two epochs were executed in an identical manner , as detailed in table 1 . to reduce",
    "lost time in operational overheads , we employed a sub - array readout mode of 80 rows centered on the target position . as a result , the known m - star companion to hr 4796a @xcite does not appear in the images .",
    "in addition to the coronagraphic images , target acquisition images of both stars ( at both epochs ) were obtained in the f25nd3 filter .",
    "broadband images of these bright stars could not be obtained without saturating the detector .",
    "the raw ccd frames were processed with the stsdas _ calstis _ software task using library flat field and dark current reference files from stsci s calibration data base and nearly contemporaneous hot / bad pixel maps provided by the stis instrument definition team ( idt ) . at each epoch",
    "the individual images were combined for cosmic - ray rejection using the stsdas _ crreject _ task and pixel values were converted to instrumental count rates ( counts / second ) .",
    "unrejected bad / hot pixels remaining in the combined count rate images were replaced by two - dimensional gaussian weighted interpolation ( with a weighting radius of 3 pixels ) of neighboring good pixels .",
    "a residual frame - dependent fixed bias offset in the images was removed by subtracting a constant to force the background to zero far from location of the star .",
    "the calibrated count rate images of hr 4796a and hr 4748 ( re - normalized to the flux density of hr 4796a ) at both epochs ( and hence different field orientations ) are shown in figure [ fig_rawimages ] . though embedded in a wash of scattered and diffracted light from the core of the stellar psf",
    "not rejected by the coronagraph , the hr 4796a ring is clearly visible in both hr 4796a frames ( panels a and b ) .",
    "the hr 4796a field ( and hence the orientation of the ring ) is rotated 16  between the two epochs , whereas the underlying structure of the hst+stis psf remains fixed on the detector .",
    "the rotational invariance of the stellar component of the psf is apparent when comparing this to the contemporaneous observations of the reference star hr 4748 panels c and d of figure [ fig_rawimages ] .      for each epoch ,",
    "the calibrated hr 4748 images were simultaneously flux - scaled , astrometrically registered , and subtracted from their corresponding hr 4796a images with sub - pixel re - registration and resampling accomplished by sync - function apodized cubic convolution interpolation @xcite as implemented in the nicmos idt s idp3 software @xcite . to make the best subtractions , we measured and iteratively minimized the psf - subtracted diffraction spikes at radii of 1530 pixels from the star ( a region unaffected by disk flux but close to the radii at which the disk is brightest ) , as a function of the position and flux scaling of the psf template star .",
    "this was done separately for each visit - pair of target - template subtractions .",
    "other means of optimizing the psf subtractions , included flux scaling using the total energy along the diffraction spikes beyond a radius of 30 pixels while demanding that the median flux density of the background region to be statistically zero , give very similar results .",
    "the best hr 4748:hr 4796a 50ccd band flux - density scaling was found to be 0.705 .",
    "this is in statistical agreement with the f25nd3 ratio found from the target acquisition images .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in this scaling as @xmath3 0.002 by trying different minimization radii and widths .",
    "for the 17 february visit , the determined positional offsets of the psf star to hr 4796 were @xmath16=-0.360 and @xmath17=+0.388 pixels .",
    "for the 27 february visit , the offsets were @xmath16=-0.075 and @xmath17=0.000 .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in all target : psf star position offsets as @xmath3 0.020 pixels in both orthogonal directions from examination of contours of @xmath18 as a function of different positions .",
    "the relatively large ( @xmath8 18 mas ) offsets on 17 feb resulted from a target miscentering in the autonomous acquisition process that , unfortunately , introduced additional optical artifacts near the edge of the occulting wedge . the positions , scale - lengths , and amplitudes of the optical artifacts due to mis - centering under the wedge are different from those which are induced by `` breathing '' and are in discussed in  [ artifacts ] .",
    "our final image of the hr 4796a circumstellar ring is the average of the two visits ; it is shown in figure [ fig_finalimg ] and used for all further analysis in this paper .",
    "when averaging the two psf - subtracted images , we masked out pixels unobserved due to the occulting wedge , pixels affected by the diffraction spikes and pixels degraded by wedge - edge artifacts in the individual subtractions .",
    "the visit 12 subtraction was registered to the position of the occulted star in the visit 11 subtraction and rotated to the same celestial orientation .",
    "residual low spatial frequency systematic artifacts remain in the combined image .",
    "these artifacts arise , primarily , from the interaction of two effects : different centerings under the wedge of hr 4796a and the reference psf and a slight defocus ( breathing excursion ) in the visit 12 psf relative to hr 4796a image taken in the same visibility period .",
    "they may be thought of as comprised of several `` features '' .",
    "most obvious among them are the radial `` spokes . ''",
    "we also see a radial modulation of the background intensities , and a `` hemispheric '' bias in that modulation due to decentering . as a result",
    ", it is not possible to simultaneously obtain zero nulling of the backgrounds at all radii with the subtraction method described in   [ subtractions ] . the psf - subtracted `` input '' images employed global nulling and minimization in their creation ,",
    "but they do not show `` optimal '' subtraction in all radial zones .",
    "the specific spatial nature of these residuals is complex .",
    "building a multi - parameter ( or multi - dimensional ) model in the hopes of achieving truly global background minimization is likely infeasible because many instrumental effects , such as wavelength and position dependent wedge- edge scattering that remain uncharacterized .",
    "we accept that a global fully - optimized psf - subtracted image may not be achievable .",
    "the ne side of the ring is less affected by residual diffraction and instrumental scattering artifacts than the sw side of the ring .",
    "the appearance of the artifacts in the psf - subtracted images may be better understood by examining paired - subtractions of the individual hr 4748 psfs ( figure [ fig_intermedimages ] ) . because the star positions in the two visits were offset in x with respect to the wedge centerline , one edge of the wedge appears bright , and the other dark after registration and subtraction .",
    "the stellar positions were also offset in y ( along the wedge ) changing , in detail , the scattered light profile from the edge of the wedge .",
    "additionally , a very small focus change occurred causing the asymmetrical appearance of the + 45  and -45  diffraction spike residuals . despite these non - repeatabilities ,",
    "the registration process mimics the minimization of the radial streaks as was done for the hr 4796a psf subtractions .",
    "figure [ fig_intermedimages ] illustrates the nature and spatial distribution of the subtraction residuals within 1@xmath19 of the star before combination into the final image .",
    "small differences between the individual psf subtracted images are seen .",
    "also shown are the azimuthally changing influences of image artifacts within each psf subtracted image . for example , due to the visit a1 decentering of the hr 4748 reference psf with respect to the mid - line of the wedge , the resulting low - amplitude , large spatial scale , negative residuals in the psf subtraction are less pronounced on either side of the ne ansa ; i.e. , locally , this is a `` cleaner '' psf subtraction then around the sw ansa .",
    "the artifacts in individual subtractions are partially self - canceling in weighted average combination , but unfortunately not completely so .",
    "note in figure [ fig_intermedimages ] that the negative - going residuals at radii just at and marginally beyond the sw ansa are of larger amplitude in the subtractions using the visit a2 reference psf ( panels b and c ) , and more noticeable in panel b because of the lower amplitude of the radial spokes as the hr 4796a - to - hr 4748 relative centering was very precise .",
    "a dark ( negative ) zone is seen abutting the ne ansa in the subtractions of the visit a1 psf ( panels a and d ) , where the reference psf star was significantly offset from the wedge center . finally ,",
    "note , that there is a zone of positive residuals seen in the panel d subtraction to the sw just outside of the radius of the negative zone .",
    "we exploit the high spatial resolution of the stis data to improve upon the initial determination of the geometrical parameters of the ring derived from the nicmos scattered - light images by @xcite . by ring geometry",
    "we mean : ( _ a _ ) the location of its center ( determined separately from the position of the star ) , ( _ b _ ) its ellipticity ( apparent eccentricity ; we interpret the apparent ellipticity as evidence for a disk which is intrinsically circular ( or nearly so ) and inclined to our line of sight and use it to calculate an inclination ) , ( _ c _ ) the major axis length - corresponding to the ridge of maximum surface brightness in a deprojected ellipse , and ( _ d _ ) the major axis celestial position angle of the apparent ellipse .",
    "we determined the geometry of the ring in two ways :    first , we fit ellipses to the ring isophotes at the 25 , 50 , 75 ( interior and exterior to the peak ) , and 100% flux density levels normalized at each azimuth ( in 5  deprojected increments ; see figure [ fig_deprojected ] ) to the maximum intensity at each position angle in each azimuthal bin . in doing",
    "so we exclude data behind and immediately adjacent to the coronagraphic wedge and diffraction spikes .",
    "all of the geometrical parameters , except the semi - major , axis were determined from the mean of the seven isophotal fits ; the semi - major axis length ( which corresponds to a deprojected radius of maximum surface brightness ) was determined from the 100% isophotal contour alone ( shown in figure [ fig_fitellipse ] ) .",
    "the seven fit ellipses were concentric to within 6 mas .",
    "second , we built a model of the disk assuming an elliptical ring with a surface brightness profile across the ring described by a gaussian .",
    "the model geometry is defined by 5 free parameters , corresponding to those independently measured as described above : ellipse center ( x and y ) , semi - major axis length and orientation , and inclination .",
    "the disk model also includes two other free parameters ; the ring gaussian width and overall intensity normalization ( i.e. , a scale factor to match the total disk flux density ) . for this purpose , we modeled the forward scattering with a henyey - greenstein prescription ( see  4.3 ) . finally , we modeled the ansal asymmetry as a smooth sine function peaked along the major axis at the ne ansa and decreasing to the sw side with an amplitude equal to the photometrically measured asymmetry ( see  4.4 ) .",
    "the model free parameters were iteratively adjusted to fit the observational data with chi - square minimization .",
    "the geometrical parameters determined by the two independent methods agree very well , and the averages from the two methods ( and their resulting uncertainties ) are presented in table [ tab_geometry ] . in figure",
    "[ fig_fitellipse ] , we show the best - fit ellipse ( bfe , in black ) defined by the systemic parameters detailed in table 2 overlaid on 3.2% photometric intensity contours ( see scale bar in the figure ) .",

    "the stars themselves are hidden under the coronagraphic wedge during the observations , so their positions can not be measured directly .",
    "hence , we determined the location of hr 4796a in each visit by using the unocculted portions of the stellar diffraction spikes beyond the coronagraphic wedge .",
    "we assume the diffraction spikes are centered on the star . at every detector column",
    ", a slice was made through the spikes , and the center of the spike was found by fitting a gaussian profile to the slice .",
    "a least squares fit was made to the coordinates of the two orthogonal spikes , with the intersection defining the location of the star .",
    "the diffraction spikes are easily traced from a distance of 9 pixels ( 0.46  ) from the star ( beyond the edge of the occulting wedge ) to 44 pixels ( 2.23  ) at the edge of subarray used to read out the image .",
    "the formal uncertainty on the fit location of the center is 0.08 pixels in each coordinate from propagating the uncertainty in the two least squares fits .",
    "the wedge - occulted positions of hr 4796a resulting from the independent target acquisitions in visits 11 and 12 , as determined from the above diffraction spike fitting method , were found to be ( 306.41 , 41.28 ) @xmath3 ( 0.09 , 0.06 ) pixels and ( 306.09 , 40.01 ) @xmath3 ( 0.07 , 0.08 ) , respectively , in the stis ccd science instrument aperture frame ( siaf ) .",
    "the inferred target positioning offset between the two visits is therefore ( + 0.32,+1.27 ) @xmath3 ( 0.11 , 0.10 ) pixels .",
    "this offset was independently checked using the diffraction spike noise - minimization iterative - subtraction method described in  [ subtractions ] applied to the two hr 4796a visits ; from which a position offset of ( + 0.26 , + 1.30 ) pixels was found ( i.e within 1@xmath4 of the offset determined directly from diffraction spike fitting ) .",
    "we compare the position of the star to the geometrical center of the ring ellipse to investigate the possibility of a stellocentric offset such as seen in the case of the fomalhaut debris ring as discussed by @xcite .",
    "we found the distance between the two ring ansae and the star by placing the stellar center at the middle of a pixel and rotating the final image about the center so the major axis was horizontal .",
    "we took a one pixel slice along the major axis and fit the locations of the ansae in this slice with gaussians .",
    "we find that the ne ansa is 20.522 @xmath3 0.041 pixels ( 1040 @xmath3 0002 ) from the stellar center and the sw ansa is 21.287 @xmath3 0.069 pixels ( 1079 @xmath3 0003 ) from the stellar center , as shown in figure [ fig_ringoffset ] .",
    "these uncertainties are the formal uncertainties from the gaussian fit and do not include the uncertainty in the center found above . to make the ansae equidistant implies a ring center shifted away from the ne ansa by 0.38 @xmath3 0.12 pixels = 0019 @xmath3 0006 .",
    "because the portion of the ring along its minor axis is obscured by the coronagraphic wedge , we can not robustly set a limit on a star - ring offset in this direction .",
    "hr 4796a disk grains are radially confined to a narrow annular zone circumscribing the star .",
    "radially across the ne ( brighter ) ansa we measure a one pixel wide fwhm of the surface brightness profile as 0197 , but the brightness fall - off is somewhat steeper interior to the ring ansa then outward from it ( see fig [ fig_profiles ] ) , indicating a sharper interior cut - off than the outer truncation .",
    "in particular the measured hwhm interior to the ne ansa is 0089 whereas exterior to the ansa it is 0108 .",
    "an azimuthally averaged radial profile , extending in sectors @xmath315@xmath21 in elliptical coordinates derived from the geometrical eccentricity of the ring , about the ring ansae , is best fit to a broader gaussian with a fwhm of 0222 . taking individual one - pixel wide profiles",
    "( in 5@xmath21 deprojected increments ) around the ring , the fwhm of the radial surface brightness profiles is seen to be at a minimum through the ansae , and increases in radial profiles closer to the ring minor axis .",
    "these effects are opposite of what one would expect for a perfectly flat disk and likely indicates scattering from dust above the mid - plane of the disk .",
    "we characterize the width of the annular region confining most of the starlight - scattering dust by the intrinsic fwhm of the ring at the brighter ansa , which as measured is instrumentally broadened by the stis 50ccd ( unfiltered ) point spread function . subtracting the fwhm of the stis 50ccd psf ( 0070 ) in quadrature from the observationally measured width , we find the intrinsic characteristic ring width to be fwhm 0184 ( 13.4 @xmath3 0.8au , at the revised stellar parallax , or 8.7% of the ring diameter ) with corresponding hwhm[inner ] = 0082 and hwhm[outer ] = 0102 .",
    "this is consistent with the upper limit set by schneider et al .",
    "1999 from the lower spatial resolution nicmos images .      for an inclined disk , the side centered on scattering phase angle 0@xmath21 is seen primarily in forward scattered starlight while the other half , centered on scattering phase angle 180@xmath21 , is seen primarily in light that is backscattered .",
    "the hr 4796a scattered - light disk is clearly brighter on the east side ( both north and south of the minor axis ) than on the west side . to determine if the ring dust displays significant azimuthally non - isotropic scattering , we measured , and ratioed , the total flux density in symmetrically placed sectors within the four readily visible quadrants of the disk  between 5@xmath21 and 20@xmath21 from the major axis , and within 08 to 15 from the star .",
    "we characterize this asymmetry in terms of a henyey - greenstein phase function parameter , @xmath20 , at the best fit inclination of 14.1@xmath22 from edge - on .",

    ", we find a best fit for the measured inter - sector flux density ratios with @xmath20=0.16 @xmath3 0.06 , or evidence for forward scattering at the 2@xmath4 level of confidence .",
    "we also measured the ansa - to - ansa orientation angle , from the centroid of one ansa to the other , as 26.6 @xmath3 0.5 deg .",
    "the difference between this orientation and the pa of the best - fit disk ellipse ( 27.01 @xmath3 0.16 ; table [ tab_geometry ] ) is 0.4 @xmath3 0.5 deg . that these position angles agree",
    "is another indication that it is forward scattering that shifts the locations of the ansae away from the disk semi - major axis ( see yellow line in figure [ fig_deprojected ] ) .",
    "the ne side of the disk ( flanking the brighter ansa ) appears brighter than the sw side . to measure this asymmetry",
    ", we took the total flux density in the ne and sw `` lobes '' , within @xmath3 20@xmath21 of the major axis , and measured their ratios in those sectors between 08 to 15 from the star ( using the same background annulus as for the total disk photometry ) .",
    "the sw side is 0.74 @xmath3 0.07 as bright as the ne side .",
    "determining the flux density of the unobscured portion of the hr 4796a ring is most affected by two sources of systematic uncertainties in the measurements .",
    "intrinsically , the uncertainty in the brightness of the ring in the stis 50ccd instrumental system is dominated by optical artifacts arising from the imperfect psf subtractions ( i.e. , not by photon statistics or other `` random '' noise sources ) .",
    "extrinsically , effecting a photometric transfer from the instrumental system to a standard photometric system ( e.g. , johnson / vega ) is difficult because of the extreme breadth of the 50ccd bandpass ( fwhm = 75% of the pivot wavelength ) and because the intrinsic sed / color of the disk within that band is unknown .",
    "we address these systematic errors separately .",
    "we measure the 50ccd bandpass disk flux density in an elliptical aperture with the major : minor axis ratio and position angle as we determined for the disk , and an inner semi - major axis of 08 and an outer semi - major axis of 15 . inside 0@xmath248 ,",
    "pixel - to - pixel fluctuations dominate the flux density measures on pixel size scales , and outside 1@xmath245 , light from the disk is less than 5 - 10% of the peak surface brightness . since only part of the disk was visible , we restricted our aperture to be within 20@xmath21 of either side of each ansa .",
    "we used an elliptical annulus between 2@xmath2409 and 2@xmath2450 with the same azimuthal coverage to determine the background level of the image .    to estimate the systematic uncertainties introduced by psf subtraction",
    ", we create a grid of psf - subtracted images in which we : ( a ) offset the psf template relative to the best determined position by 1-sigma of the uncertainties in the x and y ( siaf ) co - aligned position determinations , and ( b ) re - scale the intensity of the psf template by 1-sigma from the best determined target : template scaling ratio .",
    "we use the resulting standard deviation of the pixels in our photometric aperture , over all the points in this grid , as an estimate of the per - pixel photometric systematic uncertainty .",
    "we then apply this uncertainty to each pixel in our photometric apertures .",
    "to convert from raw instrumental units of counts  s@xmath15  pixel@xmath15 to per - pixel flux density in physical units of mjy under the stis 50ccd ( unfiltered ) passband , we adopt the instrumental sensitivity and photometric zero point from version 7.0 ( october 2003 ) of the stis instrument handbook for a spectrally flat source : ab magnitude 26.386 = 1 count  s@xmath15 ( with an instrumental gain of 4.096 e@xmath25  count@xmath15 as used for all our observations ) , with a zero - point magnitude of 3631 jy .    the 50ccd band flux density of the visible portion of the disk unocculted by the coronagraphic wedge and within the photometric measurement aperture is then 5.47 @xmath3 0.24 mjy ( with the presumption of a flat spectrum ) .",
    "while this is likely to be very close to correct for an a0v ( b - v = 0.0 ) star , such as hr 4796a , the spectral reflectance of the disk grains in the broad optical to near - ir is red @xcite and will bias the flux density transformations into standard photometric bands .",
    "we use the _ calcphot _ task in the stsdas synphot synthetic photometry package ( which provides a high fidelity model of the stis instrumental response ) to estimate this photometric uncertainty . for disk grains as red as b - v = + 0.60 , the v - band brightness of the disk ( transformed from the broad 50ccd passband ) would be 0.047 magnitudes brighter then for grains with a spectrally neutral ( b - v = 0.0 ) reflectance ; i.e. , a 5% error in the absolute photometric calibration due to an uncertainty of this amount in the b - v color of the circumstellar debris .",
    "we compensate for the flux density originating from the unsampled portion of the disk using the geometrical parameters in table [ tab_geometry ] .",
    "we do this by building a model of the disk that includes : ( a ) a henyey - greenstein phase function with the @xmath20 value measured in section [ section_fs ] , ( b ) an ansal asymmetry characterized by a sine dependence and a maximum excursion given in section [ section_aa ] , ( c ) a width from the measured radial profile given in section [ geometry ] , and ( d ) size from the measurements described in section [ geometry ] .",
    "this model yields a total disk flux density 1.71 times greater than in the measured region alone ; if the entire spatial region of the disk could have been measured , we would therefore expect a 50ccd band total disk flux density of 9.4 @xmath3 0.8 mjy .",
    "the @xmath0 70 mas per resolution element stis observation of the hr 4796a debris disk better elucidates the morphology and geometry of the circumstellar ring than the longer wavelength nicmos observations .",
    "most , if not all , of the `` clumpiness '' seen in the @xcite near - ir images of the ring was then suggested as arising from optical artifacts in the nicmos psf subtractions , rather than intrinsic to the dust distribution , and that indeed appears to be the case .",
    "a hemispheric brightness asymmetry was suggested in both the nicmos f160w and f110w ( 1.6  @xmath6 m and 1.1  @xmath6 m ) bands at the 10 - 15% level as noted by @xcite .",
    "a similar brightness asymmetry was seen in the mid - ir and discussed by @xcite .",
    "this work shows the asymmetry in the broad - band optical to be about 25% .",
    "one model for the mid - infrared asymmetry was `` pericenter glow , '' a forced eccentricity of the disk that resulted in one side s grains lying closer to the star and therefore being heated to a higher temperature @xcite .",
    "to explain the mid - infrared observations of @xcite , required a radial offset asymmetry , @xmath26 = 6.4% @xcite .",
    "we measure the offset between the center of the ring and the star along the ring major axis to be 19 @xmath3 6 mas or 1.4 au ( figure [ fig_ringoffset ] ) , for a radial offset asymmetry of 3.7% .",
    "of course , the true displacement may include a component toward or away from us . in that case , what we interpret as forward scattering could be partially due to the east side of the disk being closer to the star than the west side .",
    "the magnitude of of such a shift is limited by the small asymmetry we measure .    in any case , the offset along the major axis of 3.7% causes a brightness asymmetry , just due to the @xmath27 dependence of the stellar brightness , of 14% , which is approximately half of the observed difference in the ansal brightnesses .    this asymmetry could also be due to an azimuthally inhomogeneous population of disk grains , or arise from a non - uniform spatial distribution of an intrinsically homogeneous population .",
    "given orbital periods of @xmath0350 years for ring particles at the characteristic radius of 76 au , and an age of the star of @xmath08 myr , one would expect the grains to be well mixed rather than azimuthally segregated populations of grains with different scattering efficiencies .",
    "we suggest the possibility that the hemispheric variation in surface brightness might arise , at least in part , from a dynamical redistribution of the grains , through perturbations or resonant interactions with co - orbital bodies , leading to azimuthally confined regions of enhanced particle densities . @xcite",
    "describe the effect of forced eccentricities from the companion , which might be sufficient to explain a portion of the asymmetry .",
    "@xcite , e.g. describe more generally how planets can concentrate dust at resonances .",
    "we note the appearance of a correlated decrement in the ring brightness at a position angle ( eastward from north ) of 230@xmath310  in both the nicmos f110w and stis 50ccd images ( figure [ fig_nicmos_stis ] ) .",
    "the statistical significance of this is not strong in the individual images ; however , the correlation of this `` feature '' in the two images , taken at significantly different field orientations , wavelengths ( psf subtraction artifacts spatially scale with wavelength ) , and instruments , is intriguing and suggests there might be a gap in the distribution of ring particles at that azimuth .",
    "this , perhaps , is further evidence ( albeit not very strong on its own ) of azimuthal sculpting of the grains by gravitational perturbation by one or more undetected bodies of planetary mass .",
    "this region is nearly opposite the bright ansa , and is in the direction of the companion m - star that sits 77 away at a pa = 225.4@xmath21 .      the central `` hole '' , seen to an inner radius of @xmath0 05 ( 35au ) in the 50ccd images",
    "is essentially cleared of circumstellar material which would otherwise scatter starlight .",
    "a similar central clearing is apparent ( as implied from the radial inward brightness fall - off ) in the @xcite 1.1 and 1.6  nicmos images .",
    "additionally , @xcite find a mid - ir optical depth in the central zone of @xmath2 3% from 10.8 and 18.2  @xmath6 m imaging .",
    "the disk s emitting regions are spatially coincident with the scattered light seen in the optical and near - ir .",
    "small particles may be cleared by radiation pressure and poynting - robertson drag acting on timescales much shorter than the estimated @xmath0 8  myr age of hr 4796a if the dust were not replenished and/or confined .",
    "the number of grains in the ring , as inferred from the mid - infrared observations , implies that the dust in the ring should be collisionally dominated .",
    "it is likely that mutual collisions disintegrate large grains until they are small enough to be removed by radiation pressure .",
    "then , the absence of dust interior to the starlight - scattering ring indicates a corresponding absence of large bodies located there @xcite .",
    "the outer `` truncation '' of the disk might be dynamically aided by hr 4796b , the m - star companion to hr 4796a noted by @xcite , though it is at a projected ( minimum ) distance of @xmath0 500 au .",
    "dynamical models of the ring must also reproduce the relatively sharp inner , and slightly less steep outer ring boundaries . such tight bounding",
    "might be manifested by the `` shepherding '' of the ring particles by co - orbital bodies @xcite , loosely analogous , for example , to structures seen in the saturnian rings , but here on solar system size scales .",
    "we have found the hr 4796a disk grains to be significantly red at optical to the near - ir wavelengths ; this result is discussed in some depth in a companion paper @xcite .",
    "intrinsically red grains are consistent with a collisionally evolved population of particles where the characteristic particle size is larger than the wavelengths of the observations , as opposed to neutral or blue grains which would be more typical of a primordial population of ism grains .",
    "hr 4796a s disk is not the only one to display such red colors .",
    "the more substantial disk around hd 100546 also shows red optical scattering @xcite , as do portions of the similarly thin @xmath28 pictoris disk @xcite .",
    "perhaps the reddening mechanism is common to both our outer solar system and the cool portions of younger disks around more luminous stars .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge contributions from members of the stis idt leading to a better understanding of some of the performance characteristics of the instrument , and in particular phil plait for assisting with some of the nuances of stis data calibration , and carol grady and randy kimball in regard to temporal stability and pointing precision issues .",
    "we also wish to thank other members of the nicmos idt for their suggestions and comments during the investigatory phases of this study , and specifically to marcia rieke for establishing the absolute photometric calibration of nicmos , and elizabeth stobie for implementing significant improvements to the idp3 software in support of this study .",
