    "when investigating the dynamical behavior of quantum systems of low to moderate dimension , very often it is necessary to solve numerically the time dependent schrdinger equation ( @xmath3 ) @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the hamiltonian operator , @xmath6 is the wave function representing the state of the system and @xmath7 is the initial state . for simplicity ,",
    "in the sequel we consider @xmath8 , with the kinetic energy operator @xmath9 for a reduced mass @xmath10 and a potential @xmath11 , although the procedure presented in this paper is also valid for more general hamiltonian operators .",
    "the solution of ( [ schr0 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath12 the ( unitary ) evolution operator @xmath13 being formally given by @xmath14 . in practice , however , it is not possible to get a closed expression for @xmath15 , and so numerical methods are applied to get reliable approximations .",
    "this process involves typically two stages . in the first a discrete spatial representation of the initial wave function @xmath7 and the operator @xmath5 on an appropriate grid",
    "are constructed . in the second ,",
    "this finite representation is propagated in time with a numerical integrator .    as for the space discretization process",
    ", several techniques can be used , depending on the particular problem one aims to analyze : finite difference schemes , spectral methods based on collocation with trigonometric polynomials , galerkin method with a hermite basis , etc , both in one or more dimensions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the space discretization process restricts the energy range of the approximation and imposes an upper bound to the high frequency components represented by the discrete solution .    in any event",
    ", once this process has been carried out , one has the linear system of ordinary differential equations @xmath16 where @xmath17 now represents a discretized version of the wave function @xmath18 at the @xmath19 space grid points , with @xmath19 usually a large number .",
    "the goal is then to compute @xmath17 at a given target time @xmath20 from the known value of @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22 matrix @xmath23 ( and in particular its discrete spectrum ) depends of course on the particular space discretization carried out .",
    "we will hereafter assume that @xmath23 is a real symmetric matrix which implies that it can be diagonalized with real eigenvalues .",
    "the exact solution of eq .",
    "( [ td.1 ] ) reads @xmath24 but computing the matrix exponential @xmath25 by diagonalizing @xmath23 ( usually , a matrix of large dimension and large norm ) is prohibitively expensive .",
    "an effective alternative consists in computing approximations of @xmath26 of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a polynomial in @xmath29 that approximates the exponential @xmath30 , since in that case only multiplications of the matrix @xmath23 with vectors @xmath31 are necessary .",
    "these products can be efficiently evaluated in complex variables ( provided that a fourier spectral method is used to obtain the discretized version ( [ td.1 ] ) of ( [ schr0 ] ) ) with the complex - to - complex fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "there are different choices for such a polynomial @xmath28 .",
    "for instance , one may consider truncated taylor or chebyshev series expansion of @xmath30 for an appropriate real interval of @xmath29 , or the lanczos method , where the polynomial is determined by a galerkin approximation on the krylov space spanned by @xmath32 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider yet another kind of polynomial approximation to @xmath33 , namely one based on explicit symplectic splitting methods @xcite .",
    "this approach can be applied under the same assumptions than the chebyshev method , the main difference being the following .",
    "whereas in the chebyshev ( or taylor ) method the approximation ( [ approx.1 ] ) is constructed by evaluating products of the form @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , with symplectic splitting methods one writes @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "the algorithm then proceeds by successively computing _ real _ matrix - vector products @xmath38 and @xmath39 with different weights , so that the real and imaginary parts of @xmath40 are approximated in a different way , with a much reduced computational cost .    more specifically , if a spatial discretization based on fourier spectral methods is considered , then the cost of computing @xmath34 , @xmath35 , amounts essentially to one complex - to - complex fft and its inverse , whereas in the case of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , one has to evaluate one real - to - complex fft and its inverse complex - to - real fft , and this process requires half the computing time of the fully complex case . as a result , the proposed algorithm based on splitting methods turns out to be between @xmath43 and 2 times faster than the chebyshev method for the same accuracy in all the examples we have analyzed .",
    "moreover , the procedure is easy to implement and the resulting approximations preserve important qualitative properties of the exact solution .",
    "the algorithm we present here has embedded several symplectic splitting schemes designed according to different optimization criteria with the purpose of covering most of the cases one finds in practical applications ( high accuracy over long time intervals , low accuracy over short times , etc . ) .",
    "the computation of the coefficients of the methods , which constitutes a non - trivial task by itself , is largely based on the stability and error analysis of splitting methods carried out in @xcite .",
    "given a target value of time @xmath20 and an error tolerance , the algorithm selects a specific symplectic splitting scheme leading to a numerical solution with the prescribed accuracy and the minimum computational work , measured as the number of real matrix - vector products . by construction",
    ", the algorithm developed here is aimed to be applied for the same problems and under the same assumptions as the chebyshev method , with a remarkable gain in efficiency for all the examples we have tested .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . since our procedure",
    "may be considered as an alternative to the chebyshev method , in section  [ sec.2 ] we summarize the main features of the schemes based on this polynomial approximation of @xmath44 . in section  [ sec.3 ]",
    "we analyze the stability and the global error of symplectic splitting methods in this context , and the actual algorithm is presented , whereas the comparison with chebyshev ( and taylor as a reference ) is carried out in section  [ sec.5 ] on a pair of selected numerical examples .",
    "given a @xmath45th degree polynomial @xmath46 approximating @xmath30 , the solution @xmath47 of ( [ td.1 ] ) at a prescribed target time @xmath20 can be approximated as @xmath48 with the corresponding error ( in euclidean norm ) bounded as @xmath49 in terms of the ( real ) eigenvalues @xmath50 of @xmath51 .",
    "assuming that the spectrum @xmath52 is contained in an interval of the form @xmath53 $ ] , then @xmath54 there are several possibilities to estimate @xmath55 and @xmath56 for different classes of matrices ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath23 can be decomposed as the sum @xmath57 of two symmetric matrices with known lower and upper bounds for their eigenvalues , @xmath56 ( resp .",
    "@xmath55 ) can be simply obtained as the sum of the lower ( resp .",
    "upper ) bounds of the eigenvalues of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this happens , in particular , when the hamiltonian operator @xmath60 is discretized by spectral fourier collocation with @xmath19 fourier modes , in which case @xmath61 in any event , once @xmath56 and @xmath55 have been determined , we introduce @xmath62 so that the spectrum of the shifted operator @xmath63 is contained in an interval centered at the origin , @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "we thus have @xmath65 hence , we will hereafter assume without loss of generality that our problem consists in approximating @xmath66 for a real symmetric matrix @xmath51 with @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "in that case , @xmath68 where @xmath69      the @xmath45th degree taylor polynomial @xmath70 corresponding to @xmath30 is of course @xmath71 and horner s algorithm provides an efficient way to compute @xmath72 , namely @xmath73 the process requires storing three complex vectors ( or equivalently , 6 real vectors ) .",
    "an error estimate of the form ( [ eq : err1 ] ) can be obtained with @xmath74 in ( [ eq : err2 ] ) replaced by its upper bound @xmath75 since @xmath76 for large values of @xmath45 @xcite , we can write @xmath77 in consequence , we can not expect to have a reasonably accurate approximation @xmath78 of @xmath79 unless @xmath80 in other words , increasing the value of the target time @xmath20 where the solution is to be found and/or refining the spatial discretization ( so that @xmath81 gets larger ) requires evaluating a higher degree taylor polynomial .",
    "the chebyshev polynomial expansion scheme , proposed for the first time in the context of the schrdinger equation in @xcite , constitutes a standard tool to compute ( [ td.2 ] ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of the procedure , including error estimates for the problem at hand , can be found in @xcite . for completeness , we review here some of its main features .",
    "the @xmath45th degree truncation of the chebyshev series expansion of @xmath30 in the interval @xmath82 $ ] is given by @xmath83 where for each @xmath84 , @xmath85 is the bessel function of the first kind @xcite and @xmath86 is the @xmath84th chebyshev polynomial generated from the recursion @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "according with the analysis in @xcite , @xmath89 can be approximated by @xmath90 with an error estimate of the form ( [ eq : err1 ] ) , where @xmath91 in ( [ eq : err2 ] ) is replaced by its upper bound @xmath92 in figure  [ fig : mtaychev ] we depict the minimum degree @xmath45 as a function of @xmath93 of chebyshev approximations for prescribed tolerances @xmath94 , so that @xmath95 ( continuous lines ) in comparison with the corresponding degree @xmath45 for taylor approximations ( dashed lines ) such that @xmath96 . notice that chebyshev always gives a similar accuracy with a lower degree polynomial ( hence , with less computational cost ) , with a gain in efficiency of up to a factor of two for sufficiently large values of @xmath97 .",
    "once the degree of the polynomial @xmath45 has been chosen , given a certain error tolerance , target time @xmath98 , and bound @xmath81 of @xmath99 , one has to compute @xmath100 in an as efficient as possible way .",
    "this can be done with the clenshaw recursive algorithm as follows : first evaluate the coefficients @xmath101 for @xmath102 and then compute recursively @xmath103 which produces @xmath104 as output .",
    "clenshaw algorithm keeps only four complex vectors in memory , but the whole procedure has to be carried out for each value of @xmath45 .",
    "since the coefficients @xmath105 are relatively small as @xmath84 grows , the clenshaw algorithm is stable and so it is possible to work with polynomials of very high degree ( even in the thousands ) provided the bessel functions are accurately computed .",
    "an alternative to chebyshev polynomial approximations of @xmath106 first considered in @xcite consists in applying specially designed splitting methods to numerically integrate the system ( [ td.1 ] ) recast in a more suitable form .    by considering @xmath107 and @xmath108 , equation ( [ td.1 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath109 where @xmath110 the solution @xmath111 of ( [ td.1b ] ) can be written in terms of the orthogonal and symplectic matrix @xmath112 as @xmath113 . to introduce general symplectic splitting methods in this setting ,",
    "let us first show how the well known strang splitting can be used to approximate @xmath114 . let @xmath45 be a sufficiently large positive integer , so that for @xmath115 , we consider the approximation @xmath116 it is then clear that @xmath117 or equivalently , @xmath118 with @xmath119 due to the nilpotent structure of the matrices @xmath120 and @xmath121 in ( [ m.a.b ] ) , the exponentials in the definition ( [ compos ] ) of @xmath122 take a particularly simple form , namely @xmath123 this analysis shows that the approximation @xmath124 can be computed with the following procedure , similar in nature and equivalent in computing time to the horner ( [ alg : horner ] ) and clenshaw ( [ alg : clenshaw ] ) algorithms : given @xmath125 , @xmath126 producing @xmath127 as output .",
    "notice that it only requires storing three real vectors of dimension @xmath19 ( namely @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 or @xmath131 ) instead of seven real vectors for the clenshaw algorithm and six real vectors for the horner algorithm .",
    "it is worth remarking that , since @xmath132 and @xmath133 are symplectic matrices , @xmath134 is also symplectic .",
    "unitarity is no longer preserved by this scheme , but neither the average error in energy nor the norm of the solution increases with time , since it is conjugate to a unitary method @xcite .    in practice , and in the same way as other polynomial approximations , it is convenient to apply algorithm ( [ alg : splitting ] ) with the original @xmath23 replaced by the shifted version @xmath63 considered in ( [ shifting ] ) ( and then make use of the equality ( [ td.2cheb ] ) ) , so that the spectrum of @xmath63 is contained in an interval of the form @xmath135 $ ] with @xmath81 as sharp as possible .",
    "therefore , in what follows we always assume that @xmath136 $ ] .",
    "although algoritm ( [ alg : splitting ] ) with coefficients ( [ eq : abstrang ] ) can be used in principle to approximate @xmath137 , we next show that , for given values of @xmath45 and @xmath97 , much better approximations can be obtained if other sequences of coefficients @xmath138 are chosen instead . to see how this can be done ,",
    "an error estimate of the corresponding approximation ( [ compos ] ) is necessary first .      for a given finite sequence of real numbers @xmath139 algorithm ( [ alg : splitting ] )",
    "produces an approximation of the form @xmath140 ( or equivalently , @xmath141 ) with @xmath142 here @xmath143 , @xmath144 are even polynomials of degree @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 are odd polynomials of degree @xmath148 and @xmath149 respectively , and @xmath150 .",
    "it is important to remark that for a given positive integer @xmath45 , compared to horner s ( [ alg : horner ] ) and clenshaw s ( [ alg : clenshaw ] ) algorithms , the degree of the polynomials involved in an @xmath45-stage splitting method ( [ eq : sequence ] ) is _ twice _ the degree of the corresponding taylor and chebyshev polynomials , with the same computational cost .",
    "we next focus on obtaining upper bounds for the error @xmath151 in euclidean norm .",
    "since @xmath23 is assumed to be a real symmetric matrix , it can be diagonalized as @xmath152 where @xmath153 is an orthogonal @xmath154 matrix .",
    "we thus have @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the block - diagonal matrix ( with @xmath157 matrices at the diagonal ) @xmath158 and therefore @xmath159 since @xmath160 , @xmath161 , we finally arrive at @xmath162 where @xmath163    by taking into account that @xmath164 , the 2-norm of the @xmath165 matrix @xmath166 can be explicitly computed to give @xmath167 where @xmath168 notice that @xmath164 implies @xmath169 and thus @xmath170 for all real values of @xmath29 .      ideally , given a positive integer @xmath45 and @xmath171 , one would like to determine a sequence ( [ eq : sequence ] ) of real numbers so that @xmath172 is minimized .",
    "the error bound @xmath172 being small implies that the @xmath173th degree polynomial @xmath174 ( resp .",
    "the @xmath175th degree polynomial @xmath176 ) is a good polynomial approximation of @xmath177 ( resp .",
    "@xmath178 ) for @xmath179 $ ] , which implies that increasingly large values of @xmath180 will require longer sequences of coefficients ( that is , larger values of @xmath45 ) , and consequently more computational work .",
    "the situation here is in complete analogy with what happened to taylor and chebyshev polynomial approximations in the previous section .    by applying the methodology exposed in @xcite",
    "we have determined several sequences ( [ eq : sequence ] ) of length @xmath149 of ( near - to - optimal ) coefficients for @xmath45 up to @xmath181 .",
    "the procedure is described in detail in the appendix .",
    "as shown there , the task is by no means trivial , and severe technical difficulties arise when trying to extend the procedure to arbitrarily large values of @xmath180 ( and hence arbitrarily long sequences of coefficients ) .",
    "this is in contrast with taylor and chebyshev approximations .",
    "this drawback can always be circumvented by approximating the solution @xmath182 of the system of ordinary differential equations ( [ td.1b ] ) in the standard step - by - step way . in our case , approximating @xmath183 in @xmath184 steps of length @xmath185 simply consists in approximating @xmath186 by the vector @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is a @xmath165 matrix with polynomial entries ( defined in terms of the sequence ( [ eq : sequence ] ) as before ) that should approximate the rotation matrix @xmath189 for @xmath190 $ ] .",
    "clearly , the resulting procedure for approximating @xmath191 can be written as an algorithm of the form ( [ alg : splitting ] ) , corresponding to a sequence of coefficients ( with a @xmath173-periodic pattern ) of length @xmath192 .",
    "the corresponding error can be estimated as @xmath193 where @xmath194 our goal is then to minimize @xmath195 .",
    "a reasonable requirement is that @xmath196 be bounded for all @xmath184 .",
    "this only happens in general for a certain range of values of @xmath29 .",
    "one thus defines the stability threshold @xmath197 as the largest non negative real number such that @xmath196 is bounded independently of @xmath198 for all @xmath199 @xcite .",

    "in contrast , to guarantee a similar precision with chebyshev , a polynomial of degree at least @xmath232 is required , since this is the minimum value of @xmath45 such that @xmath233 , with @xmath234 given in ( [ eq : errorchebyshev ] ) .",
    "it is worth remarking the error coefficients for strang splitting method ( [ eq : abstrang ] ) with the same value of @xmath235 ( also collected in table [ tab : relevant_parameters ] ) are much larger than for methods @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "sometimes it is just more efficient to apply a combination of two different methods instead of @xmath184 steps of the same scheme .",
