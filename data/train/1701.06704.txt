    "the soft x - ray excess in agn spectra is the component below @xmath3kev that lies on top of the extrapolation of the best fitting 2 - 10kev power law @xcite .",
    "the dependence of effective temperature on mass and accretion rate in optically thick accretion disc models ( @xcite , hereafter ss73 ) is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 .",
    "we therefore expect intrinsic disc emission to contribute to the soft excess most in narrow line seyfert is ( nls1 ) , which are comparatively low mass ( @xmath6 ) , near - eddington sources . in the most luminous regions of nls1 discs the temperature is greater than the hydrogen ionization energy , so electron scattering is the dominant opacity .",
    "the color temperature is therefore greater than the effective temperature , which augments the expected contribution to the soft excess in these sources .",
    "while the soft excess is particularly prominent in nls1s , the expected disc contribution is insufficient to account for it ( @xcite , hereafter d12 ) . in broad line seyferts , which are lower eddington ratio sources , the intrinsic disc emission does not extend to high enough energies to contribute at all , and so in these sources the entire soft excess must originate elsewhere .",
    "one class of models for the soft excess invokes warm comptonization . in this picture , a warm ( @xmath7 kev )",
    "medium with moderate optical depth upscatters photons from a cool , optically thick disc .",
    "@xcite , for example , fit the soft excess of the broad line seyfert 1 ngc 5548 with @xmath8kev , @xmath9 . in this case",
    ", they pictured the medium as a transition region between the accretion disc and an inner hot geometrically thick flow .",
    "in other studies the medium is a warm layer above the inner regions of the disc .",
    "for example , @xcite fit the soft excess of the quasar pg 1211 + 143 with @xmath10kev , @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite fit two nls1s , ark 564 and mrk 1044 , with @xmath12kev , @xmath13 , and @xmath14kev , @xmath13 , respectively .",

    "@xcite fit the broad line seyfert 1 mrk 509 with @xmath18kev , @xmath19 .",
    "more recently , d12 constructed the xspec model optxagnf for the soft excess , which uses the disc spectrum at the outer coronal radius as the seed photon source and , for the purpose of energy conservation , models the warm medium as part of the disc atmosphere .",
    "d12 fit the super - eddington ( @xmath20 ) nls1 re 1034 + 396 with @xmath21kev , @xmath22 .",
    "since then , this model has been applied to several sources , such as the nls1 ii zw 177 @xcite , for which they found @xmath7kev , @xmath23 .",
    "warm comptonization models fit the spectra well , but the minimal variation of the fitted electron temperature with black hole mass and accretion rate ( e.g. @xcite ) motivated alternative models based on discrete atomic features . in reflection models ,",
    "photons from the hot ( @xmath24 kev ) corona are reflected and relativistically blurred by the inner regions of the accretion disc ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . in ionized absorption models ,",
    "high velocity winds originating from the accretion disc absorb and reemit photons from the hot corona @xcite .",
    "while these models naturally predict the minimal variation in the soft excess temperature , they typically require extreme parameters to sufficiently smear the discrete atomic features on which they are based .",
    "reflection models , for example , require near maximal spin black holes ( e.g. @xcite ) , and the original absorption models require unrealistically large wind velocities @xcite .",
    "more complex absorption models circumvent this difficulty , but they lack predictive power ( e.g. @xcite ) . other proposed explanations for the soft excess include magnetic reconnection @xcite and comptonization by shock heated electrons @xcite .",
    "because warm comptonization , reflection , and absorption all fit the spectra adequately ( e.g. @xcite ) , solving this problem requires variability and multiwavelength studies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "because optically thick disc models predict that disc emission associated with nls1s already extends into the soft x - rays , in these sources warm comptonization could be due to modifications to the vertical structure that occur in this regime .",
    "for example , warm comptonization may be due to turbulence in the disc ( @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter kb16 ) , if bulk electron velocities exceed thermal electron velocities .",
    "for the alpha disk model factor in kb16 eq .",
    "( 1 ) should be flipped . ] ( ss73 ) ,",
    "@xmath25 so we expect turbulent comptonization to be important in the extreme radiation pressure dominated regime .",
    "since the ratio of radiation to gas pressure increases with mass and accretion rate , turbulent comptonization should be most relevant for supermassive black holes accreting near - eddington , such as nls1s . in this regime , therefore , turbulent comptonization could provide a physical basis for the construction of warm comptonization models . by connecting the observed temperature and optical depth to the disc vertical structure , this could help solve the problem of the soft excess and also shed light on the properties of mhd turbulence . in broad line seyferts , which have lower eddington ratios ,",
    "the ratio of radiation to gas pressure is too small for turbulent comptonization to be significant , so if warm comptonization is present it must originate elsewhere . in these sources , it is unlikely that warm comptonization could be due to modifications to the intrinsic disc atmosphere physics , because the thermal spectrum falls off at energies significantly below the soft x - rays .",
    "kb16 outlined the fundamental physical processes underlying bulk comptonization by turbulence in accretion disc atmospheres .",
    "in this paper we model the effect of bulk comptonization on disc spectra using data from radiation mhd simulations @xcite , including both turbulent comptonization and comptonization by the background shear .",
    "we parametrize this effect by temperature and optical depth in order to make contact with observations fit by other warm comptonization models . in particular , we compare our results to the temperature and optical depth fit to re 1034 + 396 ( d12 ) , a super - eddington nls1 with an unusually large soft excess . the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec_modeling ]",
    "we describe our model in detail . in section [ sec_results ]",
    "we describe our results , and in section [ sec_discussion ] we discuss them .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in section [ sec_conclusion ] .",
    "in order to facilitate comparisons with warm thermal comptonization models of the soft x - ray excess , we seek to characterize the contribution of bulk comptonization with a temperature and an optical depth .",
    "to do this , we use data from radiation mhd shearing box simulations to compute spectra both including and excluding bulk velocities .",
    "since our simulation data is limited , we use a scheme to scale data from a simulation run with a particular radius , mass , and accretion rate to different sets of these parameters .",
    "we describe this scheme in section [ sec_scalings ] . in this work",
    "we use data from simulation 110304a , which is similar to simulations 1112a and 1226b @xcite , but has a lower surface density , @xmath26 g @xmath27 , which results in a higher radiation to gas pressure ratio .",
    "the parameters of interest for 110304a are given in table [ table_sim_param ] .",
    "we calculate the spectrum at a given timestep using monte carlo post processing simulations . for this work , we chose the @xmath28 orbit timestep at random .",
    "the details of our monte carlo implementation of bulk compton scattering are in appendix [ sec_mcdetails ] . to isolate the effect of the turbulence alone , we also calculate spectra without the background shear . to model an entire accretion disc we calculate spectra at multiple radii .",
    "we discuss our choice of radii in section [ sec_radii ] .",
    "the flux obtained at a particular radius corresponds to an eddington ratio .",
    "if our scaling scheme were perfect , the corresponding eddington ratios at the other radii would be the same by construction .",
    "we correct for minor discrepancies by normalizing the other spectra so that their corresponding eddington ratios are the same .",
    "we transport the spectra computed with bulk velocities at multiple radii to infinity and superpose the results to obtain the final , observed spectrum .",
    "we choose a viewing angle of @xmath29 . at this angle",
    "the gravitational redshift approximately cancels the doppler blueshift ( d12 , @xcite ) , which allows us to use a newtonian transport code .",
    "we chose this method because it is easy to include the propagation of error bars , but we verified that our results are unchanged when a fully relativistic kerr spacetime transport code @xcite is used instead .",
    "the spectra computed without bulk velocities are used as seed photon sources for a warm comptonizing medium characterized solely by a uniform temperature and optical depth .",
    "we implement this by solving the kompaneets equation at each radius .",
    "we then transport the resultant spectra to infinity to obtain the observed spectrum .",
    "we fit the observed spectrum comptonized by the warm medium to the observed spectrum computed with bulk velocities by adjusting the temperature and optical depth .",
    "we explore the effect of varying the outer radius , @xmath30 , of the warm comptonizing medium on the goodness of fit parameter , @xmath31 , and select the radius for which this parameter is minimized .    to provide insight into the physics of bulk comptonization , we also perform spectral calculations in which the simulation data are truncated at the effective photosphere and the emissivity is zero everywhere except in the cells at the base . since we expect bulk comptonization to be dominated by the contribution from photons emitted at the effective photosphere , we expect the resulting temperature and optical depth to be nearly unchanged .",
    "we discuss this point more in section [ sec_discussion_2 ] .      in this section",
    "we derive a scheme to scale data from a radiation mhd simulation run with a particular radius , mass , and accretion rate to a different set of these parameters .",
    "we first observe that the construction of an appropriate scheme is made possible by the fact that the density , temperature , and velocity profiles show considerable self - similarity across a wide range of simulation parameters .",
    "for example , in figures [ fig_density_140 ] and [ fig_velocity_140 ] we compare the density and bulk velocity profiles from the 140 orbit timestep of 110304a , which is the basis of this work , with those from a snapshot of opalr20 @xcite , a simulation run in an entirely different regime ( table [ table_sim_param ] ) .",
    "the bulk temperature is defined by @xmath32 .",
    "subscript `` @xmath33 '' denotes midplane values .",
    "the variable @xmath34 is the distance from the midplane and the scale height @xmath35 is the value of @xmath34 for which @xmath36 . the profiles nearly coincide , and even the discrepancy between the density profiles at large @xmath37 is likely just due to a temporary fluctuation at 140 orbits . at 180 orbits , for example , there is no discrepancy ( figure [ fig_density_180 ] ) .",
    "this self - similarity is perhaps an even more robust phenomenon than the difference in simulation parameters alone would indicate since the inclusion of the iron opacity bump in opalr20 is a non - trivial effect . in particular , the thermal stability of opalr20",
    "depends on the inclusion of this effect @xcite , whereas it is now believed that the thermal stability in 110304a is a result of the narrow box size in the radial direction and is therefore artificial @xcite . despite this caveat as well as the fact that the mass parameter for opalr20 is closer to our regime of interest",
    ", we chose 110304a for this work because the photospheres are better resolved , a decisive advantage for the purpose of computing spectra .    .shearing box simulation parameters [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < \" , ]     [ table_obs ]      in nls1s the wien tail of the intrinsic disc spectrum contributes to the soft excess ( d12 ) .",
    "bulk comptonization increases the contribution to the soft excess by shifting the wien tail to higher energy .",
    "since bulk comptonization increases with accretion rate , we expect this contribution to be greatest in near and super - eddington sources . in broad line seyferts ,",
    "the ratio of radiation to gas pressure is too low for bulk comptonization to be significant .",
    "we compare our results to the analysis by d12 of re1034 + 396 , a super - eddington nls1 with an unusually large soft excess .",
    "this analysis is summarized in table [ table_obs ] .",
    "the comparison is appropriate because the mass and eddington ratio we chose for our spectral calculations correspond to those fit to re1034 + 396 , though we do note that our model for comptonization is more detailed than the one in d12 . and",
    "only the overall normalization varies with radius .",
    "this choice was made to minimize computation time .",
    "] we see that the compton @xmath2 parameter , @xmath38 , which characterizes the overall impact of comptonization on the spectrum , is remarkably similar to the values we found .",
    "the fitted temperature and optical depth are also similar to our values .",
    "it may be , therefore , that the soft excess is unusually large in this system because of the contribution of bulk comptonization .",
    "a soft excess is also present in less luminous agn for which bulk comptonization is unlikely to be significant , and in general it seems that no single physical effect can fully explain the soft excess in all agn .",
    "until the contribution to the soft excess by other proposed mechanisms such as reflection and absorption are better understood , it will be difficult to tease out the contribution of bulk comptonization .",
    "but our calculations show that if this can be done then observations of the soft excess can be used to constrain properties of the turbulence as well as other disc parameters .",
    "comptonization of photons by bulk motions is due to effects both first and second order in velocity ( kb16 ) .",
    "the kompaneets equation , which describes thermal comptonization , can not be used to describe first order effects , but kb16 showed that for incompressible motions in a periodic box with an escape probability , it does capture second order effects .",
    "the kompaneets temperature for bulk velocities , which is a function of the photon mean free path , is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the radiation energy density and @xmath41 is the radiation pressure tensor .",
    "note that only the traceless part of the pressure tensor , which is the shear stress , contributes since this result assumes incompressible motions .",
    "we see that the kompaneets temperature for bulk velocities is proportional to the stress multiplied by the strain rate , which is just the viscous dissipation of bulk motions by the photons .",
    "a stratified disc atmosphere is more complex than a periodic box , but the kompaneets equation may still adequately describe second order effects .    for our spectral calculations bulk comptonization",
    "is well described by the kompaneets equation , which suggests that second order effects , not first order effects , are dominant .",
    "this may be because mri turbulence is incompressible and first order effects vanish for incompressible , but not compressible , turbulence ( kb16 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the photosphere regions are magnetically dominated and show considerable compressible motions because of the parker instability @xcite , so it seems more likely that first order effects average out .    assuming second order effects are dominant",
    ", we can gain physical insight into the fitted temperatures and optical depths by considering the dependence of the shear stress , @xmath41 , on the photon mean free path .",
    "the stress is largest when the photon mean free path is long relative to the maximum turbulence wavelength , and is proportional to the square of the photon mean free path when it is small ( kb16 ) .",
    "therefore , comptonization is only significant in the region near enough to the photosphere that the photon mean free path is comparable to the maximum turbulence wavelength",
    ". the resulting comptonization temperature and optical depth should be the same for all photons emitted below this region . inside this region , on the other hand , photons emitted nearer the photosphere should have comparatively larger comptonization temperatures and smaller optical depths . for real disc atmospheres , which are stratified in ( gas ) temperature , photons contributing to the spectral peak",
    "are predominantly emitted at the effective photosphere , which for modest turbulence should be below the region where bulk comptonization is significant .",
    "we therefore expect the resulting comptonization temperature and optical depth to be unchanged when we truncate the atmosphere at the effective photosphere and set the emissivity equal to zero everywhere except at the base .",
    "our findings confirm this .",
    "this is also useful because these spectral calculations run much faster which allows for a more efficient exploration of the disc parameter space .",
    "we see that when bulk velocities are included in spectral calculations , the observed spectrum is shifted to higher energy . in particular , the wien tail is shifted right . while this allows us to characterize bulk comptonization with a temperature and optical depth as a function of accretion disc parameters , to determine the actual impact on disc spectra we must consider whether our spectral calculations are consistent with the underlying shearing box simulations on which they are based .",
    "in section [ sec_discussion_2 ] we showed that bulk comptonization here is predominantly an effect that is second order in velocity , but the underlying shearing box simulations @xcite do not include this effect because the flux limited diffusion approximation is used ( kb16 ) .",
    "therefore , according to this picture we expect the spectral calculations without the bulk velocities to be consistent with the flux found in the underlying shearing box simulation . in order to determine the effect of including the bulk velocities on the resulting spectra we must take into account the back reaction on the vertical structure . since adding in bulk comptonization without modifying the vertical structure increases the flux and violates energy conservation , including this effect in the underlying shearing box simulation would lower the gas temperature until energy conservation is restored .",
    "therefore , for significant comptonization , while the wien tail shifts to the right , the spectral peak shifts to the left . the overall effect ,",
    "therefore , is to broaden the spectrum . in practice ,",
    "if the comptonization temperature is only slightly higher than the gas temperature then the spectrum will still be broadened but without an obvious leftward shift of the spectral peak .    because the decrease in gas temperature as well as other changes in the vertical structure may then affect bulk comptonization , in theory the two",
    "should be calculated self - consistently .",
    "another complicating factor is vertical advection of radiation , a velocity dependent effect that increases the number of photons emitted without affecting their energies , which also impacts energy conservation .",
    "but as long as bulk comptonization is a perturbative effect , our fundamental results should hold : bulk comptonization broadens the spectrum by lowering the gas temperature and shifting the wien tail to higher energy such that the total energy is conserved , and the characteristic temperatures and optical depths are given by table [ table_results_1 ] .",
    "furthermore , our method can be used to explore how bulk comptonization scales with different parameters such as the mass , accretion rate , spin , turbulent stress scaling , and boundary condition at the innermost stable circular orbit .",
    "our results suggest that comptonization by bulk motions is predominantly due to turbulence , not shear .",
    "but since comptonization by shear is not negligible , here we consider how it differs from comptonization by turbulence , both in its potential effect on spectra and on the disc vertical structure .",
    "from the perspective of total energy conservation , bulk comptonization by the background shear at a given radius should have the same impact on the spectrum as turbulent comptonization .",
    "it should shift the wien tail to the right and decrease the gas temperature , broadening the spectrum .",
    "this is because the effective temperature for a steady state disc at a given radius is strictly fixed by the mass , mass accretion rate , and radius .",
    "but comptonization by the background shear plays a completely different role in the disc equations than comptonization by turbulence . for the latter ,",
    "the stress on the mean fluid flow is still entirely determined by mri turbulence . for the @xmath42 prescription , for example",
    ", the value of @xmath42 is still set by the saturation level of the magnetic field and is therefore presumably unchanged .",
    "but comptonization by shear is an additional stress on the mean fluid flow , and would therefore presumably increase @xmath42 .",
    "since comptonization by shear , at least in the regimes we have explored here , has only a perturbative effect on the spectrum , we expect any increase in @xmath42 to be small .",
    "this is physically intuitive since dissipation by shear can be significant only near the photosphere where the mean free path is larger ( see section [ sec_discussion_2 ] ) , whereas dissipation by mri turbulence is significant throughout the body of the disc .",
    "an interesting consequence of the difference between comptonization by turbulence and background shear is that they have different effects on the total flux emitted from a shearing box . in a shearing box",
    "the density , not the radius , is fixed , and the flux depends on @xmath42 ( eq . [ eq_flux_scale ] ) .",
    "for comptonization by turbulence , unless the mri is affected , @xmath42 is unchanged , and the gas temperature must decrease so that the flux is unchanged .",
    "but for comptonization by the background shear , an additional source of stress on the mean flow is present , which modifies @xmath42 and allows the flux to change . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq_flux_scale ] ) we would ironically expect the flux to decrease rather than increase , but we should not take this prediction seriously .",
    "comptonization by bulk motions is only significant near the photosphere where predominantly magnetic pressure , not radiation pressure , supports the atmosphere , so a small perturbation to @xmath42 confined to this region can not be treated self - consistently by the standard @xmath42 disc equations .",
    "of course , in practice it is not well understood what determines @xmath42 ; it is possible that even comptonization by turbulence indirectly affects @xmath42 .",
    "it is also possible that comptonization by the background shear indirectly decreases the saturation level of the magnetic field so that the net effect is to leave @xmath42 unchanged .",
    "our point is that comptonization by turbulence and comptonization by the background shear play different roles in the disc equations and therefore potentially have different effects on the vertical structure .",
    "we modeled the contribution of bulk comptonization to the soft x - ray excess in agn . to do this , we calculated disc spectra both taking into account and not taking into account bulk velocities with data from radiation mhd simulations .",
    "because our simulation data was limited , we developed a scheme to scale the disc vertical structure to different values of radius , mass , and accretion rate .",
    "for each parameter set , we characterized our results by a temperature and optical depth in order to facilitate comparisons with other warm comptonization models of the soft excess .",
    "we chose our fiducial mass , @xmath43 , and accretion rate , @xmath1 , to correspond to the values fit by d12 to the super - eddington narrow - line seyfert 1 re1034 + 396 , which has an unusually large soft excess .",
    "our principle results are as follows .    for zero spin , when comptonization by both turbulence and the background shear are included ,",
    "the compton @xmath2 parameter we find , @xmath44 , is close to that found by d12 for re1034 + 396 , @xmath38 .",
    "the temperature we find is a bit lower ( @xmath45kev vs. @xmath46kev ) , but the optical depth is higher ( @xmath47 vs. @xmath22 ) . for spin",
    "@xmath48 , the correspondence is remarkable ; we find @xmath38 , @xmath49kev , and @xmath17 .",
    "we find that bulk comptonization is primarily due to turbulence , not the background shear ( fig . [ fig_fit_b ] ) .",
    "both the fitted temperature and optical depth increase moderately when we double the turbulent stress scaling to @xmath50 .",
    "when we increase the mass , the fitted temperature decreases , but the @xmath2 parameter increases .",
    "this indicates that bulk comptonization is more significant , which we expect since the ratio of electron thermal to bulk velocities depends on the ratio of radiation to gas pressure ( eq . [ eq_ratio_1 ] ) , which in turn scales with mass ( ss73 ) .",
    "our results are given in table [ table_results_1 ] .",
    "to enforce energy conservation , the impact of bulk comptonization on disc spectra is to shift the wien tail to the right while simultaneously lowering the gas temperature , broadening the spectrum .",
    "since we find that bulk comptonization is well described by the kompaneets equation , this suggests that it is predominantly an effect second order in velocity ( kb16 ) .",
    "knowledge of this is important for self - consistently resolving bulk comptonization in radiation mhd simulations , since common closure schemes such as flux limited diffusion do not include this effect ( kb16 ) .",
    "the soft excess in general is unlikely due to a single physical mechanism .",
    "other contributing effects , such as reflection and absorption , must be better understood to make precise comparisons of predictions by models of bulk comptonization with observations .",
    "but the fact that our results , based simply on the most naive scalings , are in agreement with observations suggests that at least in the super - eddington nls1 regime bulk comptonization may play a significant role in producing the soft x - ray excess .",
    "if so , observations of the soft excess can be directly tied to the properties of mhd turbulence as well as fundamental disc parameters .",

    "photon packets are sampled from an emission function defined in the fluid frame , @xmath51 , such as thermal brehmsstrahlung .",
    "the variables @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the fluid frame photon energy and angle , respectively .",
    "since the density grid is defined in the lab frame , we transform the density at a given point to the fluid frame before evaluating @xmath51 . in this frame , the number of photons with energies between @xmath52 and @xmath54 within a solid angle @xmath55 per unit time per unit volume is @xmath56 d \\epsilon_0 d { \\bf \\omega_0}$ ] . the photon packet is then assigned a fluid frame statistical weight proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "lab frame energies and directions are calculated with standard lorentz transforms , but calculating the correct lab frame statistical weight is more subtle .",
    "since we want to sample from the lab frame photon number emissivity ( i.e. , per unit time , per unit volume ) distribution @xmath58 , @xmath59 it may seem that the fluid frame statistical weight should be multiplied by @xmath60 , but this is in fact incorrect . to see why , note that even without changing the statistical weight , simply boosting the energy and direction already results in a new distribution , @xmath61 which differs from the original distribution by the change of measure factor .",
    "since the evaluation of this factor yields @xmath62 it so happens that the new distribution is already the lab frame photon number emissivity : @xmath63 therefore , the fluid frame and lab frame statistical weights are equal . once a photon packet s lab frame energy , direction , and statistical weight are assigned , the method used to evolve it is in essence the same as in @xcite .",
    "fluid frame parameters are self - consistently used in scattering events , and lab frame parameters are used to calculate changes in photon position between events .",
