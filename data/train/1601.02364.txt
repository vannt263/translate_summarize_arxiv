    "a nonperturbative self - consistent approach to the electron self - energy @xmath0 was provided in 1965 by hedin  @xcite in a closed set of equations , relating @xmath0 with the one - electron green s function @xmath4 , the dynamic screened interaction @xmath5 , the polarization function @xmath6 , and the vertex function @xmath1 .",
    "this is a formally exact formulation , but it is difficult to implement this scheme as it is , because we can not determine the electron - hole irreducible interaction @xmath7 , a central quantity in the bethe - salpeter equation to calculate @xmath1 , through its original definition using a functional derivative , @xmath8 .",
    "thus we are forced to adopt some approximate treatments such as the gw approximation in which @xmath1 is taken as unity .    for more than two decades",
    ", successful calculations have been done for molecules , clusters , semiconductors , and insulators in the one - shot gw ( or g@xmath2w@xmath2 ) approximation  @xcite , but this is usually regarded as a too primitive approximation , mostly because it is , in general , not a conserving approximation in the sense of baym and kadanoff  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the fully self - consistent gw approximation obeys the conservation laws related to the macroscopic quantities like the total electron number . in recent years , this self - consistent calculation has become feasible , but we are led to a puzzling conclusion that the experiment on quasiparticle properties in semiconductors and insulators is much better described in the g@xmath2w@xmath2 approximation than in the gw one  @xcite . in atoms and molecules ,",
    "the situation is less clear , but in many cases the g@xmath2w@xmath2 approximation gives better results  @xcite .    in metals , on the other hand ,",

    "some schemes have already been proposed for this purpose  @xcite , but they do not satisfy the ward identity ( wi ) , an exact relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 due to gauge invariance representing the local electron - number conservation  @xcite . in 2001 , based on general consideration on algorithms beyond the baym - kadanoff one  @xcite , a scheme was proposed to incorporate @xmath1 in the gw approximation with automatically fulfilling the wi  @xcite . this gw@xmath1 scheme with the use of the information on the local - field factor in the electron gas  @xcite for determining @xmath9 ( see , fig .

    "this scheme is numerically confirmed to provide nonnegative one - electron spectral functions @xmath13 for the homogeneous electron gas at least for @xmath14 without any special treatments to impose on the positivity of @xmath13 , contrary to a recently proposed scheme  @xcite .    in the former part of this paper , we study the quasiparticle properties in the normal state to find that the quasiparticle dispersion self - consistently obtained in the g@xmath10 scheme for semiconductors and insulators is essentially the same as that in the g@xmath2w@xmath2 approximation , implying that g@xmath2w@xmath2 is superior to gw in the sense that for the systems with gapful excitations , it actually takes proper account of the mutual cancellation between vertex and high - order self - energy corrections .",
    "this observation resolves the above - mentioned long - standing puzzle on gw versus g@xmath2w@xmath2 .",
    "here we emphasize that this cancellation is considered up to infinite order as a whole with specifying the assumptions needed in the cancellation , in sharp contrast with the claims of a similar kind in the past  @xcite ; they were inferred from the behavior of low - order terms in perturbation expansion for metals .     and ( b ) in its improved version or the g@xmath10 , respectively . ]    in the latter part of this paper , we study a similar problem in the superconducting state by the calculation of its transition temperature @xmath3 in the phonon mechanism in both the conventional eliashberg theory  @xcite and the gauge - invariant self - consistent ( gisc ) method  @xcite which correspond , respectively , to the gw and gw@xmath1 schemes for calculating the normal - state properties .",
    "even for the case of weakly correlated and weakly coupled superconductors such as al , we find that the calculated @xmath3 in gisc is different from that in the eliashberg theory but close to that in the g@xmath2w@xmath2 approximation .",
    "we discuss the implication of this result from various aspects , including the importance of determining the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath15  @xcite from first principles and a proposal of the suitable functional form for the pairing interaction kernel in the density functional theory for superconductors ( scdft )  @xcite .",
    "for systems with translation symmetry in which momentum @xmath16 is a good quantum number , the exact hedin s relations can be explicitly written in the following way : the dyson equation relates @xmath17 with @xmath18 through @xmath19 with @xmath20 a combined notation of @xmath16 , spin @xmath21 , and fermion matsubara frequency @xmath22 at temperature @xmath23 with an integer @xmath20  @xcite . the bare green s function @xmath24 is written as @xmath25 with @xmath26 the bare one - electron dispersion .",

    "thus the effect of @xmath9 is weak in semiconductors and insulators .",
    "( iii ) the inherent problem in the g@xmath2w@xmath2 approximation is the dependence of the results on the arbitrary starting basis . from our perspective , the dependence originates from the degree of satisfying the above two assumptions .",
    "thus , if the gap energies ( or the vertical ionization potentials ( ips ) for atoms and molecules ) are large enough , the dependence becomes small and the results in the g@xmath2w@xmath2 approximation from any starting point are close to the experimental values , as seen for ips of he and ne in table v in ref .",

    "<S> on the basis of the self - consistent calculation scheme for the electron self - energy @xmath0 with the use of the three - point vertex function @xmath1 always satisfying the ward identity , we find that the obtained quasiparticle dispersion in the normal state in gapped systems such as semiconductors , insulators , and molecules is well reproduced by that in the one - shot gw ( or g@xmath2w@xmath2 ) approximation . in calculating the superconducting transition temperature @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , we also find a similar situation ; the result for @xmath3 in the gauge - invariant self - consistent ( gisc ) framework including the effect of @xmath1 satisfying the ward identity is different from that in the conventional eliashberg theory ( which amounts to the gw approximation for superconductivity ) but is close to that in the g@xmath2w@xmath2 approximation . </S>",
    "<S> those facts indicate that the g@xmath2w@xmath2 approximation actually takes proper account of both vertex and high - order self - energy corrections in a mutually cancelling manner and thus we can understand that the g@xmath2w@xmath2 approximation is better than the fully self - consistent gw one in obtaining some of physical quantities . </S>"
