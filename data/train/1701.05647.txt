    "in the literature , there were a large amount of studies about parametric linear and nonlinear panel data models , and arellano ( 2003 ) , baltigi ( 2005 ) , and hsiao ( 2003 ) had provided excellent overview of parametric panel data model analysis . to relax the strong restrictions assumed in the parametric panel data models ,",
    "nonparametric and semiparametric panel data models have received a lot of attention in recent years .",
    "compared to traditional parametric panel data model , nonparametric or semiparametric panel data models are better and more flexible to fit the actual data .",
    "thus , this kind of models have become the hot research topic for the econometricians and statisticians .",
    "for example , henderson , carroll and li ( 2008 ) , and li , peng and tong ( 2013 ) considered the fixed effects nonparametric panel data model .",
    "henderson and ullah ( 2005 ) , lin and ying ( 2001 ) , and wu and zhang ( 2002 ) considered the random effects nonparametric panel data models .",
    "li and stengos ( 1996 ) considered a partially linear panel data model with some regressors being endogenous via iv approach .",
    "su and ullah ( 2006 ) investigated the fixed effects partially linear panel data model with exogenous regressors .",
    "zhang et al . ( 2011 ) considered the empirical likelihood inference for the fixed effects partially linear panel data model .",
    "sun , carroll and li ( 2009 ) considered the problem of estimating a varying coefficient panel data model with fixed effects using a local linear regression approach .",
    "chen , gao and li ( 2013a , 2013b ) and lai , li and lian ( 2013 ) studied the semiparametric estimation for a single - index panel data model , and among others .",
    "recently , the fixed effects models are frequently used in econometrics and biometrics . in this paper , we consider the following partially linear panel data models with fixed effects :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 are @xmath2 vector of observable regressors , @xmath3 are explanatory variables in [ 0,1 ] , @xmath4 is a @xmath2 vector of unknown coefficients , @xmath5 is an unknown smooth function in [ 0,1 ] , @xmath6 are random errors with zero mean , and @xmath7 are fixed effects . in addition , @xmath8 is the time series length , @xmath9 is the cross section size .    for model ( [ 1 - 2 ] ) ,",
    "we assume that @xmath7 are unobserved time - invariant individual effects . model ( [ 1 - 2 ] ) is called as a partially linear fixed effects model if @xmath7 are correlated with @xmath10 with an unknown correlation structure . for identification purpose ,",
    "we impose @xmath11 .",
    "an application of fixed effects models is the study of individual wage rate , @xmath12 represents different unobserved abilities of individual @xmath13 , such as the unmeasured skills or unobservable characteristics of individual @xmath13 , which maybe correlate with some observed covariates : age , educational level , job grade , gender , work experience and _ et al._. as a special case , when @xmath7 are uncorrelated with @xmath10 , model ( [ 1 - 2 ] ) becomes a partially linear random effects model .",
    "baltagi and li ( 2002 ) applied the first - order difference to eliminate the fixed effects and used the series method to estimate the parametric and nonparametric components , and they further established the asymptotic properties .",
    "su and ullah ( 2006 ) considered the estimation of partially linear panel data models with fixed effects .",
    "zhang et al . ( 2011 ) applied the empirical likelihood method to model ( [ 1 - 2 ] ) .    for the partially linear panel data models , the existing literatures considered the pointwise asymptotic normality of the estimator for the nonparametric component , and the result can be used to construct the pointwise confidence bands . in practice , we need to construct the simultaneous confidence band of the nonparametric function in the model .",
    "the simultaneous confidence band is a powerful tool to check the graphical representation of the nonparametric function during the practical applications .",
    "therefore , there are extensive literatures on the construction of the simultaneous confidence band . for example , fan and zhang ( 2000 ) , and zhang and peng ( 2010 ) considered the simultaneous confidence bands for the coefficient functions in varying - coefficient models ; li , peng and tong ( 2013 ) considered the simultaneous confidence band for nonparametric fixed effects panel data model ; li et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and yang et al .",

    ", combining the idea of least - squares dummy - variable approach in parametric panel data models with the local linear regression technique in nonparametric models , we use the profile least - squares dummy - variable method proposed in su and ullah ( 2006 ) to remove the fixed effects , and further obtain the estimators of parametric and nonparametric components , which do not depend on the fixed effects . under some suitable conditions",
    ", we establish the asymptotic distribution of their maximum absolute deviation between the estimated nonparametric component and the true nonparametric component , and hence the result can be used to construct the simultaneous confidence band of the nonparametric component . in order to construct the simultaneous confidence band based on the asymptotic distribution",
    ", we first need to estimate the asymptotic bias and conditional variance , and choose the bandwidth for estimating the second derivative of nonparametric function .",
    "these will cause computational burden and accumulative errors , and it becomes difficult for the construction of the simultaneous confidence band . to overcome these problems , we further propose a bootstrap method to construct the simultaneous confidence band of the nonparametric component in model ( [ 1 - 2 ] ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
