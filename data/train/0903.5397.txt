    "a drawback of the approach is an increased complexity in the understanding of the droplet dynamics , making it more difficult to find robust implementations of given tasks  @xcite .",

    "the model was proposed as a simple tool for finding robust dynamical behavior and to quantify its response to changes in the driving parameters and the geometrical parameters of the network .",
    "while applying the model calculations to existing devices , it turned out that the most important parameter for robust behavior is the _ effective hydrodynamic resistance of droplets_. compared to its important role in the overall dynamics of droplets in a network , this property has not attracted sufficient interest , at least for droplets of a viscous fluid . as a first guess , it was therefore assumed to be a constant in the model .    in this paper , we present results from three methods for measuring the hydrodynamic resistance of droplets being transported in microchannels : a standard method that employs a pressure sensor as a reference , and two new self - regulated low - cost methods which do not require laborious external equipment .",

    "this means for the loop device @xmath33 with  @xmath34 the total flowrate in the input / output channels , and with  @xmath35 and  @xmath36 the flowrates in the short and long branches of the loop . here and in the following , the indices @xmath37  and @xmath38 stand for the short and the long channel , respectively .",

    "all droplets in a channel  @xmath11 have the same velocity velocities  @xmath41 .",
    "its value is proportional to the total flowrate  @xmath42 in the channel ( oil + water / glycerol ) , with a constant factor of proportionality , @xmath43 here , @xmath44  is the cross - section which does not change .",
    "@xmath45  was found to be approximately @xmath46 in our experiments .",
    "each droplet adds the same amount  @xmath6 to the total resistance  @xmath40 of a channel  @xmath11 , such that @xmath47 with @xmath48  the number of droplets in the channel , and with  @xmath10 its resistance in the absence of droplets .",
    "the resistance  @xmath6 of droplets should be a constant .",

    "the data were acquired in a straight channel .",
    "the parameters are  @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 . ]",
    "some comments on the assumptions and their expected validity are in order at this point : the linearity of velocity and total flowrate  ( a ) has been observed under experimental conditions , both in fig .",
    "[ vel_vs_qtot ] and in ref .",
    "assumption  ( b ) will prove false if there is cooperative behavior between the droplets .",
    "such effects will not occur as long as the droplets are sufficiently distant .",
    "we will quantify the necessary distance in the experimental section .",
    "assumption  ( b ) will also fail if the droplets have different sizes or if they are smaller than the channel and are thus not forced to be centered .",
    "assumption  ( c ) is nothing else than the linearity of eq .  .",
    "in fact , we will present deviations which are important for small velocities , but not for larger ones . also in case of long plug - like droplets , a nonlinearity in eq .  , and",
    "therefore a velocity - dependence of  @xmath6 must be expected .",
    "such effects have been reported for bubbles  @xcite . by construction of our device , that is by virtue of its simple geometry , we do not require assumption  ( c ) for the method to be valid .",
    "finally , assumption  ( d ) will not be questioned here .",
    "the precise criterion , whether it is the highest flowrate , the highest pressure drop , or the largest velocity which counts , does not seem to be important in our case as we use locally symmetric junctions and the same channel cross - sections everywhere .",
    "the first variant of the proposed device comprises a small loop , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : small_loop ] .",
    "the two branches of the loop are approximately ten  times longer than they are wide .",
    "the idea of the method is to send in a periodic sequence of droplets and to vary slowly their initial distance .",
    "if one starts with quite a large distance , the droplets will all take the short route and leave the loop before the next one arrives , see fig .",
    "[ fig : small_loop]a . for a continuously reduced initial distance  @xmath53 ,",
    "one finds a sudden change in the droplet behavior at a specific distance  @xmath54 .",
    "the droplets start to influence each other : the following droplet will take the long route because the previous one still enhances the resistance of the short branch .",
    "this situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : small_loop]b . of course",
    ", in order to make the method work , the ( yet unknown ) hydrodynamic resistance of a single droplet must be larger than the difference in resistances of the channels when no droplets populate them .",
    "the applicability can therefore be adjusted by choosing the length ratio @xmath55 .",
    "the hydrodynamic resistance of the droplet is determined from the value of the initial distance  @xmath54 , at which the droplets stop taking the entire short branch , by applying the simple eq .   below , which we will derive now .",
    "the initial distance  @xmath54 is obtained as the distance which an approaching droplet can travel while the previous one traverses the short branch .",
    "the time  @xmath56 which a droplet stays in the short branch is expressed as follows , when assumption  ( a ) is used , @xmath57 where  @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath35  are the length , the velocity and the flow rate in the short arm . in the same time span , another droplet in the incoming channel covers the length @xmath60 which leads to the elimination of the parameters @xmath45  and  @xmath44 , and which leaves us with @xmath61 now , we make use of assumption  ( b ) , together with eq .  .",
    "as the pressure difference is the same in both branches of the loop , we obtain for the ratio of their flowrates @xmath62 here , it proves convenient to express the hydrodynamic resistances in terms of lengths , as defined in eq .  .",
    "combining the last two equations , we find the result already given in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath63 which can easily be resolved for  @xmath18 .",
    "note that we did not make use of assumption  ( c ) in this short derivation .",
    "equation   therefore holds for any non - linear relationship between  @xmath35 and the resistance  @xmath64 of the droplet .",
    "it is the simple geometry of the device which allows to circumvent the simplifying assumption  ( c ) , which is not possible in extended networks .",
    "note also the nice property of this formula that the hydrodynamic resistance length of the droplet is only given by geometrical properties , namely the two lengths of the branches , and by the experimentally determined initial distance  @xmath54 between droplets .",
    "this means that once the device has been elaborated , the measure of the droplet resistance is simply obtained from observing the droplets taking different routes through the loop .",
    "note also that the determination of the droplet resistance from this device relies strongly on the assumption  ( a ) , and only weakly on the assumption  ( d ) .",
    "assumption  ( c ) is not used at all , and assumption  ( b ) is unimportant , since we treat one droplet per channel ( @xmath65 ) which is the trivial case for  ( b ) .    the limitation of the here described small - loop method is that the two branches are quite short .",
    "a violation of the above derivation might occur , in that the resistance  @xmath6 depends on the instantaneous distances between droplet and the two junctions , both of which perturb the flow in a non - trivial manner , leading to an effective hydrodynamic interaction between them .",
    "in this aspect , the smaller the channel cross - section is , the better the small - loop device works .",
    "this will lead to a more uniform flow and at the same time increase the resistance of droplets .",
    "we propose a second variant of the loop device which allows to determine the hydrodynamic resistance of droplets with a different weighting of the assumptions .",
    "this time , the loop is much larger compared to the previous geometry , see fig .",
    "[ fig : large_loop ] . like for the small loop device",
    ", a regular train of droplets is injected into the main channel .",
    "this time , there can be several to many droplets in each branch of the loop , and their resistance is determined by counting the droplets in each branch at every time a new droplet has made its decision .",
    "thus , the droplet dynamics depends on the model assumptions in a different way : according to assumption  ( d ) each droplet entering the loop systematically goes into the branch of lower hydrodynamic resistance . and , since each droplet adds a certain resistance to the channel ( assumption  b ) , it tends to equilibrate the hydrodynamic resistances of the two branches of the loop .",
    "the same principle has been previously used in the analysis of the hydrodynamic resistance of bubbles  @xcite , however only in the case of a symmetric loop and without the complementary device with a small loop .    during the run of the experiment ,",
    "the total hydrodynamic resistances of the two branches change as functions of the numbers of droplets they already contain .",
    "we thus have to track the relation between these two resistances , @xmath66 where both comparison operators are found . each time a droplet has chosen a route , we gain some information about which branch of the loop has had the smaller total resistance .",
    "in fact , each time a droplet chooses the longer branch , we obtain a lower bound for  @xmath6 ; the short branch provides an upper bound . when resolving eq .   for  @xmath6 , rewritten in terms of the corresponding length  @xmath18",
    ", we obtain these bounds as @xmath67_{\\to\\textit{long } }    <",

    "observing many droplets will successively narrow the bounds on  @xmath18 , leaving finally an interval which depends on both the initial droplet spacing  @xmath53 and on the length ratio  @xmath55 . a large loop which is nearly symmetric leads to a good accuracy of the method .",
    "figure  [ fig : large_loop ] shows two examples of how eq .   is applied , leading in fig .",
    "[ fig : large_loop]a to a lower bound , and in fig .",
    "[ fig : large_loop]b to an upper bound .    in terms of the assumptions required for the analysis , this large - loop method appears to be complementary to the small - loop variant .",
    "we here make heavy use of assumption  ( b ) in that we assume the droplets to add up their individual resistances . on the contrary ,",
    "the small - loop proposition was mainly based on assumption  ( a ) which is not really required here , because the time the droplets stay in in both branches of the loop are not used . also",
    "the role of the droplet velocity is different .",
    "while the flowrates in the two branches of the small - loop device can be very different , they are automatically balanced here  at least their average values , with fluctuations due to the fluctuating numbers of droplets .",
    "we made the microfluidic devices out of poly(dimethyl - siloxane ) ( pdms ) using standard photo - lithographic and soft - lithographic techniques  @xcite . a transparency mask of @xmath69 resolution ( cad / art services  inc .",
    ", california ) was used in 1:1  contact photolithography with su-8  photoresist ( microchem , newton , ma ) to generate a negative `` master '' consisting of patterned su-8 photoresist on a silicon wafer with a flat surface .",
    "positive replicas were formed by molding a 5:1 mixture of  pdms with a temperature - active cross - linker against the master . after curing the pdms layer for 20  minutes at @xmath70 , it was peeled off the silicon wafer , and inlet and outlet holes were punched .",
    "a glass slide , serving as the rigid substrate of the device , was covered by a thin layer of a 20:1 mixture of pdms / cross - linker and cured during 40  minutes at @xmath70 .",
    "the pdms surfaces were then activated with an uvo - cleaner ( jelight 144ax )  @xcite for @xmath71 , and both pdms surfaces were immediately brought together .",
    "an irreversible seal was formed between the pdms surface and the glass substrate .",
    "the resulting rectangular microchannels are @xmath0 high and @xmath26 wide .",
    "droplets were fabricated from a droplet generator with a cross - junction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schema ] ) : inlets for different liquids , one of oil ( viscosity @xmath72 ) and one for a glycerol / water mixture , lead into a channel located downstream the junction .",
    "a colorant  ( bromothymol blue ) was added to this aqueous phase in order to increase the contrast of the droplet .",
    "external connections to syringes ( hamilton , @xmath73@xmath74 ) were made using polyethylene ( pe20 ) medical tubing ( outer diameter : @xmath75 ) .",
    "the syringes were contracted by three programmable syringe pumps ( cetoni , nemesys ) controlled by a computer .",
    "an additional oil inlet further downstream served to vary the spatial period between droplets without modifying the volumes of the droplets .",
    "their volumes were inferred from all three incoming flow rates and the measured droplet distance .",
    "in this section we present several sets of measurements in which different parameters are varied .",
    "we measure their influence on the hydrodynamic resistance of the droplets , in order to see to what extent the assumptions ( a ) to  ( d ) may be applied .",
    "the varied parameters are the volume  @xmath76 of the droplets , their velocity , their viscosity  @xmath77 and their initial distance  @xmath53 .",
    "all these parameters influence the hydrodynamic resistance of droplets  which , strictly speaking , invalidates assumptions  ( b ) and  ( c ) .",
    "nevertheless , we will show that reliable results can be obtained with the newly proposed methods .",
    "their reliability is enforced by the comparison with the results from the pressure sensor as a reference .",
    "the first two presented results coincide well and show that the proposed small - loop and large - loop devices can be used to determine the hydrodynamic resistance of droplets .    from the remaining results we learn that the assumptions underlying these methods are not fulfilled for all driving parameters . on first sight",
    ", this appears as bad news for the methods we propose .",
    "however , we also find that there is always a parameter regime in which the assumptions are indeed valid .",
    "concretely , we find that both the droplet velocity and the inter - droplet distance must be kept sufficiently large .",
    "if we ensure that the velocity does not drop below a critical value , while varying for example the distance , the result is perfectly valid .",
    "we may use such a situation to extract the hydrodynamic resistance of the droplets .",
    "the results given in this section therefore present both a direct verification of the assumptions of the employed model and a measurement of the hydrodynamic resistance .      independently of the parameter variations , fig .",
    "[ vel_vs_qtot ] shows that the assumption  ( a ) holds in the performed experiments .",

    "[ ld_vs_vol ] depict a strong increase of the resistance with the volume , which is confirmed by the measurements of the pressure sensor .",
    "both methods yield coinciding values for the resistance .",
    "the increase can be understood by the fact that with growing volume the droplets fill the channel more closely and become longer .",
    "similar effects have been reported in refs .",
    "droplets of @xmath78 are nearly spherical when looked at from above .",
    "larger droplets are more elongated , giving rise to thin films of oil between the droplets and the channel walls .",
    "the viscous dissipation in these thin films is one of three possible reason for the enhancement of hydrodynamic resistance due to the presence of a droplet : generally speaking , each droplet perturbs the surrounding flow field , which would otherwise be an axial poiseuille - type flow , see fig .",
    "[ eddies ] and ref .",
    "the kinematic boundary condition at the boundary of the droplet enforces the presence of several counter - rotating eddies inside and outside the droplet .",
    "figure  [ eddies ] contains only those eddies which are necessary to ensure a continuous velocity field .",
    "in particular , the tangent velocity has to be continuous at the droplet boundary . due to their different viscosities",
    ", the eddies inside and outside the droplet may contribute differently to the total hydrodynamic resistance of a droplet .",
    "a third contribution comes from the thin fluid film between droplet interface and channel wall .",
    "its reduced thickness leads to large velocity gradients and thus also to viscous dissipation .",
    "as the droplet resistances at different volumes are compared , it is not only the thin - film contribution which changes . together with the more elongated shape of the interfaces , also the precise shape of the interior eddies change .",
    "the viscous dissipation within the droplet strongly depends on the details of the eddies , in particular on the ratio between the round backflows near the caps of the droplet and the rather `` poiseuille - like '' parts in the interior of a long droplet . at this point",
    ", nothing can be said about the relative importance of the viscous dissipation in the thin film and in the eddies .",
    "we will return to this point below , in the discussion of the distance between droplets .    in the experiment of fig .",

    "the uncertainties can , however , be reduced either by using a ratio  @xmath55 closer to unity , or by investigating narrower channels . in the latter case , the droplet distance up to which cooperative effects occur , should be decreased together with the width / height of the channel .",
    "the necessity to work at distances larger than @xmath101 in order to guarantee the validity of assumption  ( b ) , has already been taken into account in the previously described measurements .",
    "the decrease of resistance at distances smaller than @xmath101 gives evidence to a collective motion of the droplet .",
    "this means that a pair or series of droplets can be displaced more easily than the same number of individual droplets .",
    "this observation sheds light on the relative importance of the three different contributions to the hydrodynamic resistance , as mentioned above in the discussion of fig .  [ eddies ] .",
    "in the literature on ( inviscid ) bubbles , the contribution from the thin film has been considered as the primary reason for hydrodynamic resistance  @xcite .",

    "[ ld_vs_lambda ] proves that in our case the thin - film contribution can not be dominant but that the eddies outside of the droplet contribute equally . from fig .",

    "a non - trivial dependence of the parameters is found when varying two of them at the same time .",

    "[ ld_vs_vol ] .",
    "the corresponding large - loop resistances are systematically smaller .",
    "the error bars and an independent measurement with the pressure sensor both indicate that the difference is not an artifact .",
    "the discrepancy is misleading , since the difference here is due to the smaller inter - droplet distance of approximately @xmath102 in the large - loop experiment .",
    "for the volume of  @xmath108 , we find the same value @xmath109 in fig .",
    "[ ld_vs_lambda ] at this very distance .",
    "the resistance length , when measured with the small - loop device , is approximately @xmath85 at a volume of @xmath108 .",
    "this value is approximately the one of the plateau at large distances in fig .",
    "[ ld_vs_lambda ] .",
    "we may thus conclude that the small - loop device really measures the resistances of individual droplets , and that this resistance corresponds to the plateau at large distances in the large - loop device .",
    "figure  [ ld_vs_vol2 ] leads us to a comment which we consider central in the analysis of droplet traffic in networks .",
    "when droplets are driven through a complex and possibly large network of microfluidic channels , comprising a lot of junctions , then no direct control over parameters such as their distance or their velocity is possible .",
    "when the droplet trains in an existing device exhibit irregularities , i.e.  that they do not follow the trajectory they are supposed to follow in order to fulfill the objective of the device , then it will become necessary to understand the droplet dynamics in more detail .",
    "the present work demonstrates some aspects of this understanding for a simple device , where the mutual influence of the hydrodynamic resistance and the droplet movement becomes apparent .",
    "in the present paper we use three methods to measure the effective hydrodynamic resistance of droplets in microchannels : one standard method based on the use of pressure sensors and two variants of a new method relying on the analysis of droplet trajectories in a simple microfluidic device .",
    "these two variants are proposed as complementary techniques , as they are based on different model assumptions on the droplet behavior in the microfluidic network .",
    "the main idea put forward here is to use the global droplet dynamics , namely the distances between droplets , their number in each branch of the loop , and the choices taken at the first junction .",
    "all of them can simply be extracted by analyzing a video of the droplets flowing .",
    "the methods are non - invasive as they do not require additional measuring channels for pressure sensors , nor do they require expensive equipment .",
    "the interpretation of these observables to obtain the resistances is based on a theoretical model , the simplifying assumptions of which we test in the present work .",
    "the proposed methods focus rather on the understanding of the droplet dynamics than on the isolated measurement of the all - parameter dependence of the hydrodynamic resistance of droplets . in this sense , it is not meant to replace the standard method employing pressure sensors , but rather to provide a guided example for how the droplet dynamics reacts on variations of the hydrodynamic resistance and vice versa .",
    "we were able to show that there exists a parameter regime where the assumptions adopted by the model do hold .",
    "in this regime , the quantity that we extracted from the experimental observations indeed serves as the wanted hydrodynamic resistance of droplets .",
    "these results are presented in figs .",
    "[ ld_vs_vol ] , [ ld_vs_v ] , [ ld_vs_eta ] , [ ld_vs_lambda ] , and  [ ld_vs_vol2 ] , where we varied different parameters , namely the volume , velocity and viscosity of droplets , as well as their distance .",
    "all these sets of measurements were done in a way such that they avoid those parameter regimes where the model assumptions are not valid .",
    "therefore , they do not contradict each other .",
    "this claim is enforced by independent and more direct measures of the droplet resistances , undertaken with an expensive and elaborate pressure - sensor technique . the requirement to find the ( formerly unknown ) valid part of a high - dimensional parameter space presented the main intellectual difficulty while generating the results displayed in the figures .",
    "the parameter dependencies we found are the following : the hydrodynamic resistance increases with increasing volume and increasing viscosity of the droplet .",
    "it increases with inter - droplet distances as long as the distances are smaller than approx .",
    "@xmath101 . beyond that value",
    "the resistance does not depend on the inter - droplet distance . for small droplet velocities ,",
    "the resistance strongly decreases with increasing velocity .",
    "it changes only little for velocities beyond @xmath110 . on a more fundamental level of description ,",
    "the results presented here demand a systematic determination of the hydrodynamic resistance as a function of droplet volume , spacing , velocity and viscosity .",
    "this could be done for example by extending refs .",
    "@xcite , which are concerned with the resistance of inviscid bubbles , not droplets . in the limit of high velocities , large distances , and small volumes",
