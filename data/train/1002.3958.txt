    "due to energy and environment issues , it becomes important to understand the thermal properties of materials .",
    "recently many efforts are to seek efficient thermoelectric materials because there exist potential applications of solid state thermal devices.@xmath0 nevertheless , the optimization of thermoelectric properties of materials is extremely difficult , since the figure of merit ( @xmath1 ) depends on seebeck coefficient(s ) , electrical conductance ( @xmath2 ) and thermal conductance ( @xmath3 ) of the material .",
    "tuning one of these physical quantities will unavoidably alter the other because they are closely related.@xmath4    several methods were proposed to realize the enhancement of zt,@xmath5 one of them is to reduce the system",

    "a zero - dimension qd system was predicted to have more pronounced enhancement in thermoelectric efficiency due the reduced dimensionality@xmath12 .",
    "experimentally , it has been shown@xmath11 that the performance of pbsete qds can reach a very impressive @xmath13 value of 2 . nevertheless , a zt value higher than 3 has never been reported .",
    "note that the highest zt value is near 1 for conventional bulk materials.@xmath14 systems with @xmath13 value larger than 3 may find application in making home refrigerators , replacing the existing compressor - based refrigerators .",
    "in addition , they can used in electrical power generators.@xmath5    in order to seek a large zt value , a single molecular qd weakly linked to electrodes was proposed to exhibit an extremely large zt value in the coulomb blockade regime.@xmath15 however , reference [ 10 ] did not take into account the molecular vibrations . for a molecular junction ,",
    "the coupling strengthes between localized electrons and vibration modes are very strong.@xmath16 due to multiple phonon assisted processes arising from strong electron phonon interactions , it is expected that zt values will be suppressed by molecular vibrations .",
    "apart from that , such a molecular junction is difficult to integrate with current silicon based electronics .",
    "therefore , we propose to use a thermoelectric device made of semiconductor qds embedded into amorphous insulator which has low heat conductivity .",
    "the studied system is shown in fig .",
    "1 . in addition",
    ", a nanoscale vacuum layer is inserted to block the heat current delivered by phonon carriers , although it would be a challenging task to keep the vacuum layer thin enough to allow sufficient electron tunneling . the vacuum layer considered here",
    "can be realized using the technology similar to that used in liquid crystal display implementation where a vacuum layer is inserted for blocking the heat generated by the light source .",
    "the key applications of thermoelectric devices include solid state refrigerators and electrical generators . in solid state refrigerators ( electrical generators )",
    ", one needs to remove ( generate ) large amount of heat current ( charge current ) .",
    "consequently , a high qd density is required for realistic applications .",
    "a single level anderson model can be used to simulate such a system adequately in the dilute qd - density limit.@xmath15 however , for the high qd - density system , one needs to consider the effect of interdot coulomb interactions and electron hopping effect . when qds are embedded in an insulator matrix having a high potential barrier , electron hopping among dots can be neglected .",
    "however , it is hard to avoid the interdot coulomb interactions due to its long - range tail .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effect of interdot coulomb interactions on the thermoelectric properties in the linear and nonlinear response regimes via a multi - level anderson model@xmath17 .",
    "we found that the interdot coulomb interactions would suppress the zt values and play a crucial role in determining the thermal rectification behavior .",
    "the electrical conductivity , thermal power , thermal conductivity and figure of merit were typically calculated in the linear response regime , while crucial applications of thermal devices in thermal rectifiers and transistors require the understanding of the thermoelectric properties in the nonlinear response regime.@xmath18 the thermal rectifiers can be used in solar energy storage and many other applications .",
    "therefore , it is important to take into account the thermoelectric effects in the nonlinear regime . here",
    ", we demonstrate that coupled qds can exhibit pronounced thermal rectification behavior .",
    "although the mechanism of thermal rectification for qd junctions is similar to that of charge current , the heat current is generated by temperature gradient and the consequent electrochemical potential .",
    "it is the nonlinear relation between the applied temperature gradient and the electrochemical potential that leads to enhance thermal rectification behavior .",

    "the results of fig . 3 indicate considerable reduction of zt at high temperatures due to the interdot coulomb interactions ( proximity effect ) .",
    "however , the proximity effect on zt can be ignored when @xmath147 . in general , the maximum values of interdot coulomb interactions are one - half of intradot coulomb interactions . for silicon qds",
    "embedded in @xmath148 , the si qds with @xmath149 nm diameters have the intradot coulomb interaction strengthes between @xmath150mev .",

    "4 , we plot zt as a function of @xmath120 for the three - qd system with and without coulomb interactions for various temperatures . for the noninteracting case ( thin solid line with mark )",
    ", the maximum zt value occurred at @xmath151 , which has been pointed out in ref . 10",
    ". however , for the case with finite electron coulomb interactions , we found @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "it is worth noting that the maximum zt values for different temperatures still reach @xmath155 , which are very encouraging values .",
    "however , we have not considered the qd size fluctuations , defects between metallic electrodes and insulators , and electron - phonon interactions . in order to include these affects",
    "fully , we phenomenologically replace the imaginary part of retarded green function of eq .",

    "this means the total level - width is expressed as the sum of elastic and inelastic widths .",
    "5 shows the inelastic scattering effect on zt . for @xmath157 ,",
    "the maximum zt value becomes smaller than 4 .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "5 indicate that the suppression of @xmath158 resulting from the inelastic scattering is serious .",
    "to further understand the results of figs . 3 and 4",
    ", we analyze the electron conductance @xmath2 , thermal power s and electron thermal conductance @xmath104 of the system .",
    "shows @xmath2 , s and @xmath104 as functions of temperature for a three - qd cell for various configurations : @xmath146 ( dotted curves ) , @xmath144 and @xmath145 ( dashed curves ) , and @xmath142 and @xmath159 ( solid curves ) , which correspond to strong , medium , and weak proximity effects .",
    "we noticed from fig .",
    "6(b ) that the thermal power ( s ) is not sensitive to the proximity effect , which means the proximity effects on @xmath129 and @xmath160 are similar .",
    "thus , the zt behavior at high temperature shown in fig . 3 is mainly attributed to @xmath104 and @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath104 is enhanced [ see fig .",
    "6(c ) ] , but @xmath2 is suppressed [ see fig .",
    "6(a ) ] at high temperature when the proximity effect increases .",
    "this explains why zt is suppressed at high temperature with increasing proximity effect .",
    "the maximum absolute value of s appears at near @xmath161 , whereas the maximum zt value shown in fig .",
    "3 appears between @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "so the temperature dependence of zt is similar to that of the electrical conductivity @xmath2 , meaning that @xmath164 has a weak temperature dependence .    in fig .",
    "4 , we have tuned @xmath120 from 0 to @xmath165 .",
    "this implies that the energy levels of qds are shifted away from the fermi energy of electrodes .",
    "zt becomes small when @xmath166 .",
    "we can apply a gate voltage ( @xmath167 ) to move @xmath168 relative to @xmath41 . in .",
    "7 we plot @xmath2 , s and @xmath104 as functions of the gate voltage ( @xmath167 ) for various temperatures with @xmath120 fixed at @xmath169 .",
    "the electric conductance ( @xmath2 ) clearly exhibits a coulomb oscillation arising from the intradot and interdot coulomb interactions .",
    "the first three peaks of @xmath2 result from the resonant channels of poles at @xmath168 , @xmath170 , and @xmath171 for @xmath172 .",
    "other peaks can be readily identified by the resonant channels of retarded green function of eq .",
    "note that the resonant channel of @xmath173 (= @xmath174 ) is seriously suppressed due to the fact that all three qds are filled with one electron at that gate voltage .",
    "the coulomb oscillatory behavior of @xmath2 becomes smeared at higher temperatures .",
    "the thermal power ( @xmath103 ) exhibits a sawtooth - like shape with respect to gate voltage , which is consistent with the experimental observation.@xmath175 the sawtooth - like shape was also theoretically reported in the metallic single electron transistor,@xmath176 where the charging energies are homogeneous . in refs .",
    "25 and 26 , a model based on the rate equations was adopted .",
    "the thermal power @xmath103 can be tuned from negative to positive values . when the fermi energy matches a resonant channel ( @xmath2 reaches a maximum value ) the thermal power vanishes , since @xmath177 .",
    "when the fermi energy of electrodes is in the middle of two resonant channels , @xmath103 also vanishes .",
    "zero thermal power indicates that the current arising from temperature gradient can be self - consistently balanced without electrochemical potential .",
    "the behavior of @xmath104 is much more complicated than that of @xmath2 , since @xmath97 which consists of @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath178 .",
    "since @xmath104 is positive definite , we obtain the relation @xmath179 . when thermal power vanishes , @xmath180 . based on the results shown in fig . 7 , the optimized zt value",
    "does not match either the maximum @xmath2 ( good conductor ) or the minimum @xmath2 ( poor conductor ) .",
    "the largest value for zt is obtained midway between the good and poor conductors as illustrated in fig . 8 for @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "so far , our discussion is limited to the linear response regime with @xmath183 .",
    "some functionalities of thermal electric devices require that the applied temperature bias @xmath184 violates the @xmath183 condition . in the following study",
    ", the thermoelectric properties of qd junctions are investigated in the nonlinear response regime .",

    "28 theoretically studied the thermal power in the kondo regime based on one - level anderson model . here , we study the thermal electric effect of multiple qd junction in the coulomb blockade effect in the nonlinear regime .",
    "we show that in the nonlinear regime , the thermal rectification behavior can become quite pronounced .",

    "the approximation is not as good , but it still gives qualitatively correct behavior .",

    "in this case , we obtain a small heat current @xmath248 at @xmath249 , but a large heat current @xmath250 at @xmath251 and the rectification efficiency @xmath252 is 0.79 .",
    "however , the heat current for @xmath209 is small .",
    "for @xmath253 , we obtain @xmath254 at @xmath249,@xmath255 at @xmath251 , and @xmath256 .",
    "we see that the heat current is suppressed for @xmath226 with decreasing @xmath238 .",
    "this implies that it is important to blockade the heat current through dot a to observe the rectification effect .",
    "very clear ndtc is observed in fig .",
    "11(b ) for the @xmath253 case , while dtc is symmetric with respect to @xmath184 for the @xmath257 case .    from the experimental point of view",
    ", it is easier to measure the thermal power than the direction - dependent heat current .",
    "the thermal power as a function of @xmath184 is shown in fig .",
    "all curves except the dash - dotted line ( which is for the symmetrical tunneling case ) show highly asymmetrical behavior with respect to @xmath184 , yet it is not easy at all to judge the efficiency of the rectification effect from @xmath103 for small @xmath258 ( @xmath259 ) . thus",
    ", it is not sufficient to determine whether a single qd can act as an efficient thermal rectifier based on results obtained in the linear response regime of @xmath260.@xmath185 according to the thermal power values , the electrochemical potential @xmath192 can be very large .",
    "consequently , the shift of qd energy levels caused by @xmath198 is quite important . to illustrate the importance of this effect , we plot in fig",
    "12 the heat current for various values of @xmath261 for the case with @xmath209 , @xmath262 and @xmath263 .",
    "other parameters are kept the same as those for fig .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) curves are obtained by including ( excluding ) the energy shift @xmath264 .",
    "it is seen that the shift of qd energy levels due to @xmath198 can lead to significant change in the heat current .",
    "it is found that ndtc is accompanied with low heat current for the case of @xmath265 [ see fig .",
    "12(b ) ] . even though the heat current exhibits rectification effect for @xmath266 and @xmath242 , the thermal power has a very different behavior . from figs .",
    "11(c ) and 12(c ) , we see that the heat current is a highly nonlinear function of electrochemical potential , @xmath198 .",
    "consequently , the rectification effect is not straightforwardly related to the thermal power in this system .    because the position distribution fluctuation is common for qds",
    ", we investigate the interdot coulomb interactions on the rectification effect .",
    "13 shows the heat current , electrochemical potential and occupation number as functions of @xmath184 for various values of @xmath267 with @xmath265 .",
    "other parameters are the same as in fig . 12 . when @xmath268 , the rectification efficiency is suppressed seriously .",
    "the residue rectification mainly arises from the correlation between dot a and dot b. such results indicate that it is crucial to control the qd position in the implementation of qd thermal rectifiers .",
    "we find that the electrochemical potential is not significantly changed when @xmath267 decreases , whereas the heat current has a considerable variation .",
    "13(c ) shows the occupation numbers of dots a and c. @xmath269 are ignored due to their energy levels being far away from the fermi energy level .",
    "it is expected that @xmath220 is not sensitive to the decrease of @xmath267 .",
    "@xmath270 increases so much when @xmath267 decreases since the main resonant channels of dot c are dominated by @xmath261 rather than the combination of @xmath261 and @xmath271 .",
    "13(c ) reveals that the serious suppression of rectification efficiency of dot - dashed line shown in fig .",
    "13(a ) is mainly attributed to the heat current through dot c. we once again investigate the rectification efficiency for three - dot case .",
    "14 shows the rectification efficiency as function of @xmath184 .",
    "all other parameters are the same as those of fig .",
    "the rectification efficiency increases with increasing temperature bias .",
    "however , @xmath272 is not sensitive to the energy level of dot c.    comparing the heat current of the three - dot case ( shown in figs .",
    "11 and 12 ) to the two - dot case ( shown in fig .",
    "9 ) , we find that the rectification efficiency is about the same for both cases ( shown in figs .",
    "10 and 14 ) , while the magnitude of the heat current can be significantly enhanced in the three - dot case . for practical applications ,",
    "we need to estimate the magnitude of the heat current density and dtc of the iqv junction device in order to see if the effect is significant .",
    "we envision a thermal rectification device made of an array of multiple qds ( e.g. three - qd cells ) with a 2d density @xmath273 . for this device",
    ", the heat current density versus @xmath184 is given by figs .",
    "11 and 12 with the units @xmath274 replaced by @xmath275 , which is approximately @xmath276 if we assume @xmath277 .",
    "similarly , the units for dtc becomes @xmath278 , which is approximately @xmath279k .",
    "since the phonon contribution can be blocked by the vacuum layer in our design , this device could have practical applications near @xmath280k with ( @xmath281 ) .",
    "if we choose a higher tunneling rate @xmath282 and coulomb energy @xmath283 ( possible for qds with diameter less than 1 nm ) , then it is possible to achieve room - temperature operation .",
    "it is worth pointing out that if the vacuum layer is replaced by a typical phonon glass , such as sio@xmath7 , which has a thermal conductivity of @xmath284k [ 36 ] at room temperature , the heat current carried by phonons across a 10 nm junction with a temperature bias of 1@xmath285k would be around @xmath286 .",
    "this would completely dominate over the thermal electric effect considered here ( by six orders of magnitude ) . therefore , unless a vacuum layer is inserted , the term @xmath101 will play a dominant role .",
    "we have theoretically investigated the effect of intradot and interdot coulomb interactions on the figure of merit ( zt ) and thermal power ( s ) of multiple qd junction system in the sequential tunneling process .",
    "the zt values at high temperatures are significantly suppressed by the intradot as well as interdot coulomb interactions .",
    "the optimization of zt depends not only on temperature but also on the detuning energy ( @xmath287 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that inelastic scattering effect arising from qd size fluctuations , defects and electron - phonon interactions will lead to considerable reduction to the zt values .",
    "electrical conductance and thermal power exhibit coulomb oscillatory behavior and the sawtooth - like behavior with respect to the gate voltage .",
    "the largest value for zt is obtained midway between good and poor conductors .",
    "apart from the results of linear response , the heat rectification effect can be observed for multiple qd junctions in the nonlinear response regime .",
    "in contrast to the heat rectification of phonon junction system , the heat current is carried by electrons in the multiple qd junction system and large electrochemical potentials can be established by the temperature gradient to generate electrical power .",
