    "weakly bound systems represent an interesting field of research in atomic and molecular physics .",
    "the behavior of systems near a binding threshold is important in the study of ionization of atoms and molecules , molecule dissociation , and scattering collisions . since the pioneering works of bethe @xcite and hylleraas@xcite confirming the existence of the negative hydrogen ion , @xmath0 , the study of the stability of the ground state of atomic and molecular negative anions becomes an active field of research .",
    "new phenomena appear when the coulomb interaction is screened and the long - range electrostatic interactions turn to short - range potentials .",
    "a simple model to describe the effect of the screening in the coulomb potential is the yukawa potential , where an exponential decay is introduced , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a positive constant .",
    "the yukawa potential has been used in many branches of physics , for example to describe interactions in dusty plasmas where charged dust particles are surrounded by plasma @xcite , liquid metals @xcite , charged colloidal particles@xcite .",
    "two - electron systems interacting via yukawa potentials were the subject of recent research , studying the bound states using the hylleraas basis set @xcite and b - spline expansions @xcite . also , scattering processes were recently presented @xcite using yukawa potentials .    to examine near threshold behavior , the finite size scaling ( fss )",
    "approach is needed in order to extrapolate results obtained from finite systems to the complete basis set limit .",
    "fss is not only a formal way to understand the asymptotic behavior of a system when the size tends to infinity , but a theory that also gives us numerical methods capable of obtaining accurate results for infinite systems by studying the corresponding small systems@xcite .",
    "applications include expansion in slater - type basis functions@xcite , gaussian - type basis functions@xcite and recently , finite elements@xcite .    here",
    ", we combine fss with the b - splines expansion to calculate the stability diagram for two - electron atoms with a screened coulomb potential . the b - spline functions @xmath3 form a basis for piecewise polynomial functions that are polynomials of degree @xmath4 in each interval and whose derivatives up to order @xmath5 are continuous at the interior knots , have been increasingly used in atomic and molecular physics@xcite .",
    "our results show the b - splines functions are very efficient in performing fss to calculate the critical parameters and the stability diagram .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - two ]",
    "we present fss with a b - splines basis followed by the two - electron atom , as a benchmark calculation in section [ sec - three ] . in section",
    "[ sec - four ] , we present our main results for the screened two - electron atoms .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec - conclu ] we discuss our results and conclusions .",
    "here , we briefly introduce the finite size scaling ( for more details , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and how to perform calculations using b - splines .",
    "the finite size scaling method is a systematic way to extract the critical behavior of an infinite system from analysis on finite systems @xcite .",
    "it is efficient and accurate for the calculation of critical parameters for few - body schrdinger equation .    in our study , we have hamiltonian of the following form : @xmath6    where @xmath7 is @xmath8-independent and @xmath9 is the @xmath8-dependent term .",
    "we are interested in the study of how the different properties of the system change when the value of @xmath8 varies .",
    "a critical point , @xmath10 , will be defined as a point for which a bound state becomes absorbed or degenerate with a continuum .",
    "we also define a critical exponent @xmath11 by the asymptotic behavior of the ionization energy @xmath12 , where we assume that the threshold energy , @xmath13 , does not depend on @xmath8 . in the first example , the he - like atoms , we have only one parameter , @xmath8 while for the second case , the screened two electron atoms , we have two parameters , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . to perform the finite size scaling calculations , we expand the exact wave function in a finite basis set and truncate this expansion at some order @xmath16 .",
    "the finite size corresponds to the number of elements in a complete basis set used to expand the exact eigenfunction of a given hamiltonian .",
    "the ground - state eigenfunction has the following expansion:@xmath17 , where n is the set of quantum numbers .",
    "we have to truncate the series at order n , and the expectation value of any general operator @xmath18 at order n is given by : @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the matrix elements of @xmath18 in the basis set @xmath21 .    in this study we used the b - splines basis ,",
    "the normalized one - electron orbitals are given by @xmath22    where @xmath23 is a b - splines polynomial of order @xmath24 .",
    "the numerical results are obtained by defining a cutoff radius @xmath25 , and then the interval @xmath26 $ ] is divided into @xmath27 equal subintervals .",
    "b - spline polynomials @xcite ( for a review of applications of b - splines polynomials in atomic and molecular physics , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) are piecewise polynomials defined by a sequence of knots @xmath28 and the recurrence relations    @xmath29    @xmath30    in this work , we use the standard choice for the knots in atomic physics @xcite @xmath31 and @xmath32 . because we are interested in fss , we choose an equidistant distribution of inside knots .",
    "the constant @xmath33 in eq.(3 ) is a normalization constant obtained from the condition @xmath34 ,    @xmath35^{1/2 } } \\,.\\ ] ]    because @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we have @xmath38 orbitals corresponding to @xmath39 .",
    "in all the calculations we used the value @xmath40 , and , we do not write the index @xmath24 in the eigenvalues and coefficients .    to obtain the numerical values of the critical parameters @xmath41 for the energy , we define for",
    "any given operator @xmath18 the function    @xmath42    if we take the operator @xmath18 to be @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , we can obtain the critical parameters from the following function @xcite    @xmath45    which at the critical point is independent of @xmath16 and @xmath46 and takes the value of @xmath11 .",
    "namely , for @xmath47 and any values of @xmath16 and @xmath46 we have @xmath48    because our results are asymptotic for large values of @xmath16 , we obtain a sequence of pseudocritical parameters @xmath49 that converge to @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "as a benchmark for fss using b - splines we calculate the critical parameters of the two - electron atom with standard coulomb potential . in this case , after a scaling with the nuclear charge , the system has a unique parameter @xmath52",
    "@xmath53    the ground - state energy @xmath54 and its corresponding eigenvector @xmath55 will be calculated within the variational approximation    @xmath56    where the @xmath57 must be chosen adequately and @xmath58 is the basis set size .    since we are interested in the behavior of the system near the ground - state ionization threshold , we choose as basis set s - wave singlets given by    @xmath59    where @xmath60 .",
    "also , we introduce a cutoff value @xmath61 for the angular momentum @xmath62 , denote @xmath63 as the singlet spinor , and the @xmath64 are given by @xmath65 _ i.e. _ they are eigenfunctions of the total angular momentum with zero eigenvalue , and the @xmath66 are the spherical harmonics .",
    "note also that @xmath67 is a real function since it is symmetric in the particle index .",
    "the radial term @xmath68 has the appropriate symmetry for a singlet state ,    @xmath69    in general , the size @xmath58 of a basis set defined for eqs.([variational - functions]-[radial - sym ] ) is @xmath70 . for the radial orbitals we used normalized b - splines polynomial of order @xmath24",
    "@xmath71    the calculations in this sections were done with @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .    in order to calculate the hamiltonian matrix elements , we expand the electronic coulomb interaction in spherical harmonics    @xmath74    because the cutoff @xmath61 , the matrix elements of this expansion are nonzero only for @xmath75 .    in our previous studies , the critical behavior of the two - electron atom was obtained by using fss approach with hylleraas @xcite and gaussian basis sets @xcite .",
    "the fss was performed with a finite small basis - set and then increased the number of basis functions @xmath16 in a systematic way .",
    "the b - splines basis - set , in this sense is different .",
    "when @xmath16 is changed , we are not adding new functions , but the complete basis - set is changed in a way which is similar to the finite - element method @xcite .",
    "figure 1 , shows the results for the plot @xmath76 as @xmath8 varies for different values of @xmath16 .",
    "successive curves cross at pseudocritical points . in figures ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , we observed the behavior of the pseudocritical parameters , @xmath77 and @xmath78 as a function of @xmath79 .",
    "the two curves converged to the exact values , in complete agreement with our previous @xcite and recent results@xcite .",
    "the numerical values are shown in table [ table_comp ] .",
    "these accurate results indicate that fss can be combined with b - spline basis to obtain critical parameters for the few - body schrdinger equation .    [",

    "the hamiltonian , in atomic units , takes the form , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the nuclear charge and @xmath82 the debye screening length .",
    "the hamiltonian takes a form more convenient to our purposes after scaling with @xmath2 , @xmath83 and @xmath84    @xmath85    where @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "the numerical results are obtained using the same basis set as the coulomb case described in section iii , except the value of the cutoff radius , that for the yukawa potential we set as @xmath88 .    for the yukawa potential we use the gegenbauer s expansion in",
    "spherical harmonics    @xmath89    where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the modified bessel functions of the first and second kind , respectively @xcite .    since @xmath13",
    "does not depend on @xmath15 , we calculate the scaling function @xmath76 for given values of @xmath14 as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "figure [ ygamma ] , show the results for the plot @xmath92 as @xmath15 varies for different values if @xmath16 .",
    "all the curves cross very close to the critical point . in figure [ ypd ]",
    "we present the phase diagram for the screened two - electron atoms with three distinct phases : two - electron phase ( @xmath93 ) , one - electron phase ( @xmath94 ) and zero - electron phase ( @xmath95 ) , corresponding to stable , ionized and double ionized atoms .",
    "the dotted line @xmath96 corresponds to the critical value of the one - electron yukawa potential .",
    "therefore , there are no bound states for @xmath97 . for @xmath98 the one - body bound state",
    "is extended , and the method is applicable until the size of the one - body state becomes of the order of the cutoff radius @xmath25 . for the value @xmath88 , we calculate the @xmath94stability line for @xmath99 .",
    "reference @xcite described the three different ground - state stability diagrams that a two - parameter hamiltonian with short - range one - body potential could present .",
    "these cases are ( see figure 1 of this reference ) ( a ) no @xmath100 line , ( b ) exists a finite @xmath100 line for @xmath101 , ( c ) the @xmath100 line is infinite . also in this reference rigorous lower and upper bound for the @xmath102 stability line are established .",
    "we calculate these bounds for the hamiltonian eq([hamil ] ) . the lower bound is shown in figure [ ypd ] . for the yukawa potential",
    "the upper bound diverges for @xmath103 , and then it is not useful in this case .",
    "even our results suggest that the ground - state stability diagram is of type ( a ) .",
    "large numerical instabilities could appear for @xmath104 , and then we can discard a type ( c ) diagram , but we can not discard a type ( b ) diagram with a small value of @xmath105 .",
    "we note that the @xmath0 atom corresponds to the line @xmath106 and the he atom to the line @xmath107 .",
    "these lines are also indicated in figure [ ypd ] .",
    "the critical screening values for h@xmath108 and he are @xmath109 and @xmath110 respectively .    in figure [ yalpha ]",
    "we show how the critical exponent @xmath111 vs @xmath14 for @xmath112 for the screened two - electron atom converges to the exact value , @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the introduction of b - spline basis sets in fss calculations is very powerful in obtaining critical parameters and stability diagrams for few - body systems .",
    "this basis set presents very different characteristics than the standard basis sets previously used in fss like hylleraas or slater - type basis sets .",
    "b - splines are non - zero only on a small interval , and changing the fss parameter n ( number of basis functions ) changes the complete basis set .",
    "in particular , we used this basis set together with fss to calculate the critical parameter of the helium - like atom as a benchmark , finding very accurate results .",
    "we then applied the method to the important case of the ground - state stability diagram for a two - electron atom interacting via a screened coulomb potential .",
    "also in this case , fss with a b - spline basis - set proves to be an excellent approach to obtain the critical behavior for this two - parameter hamiltonian .",
    "our results show that the ground - state diagram of two - electron atoms interacting via yukawa potentials does not present a @xmath100 line . that is , the systems always undergoes a @xmath102 transition before losing both electrons as the screening grows .",
    "even the numerical results are not accurate enough to discard a small @xmath100 line .",
    "we discard the existence of an infinite @xmath100 line .",
    "we have shown in previous works that fss combined with different basis functions ( hylleraas , gaussian , slater ) is a powerful method to obtain quantum critical parameters for few - body systems @xcite . however , these basis sets are not useful to calculate critical parameter for large systems , or for quantum phase transitions in infinite systems . a possible way to apply fss to study quantum phase transitions in materials",
    "is to combine fss with hatree - fock or density functional approaches . in this direction ,",
    "new efficient methods to solve the hartree - fock equations using b - splines expansions were recently established @xcite , and numerical codes are available @xcite . as a benchmark system , we started with the two electron atoms .",
    "we show that indeed this can be done and obtained very accurate quantum critical parameters .",
    "then we went to a more difficult case , two - electron atoms with screened coulomb potentials .",
    "getting all the stability and transition lines from two - electrons to one - electron to zero - electrons is numerically difficult calculations .",
    "we have shown that fss with b - spline basis functions can construct the full stability diagram .",
    "our work is in progress to calculate critical parameters for large i molecular and extended systems by applying fss with b - spline expansions of hatree - fock equations .",
