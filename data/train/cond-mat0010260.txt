    "the defining property of superconductors , the well known meiner effect , is to expel an ( undercritical ) magnetic field from its bulk .",
    "this property reverses itself when the superconductor is rotated , and a spontaneous magnetic field appears  again in the bulk , one or two penetration lengths away from the surface .",
    "this is usually referred to as the london moment  @xcite .",
    "its magnitude is  @xcite @xmath0{\\boldsymbol\\omega},\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the rotational velocity , @xmath2 the vacuum light velocity , @xmath3 the bare mass , and @xmath4 the charge , of the electron ; finally , @xmath5 is a relativistically small correction .",
    "all theories and experiments agree that @xmath5 is small , but strong disagreement exists with respect to its actual value and sign .",
    "the microscopic theories , by anderson  @xcite , brady  @xcite , cabrera and coworkers  @xcite , and baym  @xcite take the main correction to be positive and given by the fermi velocity , @xmath6 the thermodynamic theory , on the other hand , finds @xmath5 to be negative , and very much smaller  @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the chemical potential of the metal , the energy needed to add a unit mass to the superconducting solid .",
    "( since the solid holds its atoms together , the chemical potential @xmath8 is necessarily a negative quantity . )",
    "the value of @xmath9 makes the correction negligible for all conceivable purposes and renders eq([0 ] ) , taking the values of @xmath10 and @xmath2 as given , a very precise expression for @xmath11  about three orders of magnitude more precise than any present experimental technique to determine the electron mass directly  @xcite .    generally speaking ,",
    "although the thermodynamic , macroscopic theory lacks details and is incapable of answering many quantitative questions , it is nevertheless a rigorous theory , and uniquely appropriate for understanding the london moment .",
    "this is because ( i ) the london moment is an equilibrium phenomenon , ( ii ) the measurement concerns a quotient between two macroscopic fields , @xmath12 and @xmath1 , and most importantly , ( iii ) the reason for the microscopic parameters of @xmath3 and @xmath10 to appear on the macroscopic level is due to simple symmetry principles , rather than some detailed properties of the interaction .    comparing both types of theories in detail",
    ", we find their difference to be easy to bridge , if the relations between some thermodynamic and microscopic quantities had been clear beforehand . more specifically , it is the incorrect identification of electrostatic and chemical potentials on one hand , the work function , mean - field potential and fermi energy of the electron on the other that has led to the above discrepancy .",
    "the correct identification of these quantities is of rather general interest and transcends the understanding of the london moment alone .",
    "the proper identification is the most important result of the present paper .",
    "another problem clouding the understanding of the london moment is the disagreement between experiment and all theories .",
    "although this remains a point we do not understand , we took a step towards its clarification by achieving understanding of the following point : the best present experiment measures the flux , @xmath13 @xmath14 , outside the rotating superconductor  @xcite .",
    "two effects contribute the this flux , the london moment , and the so - called double layer .",
    "the latter is a result of the fact that a metal may be conceived of as an electrostatic potential of the square - well form , with the depth @xmath15 .",
    "as the metal rotates , this discontinuity in the rest - frame electrostatic potential produces a discontinuity in the laboratory - frame vector potential , @xmath16 and this also contributes to the flux @xmath17 , with a contribution much larger than the relativistic correction of the london moment .",
    "it has been generally suspected that both contributions are experimentally inseparable , that they are always measured in conjunction .",
    "( a double layer of opposite charge  or one layer of dipoles",
    " produces a discontinuity in the electrostatic potential , hence the name . )",
    "we disagree . in this paper",
    ", we shall discuss both effects separately , as only the first is universal ",
    "the second varies with materials , and is quite independent from superconductivity .",
    "besides , we believe that these effects may in principle be measured independently . taking the superconductor to be a cylinder rotating around its axis , the london moment may be measured immediately outside its top or bottom surface , where any magnetic field @xmath18 is continuous , see fig  1 .",
    "( it is not continuous across the cylinder surface , where the field drops to zero within a few penetration lengths , due to the presence of persistent currents . )",
    "the flux from the double layer alone may be seen above @xmath19 , or in the experiment proposed in chapter  [ exp ] .    .",
    "]    in chapter  [ 1 ] , we shall present the simple yet stringent macroscopic calculation leading to the london moment .",
    "this is followed in chapter  [ 3 ] by a comparison to the microscopic results , which are brought into agreement with the macroscopic ones by the appropriate identification of the above mentioned thermodynamic and microscopic quantities . in chapter  [ 4 ] , we consider the effect of the double layer , the contribution of which may be measured in the experiment described in chapter  [ exp ] .",
    "given any neutral , macroscopic system , we may either change its numbers of electrons and ions , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , or its mass and charge , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "they are related as @xmath24 ( @xmath25 and @xmath3 denote the bare mass of the ion and electron , respectively , and @xmath4 is the elementary charge . ) frequently , the number of atoms @xmath26 is used instead of the mass @xmath22 .",
    "the energy of these changes are given by the respective chemical potentials , @xmath27 where employing eqs  ( [ a1],[1a ] ) , we see the chemical potentials to be related as @xmath28 because @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively denote the energy needed to bring an electron , an ion , an atom , unit mass and unit charge from infinity to inside the system , these are fixed quantities , and we are not at liberty to alter them by an additive constant .",
    "we especially have @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the electrostatic potential , which is fixed only up to an arbitrary gauge transformation , and which forms a 4-vector with the vector potential @xmath36 .",
    "note that the energy and chemical potentials employed in this paper include the rest mass , because otherwise the relativistic transformation formulas of the following sections will not work .",
    "hence we define the non - relativistic chemical potentials with tilde , @xmath37 usually , both @xmath38 and @xmath39 are of the order of a few ev , this being the scale of atomic physics , cf an early model - calculation  @xcite . since @xmath40 ,",

    "consider a square - well potential , fig 2 , a popular model for metals . taking the outside value of the energy as zero ,",
    "the depth of the well is @xmath116 , with @xmath117 the mean - field potential for electrons ; filling the potential up to the fermi energy @xmath118 , the gap still remaining may be identified as the work function of the electron @xmath119 .",
    "together , they satisfy @xmath120 when making contact with thermodynamics , there are no doubts that the identification @xmath121 holds , because the physical significance of @xmath122 and @xmath123 , the energy needed to take out an electron , and the energy gained when putting one in , respectively , is the same .",
    "the other two scales , the fermi energy @xmath124 and the mean - field potential @xmath117 , are model - dependent quantities , with a large measure of arbitrariness attached to them .",
    "so we should not expect them to be directly measurable , or connected to thermodynamic quantities in a simple fashion . nevertheless , all mentioned authors employing the microscopic approach to understand the london moment  @xcite adopt the identification @xmath125 with some apparently plausible consequences .",
    "first , with eqs  ( [ mm ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) , we have @xmath126 with @xmath127 this makes the mass correction positive , and rather tangible : with the estimates @xmath128ev , @xmath129ev , and @xmath130 ev ( by averaging the electron wave functions over the fermi surface ) , the value @xmath131 was found  @xcite for the mass correction  as compared to @xmath132 of the last section",
    ". moreover , with @xmath133 , eq  ( [ mm ] ) delivers the simple , kinematic - relativistic interpretation for the mass correction , @xmath134 so why do we claim that eqs  ( [ ! ? ] , [ mm],[kr ] ) are in error ?",
    "the identification of eq  ( [ ! ? ] ) is made by taking the macroscopic electrostatic potential @xmath15 as the potential felt by superconducting electrons from _ `` all charge distributions in the metal , such as surface dipoles ... , the screening hole ... , and charge inhomogeneities associated with atomic cores and valence electrons '' _  @xcite .",
    "( sentences in italic are quotes , here and below . ) clearly , the one ostentatiously lacking in this list is the contribution from the other band electrons ( including the superconducting ones ) , to the potential , which brings the potential energy , gained by the last electron to be added to the system , to @xmath135 cf eq  ( [ 7b ] ) .",
    "this is the thermodynamic definition of the potential @xmath33 , see the discussion of the last section , and we are not at liberty to alter it .",
    "in fact , as already mentioned , it would have been highly surprising for the directly measurable macroscopic electrostatic potential @xmath35 that forms a 4-vector with the vector potential @xmath36 to be simply related to the model - dependent mean - field potential @xmath117 .    , the work function @xmath122 , the fermi energy @xmath136 , and the mean - field potential @xmath137 , close to a metal surface . ]",
    "this still leaves the kinetic - relativistic interpretation of the fermi velocity , eq  ( [ kr ] ) , intact .",
    "as it is a rather popular preconception , and employed by two more recent papers without the detour via the fermi energy  @xcite , we need to emphasize here that it is really only correct for free particles , and does not work for strongly interacting systems .    to understand this , consider an atom , consisting of an electron and an ion  the same way the metal consists of band electrons and the rest .",
    "we may write the energy of the atom as @xmath138 , or @xmath139 where the superscript @xmath140 denotes the effective mass including the mass defect , while @xmath122 the binding energy between the electron and the ion , the analogue of the work function above . note that the binding energy @xmath122 includes all contributions , especially the kinetic energy of the electron .",
    "microscopically , we may divide @xmath122 between @xmath141 and @xmath64 arbitrarily .",
    "but if the division is in proportion to the rest mass , a natural ( if not obvious ) procedure , the mass defect of the electron is @xmath142 in agreement with the result of the last section , see eqs  ( [ 6a],[7f],[mm ] ) .",
    "baym considered the problem of mass correction within the landau theory of fermi liquid in his work@xcite .",
    "the theory is beyond the usual mean - field approach , and accounts for many - body effects .",
    "because his arguments and calculations are complicated , we shall only quote his final expression , @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the kinetic energy of a fermi electron , similar to @xmath145 above , while the last two terms are new : @xmath146 is given by _  the average of the electrostatic potential within a given unit cell _",
    "( eg the wigner - seitz cell ) , _ arising from the charges within the cell . \" _ and @xmath147 is _  the interaction energy of an electron at the fermi surface , containing electrostatic as well as exchange contributions _ ( but excluding the boundary dipole layer ) . \"",
    "the value of @xmath148 was given as @xmath149 , while the value of @xmath147 remains unknown .",
    "because @xmath147 not only includes many - body interactions , but also electrostatic contribution , it may well be an appreciable term , canceling other contributions to yield virtually vanishing total correction , in agreement with the thermodynamic result .",
    "baym also points out that corrections from the presence of the lattice are to be expected , because the landau fermi liquid theory is confined to translationally invariant systems , of which metal electrons are not one .",
    "only a generalized landau theory that also considers the ions would indeed be dealing with a system that is , in its totality , translationally invariant .",
    "this should result in more generally valid relations , replacing relations such as @xmath150 \\boldsymbol{j}_s$ ] as given in  @xcite , with @xmath151 \\boldsymbol{j}_s$ ] , or eq  ( [ 23 ] ) .",
    "because of the presence of surface dipoles , the electrostatic potential is discontinuous at the surface of the superconductor , @xmath152 . if the metal is in rotation , the vector potential will also be discontinuous , contributing to the total flux of the system in the laboratory frame . since the magnitude of this is @xmath153 , taking @xmath154 either as @xmath155ev , eq  ( [ 7b],[7a ] ) , or as @xmath156ev , eq  ( [ ! ? ] ) , clearly makes a big difference .",
    "as argued at length in the last two sections , we believe the first is correct , as does the book  @xcite by landau and lifshitz , who unequivocally pronounced the equality between the work function and the potential s discontinuity , @xmath157 , see  23 .",
    "the jump of the vector potential follows from the lorentz transformation property of the electromagnetic 4-potential @xmath158 .",
    "consider a frame co - moving with the metal .",
    "if @xmath159 denotes the electric potential outside the metal , the potential inside the metal will be @xmath160 .",
    "so the 4-potential @xmath161 in the local rest frame is @xmath162 outside the metal , and @xmath163 inside it . in the laboratory frame ,",
    "the 4-potential @xmath158 becomes , in linear order of @xmath56 , @xmath164 outside the metal , and @xmath165 inside the metal , where @xmath166 is the velocity of the boundary .",
    "so the discontinuity in the vector potential is @xmath167 for a metal cylinder uniformly rotating about the z - axis @xmath168 , we have @xmath169 , with @xmath170 the position vector of the boundary . so the magnetic flux of a non - superconducting , rotating metal is @xmath171 since the experiment  @xcite measures both this boundary flux and the london field simultaneously , it is convenient to introduce an observed mass @xmath172 ( if the effect due to the penetration depth is negligible , as is the case in  @xcite ) . we write it as @xmath173 where @xmath174 accounts for the flux from the boundary double layer . in the cited microscopic considerations ,",
    "@xcite it is the fermi energy , @xmath130ev , that enters @xmath175 , and the mean - field potential , @xmath176ev , that enters @xmath174 , though in opposite directions .",
    "combined , the observed mass is corrected only by the work function @xmath177 @xmath178ev , cf eq  ( [ epsi ] ) , leading to a total correction of about @xmath179 .",
    "thermodynamically , although @xmath180 is negligible , but the work function @xmath122 does enters @xmath181 , so the measured effect is again given by a value around @xmath182ev .",
    "since the same value for @xmath172 is predicted by all theories , one may conjecture that the values of @xmath183 or @xmath174 individually are unimportant , because any experiment can only observe @xmath184 @xmath185 .",
    "this does not seem right to us .",
    "first , both the strength of surface double layer of a metal and the london field are well defined physical quantities . and the parameters @xmath183 and @xmath174 are unambiguously related to the chemical potential and the work function , respectively .",
    "second , both effects are ( at least in principle ) independently measurable .",
    "the london field could be observed directly by measuring the flux near the top - center of a rotating superconductor ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and the flux from the double layer only may be observed in the normal state , or even in the superconducting state , by the method given in the next chapter .",
    "consider two concentric , co - rotating , hollow cylinders , made of the same superconducting metal .",
    "the electric current @xmath186 flowing through the inner cylinder is measured by a squid , see fig  3 .",
    "the cylinders rotate with the angular velocity @xmath1 .",
    "we calculate the magnetic field and the current in the apparatus . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the cylinders are of infinite height , and no surface charges ( or electric field ) are present .",
    "this geometry was firstly analyzed by brady  @xcite , who estimated the effect of penetration depths @xmath187 by simply assuming constant magnetic fields in the regimes : @xmath188 and @xmath189 , in other words , by assuming that the actual internal spaces , @xmath190 and @xmath191 , are increases by @xmath187 at the superconducting boundaries . moreover , because the magnitudes of the field was estimated by dividing the magnetic flux by the respective area , the contributions from the boundary layer have also been neglected .",
    "the current @xmath186 in the inner cylinder as determined by brady is proportional to the observed mass @xmath172 and the difference of the angular velocities of the two cylinders .",
    "this was given as a method to measure the london field . in our case ,",
    "both angular velocities are the same , so @xmath186 would vanish in his approximation .",
    "our more detailed calculation , however , shows that @xmath186 is finite and observable if the distance between the two cylinders , @xmath192 , is small enough .",
    "in fact , it is proportional to @xmath193 , rendering @xmath174 , or the flux from the boundary layer , measurable .",

    "the conclusion of this paper is that the relativistic correction to the london field is not the result of the fermi velocity .",
    "instead , it is given by the chemical potential @xmath247 of the metal , which quantifies the complicated interaction among all the particles , including that between electrons and ions .",

    "in addition , the discontinuity of the macroscopic electrostatic potential at the metal surface was incorrectly taken to be the mean field potential , or the sum of the kinetic energy and the work function .",

    "<S> comparing various microscopic theories of rotating superconductors to the conclusions of thermodynamic considerations , we traced their marked difference to the question of how some thermodynamic quantities ( the electrostatic and chemical potentials ) are related to more microscopic ones : the electron s the work function , mean - field potential and fermi energy  </S>",
    "<S> certainly a question of general import .    </S>",
    "<S> after the correct identification is established , the relativistic correction for the london moment is shown to vanish , with the obvious contribution from the fermi velocity being compensated by other contributions such as electrostatics and interactions . </S>"
