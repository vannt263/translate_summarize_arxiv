    "chiral symmetry is a basic symmetry of massless qcd which leads to the conservation of the axial - vector current , apart from the axial anomaly in the singlet - flavor channel .",

    "the consequences of chiral symmetry for the qcd green functions in the non - perturbative region and the expansion of these functions in powers of the external momenta and the small quark masses have been worked out within chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "chiral symmetry in qcd is spontaneously broken , and therefore it is not a symmetry of the hadron spectrum : except for the existence of the octet of light pseudoscalars , the lowest part of the hadron spectrum shows no trace of chiral symmetry .",
    "because of confinement , the calculation of the hadron mass spectrum directly from the qcd lagrangian is a very challenging task , which requires a non - perturbative approach . for the description of the mass spectrum of hadrons and their interactions at low momentum transfers , qcd - inspired constituent quark models ( i.e. , models based on constituent - quark degrees of freedom in which mesons appear as @xmath2 bound states in a potential ) proved to be quite successful @xcite",
    "moreover , there are many pieces of evidence that the constituent - quark picture provides a good description not only of the mass spectrum of hadrons , but also of their interactions at not too large momentum transfers @xcite .",

    ", the noether axial current constructed in such models is not conserved .    in this paper",
    "we show that , nevertheless , a properly formulated constituent quark model has a `` chiral point '' which corresponds to the chiral limit of qcd .",
    "we start by constructing the full axial current of the constituent quarks by a summation of the infinite number of diagrams describing constituent - quark soft interactions . by requiring that the conservation of this current is violated only by terms @xmath0",
    ", we derive important constraints on the axial coupling of the constituent quark , @xmath3 , and on the @xmath2 potential at large distances .",
    "we then define the chiral point as those values of the quark - model parameters ( masses of the constituent quarks and couplings in the quark potential ) for which the mass of the pseudoscalar @xmath2 ground state vanishes .",
    "the following signatures of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry may be observed at the chiral point :    * the axial current of the constituent quarks is conserved .",
    "this requires a relation between the axial coupling of the constituent quark , @xmath6 , and the pion wave function @xmath7 in the chiral limit , which we derive explicitly . *",
    "the decay constant of the pion remains finite .",
    "* the decay constants of the excited massive pseudoscalars vanish .",

    "we obtain the constraint on the axial coupling of the constituent quark , @xmath6 , which provides the conservation of the full axial current of the constituent quarks when the mass of the lowest pseudoscalar @xmath11 bound state vanishes . the constraints on the @xmath11 potential which lead to a non - vanishing @xmath12 coupling in the chiral limit are derived . in section",

    "this leads to specific properties of its correlators @xcite .",
    "the coupling of a pseudoscalar meson to these currents has the form @xmath17 the divergence equation ( [ div ] ) requires @xmath18 implying that at least one of the quantities on the l.h.s .",

    "( [ relation ] ) leads to the following alternatives @xcite : @xmath19 note that the non - vanishing of the pion decay constant in the chiral limit means that the generator of the axial symmetry @xmath20 does not annihilate the vacuum but rather produces a massless pion from the vacuum state .",
    "thus , the vacuum is not invariant under chiral transformations , and chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "if no spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry occurs , then in the chiral limit the pion behaves the same way as the excited pseudoscalars : it stays massive and its decay constant vanishes @xcite . the divergence equation ( [ div ] )",
    "leads to the following relation between the couplings : @xmath21 for the pion , by virtue of the gell - mann  oakes  renner ( gmor ) formula @xcite @xmath22 we obtain @xmath23",
    "in this section we construct the full axial current of the constituent quarks by summing soft interactions among the latter .",
    "we show that the current obtained by this procedure is conserved if the spectrum of the pseudoscalar @xmath2 bound states contains a massless state .",
    "let us start with a discussion of the amplitude of the constituent @xmath11 interaction .",
    "we are interested in the region of small invariant mass of the @xmath11 pair , and we want to take into account only two - particle intermediate @xmath11 states . in the region of small invariant mass of the @xmath2 pair , the @xmath24 partial s - wave @xmath11 amplitude , @xmath25 , which satisfies the two - particle unitarity condition ,",

    "this simple ansatz clearly has a limited applicability : namely , it is suitable only for the low - energy region and leads to the appearance of only one  lowest - mass  @xmath2 bound state .",
    "nevertheless , the amplitudes of the interaction of this bound state with the external currents , obtained with the nonlocal separable vertex ( [ 1.4 ] ) , satisfy rigorous requirements of gauge invariance and analyticity .",

    "the interaction of the constituent quarks with gluons is constructed through their covariant derivatives , and the constituent - quark currents satisfy the following divergence equation : @xmath38 therefore , the partially conserved axial current of the constituent quarks , similar to the case of the axial current of the nucleon , should contain not only the @xmath39 structure but also the induced pseudoscalar term @xmath40 : @xmath41 in the chiral limit the conservation of the current ( [ 1.6a ] ) leads to the relation @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the form factor @xmath43 contains a pole at @xmath44 if @xmath45 .",
    "we shall see that the pseudoscalar term in the full axial current of the constituent quark emerges after taking into account the soft interactions of the constituent quarks described by the amplitude ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we shall see that this term contains a pole at @xmath46 and that the axial current ( [ 1.6a ] ) is conserved in the chiral limit .",
    "we start with the axial - vector structure of the constituent - quark current ( the noether current obtained from the lagrangian of the constituent quark model ) , which we refer to as the bare current : @xmath47 as known from the application of the constituent quark model to light mesons and baryons @xcite , the coupling @xmath48 is a slowly varying function of @xmath49 , and the `` on - shell '' axial coupling of the constituent quark is close to unity , @xmath50 @xcite .    let us take into account the soft interactions generated by the vertex ( [ 1.4 ] ) channel also contribute to the full axial current .",

    "<S> we construct the full axial current of the constituent quarks by a summation of the infinite number of diagrams describing constituent - quark soft interactions . by requiring that the conservation of this current is violated only by terms of order @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the mass of the lowest pseudoscalar @xmath2 bound state , we derive important constraints on ( i ) the axial coupling @xmath3 of the constituent quark and ( ii ) the @xmath2 potential at large distances . </S>",
    "<S> we define the chiral point of the constituent quark model as those values of the parameters , such as the masses of the constituent quarks and the couplings in the @xmath2 potential , for which @xmath1 vanishes . at the chiral point </S>",
    "<S> the main signatures of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry are shown to be present , namely : the axial current of the constituent quarks is conserved , the leptonic decay constants of the excited pseudoscalar bound states vanish , and the pion decay constant has a nonzero value . </S>"
