    "turbulent magnetic fields play an important role in many astrophysical processes such as amplification of magnetic fields , accretion , viscous heating and thermal conduction in a turbulent magnetised plasma , etc . @xcite .",
    "one of the most important processes where the presence of turbulent magnetic fields is necessary is the diffusive shock acceleration . in particular ,",
    "the collisionless shock waves themselves are generated via magnetic turbulence , which mediates interactions between particles . in the acceleration process",
    "the turbulence is required to trap accelerated particles around shock front for successive crossings , in which they gain energy .",
    "the acceleration of the particles is accompanied by their radiation .",
    "the character of the radiation can reveal details of the acceleration as well as the properties of the turbulent medium where the acceleration occurs .",
    "the geometry and the scale of turbulence could be reflected in the polarization properties of the radiation .",
    "a completely isotropic turbulence does not produce any net polarization .",
    "however , if the scale of the turbulence is sufficiently large one can detect the fluctuations of the polarization and study the structure of the magnetic field @xcite . in the case of small - scale turbulence , the only way to observe a polarised radiation is the specific anisotropic geometry of the turbulent magnetic field .",
    "this concerns , for example , the objects like grbs .    the turbulent magnetic fields in the shock waves can be generated by a variety of plasma instabilities @xcite .",
    "particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations show that a weibel instability is a key component for generation of the relativistic collisionless shock waves and amplification of magnetic fields @xcite . as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of the magnetic field amplification in grbs , the anisotropy of colliding beams is transferred to the energy of the small - scale turbulent magnetic field .",
    "the characteristic scale of the turbulence is of the order of the plasma skin - depth .",
    "here it is interesting to note that the amplification occurs predominantly for the components of the field which are perpendicular to the direction of beams . the analysis of pic simulations conducted in ref .",
    "@xcite reveals also a significant anisotropy of the turbulence at the saturation stage of amplification .",
    "however , the turbulence becomes more isotropic in a course of non - linear evolution far behind the shock front @xcite .",
    "the radiation of electrons in the small - scale magnetic fields significantly differs from the regular synchrotron radiation @xcite . because of the turbulence",
    ", the formation length of the radiation can be smaller than the formation length required for synchrotron radiation . in this case the qualitatively different type of radiation - jitter radiation - appears .",
    "the conditions for realization of this regime of radiation is the smallness of the characteristic length of the turbulence @xmath0 compared to the _ non - relativistic _ larmor radius @xmath1 .",
    "thus the appearance of the jitter radiation is determined solely by the properties of the magnetic field . because of smaller formation length , the characteristic frequency of jitter radiation @xmath2 is larger than the characteristic frequency of synchrotron radiation @xmath3 by the factor @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "the mechanism of jitter radiation has been revisited in ref .",
    "it has been shown that the power spectrum of radiation behaves as a constant at frequencies smaller than the characteristic frequency of jitter radiation , contrary to the earlier claimed @xmath7 behaviour @xcite .",
    "the spectrum at high frequencies is a power - law with index determined by the turbulent spectrum .",
    "the total power of the jitter radiation equals the total power of the synchrotron radiation in the isotropic magnetic field .",
    "thus presence of the small - scale turbulence affects the radiation spectrum but does not touch total losses . in this paper",
    "we show that a similar relation occurs for polarisation properties : the turbulence influences only the spectral degree of polarisation whereas the degree of polarisation of total radiation is the same for jitter and synchrotron radiations .    concerning the polarisation of radiation from grbs ,",
    "the synchrotron radiation is assumed to be the main mechanism for the production of polarised emission .",
    "while the weibel instability seems to be inevitable in generation of inner and outer shocks , it is not clear whether the weibel instability indeed produces small enough turbulence for the operation of the jitter regime .",
    "the simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite show that the jitter radiation regime can operate during the growing stage while the current filaments merge , and , at the later times , after reaching the non - linear regime when magnetic field starts to decay .",
    "while the growth of the magnetic field occurs very fast , the decaying stage looks more promising for production of significant portion of jitter radiation . at the saturation stage",
    ", it is more probable that the synchrotron regime is at work .",
    "so it makes a sense to consider the polarisation properties of both synchrotron and jitter regimes for a specific configuration of the turbulent magnetic field generated by weibel instability .",
    "the polarisation properties of the radiation in the turbulent magnetic field with the so - called slab geometry have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . assuming an independence of the radiation from different parts of the emitting region , laing @xcite has averaged the radiation from power - law electron distribution over the isotropically distributed directions of the magnetic field in the plane .",
    "while this approach works for synchrotron radiation , the calculations in the case of jitter radiation should take into account the coherence of the turbulent magnetic field .",
    "this has not been done in the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite where the polarisation of jitter radiation has been studied in the manner of ref .",
    "it has led them to incorrect the conclusion that jitter radiation can give a @xmath8 polarisation .",
    "in this paper we study the polarisation properties of the radiation from isotropically distributed electrons in a turbulent magnetic field with slab geometry .",
    "the calculations have been conducted in the general tensor form which is not attached to any specific coordinate system and allows us to avoid any assumptions about principle axis of the polarisation ellipse .",
    "for calculations we follow the approach proposed in ref .",
    "the averaging of the obtained formulae for jitter radiation over all directions of observation reproduces the results obtained for the isotropic turbulence considered in ref .",
    "the derived formulae can be used for an arbitrary energy distribution of electrons .",
    "we compare the polarisation properties of the synchrotron and jitter radiation and show that the synchrotron radiation is more polarised in the case of monoenergetic distributions . for the power - law distribution of electrons the analytical formula for the degree of polarisation of jitter radiation",
    "is obtained .",
    "the paper has the following structure . sections 2 and 3 describe the calculations of the polarization produced in the jitter and synchrotron radiation regimes , respectively . in the section 4 we present the results and compare two cases .",
    "finally , in section 5 we discuss the main results and make conclusions .",
