    "the inner few hundred pc of the galactic bulge ( the inner bulge ) contains stars of a variety of ages , in addition to an apparently coeval population of galactic - age stars .",
    "the evidence for recent massive star formation there has grown with the observations of several clusters of emission - line stars in that region .",
    "intermediate - age stars have also been observed in the inner bulge in the form of oh / ir stars ( lindqvist , habing , & winnberg 1992 ; sjouwerman et al .",
    "1998 ) . noting the presence of these young and intermediate - age stars , serabyn & morris ( 1995 ) argued that star formation in the central molecular zone occupying the inner bulge has been sustained over the lifetime of the galaxy in spite of the inhospitality of that environment for star formation , owing to large gas temperatures and turbulent velocities , strong magnetic fields , and strong tidal forces .",
    "about half a dozen distinct sites of recent star formation have been found in the inner bulge , most notably including the  arches cluster \" ( g0.121 + 0.017 ; nagata et al .",
    "1995 ; cotera et al . 1996 ; serabyn , shupe , & figer 1998 ) and the  quintuplet cluster \" ( afgl2004 ; okuda et al .",
    "1990 ; nagata et al .",
    "1990 ; glass , moneti , & moorwood 1990 ; figer , mclean , & morris 1995 , 1999 ) , both lying within @xmath5  pc , in projection , of the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "these clusters are very young ( @xmath0  myr ) , and compact ( @xmath1  pc ) , while they appear to be as massive as the smallest galactic globular clusters ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "their young ages are manifested by the presence of ample massive stars : the arches and quintuplet contain about 120 and 30 stars having initial mass larger than @xmath7 , respectively ( serabyn et al .",
    "1998 ; figer et al .",
    "morris ( 1993 ) suggested that the non - standard star formation environment near the gc may lead to an initial mass function ( imf ) skewed toward relatively massive stars ( flatter imf ) and having an elevated mass cutoff .",
    "however , the observational limit for the lowest mass in these clusters is still as high as several @xmath8 , so not much is known about the lower end of their mass function .",
    "the arches and quintuplet clusters are two members of what appears to be a special category of clusters ; indeed , their large masses place them at the lower end of the category of super star clusters ( e.g. , ho & filippenko 1996 ) .",
    "another known , potential member of this category near the gc is the young cluster in the central parsec , but because of its unusual location at the bottom of the galactic gravitational potential well , and in the immediate vicinity of the central supermassive black hole , it may have had quite a different origin .",
    "thus , it is not clear that this cluster should be categorized alongside the arches and quintuplet , even though it has a comparable mass ( figer et al .",
    "1999 ) . in any case",
    ", the calculations presented in this paper do not apply to the central cluster .",
    "the stellar cluster in sgr b2 is potentially another supercluster currently in formation ( e.g. , gaume et al . 1995 ) , although it is not yet clear whether it will attain the status of the two more evolved clusters .    with the observations of these compact , young clusters ( cycs ) near the gc , a natural question arises : why do nt we observe older examples of cycs ?",
    "are we witnessing very unusual events that happened to have recently taken place in the gc , or are older clusters rare because they evaporate in a relatively short period of time ?",
    "the proximity of the cycs to the gc implies a strong tidal field , and the short relaxation time due to their compactness makes very massive stars play an important dynamical role through mass segregation , which accelerates the dynamical evolution even more , before these stars disappear with mass loss and explosions .",
    "these two characteristics suggest fairly short lifetimes for the cycs .",
    "the ages of the arches and quintuplet clusters are estimated to differ by about a factor of two , providing an excellent opportunity to compare observations with the numerical study of their dynamical evolution .",
    "because their rather extreme parameters have only recently been recognized , these clusters have not yet been numerically and theoretically explored . in the present study",
    ", we investigate the clusters lifetime , @xmath9 , for various parameters plausible for cycs , and compare the results with current observations of cycs and with estimates of the star formation rate in the inner bulge .",
    "a discussion of the time scales related to the dynamical evolution of spherical stellar systems and on our choice of simulation methods is given in ",
    "[ sec : backgrounds ] .",
    "we describe the details of our models in   [ sec : models ] , and show the simulation results in   [ sec : results ] .",
    "the implications of our results are discussed in   [",
    "sec : discussion ] , and ",
    "[ sec : summary ] summarizes our findings .",
    "the dynamical evolution of stellar systems is affected by many factors such as galactic tidal fields , the stellar mass function , and stellar evolution , as well as their overall mass and physical extent . in general",
    ", a cluster loses its mass by two - body relaxation and stellar evolution ( via supernovae and stellar winds ) , and the resulting dynamical evolution of the cluster is accelerated by the presence of a strong tidal field .    the evolution of star clusters in a static tidal field has been studied extensively .",
    "hnon ( 1961 ) obtained a self - similar solution for an expanding cluster assuming that there is a central energy source ( which he speculated to be binaries ) .",
    "such a cluster is found to evaporate completely in 22.5 times the half - mass relaxation time , which is defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total mass of the cluster , @xmath12 the half - mass radius , @xmath13 the mean mass of each star , and @xmath14 the gravitational constant .",
    "the @xmath15 term appears because of the finite size of the cluster , and is called the coulomb logarithm .",
    "the numerical integration of the fokker - planck equation by lee & ostriker ( 1987 ) confirmed hnon s general result .",
    "these works have been extended to multi - mass models for typical globular cluster parameters by lee , fahlman , & richer ( 1991 ) and lee & goodman ( 1995 ) , and the lifetimes of the clusters in units of half - mass relaxation time have been found to be shorter than those of single mass models by about a significant factor .",
    "thus , clusters with a realistic mass function would survive less than 10 @xmath16 .",
    "the evaporation of stars from the cluster is due to relaxation , but it takes some time for a star to escape from the cluster .",
    "since this  lingering time \" is of order of an orbital period of the star , the evaporation of a cluster depends on both relaxation time and dynamical time .",
    "the average orbital time scale for stars in the cluster can be expressed as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the tidal radius of the cluster , @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the galactocentric radius , and @xmath21 the enclosed galactic mass within @xmath20 .",
    "equations ( [ trh ] ) and ( [ td ] ) give a relation @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the number of stars .",
    "thus the evaporation depends more sensitively on @xmath23 when @xmath23 is small . note",
    "that since @xmath21 is a function of @xmath20 ( see eq . [ [ mg ] ] ) , equations ( [ td ] ) and ( [ rt ] ) imply that @xmath24 can be expressed in terms of @xmath20 only .",
    "stellar evolution affects a cluster s dynamical evolution in several ways .",
    "first , mass loss by stellar evolution ( through stellar winds and explosions ) itself accelerates the mass loss of a cluster and thus shortens the cluster s lifetime .",
    "furthermore , the mass loss by stellar evolution , together with tidal evaporation , may prevent the core collapse .",
    "since stars bound to a cluster have negative energy and massive stars are predominantly located in the core due to mass segregation , the mass loss from the cluster thus has an indirect heating effect .",
    "the effect of very massive stars may be neglected for globular clusters , which have initial @xmath16 of @xmath25  yr , much longer than evolutionary time scales of high mass stars .",
    "the low mass stars eventually undergo evolution on a much longer time scale , and their effects on dynamics should be very small .",
    "therefore , in old globular clusters , the stellar evolution should have been effective only in the initial phase when the relaxation did not play any role .",
    "the subsequent evolution should have been governed mostly by the relaxation process alone .",
    "thus the study of globular cluster evolution may assume that clusters start with upper mass boundary , @xmath26 , much lower than the real initial value ( for example , for @xmath26 , chernoff & weinberg 1990 adopted @xmath27 with stellar evolution , and lee , fahlman , & richer 1991 adopted @xmath28 without stellar evolution ) .",
    "however , the sizes of cycs near the gc are very small for their masses , leading to initial @xmath16 as short as @xmath29  yr .",
    "moreover , the mass segregation time , @xmath30 , may be even shorter than the lifetime of the most massive star .",
    "then very massive stars play an important role in the evolution of the cluster through rapid mass segregation and subsequent demise .",
    "to summarize , the dynamical evolution of a cluster is determined by relative differences between time scales for the above processes , two - body relaxation including core collapse and subsequent expansion , tidal evaporation , stellar evolution , and mass segregation . for example , stellar evolution determines the cluster evolution time scale when the chemical evolution of massive stars occurs much faster than the relaxation time scale of the cluster , and the relaxation governs the cluster evolution when its time scale is shorter than that of stellar evolution . also , if a cluster has a large stellar mass range , the segregation of massive stars toward the central parts shortens the relaxation time in the core and makes relaxation processes more important .",
    "finally , a strong tidal field accelerates all these processes .",
    "since the time scales of these processes scale with cluster parameters in different ways , scaling the evolutionary route of one cluster to another is quite limited , and numerical simulations are generally required for the unexplored parameter regime .      for the study of dynamical evolution of spherical stellar systems , n - body and fokker - planck simulations are among the most widely used methods .",
    "the n - body method is certainly more realistic and requires less assumptions than other methods , but real - number n - body simulations for cycs having @xmath31 are still prohibitively expensive in terms of computing time , especially in the context of a simulation survey in which a range of parameters is being explored .",
    "many studies based on the n - body method use a time - scaling technique to simulate a large - number system with a smaller number of stars on behalf of computing cost .",
    "however , correct scaling is not always guaranteed when the stellar evolution time scale , @xmath32 , is not well separated from @xmath24 and @xmath16 , as might be the case of cycs ( see , however , aarseth & heggie 1998 for a compromise technique , `` variable scaling '' ) .",
    "also , as mentioned above , the evaporation rate of tidally - limited clusters is a function of both @xmath16 and @xmath24 , which scale differently with @xmath23 and @xmath11 .",
    "thus , direct n - body calculations of the system with a smaller number of stars are not able to correctly mimic the evaporation of the system with a larger n. moreover , when the mass function is steep , the upper mass boundary , @xmath26 , can be a function of the total number of stars in the cluster for statistical reasons ( the more stars , the higher @xmath26 ) .",
    "then the system with a smaller number could not properly represent the full mass range of the larger system .    on the other hand , although the fokker - planck method requires more assumptions and approximations , it is much less expensive and gives statistically correct results .",
    "these features are critically beneficial , not only when the study is meant for a parameter survey , but also when statistically stable results without random noise are necessary for theoretical analyses . for these reasons , as a first step of our study of the fate of cycs",
    ", we simulate the dynamical evolution of cycs using fokker - planck models .",
    "we are planning n - body simulations for a few representative cluster parameter sets in a followup study .",
    "a recent comparison between fokker - planck and n - body simulations for tidally - limited clusters showed a discrepancy in cluster lifetime between the two methods ( fukushige & heggie 1995 ; portegies zwart et al .",
    "however , takahashi & portegies zwart ( 1998 ) were able to show that this discrepancy can be successfully removed by adopting anisotropic fokker - planck models with the `` apocenter criterion '' and an appropriate constant for the speed of star removal behind the tidal radius .",
    "here we adopt anisotropic fokker - planck models and the apocenter criterion as an effort to minimize the possible discrepancy with n - body simulations .",
    "we have used the two - dimensional ( energy - angular momentum space ) , orbit - averaged fokker - planck code by takahashi ( 1997 ) .",
    "the code assumes that star clusters are spherically symmetric and are in dynamical equilibrium .    for our initial models ,",
    "we adopt a multi - mass distribution function composed of single mass king models with equal velocity dispersions .",
    "it is assumed that clusters initially fill the tidal radius and that all stars in the cluster are formed simultaneously at @xmath33 .",
    "the relation between @xmath11 and @xmath18 is determined via equation  ( [ rt ] ) and @xmath34 which was adopted from genzel & townes ( 1987 ) .",
    "primordial binaries are not considered in this study , and the coulomb logarithm is taken as @xmath35 .",
    "heating by binaries formed through three - body processes and tidal - capture processes is included .",
    "for the heating rate per unit volume by three - body binaries , we adopt the formulation by lee et al .",
    "( 1991 ) : @xmath36 where the summation is over all mass components , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the number density and velocity dispersion of component @xmath39 , respectively , and @xmath40 is the mass - weighted , central velocity dispersion . on the other hand , we use a modified version of the tidal - capture binary heating rate per unit volume by lee & ostriker ( 1993 ) : @xmath41 where the summation @xmath39 is only for main - sequence stars , @xmath42 is the mean mass in the center , @xmath43 the tidal - capture cross section , @xmath44 the relative rms velocity between components @xmath39 and @xmath45 , and @xmath46 the central gravitational potential . the fitting formulae of kim & lee ( 1999 ) were adopted for @xmath43 .    the effect of the galactic tidal field is assumed to be constant ( circular orbit around the gc and spherically symmetric potential due to the tidal force ) and is realized by imposing a tidal boundary .",
    "a star is removed if its apocenter distance , @xmath47 , exceeds the tidal radius , @xmath18 ( apocenter criterion ; takahashi , lee , & inagaki 1997 ) .",
    "removal of stars satisfying the apocenter criterion is realized by the formalism of lee & ostriker ( 1987 ) : @xmath48^{1/2 } { 1 \\over 2 \\pi } \\sqrt {                          { 4 \\pi \\over 3 } g \\rho_t},\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the distribution function , @xmath50 the tidal energy , and @xmath51 the mean mass density within the tidal radius .",
    "this formula accounts for the persistence time of an escaping star , and the speed of star removal is determined by a dimensionless constant @xmath52 . following takahashi & portegies zwart ( 1998 ) ,",
    "we have adopted @xmath53 .",
    "the effect of stellar evolution is realized by secularly decreasing the mass of each component .",
    "following chernoff & weinberg ( 1990 ) , the mass of each component is linearly decreased by @xmath54 { ( t- \\tau_{i+{1 \\over 2 } } )                          \\over ( \\tau_{i-{1 \\over 2}}-\\tau_{i+{1 \\over 2 } } ) }              \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\hfill { \\rm for}\\;\\;\\ ; \\tau_{i+{1 \\over 2 } } < t <                          \\tau_{i-{1 \\over 2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the mass of component @xmath39 at time @xmath56 , @xmath57 the final mass of the component , @xmath58 the lifetime of a star with mass @xmath59 ( see below for @xmath59 ) . for @xmath60 , @xmath55 has a constant value of @xmath61 , and for @xmath62 , @xmath55 is set to @xmath57 . for intermediate and low mass stars",
    ", the mass evolution between the main - sequence and degenerate stage is so abrupt that it can be approximated with a step function .",
    "however , in case of massive stars ( @xmath63 ) , the mass evolution is continuous throughout the stellar lifetime , so it is quite difficult to define the time for which a star maintains its initial mass and after which the star becomes degenerate .",
    "furthermore , it is not trivial to implement such continuous mass loss into a mass component which is a representation of a set of stars with a certain range of masses and mass loss rates . for this reason , here we define an `` effective lifetime '' of a star such that @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the mass evolution of a star with initial mass @xmath66 , @xmath67 is the time required for the mass of a star with initial mass @xmath66 to become the final mass @xmath68 .",
    "we have adopted schaller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for @xmath65 and @xmath67 , and drukier ( 1995 ) for @xmath68 .",
    "figure [ fig : eff ] is a plot of @xmath69 as a function of @xmath66 obtained in this way .",
    "then this @xmath69 is used for @xmath58 in equation  ( [ mevol ] ) .",
    "the mass spectrum is represented by a set of discrete mass components . for the mass binning",
    ", equal logarithmic space binning has been used in many previous studies .",
    "however , the same logarithmic binning is not appropriate for representing largely different mass spectrum slopes at the same time . in particular",
    ", the logarithmic binning may result in too small number of stars for the most massive bins of a cluster with steep mass spectrum and/or with small @xmath11 , which is not desirable for fokker - planck models .",
    "one could lower the upper mass boundary in accordance with the cluster parameters to avoid such a problem , but then the problem becomes how one `` decides '' the upper mass boundary .",
    "generally , one is interested in a cluster with given @xmath11 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 . in cases where the relaxation time of a cluster is much longer than the stellar evolution time for massive stars , the effect of those massive stars on the dynamical evolution of the cluster",
    "may be neglected and the choice of @xmath26 is relatively unimportant . however , in case of our target clusters , the role of massive stars is expected to be important because of their short relaxation times , and thus @xmath26 should be chosen carefully .",
    "for this reason , we bin the mass in a way that guarantees all mass components to have the number of stars larger than a certain minimum value .",
    "the mass range is binned to make all components have equal value of @xmath72 where [ @xmath73,@xmath74 is the mass range of a component @xmath39 .",
    "thus the mass ranges of each component differ for models with different parameters . for a given @xmath11 , @xmath26 , @xmath71 , @xmath70 , and @xmath75 ( number of bins )",
    ", one can determine the value of @xmath76 that assigns a stellar number of @xmath77 to the most massive bin .",
    "once @xmath76 is determined , @xmath59 is obtained by equation  ( [ mboundary ] ) with given @xmath71 and @xmath26 .",
    "here we adopted @xmath78 , @xmath79 ,  @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 . in this way",
    ", the effects of the most massive stars can be realized in fokker - planck models correctly and consistently .",
    "note that @xmath83 is for equal mass binning , and @xmath84 is for equal number binning .",
    "we choose the initial mass spectrum to be a simple power law @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the initial number of stars with masses between @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and @xmath89 gives a salpeter initial mass function .",
    "the initial mass of component @xmath39 , @xmath61 , is calculated by @xmath90 and the initial total mass of component @xmath39 is @xmath91 the number of stars in component @xmath39 , @xmath92 , is then defined to be @xmath93 . in table [ table : runs ] , @xmath76 and the initial mass of the most massive component , @xmath94 , are given for all models .",
    "note that @xmath76 and @xmath95 are determined by @xmath11 , @xmath71 , and @xmath70 because we fix @xmath26 , @xmath75 , and @xmath77 .",
    "an example of the cluster evolution in our models is shown in figure  [ fig : evol ] .",
    "a mild core collapse takes place at @xmath96  myr , and the postcollapse expansion is accelerated by indirect heating due to stellar evolution starting from @xmath97  myr , which is clearly manifested by a rather abrupt change in @xmath18 slope .",
    "the mildness of the core collapse is only an apparent phenomenon : the relative increase of @xmath98 during the collapse becomes larger when @xmath98 is plotted for only the most massive component .",
    "while the core collapse and postcollapse expansion time scales are determined by the size , structure , and mass function of the cluster , the stellar evolution time scale is dependent only on the mass function .",
    "since these time scales are comparable for most of our models , the lifetime of a cluster will be determined jointly by these time scales in a complex way . in this section , we discuss the effect of each cluster parameter on the evolution of the cluster .",
    "we pay special attention to @xmath9 , which is given in table  [ table : runs ] , since this is closely related to the fate of the cluster .",
    "most of the discussion of evaporation and dynamical evolution assumes that the time is expressed in units of relaxation time . that is useful if the relevant process is related mostly to the two - body relaxation time",
    "however , the stellar evolution is important in the situation that we are considering here , as discussed in   [ sec : timescales ] .",
    "therefore , it is more convenient to express the results in absolute time for the cycs .",
    "king models , which we use as initial models , are a one - parameter family , whose parameter @xmath99 determines the initial degree of central concentration ( the larger the value of @xmath99 , the higher the concentration ) .",
    "figure [ fig : w0 ] shows the evolution of models 101 , 111 , and 112 , which have the same initial conditions except for @xmath99 .",
    "while the times to total evaporation @xmath9 are almost the same , the epochs of the central density peak for these three models are largely different .",
    "the time to core collapse , @xmath100 , is determined by the central relaxation time , @xmath101 , which is smaller for more concentrated clusters , while the tidal evaporation rate is determined by a cluster s global properties .",
    "clusters slowly expand in the postcollapse phase , and this expansion accelerates the tidal evaporation .",
    "the evaporation times are nearly the same for these models because we required our models to have the same @xmath24 ( the same @xmath20 ) , @xmath11 , and @xmath18 .",
    "the evaporation is not sensitive to the detailed structure of the cluster , but depends mainly on macroscopic parameters such as @xmath11 and @xmath102 .",
    "thus the insensitivity of @xmath9 on @xmath99 will hold for the parameter regime covered by our other models as well .",
    "the evolution of the central parameters depends on @xmath99 just because the core collapse is determined by the local conditions in the center , which depend on the initial models .",
    "the effects of lower and upper mass boundaries on @xmath9 might be seen by comparing models 101 , 102 , and 103 .",
    "one may expect that @xmath71 is more important in determining @xmath9 than @xmath26 because @xmath103 varies more with @xmath71 than @xmath26 for our @xmath70 values .",
    "however , interestingly , the results of models 101 to 103 show the opposite behavior : @xmath9 is approximately proportional to @xmath104 , but is almost insensitive to @xmath71 ( see next subsection for the relation between @xmath9 and @xmath95 ) .",
    "generally , a cluster with a mass spectrum rearranges itself so that heavies dominate the central region of the cluster and lights the outer region in a time scale @xmath105 ( @xmath106 in our case ; @xmath95 better represents the upper mass boundary than @xmath26 does because @xmath95 accounts for the mass spectrum ; see  [ sec : models ] ) .",
    "however , the mass ranges of the above models are so wide ( thus the ratios @xmath107 are large ) that even the outer region is dominated by heavies .",
    "this can be clearly seen in the density profile plot ( figure [ fig : prof ] ) , where heavier components are dominant throughout most of the cluster .",
    "this presumably results from the selective evaporation of lighter components due to equipartition .",
    "however , the dominance of heavies in the outer region does not solely explain the similar @xmath9 of models 101 and 102 because the masses of the light components of these models are largely different and may contribute to @xmath16 in dissimilar ways .",
    "the postcollapse density profiles are not far from the profile at the end of the collapse , and the latter may be described by the empirical relations :    [ collapse ] @xmath108    where subscripts @xmath39 and @xmath109 are for the @xmath39th component and the most massive component , respectively , @xmath110 is the beta function , and @xmath111 the central potential ( bahcall & wolf 1977 , cohn 1985 ) .",
    "the above relation stems from @xmath112 , which is an approximate distribution function that a cluster has during the collapse .",
    "cohn found that @xmath113 .",
    "equations ( [ collapse1 ] ) and ( [ collapse2 ] ) give nearly the same profiles for @xmath114 , which is seen also in figure [ fig : prof ] .",
    "thus when a cluster has a wide mass range , its outer region is dominated by heavier components , and @xmath16 is not dependent on @xmath71 as long as @xmath115 ( @xmath116 in our case ) .",
    "such insensitivity of @xmath16 to @xmath71 is also seen between models 113 & 115 ( smaller @xmath70 ) , models 111 & 117 ( smaller @xmath99 ) , models 112 & 118 ( larger @xmath99 ) , models 125 & 129 ( smaller @xmath11 ) , and models 122 & 127 ( larger @xmath11 ) . on the other hand , @xmath9 s of models with @xmath117",
    "do depend on @xmath71 , especially for @xmath118 ( see figure  [ fig : ml ] ) .",
    "this is because their mass ranges [ @xmath71 , @xmath95 ] are not wide enough .",
    "we discuss the effect of @xmath70 on @xmath9 in terms of @xmath95 ( recall that @xmath95 is a function of @xmath70 ) .",
    "models 113 , 101 , 142 , and 114 have the same @xmath11 ( @xmath120 ) but different @xmath70 values . as noted above",
    ", @xmath9 is inversely proportional to @xmath95 ( see figure [ fig : alpha ] ) because of the predominance of heavier components in determining @xmath16 after rapid mass segregation .",
    "models 124 , 125 , 141 , and 126 ( @xmath118 ) show the same proportionality too .",
    "models 121 , 122 , 143 , and 123 ( @xmath121 ; different @xmath70 ) do not exactly follow the @xmath122 relation ( although there is still a clear inverse relation between @xmath9 and @xmath95 ) . as a cluster s",
    "mass becomes larger , its lifetime and @xmath95 increase , and therefore the stellar evolution timescale is a relatively smaller fraction of the cluster s lifetime , and the relative amount of mass that is subject to loss by stellar evolution before cluster evaporation becomes larger .",
    "since the relative amount of mass that is subject to loss by stellar evolution in a given period is a function of @xmath70 , @xmath9 is not simply proportional to @xmath104 for the more massive clusters in which the stellar evolution effect is not negligible .      without stellar evolution",

    "our @xmath9 survey results show that for our parameter regime , cycs will evaporate in less than or about 10  myr , except for some cases with @xmath121 _ and _ @xmath117 .",
    "the compactness of cycs , strong tidal fields , and large stellar mass ranges are jointly responsible for the short lifetimes of cycs , but among these , the strong tidal fields play the most important role .",
    "figure [ fig : tidal ] compares the evolution of model 142 with a model which is the same in every respect , except that @xmath18 is ten times larger ( because the density profile is the same as in model 142 , the cluster does not initially fill up the tidal radius in this case ) . here",
    ", the effect of the tidal field is dramatically illustrated : when cycs are located in tidal fields much weaker than in the gc , their lifetimes are several orders of magnitude longer .",
    "this could be the case for the r136 cluster in the lmc , which has cluster parameters similar to those of cycs , but is apparently subjected to a much weaker tidal field .      of the arches and quintuplet clusters , the former is significantly more compact , and is estimated to be younger and more massive ( see table [ table : clusters ] ) .",
    "the smaller central density of the quintuplet may be due to an initial condition with lower concentration or smaller @xmath11 than that of the arches .",
    "however , because their ages are probably quite different , it is interesting to suppose that the two clusters had the same initial conditions and to see if they represent two distinct epochs in the evolutionary track of a cluster . since the arches is estimated to have @xmath130-@xmath131 and @xmath132  pc , our models with @xmath133 and @xmath134  pc can be considered to represent these clusters .",
    "figure [ fig : evol ] shows the evolution of model 142 , whose parameters are @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 . by comparison with the locations of the clusters in this diagram , we infer that the arches is located near the epoch of core collapse , and the quintuplet is near the end of the evolution .",
    "figure [ fig : evol ] lends plausibility to the idea that the two clusters started with the same initial conditions and that their largely different central densities are simply due to the age difference .",
    "the two clusters may equally well be represented as different evolutionary stages of other model clusters having different values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "model 114 , which has the same parameters as model 142 except for @xmath140 , gives an evolutionary route similar to that of model 142 , with a slightly longer @xmath9 .",
    "meanwhile , smaller @xmath70 values result in shorter @xmath9 , and smaller @xmath71 values give longer @xmath9 .",
    "thus clusters with an appropriate combination of smaller @xmath70 and @xmath71 will also be able to describe the two clusters together .",
    "the mass function evolves due to mass segregation , selective ejection of lighter stars , and stellar evolution .",
    "furthermore , the mass function varies with distance from the cluster center .",
    "thus observations of the mass functions at several different radii , along with a determination of the cluster age , would all be needed to infer the cluster imf . to illustrate this point , we present in figure [ fig : mf ]",
    "the evolution of @xmath70 for the whole cluster and for four equally - spaced annuli of model 142 . considering the observational inaccessibility of low mass stars , and the rapid evolution of massive stars ,",
    "the determination of @xmath70 was restricted to the mass range [ 3 ,  30]@xmath141 .",
    "while the whole cluster mass function evolves relatively slowly until before the final disintegration phase , the mass function of each annulus evolves rather rapidly from the beginning .",
    "the differences in @xmath70 values between annuli are largest near the core collapse .",
    "the @xmath70 values of the outer annuli initially grow due to mass segregation , and later decrease as the tidal radius shrinks .",
    "mass functions of cycs measured with _ hst _ will soon be reported ( figer et al . 1999 ) , and the radial dependence must clearly be considered .",
    "since the mass function evolves from the very beginning , even the current mass function of the younger cyc , the arches , will somewhat differ from the imf .",
    "the final disintegration of a cluster takes place in a relatively short period of time compared to the cluster s lifetime .",
    "fukushige & heggie ( 1995 ) argue that a cluster finally disrupts by losing equilibrium when @xmath142 exceeds a certain critical value . at this point ,",
    "the central density and velocity dispersion decrease abruptly , as may seen in figure  [ fig : evol ] .",
    "we find that our models have @xmath143 less than or about @xmath144 only during the final disruption phase , before which clusters maintain @xmath143 s larger than or about @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , an observation of @xmath143 for the quintuplet will be able to provide important information on the cluster s position in its evolutionary track .",
    "if the quintuplet is indeed in a disruption phase , @xmath9 values calculated in this study may give a constraint on the initial condition of the cluster : the quintuplet is not likely to initially have @xmath146 if its @xmath71 is as low as @xmath147 , because the quintuplet would not otherwise be in a disruption phase at its supposed current age .",
    "the expected number of observed clusters at a certain epoch in the inner bulge , @xmath148 , is basically a function of @xmath11 , @xmath9 , and the star formation rate ( sfr ) in the region : @xmath149 where @xmath150 is a normalized probability that a cluster is formed with @xmath11 at @xmath20 .",
    "we assume initially that stars are all born in clusters . as shown in figure [ fig : rg ] , @xmath9 should apparently be dependent on both @xmath11 and @xmath20 . thus here",
    "we adopt a simple , order - of - magnitude analysis for the relation between @xmath9 and @xmath148 .",
    "first we split the variables in @xmath9 and @xmath151 .",
    "for the former , we adopt a simple form , @xmath152 the virtue of this approximation is that it , along with variable splitting for @xmath151 , makes equation ( [ nobs1 ] ) independent of @xmath11 , whose distribution is not well known ( in fact , the behaviour of @xmath9 s is better described with @xmath153 rather than @xmath154 , but we choose the latter for simpler estimation ) . for the latter ,",
    "we define @xmath155 , where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are normalized for their variables , and we assume that @xmath157 follows the density profile in the inner bulge @xmath158 : @xmath159 ( @xmath160 is adopted instead of @xmath161 for simplicity ) .",
    "we take [ 0 ,  100 ]  pc for the range of @xmath20 ( the final result is not so sensitive to the choice of this range ) .",
    "then equation ( [ nobs1 ] ) now becomes @xmath162 @xmath148 is then equal to the actual current number of large , distinguishable clusters in the inner bulge , two , if sfr is as low as @xmath163 , a value which happens to be very close to the mass of the two clusters divided by their lifetime , which is a crude estimate of the sfr without any consideration of dependencies on @xmath20 and @xmath11 .",
    "gsten ( 1989 ) estimated the sfr in the inner bulge to be 0.3 - 0.6  @xmath164 from the global production rate of lyman continuum photons , and 0.05  @xmath164 from the luminosity of the discrete far - ir sources measured by odenwald & fazio ( 1984 ) .",
    "gsten s estimates are based on the assumption of a salpeter mass function with @xmath71 of @xmath147 . for a flatter mass function with elevated @xmath71 , his sfr becomes smaller , although still considerably larger than 0.01  @xmath164 .",
    "it thus appears that a considerable fraction of stars in the inner bulge forms outside of clusters , or in much smaller clusters than the arches and quintuplet .",
    "a number of other sites of star formation are known in the gc , but none apparently has a stellar luminosity within an order of magnitude of the arches and quintuplet .",
    "partial surveys have been carried out at near - ir wavelengths to identify other potential clusters near the gc ( catchpole , whitelock , & glass 1990 ; figer 1995 ; philipp et al .",
    "1999 ) , but no others have yet been identified , and it seems likely that if there are any others comparable to the arches or quintuplet , they are highly obscured , even at 2 microns .",
    "we therefore speculate that the circumstances of the formation of these clusters was peculiar in some fundamental way , such as catastrophic formation by extremely strong shocks , or direct collision of two dense molecular clouds .",
    "if so , then young stars near the gc are formed in multiple modes , and one can not ascribe the total star formation rate there to massive clusters alone .",
    "we find that in all of our models , heating by three - body binaries exceeds that by tidal - capture binaries during the core collapse , and that the postcollapse expansion is driven by three - body binaries .",
    "moreover , in most models , the cumulative number of tidal binaries formed is less than unity until the end of evolution .",
    "these numbers are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the number of collisional mergers between stars during the first few myr calculated by portegies zwart et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the r136 cluster in the lmc with initial central mass density similar to our models .",
    "the discrepancy is due to the fact that we did not consider the evolution of massive stars into a giant phase in which the stellar radii are largely increased .",
    "thus our tidal - capture binary formation rates are somewhat underestimated , but since the heating per binary is much larger for three - body binaries , the inclusion of radius evolution into our calculations would not change the overall dynamical evolution of the clusters except only for some cases with considerably large initial central densities and steep imfs ( these conditions are more favorable to tidal - capture binary formation ; see , e.g. , kim , lee , & goodman 1998 ) . in these cases ,",
    "the postcollapse expansion will be driven by tidal - capture binaries and clusters will expand more slowly than the ones driven by three - body binaries .",
    "clusters are subject to dynamical friction as they go through field stars while orbiting around the galaxy center .",
    "the drag by dynamical friction causes the clusters to lose energy and spiral in toward the center , where the tidal field is stronger .",
    "when the field stars have a density distribution @xmath165 , the time required for a cluster initially on a circular orbit to reach the center is given by @xmath166 where @xmath143 is the circular orbital velocity of the cluster and @xmath167 is the coulomb logarithm for the field stars ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "reasonable values for the inner bulge are @xmath168 and @xmath169",
    ". then @xmath170 would be comparable to or smaller than @xmath9 calculated in this study only for clusters with extremely small @xmath20 and/or large @xmath11 .",
    "thus , most cycs will disintegrate through tidal evaporation before a significant orbital decay due to dynamical friction takes place .",
    "we assumed that clusters consist of coevally formed stars and start their main - sequence stages at the beginning of simulations .",
    "however , stars may gravitationally interact with others already from pre - main - sequence or even from accreting protostar stages and these stages may be important to cycs because of their short @xmath9 s .",
    "for very massive stars , the time scale of these stages prior to the main - sequence must be much shorter than @xmath9 s calculated in this study , but it becomes larger than 10  myr for stars lighter than @xmath171 ( bernasconi 1996 ) .",
    "thus if lighter stars systematically form earlier than heavier stars , the dynamical evolution of lighter stars until the formation of heavier stars may become important .",
    "the role of the stages prior to main - sequence on the cluster s lifetime is not clear though , because not much is yet known about the details of cluster formation , such as what fraction of the gas goes into star formation ( star formation efficiency ) , how quickly the gas left over from star formation disappears from the cluster by stellar wind and supernova explosions ( timescale of residual gas expulsion ) , and which gas clumps ( as a function of mass ) contract into stars first and act as discrete gravity sources .",
    "these uncertainties are particularly large for the unusual clusters we are considering here .",
    "these issues are in the arena of n - body simulations and the first two issues were considered by tenorio - tagle et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and goodwin ( 1997a , b ) for young globular clusters .",
    "no observational evidence for the presence of residual gas in the arches and quintuplet has been found yet .",
    "proper inclusion of these effects into early cluster dynamics will be possible only after a significant advance in the study of star formation is achieved .    throughout the calculations , we have set @xmath172 , but this value is arbitrarily chosen .",
    "higher values would give more statistically correct results , but would not represent the whole mass range well .",
    "this is one of the intrinsic limitations with fokker - planck simulations . to see the dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath173",
    ", we performed models 142 and 145 with @xmath174 , and obtained only @xmath175  % larger @xmath9 values .",
    "this implies that the choice of @xmath173 does not significantly alter our general results . on the other hand",
    ", our single - power - law imfs may be too simple to represent realistic imfs .",
    "thus we tried a kroupa imf ( kroupa , tout , & gilmore 1993 ) , which is a three - part power - law with @xmath176 for @xmath177 , 2.2 for @xmath178 , and 1.3 for @xmath179 , for @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 .",
    "we found that the model with a kroupa imf has results similar to those of model 116 , in which the parameters are @xmath183 and @xmath184 . since the kroupa imf was derived for the galactic disk , it may not be applicable to the gc where the star formation environment is largely different from that in the disk , but we believe that even the evolution of a cluster with realistic gc imf can be well approximated with one of our simple power - law imfs .",
    "orbit - averages used in our fokker - planck simulations are valid when @xmath185 .",
    "since @xmath186 , cycs , which have @xmath23 of @xmath187 , apparently satisfy the requirement .",
    "however , the wide mass range of cycs shortens the relaxation time in the core through mass segregation , and the above requirement may not hold in the core for some of our models , especially the ones with the largest mass ranges .",
    "in addition , while the fokker - planck method also assumes @xmath188 , some of our models with large @xmath11 and small @xmath70 may have periods when the assumption is temporarily violated .",
    "the validity of using the fokker - planck method for these marginal situations can be assessed using n - body simulations .",
    "we have investigated the dynamical evolution of cycs near the galactic center with anisotropic fokker - planck models . stellar evolution and heating by three - body and tidal - capture binaries",
    "were included in the calculation , and the apocenter criterion with an appropriate removal speed constant was adopted for the tidal evaporation .",
    "mass bins were chosen depending on cluster parameters to properly account for a relatively small number of most massive stars .",
    "the evolutionary time scales of cycs are fairly short because of their compactness and strong tidal fields . for our parameter regime ( @xmath189 , @xmath190  &  1@xmath141 , @xmath191 , and @xmath192 )",
    ", clusters evaporate in @xmath4  myr except for few clusters with @xmath121 .",
    "core collapse takes place in most clusters , and three - body binaries dominate the heating .    unlike globular clusters , very massive stars in cycs play important roles in dynamics because relaxation and mass segregation times are comparable to or even smaller than those stars lifetimes . rapid mass segregation due to a large difference in upper and lower mass boundaries",
    "accelerates a cluster s evolution even more .",
    "strongly selective ejection of lighter stars makes massive stars dominate even in the outer regions of the cluster and the evolution of such clusters is weakly dependent on the lower mass boundary .",
    "we found that the arches and quintuplet clusters , which have quite different central densities , central concentrations , and ages , may be placed on one evolutionary track . among our cluster models ,",
    "that with @xmath133 , @xmath193  pc , @xmath89 or 2.5 , and @xmath194 gives the evolutionary track that best describes both clusters simultaneously .",
    "the first two parameters are from observational constraints , and an appropriate combination of smaller @xmath70 and @xmath71 can also describe the two clusters together .    the total mass in observed cycs is several @xmath195 and the lifetime of cycs with observed @xmath11 at observed @xmath20 is a few myr .",
    "these numbers result in an inner bulge sfr of @xmath196 .",
    "a more detailed ( but still approximate ) estimate of the sfr with a consideration of distributions in @xmath11 and @xmath20 happens to be similar to this simple estimate .",
    "lyman continuum photons and far - ir observations in the inner bulge region give sfrs of 0.050.5@xmath197 .",
    "we suggest that the mode of formation of cycs is peculiar , likely resulting from strong shocks or collisions of dense molecular clouds .",

    "<S> strongly selective ejection of lighter stars makes massive stars dominate even in the outer regions of the cluster , so the dynamical evolution of those clusters is weakly dependent on the lower mass boundary . the mass bins for fokker - planck simulations were carefully chosen to properly account for a relatively small number of the most massive stars . </S>",
