    "the folding kinetics of the vast majority of small , single domain proteins is remarkably well modeled by a two - state process , where the unfolded state ( u ) and the native fold ( n ) are separated by a high free energy barrier , on the top of which lays the transition state ( ts )  @xcite . due to its transient nature",
    ", the structural characterization of the folding ts represents a particularly challenging task in protein biophysics .",
    "indeed , experimental studies to date have typically relied on the application of a particular class of protein engineering methods , the so - called @xmath0-value analysis , pioneered by fersht and co - workers in the 1980s  @xcite . in the @xmath0-value analysis a mutation",
    "is made at some position in the protein sequence ; the @xmath0-value is obtained by measuring the mutation s effect on the folding rate and stability , namely @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the folding rates of the mutant and wild - type ( wt ) sequences respectively , and @xmath5 is the free energy of folding . for a non - disruptive mutation ( i.e. , a mutation that does not change the structure of the native state , and does not alter the folding pathway either ) , @xmath6 can be approximated by the change in the activation energy of folding upon mutation , @xmath7 , and therefore @xmath8 .",
    "a @xmath0 value of unity means that the energy of the ts is perturbed on mutation by the same amount the native state is perturbed , which has traditionally been taken as evidence that the protein structure is folded at the site of mutation in the ts as much as it is in the native state .",
    "conversely , residues which are unfolded in the ts , as much as they are in the unfolded state , should exhibit @xmath0 values of zero .",
    "the interpretation of a fractional @xmath0 value is , however , not straightforward as it might indicate the existence of multiple folding pathways  @xcite , or it may underlie a unique ts with genuinely weakened interactions  @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation of mutational data has been recently proposed by weikl and co - workers that instead of considering the effect of each individual mutation , collectively considers all mutations within a fold s substructure ( e.g. , a helix ) .",
    "such an interpretation is able to capture the so - called nonclassical @xmath0 values ( @xmath9 0 or @xmath10 ) , and explains how different mutations at a given site can lead to different @xmath0 values  @xcite .    in the case of the 64-residue protein chymotrypsin - inhibitor 2 ( ci2 ) , the extensive use of @xmath0-value analysis revealed only one residue ( ala 16 ) with a distinctively high @xmath11 , whereas the vast majority of ci2 s residues show typically low fractional @xmath0-values  @xcite .",
    "these findings were taken as evidence that ci2 folds via the so - called nucleation - condensation ( nc ) mechanism , with the folding nucleus ( fn ) consisting primarily of the set of bonds ( mostly local but also a few long - range ) established by the residue with the highest @xmath0-value  @xcite , which is identified as a nucleation site .",
    "interestingly , the very first microscopic evidence for the existence of a nucleation mechanism in protein folding was obtained in the scope of monte carlo simulations of a simple lattice model , where shakhnovich and collaborators observed that once the fn , consisting of a specific set of native bonds , is established the native fold is achieved very rapidly  @xcite .",
    "additional studies _ in vitro _",
    "@xcite and _ in silico _",
    "@xcite , using more sophisticated protein models and other simulational methodologies , have provided further evidence for the existence of nucleation sites in ci2 as well as in other target proteins .",
    "for this reason the nucleation mechanism is typically considered the most common folding mechanism amongst small , two - state proteins  @xcite .",
    "a few years ago , snchez and kiefhaber reported a set of experimental data indicative that @xmath0-values are considerably inaccurate unless the difference in the folding free energy upon mutation is larger than 7kj / mol  @xcite .",
    "a refute by fersht followed based on the premise that the 7kj / mol cut - off was based on mutations that are unsuitable for @xmath0-value analysis because they are disruptive  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a collaborative effort between three laboratories in north america investigated the relationship between @xmath0-value reliability and the change in the free energy of folding , @xmath12 , using the generally employed experimental practices and conditions .",
    "a conclusion came out from this study stating that the precision of experimentally determined @xmath0-values is poor unless @xmath13 kcal / mol  @xcite . in a related study , raleigh and",
    "plaxco pointed out that only three out of the 125 more accurately determined @xmath0-values reported in the literature lie above 0.8 , and that about 85% of the mutations characterized for single domain proteins show @xmath0-values below 0.6  @xcite .",
    "overall , these findings have prompted a discussion regarding the existence of specific nucleation sites , and therefore some controversy has been generated regarding the nucleation mechanism of protein folding .",
    "the goal of the present study is to contribute to clarify this controversy by applying two different procedures that identify the nucleating residues in the folding of small lattice proteins .",
    "one of these procedures , a simulational proxy of the @xmath0-value analysis , leads to a supposedly ` inaccurate ' identification of the fn s residues that is made irrespective of the free energy changes caused by mutation .",
    "the other procedure , which is based on the use of the reaction coordinate , @xmath1  @xcite , allows for an accurate / rigorous identification of the ts , and of the native contacts which make up the fn . by comparing the results obtained from both approaches insight",
    "is gained on the suitability of the @xmath0-value analysis as a tool to identify kinetically determinant residues in protein folding , and on the nucleation mechanism of folding .",
    "since native geometry is known to play a major role in the folding kinetics of small two - state proteins  @xcite , we study two model proteins with considerably different native geometries .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the protein models and computational methodologies used in the simulations .",
    "afterwards , we present and discuss the results .",
    "in the last section we draw some concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a simple three - dimensional lattice model of a protein molecule with chain length @xmath14=48 .",
    "in such a minimalist model amino acids , represented by beads of uniform size , occupy the lattice vertices and the peptide bond , which covalently connects amino acids along the polypeptide chain , is represented by sticks with uniform ( unit ) length corresponding to the lattice spacing .    to mimic protein energetics we use the g model  @xcite",
    ". in the g model the energy of a conformation , defined by the set of bead coordinates @xmath15 , is given by the contact hamiltonian @xmath16 where the contact function @xmath17 , is unity only if beads @xmath18 and @xmath19 form a non - covalent native contact ( i.e. , a contact between a pair of beads that is present in the native structure ) and is zero otherwise .",
    "the g potential is based on the principle that the native fold is very well optimized energetically .",
    "accordingly , it ascribes equal stabilizing energies ( e.g. , @xmath20 ) to all the native contacts and neutral energies ( @xmath21 ) to all non - native contacts . in order to mimic the protein s relaxation towards the native state we use a metropolis monte carlo ( mc ) algorithm  @xcite together with the kink - jump move set  @xcite .",
    "a mc simulation starts from a randomly generated unfolded conformation and the folding dynamics is monitored by following the evolution of the fraction of native contacts , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is number of contacts in the native fold and @xmath24 is the number of native contacts formed at each mc step .",
    "the number of mc steps required to fold to the native state ( i.e. , to achieve @xmath25 ) is the first passage time ( fpt ) and the folding time , @xmath26 , is computed as the mean fpt of 100 simulations . except otherwise stated folding",
    "is studied at the so - called optimal folding temperature , the temperature that minimizes the folding time  @xcite .",
    "the folding transition temperature , t@xmath27 , is defined is the temperature at which denatured states and the native state are equally populated at equilibrium . in the context of a lattice model",
    "it can be defined as the temperature at which the average value @xmath28 of the fraction of native contacts is equal to 0.5  @xcite . in order to determine t@xmath29 we averaged @xmath30 , after collapse to the native state , over mc simulations lasting @xmath31 10@xmath32 mcs .",
    "two native folds , which are amongst the ` simplest ' ( geometry 1 ) and the most ` complex ' ( geometry 2 ) cuboid geometries found through lattice simulations of homopolymer relaxation , were considered in this study .",
    "a contact map representation , which emphasizes their distinct geometrical traits , is shown in figure  [ fig : no1 ] .",
    "table  [ table1 ] provides a summary of kinetic and thermodynamic features of both protein models .",
    ".summary kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the protein models considered in this study .",
    "e is the native state s energy , t is the optimal folding temperature and @xmath33 is the logarithmic folding time computed at t. also shown is the folding transition temperature , t@xmath27 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]"
