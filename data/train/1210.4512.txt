    "@xcite attention has also shifted to other non - fe transition metal based chalcogenides as they are shedding light on the road to the _ post - iron age _ in superconductivity .",
    "there are yet no rigorous computational study of the electronic structure of palladium monotelluride ( pdte ) .",
    "so far , experimental studies show that it has a @xmath2 2.3  4.5 k,@xcite , electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath3@xmath4 1.4 , @xcite and a phase diagram reminiscent of the high - pressure diagram of fe chalcogenides ( fech ) .",
    "@xcite compared with fech  @xcite the hexagonal pdte structure ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : pdte_struct](a ) ) can be regarded as the deformed structure of fete ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : pdte_struct](c ) ) obtained by sliding the anion and cation layers . despite such structural similarity , the local ligand field is transformed from a tetrahedral cage surrounding fe to an octahedral cage surrounding pd . with a similar crystal structure but distinct physical properties , pdte",
    "thus serves as a good candidate for comparison to better illuminate the important physical effects and to reveal the building blocks for a stronger superconductivity in the fe chalcogenides .",
    "the positions of the atoms are pd(1 ) : ( 0,0,1/2 ) , pd(2 ) : ( 0,0,0 ) , te(1 ) : ( 1/3,2/3/3/4 ) , and te(2 ) : ( 2/3,1/3,1/4 ) , respectively .",

    "there are six te octahedrally arranged around pd .",
    "( c ) the tetragonal structure of fete along the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "( d ) the local coordinate of pd and te in the pdte system as utilized in the definition of the wannier basis .",
    "the local coordinates corresponding to each of the atoms in the unit cell ( two pd and two te ) have been defined using the x - convention .",
    "( e ) the global coordinate of the pdte system .",
    "the subscripts l and g denote local and global coordinates , respectively . ]",
    "[ fig : pdte_struct ]    motivated by the growing effort to understand properties of nias - like systems due to their very diverse and interesting properties , we provide a first - principles wannier function analysis of the electronic structure of pdte .",
    "we remark that there is no yet ` rigorous ' electronic structure study of the properties of pdte .",
    "a concomitant motivation is the evolving effort to understand the superconductivity mechanism in fe - based superconductors . by comparing the characteristics of pdte with those of fe chalcogenides ,",
    "one expects to identify key ingredients behind the high - temperature superconductivity in fe - based superconductors , a current research topic of general interest to a broad audience .",
    "we find that the face - shared octahedral coordination of pd and the larger size of its 4@xmath0 orbital favor the electronic kinetic energy over the coulomb potential energy . also , a broad three - dimensional fermi surface ( fs ) with a strong variation along the @xmath5 direction , and a lack of orbital degeneracy are observed .",
    "the almost fully occupied pd @xmath0 orbitals lead to a strong covalent pd - te bonding and a vanishing local magnetic moment .",
    "a near octahedral coordination in pdte leads to a large crystal field splitting of the pd-@xmath0 orbitals ( @xmath6  @xmath7 ) with a crystal field parameter of @xmath8 @xmath4 400 mev .",
    "therefore , most probably electronic correlations are suppressed in pure pdte",
    ". one can thus conclude that due to these dilute correlations , pure pdte may just be a low @xmath9 superconductor in basic agreement with the experimental work of karki .",
    "this study illuminates the important underlying physics of the high - tc fe - based superconductors and most especially , reveals the building blocks for a stronger superconductivity in fe chalcogenides .",
    "such a study can help to reassess the rules one uses in the search of a room temperature superconductor and in particular , providing key insights on how to achieve high temperature superconductivity in general .",
    "we use first - principles calculations to study the electronic structure of pdte and the competition between various magnetic configurations .",
    "we utilize standard density functional theory ( dft ) within the general potential linearized augmented planewave ( lapw ) method @xcite and the generalized gradient approximation ( pbe - gga ) functional , @xcite as implemented in wien2k .",
    "@xcite in our computations , we utilize the room temperature experimental lattice parameters : a = b = 4.152  and c = 5.672  , @xcite and the hexagonal crystal structure with space group p6@xmath10/mmc ( patterson symbol ) .",
    "@xcite pd and te atoms occupy @xmath11 and @xmath12 wyckoff positions , respectively , namely , pd(1 ) : ( 0,0,1/2 ) , pd(2 ) : ( 0,0,0 ) ; te(1 ) : ( 1/3,2/3/3/4 ) , and te(2 ) : ( 2/3,1/3,1/4 ) .",
    "@xcite thus , the first - principles ground state can be reached with all the wien2k default settings and a k - mesh of @xmath13 . to downfold the dft electronic band structure , symmetry respecting wannier functions @xcite of pd @xmath0 and te @xmath1",
    "are constructed to capture the low - energy hilbert space within [ -8 , 3 ] ev and obtain an effective tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "we then obtain the band structure and the fermi surface by calculating the orbital - resolved spectral function , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are orbital index , crystal momentum , and energy , respectively .",
    "the structure of pdte is tied strongly to its electronic and magnetic properties , since the spatial extension of the 4@xmath0 orbitals promotes comparable and competing kinetic and coulomb energies .",
    "pdte crystallizes in the nias or d@xmath18 crystal structure , which is of interest both from experimental and theoretical points of view.@xcite transition metal compounds with the nias crystal structure attract special interest due to anomalies in their magnetic , elastic , and electrical properties , especially near phase transitions , the nature of which is still under study.@xcite in pdte the pd atoms sit in an fcc - like environment , while the te atoms form an hcp - like structure and are surrounded by six pd metal atoms forming a trigonal prism .",
    "@xcite in this structure , the pd - centered octahedron shares both edges and faces with the neighboring pdte@xmath19 octahedra ( c.f . fig .",
    "[ fig : pdte_struct ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "this is different from fech or fepn where the corrugated square planes of fe with se ( or as ) atoms are such that fe is tetrahedrally coordinated below and above the planes .",
    "thus , the fe atoms sit in the tetrahedral cavities of the tetragonally distorted close packed lattice of se ( or as).@xcite we also note that the structure of pdte places pd atoms closer to each other than in a perovskite ; as such , direct pd - pd hybridization becomes important as we will discuss below .",
    "our resulting electronic band structure and density of states ( dos ) for non - magnetic pdte are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdte_elect ] , colored to emphasize the pd @xmath6 , @xmath7 and te @xmath1 orbitals .",
    "the whole spectrum is predominantly a single huge band complex due to the strong hybridization between pd @xmath0 and te @xmath1 orbitals .",
    "the role of @xmath20 hybridization in nias - type compounds have been highlighted in literature ( see for e.g. , refs . for discussions ) .",
    "notice from the dos ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : pdte_elect ] ) that almost all the pd @xmath0 orbitals are occupied , and the low energy excitations near the fermi surface are composed mainly of te @xmath1 electrons hybridized with the @xmath7 orbital of pd .",
    "the pd @xmath0 orbital occupancy can be calculated from the trace of the one - particle reduced density matrix on each pd atom ( in wannier function basis ) and is found to be 9.31 , which is very close to the fully occupied value of 10 .",
    "this indicates strong covalency of the pd - te bonding and strong suppression of the spin local moment .",
    "the strong covalency can also be confirmed by measuring the distance @xmath21 between the highest peaks in te 5@xmath1 and pd 4@xmath0 bands which is a measure of the ionicity or covalency of the bonding .",
    "@xmath21 is found to be @xmath22 2.92 a.u .",
    "we find in particular that the electronic structure of pdte is determined by short - range interactions in the te @xmath1 ",
    "pd @xmath0 band complex , with the ligand - field splitting of the pd @xmath0 states in the environment of the te atoms being the key determinant of the structure of the @xmath0 band .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , the fermi surface is presented in various @xmath5 planes . as already seen in the band structure , the states in the proximity of the fermi level consist mainly of te @xmath1 ( green orbital ) weakly hybridized with pd @xmath7 ( red orbital ) , thus appearing dark green .",
    "the fermi energy is located close to the local maxima of the dos , corresponding to n(e@xmath23 ) @xmath22 2.41 a.u .",
    "the corresponding electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath24 is 2.84 mj mol@xmath25 k@xmath26 .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the experimental value of 6.0 mj mol@xmath25 k@xmath26 obtained by karki if we take into account the many - body effect contributions from electron - phonon interactions such that @xmath24 is renormalized as @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 .    to investigate the magnetism of pdte",
    ", we survey various magnetic configurations , including collinear , bicollinear , and checkerboard antiferromagnetism , with spin - polarized calculations .",
    "indeed , the non - polarized case possesses the lowest ground state total energy , so there are no long - range magnetic correlations .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the almost - full - pd-@xmath0 orbitals not only rule out the superexchange mechanism for antiferromagnetic correlations , but also suppress the effectiveness of hund s coupling , and thus ferromagnetic correlations as well .",
    "planes with the same color code as fig .",
    "[ fig : pdte_elect ] .",
    "the value of @xmath5 is in units of @xmath30 .",
    "the states in the proximity of the fermi surface are predominantly te-@xmath1 states , hence the color of the fermi surface plots is mainly green . ]    in order to gain a microscopic insight into the electronic structure of pdte , we transform the self - consistent kohn - sham ( dft ) hamiltonian to wannier basis , as summarized in table  [ table : pdte_ham ] . in the intra - atomic pd block ,",
    "one finds a large ( @xmath4400 mev ) @xmath6-@xmath7 splitting which originated from the octahedral ligand field , with negligible off - diagonal terms associated with the tiny distortion of the octahedral cage . a similar splitting ( @xmath4500mev ) is also found between te @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , we find considerable inter - atomic pd - te and pd - pd hopping , for example , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 mev , which are much larger than the intrinsic scale for the on - site energy difference between pd and te ( @xmath4100 mev ) ( c.f . table  [ table : pdte_ham ] ) . the same hopping value of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , even when they are not symmetry related , is due to the 30@xmath40 tilting angle that is naturally built - in in the crystal symmetry of pdte , as can be understood from the slater - koster coefficients used in the tight - binding model .",
    "@xcite    .(color online ) .",
    "this table is mainly intended to show the hopping dominated physics in pdte and , as such , it represents a reduced matrix of the original 16 by 16 matrix of pd @xmath0 and te @xmath1 states . for clarity , the pd(1 ) @xmath0 and te(1 ) @xmath1 sub - bands are represented using bold letters .",

    "[ fig : pdte_struct](d ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : pdte_ham ]    unconventional superconductivity generally emerges in frustrated systems @xcite when long - range order in the spin , charge or orbital channel is suppressed .",
    "the key ingredients needed for a typical unconventional superconductor , strong short - range correlations in these channels , are either negligible or dilute in pdte .",
    "several factors make pdte very different from fech .",
    "strong hopping due to the more extended 4@xmath0 orbitals , which promotes a larger kinetic energy , closer pd - pd distance in the face - shared pd octahedron environment , negligible hund s moment , weaker magnetic spin fluctuations , lack of orbital degeneracy , strong covalency , and very dilute magnetic frustration .",
    "although pdte has a layered structure similar to the tetragonal fe chalcogenides , its intrinsic pd @xmath56 character and face - shared octahedron environment not only suppress the electronic correlations in the charge , orbital , and spin channels but also promote three dimensionality .",
    "the three dimensionality of pdte electronic structure is made clear from the strong @xmath5 variation of the fermi surface topology in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "such a strong three - dimensionality indicates a much weaker fermi surface nesting , and would likely favor a weaker long - range correlation in the particle - hole ( spin , charge , and orbital ) channel .",
    "in addition , since the charge - transfer energy between pd @xmath0 and chalcogen @xmath1 states is much smaller in pdte than in fech , the pd @xmath0 states are almost fully occupied , and there are no states available to form a large hund s moment , making magnetic correlations and , e.g. , magnetic frustration effects , weaker . therefore , any possibility of magnetically - driven superconductor is suppressed . the relatively low superconducting temperature in pdte",
    "may likely be due to another source , presumably phonons .    as can be seen from table  [ table : pdte_ham ] , the dominant hoppings are those between pd and the neighboring te .",
    "this strong hopping is due to the large orbital overlap between te and pd ions ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : pdte_struct](d ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a strong pd - pd hopping is also observed .",
    "this is due to the spatial extension of the 4@xmath0 orbitals , a consequence of its larger quantum number compared to 3@xmath0 orbitals , that overlap with neighboring pd ions ; and the closer pd - pd distance in the octahedral environment .",
    "since the hybridization matrix between the @xmath0-orbitals scales as d@xmath57 , where d is the bond length , a shorter bond length greatly affects the hybridization between @xmath0-orbitals.@xcite this will increase the kinetic energy , compared to the case of corner - shared and edge - shared octahedrons .",
    "hence , the importance of correlations from direct coulomb interactions will be highly dilute .",
    "also , the lack of orbital degeneracy will eliminate the ferro - orbital correlation and the associated c - type antiferromagnetic order.@xcite    the strong covalency , absence of electronic correlations , lack of orbital degeneracy , and the dilute nature of the magnetic frustration in pdte are in sharp contrast , in particular , to fe chalcogenides , and in general , to fe - based superconductors .",
    "thus , pdte will display dramatically weaker magnetic and superconducting tendencies than the fe - based superconductors .",
    "one may conclude that the key ingredients for a high @xmath9 unconventional superconductivity are lost and pure pdte may just be a low @xmath9 superconductor .",
    "however , interesting magnetic correlation might be reactivated upon fe doping .",
    "we have performed self - consistent dft and downfolding electronic band structure via symmetry respecting wannier functions to study the electronic properties of pdte .",
    "our computations show that there is significant pd-@xmath0 and te-@xmath1 hybridization , larger crystal field splitting of pd d - orbitals due to their near octahedral coordination , and higher filling of the pd @xmath0-shell resulting in weaker magnetic frustration , strong covalency , and lack of orbital degeneracy , which quench ferro - orbital correlations .",
    "the large @xmath5 variation of the fermi surface topology also demonstrates a strong three - dimensional character of the electronic structure .",
    "these features destroy the ingredients needed for pdte to be a high - t@xmath58 unconventional superconductor .",
    "this case study provides a good contrast that highlights some important features ( quasi - two - dimensionality , proximity to half - filling , weaker covalency , and higher orbital degeneracy ) of fe - based high - temperature superconductors .",
