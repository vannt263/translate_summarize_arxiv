    "<S> -5 mm    * vector meson dominance and @xmath9 at finite temperature from qcd sum rules *    @xmath10 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11    [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     one of the popular reactions proposed for probing the quark - gluon plasma is dilepton production in high energy heavy ion collisions @xcite . an important piece of information required to calculate the dilepton production rates , in the hadronic phase , is the temperature variation of the electromagnetic pion form factor , @xmath12 . in these calculations it has been usually assumed that vector meson dominance ( vmd ) remains valid at non - zero temperature and , with a few exceptions @xcite , that the rho - meson mass and width are temperature independent . </S>",
    "<S> it has been argued long ago , though , that all hadronic widths should increase with increasing temperature , and presumably diverge at the critical temperature for deconfinement @xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected to hold also for particles which are ( hadronically ) stable at @xmath13 , e.g. nucleons and pions . </S>",
    "<S> actual calculations in various frameworks do support such a scenario @xcite-@xcite . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , the imaginary part of a hadronic green s function , i.e. the width , may be viewed as a phenomenological signal for the occurrence of deconfinement . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a qcd sum rule determination of the pion form factor at finite temperature clearly shows that it depends on @xmath1 in such a way that it vanishes at the critical temperature , while the pion radius diverges there @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this determination of @xmath14 does not rely on any form of vmd , as it is based on the three - point function associated to the electromagnetic current and two axial - vector currents , thus projecting directly the electromagnetic pion form factor ( in the space - like region @xmath15 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we study finite energy qcd sum rules ( fesr ) at @xmath16 for the three - point function involving the rho - meson interpolating current plus two axial - vector divergences . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to determine the @xmath17- and the @xmath1- dependence of the @xmath2 coupling , as well as to gauge the validity of vmd at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we begin with the determination of @xmath18 at zero temperature ( for an earlier analysis using laplace sum rules see @xcite ) , in order to establish normalizations , as well as to check vmd here . </S>",
    "<S> this can be accomplished by using @xmath18 determined from the sum rules , together with vmd , and comparing the resulting pion form factor with the data . at finite temperature </S>",
    "<S> , we can also compare it with the direct determination @xcite , i.e. with a theoretical result not relying on vmd . </S>",
    "<S> since the latter does fit the data very well at @xmath13 , we can adopt it as the benchmark @xmath14 in the absence of experimental data at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> agreement between the two expressions could be taken as evidence in support of vmd at finite @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider first the @xmath13 correlator @xmath19     & = & \\pi_{1 } ( q^{2 } ) \\ ; p_{\\mu } + \\pi_{2 } ( q^{2 } ) \\ ; q_{\\mu } \\ ; , \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath20:$ ] , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . </S>",

    "<S> the hadronic counterpart of this correlator may be obtained after saturation with the pion intermediate state , and using the current - field identity @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the isospin current , @xmath30 is the rho - meson field , and the experimental value of the coupling is @xmath31 , as obtained from the decay rate of the rho - meson into @xmath32 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the result for the hadronic spectral function , e.g. @xmath33 is @xmath34 & + & \\theta(s - s_{0 } ) \\;\\theta(s ' - s'_{0})\\ ; \\mbox{\\mbox{im } } \\ ; \\pi_{1}(s , s',q^{2 } ) |_{\\mbox{qcd } } \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 mev , and @xmath36 @xcite . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath9 is a form factor , i.e. a function of @xmath0 . in the simpler version of vmd , i.e. single rho - meson dominance , </S>",
    "<S> this coupling would be strictly constant . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are radial excitations of the rho - meson ( the @xmath37(1450 ) , @xmath37(1700 ) , etc . ) which make a non - negligible contribution and turn the coupling into a form factor . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , naive vmd applied to the electromagnetic pion form factor predicts @xmath38 , while the experimental value is 20 % higher . </S>",
    "<S> hadronic models , such as e.g. the dual model @xcite , account for this difference by incorporating the rho - meson radial excitations ; this gives @xmath39 , but @xmath40 , in agreement with experiment . at the same time , naive vmd does not fit the data too well in the space - like region @xcite ; much better fits are obtained by allowing for a @xmath0-dependence of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the pion pole contribution in eq.(4 ) , there are additional terms from the pionic radial excitations , the @xmath41 meson . </S>",
    "<S> etc .. however , we shall include these in the hadronic continuum , which is supposed to be well approximated by the perturbative qcd expression eq.(2 ) , provided that the thresholds @xmath42 .    </S>",
    "<S> at this point one can invoke cauchy s theorem which leads to finite energy sum rules ( fesr ) ; the one of lowest dimension in the present case is    @xmath43    where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , are the continuum thresholds , i.e. the onset of perturbative qcd . </S>",
    "<S> after substitution of the qcd and hadronic spectral functions in the fesr one obtains    @xmath46    where @xmath47    and use was made of the gell - mann , oakes and renner ( gmor ) relation @xcite @xmath48 the result for @xmath49 above was obtained after a double integration in the @xmath50 plane . </S>",
    "<S> the region of integration is a triangle in this plane , but use of other shapes does nt introduce appreciable differences in the numerical results for @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> an advantage of using fesr as opposed to e.g. laplace transform qcd sum rules , is that the latter requires knowledge of the vacuum condensates of all dimensions . in contrast , at most one condensate contributes to a fesr of a given dimension . in the present case , </S>",
    "<S> since the dimension of @xmath51 is @xmath52 , there are no condensates appearing in the lowest dimensional fesr . </S>",
    "<S> invoking now extended vector meson dominance ( evmd ) , i.e. vmd but with allowance for a possible @xmath17-dependence of @xmath53 , leads to a well known expression for the electromagnetic pion form factor    @xmath54    substituting the fesr result eq.(6 ) into eq.(9 ) gives    @xmath55\\;.\\ ] ]    this result can be compared with that based on a three - point function involving the electromagnetic current and two axial - vector currents @xcite , which projects the pion form factor directly , and hence makes no use of vmd , i.e.    @xmath56    although eqs.(10 ) and ( 11 ) look structurally very different , they are numerically very similar for @xmath57 , if @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter value leads to a very good fit of the data above @xmath60 @xcite . on the other hand , with @xmath61 , the extrapolation of eq.(6 ) to @xmath62 gives @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be stressed that the onset of the continuum need not be the same in the two cases , as the correlators are different . </S>",
    "<S> a priori , all one knows is that @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) should roughly be in the region where the resonances loose prominence , and the hadronic continuum takes over , i.e. somewhere in the interval @xmath64 . on the other hand , the extrapolation to @xmath62 of any of the above results should not be taken too seriously , as the operator product expansion , the backbone of qcd sum rules , diverges at the origin . the good numerical agreement between eqs.(10 ) and </S>",
    "<S> ( 11 ) , as shown in fig.1 , may be seen as a reflection of the validity of evmd . in any case </S>",
    "<S> , our main purpose here is not another fit to the data at @xmath13 , but rather the non - zero temperature behaviour of the @xmath65 form factor . </S>",
    "<S> since it is actually the ratio @xmath66 which counts , modestly reasonable @xmath13 results are normally sufficient .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we reconsider the above fesr at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> thermal corrections to @xmath67 can be calculated in the standard fashion @xcite-@xcite , and we find for the imaginary part    @xmath68    where @xmath69    @xmath70    @xmath71    @xmath72 is the fermi thermal factor , and @xmath73 , @xmath74 . on the hadronic side , both @xmath75 and @xmath76 will develop a temperature dependence , and so will @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter follows from the notion that as the resonance peaks in the spectral function become broader , the onset of the continuum should shift towards threshold @xcite , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature behaviour of this asymptotic freedom threshold has been obtained from the lowest dimension fesr associated to the two - point function involving the axial - vector currents @xcite , @xcite , with @xmath77 as a known input ( for a recent updated discussion see @xcite ) . for temperatures not too close to the critical temperature @xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> say @xmath78 , the following scaling relation has been found to hold to a very good approximation @xcite @xmath79 we shall make use of this relation in the sequel , together with the results of @xcite for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , in the chiral limit , as well as for @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we shall invoke the gmor relation at finite @xmath1 , which only gets modified at next to leading order in the quark masses @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath83 0 fesr now reads @xmath84 where @xmath85    and the integration in eq.(18 ) must now be done numerically . </S>",
    "<S> the rho - meson mass was assumed to be temperature independent ; the modest increase of @xmath86 near @xmath6 as obtained from qcd sum rules @xcite , and other methods @xcite , does not change qualitatively the conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the ratio @xmath66 are shown in fig.(2 ) for @xmath80 and @xmath81 in the chiral limit ( curve ( a ) ) , as well as for @xmath82 ( curve(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath87 was used in this figure , higher values of @xmath17 give similar results . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , and importantly , the vanishing of the ratio at or near the critical temperature is basically @xmath17 - independent . </S>",
    "<S> this provides analytical evidence for deconfinement . </S>",
    "<S> the good agreement between the pion form factor using @xmath88 plus vmd and that obtained directly without invoking vmd , persists at @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> an extrapolation of these results to @xmath62 allows for a determination of the @xmath65 root mean squared radius . </S>",
    "<S> although this is divergent at any temperature because of mass singularities , the ratio @xmath90 is well defined ; it increases with increasing @xmath1 until the critical temperature where it becomes infinte , thus signalling deconfinement . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature behaviour of this ratio is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> + to conclude , we obtained direct evidence supporting extended vmd at @xmath13 from a comparison of the @xmath65 vertex function determined from qcd sum rules and the experimental data on the electromagnetic pion form factor . at finite temperature , and in the absence of data , we compared our determination with a benchmark pion form factor obtained from independent qcd sum rules and not using vmd . </S>",
    "<S> the close agreement found between the two expressions may be interpreted as supportive of ( extended ) vmd at @xmath16 . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , our determination provides additional analytical evidence for deconfinement , as @xmath91 decreases with @xmath1 , vanishing at the critical temperature , while the ratio of the @xmath65 root mean square radii @xmath90 increases with temperature and becomes infinite at @xmath8 . + </S>",
