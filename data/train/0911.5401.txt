    "astrophysics and cosmology observations in recent years delineate the cosmological picture on its constituents more and more accurately , i.e , the precision cosmology era comes . except for the long standing puzzling dark matter component , an unknown cosmic matter - energy constituent refereed to the so called dark energy may also exist that accelerates our universe expansion now , which contradicts with our traditional attitude on the behavior of conventional matter but it is eventually confirmed by recent observations like sne ia @xcite @xcite and cmb observations @xcite .",
    "the cosmological dark sector , often divided as the mysterious dm and de sectors respectively , takes around @xmath1 of total energy budget of our universe .",
    "the concord @xmath0cdm model could be consistent with most of global astrophysics observational results .",
    "but the introduction of the cosmological constant simultaneously results in the yet to answer problems related directly to how to understand the fundamental physics theory , like the fine - tuning and the coincidence problems respectively . at the same time , `` most '' of course does not equal to `` all '' , some astrophysics problems still need be clarified and solved in the framework of the @xmath0cdm model @xcite , such as the the core singularities of the cold matter halo profiles . with the aim to understand the cosmic acceleration or dark energy phenomena , many theoretical models have been proposed , like the scalar field models and the modified einstein gravity models @xcite @xcite @xcite .    due to the limited scope of our experimental and observational tools , we have not yet been able to understand the `` dark '' nature and to detect the origin of dm and de .",
    "purely gravitational probes can not provide enough information to differentiate these two kinds of mysterious constitutions either .",
    "therefore , from the phenomenological and practical point of view , a single ( unified dm with de ) fluid description may be more plausible at least in the cosmic evolution description , which utilizes a single equation of state to model the dark matter and dark energy contributions together @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "generally , such models has a non - constant equation of state ( eos ) , which reflects both its dynamical and thermodynamics characters .",
    "the density dependent equation of state is widely investigated , such as the famous chaplygin gas and generalized chaplygin gas models , which assume an eos form like the @xmath2 where the @xmath3 is a model parameter .",
    "another practical method to modify the eos is by the introduction of cosmic viscosity media contribution which replaces the simplest perfect fluid eos on a more physical and realistic basis . in the homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker frame , only a bulk viscosity term which behaves as an additive pressure contribution can mimic both the two dark components and their coupling effects by playing a main role to influence the cosmic evolution .",
    "different forms of the viscosity coefficients have been proposed like the density @xmath4 dependent @xcite or the redshift @xmath5 dependent @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we will proceed our effort on the investigation of the viscosity dark fluid model to study the scalar perturbation of this model , for perturbation analysis can provide us a powerful tool to differentiate and constrain cosmology models finely as the calculation of perturbation quantities links the theoretical models with more plentiful and precise observations , like the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structure observation .",
    "there have been some researches on the perturbation evolution of the viscosity models @xcite @xcite @xcite , by which we know that after corresponding model parameters chosen properly , the chaplygin gas formulation can be viewed as a special case of the density dependent viscosity model . in the non - perturbative",
    "( zero order ) level , the chaplygin gas model can be exactly solved and fit the observational data well .",
    "but it has been found that in the perturbation level , there exist some unacceptable behaviors , like the blow up of density perturbation evolution and other peculiar behaviors @xcite @xcite .",
    "one motivation to build other kinds of the viscosity models is to overcome these difficulties the chaplygin gas models possess . here",
    ", we will consider a time - dependent viscosity coefficient model , which is equivalent to the introduction of a general equation of state(eos ) @xcite .",
    "the general eos is @xmath6 in the background , this model can fit the current astrophysics observational datasets consistently .",
    "we derive its perturbation equations that govern the evolution of gravitational potential and density perturbation below .",
    "we numerically solve the perturbation equation , and compare it with that of conventional @xmath0cdm model and the chaplygin gas model finding that the dark fluid model behaves well in different scales .",
    "though there exists some value difference between the @xmath0cdm model and the dark fluid model in the late time evolution , their gravitational potential and density contrast shape and evolution behavior are similar by plotting respectively .",
