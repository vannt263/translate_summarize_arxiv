    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are brief , intense flashes of @xmath0-rays originating at cosmological distances , and they are the most luminous objects in the universe .",
    "they also have broadband afterglows long - lasting after the @xmath0-ray radiation has ceased .",
    "it has been established that the bursts and afterglows are emitted from outflows moving towards us at highly relativistic speeds @xcite , and at least some grbs are associated with the collapse of massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "observations suggest that the burst is produced by internal dissipation within the relativistic jet that is launched from the center of the explosion , and the afterglow is the synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated in a collisionless shock driven by the interaction of the jet with the surrounding medium ( for recent reviews , * ? ? ?",

    "in spite of extensive observational and theoretical efforts , several key questions concerning the nature of the central engines of the relativistic jets and the jets themselves remain poorly understood .",
    "in fact , some of these questions are very difficult or even impossible to answer with the spectral and lightcurve information currently collected . on the other hand ,",
    "polarization information , if retrieved , would lead to unambiguous answers to these questions . in particular",
    ", polarimetric observations of grbs can address the following :    _ magnetic composition of grb jets  _ it is highly speculated that strong magnetic fields are generated at the grb central engine , and may play an essential role in the launch of the relativistic jets .",
    "however , it is unclear whether the burst emission region is penetrated by a globally structured , dynamically important magnetic field , and whether the burst is due to shock dissipation or magnetic reconnection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    _ emission mechanisms of the bursts  _ the leading model for the emission mechanism of the prompt burst emission is synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons in a globally ordered magnetic field carried from the central engine , or random magnetic fields generated in - situ in the shock dissipation region @xcite .",
    "other suggestions include compton drag of ambient soft photons @xcite , synchrotron self - compton emission @xcite , and the combination of a thermal component from the photosphere and a non - thermal component ( e.g. , synchrotron ) @xcite .    _ geometric structure of grb jets  _ although it is generally believed that grb outflows are collimated , the distribution of the jet opening angles , the observer s viewing direction , and whether there are small - scale structures within the global jet are not well understood @xcite .    to date , robust positive detections of grb polarization have been made only in the optical band in the afterglow phase .",
    "varying linear polarizations have been observed in several optical afterglows several hours after the burst trigger , with a level of @xmath6 , which is consistent with the synchrotron emission mechanism of grb afterglow ( for reviews , see * ? ? ?",

    "as for the prompt burst emission , strong linear polarization of the @xmath0-ray emission at a level of @xmath9 was claimed for grb 021206 based on an analysis of _ rhessi _ data @xcite , although this claim remains controversial because of large systematic uncertainties @xcite .",
    "several other reports of high levels of polarization in the prompt burst emission are also statistically inconclusive @xcite .",

    "the payload consists of two wide field of view ( fov ) instruments : a low energy polarimeter ( lep ) capable of polarization measurements in the 2 - 15 kev energy range and a high energy polarimeter ( gamma - ray polarimeter experiment ; grape ) that will measure polarization in the 60 - 500 kev energy range .",
    "_ poet _ can measure grb spectra from 2 kev up to 1 mev .",
    "the _ poet _",
    "spacecraft provides a zenith - pointed platform for maximizing the exposure to deep space and spacecraft rotation provides a means of effectively dealing with systematics in the polarization response .",

    "lep and grape determine polarization by measuring the number of events versus the event azimuth angle ( eaa ) as projected onto the sky .",
    "this is referred to as a modulation profile and represents a measure of the polarization magnitude and direction of polarization for the incident beam .",
    "depending on the type of polarimeter , the eaa is either the direction of the ejected photoelectron ( lep ) or the direction of the scattered photon ( grape ) .",
    "the response of a polarimeter to @xmath10 polarized photons can be quantified in terms of the modulation factor , @xmath11 , which is given by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the maximum and minimum of the modulation profile , respectively .",
    "the polarization fraction ( @xmath2 ) of the incident flux is obtained by dividing the measured modulation by that expected for @xmath10 polarized flux . the polarization angle ( @xmath15 )",
    "corresponds either to the maximum of the modulation profile ( lep ) or the minimum of the modulation profile ( grape ) . to extract these parameters from the data , the modulation histograms are fit to the functional form : @xmath16",
    "the sensitivity of a polarimeter is defined in terms of the minimum detectable polarization ( mdp ) , which refers to the minimum level of polarization that is detectable with a given observation ( or , equivalently , the apparent polarization arising from statistical fluctuations in unpolarized data ) .",
    "the precise value of the mdp will depend on the source parameters ( fluence , spectrum , etc . ) and the polarimeter characteristics . at the @xmath17 confidence level ,",

    "is based on the fact that , in compton scattering , photons are preferentially scattered at a right angle to the incident electric field vector ( the polarization vector ) @xcite .",
    "if the incident beam of photons is polarized , the azimuthal distribution of scattered photons will be asymmetric .",
    "the direction of the polarization vector is defined by the minimum of the scatter angle distribution .",
    "the grape performance characteristics are shown in table [ tabparam ] .",
    "the design of the grape instrument is very modular , with 62 independent polarimeter modules and 2 spectroscopy modules .",

    "the arrangement of scintillator elements within a module has 28 bgo calorimeter elements surrounding 32 plastic scintillator scattering elements .",
    "valid polarimeter events are those in which a photon compton scatters in one of the plastic elements and is subsequently absorbed in one of the bgo elements .",
    "these events can be identified as a coincident detection between one plastic scintillator element and one bgo calorimeter element .",
    "the azimuthal scatter angle is determined for each valid event by the relative locations of hit scintillator elements .",
    "it is not necessary to know where within each element the interaction takes place ( e.g. , the depth of interaction ) .",
    "it is sufficient to know only the lateral location of each element to generate a histogram of photon scatter angles .    at energies below @xmath28  kev ,",
    "the most sensitive technique for broadband polarimetry is the photoelectric effect .",
    "the lep measures the polarization of incident photons with the innovative operation of a time projection chamber ( tpc ) @xcite .",
    "the lep polarimeter enclosure consists of four dual - readout detector modules each with an isolated gas volume contained by a be x - ray window .",
    "each detector module contains two 6 x 12 x 24 @xmath29 ( lxwxh ) tpcs that share a single x - ray transparent drift electrode .",
    "each tpc is comprised of a micropattern proportional counter , consisting of a shared drift electrode and a high - field gas electron multiplier ( gem ) positioned 1 mm from a strip readout plane . when an x - ray is absorbed in the gas between the drift electrode and the gem ,",
    "a photoelectron is ejected in a preferential direction with a @xmath30 distribution , where @xmath31 is the azimuthal angle measured from the x - ray polarization vector . as the photoelectron travels through the gas it creates a path of ionization that drifts in a moderate , uniform field to the gem where an avalanche occurs .",
    "the charge finally drifts to the strip detector where it is read out .",

    "figure  [ fig : cum_q1 ] shows the results for @xmath244 and the same ` typical ' values for the other parameters . since the ratio of the number of the bursts with smaller @xmath111 to that of detectable bursts is smaller , @xmath243 is slightly smaller than that for the ` typical ' parameters in the sr and cd models .",
    "figure  [ fig : cum_q2 ] shows the results for @xmath245 and the ` typical ' values for the other parameters . in this case",
    "@xmath243 is slightly larger than that for the ` typical ' parameters in the sr and cd models .",
    "the number @xmath243 in the so model is similar for figure  [ fig : cum_1 ] , [ fig : cum_q1 ] , and figure  [ fig : cum_q2 ] in the grape band . to summarize , for the parameters @xmath246 , @xmath247 , @xmath241 , @xmath203 and @xmath114 , we can say that @xmath3 for grape and the cumulative distribution of measurable @xmath2 varies rapidly from @xmath231 in the so model . for the sr model , @xmath248 for grape , with a maximum polarization @xmath233 . for the cd model , @xmath4 for grape , and @xmath235 .",
    "since the dependence of the polarization degree on the spectral indices is relatively large in the so and sr models , we should take account of the distribution of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the observed spectral parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 are distributed roughly as @xmath249 and @xmath250 @xcite . within these ranges of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the polarization degree for @xmath251 , @xmath129 , and @xmath252  kev is @xmath253 in the so model .",

    "the maximum polarization obtained in the sr model for @xmath254 and @xmath255 is @xmath136 ( see   [ subsec : sr ] ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we can constrain the emission mechanism of grbs by using the cumulative distribution obtained by grape . if @xmath3 , the sr and cd models may be ruled out , and in this case if the measured polarizations are clustered at @xmath253 , the so model will be favored . if @xmath4 , the so model may be ruled out , but we can not distinguish between the sr and cd models with different distributions of @xmath111 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "if several bursts with @xmath5 are detected , however , the cd model which includes adequate number of small @xmath111 bursts will be favored .",
    "recently there has been an increasing interest in the measurement of x - ray and @xmath0-ray polarization , and the observational techniques can now achieve significant sensitivity in the relevant energy bands .",
    "several polarimetry mission concepts , such as _ poet _ , are being planned .",
    "the _ poet _",
    "concept has two polarimeters , grape ( 60 - 500  kev ) and lep ( 2 - 15  kev ) both of which have wide fields of view .",
    "if launched , missions of this type would provide the first definitive detection of the polarization of grb prompt emission .",
    "this would enable the discussion of the statistical properties of the polarization degree and polarization spectra , which will give us diagnostic information on the emission mechanism of grbs and the nature of the grb jets that can not be obtained from current spectra and lightcurve observations .",
    "we have performed monte carlo simulations of the linear polarization from grb jets for three major emission models : synchrotron model with globally ordered magnetic field ( so model ) , synchrotron model with small - scale random magnetic field ( sr model ) , and compton drag model ( cd model ) .",
    "we assumed that the physical quantities for the emission of the jets are uniform on the emitting surface and that the jets have sharp edges .",
    "our jet angle distribution allows the detections of grbs with very small opening angles ( i.e. , smaller than 1 degree ) as suggested by several _",
    "bursts @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the _ poet _ mission or other polarimeters with similar capabilities , i.e. , broadband spectral capabilities for the determination of @xmath33 and sensitive broadband polarimetric capabilities to minimize mdp , can constrain the emission models of grbs .",
    "furthermore , these simulations indicate that an increase in the lep effective area would be beneficial to compensate for the lower expected polarization at lower energies .    as shown in figures  [ fig : atorob ] , [ fig : arndb ] , and [ fig : acomp ] , the sr and cd models require off - axis observations of the jets to achieve a high level of polarization , while the so model does not . in this sense",
    "the sr and cd models are categorized as _ geometric _ models , and the so model as an _ intrinsic _ model @xcite .",
    "the distribution of observed polarizations obtained by our simulations show that the geometric sr / cd models will be ruled out if the number ratio of the @xmath2-measurable bursts to detected bursts is larger than @xmath256 , and in this case the so model will be favored if the measurable polarizations are clustered at @xmath253 .",
    "if the number ratio is smaller than @xmath257 , the so model may be ruled out , but we can not distinguish between the sr and cd models with different distributions of @xmath150 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , where @xmath0 and @xmath48 are the bulk lorentz factor and the opening angle of the grb jet , respectively , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are lower and higher indices of the energy spectrum .",
    "however , if several bursts with @xmath5 are detected , the cd model which includes an adequate number of small @xmath111 bursts will be favored .",
    "if the cumulative distribution of the measurable polarizations favors the so model , the globally ordered magnetic field would be advected from the central engine .",
    "if we understand the strength of the magnetic field in the emitting region from the luminosity and the spectrum of the emission , we can constrain the strength of the field at the central engine .",
    "if the geometric sr / cd models are favored from the observations , it will be established , independently of the afterglow observations , that grb outflows are not spherical but highly collimated .",
    "if the cd model is favored by the observations , we may constrain the distribution of the parameter @xmath258 of grb jets .",
    "the cd model needs a dense optical / uv photon field interacting within the relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "we have made some simplifications in our simulations , and there are some caveats .",
    "we have assumed that the jets are uniform on the emitting surfaces and have sharp edges . to compare the simulations and the observations further , more sophisticated modeling is required ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have interpreted bursts as a simple combination of pulses , without taking account of the temporal variation of the lorentz factor @xmath0 of the jet .",
    "if this is accounted for , each pulse may have different @xmath150 but the same @xmath149 .",
    "we should then average the polarization with respect to fluence of each pulse having different @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "however , in the so model , the cumulative distribution of measurable @xmath2 will not be changed significantly as long as @xmath259 , because @xmath2 is clustered into a small range for @xmath129 and @xmath251 . to average the polarization in the case of @xmath219 , the relation between the luminosity and the lorentz factor for each pulse is required to predict the polarization distribution .    for the sr model",
    "we have assumed that the directions of the magnetic field are confined within the shock plane .",
    "they may be more isotropic in reality , in which case the polarization degree in the sr model will be reduced .    in the synchrotron model with a combination of the globally ordered magnetic field and the locally random field , @xmath260 ,",
    "the linear polarization can be calculated by @xmath261 , where @xmath262 and @xmath263 are the stokes parameters from the ordered and random fields , respectively . @xmath264 and @xmath265",
    "are described by equations ( [ eq : atorob ] ) and ( [ eq : arndb ] ) , and @xmath266 .",
    "this model will reduce the number ratio of @xmath2-measurable bursts to detected bursts to less than 30% and the clustering of measurable polarizations will be at @xmath267 .",
