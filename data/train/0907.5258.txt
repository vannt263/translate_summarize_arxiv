    "although casimir effect has attracted a lots of attention due to its important roles in various fields of physics @xcite , there have been relatively few works on casimir effect for quantum fields subject to robin boundary conditions .",
    "robin boundary conditions arise naturally in the study of casimir effect for electromagnetic fields in perfectly conducting spheres @xcite .",
    "however , in parallel plate configuration , perfectly conducting boundary conditions only lead to dirichlet boundary conditions and neumann boundary conditions .",
    "nevertheless , it was shown that in some geometries , robin boundary conditions can be considered as extensions of perfectly conducting boundary conditions , where the robin coefficients are related to the skin - depth parameter describing the finite penetration of the field into the boundary @xcite .",
    "robin type conditions are needed for conformally invariant field theories in the presence of boundaries , since robin boundary conditions can be made conformally invariant , but ordinary neumann boundary conditions can not .",
    "the casimir effect for fields with robin boundary conditions was studied from different perspectives and under different context in @xcite for parallel plate geometry , in @xcite for a @xmath0-dimensional ball , in @xcite for spherical shell geometry , and in @xcite for the configuration of two spheres . on the other hand , quantum fields with nonlocal boundary conditions",
    "can also be reduced to one with robin boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the importance of the robin boundary conditions to spacetime models and quantum gravity has been emphasized in @xcite . for randall - sundrum spacetime model @xcite ,",
    "robin boundary conditions are natural for scalar fields and fermion fields , where the robin coefficients are related to the curvature scale and the boundary mass terms of the fields @xcite .",
    "casimir effect in braneworld models with robin boundary conditions on the branes was discussed extensively in @xcite .    despite the importance of the robin boundary conditions in field theory , the research on casimir effect with robin boundary conditions",
    "has been limited to a small community , and very few of the works has taken into account the influence of finite temperature .",
    "the goal of this paper is to consider the thermal casimir effect for the parallel plate configuration .",
    "since spacetimes with extra dimensions have become prevalent in physics , we are going to discuss along this line .",
    "our setup is the same as in @xcite , i.e. , we consider a pair of codimension one parallel plates in the background spacetime @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the @xmath3-dimensional minskowski spacetime , and @xmath4 is a compact internal space .",
    "in fact , casimir effect on parallel plates in a background spacetime of this form has been investigated in @xcite , when the boundary conditions are either dirichlet boundary conditions or neumann boundary conditions in the case of scalar fields , and perfect conductor boundary conditions in the case of electromagnetic fields . in the cases considered in @xcite ,",
    "the dimension of the macroscopic space is @xmath5 and the internal space is assumed to be the simplest one - dimensional compact space @xmath6 or the more general @xmath7-dimensional toroidal manifold @xmath8 . in @xcite , the internal space is generalized to arbitrary compact manifold and the parallel plates are allowed to be finite with arbitrary cross section .",
    "the temperature corrections to the casimir effect in the scenario of @xcite were considered in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that for massless scalar field with dirichlet boundary conditions on both plates or neumann boundary conditions on both plates , the casimir force is always attractive , at any temperature and for any spacetime geometry .",
    "for massless scalar field with dirichlet boundary condition on one plate and neumann boundary condition on another plate , the casimir force is always repulsive .",
    "the present work can be considered as a generalization of @xcite to take into account the finite temperature correction , or a generalization of @xcite where the boundary conditions are the more general robin boundary conditions instead of the dirichlet boundary conditions or neumann boundary conditions .",
    "we are mainly interested in studying the dependence of the casimir force on the interplay between the spacetime geometry , temperature and boundary conditions .    as in @xcite",
    ", we first consider the casimir force acting on a piston which moves freely inside a closed cylinder with arbitrary cross section ( see fig .",

    "[ ce ] , the casimir energy in the two regions divided by piston is computed using cut - off method . in section [ cf ] , the casimir force acting on the piston is derived . the limit where one end of the cylinder is moved to infinity is equivalent to two parallel plates embedded orthogonally inside an infinitely long cylinder . letting the cross section of the plates become infinitely large give the usual infinite parallel plate configuration .",
    "this piston scenario introduced by cavalcanti @xcite has the advantage that the contribution to the casimir force due to the vacuum fluctuations of the quantum fields in the region between the plates and the region outside the plates are both taken into account , and the divergences of the casimir forces from the two regions will cancel . in section [ acf ] , we study in detail the sign of the casimir force at small and large plate separations .    in this article , we use the units where @xmath9 .",

    "moreover , since each term in the sum of and is positive , and the sum of the @xmath51 terms in and corresponds to the casimir forces without extra dimensions , we find that when is satisfied , the presence of extra dimensions enhances the magnitude of the casimir force .",

    "as is already observed in section [ cf ] , when the robin conditions on the two plates are the same , i.e. , @xmath111 , then the casimir force is always attractive .",
    "if @xmath184 satisfies , so does @xmath222 .",
    "the casimir force is then always attractive and its magnitude is enhanced by the presence of extra dimensions . for any @xmath223 and @xmath224 ,",
    "we have shown in section [ cf ] that the casimir force is always attractive when the plate separation is small enough .",
    "in the other extreme where @xmath187 , if the temperature @xmath112 is not zero , the dominating term of the casimir force is given by the term with @xmath225 and @xmath226 in .",
    "we conclude that when @xmath37 is large enough , then the casimir force is repulsive if @xmath227and is attractive otherwise .",

    "the graphs show that the casimir force is attractive at small @xmath37 and becomes repulsive at large @xmath37 .",

    "another interesting case is shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] , with @xmath232 and @xmath198 . in this case ,",
    "the graph shows that the casimir force is attractive at small and at large @xmath37 as dictated by our analysis above .",
    "however , the casimir force can become repulsive at some intermediate values of @xmath37 .",
    "this implies that there are two equilibrium points @xmath234 and @xmath235 , one unstable and one stable .",
    "if the initial separation of the two plates is in the range of the two equilibrium points , i.e. @xmath236 , then the two plates would tend to repulse each other until they settle at the distance @xmath237 .",
    "= 0.49=0.49    in the figures shown in this section , the size of the internal manifold is chosen to be between @xmath238 m to @xmath209 m so as to demonstrate significant difference with the casimir force without extra dimensions .",
    "extra dimensions of this size is not physically interesting .",
    "one can show that if the size of the internal manifold @xmath121 is ten times smaller than the plate separation , there is no significant difference between the casimir force with or without the internal manifold .",
    "therefore for physically interesting size of extra dimensions of order @xmath239 nm , it will not be detectable by the present experiments in casimir effect which measures casimir force between objects that are @xmath240 nm @xmath241 nm apart .    before ending this section",
    ", we would like to remark on the original setup we consider  a piston moving freely inside a closed cylinder . as is shown by , in this case , the casimir force is the difference of the casimir force between the left end of the cylinder and the piston , and the casimir force between the right end of the cylinder and the piston .",
    "since the magnitude of the casimir force is very large when the plate separation is very small , and is very small when the plate separation is very large , we can deduce that when the piston is close to one end , whether it is attracted to or pushed away from that end only depends on the robin coefficients on the piston and on that end .",
    "however , when the piston is away from both ends , then which side it will move to depends on the robin coefficients on the piston and on the two ends .",
    "there are some combinations of robin coefficients that will make the piston stay in the middle region .",
    "in this article , we studied the interplay between geometry , temperature and boundary conditions on the sign and magnitude of the casimir force acting on parallel plates .",
    "we first derived the finite temperature casimir force acting on a piston moving freely inside a closed cylinder due to a scalar field with robin boundary conditions .",
    "it is shown that even the robin coefficients on the two ends of the cylinder are different , the casimir force acting on the piston is independent of the regularization procedure , since the divergent terms of the casimir forces from the two chambers of the cylinder divided by the piston are independent of the robin coefficients and cancel each other . by moving one end of the cylinder to infinity , we obtain the casimir force acting on a pair of parallel plates . in the high temperature regime ,",
    "the leading term of the casimir force is linear in temperature , which shows that the casimir force has a classical limit .",
    "a modified abel - plana summation formula is used to rewrite the casimir force which is suitable for the analysis of its low temperature behavior .",
    "when the parallel plates has finite size , the casimir force decays exponentially when the temperature tends to zero .",
    "in case of infinite parallel plates , the temperature correction is of order @xmath150 , where @xmath170 is the dimension of the macroscopic space .",
    "interestingly , these behaviors are independent of the values of the robin parameters .",
    "the sign of the casimir force when the plate separation is small and when the plate separation is large is analyzed in detail .",
    "it is found that if dirichlet condition is imposed on one plate and non - dirichlet condition is imposed on the other plate , then the casimir force is repulsive when the plate separation is small enough .",
    "if non - dirichlet conditions are imposed on both plates , the casimir force is attractive for small enough plate separations .",
    "we give an explanation for these behaviors by the asymptotics of the frequencies .",
    "when the separation between the plates becomes sufficiently large , the sign of the casimir force depends not only on the boundary conditions , but also on the geometry of the transversal dimensions .",
    "we show that for a wide range of robin coefficients , the casimir force can change from attractive to repulsive or repulsive to attractive , giving rise to unstable equilibrium and stable equilibrium respectively .",
    "this can be applied in nanotechnology if robin conditions is used to model the skin depths of real materials .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "robin boundary conditions arise naturally in randall - sundrum spacetime model .",
    "the results in this article is not readily transferred to the randall - sundrum model except for massless scalar field that couples conformally to scalar curvature .",
    "there is a brief discussion of this in the zero temperature case in @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to consider the finite temperature casimir effect due to a bulk massive scalar field with general curvature coupling , and with general robin boundary conditions on the branes .",
    "a special case has been considered in @xcite where the thermodynamic energy was shown to have a minimum that might give rise to brane stabilization mechanism .",
