    "a new generation of large - scale structure ( lss ) surveys will come online in the next decade . in particular",
    ", there is much activity on the spectroscopic front , as many ground - based surveys , including the prime focus spectrograph ( pfs ) @xcite , fastsound @xcite , the hobby - eberly dark energy experiment ( hetdex ) @xcite , and the dark energy spectroscopic instrument ( desi ) @xcite , expect to take data in the next several years , while the space - based surveys _ euclid _ @xcite and the wide - field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ) @xcite plan to come online soon after .",
    "as more surveys are going deeper and wider to find more galaxies and collect better statistics on lss , it is becoming more important to identify systematic effects that can contaminate cosmological parameter estimates .",
    "moreover , in order to observe more galaxies at higher redshift , these future surveys will acquire spectra with lower signal - to - noise ratio than were obtained by past projects such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , which focused on relatively bright targets .",
    "sdss galaxy spectra usually had many spectral features readily identifiable by eye , but future lss surveys are likely to operate near the minimum acceptable signal - to - noise ratio for redshift determination using a _ single _ emission line .",
    "one systematic effect that could potentially contaminate future lss measurements is interloper contamination .",
    "the hubble expansion of the universe causes extragalactic emission lines to appear redshifted .",
    "while the redshift of the emission line can identify the object s hubble velocity and distance , this effect can cause two lines with different rest - frame wavelengths from different distances to appear with the same wavelength , confusing the two lines .",
    "interlopers can be problematic in power spectrum estimates as well as measurements of the correlation function , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , weak lensing , redshift - space distortions ( rsd ) , scale - dependent clustering bias , and higher - order correlations such as the bispectrum because interlopers introduce an extra source of correlation and dilute the existing correlation , distorting the power spectrum .",
    "these distortions can contaminate constraints on cosmological parameters , including those for the growth rate of structure .",
    "interlopers are also a major consideration in intensity mapping surveys @xcite , where the data product is a low - resolution data cube ( ra , dec,@xmath1 ) and the problem _ must _ be treated statistically instead of via object - by - object redshift classification .",
    "while it is possible to remove this distortion by measuring the interloper fraction in a small patch of sky , the required precision may be formidable in cases where the power spectrum measurement is very sensitive to the interloper fraction .",
    "methods have been developed to identify interloping emission lines , including simple methods such as secondary line identification and photometry @xcite as well as more complex methods such as spectral template fitting .",
    "however , these methods are limited by the lss survey parameters , including photometric bands , spectral coverage , survey depth , and ( for ground surveys ) atmospheric lines ; thus , it is important to diagnose for a specific lss survey how well interlopers can be identified within the data .    in this paper",
    ", we construct a formalism describing how a power spectrum from a lss survey is distorted by interloper contamination . this formalism",
    "is then used to determine the resulting bias within measurements of cosmological parameters .",
    "we then calculate the interloper bias for the clustering bias of sample @xmath2 and the growth rate @xmath3 as a function of the interloper fraction .",
    "we find that for pfs and wfirst , an interloper fraction @xmath4% will significantly distort power spectrum measurements over scales @xmath5mpc@xmath6 such that the @xmath7-averaged power spectrum amplitude will shift by @xmath8% of the amplitude error .",
    "we also find that an interloper fraction greater than 0.3 ( 0.15)% can significantly bias growth rate measurements for pfs ( wfirst ) .    to test",
    "if these biases will be exhibited in future surveys , we use the cosmos @xcite mock catalog ( cmc ) to construct mock surveys for the pfs [ o ]  survey and the wfirst h@xmath0 and [ o ]  surveys based on their flux sensitivity curves , for the cases of no spectral cleaning and with cleaning using secondary line identification .",
    "note that our analysis with the cmc is idealized in that it does not treat blended objects and is limited by the bank of sed templates in the catalog .",
    "we also made modifications in the cmc to better reproduce the properties of real objects in the universe .",
    "but it does represent a `` first look '' at how serious the problem might be .",
    "subject to these caveats , we determine that after secondary line identification , pfs will have an interloper fraction less than 0.2% , meaning interlopers may not be a great concern .",
    "for wfirst , on the other hand , secondary line identification will only reduce some interloper fractions to 1030% .",
    "we then determine photometric cuts using infrared photometric bands from wfirst and optical bands from the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) @xcite that reduce the interloper fractions to less than 0.2% at most redshifts in the h@xmath0 survey .",
    "in the wfirst [ o ]  survey , the interloper fractions in wfirst are still very large , and deep spectroscopic fields will be needed to precisely measure the interloper fractions . of course , deep surveys will also be needed for the pfs and wfirst h@xmath0 surveys to confirm if interloper fractions for these surveys are indeed small .",
    "we also show that the wfirst y band depth will be necessary for interloper removal .",
    "future lss emission line surveys must consider how to implement these strategies to identify interlopers , as well as determine acceptable contamination levels for other cosmological parameters .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ s : bias ] , we derive the interloper bias to the measured galaxy power spectrum and cosmological parameters as functions of the interloper fraction and redshift .",
    "we present methods to identify and remove interlopers in sec .",
    "[ s : removal ] . in sec .",
    "[ s : mock ] , we describe the mock surveys we construct for pfs and wfirst using the cmc , and we give potential interloper fractions for pfs in sec .  [ s : pfsresults ] and wfirst in sec .  [",
    "s : wfresults ] .",
    "we state our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ s : conc ] . wherever not explicitly mentioned",
    ", we assume a flat @xmath9cdm cosmology with parameters compatible with the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe seven - year data release ( wmap7 ) @xcite .",
    "in this section we derive the effect of interlopers on the matter power spectrum measurement , as well as the bias introduced in cosmological parameter measurements . we consider a hypothetical survey that maps survey emission line galaxies ( selgs ) , detected through a survey emission line ( sel ) with rest - frame wavelength @xmath10 , and is contaminated by an interloping emission line with rest - frame wavelength @xmath11 . note in this section we assume only one interloper , but we can easily extend our analysis to multiple interlopers . since emission line @xmath10 from redshift @xmath12 and emission line @xmath11 at redshift @xmath13 are observed at the same wavelength , each @xmath12 has a corresponding @xmath13 according to @xmath14      we consider a galaxy power spectrum measurement constructed from overdensity maps of number counts of galaxies , where each galaxy emits an emission line that appears to be a sel with wavelength @xmath15 .",
    "however , the number counts will include not only selgs but interloping galaxies as well .",
    "thus , the overdensity is written in terms of the total _ comoving _ number density @xmath16 in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number of interlopers divided by the selg volume element ( not redshifted to @xmath13 ) , the barred quantities ( @xmath19 ) are averaged over the survey area , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the 3d comoving position vectors of selgs and interloping galaxies , respectively .",
    "@xmath21 is the true position of an interloping galaxy at redshift @xmath13 such that it appears to be at position @xmath20 if it is assumed to be at redshift @xmath12 .",
    "we can separate the position vectors in terms of their transverse ( @xmath22 ) and radial ( @xmath23 ) components , and it can be shown that @xmath24 , the comoving distance to redshift @xmath12 , and @xmath25 ( similar expressions are true for @xmath21 ) .",
    "thus , with @xmath20 being the observed position of the interloper and @xmath21 being its true position , we define @xmath26 and @xmath27 such that @xmath28 with @xmath29 it is evident from eqs .",
    "[ e : zint ] and [ e : gamma ] that @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) for @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) . for @xmath27",
    ", @xmath32 causes @xmath34 , and vice - versa , making the behavior of @xmath27 less trivial . for @xmath32",
    ", we find @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) for @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) where @xmath39 and @xmath40{\\frac{1-\\omega_m}{\\omega_m}\\lambda(\\lambda+1)}\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a flat @xmath9cdm universe .",
    "the opposite is true for @xmath33 .",
    "we now assert the existence of an interloper fraction @xmath41 , such that the number density of interlopers is @xmath41 times the total number density of objects , or @xmath42 .",
    "thus , @xmath43 is a map with no interloper contamination , and @xmath41 approaches unity as the interloper contamination increases .",
    "the quantity @xmath41 is averaged over the sky and over each redshift bin , so that it does not contain lss fluctuations and is not a random field .",
    "we write @xmath44 in terms of @xmath41 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , according to @xmath47 thus , we can separate @xmath48 into the overdensities of the two sets of galaxies , in the form @xmath49 a similar equation exists for the fourier transform of this expression , except that the fourier transform of the interloper term becomes @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "this implies that the covariance of @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a 3d delta function .",
    "since the two sets of galaxies are at very different redshifts , their overdensities should be uncorrelated . in particular , of the cases considered in this paper , the most significant interloper effect is h@xmath0 and [ o ]  ( @xmath55 ) , implying that the redshift separation of the contaminants is @xmath56 .. this does not occur in this paper , but it does occur in the case of si iii 1206   contamination in the lyman-@xmath0 forest , where the target and contaminating lines are separated by only 2300 km / s ; see e.g. @xcite . ] note that gravitational lensing could induce small correlations @xcite between the selgs and the interlopers , though we will neglect them in our analysis .",
    "thus , the total 3d galaxy power spectrum @xmath57 , including redshift - space distortions ( rsd ) with @xmath58 , can be written as the sum of the two individual components , according to @xmath59\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is given by @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the power spectrum in real space and @xmath66 , with @xmath2 being the galaxy bias relating visible to dark matter halos .",
    "strictly speaking , the shot noise will also vary with the interloper fraction .",
    "but since it is usually fitted and subtracted from the measured power spectrum , we only consider the interloper bias to the clustering power spectrum . in figs .",
    "[ f : pkbias1 ] and [ f : pkbias2 ] , we plot the biased , spherically averaged , linear clustering power spectrum due to interlopers for various redshifts and values of @xmath9 along with errors predicted for the pfs survey assuming no contamination . for the clustering bias",
    ", we assume @xmath67 , a fit @xcite to semi - analytic models @xcite at the pfs flux limit that compares well with data . according to this model , lower flux limits can increase @xmath2 by @xmath68 , and we find that the change in the fractional interloper distortion to the power spectrum due to increasing @xmath2 by one is much smaller than the pfs errors for small interloper fractions ( @xmath69% ) .",
    "the same should be true for distortions to cosmological parameters .",
    "in table [ t : bnrbias ] , we show the bias - to - noise ratio ( bnr ) , which is the ratio of the interloper bias of @xmath70 to its statistical error , averaged over the interval @xmath71mpc@xmath6 .",
    "we find that an interloper contamination @xmath72 would bias the overall power spectrum signal relative to the @xmath70 errors ( @xmath73 ) , such that the total measurement errors @xmath74 for pfs would increase by more than 10% . for wfirst",
    ", this occurs if @xmath75 . for @xmath76 in either survey , we have @xmath77 , which would be catastrophic for power spectrum measurements .",
    "thus , throughout our analysis @xmath78 will be our target interloper fraction ; but note that if we have a significant interloper fraction that can be measured within @xmath79% , then we can accurately model the power spectrum of the selgs well enough to account for it , particularly if the interloper contribution is small .",
    "note that the pfs and wfirst designs have continued to evolve ; we use the point designs in @xcite and @xcite but note that the analysis herein will have to be revisited for the final specifications .",
    "nonlinear clustering could in principle modify our predictions on small scales .",
    "several prescriptions exist for describing nonlinear clustering , including halofit @xcite , convolution lagrangian perturbation theory @xcite , effective field theory @xcite , renormalization methods @xcite , and the halo model @xcite .",
    "in addition , nonlinear peculiar velocities can produce `` fingers of god '' ( fog ) effects @xcite in the power spectrum .",
    "more detailed work has been considered in the literature regarding nonlinear biasing @xcite and nonlinear rsd @xcite , yet here we will only consider a basic nonlinear clustering model . specifically , as an example we consider the nonlinear power spectrum using the halofit prescription computed from camb @xcite along with a fog damping term given in eq .  10 of @xcite with @xmath80 mpc/@xmath81 .",
    "we find that the change in the fractional interloper distortion to the power spectrum due to nonlinear clustering is much smaller than the pfs errors for small interloper fractions ( @xmath69% ) .    for the specific purpose of constraining the effects of interlopers on bao , we computed the bao shifts for each of the cases in table 1 ( _ i.e. _ each combination of @xmath82 , @xmath9 , and @xmath41 ) . in each case , we computed the linear power spectrum , with interlopers , at each value of @xmath83 from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.1 , and did a template fit as in @xcite , eq .  1 .",
    "the fits used a quadratic polynomial for @xmath84 , a 7th order polynomial for @xmath85 , and used the range of wavenumbers 0.020.3 @xmath81/mpc .",
    "fits were performed with shot noise levels appropriate for both @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( measured at @xmath88/mpc ) ; see @xcite eq .",
    "b3 for the explicit equation .",
    "the shift in the bao scale is parameterized by @xmath0 , which re - scales the positions of the bao features ; @xmath89 in the fiducial cosmology with no biases , but @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) indicates that the as - measured bao ruler is shorter ( longer ) than the fiducial case .",
    "for the four combinations of @xmath82 and @xmath9 , the largest shifts @xmath92 computed are at most 0.25%  for @xmath93 , 0.06%  for @xmath94 , 0.016%  for @xmath95 , and 0.004%  for @xmath96 .",
    "thus the bao appears to be more robust against interlopers than the broadband power spectrum .",
    "the reason for this is that while interlopers dilute the power spectrum by a factor of @xmath97 ( see eq .",
    "9 ) , this dilution has no effect on the power spectrum shape ; only the @xmath98 term coming from the clustering of the contaminants moves the bao feature .",
    "it is thus both expected and numerically confirmed that the error in bao measurements scales as @xmath99 .",
    "we also see that the bao peak shift is negligible , even at the tenth - of - a - percent level of interest to future surveys , for @xmath100 .",
    "however , although a pure dilution ( _ i.e. _ adding unclustered fake sources into the sample ) would also not effect the measured rsd parameter @xmath101 , it would reduce the effective clustering bias of the sample .",
    "this would in turn reduce the measured growth rate @xmath102 , which plays a large role in constraining modified gravity .",
    "this is an example of the importance of a precise knowledge of the interloper fraction .     the predicted ratio between the measured 3d spherically - averaged galaxy power spectrum for @xmath103 ( interlopers with longer wavelengths ) assuming various levels of interloper contamination and the 3d power spectrum with no contaminations , along with 1@xmath104 errors bars predicted for the pfs survey , where @xmath105 .",
