    "the search for a mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking , and in particular for a standard model ( sm ) higgs boson has been a major goal of particle physics for many years , and is a central part of the fermilab tevatron physics program .",
    "both the cdf and collaborations have performed new combinations  @xcite of multiple direct searches for the sm higgs boson .",
    "the new searches include more data , the inclusion of additional channels , and improved analysis techniques compared to previous analyses .",
    "the sensitivities of these new combinations significantly exceed those of previous combinations  @xcite .    in this note , we combine the most recent results of all such searches in  collisions at  .",
    "the analyses combined here seek signals of higgs bosons produced in association with vector bosons ( @xmath7 ) , through gluon - gluon fusion ( @xmath8 ) , and through vector boson fusion ( vbf ) ( @xmath9 ) corresponding to integrated luminosities up to 5.9  at cdf and up to 6.7  at d0 . in order to report an integrated luminosity corresponding to the data sample used to make our results ,",
    "we must average together the contributing searches luminosities in a way that represents their contributions to the final results .",
    "a search with a low sensitivity contributes less to the average than searches with higher sensitivity .",
    "the overall sensitivity - weighted luminosities at low and high mass are 5.8  and 6.0 , respectively .",
    "the higgs boson decay modes studied are @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    to simplify the combination ,",
    "the searches are separated into 129 mutually exclusive final states ( 56 for cdf and 73 for d0 ; see tables  [ tab : cdfacc ] and  [ tab : dzacc ] ) referred to as `` analysis sub - channels '' in this note .",
    "the selection procedures for each analysis are detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite through  @xcite , and are briefly described below .",
    "event selections are similar for the corresponding cdf and d0 analyses . for the case of ,",
    "an isolated lepton ( @xmath14 electron or muon ) and two jets are required , with one or more @xmath15-tagged jets , i.e. , identified as containing a weakly - decaying @xmath16 hadron .",
    "selected events must also display a significant imbalance in transverse momentum ( referred to as missing transverse energy or ) .",
    "events with more than one isolated lepton are vetoed .    for the d0  analyses ,",
    "the data are split by lepton type and jet multiplicity ( two or three jet sub - channels ) , and in turn for each of these two non - overlapping @xmath15-tagged samples are defined , one being a single `` tight '' @xmath15-tag ( st ) sample , and the other a double `` loose '' @xmath15-tag ( dt ) sample .",
    "the tight and loose @xmath15-tagging criteria  @xcite are defined with respect to the mis - identification rate that the @xmath15-tagging algorithm yields for light quark or gluon jets ( `` mistag rate '' ) typically @xmath17 or @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "each sub - channel is analyzed separately .",
    "the outputs of random forests , trained separately for each sample and for each higgs mass , are used as the final discriminating variables in the limit setting procedure . for the cdf  analyses ,",
    "events are analyzed in two and three jet sub - channels separately , and in each of these samples the events are grouped into various lepton and @xmath15-tag categories .",
    "in addition to the selections requiring an identified lepton , events with an isolated track failing lepton selection requirements in the two jet sample , or an identified loose muon in the extended muon coverage in the three jet sample , are analyzed separately in their own categories .",
    "these additional categories provide some acceptance for poorly reconstructed electrons as well as single prong tau decays . within the lepton categories there are four @xmath15-tagging categories considered in the two jet sample : two tight @xmath15-tags ( tdt ) , one tight @xmath15-tag and one loose @xmath15-tag ( ldt ) , one tight @xmath15-tag and one looser @xmath15-tag ( ldtx ) , and a single , tight , @xmath15-tag ( st ) .",
    "the same @xmath15-tagging categories are used for the three jets channel , although the ldtx category is not used ( events with one tight and one looser @xmath15-tags propagate into the one @xmath15-tag category ) .",
    "a bayesian neural network discriminant is trained at each @xmath19 in the test range for the two jet sample , separately for each lepton and @xmath15-tagging category , while for the three jet sample a matrix element ( me ) discriminant is used .",
    "for the  analyses , the selection is similar to the @xmath20 selection , except all events with isolated leptons are vetoed and stronger multijet background suppression techniques are applied . both cdf and",
    "d0 analyses use a track - based missing transverse momentum calculation as a discriminant against false .",
    "in addition both cdf and d0 utilize multi - variate techniques , a boosted decision tree at d0 and a neural network at cdf , to further discriminate against the multi - jet background before @xmath15-tagging .",
    "there is a sizable fraction of the  signal in which the lepton is undetected that is selected in the  samples , so these analyses are also referred to as @xmath21 .",
    "the cdf analysis uses three non - overlapping categories of @xmath15-tagged events ( tdt , ldt and st as for three jet  channels ) .",
    "d0 uses orthogonal st and tight - loose double - tag ( tldt ) channels .",
    "cdf uses neural - network outputs for the final discriminating variables , while d0 uses boosted decision tree outputs . for this combination d0",
    "has updated the tldt sample to use 6.4 fb@xmath22 of data and refined the input variables to the decision trees , including , amongst others , event characteristics sensitive to whether the jets originated from a color singlet object .",
    "the  analyses require two isolated leptons and at least two jets .",
    "d0 s  analyses separate events into non - overlapping samples of events with one tight @xmath15-tag ( st ) and two loose @xmath15-tags ( ldt ) .",
    "cdf separates events into single tag ( st ) , double tag ( tdt ) and loose double tag ( ldt ) samples . to increase signal acceptance d0",
    "has loosened the selection criteria for one of the leptons to include an isolated track not reconstructed in the muon detector ( @xmath23 ) or an electron from the inter - cryostat region of the d0 detector ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "combined with the dielectron ( @xmath25 ) and dimuon ( @xmath26 ) analyses , these provide four orthogonal analyses , and each uses 4.2 fb@xmath22 of data .",
    "most recently the @xmath25 and @xmath26 channels have been updated to include 6.2 fb@xmath22 of data .",
    "cdf has added for this combination additional sub - channels for candidate events with two loose muon candidates selected using a neural network discriminant .",
    "events in the new category are analyzed separately depending on the trigger path ( muon or ) from which they were selected .",
    "d0 applies a kinematic to optimize reconstruction .",
    "cdf corrects jet energies for  using a neural network approach . for the d0 analysis random forests of decision trees provide the final variables for setting limits , while cdf utilizes outputs of two - dimensional neural networks incorporating likelihoods based on event probabilities obtained from me calculations as additional inputs .    for the  analyses ,",
    "signal events are characterized by large  and two opposite - signed , isolated leptons .",
    "the presence of neutrinos in the final state prevents the accurate reconstruction of the candidate higgs boson mass .",
    "d0 selects events containing large  and electrons and/or muons , dividing the data sample into three final states : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "final states involving leptonic tau decays and mis - identified hadronic tau decays are included .",
    "the @xmath27 and @xmath29 analyses are as in ref .",
    "the @xmath28 channel has been updated , and now uses 6.7 fb@xmath22 of data as well as subdividing the dataset according to the number of jets in the event : 0 , 1 , or 2 + jets .",
    "cdf separates the  events in five non - overlapping samples , split into both `` high @xmath30 '' and `` low @xmath30 '' categories based on lepton types and different categories based on the number of reconstructed jets : 0 , 1 , or 2 + jets . the sample with two or more jets is not split into low @xmath30 and high @xmath30 lepton categories due to low statistics .",
    "a sixth cdf channel is the low dilepton mass ( @xmath31 ) channel , which accepts events with @xmath32  gev .",
    "this channel increases the sensitivity of the @xmath11 analyses at low @xmath19 , adding 10% additional acceptance at @xmath33  gev .",
    "the division of events into jet categories allows the analysis discriminants to separate three different categories of signals from the backgrounds more effectively .",
    "the signal production mechanisms considered are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and vector - boson fusion . for @xmath8 ,",
    "recent work  @xcite indicates that the theoretical uncertainties due to scale and pdf variations are significantly different for the different jet categories .",
    "cdf and d0 divide the theoretical uncertainty on @xmath8 into pdf and scale pieces , and utilize the differential uncertainties of  @xcite .",
    "the d0 @xmath27 and @xmath29 channels use neural - network discriminants , including the number of jets as an input , as the final discriminant while the @xmath28 channel relies on boosted decision tree outputs with additional input variables now included for the 1 and 2 + jet sub - channels .",
    "cdf uses neural - network outputs , including likelihoods constructed from calculated me probabilities as additional inputs for the 0-jet bin .",
    "d0 has updated its  analyses to include additional data and an improved discriminant .",
    "the associated vector boson and the @xmath36 boson from the higgs boson decay that has the same charge are required to decay leptonically , thereby defining three like - sign dilepton final states ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 ) .",
    "the combined output of two decision trees , trained against the instrumental and diboson backgrounds respectively , is used as the final discriminant .",
    "cdf also includes a separate analysis of events with same - sign leptons and large  to incorporate additional potential signal from associated production events in which the two leptons ( one from the associated vector boson and one from a w boson produced in the higgs decay ) have the same charge .",
    "cdf for the first time also incorporates three tri - lepton channels to include additional associated production contributions where leptons result from the associated w boson and the two w bosons produced in the higgs decay or where an associated z boson decays into a dilepton pair and a third lepton is produced in the decay of either of the w bosons resulting from the higgs decay . in the latter case , cdf separates the sample into 1 jet and 2 + jet sub - channels to fully take advantage of the higgs mass constraint available in the 2 + jet case where all of the decay products are reconstructed .",
    "for the first time cdf also includes opposite - sign channels in which one of the two lepton candidates is a hadronic tau .",
    "events are separated into @xmath40-@xmath41 and @xmath42-@xmath41 channels .",
    "the final discriminants are obtained from boosted decision trees which incorporate both hadronic tau identification and kinematic event variables as inputs .",
    "also for the first time d0 includes new channels in which one of the @xmath36 bosons in the @xmath43 process decays leptonically and the other decays hadronically .",
    "electron and muon final states are studied separately , each with 5.4 fb@xmath22 of data , with random forests being used for the final discriminants .",
    "cdf contributes an analysis searching for higgs bosons decaying to a tau lepton pair , in three separate production channels : direct @xmath2 production , associated @xmath20 or @xmath44 production , and vector boson production with @xmath0 and forward jets in the final state .",
    "one or two jets are required in the event selection . in this analysis ,",
    "the final variable for setting limits is a combination of three boosted signal tree discriminants , each designed to discriminate the signal against one of the major backgrounds ( qcd multi - jets , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 ) .",
    "the theoretical systematic uncertainty on the @xmath2 production rate now takes into account recent theoretical work  @xcite which provides separate uncertainties for each jet category .",
    "d0 also contributes an analysis of the @xmath47  jets final state , which is sensitive to the @xmath48 , @xmath49 , vbf and gluon gluon fusion ( with two additional jets ) production mechanisms .",
    "a neural network output is used as the discriminant variable for runiia ( the first 1.0 fb@xmath22 of data ) , while a boosted decision tree output is used for later data .",
    "cdf also includes an updated all - hadronic analysis , which results in two @xmath15-tagging sub - channels ( tdt and ldt ) for both @xmath50 and vbf production to the @xmath51 final state .",
    "events with either four or five reconstructed jets are selected , and at least two must be @xmath15-tagged .",
    "the large qcd multi - jet backgrounds are modeled from the data by applying a measured mistag probability to the non @xmath15-tagged jets in events containing a single @xmath15-tag .",
    "neural network discriminants based on kinematic event variables including ones designed to separate quark and gluon jets are used to obtain the final limits .",
    "both d0 and cdf contribute ( cdf for the first time ) analyses searching for direct higgs boson production in which the higgs decays directly into a pair of photons .",
    "these analyses look for a signal peak in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum above the smooth background originating from standard qcd production .",
    "finally , d0 includes the channel @xmath52 . here",
    "the samples are analyzed independently according to the number of @xmath15-tagged jets and the total number of jets .",
    "the scalar sum of the transverse energies of the reconstructed objects ( @xmath53 ) is used as the discriminant variable .",
    "we normalize our higgs boson signal predictions to the most recent high - order calculations available .",
    "the @xmath8 production cross section is calculated at nnll in qcd and also includes two - loop electroweak effects , and handling of the running @xmath15 quark mass  @xcite .",
    "these calculations are refinements of the earlier nnlo calculations of the @xmath8 production cross section  @xcite .",
    "electroweak corrections were computed in refs .  @xcite .",
    "soft gluon resummation was introduced in the prediction of the @xmath8 production cross section in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 production cross section depends strongly on the gluon parton density function , and the accompanying value of @xmath54 .",
    "the cross sections used here are calculated with the mstw 2008 nnlo pdf set  @xcite .",
    "the higgs boson production cross sections are listed in table  [ tab : higgsxsec ] .",
    "we include the larger theoretical uncertainties due to scale variations and pdf variations separately for each jet bin for the @xmath8 processes as evaluated in ref .",
    "we treat the scale uncertainties as 100% correlated between jet bins and between cdf and d0 , and also treat the pdf uncertainties in the cross section as correlated between jet bins and between cdf and d0 .",
    "we include all significant higgs production modes in the high - mass search .",
    "besides gluon - gluon fusion through virtual quark loops ( ggh ) , we include higgs boson production in association with a @xmath36 or @xmath55 vector boson ( vh )  @xcite , and vector boson fusion ( vbf )  @xcite .",
    "for the low - mass searches , we target the @xmath20 , @xmath44 , vbf , and @xmath56  @xcite production modes with specific searches , including also those signal components not specifically targeted but which fall in the acceptance nonetheless .",
    "our @xmath20 and @xmath44 cross sections are from ref .",
    "we include the @xmath57 production mode in our searches for higgs bosons decaying to tau pairs and photon pairs . in order to predict the distributions of the kinematics of higgs boson signal events , cdf and d0 use the pythia  @xcite monte carlo program , with cteq5l and cteq6l  @xcite leading - order ( lo ) parton distribution functions .",
    "the higgs boson decay branching ratio predictions are calculated with hdecay  @xcite , and are also listed in table  [ tab : higgsxsec ] .",
    "we use hdecay version 3.53 .    for both cdf and d0 , events from qcd multijet ( instrumental ) backgrounds",
    "are measured in independent data samples using several different methods . for cdf ,",
