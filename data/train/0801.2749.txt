    "the field of tev gamma - ray astronomy has grown rapidly over the past several years with the advent of sensitive new gamma - ray telescopes such as h.e.s.s .  and magic .",
    "particularly interesting results have been obtained in blazar astronomy , as the total number of detected tev blazars has increased from six only a few years ago to 17 this year ( wagner 2007b ) .",
    "the majority of the detected tev blazars ( 16 of 17 ) belong to the class of high - frequency peaked bl lac objects , or hbls  so named because the two peaks in their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) occur at relatively high uv / x - ray and gev / tev energies .",
    "this two - peaked spectral energy distribution in hbls is most commonly interpreted as the result of relativistic electrons ( and possibly positrons ) radiating in a jet which is undergoing bulk relativistic motion at a small angle to the observer s line of sight , with the low - frequency peak due to synchrotron radiation , and the high - frequency peak due to inverse - compton scattering of the jet s own synchrotron photons ( synchrotron self - compton , or ssc emission ) .",
    "the tev source list is mostly limited to relatively nearby blazars ( @xmath7 ) , because of the absorption of tev gamma - rays on the extragalactic background light .",
    "the tev observations have shown dramatic variability in a number of these blazars . among the most remarkable variability events",
    "are the 200s variability timescale detected for pks 2155@xmath0304 in july 2006 by h.e.s.s .",
    "( aharonian et al .",
    "2007 ) , and the 3-minute variations detected for mkn501 in june 2005 by magic ( wagner 2007a ) .",
    "such rapid variations suggest extremely small emitting volumes and/or time compression by large relativistic doppler factors , e.g. , @xmath8 for pks 2155@xmath0304 ( aharonian et al .",
    "high doppler factors are also sometimes invoked in specific ssc models of tev blazar spectra and variability ; for example , fossati et al . ( 2007 ) consider two ssc models to explain the x - ray / tev variability of mkn 421 : one with @xmath9 ( scattering in the klein - nishina regime ) , and one with @xmath10 ( scattering in the thomson regime ) .",
    "such high doppler factors are at the upper limit of what is expected in relativistic jets , and challenge our understanding of these objects if they do in fact occur .",
    "complementary observations that are crucial to unraveling the physics of tev blazar jets are provided by the vlbi technique , which yields radio images of the relativistic jets with sub - parsec resolutions for these nearby blazars .",
    "apparent jet speeds , brightness temperatures , and limits on jet / counterjet brightness ratios can all be measured from vlbi images , and these quantities all provide constraints on fundamental jet parameters such as the bulk lorentz factor and the angle of the jet to the line - of - sight ( subject to some caveats discussed at length in @xmath11  [ disc ] ) .",
    "our understanding of the parsec - scale radio properties of the hbl class in general has been increased by the recent work of giroletti et al .",
    "( 2004a , 2006 ) .",
    "those authors studied a sample of low - redshift bl lac objects with a variety of radio instruments , and demonstrated that the radio properties of the hbls are consistent with them being the beamed versions of nearby low - luminosity fr i radio galaxies .",
    "the tev blazars thus likely have an intrinsically different parent population with weaker jets , compared to the more distant powerful blazars , which likely have fr ii parents ( e.g. , urry & padovani 1995 ) . the mean derived parsec - scale lorentz factor for the hbl class by giroletti et al .",
    "( 2004a ) , including tev sources , is only @xmath12 , much lower than the lorentz factors suggested by the tev gamma - ray emission .",
    "we have previously published a series of papers investigating the parsec - scale kinematic properties of tev - detected hbls through multi - epoch high - resolution vlbi observations , predominantly with the national radio astronomy observatory s very long baseline array ( vlba ) , and we extend that study in this paper .",
    "previous papers in this series have included : early vlba and space vlbi observations of mkn421 ( piner et al .",
    "1999 ) , vlbi observations of mkn501 ( edwards & piner 2002 ) , vlba observations of 1es1959 + 650 , pks2155@xmath0304 , and 1es2344 + 514 ( piner & edwards 2004 ) , and new vlba polarimetry observations of mkn421 ( piner & edwards 2005 ) .",
    "this fifth paper in the series adds new vlba observations of the tev blazars and whose kinematics were relatively poorly determined in piner & edwards ( 2004 ) ( hereafter paper  i ) , as well as a four - epoch series of vlba observations of  the sixth tev blazar to be discovered .",
    "altogether we present six new images of 1es1959 + 650 , four new images of h1426 + 428 , and one new polarization image of pks2155@xmath0304 , for a total of eleven new datasets .",
    "these datasets comprise the observations from our tev blazar monitoring program over the years 2001 - 2004 ( excepting the observations of mkn421 , which were published separately in piner & edwards [ 2005 ] ) .",
    "note that except for the two brightest sources ( mkn421 and mkn501 ) , the tev blazars are too faint in the radio ( @xmath13100mjy ) to be included in other vlba monitoring programs such as mojave , and they typically require long observations to obtain images of sufficient dynamic range .",
    "observational backgrounds on the three specific sources studied in this paper are presented in the results section for the specific source .",
    "our earlier work on the parsec - scale structure of tev blazars has shown a noticeable lack of superluminal components in their jets , which contrasts with the rapid superluminal motions observed in the jets of more powerful blazars , and with the high lorentz factors derived from modeling the tev emission .",
    "we have previously interpreted the general lack of superluminal components in hbls as evidence for a lower bulk lorentz factor in the parsec - scale radio - emitting region compared to the tev - emitting region .",
    "models that have been invoked to explain this ` bulk lorentz factor crisis ' include : jets that are decelerated along their length ( georganopoulos & kazanas 2003 ; wang , li , & xue 2004 ; bicknell et al .",
    "2005 ) , jets with transverse velocity structures consisting of a fast spine and a slower layer ( giroletti et al .  2004b ; ghisellini , tavecchio , & chiaberge 2005 ; henri & saug 2006 ) , or jets with opening angles large enough that unintentional averaging over multiple viewing angles ( because of limited resolution ) causes the apparent conflict ( gopal - krishna , dhurde , & wiita 2004 ; gopal - krishna , wiita , & dhurde 2006 ) . finally , gopal - krishna et al .  ( 2007 ) consider a combination of the last two models ; i.e. , large opening angle jets with transverse velocity structures .",
    "some of these models may be distinguished through the observed statistical distribution of apparent speeds in tev blazar jets ( e.g. , gopal - krishna et al .",
    "2006 ) , so we conclude the paper by presenting our current best set of tev blazar apparent speed measurements from the complete series of five papers , which consists of sixteen component speeds in six sources , and discussing the various models in the context of the current observations .",
    "in this paper we use cosmological parameters @xmath14 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ( bennett et al .",
    "when results from other papers are quoted , they have been converted to this cosmology .",
    "we observed h1426 + 428 with the vlba at 8.4ghz at four epochs between 2001 july and 2003 october , under observation codes be024 and be029 .",
    "a vlbi observation of h1426 + 428 had previously been made at 5ghz by kollgaard , gabuzda , & feigelson ( 1996 ) , however our first observation ( be024 on 2001 july 4 ) was a pilot study to see if h1426 + 428 had a parsec - scale jet that could be imaged at 8ghz with the vlba , and to determine a more accurate position for the source .",
    "that observation was carried out in phase - referencing mode both to determine a milliarcsecond ( mas ) level position , and because the correlated flux density of h1426 + 428 was uncertain .",
    "the source j1419 + 3821 , for which a sub - mas position has been determined by the international celestial reference frame ( ma et al .",
    "1998 ) , was used as the phase - reference source .",
    "j1419 + 3821 has an angular separation of 4.6@xmath18 from h1426 + 428 .",

    "such an extreme parsec - scale misalignment would most likely be due to a smaller intrinsic bend , amplified by projection effects caused by a small angle to the line - of - sight .",

    "this is the same as the brightness temperature upper limit obtained for this source in paper  i. the jet component is blended with the core component on the clean images , but because of its relatively high flux density relative to the core , it is highly significant in the model fitting .",
    "the location of this component matches well the expected location of the component labeled c2 in paper  i , so this component is subsequently referred to as c2 ( but note that the same caveats discussed in the section on h1426 + 428 about the interpretation of model fitting data over widely spaced epochs still apply ) .",

    "interestingly , a larger and diffuse gaussian component almost on top of the core is suggested by the model fitting , but not at a very significant level ( so it is not included in table  [ mfittab ] ) , but we speculate that this may represent the older component c1 crossing almost over the core as the jet bends to the north .",

    "vlba observations of the large 2 cm survey and mojave survey have shown that powerful jets form vlbi patterns that move at apparent speeds ranging from zero up to the apparent bulk speed of the jet ( lister 2006 ; cohen et al .",
    "these authors conclude that the peak apparent pattern speed measured in a jet from vlbi monitoring is then a good indicator of the apparent bulk speed of the flow . in the final column of table  [ speedtab ] , we therefore list the fastest pattern speed observed for each of these tev blazars during our monitoring .",
    "all of these fastest speeds are below about 2@xmath6 , and four of the six are subluminal .",
    "one of the following two possibilities must then apply to the apparent pattern speeds in the parsec - scale jets of the tev hbls :    1 .",
    "the pattern speeds are related to the bulk apparent speeds as described above , and the bulk apparent speeds are slower on the parsec scale in the tev hbls compared to the more powerful sources .",
    "2 .   a much larger fraction ( approaching 100% ) of the hbls have pattern speeds that are unrelated to their bulk apparent speeds than do the more powerful sources .",
    "either of these two possibilities implies a fundamental difference between the parsec - scale jets of hbls and the more powerful sources , and we discuss each possibility in turn :      if the fastest pattern speeds are an indication of the bulk apparent speed , as they are for the mojave sources , then we have a typical bulk apparent speed of about 1@xmath6 in the parsec - scale jets of the tev blazars ( the mean and median of the final column in table  [ speedtab ] are both about 1@xmath6 ) . the bulk apparent speed is a function of the bulk lorentz factor and the viewing angle , as is the doppler factor ( see equations in footnote 3 ) .",
    "if the high doppler factors implied by the high - energy observations are combined with the slow apparent speeds then very small viewing angles are obtained ( many under one degree ) , that imply unreasonable numbers of parent objects ( henri & saug 2006 ) .",
    "a statistically reasonable solution is then to adopt a lower doppler factor ( and therefore lorentz factor ) in the parsec - scale radio - emitting region than in the gamma - ray emitting region .",
    "this argument was discussed in more detail in paper  i.    a lower doppler factor and bulk lorentz factor for the parsec - scale radio emission in hbls is actually suggested by many observations other than the apparent pattern speeds . each of the observables described below depends on the bulk doppler factor of the jet , not on a pattern speed :    a. : :    the tev blazars are significantly less variable in the radio band than    are the egret blazars ( aller , aller , & hughes 2006 ) . b. : :    the tev blazars have low radio core brightness temperatures ( see    table  [ mfittab ] ) that do not require invoking relativistic doppler    factors to reduce them below possible intrinsic limits .",
    "typical    high - power sources have much higher brightness temperatures ( kovalev    et al .  2005 ; dodson et al . 2007 ) .",
    "c. : :    the measured radio powers of the cores suggest lorentz factors for    hbls of around @xmath103 , when this power is compared to    that expected from the total power at low frequency ( giroletti et    al .",
    "d. : :    the calculated inverse compton doppler factor from the vlbi cores of    hbls gives a mean lower limit to the doppler factor of    @xmath104 , and a mean lower limit to the lorentz    factor of @xmath105 ( see table  7 in giroletti et    al .",
    "thus , high lorentz factors are not required to reduce the    predicted x - ray emission from the vlbi cores below the observed    values .",

    "( 2000 ) , but the required properties could be    reproduced by assuming that the radio emitting region in hbls is less    beamed than the optical one , as could be expected if the jet    decelerates after the higher energy emitting zone ( chiaberge et    al .",
    "f. : :    the vlbi jets of the tev blazars assume a plume - like morphology beyond    a few mas from the core , in contrast to high - power jets that may    remain well - collimated to large distances .",
    "this transition to a    plume - like morphology has been interpreted as evidence for entrainment    induced deceleration in tev blazars by bicknell et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "these six observational properties all imply relatively low bulk doppler factors and lorentz factors in these parsec - scale jets .",
    "it is clear that radio observations consistently yield doppler factors and lorentz factors for the tev blazars ( and hbls in general ) about an order of magnitude lower than the high - energy observations . on the other hand ,",
    "arguing for a higher lorentz factor is the fact that no counterjets have been observed in any of the tev hbls .",
    "our observations put the limit on the jet to counterjet ratio @xmath106 at @xmath107 for most of the sources . the tightest limits on @xmath106 in a tev blazar come from high - sensitivity array ( hsa ) observations of mkn501 by giovannini , giroletti , & taylor ( 2007 ) , which constrain @xmath108 , corresponding to @xmath109 for viewing angles of a few degrees .",
    "thus , a parsec - scale lorentz factor in the radio - emitting region of @xmath110 seems consistent with the six points given above , and is just consistent with the observed jet - to - counterjet brightness ratios .",
    "a lorentz factor of @xmath110 is also consistent with the fastest apparent speeds given in table  [ speedtab ] ( except for the very slow speeds in mkn  421 and 1es1959 + 650 ) , and yields reasonable viewing angles of 2@xmath39 to 8@xmath39 for the apparent speeds between 0.5@xmath6 and 2@xmath6 .",
    "it is not surprising that these viewing angles may be substantially less than 1/@xmath51 , since these sources were selected based on their tev emission which may have a narrower beaming cone .",
    "the crucial questions then become : where is the parsec - scale radio emission located relative to the site of the gamma - ray emission , and what causes its lower lorentz factor ?",
    "one possibility is that the parsec - scale radio emission ( at light - year scales ) is located downstream of the gamma - ray emission ( at light - day scales ) , and that the jet decelerates as it moves out .",
    "georganopoulos & kazanas ( 2003 ) considered such a jet that decelerates along its length , and showed that the required values of the doppler factor in the inner jet are not as high as in the homogeneous models discussed above , because the fast inner portion of the jet can more efficiently upscatter blueshifted synchrotron photons from the slower outer portion .",

    "( 2005 ) have also modeled parsec - scale tev blazar jet deceleration that they claim physically reflects a conversion of kinetic luminosity into enthalpy flux , and concluded that such deceleration can be physically consistent with the conservation of energy and momentum in this region .",
    "a second possibility is that the jet has an inhomogeneous structure transverse to the jet axis , consisting of a fast ` spine ' which dominates the high - energy emission , and a slower ` layer ' , which dominates at lower frequencies , although such a structure is not mutually exclusive with the decelerating jet discussed above .",
    "for example , ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2005 ) proposed a jet with an initial _ transverse _ velocity structure consisting of a fast spine and a slow layer , and by taking into account the inverse compton radiation each portion produced from the seed radiation coming from the other portion , they found that the resulting anisotropic inverse compton emission from the spine may serve to decelerate it .",
    "henri & saug ( 2006 ) propose a two - flow model , consisting of a mildly relativistic outer mhd jet , and a central pair - plasma jet accelerated by the so - called ` compton rocket ' effect to higher velocities of order @xmath110 . regardless of their origin",
    ", such transverse structures may show an observational signature in the vlbi images of jets that are resolved in the transverse direction , in the form of limb - brightening or limb - darkening , according to which region is dominating the radio emission .",
    "observational signatures of limb - brightening have been claimed in the vlbi images of the tev sources mkn  501 ( giroletti et al .",
    "2004b ) , mkn  421 ( giroletti et al . 2006 ) , and m  87 ( kovalev et al .",
    "we also found some observational evidence of limb - brightening in the mkn  421 jet ( piner & edwards 2005 ) , but it was present in only some of the transverse slices , suggesting a more complex transverse emission pattern on the scales that we investigated .",
    "the jets of the three fainter ( in the radio ) tev sources considered in this paper are not detected with sufficient resolution or dynamic range in the vlba images to discern structure transverse to the jet axis ; those observations must be left to the brighter sources ( or to much more sensitive images of these sources ) .",
    "a third possibility , that the gamma - ray emission is co - spatial with the parsec - scale jet knots , was suggested by observations of knot hst-1 in m  87 ( recently reviewed by harris et al .",
    "2007 ) . that knot , lying at a distance of @xmath111 pc from the core of m  87 , would lie at angular separations of a few mas from the core in the @xmath112 tev blazars , taking into account likely projection effects in jets with viewing angles of a few degrees .",
    "that would put features like hst-1 in m  87 co - spatial with the vlbi model components in the jets of the tev blazars .",
    "if the high - energy emission is occurring in these components , that makes the different lorentz factors and doppler factors derived in the radio and the gamma - ray particularly challenging to explain .",
    "many sources in large vlbi surveys display a mix of stationary and moving components  but what we mean here is that even the _ fastest _ measured apparent pattern speed in a source may still be much less than the bulk apparent speed .",
    "the study of the 2 cm and mojave survey apparent speeds ( cohen et al .",
    "2007 ) found that a small fraction ( about 25% ) of the powerful sources showed _ only _ slow apparent pattern speeds that were unrelated to their bulk apparent speeds based on statistical arguments ( otherwise they would have unreasonably small angles to the line - of - sight , or unreasonably high intrinsic luminosities ) .",
    "if the bulk lorentz factor is indeed high in the parsec - scale jets of the tev hbls , then the fraction of these sources that have apparent pattern speeds much less than their apparent bulk speed is closer to 100% .",
    "is there then some plausible physical difference in the high and low - power jets that could cause the high - power jets to form patterns that move at the bulk speed , while the low - power jets do not ? a common model for particle acceleration and the formation of vlbi components",
    "is the shocked - jet model ( e.g. , spada et al .",
    "if such rapidly moving shocks were forming and propagating to the parsec - scale in the tev hbls , then we might expect them to be visible in the vlba monitoring , and they are not . krawczynski ( 2007 ) has suggested a model where particle acceleration in the low - power sources occurs through acceleration of parallel electron - positron or electron - proton beams rather than through shock acceleration .",
    "if a source does not form strong moving shocks , then its more continuous jet may be modeled by a series of stationary gaussians , even though the plasma is moving relativistically .",
    "other features that are due to standing shocks , or to points where the jet bends toward the line - of - sight , may also appear in jets as stationary regions of locally - enhanced emission , as they do in high - power sources .",
    "another possible physical difference between the high and low - power jets that may cause such a difference in pattern speeds is the opening angle of the ( presumably conical ) jet .",
    "this possibility is explored in the series of papers by gopal - krishna et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "according to these models , if the low - power sources have jets with considerably larger opening angles ( gopal - krishna et al .",
    "2007 ) , then what is seen in the vlbi observations is a set of observables that have been unintentionally averaged over different viewing angles , with the small viewing - angle portion of the jet being the most doppler boosted , and contributing the most to the weighted average . in that case",
    ", many sources may show slow apparent speeds typical of being viewed almost end - on , while the apparent speed _ on the axis _ of the jet is actually much higher .",
    "however , in all of the versions of this model that produce subluminal effective apparent speeds , the effective doppler factor remains quite high ( @xmath113 , see figures  3 and 4 of gopal - krishna et al .",
    "2007 ) , so that this model can not easily explain the relatively low doppler factors measured for the tev blazars in the radio as discussed in points * a * through * f * in the previous subsection ( in fact , it would predict high values for the radio variability , brightness temperature , core dominance , and inverse compton doppler factors ) .    whether or not the opening angle has a significant effect on the observables",
    "hinges on the actual value of the opening angle  the effect is small for 1@xmath39 opening angles and quite pronounced at 5@xmath39 opening angles ; but , perversely , measurements of blazar jet opening angles are of little use in testing the model , because the measurements of the opening angle are themselves effected by averaging over the true opening angle ( see figure  3 , gopal - krishna et al .",
    "however , if the opening angles are large enough to cause a significant effect , it would seem that a substantial number of sources may be expected to have core - halo type morphology on their vlbi images ( whenever the opening angle is larger than the axis viewing angle ) , so it would be useful to compare simulated vlbi images from this model with observed morphologies .",
    "the model also makes specific statistical predictions , e.g. , that a small fraction of tev blazars should show strongly superluminal motions ( gopal - krishna et al .",
    "2006 ) , so that as the number of tev blazars increases , it will be possible to test the observations against probability curves derived from this model .",
    "based on all of the available observational data , we favor a combination of possibilities 1 and 2 given at the beginning of this discussion section . from all of the other arguments for a low lorentz factor for the parsec - scale radio emission given above ( points * a * through * f * in the previous subsection ) , we consider it likely that the parsec - scale radio emitting region in the tev hbls has a substantially lower lorentz factor than is usually derived for the high - energy gamma - ray emitting region",
    ". a parsec - scale lorentz factor of about 3 is indeed consistent with the peak apparent speeds of 0.5@xmath6 to 2@xmath6 in table  [ speedtab ] , assuming these reflect the bulk apparent speed on the axis of the jet .",
    "however , the apparent speeds in two of the tev blazars ( mkn  421 and 1es1959 + 650 ) are so low that they likely represent a sub - sample of these sources where the measured pattern speeds are much less than the bulk speed , as was also found for powerful sources by cohen et al .  ( 2007 ) . the physical cause of this lorentz factor difference between the high and low - frequency emitting regions ( and whether any lorentz factor gradient occurs along the jet , transverse to the jet , or both ) , and the physical cause of any decoupling of pattern and bulk speeds has not been definitively determined , but the sample of tev blazars is growing rapidly , so that the observational statistics will improve markedly over the next several years .",
    "we have presented new multi - epoch vlbi images for the three tev blazars h  1426 + 428 , 1es  1959 + 650 , and pks  2155@xmath0304 obtained during the years 2001 to 2004 .",
    "the results for h  1426 + 428 are the first multi - epoch vlbi results to be presented for this source .",
    "the results for 1es  1959 + 650 and pks  2155@xmath0304 are combined with earlier results for these sources from paper i to yield a longer time baseline for measurement .",
    "the major observational findings for these three sources are :    1 .",
    "h  1426 + 428 s parsec - scale structure during this time range was well - modeled by a @xmath1mjy core and a single @xmath2mjy jet component at a position angle of approximately @xmath46 , with an apparent speed of @xmath3 .",
    "2 .   1es  1959 + 650 consisted of a compact core and a nearby stationary ( @xmath4 ) jet component at a position angle of about @xmath114 and a separation of about 0.35 mas at 15 ghz . on larger scales of a few mas the jet is diffuse and directed to the north , so that this source shows an extreme apparent misalignment of about @xmath115 on parsec scales .",
    "3 .   pks  2155@xmath0304 was observed with dual - circular polarization at 15 ghz . the fractional polarization at the position of the core was 3% , and the electric vector position angle was @xmath78 , about @xmath79 misaligned from the innermost jet position angle .",
    "the measured apparent speed of the single jet component was @xmath5 .",
    "we combined the new apparent speed measurements from this paper with the apparent speeds measured in tev blazar jets from our earlier papers to form a current set of apparent speed measurements in tev hbls ( table  [ speedtab ] ) .",
    "the mean peak apparent pattern speed in the jets of the tev hbls is about 1@xmath6 .",
    "the statistical result noted in paper i that the tev hbls have significantly slower apparent jet pattern speeds compared to radio - selected or gev - selected blazars is strengthened by the new results of this paper .",
    "the discussion section ( @xmath11  [ disc ] ) presented a thorough analysis of these results in the context of other radio observations and theoretical models for tev blazar jets .",
    "conclusions from that analysis were :    1 .",
    "the peak apparent speeds of order 0.5 - 2@xmath6 in four of the six studied tev blazars ( table  [ speedtab ] ) , when taken together with other observed radio properties discussed in @xmath11  [ disc ] , are consistent with radio jets with bulk lorentz factors of @xmath110 and viewing angles of a few degrees . 2 .",
    "the very slow peak apparent speeds in two of the six studied tev blazars in table  [ speedtab ] ( mkn  421 and 1es1959 + 650 ) are likely pattern speeds that are unrelated to the bulk apparent speeds of the jets , which are likely to be similar to those mentioned above .",
