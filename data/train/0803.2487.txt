    "a smooth vector field @xmath0 on a riemannian manifold @xmath1 can be seen as a map into its tangent bundle endowed with the sasaki metric , @xmath2 , defined by @xmath3 .",
    "the volume of @xmath0 is the volume of @xmath4 considered as a submanifold of @xmath5 .",
    "analogously , we can define the energy of @xmath0 as the energy of the map @xmath6 and if @xmath7 is another metric on @xmath8 , we define the generalized energy @xmath9 as the energy of @xmath10 .",
    "these energies were introduced in @xcite to study the relationship between the energy and the volume of vector fields . in particular ,",
    "if we take either @xmath11 or @xmath12 , the generalized energy turns out to be , up to constant factors , the energy and the volume of the vector field respectively .    on a compact manifold @xmath8 , the critical points of all these functionals should be parallel with respect to the levi - civita connection defined by @xmath3 , so it is usual to restrict the functionals to the submanifold of unit vector fields . obviously , if @xmath8 admits unit parallel vector fields , they are the absolute minimizers .",
    "the geometrically simplest manifolds admitting unit vector fields but not parallel ones are odd - dimensional spheres .",
    "hopf vector fields defined as those tangent to the fibres of the hopf fibration @xmath13 are very special unit vector fields .",
    "when both manifolds are endowed with their usual metrics , this map is a riemannian submersion with totally geodesic fibres whose tangent space is generated by the unit vector field @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the unit normal to the sphere and @xmath16 is the usual complex structure of @xmath17 .    in @xcite ,",
    "gluck and ziller showed that hopf vector fields on the @xmath18-dimensional round spheres are the absolute minimizers of the volume and the analogous result for the energy was shown by brito in @xcite . for higher dimension , they are unstable critical points of the energy ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "all these results are independent of the radius of the sphere , but as concerns the stability as critical points of the volume , borrelli and gil - medrano showed in @xcite that for each @xmath19 there exists a critical value of the radius , such that , hopf vector fields are stable critical points of the volume if and only if the radius is lower than or equal to this critical radius . by stable",
    "we mean that the hessian of the functional is positive semi - definite .    in order to understand better these phenomena , in @xcite gil - medrano and the author studied",
    "the behaviour of the hopf vector field with respect to the volume and the energy when the metric considered on the sphere is the canonical variation of the riemannian submersion given by the hopf fibration .",
    "the metrics so constructed are known as berger metrics , they consist in a @xmath20-parameter variation @xmath21 for @xmath22 . when @xmath23 , the new metric is riemannian and if @xmath24 , the metric is lorentzian and @xmath25 is timelike",
    ". moreover , they also studied the subset of @xmath26 of pairs @xmath27 such that the vector field @xmath28 is stable as a critical point of the generalized energy @xmath29 on the spheres of dimension greater than three .",
    "the dimension three was studied in @xcite .    in riemannian berger spheres , the problem of determining the behaviour of hopf vector fields",
    "is completely solved for the energy and the volume , but as concerns the generalized energy @xmath29 , there exist values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 for which the stability of hopf vector fields is still an open problem . for lorentzian berger spheres , the technique used to show stability in the riemannian case does not allow us to conclude the stability in any case and only a partial result concerning the instability is shown in @xcite .",
    "these instability results , as in the riemannian case , have been obtained computing the hessian in the direction of the vector fields @xmath32 for all @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "these vector fields can be seen as the projection onto @xmath35 of the gradient of an eigenfunction associated to the first eigenvalue of the laplacian of the sphere .    in this work , we construct new directions using the simultaneous eigenfunctions of the laplacian and of the vertical laplacian @xmath36 of the sphere .",
    "more precisely , we consider vector fields @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a polynomial of degree @xmath39 in @xmath40 such that its restriction to the sphere is a simultaneous eigenfunction of the laplacian and of the vertical laplacian . here",
    "these vector fields verify that @xmath42 and they allow us to prove in section @xmath18 that _ on lorentzian berger spheres , the hopf vector fields @xmath28 are unstable critical points of the energy , the volume and the generalized energy @xmath29 for all @xmath43_. the eigenfunctions of @xmath44 have been also used to study , for example , the harmonic index and nullity of the hopf map ( see @xcite ) .    in section @xmath45 , we use the ideas introduced in the previous section to complete the results in @xcite and then we solve completely the problem of determining the stability of hopf vector fields with respect to the generalized energy @xmath29 in the riemannian berger @xmath18-sphere . in particular , we prove that _ if @xmath46 and @xmath47 , or if @xmath48 and @xmath49 , then @xmath28 is an unstable critical point of @xmath29_. again , we need to consider vector fields more complicated that the vectors fields @xmath50 .",
    "so , the simultaneous eigenfunctions of the laplacian and of the vertical laplacian play an important role in the resolution of these problems in the sphere . for spheres of upper dimension",
    ", we can use the vector fields @xmath51 to improve the results in @xcite concerning the generalized energy , but it is not sufficient to solve completely the problem .",
    "given a riemannian manifold @xmath1 , the sasaki metric @xmath2 on the tangent bundle @xmath52 is defined , using @xmath3 and its levi - civita connection @xmath53 , as follows : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the projection and @xmath56 is the connection map of @xmath53 .",
    "we will consider also its restriction to the tangent sphere bundle , obtaining the riemannian manifold @xmath57    as in @xcite , for each metric @xmath7 on @xmath8 we can define the generalized energy of the vector field @xmath0 , denoted @xmath58 , as the energy of the map @xmath59 that is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the endomorphism determined by @xmath62 .",
    "this energy can also be written as @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are defined by @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively . by the definition of the sasaki metric , @xmath68 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath11 @xmath69 this functional is known as the energy and will be represented by @xmath70 .",
    "its relevant part , @xmath71 , is known as the total bending of @xmath0 and its restriction to unit vector fields has been widely studied by wiegmink in @xcite , ( see also @xcite ) .    on the other hand , the volume of a vector field @xmath0 is defined as the @xmath72-dimensional volume of the submanifold @xmath4 of @xmath73 .",
    "it is given by    @xmath74    since for @xmath75 we have @xmath76 , then ( [ energiag ] ) and ( [ volumen ] ) give @xmath77 the first variation of the generalized energy has been computed in @xcite . it has been also shown there that @xmath0 is a critical point of @xmath78 if and only if @xmath0 is a critical point of @xmath79 and that , on a compact @xmath8 , a critical vector field of any of these generalized energies should be parallel .",
