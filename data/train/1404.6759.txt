    "habitat selection by individuals impacts key attributes of a population including its spatial distribution , temporal fluctuations in its abundance , and its genetic composition . in environmentally heterogeneous landscapes ,",
    "individuals selecting more favorable habitats are more likely to survive or reproduce .",
    "as population densities increase in these habitats , individuals may benefit by selecting previously unused habitats .",
    "thus , both environmental conditions and density - dependent feedbacks generate selective pressures on habitat selection . under equilibrium conditions ,",
    "spatial heterogeneity can select for populations exhibiting an ideal - free distribution ",
    "equal per - capita growth rates in all occupied patches and lower per - capita growth rates if individuals moved into unoccupied patches  @xcite . under non - equilibrium conditions ,",
    "spatial - temporal heterogeneity can select for individuals occupying sink habitats in which the per - capita growth rate is always negative  @xcite .",
    "environmental heterogeneity can also promote coexistence of genotypes only differing in their habitat choices  @xcite . despite significant advances in the mathematical theory for habitat selection under equilibrium conditions , a mathematical theory for habitat selection in stochastic environments",
    "is largely lacking . here",
    ", we take a step to addressing this mathematical shortfall while at the same gaining new insights into the evolution of habitat selection for populations living in stochastic , patchy environments .    since the classic paper @xcite",
    ", the ideal - free distribution has been studied extensively from empirical , theoretical , and mathematical perspectives .",
    "empirical support for ideal - free distributions exists for many taxa including fish  @xcite , birds  @xcite , mammals  @xcite , and insects  @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite found that armored catfish in panamanian stream pools were distributed such that the resource availability per catfish was equal in all occupied pools , despite significant variation in light availability across these occupied pools .",
    "theoreticians have identified several `` non - ideal '' mechanisms ( e.g. sedentarism , adaptive movement with finite speed , density - dependent dispersal ) that , under equilibrium conditions , generate an ideal - free distribution  @xcite .",
    "for example , at equilibrium , sedentary populations achieve an ideal - free distribution provided , paradoxically , the populations initially occupied all habitat patches .",
    "while many early studies asserted that the ideal free distribution is an evolutionarily stable strategy ( ess )  @xcite , only recent advanced nonlinear analyses fully verified this assertion  @xcite .    in nature ,",
    "observed habitat occupancies are frequently less extreme than predicted by the ideal - free distribution : individuals underuse higher quality habitats and overuse lower quality habitats compared to theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "notably , populations occupying sink habitats have been documented in many species  @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for these observations is that populations experience temporal as well as spatial variation in environmental conditions and , consequently , theory based on equilibrium assumptions tells an incomplete story . in support of this explanation",
    ", several theoretical studies have shown that occupation of sink habitats should evolve when temporal variation is sufficiently great in other habitats  @xcite .",
    "these theoretical developments , however , rely on linearizations of density - dependent models , and do not analyze the dynamics of competing genotypes , the ultimate basis for evolutionary change due to natural selection .",
    "hence , these studies leave unanswered the question , `` does the linear analysis correctly identify competitive exclusion in pairwise interactions that is the basis for the analysis of evolutionarily stable strategies ? ''    within populations , individuals can exhibit different habitat selection strategies , and there is some evidence these differences can be genetically based  @xcite . for instance , some individuals of the fruit fly species _ drosophila tripunctata _ prefer tomato host plants ( one potential habitat for its larvae ) while others prefer mushrooms ( another potential habitat ) , and these differences are based on two genetically independent traits , settling behavior and ovipositor site preference  @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that genetic variation in habitat selection is common , especially in arthropods and mollusks .",
    "furthermore , they demonstrated using mathematical models that this genetic variation can stem from density - dependent regulation occurring locally within each habitat . specifically , jaenike and holt write `` frequency - dependent selection favors alleles that confer upon their carriers a preference for underused habitats , even if there is no genetic variation in how well individuals are adapted to the different habitat '' @xcite .",
    "their analysis , however , does nt account for temporal fluctuations in environmental conditions and this raises the question , `` does environmental stochasticity facilitate or hinder the maintenance of genetic variation in habitat selection ? ''    to answer the aforementioned questions , we provide an in - depth analysis of a model introduced in @xcite .",
    "the single genotype ( i.e. monomorphic ) version of this model and a characterization of its dynamics are given in section 2 .",
    "the competing genotype ( i.e. dimorphic ) version of the model and invasion rates of each genotype when rare are introduced in section 3 . in section 4 , we prove that these invasion rates determine the long - term fate of each of the genotypes . specifically , if both genotypes have positive invasion rates when rare , then there is a positive stationary distribution under which the genotypes coexist . alternatively ,",
    "if one genotype has a negative invasion rate when rare , then it is asymptotically displaced by the other genotype .",
    "these result allows us to use the invasion rates when rare to explore conditions supporting a protected polymorphism for habitat selection . in section 5 , we refine the characterization of an evolutionary stable strategy for habitat selection from @xcite in a mathematically rigorous manner , and provide an explicit formula for this ess when there are two habitat types .",
    "section 6 concludes with a discussion of how our results relate to the existing literature and identifies future challenges for the theory of habitat selection in stochastic environments .",
    "to set the stage for two competing populations spread over several patches , we start with a single population living in one patch . let @xmath0 be the population abundance at time @xmath1 .",
    "the stochastic process @xmath2 is governed by the it stochastic logistic equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the intrinsic rate of growth of the population in the absence of stochasticity , @xmath5 is the strength of intraspecific competition , @xmath6 is the infinitesimal variance parameter of the stochastic growth rate , and @xmath7 is a standard brownian motion . the process @xmath8 is a strong markov process with continuous paths .",
    "we call an object with such properties a _ diffusion_.    as shown in our first proposition , the process @xmath8 lives in the positive half line @xmath9 ; that is , if we start it in a strictly positive state , then it never hits zero . furthermore , the long - term behavior of the process is determined by the stochastic rate of growth @xmath10 .",
    "when the stochastic growth rate is negative the population abundance converges asymptotically to zero with probability one . on the other hand ,",
    "when this parameter is positive the distribution of the abundance converges to an equilibrium given by a gamma distribution .",

    "we further couple the population dynamics across patches by assuming the fraction of population in patch @xmath30 equals @xmath43 for all time .",
    "this spatial distribution can be realized at the scale of the individual when , as described in greater detail in remark  [ r : prelimiting ] , individuals disperse rapidly and independently of one another in such a manner that the fraction of time spent in patch @xmath30 equals @xmath43 for each individual . under this assumption , we call @xmath44 , with @xmath45 for all @xmath46 and @xmath47 , a * patch - selection strategy*. continuing to denote the abundance of the population in the @xmath30-th patch at time @xmath1 as @xmath31 , we have @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the total population abundance at time @xmath1 .",

    "indeed , in the words of the eminent evolutionary biologist ernst mayr , `` with habitat and food selection  behavioral phenomena  playing a major role in the shift into new adaptive zones , the importance of behavior in initiating new evolutionary events is self - evident '' @xcite . here",
    ", we examined how spatial and temporal heterogeneity in demographic rates across multiple habitat patches influence the dynamics of competing populations who only differ in their habitat patch selection preferences .",
    "we assume that habitat selection has a genetic basis ( e.g. genes that influence the physiological or neurological capacity of individuals to detect and respond to habitat cues ) and that genetic differences in habitat choice have no pleiotropic effects on habitat specific fitness .",
    "our analysis reveals that , generically , only two outcomes are possible , coexistence or displacement of one population by the other for all initial conditions , and that these outcomes are determined by the invasion rates of populations when rare .",
    "in addition to providing a mathematically rigorous justification of prior work , our analysis provides new insights into protected polymorphisms for habitat selection and raises several questions about evolutionary stable strategies for habitat selection .",
    "protected polymorphisms correspond to populations of competing genotypes exhibiting negative frequency - dependence : each population tends to increase when rare  @xcite . in the case of patch selection ,",
    "these competing populations differ in the frequencies in which they select habitat patches . in a survey of the empirical literature",
    ", @xcite found `` that genetic variation for habitat selection is common , especially in arthropods and mollusks , the groups that have been studied most frequently . '' moreover , they argued that some of this variation may be maintained through protected polymorphism .",
    "specifically , `` in a haploid model without intrinsic fitness differences among genotypes [ i.e. soft selection ] , genetic variation in fixed habitat preferences may be maintained stably '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "we provide a general analytic criterion ( see , inequality ) characterizing these protected polymorphisms for spatially and temporally variable environments .",
    "this criterion depends on the intrinsic fitnesses ( @xmath211 and @xmath212 ) of each population and their competitive coefficients ( @xmath275 and @xmath276 ) that characterize the effect of each population on the other .",
    "competitive effects are greatest when there is an overlap in patch use and one population tends to select the patches with the higher carrying capacities more than the other population .",
    "intuitively , by occupying patches with a larger carrying capacities , populations achieve higher regional densities .",
    "coupled with overlap in patch use , these higher densities result in a greater competitive impact of one population on another .",
    "a protected polymorphism occurs when the relative fitness of each population ( e.g. @xmath277 for strategy @xmath59 ) is greater than the competitive effect of the other population on it ( e.g. @xmath278 for the population playing strategy @xmath59 ) .",
    "hence , as in the case of species coexistence  @xcite , protected polymorphism are most likely when fitness differences are small ( i.e. @xmath279 ) and competitive effects are small ( i.e. both @xmath275 and @xmath280 ) . environmental stochasticity solely effects the intrinsic fitness terms and can facilitate or inhibit protected polymorphisms . for landscapes in which all patches experience the same degree of uncorrelated , temporal variation , environmental stochasticity has an inhibitory effect as it magnifies fitness differences between competing strategies ( e.g. @xmath277 increases with environmental stochasticity ) .",
    "for asymmetric landscapes , however , temporal variability can facilitate polymorphisms by reducing fitness differences of competing strategies .",
    "in contrast to protected polymorphisms , our analysis reveals that populations playing an evolutionarily stable strategy ( ess ) for patch selection not only thwart invasion attempts by all other strategies but also can invade and displace a population playing any other strategy .",
    "furthermore , our analysis provides a mathematically rigorous justification of an earlier characterization of esss  @xcite .",
    "this characterization implies that populations playing the ess always occupy source habitats ( i.e. patches where @xmath281 ) .",
    "indeed , consider a population playing strategy @xmath59 that does not occupy some source patch , say patch @xmath30 .",
    "then a different behavioral genotype @xmath142 that only selects patch @xmath30 can invade as @xmath282 . in the limiting case of a deterministic environment",
    ", our characterization of the ess recovers the classic result of @xcite : the fraction of time spent in a patch is proportional to the carrying capacity of the patch . adding environmental stochasticity generally results in populations playing the ess decreasing the time spent in the patches with larger carrying capacities and possibly making use of sink patches ( i.e. patches where @xmath283 ) .",
    "this shift in patch choice can be viewed as a spatial form of bet hedging : individuals increase fitness by decreasing the variance in their stochastic growth rate at the expense of their mean growth rate  @xcite .",
    "we are able to show that for two patch landscapes there always exists an ess for patch selection",
    ". however , several questions remain unanswered .",
    "first , what happens for landscapes with more than two patches ? is there always an ess ?",
    "second , while we know that a population playing an ess can displace a monomoprhic population playing a different strategy , can it displace polymorphic populations ?",
    "finally , are esss always convergently stable  @xcite ?",
    "if there are positive answers to this final suite of questions , then esss can be generally viewed as the ultimate evolutionary end state for patch selection strategies .",
    "going beyond the models considered here , studying the evolution habitat use faces many challenges .",
    "our models assume that populations spend a fixed fraction of time in each patch and do so instantaneously . what happens if we relax these assumptions ?",
    "for example , if populations are more ideal and able to track changes in population density instantaneously , then we have something closer to the classical notion of ideal free movement  @xcite . for these populations ,",
    "what is the optimal ( in an evolutionary sense ) density - dependent strategy ?",
    "moreover , can such a strategy displace the static strategies considered here ? alternatively , if populations are less ideal and diffusing randomly on the landscape , what happens then ?",
    "the linear version of this question was tackled in part by @xcite . however , the mathematical analysis for analogous stochastic models with density - dependent feedbacks is largely unexplored . going beyond single species , the coevolution of patch selection among interacting species has a rich history for spatially heterogeneous , but temporally homogeneous environments  @xcite .",
    "for example , spatial heterogeneity can select for the evolution of contrary choices in which the prey prefers low quality patches to escape the predator and the predator prefers high quality patches to capture higher quality food items  @xcite . understanding how environmental stochastic influences this coevolution of patch choice and the community level consequences of these coevolutionary outcomes provides a plethora of important , yet largely untouched challenges for future work .",
