    "the kondo model , proposed by jun kondo in 1964  @xcite , describes the interaction of a single magnetic impurity with the fermionic quasi - particles of a landau fermi liquid ( lfl ) .",
    "the kondo hamiltonian includes two terms : a kinetic term for the lfl quasi - particles , and a kondo coupling between the lfl spin current and the impurity s spin .",
    "the kondo model was seminal in many respects .",
    "for example , the kondo coupling constant approaches zero in the ultraviolet ( uv ) , appears to diverge at a dynamically - generated scale and in the infrared ( ir ) , conventionally expressed as a temperature , the kondo temperature , @xmath9 .",
    "the kondo model thus provided an example of asymptotic freedom and dimensional transmutation pre - dating quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) by almost ten years .",
    "moreover , the kondo model was seminal to wilson s development of ( numerical ) renormalization group ( rg ) techniques  @xcite , integrability  @xcite , large-@xmath0 limits  @xcite , conformal field theory ( cft ) techniques  @xcite , and more  @xcite .",
    "the `` kondo problem '' is to find the eigenstates of the kondo hamiltonian for all values of temperature @xmath10 , and from them to compute all observables .",
    "the kondo problem is considered solved , via a combination of the techniques mentioned above .",
    "the solution reveals the `` kondo effect '' , that is , the screening of the impurity spin by the lfl when @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , the lfl quasi - particles form a screening cloud around the impurity , the `` kondo cloud '' , which at @xmath12 has a characteristic size , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fermi velocity . for a dilute concentration of magnetic impurities",
    ", the kondo effect leads to a characteristic @xmath15 contribution to the resistivity  @xcite . at @xmath16 ,",
    "perturbation theory breaks down .",
    "although the kondo problem is considered solved , many questions about the original kondo model actually remain very challenging , such as the the dependence of the entanglement entropy ( ee ) on the size of a spatial sub - system@xcite , the effect of a quantum quench of the kondo coupling @xcite , or how to define and measure @xmath17 precisely  @xcite .",
    "more generally , a major challenge is to solve the kondo problem when the lfl is replaced by strongly - interacting degrees of freedom , including in particular , in one spatial dimension , a luttinger liquid .",
    "the anti - de sitter / cft ( ads / cft ) correspondence  @xcite , also known as holography , may be uniquely well - suited to address many of these open questions .",
    "ads / cft equates a weakly - coupled theory of gravity in @xmath18-dimensional ads spacetime , @xmath19 , with a strongly - coupled @xmath20-dimensional cft `` living '' on the boundary of @xmath19 .",
    "typically the strongly - coupled cft is a non - abelian gauge theory in the t hooft large-@xmath0 limit  @xcite .",
    "various holographic impurity models have been proposed : see for example refs .",
    "@xcite . in all of these models ,",
    "the global @xmath21 spin symmetry is replaced by an @xmath22 , which is then gauged , that is , @xmath22 gauge fields were introduced , and possibly additional fields , such as supersymmetric partners of the gauge fields .",
    "the impurity is then described as an @xmath22 wilson line  @xcite .",
    "gauging @xmath22 introduces an additional coupling , the t hooft coupling .",
    "all of the models in refs .",
    "@xcite employed the t hooft large-@xmath0 limit and large t hooft coupling . in other words , all of the holographic models in refs .",
    "@xcite are strongly - interacting mean - field models .    however , most of the holographic models in @xcite describe only fixed points .",
    "indeed , only the holographic model of @xcite describes an rg flow with a kondo coupling that exhibites asymptotic freedom and the appearance of @xmath9 .",
    "the new aspects of @xcite include a holographic description of the flow from a uv to an ir fixed point triggered by a ` double - trace ' marginally relevant operator and a gravity dual of the screening mechanism .",
    "the essential difference between this holographic model and the original kondo model is that instead of the free electron gas , there is an inherently strongly coupled system which interacts with the magnetic impurity .",
    "moreover , just as in the models @xcite the gauge / gravity duality approach requires a large @xmath0 limit for the @xmath22 spin group in @xcite . due to this limit , the characteristic logarithmic rise of the resistivity at low temperatures is absent .",
    "instead , a leading irrelevant operator analysis shows that the resistivity scales with temperature as @xmath23 , @xmath24 being a real number greater than one .",
    "this is reminiscent of a luttinger liquid behaviour , and an interesting task for the future will be to determine the luttinger parameter for the holographic model proposed in @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath0 kondo model was studied in field theory ( with free electrons and a global @xmath22 spin group ) already some time ago @xcite . as was noted there , the model simplifies considerably by introducing slave fermions @xmath25 and writing the impurity spin operator @xmath26 as @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is a generator of @xmath22 in the fundamental representation .",
    "@xmath26 is in a totally antisymmetric representation , corresponding to a young tableau with @xmath29 boxes .",
    "the chiral fermions are constrained by the fact that their charge density has to be equal to @xmath29 .",
    "the crucial property of the large @xmath0 kondo model is that the screening corresponds to a condensation of the operator @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is an electron field and @xmath25 the slave fermion",
    ". the condensate breaks the @xmath32 symmetry of the electrons and slave fermions to the diagonal @xmath33 . in the large @xmath0 limit ,",
    "long - range fluctuations are suppressed , such that condensate formation is possible also in two dimensions .",
    "there is a phase transition at a critical temperature @xmath34 in the large @xmath0 kondo model , whereas for finite @xmath0 the transition is a crossover .",
    "this condensation has a very natural analogue in gauge / gravity duality , in the form of a holographic superconductor in ads@xmath35 .",
    "motivated by a top - down brane construction which realises the scalar dual to the operator @xmath30 as strings streching from d5 to d7-branes , in @xcite a bottom - up holographic kondo model was suggested , in which the electron current is dual to an ads@xmath36 chern - simons field @xmath37 , in addition to the scalar field dual to @xmath38 which lives on an ads@xmath35 subspace . moreover ,",
    "the charge density dual is given by the temporal component @xmath39 of a gauge field on ads@xmath35 .",
    "finite temperature is introduced by considering a btz black hole background instead of ads@xmath36 . in this model ,",
    "the defect rg flow is generated by the gravity dual of the product operator @xmath40 , which is obtained in analogy to the holographic double - trace deformation proposed in @xcite .",
    "this rg flow displays the required scale generation .",
    "moreover , at low energies @xmath38 condenses .",
    "this gives rise to a screening of the impurity , as may be checked by calculating the flux of @xmath39 in the ads@xmath35 subspace . at the boundary",
    ", this flux coincides with @xmath29 . at the horizon",
    ", this flux decreases when lowering the temperature , such that there are less impurity degrees of freedom visible .    in this paper , in view of providing further comparison with field theory results , we calculate the entanglement entropy for the model described above .",
    "the application of the ryu - takayanagi ( rt ) approach @xcite for the holographic entanglement entropy requires to include the effect of the backreaction of the ads@xmath35 hypersurface on the ads@xmath36 geometry . for a simple holographic model which describes the backreaction of the defect on the surrounding geometry , we follow @xcite and consider a hypersurface with the required matter content , i.e.  a two - dimensional gauge field and a complex scalar .",
    "the geometry is then determined by the israel junction conditions .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , these conditions are influenced by the energy conditions for the brane matter fields . in this paper , we will often refer to the hypersurface as `` brane '' , as it is the remnant of the intersection of the d5 and d7-branes studied in the top - down model of @xcite .",
    "the geometry remains btz everywhere except at the locus of this brane .",
    "the effect of the israel junction conditions is to cut out parts of the bulk volume , in dependence on the brane tension generated by the brane matter fields .",
    "we calculate the entanglement entropy in this geometry as follows : the field theory entangling region is an interval of length @xmath41 symmetrically located on both sides of the impurity .",
    "then , according to the ryu - takayanagi prescription , the entanglement entropy is given by the length of the bulk geodesic with endpoints coinciding with the endpoints of the boundary interval . via the israel junction conditions implementing the backreaction , the matter fields on the brane affect the length of this geodesic , and thus the entanglement entropy .    within field theory , the _ impurity entropy _",
    "is defined by the difference @xcite @xmath42 this quantity was argued to provide a good description of the kondo cloud profile @xcite .",
    "we use the same definition for the impurity entropy in our holographic computation .",
    "the subtraction guarantees a finite result in the holographic approach .",
    "a central result of our holographic calculation is that as the condensate @xmath43 increases , the spacetime volume shrinks .",
    "this results in shorter geodesics normal to the brane and hence in smaller impurity entropy .",
    "this is in agreement with field theory expectations , since in the large @xmath0 limit , the formation of the @xmath44 condensate corresponds to screening of the impurity .",
    "when the impurity is screened , less impurity degrees of freedom are visible , which is indeed the case in our holographic approach .",
    "this physical property is encoded in the @xmath1-theorem @xcite .",
    "indeed , our model adds one more example to the explicit realizations of boundary rg flows manifestly satisfying the @xmath1-theorem .",
    "a field theory example for such a flow may be found in @xcite . for further examples within holography ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we also note that our holographic map between the decrease of entanglement entropy and the decrease of volume in the dual gravity theory may be related to recent discussions of quantum complexity in the holographic context @xcite",
    ".    the agreement with field theory results may be made precise at least in the large @xmath45 and small @xmath10 limit .",
    "the impurity entropy was calculated both using density matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) and cft approaches @xcite for free electrons coupled to a magnetic impurity .",
    "the @xmath12 result is @xcite @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the central charge . in @xcite",
    "this result was generalised to small but non - zero temperature , @xmath48 we find that a similar result is obtained in the holographic approach , where the field theory is strongly coupled .",
    "this is achieved in the following way : an rg flow is given by the defect brane which reaches from the boundary to the horizon .",
    "since the energy - momentum tensor originating from the defect matter fields varies as function of the radial coordinate , the brane bends .",
    "it asymptotes to a constant tension brane in the uv near the boundary , i.e.  the energy - momentum tensor on the brane corresponds to constant tension .",
    "near the horizon , the energy - momentum tensor on the brane also asymptotes to constant tension form , however with a different tension than in the uv .",
    "this corresponds to an ir fixed point .",
    "we consider a geometric linear perturbation about this fixed point by fitting a constant tension brane to the asymptotic behaviour of the brane at the horizon . extrapolating this constant tension brane to the uv , it intersects the ads boundary at a distance @xmath49 from the impurity , see figure [ fig::fittedbranesimple ] .",
    "the impurity entropy then takes the form @xmath50 with @xmath51 the ryu - takayanagi entanglement entropy for the btz black hole .",
    "expanding to linear order in @xmath49 , we recover the field theory result provided that we identify @xmath52 i.e. @xmath49 plays the role of the kondo correlation length .",
    "this remarkable agreement may be traced back to the fact that in both field theory and holography , perturbation about a cft at an ir fixed point is involved , which induces universal behaviour independently of the precise form of the theory at the fixed point .",

    "do our numerical results verify this claim ? in order to answer this question , we first have to discuss how much the temperature can rise before the behaviour is lost .",

    "the detailed argument for this is as follows .",
    "due to the null energy condition ( nec ) , @xmath232 of can only increase along the boundary rg flow from the uv to the ir , i.e.  @xmath240 decreases . moreover , due to the violation of the strong energy condition ( sec ) , we will always have @xmath274 . from this",
    "we derive that @xmath275 this equation is easily understood from figure [ fig::fittedbrane ] : the interval @xmath276 is shorter than the @xmath277-interval defined by the point where the brane solution ( in solid green ) meets the horizon . in turn , this interval is smaller than the @xmath277-interval defined by the point where the uv constant tension brane ( in red , dashed ) meets the horizon .",
    "as explained in section [ sec::g ] , the quantity @xmath278 in has a very simple physical interpretation : it is half the length of the additional piece of event horizon that we obtain in the normal phase as compared to the btz black hole case without impurity ( see footnote [ footnote123 ] ) . in particular , as explained in the previous subsection it is related to the impurity entropy in the normal phase by @xmath279 from and , it follows that @xmath280 where @xmath138 here denotes the electric flux defined in section [ sec::kondo ] . in our numerics , we set @xmath281 , @xmath282 and @xmath148 , hence @xmath283 a number featuring prominently in figures [ fig::backreaction ] , [ fig::simp ] and [ fig::lng ] .",
    "this is now very important : @xmath270 may initially grow linearly with @xmath10 as in , but if it is bounded from above by @xmath284 , this means that this linear behaviour has to stop ( most likely long ) before a temperature @xmath285 is reached where @xmath286 .",
    "the value of @xmath285 depends on the slope of the initial linear increase .",
    "if we assume for small @xmath287 that @xmath288 , our estimate is that the linear behaviour of @xmath270 can under no circumstances be expected to be seen above @xmath289 were we have used and by comparison with we have set @xmath290 .",
    "as this is only a bound , the linear behaviour may already end at a temperature orders of magnitude lower than this , see also figure [ fig::dvst ] .",

    "this applies in particular to the exponential falloff following from the field theory result .",
    "these arguments are analytical and only dependent on general geometric properties of our model ( such as the btz background geometry that implies ) .",
    "this indicates that our approach of approximating the curved brane of our holographic model by a constant tension brane near the event horizon ( figure [ fig::fittedbrane ] ) corresponds to a linear perturbation about the ir fixed point .",
    "for this reason , we expect the results and , where the necessary approximations are valid , also to be examples for universal behaviour of holographic models of ads@xmath36/bcft@xmath35 duality involving thin branes @xcite , beyond the specific kondo model studied here .",
    "furthermore , it became apparent that while the _ coth _ terms in , agreed exactly in their respective arguments , we did not find even qualitative agreement of the prefactors of the _ coth _ term , as far as their dependence on temperature is concerned , see figure [ fig::dvst ] .",
    "in fact , we ended the section by showing that even if there _ were _ an agreement of these prefactors , it could only be manifest at very low temperatures , lower than what we were able to study numerically .",
    "we believe that the argument we used to show this is interesting in its own right : while the equations , were clearly derived under the assumption of low temperature ( @xmath291 ) , we did not specify what `` low '' means quantitatively in this context . however , in we derived a bound on this _ low _ temperature behaviour .",

    "the main question of the @xmath12 case is : will our system flow to a conformal fixed point ? in our ads",

    "where , as @xmath127 behaves as @xmath298 , we can additionally show that @xmath299 , @xmath300 and @xmath39 have to approach zero faster than @xmath301 .",

    "unfortunately , from and our reasoning below this equation , we can actually deduce that all the other terms in go to zero strictly faster than @xmath306 for large @xmath109 .",
    "this contradiction leads to two conclusions : first , for our simple model with potential @xmath308 the equations of motion seem to forbid the existence of an ir fixed point in our model .",

    "differences between these two models would then only become apparent at low temperatures when the scalar field @xmath199 grows in the bulk so that the higher order terms in the potential become important .",
    "for now , we leave the study of a model with a more complicated potential for future research and continue to summarise the results obtained with our original simple holographic kondo model as studied in @xcite .",
    "let us recapitulate the main results of this paper .",
    "in section [ sec::numericalresults ] we have presented numerical results on the impurity entropy in the holographic model of the kondo effect that was studied in @xcite as summarised in section [ sec::kondo ] .",
    "we discussed how several qualitative features resulted straightforwardly from arguments concerning the bulk geometry based on the energy conditions that are satisfied or violated by the matter - content of the bulk model .",
    "in particular , we found a qualitative geometrical dual gravity picture demonstrating how the kondo cloud acts as a screening cloud hiding the impurity . from the field theory side it is expected @xcite that due to the boundary rg flow",
    ", the impurity effectively looses degrees of freedom along the rg flow from the uv to the ir .",
    "this corresponds to the screening . in our holographic model ,",
    "there are three clear properties that we interpret to correspond to this : first , the flux of the yang - mills field @xmath78 is decreasing when moving along the brane from the uv to the ir .",
    "this was studied in detail in @xcite for the case without backreaction and qualitatively carries over to our numerical solutions as well .",
    "second , we find that due to the null energy condition ( nec ) the renormalised volume of our bulk spacetime is reduced for decreasing temperature , a feature that may be interpreted as a reduced holographic complexity , see @xcite .",
    "third , the reduction of the impurity entropy both with decreasing @xmath10 and increasing @xmath45 is a clear sign of the screening of the impurity .",
    "this was formalised in section [ sec::g ] in form of the holographic @xmath1-theorem @xcite that has attracted interest in holographic research before @xcite . due to the proof given in @xcite , it came as no surprise that we found the @xmath1-theorem to be satisfied by our explicit example , specifically as a consequence of the nec being satisfied by the matter fields in our holographic model .    in section [ sec::largel ]",
    "we derived an analytical approximation formula to our numerical results valid for large entanglement interval sizes @xmath45 .",
    "this made it possible to compare our results to similar field theory results that are summarised in the introduction , with remarkable agreement .",
    "indeed , the generality of the construction employed in section [ sec::largel ] led us to view this as a geometrical bulk manifestation of the universality of perturbing about an ir fixed point , at least to first order . for systems that can be described by a constant tension ( bulk )",
    "solution at @xmath12 in the ads / bcft approach@xcite , we found that an impurity length scale ( @xmath313 in the case of our kondo model ) can be identified with a geometrical bulk length @xmath49 as defined in figure [ fig::fittedbrane ] . in comparing gravity and field theory results ,",
    "the significance of the small - temperature behaviour of our model became apparent .",
    "there are many open questions related to impurities in strongly coupled systems .",
    "the results of the present paper , which provide a new link between the impurity entropy and defects in spacetime geometry , may be applied in a number of different scenarios . in the immediate holographic context ,",
    "we note the papers @xcite , where vortices in holographic superfluids were considered as defects in a 2 + 1-dimensional cft .",
    "also in that case , the theory flows to a non - trivial fixed point in the ir : at low energies , the vortex corresponds to a conformal defect interacting with the gapless modes in the superfluid .    for kondo or similar impurity systems ,",
    "entanglement entropy is not the only measure of entanglement , others such as rnyi entropies and entanglement negativity ( to only name a few ) have been studied in @xcite .",
    "how to study these measures of entanglement in our holographic kondo model is an interesting task that we leave to the future .",
    "the results of @xcite for the two - impurity kondo model are especially interesting in the light of the recent generalisation @xcite of the holographic kondo model @xcite to the two - impurity case . following the direction of research begun in @xcite ,",
    "it would of course also be interesting to study spatially separated impurities and kondo lattices .",
    "moreover , it will also be interesting to analyse the case of zero temperature .",
    "this may be compared to condensed matter results , as for instance in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the kondo effect was recently discussed in the context of qcd @xcite , where it was found to occur in light quark matter which contains heavy quarks as impurities .",
    "it will be illuminating to compare the qcd kondo model with the holographic one discussed here .    in view of the new recent interaction between gauge / gravity duality and quantum information theory",
    ", we note that the kondo model was studied in the mera approach for instance in @xcite . here our model , which links the removal of points from the geometry to the decrease of information , may also prove useful .",
    "indeed in sections [ sec::numericalresults ] and [ sec::summ ] we pointed out that the screening of the impurity by the kondo cloud might manifest itself not only in the entanglement or impurity entropy , but also in a quantity referred to as holographic complexity @xcite . it  will certainly be interesting to study this in more detail , calculating the holographic ( impurity- ) complexity numerically and investigating its behaviour under the boundary rg flow .",
    "one interesting question might be whether the holographic @xmath1-theorem can be phrased in terms of complexity instead of entanglement entropy .",

    "here , we derive the junction conditions that govern the interaction of our ( abelian ) bulk chern - simons field with the brane worldvolume current . as for the israel junction conditions of the gravitational field ,",
    "this can be done in different ways .",
    "we consider the case that the current is smoothed out as described below , such that after taking a well - defined limit it becomes a delta distribution . for a related study of the behaviour of chern - simons fields in the presence of domain walls ,",
    "see @xcite .    later on",
    ", we will phrase our junction conditions in a manifestly gauge and coordinate invariant way , such that our results can be readily applied to the kondo model .",
    "however , for now assume that we work in a gaussian normal coordinate system , such that the brane is located at @xmath209 . in our kondo model , the current involving the charged scalar @xmath314 on the brane worldvolume takes the form @xmath315 which in the static case can be written as @xmath316 in radial gauge . the brane is now assumed to be smoothed out by a profile satisfying @xmath317 , such that there exists a limit in which @xmath318 , @xmath319 . and",
    "@xmath320 and take the limit @xmath321 . ] see figure [ fig::current ] for the setup .",
    "> 018inkscape -z -d file = current_latexed.svg export - pdf = current_latexed.pdf export - latex    as we assume a static situation , all objects are independent of the coordinate @xmath322 . with the cs equation of motion",
    "@xmath323 the only non - trivial equation of motion then reads @xmath324 where we define the worldvolume @xmath325-tensor by contracting the bulk @xmath325-tensor with the normal form of the brane . in gaussian",
    "normal coordinates , this simply means @xmath326 .",
    "equation can be solved in two ways :    [ [ gauge - a_x0 ] ] gauge @xmath327 : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    first we assume @xmath327 , hence @xmath328    in the limit @xmath329 this means that the parallel component of the cs field has a discontinuity proportional to the charge density @xmath330 on the brane .    [ [ gauge - a_z0 ] ] gauge @xmath331 : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    if we assume @xmath331 instead , we find @xmath332 where @xmath333 denotes the levi - civita symbol , which is related to the levi - civita tensor by @xmath334 . in the limit",
    "@xmath329 we see that in this gauge , the component of the chern - simons field normal to the brane acquires a contribution @xmath335 .",
    "both approaches are indeed gauge - equivalent .",
    "this may be seen by explicitly showing that the difference of both solutions and is a total derivative @xmath336 with @xmath337 in the limit in which the current distribution becomes infinitely thin , this means that the gauge function @xmath338 approaches the heaviside @xmath339 function , and hence @xmath338 need not vanish for large @xmath340 .",
    "moreover , wilson lines transform in the appropriate way @xmath341 for a simple rectangular path such as @xmath138 in figure [ fig::current ] , we may explicitly calculate the wilson loop in the two gauges presented above and check that the results agree . by the equations of motion of the cs field",
    ", we find @xmath342 where @xmath343 denotes the interiour of @xmath138 .",
    "what we have learned above is that away from the brane on which the current @xmath344 is localised , the cs field satisfies its bulk ( vacuum ) equations of motion , while at the brane , depending on a gauge choice , we either have a discontinuity in the parallel component of the @xmath110-field or a @xmath345-peak in the normal component . in the former case ,",
    "the projection of the cs field to the brane worldvolume is not uniquely defined . for symmetry reasons",
    ", we assume that in equations , the scalar field @xmath75 couples to the _ mean value _ of the cs fields projected onto the brane from the left ( with projector @xmath346 ) and from the right ( with projector @xmath347 ) side of the bulk : @xmath348 in addition , we define the discontinuity of the parallel components at the brane by @xmath349 and the @xmath345-contribution to the normal component of the cs field by @xmath350 where @xmath351 is the normal form of the brane and the integral is along an integral curve of the vector field @xmath352 that crosses the brane at coordinates @xmath353 . taking the above results and definitions together",
    ", we then find that at the location of the brane , the cs field satisfies the junction condition @xmath354 let us comment on the interesting properties of this equation .",
    "first of all , we note that in the equations of motion of the scalar field and the yang - mills field , as well as in the current , only the projection @xmath355 as defined in plays a role , while the quantities @xmath356 and @xmath357 appear only on the right hand side of .",
    "furthermore , for given @xmath358 equation is an algebraic equation for @xmath356 and @xmath357 .",
    "this means that just as in @xcite the cs field decouples from the dynamics of the brane and we can first gauge @xmath359 in our setup , then solve for @xmath360 and @xmath358 and then solve the algebraic equation . finally , it is interesting to note the form of in which @xmath358 and hence the combination @xmath361 are gauge invariant by definition , such that the quantity @xmath357 acts as a gauge function for @xmath356 .",
    "here we briefly describe our method to solve the equations of motion - numerically .",
    "first of all we exploit two scaling symmetries of the eoms to set @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "all coordinates become dimensionless quantities : @xmath362 .",
    "the relationship between the matter action and the gravity action is fixed by @xmath363 . the electric flux defined in section [ sec::eoms ]",
    "is set to @xmath190 to be consistent with @xcite .",
    "the @xmath364-component of only contains first derivatives of the embedding function @xmath365 .",
    "it can be analytically solved for @xmath366 as a function of @xmath199 and @xmath39 as well as their derivatives .",
    "there are four solutions to this equation .",
    "however , only one of them is consistent with the background solution .",
    "we take this one and insert it into the equations of motion for @xmath199 and @xmath39 .",
    "these are now two coupled second order odes for two fields and hence require four boundary conditions .",
    "to solve them numerically , we apply the shooting method .",
    "we expand the fields at the asymptotic boundary ( @xmath367 , uv ) and at the horizon ( @xmath368 , i.e.  @xmath369 , ir ) .",
    "since the mass of the scalar is fine - tuned to saturate the breitenlohner - freedman bound , the uv expansions come along with roughly @xmath370 logarithms at @xmath371 order in @xmath218 : @xmath372 for this reason , expanding the fields in the uv using mathematica takes remarkably long and we were able to expand the fields only up to @xmath373 order in the uv . in the ir , we expand to @xmath374 order .",
    "@xmath29 is fixed by and our choice of @xmath375 and @xmath138 .",
    "regularity at the horizon fixes two more integration constants such that we are left with a one - parameter family of solutions , which we label by the value of the chemical potential @xmath376 . starting at the critical value @xmath377 , see below , we choose a set of increasing values of @xmath162 .",
    "for each of those we vary @xmath164 and @xmath165 and integrate the eoms numerically from the boundary to the horizon until the regularity conditions are satisfied .",
    "hence , each solution can also be referred to by @xmath159 and , by and , a value of @xmath287 .",
    "next , we define a set of radial positions between the conformal boundary and the horizon . for each position we obtain the embedding profiles @xmath196 by integrating numerically @xmath378 as a function of @xmath199 and @xmath39 , using the numerical solutions found by the shooting .",
    "we choose the integration constant such that @xmath379 , which is possible due to translational symmetry of the btz metric .",
    "we obtain numerical data in the form of @xmath380 for different @xmath218 , which can be mapped to a unique geodesic starting normal to the brane at @xmath381 and ending at the asymptotic boundary at @xmath382 and @xmath383 .",
    "the geodesics are regularised by subtracting the divergent term @xmath384 as we take the limit @xmath385 and have regularised ( dimensionless ) length @xmath386 , where we reintroduced the ads radius @xmath65 appearing in the line element .",
    "thus , starting at one position @xmath381 on the brane , we obtain data of the form @xmath387 . repeating this procedure for many starting points on the brane and for different @xmath162 ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath287 , we can interpolate a function @xmath386 .",
    "combined with , we obtain the entanglement entropy as a function of the subinterval around the impurity and the temperature .",
    "this is how we compute the first term in the definition of the impurity entropy .",

    "<S> there is an rg flow to an ir fixed point where the impurity is screened , leading to a decrease in impurity degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> this information loss corresponds to a volume decrease in our dual gravity model , which consists of a codimension one hypersurface embedded in a btz black hole background in three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> there are matter fields defined on this hypersurface which are dual to kondo field theory operators . in the large @xmath0 limit </S>",
    "<S> , the formation of the kondo cloud corresponds to the condensation of a scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> the entropy is calculated according to the ryu - takayanagi prescription . </S>",
    "<S> this requires to determine the backreaction of the hypersurface on the btz geometry , which is achieved by solving the israel junction conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the larger the scalar condensate gets , the more the volume of constant time slices in the bulk is reduced , shortening the bulk geodesics and reducing the impurity entropy . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a new non - trivial example of an rg flow satisfying the @xmath1-theorem . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find explicit expressions for the impurity entropy which are in agreement with previous field theory results for free electrons . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates the universality of perturbing about an ir fixed point .    _ </S>",
