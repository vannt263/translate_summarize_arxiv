    "while investigating the issues of _ quality of experience ( qoe ) _ , _ _ elasticity _ _ , and _ energy efficiency _ in next - generation optical access ( ngoa ) as part of research programs since 2009 @xcite with a major focus on the solutions beyond 10-gbit / s ethernet passive optical network ( 10g - epon ) and 10-gigabit - capable pon ( xg - pon ) ( e.g. , ng - pon2 @xcite by itu - t ) , we have noted that the progress in the clean - slate design of ngoa is impeded by the absence of a comprehensive research framework for a comparative analysis of candidate network architectures and protocols . in fact , many ngoa network architectures have been proposed by both academia and industry and are now under extensive study ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , most of the existing works lack a systematic comparison of these candidate architectures under realistic operating environments ; they are based on the comparison of network - level performances ( e.g. , packet delay and throughput ) , reaches , splitting ratios , and energy consumptions under static or limited statistical traffic configurations without taking into account the actual performances perceived by end - users that reflect the impact of higher - layer protocols including transmission control protocol ( tcp ) flow and congestion control .",
    "because of the complexity of protocols and the interactive nature of traffic involved in the study of network architectures , researchers now heavily depend on experiments with simulation models or test beds implementing proposed architectures and relevant protocols , rather than traditional mathematical analyses under simplifying assumptions . in this regard , a research framework for the comparative analysis of ngoa architectures and protocols should specify how to generate traffic and measure performances during the experiment , together with a systematic comparison of the measured performances from the experiments .",
    "note that , due to the shift toward experiments , comparison procedures should be able to take into account the statistical variability in measured data from the experiments .    in this paper a new research framework for the clean - slate design of ngoa architectures and protocols is proposed .",
    "the proposed research framework consists of two major components , i.e. , a comparative analysis framework and a virtual test bed for experiments .",
    "the comparative analysis framework is based on a multivariate non - inferiority testing procedure @xcite and a notion of equivalent circuit rate ( ecr ) @xcite . in this framework",
    "user - perceived performances of representative services  including web browsing ( i.e. , hypertext transfer protocol ( http ) ) , file downloading ( i.e. , file transfer protocol ( ftp ) ) , and streaming video ( i.e. , h.264/advanced video coding ( avc ) with user datagram protocol ( udp ) )  are compared in an integrated way using statistical hypothesis testing procedures .",
    "the virtual test bed is basically simulation models of the proposed architectures and protocols . unlike many existing works in the area of optical access that mainly focus on the issues up to the data link layer ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", the virtual test bed provides a complete experimental environment with session - level traffic generation ( based on user behaviors ) and performance gathering ( as measures for user - perceived performances ) as well as models for the whole network protocol stack ( including tcp / internet protocol ( ip ) ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : comparison_framework ] describes the comparative analysis framework based on the multivariate non - inferiority testing and the ecr .",
    "section [ sec : virtual_test_bed ] provides an overview of the current implementation of the virtual test bed and discusses plans and strategies for its improvement in the next version .",
    "section [ sec : preliminary_results ] presents results from the study of the elasticity of hybrid time division multiplexing ( tdm)/wavelength division multiplexing ( wdm)-pon to demonstrate the capability of the proposed research framework .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the discussions in this paper .",
    "[ fig : comparative_example ] illustrates an example of comparison between two delay curves at a certain value of load ( i.e. , @xmath0 ) , which is typical in the performance analysis of a new proposed system with respect to an existing one .    at first glance",
    ", the comparison seems straightforward ; one can say from the curves that the system b provides a lower delay than the system a at load @xmath0 .",
    "once taking into account the statistical variability in measured data ( i.e. , the overlapped confidence intervals in the enlarged part ) , however , we can find that the comparison is no longer straightforward and that a statistical approach is needed in this regard .",
    "note that most of the works in networking area lack a statistical approach in the performance comparison and just provide observations on certain trends .",
    "for example , `` the system b provides a better delay performance than the system a when the load is greater than @xmath0 '' is a typical observation for fig .",
    "[ fig : comparative_example ] , and the exact value of @xmath0 is not that critical .",
    "as we will discuss shortly in this section , however , the strict comparison of performances at a certain input value is quite critical to comparison frameworks like the ecr . also , considering other performance measures ( e.g. , throughput ) as well as delay curves for multiple services ( e.g. , http and ftp ) altogether ,",
    "the performance comparison between the systems becomes even more complicated .",
    "as we are at an early stage of the clean - slate design of ngoa , we therefore need to establish a new framework for comparing candidate network architectures and protocols which meets the following requirements :    * a comparison procedure should _ take into account the statistical variability _ in measured data resulting from the experiments . *",
    "multiple performance measures should be compared together _ in an integrated way_. * measures for the comparison should be _ user - oriented_. in other words , they should reflect the quality of experience ( qoe ) , rather than the quality of service ( qos ) .    to meet these requirements , we have been working on a new comparative analysis framework based on the non - inferiority testing for the comparison procedure and the ecr for the quantification of the resulting performance .",
    "the non - inferiority testing is a one - sided variant of the equivalence testing that is frequently used in medicine and biology for the establishment of the equivalence ( often called _ bioequivalence _ ) between two different clinical trials or drugs @xcite .",
    "the ecr , on the other hand , was originally proposed for the quantification of the bandwidth of hybrid fiber coaxial ( hfc ) cable - based shared access network with respect to that of the digital subscriber line ( dsl)-based dedicated access network in terms of web page delay as a measure for user - perceived performances @xcite .",
    "the ecr framework has been extended for a quantitative comparison of optical access architectures in @xcite .",
    "combining these two frameworks , we can meet the aforementioned requirements : the non - inferiority testing procedure is based on statistical hypothesis testing and as such takes into account the statistical variability inherent in measurements as well as experiments . to compare multiple performance measures in an integrated way",
    ", we extend the non - inferiority testing with the intersection - union testing ( iut ) as described in @xcite .",
    "the third requirement is met by the ecr which enables us to quantify the relative capacity of a candidate system with respect to a reference one based on user - perceived performances at the application level .",
    "[ fig : comparative_analysis_framework ] shows the comparative analysis framework based on the ecr for the investigation of ngoa architectures and protocols , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 denote backbone , feeder , distribution , and user network interface ( uni ) rates and @xmath5 the line rate connecting the optical line terminal ( olt ) and the optical network unit ( onu ) of a reference architecture .    in this framework",
    "we compare the user - perceived performances of both the candidate and the reference architectures and find the value of @xmath5 ( i.e. , ecr ) for the reference architecture which gives user - perceived performances statistically equivalent to those of the candidate architecture . in case of a shared architecture , for instance , because of contention for a feeder capacity among multiple onus and for a distribution capacity among multiple users connected to the same onu , each user s share of capacity can not be greater than the minimum of the feeder and the distribution capacities .",
    "therefore the user - perceived performance would be similar to that of the reference architecture with the line rate equal to or less than the minimum of the feeder and the distribution rates of the shared architecture .",
    "note that the original ecr framework @xcite is based on a single performance measure of web page delay and does not provide any systematic comparison procedure taking into account the statistical variability in measured data .",
    "[ fig : ecr_calculation ] shows the new procedure for calculating ecr based on multivariate non - inferiority testing ( i.e. , non - inferiority testing extended by the iut ) , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the number of performance measures adopted and the number of values for @xmath5 ( i.e. , @xmath8 s ) used for comparison , respectively .     + ( a )",
    "+ ( b )    first , we need to obtain measures of the user - perceived performances for representative applications / services ( i.e. , @xmath9 )  e.g. , web page delay defined as the average time taken to download an entire web page @xcite and the fraction of decodable frames per group of pictures ( gop ) ( also called `` decodable frame rate ( dfr ) '' ) for streaming video @xcite  of the reference architecture for the line rates of @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "s ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) and proper choice of their values . ]",
    "second , using the procedure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ecr_calculation ] , we find a value for the line rate of the reference architecture for which the measures of the candidate architecture are statistically non - inferior to those of the reference architecture .",
    "the null and the alternative hypotheses of the non - inferiority testing for measure @xmath15 ( e.g. , web page delay ) are given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote population means of @xmath15 for the candidate and the reference architectures , respectively , and @xmath19 represents the tolerance for the measure @xmath15 . the null hypothesis ( @xmath20 )",
    "is rejected if the limit of one - sided confidence interval for the difference ( i.e. , @xmath21 ) is less than the tolerance @xcite .",
    "this means that the candidate architecture is `` at least as good as '' the reference architecture for the given measure @xmath15 .",
    "note that for each measure @xmath15 , we need to determine an appropriate tolerance value ( @xmath19 ) and , if needed , change the hypotheses accordingly . for example , we need to change the hypotheses for the dfr of streaming video ( i.e. , the higher , the better ) as follows : @xmath22",
    "to support the new comparative analysis framework described in section [ sec : comparison_framework ] , we need a flexible , yet computationally powerful experimental platform ; to carry out the statistical hypothesis testing in the proposed ecr calculation procedure , we need a sample of performance measures big enough to compute a reliable test statistic . in case of simulation experiments , this means that we have to repeat a simulation many times with a different random number seed per run , which is quite challenging for large - scale simulations .",
    "the experimental platform also should be able to capture the interaction of many traffic flows through a complete protocol stack , which are generated either by actual users or , as a practical alternative , based on user behavior models .",
    "a real , physical test bed in this regard is hardly a viable option , considering a long cycle of design and performance evaluation of new architectures and protocols , at least at the stage of the clean - slate design .    in this regard",
    ", we decided to implement a virtual test bed composed of detailed simulation models based on omnet++ @xcite and inet framework @xcite which provide models for end - user applications as well as a complete tcp / ip protocol stack .",
    "note that simulation studies in optical networking area usually focus on the issues at the physical and/or the data link layer only but neglect the issues at higher layers due to the limit in computing power .",
    "the recent introduction of high - performance computing ( hpc ) clusters and the cloud computing @xcite , however , brings enormous computing power at a much lower cost and , in case of the cloud computing , on - demand basis ; this enables researchers to carry out a series of large - scale network simulations in a realistic environment , which was neither practical nor economically feasible in the past .",
    "specifically , we are using amazon elastic compute cloud ( amazon ec2 ) as a running platform for the virtual test bed , while we are developing programs at a local hpc cluster for ease of testing and debugging processes .",
    "[ fig : virtual_testbed_overview ] shows the overview of the virtual test bed where major building blocks are identified in addition to the system under test between the service node interface ( sni ) and the uni . for the reference architecture model , the olt and the onu",
    "are implemented using a general ip router and an ethernet switch . for the candidate architectures ,",
    "the hybrid tdm / wdm - pon under the success - hpon architecture @xcite has been already implemented , and the implementation of 10g - epon is currently underway .",
    "[ fig : multi - level_traffic_modelling ] shows our multi - level approach to traffic modelling and generation in the virtual test bed ; as indicated by the dotted line in the figure , a user - level behavioural model governing underlying applications / services is still missing in the current implementation , while session - level and packet - level models have already been implemented for http , ftp , and udp steaming video @xcite .",
    "we adapt the model proposed in @xcite for http traffic generation at the client side above tcp layer and without caching and pipelining in a browser , while we use the ftp model from @xcite without any modification . for both the traffic types ,",
    "the virtual test bed provides a capability of measuring session - level delay , throughput , and transfer rate as indirect measure of user - perceived performances .",
    "in addition to http and ftp traffic , we also implemented a high - rate , hd - tv - quality streaming video traffic for the virtual test bed , which is considered one of killer applications for the ngoa .",
    "the implemented traffic module can generate frames based on trace files from the asu video trace library @xcite . as a measure of user - perceived quality of video stream",
    ", we adopt the dfr which is defined as the ratio of successfully decoded frames at a receiver to the total number of frames sent by a video source @xcite : the larger the value of dfr , the better the video quality perceived by the end - user . for details of the implemented traffic models , readers are referred to @xcite .",
    "[ fig : user_node_model ] shows a model for an end - user node which is connected to the onu through uni .",
    "currently , the number of traffic sessions ( i.e. , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ) is static and configured at the beginning of a simulation through an input file . once we implement a user - level behavior model , however , the number of traffic sessions will be dynamically controlled by it during the simulation .",
    "here are the lessons from our initial work reported in @xcite : because we need to run multiple simulations for given parameters in order to compute a test statistic for the ecr calculation , we repeated each simulation five times with different random number seeds .",
    "each simulation ran for 3 hours in simulation time ( much longer in real time ) , and the data were gathered after a warmup period of 20 minutes ; the warmup period should be long enough to reduce the transient effects from the pon ranging procedure and start - up delays introduced by streaming video encoding / decoding processes as well as networking protocols like tcp .",
    "the total number of simulation runs for the initial work is more than 1000 ( i.e. , 780 and 250 for the reference and the shared architectures , respectively ) , and it took several months to finish the whole simulations with a linux hpc cluster with 22 computing nodes , each with 8-gb memory and an 8-core intel xeon cpu running at 2 ghz .    as we discussed before , the cloud computing could be a solution in this regard ; we can run 1000 + simulations simultaneously with the equal number of virtual computers ( or cores ) in principle . to reduce the run time of each individual simulation , however , we need another approach on top of cloud computing : parallelization .",
    "fortunately , the omnet++ supports parallel simulation through message passing interface ( mpi ) @xcite library , and we are currently extending the implemented models for parallel simulation . once the virtual test bed is ready for parallel simulation , we can increase the number of virtual computers ( e.g. , 2000 for 1000 simulations ) to speed up run times .    as for the user - level behavioral model currently missing , we will build a demographic and behavioural user profile by focusing on groups for initial exploration and surveying large - scale data collection .",
    "note that , because there is no ngoa network deployed now , the use of demographic and behavioural profile obtained from the survey for the architectural study is the only practical option .",
    "then we will build the user - level behavioural model governing underlying application - level traffic models based on the developed profile , which can capture the difference between business and residential users and temporal aspects of end - user behaviours @xcite .",
    "in this section , as a demonstration of the capability of the proposed research framework , we present preliminary results of an ongoing study of the elasticity of ngoa architectures . as of this writing , we have carried out a simulation study of hybrid tdm / wdm - pon under success - hpon architecture with sequential scheduling with schedule - time framing ( @xmath26 ) @xcite , whose block diagram is shown in fig .

    "[ fig : user_node_model ] ) .",
    "the same is the case for a streaming video ( i.e , @xmath30 ) . on the other hand , a user can run multiple ftp sessions in the background",

    ", it is remarkable that the hybrid tdm / wdm - pon with just one transceiver can achieve ecr of 10 gb / s until @xmath40 reaches 6 ; when @xmath43 , streaming video traffic alone pushes about 180-mb / s stream into onu and 2.88-gb / s multiplexed stream into olt ( out of 16 onus ) . by the way",
    ", we found that the ecr based on web page delay with @xmath44 in fig .",

    "longer simulation run and a bigger sample size could eliminate this anomaly .",

    "we have reported the current status of our work on a new research framework for the clean - slate design of ngoa architectures and protocols , which is composed of the comparative analysis framework and the virtual test bed for experiments .",

    "note that there is a major implication of the proposed research framework : the way of comparing network architectures and protocols and presenting their performances would be dramatically changed .",
    "for instance , using the ecr as a reference ( i.e. , under the same ecr by adjusting network configurations like the number of users ) , we can objectively compare the issues of cost and energy efficiency of candidate architectures , which is critical for the clean - slate design of ngoa .",
    "in addition , the proposed research framework could greatly help network service providers do proper dimensioning of their ngoa before the actual deployment in the field , especially because the notion of ecr is based on user - perceived performances .",

    "<S> a comprehensive research framework for a comparative analysis of candidate network architectures and protocols in the clean - slate design of next - generation optical access is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed research framework consists of a comparative analysis framework based on multivariate non - inferiority testing and a notion of equivalent circuit rate taking into account user - perceived performances , and a virtual test bed providing a complete experimental platform for the comparative analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the capability of the research framework is demonstrated through numerical results from the study of the elasticity of hybrid tdm / wdm - pon based on tunable transceivers .    </S>",
