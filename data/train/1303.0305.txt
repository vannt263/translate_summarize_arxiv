    "renormalization methods are powerful tools for studying the long - wavelength properties of physical systems by a systematic elimination of high - energy degrees of freedom .",
    "the first numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method was developed by wilson @xcite to solve the kondo problem , an important problem in physics that involves the interaction of a magnetic impurity with a conduction band @xcite .",
    "the more recent density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method was successfully applied to a large class of one - dimensional ( @xmath0 ) quantum systems @xcite and a few @xmath1 systems @xcite .",
    "recent advances in quantum information theory also led to renormalization and variational methods , including peps  @xcite , mera @xcite , and tensor renormalization @xcite .",
    "the problem with known renormalization methods is that they suffer from important limitations when studying systems in space dimension @xmath2 or with a large number of ground states .",
    "our goal is to construct a renormalization method that can be applied to such systems when the hamiltonians under consideration satisfy a  frustration - free \" ( ff ) property .    the term `` frustration free '' was first coined by the quantum - information community  @xcite to denote a class of hamiltonians @xmath3 whose ground states are also ground states of each local term @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 refers to a finite set of degrees of freedom , e.g. , a unit or a finite subsystem .",
    "while describing such hamiltonians as ff is adequate from a viewpoint that we discuss below , the term ff can be confusing if we adopt a more traditional convention of identifying frustration with competing interactions .",
    "for example , the triangular lattice ising model with antiferromagnetic ( afm ) exchange ( @xmath6 ) is the paradigmatic example of a frustrated hamiltonian .",
    "however , this model is ff according to the previous definition .",
    "we let @xmath5 be the three spins @xmath7 in the @xmath8th triangle , @xmath9 , and define @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "the hamiltonian is ff because any ground state @xmath11 of @xmath12 satisfies @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath11 is also a ground state of each @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath11 does not _ minimize _ each of the bond hamiltonians @xmath14 , reason why the model is considered to be frustrated according to the traditional convention .",
    "the previous discussion implies that the concept of frustration is relative to a particular decomposition of @xmath12 .",
    "the traditional interpretation of frustration assumes a decomposition of @xmath12 dictated by the physical nature of the interactions . however , while @xmath12 may be frustrated with respect to one decomposition , it may still be ff because the competition between interactions on different units disappears when we consider a different decomposition ( e.g. , triangles instead of bonds in the ising example ) .",
    "remarkably , ff hamiltonians are ubiquitous in condensed matter and quantum information theory .",
    "they include ising models , the aklt model  @xcite , parent hamiltonians of peps  @xcite , and hamiltonians that can simulate quantum circuits  @xcite .",
    "several other frustrated magnets also correspond to ff hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "ground states of ff hamiltonians contain all the characteristics of highly frustrated physical systems : large ground state degeneracy  @xcite , coexistence of different phases , and exotic orderings .    in this manuscript",
    ", we introduce an exact real - space renormalization method ( erm ) that obtains the full ground - space of ff hamiltonians .",
    "the output of the erm is a sequence of tensors whose contraction allows us to compute expectation values of observables and amplitudes of the ground states ( sec .",
    "[ sec : rm ] ) .",
    "the computational cost of our method ( i.e. , the cost of the tensor contraction ) is polynomial in the ground - space degeneracy of the ff hamiltonians involved in the renormalization steps .",
    "if such a degeneracy increases polynomially with the system size , the erm is efficient .",
    "otherwise , for exponentially large degeneracies , the erm is inefficient but can substantially outperform other numerical techniques for this problem .    to illustrate the potential of our method",
    ", we apply it to two ff spin systems that have largely degenerate ground states .",
    "the first system is a spin-1/2 heisenberg model with four - spin cyclic - exchange interactions that is defined on a square lattice ( sec .",
    "[ sec:2dmagnet ] ) .",
    "the ground state degeneracy is exponential in the linear size , @xmath15 , of the lattice .",
    "such a degeneracy is much smaller than the hilbert space dimension @xmath16 , so the erm outperforms exact diagonalization in this case . besides the singlet ground states that were in identified in ref .",
    "@xcite , we find a triplet ground state that consists of a triplon that propagates in a background of fluctuating singlet dimers .",
    "the propagation of this triplon leads to an incipient long range afm ordering , which indicates that the triplet ground state describes an afm quantum critical point .",
    "such a triplet ground state also exists in rectangular spin lattices of size @xmath17 , @xmath18 , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "in particular , lajk , sindzingre , and penc , gave an analytical expression of this state for the case of three - leg tubes ( @xmath19 ) @xcite .",
    "the second of system consists of the family of spin-1/2 heisenberg chains with uniaxial exchange anisotropy and nearest and next - nearest - neighbor exchange interactions ( sec .",
    "[ sec:1dheisenberg ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonians in this family are also ff .",
    "an analytical and closed form representation for the ground states of this family , in terms of anyonic operators , was given in ref .",
    "however , such a representation may not be useful for computing some expectation values of spin - spin correlations efficiently .",
    "those expectation values can be efficiently computed with the erm .",
    "we note that quantum monte carlo methods , that are not based on renormalization , can not be applied to most ff hamiltonians because of the infamous sign problem .",
    "we start by providing a brief description of the erm ( technical details are provided in appendix  [ app : rm ] ) . for simplicity",

    ", the erm _ grows _ the system by adding one plaquette .",

    "the number of spins increases by one or by two at each step [ see for instance steps 5 and 6 in fig . [ fig : lattice](b ) ] .",
    "it is important to introduce hamiltonian terms corresponding to a plaquette at a time ( the projectors @xmath116 ) and to avoid including terms belonging to neighboring plaquettes .",
    "for instance , a nearest neighbor exchange term in eq .   is shared by two neighboring plaquettes .",
    "such a term should be split accordingly to assure that only one projector is added per step .",
    "we applied the erm to rectangular lattices of sizes @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and periodic boundary conditions .",

    "[ fig : lattice](b ) , @xmath88 increases as we increase @xmath120 but it does not change substantially when we increase @xmath121 .",
    "this property allows us to study remarkably large system sizes by keeping @xmath120 constant and by increasing the number of plaquettes in the @xmath122 direction to relatively large values of @xmath121 .",

    "this implies diagonalizing a @xmath81 matrix in the @xmath78th step , with @xmath123 or @xmath124 , depending on the number of spins added at that step ( one or two , respectively ) .",

    "it can either select one particular valence bond ordering via an order by disorder mechanism , or simply destroy any long range bond ordering . in the former scenario , the application of a small magnetic field , @xmath33 , that couples to the spins via the zeeman term @xmath162 , should stabilize a particular bond ordering out of the exponentially large number of degenerate bond ordered ground states that exist at @xmath163 .",
    "the selection mechanism would be provided by the kinetic energy of the field induced triplons , which should be minimized for a particular bond ordered background . in this scenario ,",

    "the bond fluctuations induced by the triplon propagation are strong enough to produce a valence bond liquid with short - range bond - bond correlations .",
