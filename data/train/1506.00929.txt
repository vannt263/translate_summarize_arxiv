    "a potential source of dominant backgrounds for many rare - event searches or screening detectors is from radon daughter plate - out  @xcite .",
    "backgrounds from @xmath6pb and the recoiling @xmath7pb nucleus from the @xmath8 decay of @xmath6po are the dominant low - energy backgrounds for xmass  @xcite , supercdms soudan  @xcite and edelweiss  @xcite , and are expected to be dominant for supercdms snolab and the betacage screener  @xcite without improvements .",
    "radon daughters on surfaces may dominate for supernemo  @xcite and cuore  @xcite .",
    "both neutrons from ( @xmath9 ) reactions and @xmath7pb recoils are important for lz  @xcite , xenon1 t , and darkside .",
    "storing and assembling detector components may be possible using vacuum glove boxes or by cleaning components upon commissioning (  @xcite ) .",
    "however , when the components are large or require delicate assembly , a vacuum glove box can be impractical .",
    "cleaning can also be impractical when the components are delicate or have complex geometries .    to create a radon - mitigated , breathable - air environment",
    "one may consider two system classes : continuous flow through a filtration column and swing flow through two or more filtration columns .",
    "the filtration columns are usually filled with activated carbon .",
    "the continuous flow system (  @xcite ) operates on the basis that some considerable fraction of radon decays before exiting the column . for an ideal column ,",
    "the final radon concentration @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the radon concentration of the input air , @xmath12 is the characteristic break - through time of the filter , and @xmath13days is the mean lifetime of radon . to increase the break - through time , and therefore make a continuous flow system practical , one must cool the carbon to reduce desorption of radon .",
    "continuous flow systems are relatively simple and robust , are commercially available , and typically achieve reduction factors of @xmath01000@xmath3 , to @xmath01030mbqm@xmath1 .    in a swing flow system ,",
    "two or more filtration columns are used .",
    "while filtering through one column the other is regenerated using either low pressure or high temperatures to allow radon to desorb efficiently and be exhausted . for a vacuum - swing - adsorption ( vsa ) system (  @xcite ) , high - radon input air is filtered through the first column while the second column is pumped down to @xmath01torr .",
    "well before the break - through time , the path of the high - radon input air is switched so that it flows through the second column instead , allowing the first to regenerate .",
    "for an ideal column , no radon reaches the output .",
    "swing flow systems are more complicated both in operation and analysis . a vsa system ( @xmath14 fig .  [ vsadiagram ] )",
    "can potentially outperform a continuous flow system at a lower cost .",
    "temperature - swing systems (  @xcite ) should provide best performance but at the highest cost and complexity .",
    "we use the vsa technique because of its lower cost and potential for excellent radon reduction .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the vsa radon mitigation system tends to reduce relative humidity of the cleanroom air to @xmath05% .",
    "using water for humidification without reducing its activity would introduce radon into the cleanroom . to reduce water activity , we will age the water until a sufficient fraction of radon has decayed away .",
    "the water to be used is expected to have an activity of @xmath01000bqm@xmath1 .",
    "if no aging is done and the water is used for increasing the relative humidity in the cleanroom , the activity contribution to the cleanroom would be @xmath06mbqm@xmath1 because the vapor density of water at 35% relative humidity is @xmath0@xmath15gcm@xmath1 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ vsaresults]b , after aging , the activity will be reduced by 100@xmath3 and will contribute only 100 s of @xmath17bqm@xmath1 .",
    "the low - radon humidification system consists of two large ( 110gal ) tanks made of low - density polyethylene ( ldpe ) .",
    "water from a local reverse osmosis system fills the first tank .",
    "the water is aged until its activity is sufficiently low ( about 10bqm@xmath1 ) and then transferred to the second tank . upon transferring ,",
    "the first tank is again filled and the aging process repeats .",
    "the second tank supplies low - radon water to the cleanroom humidification system at a rate of about 3galday@xmath18 .",
    "the system is designed such that the aged water in the second tank lasts longer than the aging time .",
    "in addition , an in - line filter will prevent any particulates from entering the cleanroom .",
    "sufficient aging time is determined by the intrinsic activity of the water , with consideration of radon emanation from the ldpe tank , and radon diffusion through the tank walls , as shown in fig .",
    "[ vsaresults]b .",
    "aging for 35days is sufficient to contribute only 100 s of @xmath17bqm@xmath1 to the cleanroom .",
    "further aging makes little difference as the total activity asymptotically approaches the contribution from diffusion , which limits this system .",
    "if a lower activity is needed in the future , switching to metal tanks would reduce the contribution from humidification to the order of 10nbqm@xmath1 , because ldpe has a diffusion coefficient on order of 10@xmath19m@xmath20s@xmath18 while metal is @xmath010@xmath21m@xmath20s@xmath18  @xcite .",
    "other radon - mitigation upgrades that have yet to be installed are taller carbon columns ( providing an additional 175 kg activated carbon each ) and a more powerful roughing pump , which should allow easier maintenance as well as providing a small improvement in performance . in principle , the increased height of the carbon columns should provide additional reduction in radon concentration of another factor @xmath01001000@xmath3 , potentially providing world - leading radon reduction at a modest cost .",
