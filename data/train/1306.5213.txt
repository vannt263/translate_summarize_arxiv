    "the condition is known as the _ signorini boundary condition _ and the problem  as the _ ( parabolic ) signorini problem _ for the heat equation .",
    "the function @xmath18 is called the _ thin obstacle _ , since @xmath19 is restricted to stay above @xmath18 on @xmath20 .",
    "classical examples where signorini - type boundary conditions appear are the problems with unilateral constraints in elastostatics ( including the original signorini problem @xcite ) , problems with semipermeable membranes in fluid mechanics ( including the phenomenon of osmosis and osmotic pressure in biochemistry ) , and the problems on the temperature control on the boundary in thermics .",
    "we refer to the book of duvaut and lions @xcite , where many such applications are discussed and the mathematical models are derived .",
    "another historical importance of the parabolic signorini problem is that it serves as one of the prototypical examples of evolutionary _ variational inequalities _ , going back to the foundational paper by lions and stampacchia @xcite , where the existence and uniqueness of certain weak solutions were established . in this paper",
    ", we work with a stronger notion of solution .",
    "thus , we say that a function @xmath21 solves  if @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "the reader should see section  [ sec : parab - funct - class ] for the definitions of the relevant parabolic functional classes .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of such @xmath19 , under some natural assumptions on @xmath18 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 can be found in @xcite .",
    "see also section  [ sec : existence - regularity ] for more details .",
    "two major questions arise in the study of the problem  :    * the regularity properties of @xmath19 ; * the structure and regularity of the _ free boundary _",

    "such regularity was first proved by richardson  @xcite in dimension @xmath38 , and by caffarelli @xcite for @xmath39 . in the parabolic case ,",
    "this was first proved by athanasopoulos  @xcite , and subsequently by uraltseva  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , under certain regularity assumptions on the boundary data , which were further relaxed by arkhipova and uraltseva @xcite .",
    "we note that the hlder continuity of @xmath33 is the best regularity one should expect for the solution of . this can be seen from the example @xmath40 which is a harmonic function in @xmath41 , and satisfies the signorini boundary conditions on @xmath42 , with thin obstacle @xmath43 .",
    "this example also suggests that the optimal hlder exponent for @xmath33 should be @xmath44 , at least when @xmath4 is flat ( contained in a hyperplane ) .",
    "indeed , in the time - independent case , such optimal @xmath45 regularity was proved in dimension @xmath38 in the cited paper by richardson  @xcite .",
    "the case of arbitrary space dimension ( still time - independent ) , however , had to wait for the breakthrough work of athanasopoulos and caffarelli  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the proof of the optimal regularity for the original signorini problem in elastostatics was announced by andersson @xcite .",
    "one of the main objectives of this paper is to establish , in the parabolic signorini problem , and for a flat thin manifold @xmath4 , that @xmath46 , or more precisely that @xmath47 , see theorem  [ thm : opt - reg ] below .",
    "our approach is inspired by the works of athanasopoulos , caffarelli , and salsa @xcite and caffarelli , salsa , and silvestre @xcite on the time - independent problem .",
    "in such papers a generalization of the celebrated almgren s frequency formula established in @xcite was used , not only to give an alternative proof of the optimal @xmath45 regularity of solutions , but also to study the so - called _ regular set _ @xmath48 of the free boundary @xmath32 .",
    "this approach was subsequently refined in @xcite by the second and third named authors with the objective of classifying the free boundary points according to their separation rate from the thin obstacle @xmath18 .",
    "in @xcite the authors also introduced generalizations of weiss s and monneau s monotonicity formulas , originally developed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , for the classical obstacle problem .",
    "such generalized weiss s and monneau s monotonicity formulas allowed to prove a structural theorem on the so - called _ singular set _ @xmath49 of the free boundary , see @xcite . for an exposition of these results in the case",
    "when the thin obstacle @xmath43 we also refer to the book by the third named author , shahgholian , and uraltseva @xcite*chapter 9 .",
    "in closing we mention that , as far as we are aware of , the only result presently available concerning the free boundary in the parabolic setting is that of athanasopoulos @xcite , under assumptions on the boundary data that guarantee boundedness and nonnegativity of @xmath50 . in that paper",
    "it is shown that the free boundary is locally given as a graph @xmath51 for a lipschitz continuous function @xmath52 .      in this paper",
    "we extend all the above mentioned results from the elliptic to the parabolic case .",
    "we focus on the situation when the principal part of the diffusion operator is the laplacian and that the thin manifold @xmath4 is flat and contained in @xmath53 .",
    "one of our central results is a generalization of almgren s frequency formula @xcite , see theorem  [ thm : thin - monotonicity ] below .",
    "as it is well known , the parabolic counterpart of almgren s formula was established by poon @xcite , for functions which are caloric in an infinite strip @xmath54 $ ] . in section  [ sec : gener - freq - funct ] , we establish a truncated version of that formula for the solutions of the parabolic signorini problem , similar to the ones in @xcite and @xcite . the time dependent case presents , however , substantial novel challenges with respect to the elliptic setting .",
    "these are mainly due to the lack of regularity of the solution in the @xmath55-variable , a fact which makes the justification of differentiation formulas and the control of error terms quite difficult .",
    "to overcome these obstructions , we have introduced ( steklov - type ) averaged versions of the quantities involved in our main monotonicity formulas .",
    "this basic idea has enabled us to successfully control the error terms .",
    "similarly to what was done in @xcite , we then undertake a systematic classification of the free boundary points based on the limit at the point in question of the generalized frequency function .",
    "when the thin obstacle @xmath18 is in the class @xmath56 , @xmath57 , this classification translates into assigning to each free boundary point in @xmath32 ( or more generally to every point on the _ extended free boundary _",
    "@xmath58 , see section  [ sec : classes - solutions ] ) a certain _ frequency _",
    "@xmath59 , see sections  [ sec : exist - homog - blow ] and [ sec : class - free - bound ] . at the points for which @xmath60 , the separation rate of the solution @xmath19 from the thin obstacle can be `` detected '' , in a sense that it will exceed the truncation term in the generalized frequency formula . at those points",
    "we are then able to consider the so - called blowups , which will be parabolically @xmath61-homogeneous solutions of the signorini problem , see section  [ sec : exist - homog - blow ] .",
    "next , we show that , similarly to what happens in the elliptic case , the smallest possible value of the frequency at a free boundary point is @xmath62 , see section  [ sec : homog - glob - solut ] .",
    "we emphasize that our proof of this fact does not rely on the semiconvexity estimates , as in the elliptic case ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "rather , we use the monotonicity formula of caffarelli  @xcite to reduce the problem to the spatial dimension @xmath38 , and then study the eigenvalues of the ornstein - uhlenbeck operator in domains with slits ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : slit - dom ] in section  [ sec : homog - glob - solut ] ) .",
    "the elliptic version of this argument has appeared earlier in the book @xcite*chapter  9 .",
    "the bound @xmath63 ultimately implies the optimal @xmath64 regularity of solutions , see section  [ sec : optim - regul - solut ] .",
    "we next turn to studying the regularity properties of the free boundary .",
    "we start with the so - called _ regular set _",
    "@xmath48 , which corresponds to free boundary points of minimal frequency @xmath65 .",
    "similarly to the elliptic case , studied in @xcite , the lipschitz regularity of @xmath48 with respect to the space variables follows by showing that there is a cone of spatial directions in which @xmath66 is monotone .",
    "the @xmath44-hlder regularity in @xmath55 is then a consequence of the fact that the blowups at regular points are @xmath55-independent , see theorem  [ thm : lip - reg - reg - set ] .",
    "thus , after possibly rotating the coordinate axes in @xmath67 , we obtain that @xmath48 is given locally as a graph @xmath68 where @xmath25 is parabolically lipschitz ( or @xmath69 in alternative terminology ) . to prove the hlder @xmath70 regularity of @xmath71 , @xmath72",
    ", we then use an idea that goes back to the paper of athanasopoulos and caffarelli @xcite based on an application of the boundary harnack principle ( forward and backward ) for so - called domains with thin lipschitz complement , i.e , domains of the type @xmath73 see lemma  [ lem : bhp ] . this result",
    "was recently established in the work of the third named author and shi @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that , unlike the elliptic case , the boundary harnack principle for such domains can not be reduced to the other known results in the parabolic setting ( see e.g.  @xcite for parabolically lipschitz domains , or @xcite for parabolically nta domains with reifenberg flat boundary ) .",
    "another type of free boundary points that we study are the so - called _ singular points _",
    ", where the coincidence set @xmath74 has zero @xmath75-density in the thin manifold with respect to the thin parabolic cylinders .",
    "this corresponds to free boundary points with frequency @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "the blowups at those points are parabolically @xmath61-homogeneous polynomials , see section  [ sec : free - bound - sing ] .    following the approach in @xcite , in section  [ sec : weiss - monneau - type ]",
    "we establish appropriate parabolic versions of monotonicity formulas of weiss and monneau type . using such formulas we are able to prove the uniqueness of the blowups at singular free boundary points @xmath78 , and consequently obtain a taylor expansion of the type @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a polynomial of parabolic degree @xmath61 that depends continuously on the singular point @xmath78 with frequency @xmath61 .",
    "we note that such expansion holds only for @xmath81 and may fail for @xmath82 ( see remark  [ rem : taylor - cntrex ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we show that this expansion essentially holds when restricted to singular points @xmath83 , even for @xmath84 .",
    "this is necessary in order to verify the compatibility condition in a parabolic version of the whitney s extension theorem ( given in appendix  [ sec : parab - whitn - extens ] ) . using the latter we are then able to prove a structural theorem for the singular set . for the elliptic counterpart of this result see @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned at this moment that one difference between the parabolic case treated in the present paper and its elliptic counterpart is the presence of new types of singular points , which we call _ time - like_. at such points the blowup may become independent of the space variables @xmath85 . we show that such singular points are contained in a countable union of graphs of the type @xmath86 where @xmath25 is a @xmath87 function .",
    "the other singular points , which we call _ space - like _ , are contained in countable union of @xmath88-dimensional @xmath89 manifolds ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "after a possible rotation of coordinates in @xmath67 , such manifolds are locally representable as graphs of the type @xmath91 with @xmath25 and @xmath71 , @xmath92 , continuous .      the time - independent version of the signorini problem is closely related to the obstacle problem for the half - laplacian in @xmath67 @xmath93 more precisely , if we consider a harmonic extension of @xmath94 from @xmath95 to @xmath41 ( by means of a convolution with the poisson kernel )",
    ", we will have that @xmath96 thus , the extension @xmath94 will solve the signorini problem in @xmath41 . more generally , in the above problem instead of the half - laplacian one can consider an arbitrary fractional power of the laplacian @xmath97 , @xmath98 , see e.g. the thesis of silvestre @xcite .",
    "problems of this kind appear for instance in mathematical finance , in the valuation of american options , when the asset prices are modelled by jump processes .",
    "the time - independent problem corresponds to the so - called perpetual options , with infinite maturity time . in such framework , with the aid of an extension theorem of caffarelli and silvestre @xcite , many of the results known for @xmath99 can be proved also for all powers @xmath98 , see @xcite .",
    "the evolution version of the problem above is driven by the fractional diffusion and can be written as @xmath100 in @xmath101 with the initial condition @xmath102 this problem has been recently studied by caffarelli and figalli @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that , although their time - independent versions are locally equivalent , the problem studied in @xcite is very different from the one considered in the present paper .    in relation to temperature control problems on the boundary , described in @xcite , we would like to mention the two recent papers by athanasopoulos and caffarelli @xcite , and by allen and shi @xcite .",
    "both papers deal with two - phase problems that can be viewed as generalizations of the one - phase problem ( with @xmath103 ) considered in this paper .",
    "the paper @xcite establishes the phenomenon of separation of phases , thereby locally reducing the study of the two - phase problem to that of one - phase .",
    "a similar phenomenon was shown earlier in the elliptic case by allen , lindgren , and the third named author @xcite .      in what follows",
    "we provide a brief description of the structure of the paper .    * in section  [ sec : notat - prel ] we introduce the notations used throughout the paper , and describe the relevant parabolic functional classes . * in section  [ sec : existence - regularity ] we overview some of the known basic regularity properties of the solution @xmath19 of the parabolic signorini problem .",
    "the main ones are : @xmath104 ; and , @xmath105 for some @xmath106 .",
    "such results will be extensively used in our paper . * in section  [ sec : classes - solutions ] we introduce the classes of solutions @xmath107 of the parabolic signorini problem with a thin obstacle @xmath18 , and show how to effectively `` subtract '' the obstacle by maximally using its regularity . in this process",
    "we convert the problem to one with zero thin obstacle , but with a non - homogeneous right hand side @xmath108 in the equation . in order",
    "to apply our main monotonicity formulas we also need to to extend the resulting functions from @xmath109 to the entire strip @xmath110 .",
    "we achieve this by multiplication by a a cutoff function , and denote the resulting class of functions by @xmath111 .",
    "* section  [ sec : estimates - w2 - 1_2s_1 + ] contains generalizations of @xmath112 estimates to the weighted spaced with gaussian measure .",
    "these estimates will be instrumental in the proof of the generalized frequency formula in section  [ sec : gener - freq - funct ] and in the study of the blowups in section  [ sec : exist - homog - blow ] . in order not to distract the reader from the main content ,",
    "we have deferred the proof of these estimates to the appendix  [ sec : est - gauss - proofs ] .",
    "* section  [ sec : gener - freq - funct ] is the most technical part of the paper .",
    "there , we generalize almgren s ( poon s ) frequency formula to solutions of the parabolic signorini problem . * in section  [ sec : exist - homog - blow ] we prove the existence and homogeneity of the blowups at free boundary points where the separation rate of the solution from the thin obstacle dominates the error ( truncation ) terms in the generalized frequency formula . * in section  [ sec : homog - glob - solut ] we prove that the minimal homogeneity of homogeneous solution of the parabolic signorini problem is @xmath113 . * section  [ sec : optim - regul - solut ] contains the proof of the optimal @xmath64 regularity of the solutions of the parabolic signorini problem . * in the remaining part of the paper we study the free boundary .",
    "we start in section  [ sec : class - free - bound ] by classifying the free boundary points according to the homogeneity of the blowups at the point in question .",
    "we also use the assumed regularity of the thin obstacle in the most optimal way . * in section  [ sec : free - bound - regul ] , we study the so - called regular set @xmath48 and show that it can be locally represented as a graph with @xmath70 regular gradient . * in section",
    "[ sec : free - bound - sing ] we give a characterization of the so - called singular points .",

    "[ sec : struct - sing - set ] we prove the uniqueness of blowups at singular points and the continuous dependence of blowups on compact subsets of the singular set .",
