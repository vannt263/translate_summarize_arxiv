    "radio - quiet quasars are strongly accreting yet lack the extensive 100-kpc scale jets that steadily transport away energy and angular momentum from the nuclei of radio - loud quasars and radio galaxies .",
    "the weak radio core emission associated with radio - quiet quasars has been revealed by a succession of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations usually to be compact on milliarcsecond ( @xmath0parsec ) size scales @xcite .",
    "the luminosities of the cores in such objects can be as high as vlbi measurements of cores in many radio - loud quasars ( @xmath1  @xmath2 ) when imaged with resolution of a few milli - arcsec ; comparable brightness temperatures ( @xmath3  @xmath4k ) are revealed by these observations as well .",
    "the physical size - scales of the observed cores reported in these papers for radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars have a robust upper limit of a few cubic parsec even at redshift @xmath5 .",
    "observations of some nearby seyfert nuclei reveal a flat - spectrum component on milli - arcsecond scales with a misalignment of up to @xmath6 from the linear radio structure on arcsecond scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in some cases , a non - thermal origin for radio cores",
    "is directly ruled out by observations : vlbi observations of the nucleus in ngc1068 in particular reveal linear parsec - scale radio structure perpendicular to the radio jet axis @xcite , with a brightness temperature , @xmath7k , too low to be consistent with synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) @xcite .",
    "its radio spectrum measured between @xmath8ghz and @xmath9ghz is @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite suggest that the observed radio properties of the ngc1068 nucleus are best explained in terms of free - free emission from a disk wind .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to construct a model for agn cores based on this and on observations of the resolved disk - wind outflow from the nuclear regions of the galactic microquasar ss433 , which arises from optically - thin bremsstrahlung @xcite , as an alternative to the long - standing model of a sequence of synchrotron self - absorbed components which conspire to give a smooth flat spectrum @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the `` cosmic conspiracy '' core model  that is , a sequence of distinct homogeneous components each having a peaked spectrum which together give rise to the integrated smooth flat spectrum core as in the case of the bl lacertae object 0735 + 178 @xcite  has been applied to many observations of cores in the last three decades . in many subsequent observations of many different objects",
    "there has been no direct observational evidence supporting this paradigm and indirect evidence against it , even under the scrutiny of sub - milliarcsec , multi - epoch observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is simply no evidence in support of multiple self - absorbed components which conveniently have successively higher turn - over frequencies to explain the overall integrated spectral properties of stationary cores .",
    "we are compelled , therefore , to explore the validity of an alternative model in which the mechanism responsible for the radio emission is optically - thin bremsstrahlung arising from a disk wind , rather than embryonic , and moving , jet knots .",
    "a common misconception is that high observed brightness temperatures necessarily imply a non - thermal source . whilst it is true that a high brightness temperature @xmath11 rules out optically - thick thermal emission ( because @xmath11 can not exceed the gas temperature , @xmath12 , which is low in the case of an optically thick source because a blackbody is an efficient radiator ) ,",
    "optically-_thin _ thermal emission can not be ruled out as readily .",
    "the brightness temperature of an optically - thin thermal source of size @xmath13 is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the volume emissivity at frequency @xmath16 . at temperatures above @xmath17",
    ", gas is completely ionized and if the plasma is sufficiently dense and remains subrelativistic , then two - body ( i.e.  free - free ) processes dominate compton processes .",
    "the brightness temperature can then be expressed as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the free - free optical depth .",
    "thus , a high brightness temperature can arise from a thermal plasma provided it is hot and marginally optically thin .",
    "moreover , because the spectral index of bremsstrahlung emission is @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the flux density at frequency @xmath16 ) , a flat spectrum is naturally produced at radio frequencies ( @xmath23 ) .    in the following ,",
    "we consider a thermal accretion disk wind that is present at radii @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the disk radius at which the wind is launched ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . within this radius ,",
    "outflows are likely to become poynting - flux - dominated and form a magnetized corona and/or jet .",
    "self - absorbed synchrotron radiation from the jet can of course contribute to the unresolved core radio emission .",
    "we consider the possibility that the thermal disk wind also contributes to flat - spectrum core radio emission through optically - thin free - free radiation . at the base of the wind",
    ", the electron number density , @xmath26 , can be related to the mass outflow rate , @xmath27 , via the continuity equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the escape speed at this radius and @xmath30 is the geometrical covering factor of the outflow .",
    "this gives @xmath31 where @xmath32 and where we have used a mean molecular weight @xmath33 for fully ionized hydrogen . at these densities ,",
    "the base of the wind is highly opaque ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we now consider the properties of the wind further out .",
    "optically - thin thermal emission from the disk wind can become important beyond a photospheric radius @xmath34 where the wind becomes transparent .",
    "this is the radius at which the effective optical depth , @xmath35 @xcite , is unity as viewed by a distant observer . here",
    ", @xmath36 is the optical depth due to free - free absorption and @xmath37 is the electron scattering optical depth . to determine @xmath34 from the condition @xmath38 , we first calculate separately the scattering and absorption photospheric radii @xmath39 and @xmath40 and determine the physical conditions under which they are approximately equal . using @xmath41 from mass continuity ( eqn[e : ne1 ] ) , the radius @xmath39 at which @xmath42 is determined from @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the thomson scattering cross section .",
    "this gives @xmath45 similarly , the radius @xmath40 at which @xmath46 is determined from @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the free - free absorption coefficient and @xmath49 is the velocity - averaged free - free gaunt factor @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "thus , a hot disk wind that is optically - thin to both electron scattering and radio - frequency free - free absorption can exist beyond a photospheric radius @xmath54 .",
    "we now consider the bremsstrahlung radio power emitted by the optically - thin part of the wind .",
    "the specific bremsstrahlung luminosity is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the free - free volume emissivity . for an electrically neutral hydrogen plasma , @xmath57 @xcite",
    "this gives a specific luminosity per solid angle @xmath58      @xcite applied an innovative technique to measure radio core emission from the quasars in the sdss dr3 quasar catalog @xcite . by stacking images from the first survey @xcite",
    ", they found radio core luminosities in the range of @xmath1 ",
    "@xmath59 , consistent with luminosities measured on milli - arcsecond scales @xcite .",
    "of course , one can not be sure that the core luminosities measured by @xcite are not elevated because of contamination by synchrotron emission from moving jet knots .",
    "indeed , @xcite have direct observational evidence for a highly relativistic jet in the bona fide radio - quiet quasar pg1407 + 263 .",
    "a comparison of the radio wind luminosities predicted by eqn([e : lnu ] ) and observed radio core luminosities indicates that disk winds can make a non - negligible contribution to observed radio core luminosities only if there is significant mass loss , with @xmath27 exceeding the eddington limit , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the black hole mass and @xmath62 is the radiative efficiency .",
    "this in turn implies accretion rates @xmath63 .",
    "the main role of the disk wind is then to remove excess angular momentum , thereby reducing the accretion rate at smaller radii .",
    "are super - eddington accretion and outflow rates plausible ?",
    "we remark that the eddington limit is based on simplifying ( and incorrect ) assumptions of spherical symmetry and a fiducial @xmath64% radiative efficiency .",
    "the brightest radio galaxies and quasars have bolometric luminosities @xmath65 , requiring mass accretion rates of @xmath66 .",
    "this is a lower limit because the observed radiative output is almost certainly only a small fraction of the total power extracted from accretion , much of which can be converted into low radiative efficiency phenomena such as magnetized jets and/or a corona ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , mass outflow rates for warm , dense ionized gas inferred from x - ray absorption spectra of quasars and seyferts are typically @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "again , these values imply super - eddington accretion . in the case of ss433 ,",
    "the mass outflow rate inferred for the observed radio wind is @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "if this galactic microquasar is a @xmath69 black hole , then this implies an astonishing mass loss rate of @xmath70 .",
    "if radio core emission arises at least in part from an optically - thin disk wind , then we may expect to observe a correlation between the radio wind emission and the optical / uv blackbody disk emission .",
    "this is expected because the disk wind can modify the local radial structure of the accretion flow , resulting in a disk emission spectrum that is redder and dimmer than that of a disk without outflows @xcite .",
    "such a correlation has indeed been reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .",
    "14 ) , who find that the sdss dr3 quasars with redder colours tend to have higher mean radio flux densities and are radio - louder than quasars with standard colours .",
    "additionally , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .",
    "9 ) find a remarkably tight correlation between the @xmath71 median radio luminosity and the absolute magnitude at @xmath72 restframe wavelength , with the specific radio and optical luminosities related via @xmath73 .",
    "the disk wind model predicts that @xmath74 and that optical bremsstrahlung wind emission should begin to contribute significantly to the observed ( @xmath75-corrected ) mean optical quasar luminosity at @xmath72 ( restframe ) , @xmath76 , when @xmath77 ( see eqn[e : lnu ] ) .",
    "thus , unless the mass loss rate is extraordinarily high ( that is , higher than the rates inferred from other independent observations  c.f .  3 ) , it is likely that the optically - thick disk emission , rather than the optically - thin disk wind emission , is primarily responsible for the observed @xmath72 emission .",
    "remarkably , when @xcite calculate the radio loudness parameter , @xmath78 , adjusted to remove the strong radio / optical correlation , they find @xmath79 ( their fig .",
    "while it is not clear that this result is definitive , because of their assumption that all radio cores at all redshifts have a straight spectral index of @xmath80 ( for which there are many counterexamples , some of them seemingly systematic with redshift ) , we note that our disk wind model provides a natural explanation for @xmath81 ( corrected for blackbody disk emission ) being consistently close to zero .",
    "the parsec - scale cores of radio - quiet quasars are comparable in luminosity , size and brightness temperature to those in radio - loud quasars .",
    "we suggest that the model explored in this paper has applicability to the stationary , unresolved , flat spectrum components revealed with milli - arcsecond vlbi observations , now an established technique for revealing moving and evolving synchrotron - emitting jet knots ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and even revealed with global vlbi techniques with 10s of micro - arcsecond resolution @xcite .",
    "@xcite have presented evidence ( from physical arguments and from the observed near - absence of any relic radio lobes ) that lobe emission must disappear on relatively rapid timescales . from the similarity between the duty - cycle of intermittent jet activity in microquasars ( their flaring mode ) and the fraction of quasars that are observed to be radio - loud , @xcite posit that radio - loudness is a function of the epoch at which a quasar is observed .",
    "the present paper suggests that when there is no evidence for kpc - scale jets or their lobes , that disappear rapidly following too much expansion , the observed persistence of weak unresolved radio cores is a strong indicator that mass - loss via a disk wind accompanies on - going disk accretion . indeed , it seems increasingly likely that radio - loudness in quasars is a somewhat short - lived phase of enhanced angular momentum loss via jets , analogous to that in microquasars , and that the more common means of angular momentum loss is via longer - lived phases of mass - loss via disk winds . separately from the flaring mode associated with jet - ejection episodes in microquasars , @xcite identify a second , chief mode of energy loss , which they term the  coupled mode \" during which microquasars are observed to have closely coupled x - ray and radio luminosities and to be unresolved  cores \" .",
    "if the quiescent radio core emission is due to a hot ( @xmath82k ) disk wind , then the observed radio / x - ray correlation could be attributed to a common disk origin for the radio ( disk wind ) and soft x - ray ( disk wind + disk blackbody ) emission .",
    "it would be interesting to pursue this analogy further in the context of core emission in quasars and agn ( although in this case , only the disk wind , and not the disk blackbody emission , would contribute to the soft x - ray emission ) and indeed the extent to which the disk wind , if equatorial as in ss433 , plays the role of the putative obscuring torus .    although it is now widely acknowledged that feedback from agn is required to reconcile simulations of galaxy formation with observations , the details of these processes remain to be explored ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , although jets are invoked as a means of relocating mass and energy away from the active galactic nucleus , a limitation of this picture is that jets are by their very nature _ highly directional _ and relatively light .",
    "winds from accretion disks , however , are considerably less directional and heavier and may provide a better means of dispersing mass / energy into the igm and explaining the observed link between growth of supermassive black holes and their host galaxy properties @xcite .",
    "a mass outflow rate ( @xmath83 ) of hot ( @xmath82k ) gas may be sufficient to offset cooling in galaxies .",
    "we have proposed that the radio cores of radio - quiet quasars are thermal in origin , arising from an accretion disk wind .",
    "this wind naturally produces flat spectrum radio emission via optically - thin bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "the remarkable similarities in radio core properties of radio - quiet and ( many ) radio - loud quasars suggests that a radio - emitting disk wind is present at some level in all quasars .",
    "the observed luminosities of radio core emission from quasars implies that they are accreting at super - eddington rates and that the disk wind expels most of this matter well before it reaches the inner accretion flow , thereby providing an efficient mechanism for angular momentum transport and agn feedback .",
