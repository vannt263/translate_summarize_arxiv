    "multiuser detection is the problem of extracting estimations of multiple sources from a shared communication channel  @xcite . in order to most efficiently use the bandwidth",
    "a high load should be used , and many theoretical results indicate achievable capacities are good in this regime for standard code classes .",
    "however , increasing load forces users to share bandwidth and creates a strongly correlated inference problem , for which optimal detection may not be possible by practical ( fast ) detectors . even in the limit of zero noise in the channel ,",
    "multi - access interference may prevent a jointly or individually optimal ( jo / io ) estimation of the sources .",
    "code division multiple access ( cdma ) is a method of bandwidth allocation in which each of @xmath0 users is assigned a code ( @xmath1 ) by which to modulate a symbol on the bandwidth of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) orthogonal time / frequency blocks ( chips ) , @xmath4 is called the load .",
    "the scenario of a noiseless multi - access channel is examined in this paper for ensembles of sparse random codes .",
    "the sparse codes examined have the advantage that they can be assigned independently at random to all users , and are known to have a good performance in additive white gaussian noise channels ( awgnc ) , combined with belief propagation ( bp ) decoding  @xcite .    using only unit clause propagation ( ucp )  @xcite all source may be determined efficiently for @xmath4 up to some discontinuous transition point beyond which detection by decimation becomes suddenly inefficient .",
    "the noiseless threshold results provide bounds on achievable detection and may guide the development of algorithms . features of this transition may be relevant to decimation based detectors in a variety of sparsely coded noisy channels .",
    "for awgnc at standard operating power levels ( signal to noise ratio @xmath5db ) the departure of the signal from the noiseless case is quite small and threshold behaviour in the noiseless system may have a dominating effect on detector performance .",
    "a standard synchronous cdma model has each user transmitting a modulated bit @xmath6 , the sources interfere to give a signal @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents channel noise .",
    "different encodings may be represented as graphical inference structures , as shown in figure [ fig : figure1 ] .",
    "weakly correlated codes , such as orthogonal codes create computationally easy detection problems , at high loads , or with poorly chosen codes , detection may be hard .    for many noise models , including the noiseless limit ,",
    "a maximum capacity can be achieved by minimising overlaps in user codes @xmath9  @xcite , orthogonal codes are a solution when @xmath10 . however , creating maximum distance codes is computationally expensive as @xmath4 increases , and the allocation of codes can be inflexible .    in realistic operating conditions synchronisation of users may not be possible , and codes must be made robust against a number of phenomena . furthermore a small loss in capacity might be tolerable in order to achieve greater flexibility in the code allocation , or efficiency in the detection process . for this reason codes sampled independently from code ensemble",
    "are often considered .",
    "random codes in which every user accesses @xmath3 chips with a unique modulation pattern imply inference structures described by dense graphs  @xcite , and these have become favoured in theory and practice . more recently it has been argued that sparse codes , where each user accesses only @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) chips might have some favourable properties  @xcite , particularly due to the efficiency of bp and message passing .",
    "analysis by tanaka  @xcite suggests that for dense codes in the asymptotic case of many user and large bandwidth , limits of @xmath13 exist above which io ( jo ) detection is not expected to be efficient due to suboptimal attractors for detector dynamics , even in the noiseless limit . in a variety of experiments",
    "based on bp , and heuristic decoding , the @xmath14 regime indeed proves to be difficult  @xcite for sparse codes .",
    "the majority of practical detectors have efficient working regimes restricted to @xmath15 .    in this paper",
    "the origins of this hardness at large load are investigated for sparse codes in a noiseless channel .",
    "ucp is found to be sufficient to produce a jointly optimal detection of the bits in some range of @xmath4 , so that perfect detection is possible for loads up to some critical threshold depending on user connectivity .",
    "the breakdown of the ucp detector is sudden and leaves a residual problem without an obvious solution , the residual problem has many properties characteristic of hard constraint satisfaction problems  @xcite .",
    "the set of codes examined are sparse so that each user transmits on only a fraction @xmath16 of chips , binary phase shift keying ( bpsk ) is used so the marginal is @xmath17 each non - zero transmission is a binary modulation @xmath18 .",
    "the degeneracy problem central to this paper can be avoided by choosing another modulation pattern , but degeneracy becomes a problem for such schemes as soon as realistic noise is introduced .    in the poissonian ensemble",
    "each chip is accessed in an independent manner , unfortunately some users end up transmitting on no chips in this ensemble . in the more practical regular ensemble",
    "all users access exactly @xmath11 chips so that @xmath19 in the limit of large @xmath3 the case @xmath20 has properties distinguishable from the dense case due to dilution effects .",
    "the inference problem in the noiseless channel consists of examining the signal and determining an estimation of the sent bits ( @xmath21 ) consistent with the model ( [ eq : vy ] ) .",
    "the value of some bits might only be determined by looking at the entire signal , but other bits may be implied from only one chip . each chip determined by @xmath22 user contributions , with signal @xmath23 ,",
    "can be interpreted as a logical clause .",
    "some clauses allow degenerate solutions when considered in isolation , others imply unique solutions . if a user @xmath24 is the only transmission on chip @xmath25 for example , then @xmath26 and any consistent estimate requires @xmath27 , regardless of other chips on which @xmath24 transmits .",
    "the logical implication is a unit / atomic clause in the variable @xmath24 .",
    "similarly a chip combining @xmath22 interfering transmissions determines all the incident users ( through @xmath22 unit clauses ) if the signal is extremal @xmath28 .",
    "otherwise the solution is degenerate , allowing several consistent assignments of incidents bits .",
    "ucp produces an estimate by decimating variables contained in unit clauses and is a central process in many complete detectors . by iteratively removing the unit clauses the remaining degenerate clauses , which form a simplified inference problem ( residual graph ) ,",
    "may be modified and create additional unit clauses . if insufficient unit clauses exist at some point in the algorithm , one can guess a value at random , or using some more advanced inference , and ucp checks the logical implications of this guess .",
    "a consequence of guessing is that one may produce contradictory unit clauses at some later point in the algorithm , a consistent ( jo ) solution is not possible where contradictions occur .",
    "however , guessing may not need to coincide exactly with the bit sequence for a jo detection , it may be that several solutions exist for a given signal .",
    "this is an undesirable scenario for practical purposes , but possible at high load .",
    "the initial set of unit clauses is found by taking all chips for which @xmath29 and converting each to @xmath30 unit clauses .",
    "the set of unit clauses @xmath31 is populated , while this set is non - empty , and includes no contradictions , the algorithm proceeds deterministically in two steps .    in the first step a variable",
    "is decimated : select a variable @xmath24 represented in @xmath31 , set its value @xmath32 according to the unit clause(s ) and remove unit clauses in variable @xmath24 from @xmath31 . reevaluate the signal on all chips on which user @xmath24 transmitted : @xmath33 , and then remove ( set to zero ) @xmath34 for all @xmath25 .",
    "variable @xmath24 is removed from the problem leaving a residual graph .",
    "let @xmath35 be the the number of variables assigned in this way , the decimation time , so that @xmath36 in this step .    in the second step modifications to the residual graph",
    "are considered , chips formerly degenerate may now be informative .",
    "for every chip modified in the first step check whether @xmath37 , if this condition is met then the inference is no longer ambiguous and a unit clause is created and added to the set @xmath31 , for each non - zero @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath31 is empty then a variable is chosen and a unit clause is created and added to the set @xmath31 . in the simplest scenario the variable ( @xmath24 ) and assignment @xmath38 are chosen uniformly at random . once the first such guess is made it is necessary to keep track of contradictions .",
    "if a unit clause is added to the set @xmath31 that is in contradiction with an existing unit clause the algorithm may proceed to termination by ignoring the new unit clause , but the estimate obtained is not jo .",
    "the algorithm completes after @xmath0 decimations , either with the unique jo estimation ( if no guesses were required ) , a jo estimation ( if guesses were required , but no contradictions encountered ) , or an approximation ( if contradictions were encountered ) .",
    "if a jo solution is required the algorithm may be modified so as to back - track and reevaluate previous guesses when contradictions are encountered .",
    "an example of the algorithm in action for the third scenario is shown in figure [ fig : example63 ] for an experiment with @xmath39 , @xmath40 , a random bit sequence , and codes sampled from the regular ensemble ( [ eq : regular ] ) .",
    "up to a time @xmath41 the algorithm is deterministic , and up to a time @xmath42 no contradictions are encountered . between @xmath41 and @xmath42 a small fraction of variables must be guessed , the bit error rate ( ber ) increases linearly in expectation from the first guess .",
    "many contradictions arise later in the algorithm , implied by the small number of guesses .",
    "experimentation indicates a self - averaging effect for large @xmath0 that can be analysed throughout the deterministic stage of the algorithm ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this is possible by assuming a concentration process in the various extensive statistics of the residual graph  @xcite , and the extensive population of distinct unit clauses , the important extensive properties are illustrated in figure [ fig : graphstructure ] .",
    "the poissonian ensemble is analysed for brevity , the regular ensemble derivation is more subtle and outlined in appendix [ sec : regularensemble ] .    in the poissonian ensemble",
    "the number of chips with @xmath44 incident users is poissonian distributed , parameterised by @xmath22 ( @xmath45 ) , a finite upper bound is assumed for the largest relevant chip @xmath46 . of chips containing @xmath44 contributions ,",

    "this number , at @xmath50 , is the probability of a zero in the poisson distribution parameterised by the total number of variables incident on chips of type @xmath28 .",

    "therefore a variable decimated from the set of unit clauses is incident in chips of length @xmath44 a number of times proportional to length @xmath44 , and inversely proportional to the number of remaining variables @xmath54 .",
    "this clause may become either a smaller clause , or a set of @xmath55 unit clauses , the later with probability @xmath56 ( independent of @xmath35 ) .",
    "the population @xmath49 is modified according to @xmath57 except for @xmath58 where the second term is absent .",
    "this applies intuitively at the first decimation time @xmath50 , but it is also true at all @xmath35 .",
    "variables which become unit clauses through the process of decimation do so at a rate proportional to their connectivity , and are represented in the residual graph with a frequency determined by their excess connectivity distribution . for the poisson ensemble these are both the same and whether a variable is represented zero or several times in the set of unit clauses does not effect its distribution in the residual graph .",

    "may be solved as an exponential form .",
    "roots of @xmath70 in the interval @xmath72 can be determined numerically .",
    "unfortunately the equation for the regular ensemble are not so easily solved .",
    "one must keep track of the dynamics for variables of different degeneracies in @xmath31 , the number of variables appearing @xmath73 times as unit clauses is @xmath74 , where @xmath73 runs from @xmath75 to @xmath11 . a variable present in @xmath31",
    "occurs less frequently in the residual graph , which must be accounted for in ( [ eq : deltaphi ] ) , and the new unit clauses contribute to the populations @xmath76 in a non - linear fashion . including initial conditions one can again write a set of differential equations , but",
    "these must be solved by numerical integration .",
    "fortunately the dynamics are smooth and fourth order runge - kutta methods seem to produce a good determination of the critical point , @xmath77 .",

    "figure [ fig : scalingc3 ] shows that there is a discontinuous jump in @xmath77 as @xmath4 increases , the guessing stage goes from being empty to forming a large fraction of the algorithm run - time , and the terminal residual graph ( trg ) goes from empty at @xmath77 to a giant loopy graph . at small @xmath4 and @xmath11 greater than @xmath80 there is only a deterministic phase and determining the unique jo detection ( also io ) is trivial ( @xmath81 ) . similarly below the percolation threshold ,",
    "the solution ceases to be unique , finding one of the degenerate solutions remains easy ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) .",
    "finally at large @xmath4 and @xmath11 , the algorithm involves a non - deterministic phase , and generates contradictions ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "this latter regime dominates for large @xmath11 for finite @xmath4 . at large @xmath4 and finite @xmath11",
    "one can expect degeneracy in the solutions , but close to the transition the embedded solution is expected to remain the unique jo solution , only difficult to find by ucp .",
    "the three regimes can be bounded in a phase diagram as shown in figure  [ fig : ensemble1 ] . up to the range of @xmath4",
    "shown it is found that perfect decoding ( ber@xmath85 ) coincides with @xmath83 , except at small @xmath11 .",
    "the jo solution is unique and trivial to find at small load .",
    "the case of a poissonian ensemble is examined briefly in appendix  [ sec : poissonian ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : example63 ] shows properties typical of the regime in which the non - deterministic method exists . for computational complexity reasons the gap @xmath86 is most important .",
    "if this is not asymptotically @xmath75 , then with high probability @xmath61 guesses have been made in reaching a contradiction .",
    "the cost of backtracking , reevaluating @xmath87 combinations to find the correct branch , is not feasible and ucp becomes an efficient jo estimator .    in order to understand the algorithm failure it is useful to consider the trg structure . in the regular case",
    "the graph consists of a c - core , every variable is connected to exactly c degenerate chips , each chip implying a constraint .",
    "these constraints are of many types , comparable to 2-xor , 1-in-3 sat  @xcite , and others .",
    "the clauses are _ locked _  at least two variables in any clause must be changed to go from one solution to another .",
    "random constraint satisfaction problems ( csp ) of a similar specification have been much studied in physics  @xcite .",
    "increasing the ratio of logical constraints to variables ( @xmath88 ) often leads to a sharp transition in the ability to find any solution ( sat transition ) buffered by a computationally hard regime .",
    "the case studied is topologically similar to a csp , but the embedded solution changes the nature of the transition  @xcite , and it is difficult to establish the extent of this effect .",
    "there is always a ( ber@xmath89 ) jo solution , but one may asymptotically expect a sharp transition from a computationally easy regime for jo detection , to a computationally difficult one in which the solution is still unique , and then towards regimes with many solutions ( poor performance even with an ideal detector ) . it may be argued that the transition is a peculiarity of the ucp decoder and the bpsk modulation scheme ( which introduces degeneracy ) .",
    "it also seems likely that for trgs with unique solutions methods such as bp decimation may be successful beyond the ucp threshold in typical case with some high probability .",
    "certainly the critical @xmath4 decreases with @xmath11 , whereas algorithms are known to perform well up to @xmath15 in practice .",
    "however , for small @xmath11 the thresholds for @xmath4 outlined in this paper seem to match quite well transitions in the equilibrium solution spaces for noisy systems  @xcite , which may indicate a common phenomena .",
    "the effect of noise might be considered for an erasure channel without fundamentally changing the analysis  @xcite . in an erasure channel a fraction of chips",
    "are removed , guessing becomes necessary and degeneracy is introduced . for the poissonian ensemble",
    "the random erasure of chips is equivalent to working with a new code parameterised by larger @xmath4 .",
    "however , for the sparse code any small number of erasures has an important immediate effect : the trg 2-core cease to be the entire graph and there is no longer a unique solution ( ber@xmath89 ) .",
    "the poissonian code development scheme of figure  [ fig : figure3 ] is applicable .",
    "nevertheless , a sharp ucp transition in @xmath4 is still observed between a computationally easy tree - like trg ( analogous to the @xmath90 scenario ) and the non - trivial loopy trg , except for small @xmath11 and/or many erasures .",
    "discontinuous transitions in optimal , or heuristically determined , bit error rates are common with increasing noise in cdma detection models .",
    "erasures within the noiseless framework introduce additional degeneracy in the solution space .",
    "it seems reasonable to expect that a critical number of erasures might cause a discontinuous jump in the ber applying to a typical jointly optimal solution , related to the solution space on the core of the trg .",
    "an equilibrium statistical mechanics approach may be most effective at uncovering such features .",
    "unit clauses propagation is an important component in many solution finders and seems particularly well adapted for sparse cdma , providing a guaranteed jointly optimal performance across a range of parameters . this high performance may be established in typical case by analytic methods . in this paper",
    "it is argued that the failure of ucp in the noiseless case for large systems , due to multi - access interference at high load , characterises an asymptotically limiting regime for all fast algorithms due to fundamental topological and solution space features of the inference problem .",
    "understanding the residual graph problem in greater detail might provide insight for sparse codes and , if solved , a basis for selection of principled detection methods at high load . a basis for this analysis may be found in recent statistical physics research on locked constraint satisfaction problems .",
    "this research is partly supported by the research grants council of hong kong ( grant no . hkust 604008 ) .",
    "the mean dynamics for the regular user connectivity ensemble are developed along similar lines to those presented in the main text , expanding the explanation on certain points . at decimation time",
    "@xmath35 typical ensemble dynamics are described sufficiently by @xmath49 and @xmath74 .",
    "the latter term describes the number of variables present @xmath73 times in the set of unit clauses ( including those that are absent @xmath91 ) . during the deterministic phase unit clauses",
    "exist , the critical criteria demarking this algorithmic stage is @xmath92 selecting a variable independently of its degeneracy , leads to a decrease in the number of degenerate unit clauses , therefore decimation contributes to the dynamics according to @xmath93 for all non - zero @xmath73 .",
    "the number of residual graph variables associated to a unit clause depends on its degeneracy , in the regular ensemble a variable appears @xmath11 times in the unit clauses and residual graph , so the average probability an instance of a variable in the residual graph corresponds to a variable decimated from the set of unit clauses , relative to a uniform sampling of the unit clauses , is @xmath94 variables decimated appear less frequently in the residual graph than the mean .",
    "a clause population may grow with the removal of a variable , as larger degenerate clauses become smaller degenerate clauses , or become smaller as the population is reduced .",
    "a variable is coincident with a clause in proportion to its size the dynamic in expectation is @xmath95 the @xmath96 dependent term is absent for the special case @xmath58 . in the large system limit @xmath46 is not finite , but choosing a finite value generates only a very small systematic error .",

    "the distribution of clauses of type @xmath100 is binomial at time @xmath50 , and can be shown by iteration to remain so at later times for the degenerate clauses , hence the simple form of @xmath56 .",
    "each reduction of a large clause to a non - degenerate clause creates @xmath101 unit clauses .",
    "these new unit clauses coincide with variables in the set @xmath102 in proportion to @xmath103 , for example a variable @xmath11 times degenerate in the unit clauses can not be represented in the graph ( since it only appears @xmath11 times in the problem before decimation ) .",
