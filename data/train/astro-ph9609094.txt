    "the optical and uv emission of radio - quiet active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is dominated by a quasi - thermal component , the  big blue bump \" ( shields 1978 , malkan & sargent 1982 , malkan 1983 ) . the big blue bump is usually interpreted as thermal emission from a geometrically thin , optically thick , accretion disk around a massive black hole ( malkan 1983 , sun & malkan 1989 , laor & netzer 1989 : ln89 ) .",
    "this model makes two key predictions .",
    "first , the large jump in the absorptive opacity at the lyman edge combined with the vertical temperature gradients in the disk insure that some feature will be present at the lyman edge ( kolykhalov & sunyaev 1984 , ln89 ) . for the same reason , some have predicted that the polarization of the disk should decrease at frequencies above the lyman edge ( laor , netzer & piran 1990 ; but see blaes & agol 1996 for another view ) .",
    "second , variations in different portions of the optical / ultraviolet band can be associated with fluctuations in the conditions at particular radii .",
    "if fluctuations move radially through the disk , there should be time - delays between variations seen at different wavelengths which correspond to signal travel times within the disk .",
    "unfortunately , while this picture is very attractive , it suffers from severe problems , both theoretical and observational . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", it is generally expected that the viscous stress is proportional to the pressure ( the  @xmath9-model \" introduced by shakura & sunyaev 1973 : ss73 ) , including the radiation pressure when the disk is optically thick .",
    "unfortunately , if this is true , when the accretion rate is more than a small fraction of the eddington rate , the disk is thermally unstable throughout its inner region ( shakura & sunyaev 1976 ) . for this reason ,",
    "the most detailed disk spectral calculations made to date ( ln89 ) supposed that the stress was instead proportional to the geometric mean of the gas and radiation pressures .    in addition , neither of the two key predictions just described is confirmed by observations .",
    "partial lyman edges have been detected in very few agn ( antonucci , kinney & ford 1989 ; koratkar , kinney & bohlin 1992 ) and the polarization of two quasars with partial absorption edges _ rises _ across the lyman edge ( koratkar , 1995 ) .",
    "intensive monitoring of the type 1 seyfert galaxy ngc 5548 revealed that variations from the optical to the far - uv are tightly correlated .",
    "the signal travel speed through a conventional disk that would be required to coordinate these variations was found to be at least @xmath10 , far higher than any of the expected signal speeds ( krolik 1991 ) .",
    "moreover , variations in the soft x - ray flux have been found to be almost as tightly correlated with ultraviolet fluctuations ( clavel , 1992 ) .",
    "these two findings suggest that the big blue bump may actually be due to reprocessed x - ray emission ( rokaki , collin - souffrin , & magnan 1993 ) .",
    "other evidence also points to the importance of x - ray reprocessing in the formation of agn continua . in many type",
    "1 seyfert galaxies , there is a spectral feature in the vicinity of 10  30 kev which is readily interpreted as  compton reflection \" of x - rays from a cool , optically thick surface occupying roughly half of the solid angle around the x - ray source ( pounds 1990 ) .",
    "it would be very natural to interpret this reflector as an accretion disk ( lightman & white 1988 ) ( but a number of other interpretations are also possible : nandra & george 1994 ; krolik , madau , & @xmath11 1994 ; ghisellini , haardt & matt 1994 ) .",
    "further support for the thought that the disk is subjected to intense x - ray irradiation comes from the discovery that the fe k@xmath9 profiles in many agn are extremely broad ( as summarized by nandra 1997 ) .",
    "recently popular models for the production of the x - rays are also consistent with this picture in which a large fraction of the emitted x - rays strike a nearby cool surface , possibly the accretion disk ( haardt & maraschi 1993 : hm93 ; haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ; pietrini & krolik 1995 ; stern 1995 ) .",
    "these models suppose that a large part of the disk s dissipation takes place in a small amount of mass at or above the disk s surface .",
    "the very large heating rate per unit mass in an optically thin gas creates a very hot corona which cools by inverse compton scattering .",
    "roughly half the x - ray flux generated strikes the disk , and is reprocessed into uv photons which then return to the corona as seeds for inverse compton scattering .",
    "fits to the broad - band x - ray spectra of agn are at least qualitatively consistent with this sort of thermal comptonization model ( e.g. zdziarski 1995 ) .    in its simplest form",
    ", the corona model predicts that the observed uv flux should be roughly equal to the observed intrinsic x - ray flux ( i.e. the x - ray flux after subtracting any components due to reprocessing ) . whether this prediction is consistent with the observations is uncertain .",
    "the uv / x - ray flux ratio is conventionally parameterized by @xmath12 , the spectral index of a power - law interpolated between 2500 and 2 kev , as measured in the agn rest - frame .",
    "depending on the sample definition , the observed distribution of @xmath12 varies somewhat , but typically it ranges from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , with a tendency for lower luminosity agn to have smaller @xmath12 ( stocke et al . 1991 ; wilkes et al . 1994 ; green et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the flux at at 2500 is @xmath15 times the flux at 2 kev so that , if we compare at these two frequencies alone , we would conclude that the uv luminosity exceeds the x - ray luminosity in most agn .",
    "however , to find the ratio of the total uv and x - ray fluxes , substantial  and very uncertain  bolometric corrections must be applied to both .",
    "we can not observe low - redshift agn in the rest - frame euv , but composite high - redshift quasar spectra ( e.g. zheng et al . 1996 ) suggest that the spectrum rolls over sharply at wavelengths shorter than @xmath16   .",
    "if this shape is general , the uv bolometric correction ( relative to @xmath17 at 2500 ) might be as small as @xmath18 , but there is likely to be a considerable dispersion from case to case .",
    "the x - ray bolometric correction is similarly uncertain .",
    "those low luminosity agn for which osse has been able to obtain spectra typically show power - laws with indices @xmath19 across the hard x - ray range , supplemented by a substantial bump at a few tens of kev which is generally believed to be due to reprocessing ( zdziarski et al .",
    "if that power - law extends from 0.5 to 200 kev , the bolometric correction relative to @xmath17 at 2 kev is 6.5 . taking these bolometric corrections at face value , we would conclude that the uv and x - ray fluxes in low luminosity agn ( where the evidence for the corona model is best ) are indeed close to being equal , while the uv flux is typically rather greater than the intrinsic x - ray flux in higher luminosity agn .",
    "however , it is clear from the character of this estimate that it is very weakly based .",
    "the situation is made still cloudier by the possibility that relativistic effects may direct the majority of the emitted x - rays toward the disk , reducing the observed ratio between x - rays and uv ( martocchia and matt 1996 ) .",
    "it is our goal to begin the process of testing these coronal models by comparing the ultraviolet spectrum they predict with observations . in this paper",
    "we develop the techniques necessary to compute the predicted uv spectra , and apply them to the simplest version of the model : that in which _ all _ the dissipation takes place in a slab - like corona resting directly on top of the accretion disk . in future work",
    "we will examine other variations , such as models in which the dissipation is shared between the disk proper and the corona , and models with more complicated coronal geometry .",
    "an immediate consequence of this picture in which most of the dissipation takes place in a corona , and not inside the disk proper , is that radiation pressure support in the bulk of the disk is far weaker than in a conventional disk .",
    "the radiation force is simply the product of the radiation flux and the opacity ; where there is no outgoing flux ( because there is no internal heat generation ) , there can be no radiation force . as a result ,",
    "such disks collapse to a state of much greater density ( and also column density ) than would be predicted by conventional models ( svensson & zdziarski 1995 : sz95 ) .",
    "they are then supported primarily by gas pressure , and ( in the @xmath9-model ) are thermally stable .",
    "it is also an immediate corollary that these disks are very nearly isothermal  zero outward flux in an optically thick environment implies constant temperature .",
    "some analogous work has been done in the past .",
    "a number of groups ( e.g. ross & fabian 1993 ; @xmath20 1994 ) have computed the spectra of x - ray irradiated disks , but all have assumed the disks are radiation pressure supported . because disks in which most dissipation is in a corona are much denser than conventional radiation pressure - supported disks , the character of the uv spectrum they produce is quite different from what has been predicted by assuming a conventional disk structure .",
    "others have tried to predict the uv spectra radiated by dense lumps heated by x - rays ( guilbert & rees 1988 , ferland & rees 1988 ) .    in  [",
    "sec : isothermal disk ] we solve the structure equations for x - ray irradiated disks .",
    "the solution of the radiative transfer and vertical structure equations in the x - ray heated skin is described in  [ sec : xray skin ] and our results are summarized in  [",
    "sec : results ] the gravitational stability of the cold disk is discussed in  [",
    "sec : gravitational instability ] we conclude in  [ sec : conclusions ]",
    "when there is no internal dissipation ( sz95 treat the case in which the dissipation is shared between the disk and the corona ) , the main body of the disk is rigorously isothermal , as explained in  1 .",
    "the radial structure of geometrically thin isothermal accretion disks is defined by two equations : the conservation of angular momentum @xmath21 and the inter - ring stress prescription , for which we use the @xmath9-model : @xmath22 vertical structure is determined by hydrostatic equilibrium : @xmath23 and the isothermal equation of state .",
    "the symbols in these equations represent the mass of the central black hole ( @xmath24 ) , the mass accretion rate ( @xmath25 ) , the keplerian angular velocity ( @xmath26 ) , the vertically integrated shear stress ( @xmath27 ) , the radial coordinate ( @xmath28 ) , the vertical coordinate ( @xmath29 ) , the gas density ( @xmath30 ) , the gas pressure ( @xmath31 ) , the sound speed in the gas ( @xmath32 ) , the surface mass density @xmath33 and the dimensionless stress @xmath34 .",
    "the general relativistic correction factors are taken from the standard references .",
    "the subscript nt refers to the novikov and thorne ( 1973 , page & thorne 1974 ) expressions and the subscript rh refers to the recent corrections presented by rifferts & herrold ( 1995 ) .",
    "these equations are easily solved .",
    "the integrated surface mass density is @xmath35 and the density profile is gaussian @xmath36 with a scale height of @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the gas temperature in the accretion disk .",
    "the normalization of the density , @xmath39 is set by assuming that all the mass lies in the isothermal inner disk .",
    "it is instructive to express the disk solution in terms of nondimensional parameters @xmath40 where we have introduced the eddington accretion rate @xmath41 and the schwarzschild radius @xmath42 the electron scattering opacity is @xmath43 .",
    "the numerical factors have been calculated by assuming an accretion efficiency of @xmath44 , which is appropriate for a non - rotating black hole .",
    "using these scalings we find that @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 there are two important things to note about these results .",
    "first , the total surface mass density is many orders of magnitude larger than the penetration depth of the hard x - rays .",
    "consequently , supposing the bulk of the disk to be isothermal and gas pressure - supported is an excellent approximation .",
    "second , the gas density of the isothermal disk is very much larger than the @xmath48  gm @xmath49 typical of conventional radiation pressure supported disks ( ss73 ) .",
    "few x - rays can penetrate much greater than the compton depth @xmath50  gm  @xmath51 . on the other hand , as shown by equation 12 , these disks are extremely optically thick to compton scattering .",
    "consequently , there are essentially no x - rays below @xmath52^{1/2 } \\simeq 3 $ ] ",
    "the exact number of scale heights above the midplane where the x - ray - heated skin begins depends only slightly on parameters . in this estimate , and all the numerical work , we set @xmath54 for definiteness , but it hardly affects the results at all .      inside the x - ray - heated skin , the temperature , pressure , and radiation intensity are determined as functions of altitude by solving the differential equations for radiative transfer , @xmath55 hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath56 and the surface mass density @xmath57 subject to the local constraints of radiative equilibrium @xmath58 and charge conservation @xmath59 equations [ eq : radiative transfer ] , [ eq : hydrostatic equilibrium ] , [ eq : surface mass density ] , [ eq : radiative equilibrium ] , [ eq : charge conservation ] are solved for the mean ultraviolet intensity ( @xmath60 ) , gas pressure ( @xmath31 ) , gas temperature ( @xmath61 ) , electron density ( @xmath62 ) and vertical coordinate ( @xmath29 ) as functions of the surface mass density .",
    "the other symbols represent the x - ray heating rate ( @xmath63 , see  [ subsec : heating rate ] ) , total opacity ( @xmath64 ) , the absorptive opacity ( @xmath65 ) , the emissivity ( @xmath66 ) , the variable eddington factors ( @xmath67 ) , the number density of ion species @xmath68 in ionization state @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) and the maximum ionization state of species @xmath68 ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "we assume that the disk is geometrically thin and neglect self - gravity of the disk . under these assumptions ,",
    "the gravitational acceleration of the material in the disk is ( rifferts & herrold 1995 ) @xmath72 the gravitational force of the underlying isothermal disk can contribute to the net acceleration of material in the skin but the contribution is small ( see the discussion in  [ sec : isothermal disk ] ) .",
    "the momentum of the absorbed x - rays is transferred to the gas , resulting in an additional force directed towards the disk midplane .",
    "the gradient of the hard x - ray radiation pressure is @xmath73 in the eddington approximation , which we have used to solve for @xmath63 (  [ subsec : heating rate ] ) .",
    "the total opacity includes bremsstrahlung , photoionization and electron scattering .",
    "we neglect all line opacities .",
    "the expression for the free - free opacity is taken from rybicki & lightman ( 1979 ) and the general expression for the photo - ionization opacity is from mihalas ( 1978 ) .",
    "the bound - free oscillator strengths of hi and heii are calculated using the analytic formulae for hydrogen - like atoms ( mihalas 1978 ) and the hei oscillator strengths are from bell & kingston ( 1967 ) .",
    "we calculate the number densities of electrons , hi , hii , hei , heii and heiii assuming saha equilibrium , local thermodynamic equilibrium , and hydrogen and helium abundances of x=0.9 and y=0.1 , respectively .",
    "explicit photoionization and recombination are not included in the calculation of the ionization state .",
    "we compute the emissivity using the corresponding continuum cooling processes : bremsstrahlung and hi , hei , and heii radiative recombination .",
    "the gas density in the x - ray heated layer is high enough that we expect resonance line cooling to be suppressed .",
    "resonance lines are thermalized when the collisional deexcitation rate is greater than the product of the radiation rate and the photon escape probability .",
    "neglecting stimulated emission , this occurs when the fractional abundance of the lower state @xmath74 satisfies the inequality @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the electron density in units of @xmath77 @xmath49 , @xmath78 is the column density of h atoms in units of @xmath79 @xmath51 , and @xmath80 the masses of the atom and proton , respectively .",
    "these scalings were chosen because the gas density at 3.5 scale heights from the midplane is typically @xmath81 @xmath49 and 2 kev photons are absorbed at a column density @xmath82 @xmath51 .",
    "when the temperature is @xmath83  k uv and euv lines are the important potential coolants , but the only lines which contribute to the cooling are those with very low abundance lower states .    by contrast , the density in the atmosphere of an irradiated radiation pressure supported disk is characteristically four orders of magnitude lower .",
    "this means that the ionization parameter is so much greater that a thermal runaway is triggered , and soft x - ray lines are the most important transitions for cooling . due to the combination of lower density and higher radiation rates , emission lines are much more important in the thermal balance in this context than in our limit of the zero internal dissipation disk .    in principle , the complete angular dependent radiative transport problem can be solved by introducing variable eddington factors ( mihalas 1978 ) .",
    "the computational overhead associated with an iterative calculation of the eddington factors is fairly large and , given the other approximations we have made , probably unwarranted .",
    "instead , we adopt a simple parametrization @xmath84 where @xmath85 which has the correct limiting behavior ( g. s. miller , private communication ) .",
    "we perform an iterative calculation of @xmath67 for one set of disk parameters in  [ subsubsec : angular distribution ] and use this solution to test the accuracy of the analytic prescription .",
    "the complete system of equations is solved by transforming the differential equations into finite - difference equations , linearizing with respect to all variables , and relaxing from an initial solution .",
    "we solve the structure equations for a grey atmosphere with a shooting procedure ( press , 1992 ) and use this solution as a first guess for the relaxation method .",
    "the only significant difference between our work and the standard stellar atmosphere calculation ( mihalas 1978 , rybicki 1971 ) is the non - zero heating rate ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : radiative equilibrium ] ) .",
    "we assume that all the energy dissipated due to accretion at radius @xmath28 is released as heat in the corona .",
    "the rate per unit area is @xmath86 and this is converted into an x - ray flux by inverse compton scattering of the uv photons emerging from the disk ( hm93 ) .",
    "one - half of this flux illuminates the underlying disk . in terms of the dimensionless parameters defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : disk parameter scalings ] @xmath87    the spectrum of the illuminating flux is taken to be @xmath88 where @xmath89 .",
    "a self - consistent calculation of the x - ray spectrum is beyond the scope of this paper , so we simply assume @xmath90 , as is commonly observed ( zdziarski 1995 ) .",
    "the exponential cut - off is meant to mimic the sharp rise in the x - ray albedo above 10  kev ( lightman & white 1988 ) . as a result of the high albedo for harder photons ,",
    "they are mostly reflected and do not contribute to the heating rate . still harder photons ( @xmath91  kev ) lose much of their energy in recoil , but because there are many uncertainties in our knowledge of the high energy spectrum in agn ( zdziarski 1995 ) , and because the expected contribution to the net heating is small and depends sensitively on the high energy spectrum ( p. @xmath92 , private communication ) , we neglect this contribution .",
    "we also suppose that there is no sub - structure to the corona ; the local heating rate could vary substantially if the dissipation is concentrated in active regions ( haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ) .",
    "these complications will be addressed in later work .",
    "given this simple parametrization , the heating rate is a well - defined function of the surface mass density @xmath93 where the effective x - ray absorption opacity is defined as ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) @xmath94 ^{1/2}.\\ ] ] and @xmath43 is the electron scattering opacity .",
    "the x - ray opacity in this energy range is dominated by photoionization of oxygen and iron ( london , mccray & auer 1981 ) .",
    "the threshold energy for k - shell photoionization depends upon the ionization state of the gas ( daltabuit & cox 1972 ) which is largely determined by the incident x - ray flux ( lightman & white 1988 , @xmath92 , 1994 ) . a careful calculation of the ionization balance of the heavy elements is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "instead , we assume threshold energies of 0.8 kev and 8.0 kev for oxygen and iron , respectively , and solar abundances of these elements .",
    "the x - ray opacity can then be estimated as @xmath95 using absorption cross - sections for hydrogen - like atoms ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "this approximate description slightly underestimates the absorptive opacity in most of the x - ray - heated atmosphere , where most medium - z atoms retain some valence shell electrons .",
    "the expression for @xmath63 ( eq . [ eq : local heating rate ] ) is equivalent to a two - stream solution for the radiative transfer equation in the eddington approximation .",
    "this approximation is reasonable because the incident hard x - rays are nearly isotropic in the lower hemisphere and electron scattering in the disk will tend to isotropize the x - rays . the heating rate at lower @xmath96 is probably underestimated in this approximation because x - rays incident at large angles will be absorbed at smaller @xmath96 .",
    "the local heating rate is calculated by integrating equation [ eq : local heating rate ] numerically and the results for the assumed x - ray spectrum are plotted in fig [ fig : xray heating rate ] .",
    "the overall scale of the heating rate depends upon the accretion parameters , but the @xmath96 dependence is the same for all the models . at low column densities ,",
    "the heating rate is almost independent of depth because all x - ray frequencies are optically thin .",
    "when @xmath97gm",
    "@xmath98  gm  @xmath51 , @xmath99 because photons of energy @xmath100 are absorbed at the depth @xmath101 . at @xmath102",
    "gm  @xmath51 , the x - ray flux is exponentially attenuated and the heating rate falls rapidly .",
    "the analytic approximation @xmath103 is also plotted in fig . [",
    "fig : xray heating rate ] . here",
    "@xmath96 is measured in units of gm  @xmath51 .",
    "the boundary between the x - ray heated skin and the isothermal disk is set at @xmath104 .",
    "the x - ray heating rate at the boundary is negligible ( @xmath105 ) and we assume no dissipation in the cold disk , so @xmath106 at the inner boundary .",
    "the gas temperature is taken to be continuous across the boundary and the inner boundary conditions on the gas pressure and vertical coordinate are fixed by requiring that the numerical solution for the skin match the analytic solution for the isothermal disk at @xmath107 .",
    "the x - ray heated skin has a sharp outer boundary because a thermal runaway occurs at that point ( see  4.1 for a discussion of its physical origin ) .",
    "we designate the column density at this runaway @xmath108 .",
    "its location is found by bisection .",
    "we guess @xmath108 and attempt a solution . if the code converges to a thermally stable solution , @xmath108 is decreased ; if the code fails to converge , it is increased .",
    "this is repeated until the fractional change in @xmath108 is less than a few percent .",
    "we tested a number of methods for determining the location of the thermal runaway and found that the most sensitive test was the convergence of the code .",
    "the outer boundary condition on the mean uv intensity is usually set by assuming that there is no incident intensity at the boundary ( mihalas 1978 ) .",
    "however , in our situation this is not a valid approximation because @xmath108 ( or the compton depth of the corona ) may be large enough to reflect a significant amount of radiation back towards the skin . instead",
    ", we assume that the uv flux remains constant at @xmath109 and that @xmath110 .",
    "we neglect any contribution from the hot corona to the thomson depth at @xmath109 . we also neglect ( except in the global sense that this is the origin of the x - rays ) any frequency change in the uv photons caused by scattering off gas at @xmath109 . under these assumptions",
    ", there is an analytic relation between the mean intensity and the flux ( mihalas 1978 ) which provides our boundary condition @xmath111 where @xmath112 @xmath113 and @xmath114 are exponential integrals . in practice , the final value of @xmath115 and eq .",

    "the inner edge of the x - ray heated skin is 3 - 4 scale heights from the midplane of the isothermal disk .",
    "the thickness of the skin increases slightly with radius but remains @xmath118 of the height of the inner edge ( fig .",
    "[ fig : structure]a ) .",
    "the thin disk approximation is valid at all radii and the geometry of the disk can be determined from the isothermal disk solution (  [ sec : isothermal disk ] ) . the density profile in the isothermal disk",
    "is gaussian so the gas pressure at the inner edge of the skin is much smaller ( typically by @xmath119 four orders of magnitude ) than the central disk pressure .",
    "this pressure is still much larger than the pressure in a fully radiation pressure - supported disk , however . throughout most of the skin ,",
    "the radiation force of the uv photons is great enough to balance gravity and the force of the incident x - ray flux .",
    "the gas pressure is therefore nearly constant for @xmath120 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : structure]b ) . both the x - ray and uv fluxes drop to zero at @xmath121 and a gas pressure gradient forms to support the disk against gravity .",
    "the gas pressure profile joins smoothly to the isothermal disk solution at @xmath107 .    the radiative cooling rate is equal to the x - ray heating rate when the gas is in radiative equilibrium .",
    "therefore , the gas temperature must be greater than the uv radiation temperature because the cooling rate is @xmath122 , where @xmath123 and @xmath124 is the frequency integrated mean intensity of the uv radiation field .",
    "the actual gas temperature profile is determined by three competing effects .",
    "first , the mean intensity , and @xmath125 , decrease from the bottom of the skin to the surface because of the net outward flux .",
    "second , the x - ray heating rate increases from zero at the bottom of the skin to its maximum value at the top .",
    "therefore , @xmath126 at @xmath107 and the difference between the two temperatures increases steadily until @xmath127 at the upper edge of the skin .",
    "third , the gas temperature gradient changes when an opacity jump , such as the lyman edge , becomes transparent ( mihalas 1978 , p. 206 ) .",
    "the gradient can even change sign in some cases , but not in all cases ( see fig . [",
    "fig : structure ] ) .",
    "the relative importance of these three effects depends upon the local gas pressure and temperature .",

    "an example of a typical temperature profile is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure]c .",
    "the gas is optically thick at all frequencies when @xmath121 and the temperature gradient @xmath128 the gradient is slightly greater than 0 ( @xmath61 increases inward ) at @xmath129 , and slightly less than 0 ( @xmath61 increases outward ) for @xmath130 .",
    "the x - ray heating rate increases rapidly at @xmath131 and @xmath38 rises to maintain thermal equilibrium . in this example , the photosphere for frequencies below the lyman edge is at @xmath132 , so the temperature gradient changes sign at this point .",

    "a good example of this effect is seen in the model @xmath140 and @xmath141 ( see fig . [",

    "we estimate @xmath143 by the somewhat crude prescription of assuming that the opacity of the warm layer is unchanged by the thermal runaway .",
    "a more careful treatment would allow for the reduction in photoelectric opacity due to the higher ionization states found there . nonetheless , we believe our global estimate of @xmath143 is not too bad because the shielding effect is only of major importance when @xmath108 is at least @xmath144  gm  @xmath51 .",
    "when @xmath108 is that large , it hardly matters whether the disk proper is shadowed by photoelectric opacity or compton scattering .",

    "the column density of the runaway is insensitive to @xmath3 and @xmath143 varies only slightly when @xmath3 changes by three orders of magnitude .",
    "we caution that these numerical values also depend on the specific x - ray spectral shape we have chosen .",
    "the material above @xmath108 might influence the emergent spectrum by radiating soft x - rays and by comptonizing the uv flux leaving the disk atmosphere .",
    "we can estimate the gas temperature there as @xmath152 ( begelman , mckee & shields 1988 ) , where @xmath153 are the mean intensities of the uv and incident x - rays , respectively , and @xmath154 are the corresponding compton temperatures .",

    "[ fig : localspec2 ] , [ fig : mass spectra ] and [ fig : mdot spectra ] ) .",
    "this , too , is due to the temperature increasing upward ( [ fig : structure]d , [ fig : structure]c ) .",
    "the larger opacity above the edge than below causes the lyman continuum photosphere to lie higher in the atmosphere than the photosphere at frequencies just below the edge .",
    "the higher temperature at the lyman continuum photosphere naturally leads to a greater emergent flux , i.e. an emission feature ( fig .",

    "additional emission features appear at the hei and heii edges in some of the integrated spectra .",
    "the smearing of the edges is caused by doppler boosting of radiation emitted at small @xmath137 .",
    "the amplitude of the lyman edge feature increases with the central mass ( fig .",

    "low pressure gas cools less efficiently because both the bremsstrahlung and photoionization opacities are proportional to @xmath193 .",
    "inefficient cooling leads to larger temperature inversions in the skin .",
    "the ratio @xmath194 remains roughly constant because the ratio of the opacities is independent of @xmath193 .",

    "the observed flux from an accretion disk around a massive black hole depends upon the disk inclination angle .",
    "first , as discussed in the previous paragraph , the emergent flux has an intrinsic angular distribution in the local rest frame ( see below ) .",
    "second , there are a number of relativistic effects acting upon photons emitted from material orbiting near the black hole .",
    "relativistic orbital motion boosts their frequencies and collimates their directions , while the strong gravitational field bends their trajectories and imposes a gravitational redshift on their frequencies as viewed at large distance ( cunningham 1975 ) .",
    "the boosting and beaming due to orbital motion tend to be stronger than the gravitational effects , so the net result is to strengthen the radiation emitted close to the equatorial plane from the innermost rings of the disk ( cunningham 1975 , laor , netzer & piran 1990 ) .",
    "these effects are stronger in rotating black holes than in non - rotating black holes because the disk extends closer to the event horizon in the former case ( laor , 1990 ) . for this reason ,",
    "the impact of general relativistic effects is small in our ( non - rotating black hole ) models .",
    "we calculated the integrated spectrum of the @xmath205 , @xmath140 disk for three disk inclination angles .",
    "for each inclination , the disk is divided into several annuli (  [ subsubsec : face on disk ] ) and each annulus subdivided into several sectors .",
    "the radiative transfer equation is solved for the spectral intensity at the appropriate rest - frame inclination angle using the exact source function and the results are summed over all annuli and sectors . as before , doppler boosting , relativistic aberration and the gravitational redshift are included , but we neglect the general relativistic bending of the light rays by the central black hole .    at low frequencies ,",
    "the emergent intensity is limb - darkened ( fig .",
    "[ fig : limb disk ] ) . due to the low opacity below the lyman edge",
    ", the photosphere for these frequencies tends to lie relatively deep inside the atmosphere , where the temperature gradient is small or positive ( i.e. temperature decreases upward ) .",
    "consequently , the angular dependence is determined largely by the usual limb - darkening influence of scattering . however , at frequencies well above the lyman edge , the intensity is more nearly isotropic .",
    "several effects combine to explain this change .",
    "because of the greater opacity , the photosphere in this range lies higher in the atmosphere , where the temperature tends to increase outward .",
    "therefore , photons traveling well away from the axis can only depart from relatively high altitude , where the temperature is comparatively high .",
    "in addition , because these frequencies are radiated almost exclusively by the innermost rings of the disk , relativistic boosting and beaming are especially important .",
    "the decreasing degree of limb - darkening with increasing frequency causes the feature at the lyman edge to strengthen with disk inclination .",
    "we expect the relative limb - brightening of the ionizing continuum to increase with central mass and , if @xmath206 is approximately constant , disk luminosity .",
    "this is because temperature gradients increase with @xmath3 (  [ subsubsec : face on disk ] ) .",
    "doppler broadening of the lyman edge increases with disk inclination .",
    "the typical line of sight to an edge - on disk is nearly parallel to the disk rotation velocity so the doppler boost is maximized .",
    "the lyman edge is formed at @xmath207 , where @xmath208 , so the edge is spread over a range @xmath209 ( fig . [",
    "fig : limb disk ] ) .",
    "the peak of the emergent flux shifts upward by the same amount .",
    "an edge - on disk will not appear to have an emission feature at the lyman edge , but the continuum slope becomes harder going from frequencies below the lyman edge to higher frequencies .",
    "this result is consistent with the conclusions of laor ( 1992 ) .",
    "the reprocessed uv radiation is inverse compton scattered by the relativistic electrons in the coronae .",
    "we calculate the comptonized uv spectrum for scattering by a relativistic maxwell - boltzmann distribution of electrons @xmath210 where @xmath211 , the coronal temperature is @xmath212 and @xmath213 is the second order modified bessel function .",

    "the small corrections due to anisotropy of the incident uv radiation field were neglected ( haardt 1993 ) .",
    "higher order scatterings determine the shape of the high energy spectrum ( pozdnyakov , sobol & sunyaev 1976 ) so we plot the results over a limited range of frequencies near the lyman edge ( figs .",

    "the spectrum of the comptonized uv flux is determined primarily by the thomson depth of the corona , @xmath8 .",

    "comptonization in an optically thick corona ( @xmath7 ) smooths the spectrum at all frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : compton tau ] ) , preferentially scattering photons from low to high energy . as a consequence ,",
    "the spectrum of the non - ionizing flux becomes steeper and the ionizing continuum hardens to an approximate power - law .",
    "because the width of the lyman edge is dominated by relativistic boosting , inverse compton scattering in an optically thick corona may reduce its amplitude but does not significantly broaden it ( fig .",
    "[ fig : compton tau ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of the emission feature reaches a minimum when @xmath216 .",
    "the actual value of @xmath217 depends upon the parameters of the corona and the input uv spectrum but the range of values is easily understood .",
    "each input photon has a probability @xmath218 of being scattered in the corona and the scattered photons are redistributed over a frequency range @xmath219 .",
    "thus , very little redistribution occurs when @xmath220 and the scattered photons emerge at much higher energies when @xmath221 .",

    "stern , ( 1995 ) prefer a model in which the corona is clumped , but close to the accretion disk , and has @xmath231 .",
    "if the corona is highly clumped , it can have little effect on the bulk of the uv photons .",
    "these modeling efforts indicate that a smooth corona must be rather optically thin , so it seems unlikely that the mean total compton depth overlying the rings producing the lyman edge can be any greater than a few tenths in most cases .",

    "however , both the fraction of the total gravitational energy dissipated in the disk and @xmath0 must be very finely tuned to eliminate lyman edge features from all agn .",
    "inverse compton scattering in the disk coronae can smooth out the lyman edge feature only if the hot corona producing the hard x - rays covers most of the disk and has an optical depth @xmath7 . because most recent treatments of x - ray production suggest that either the optical depth is rather smaller than this , or else the hot corona is highly clumped , it is unlikely that compton scattering smooths the lyman edge .    the only escape we see from this contradiction makes use of the fact that the evidence for x - ray irradiation comes almost entirely from low luminosity agn ( seyfert galaxies ) , while spectra of the lyman edge region exist only for high luminosity agn ( quasars ) .",
    "the reason for this separation is that only the seyfert galaxies , which are relatively nearby , are bright enough for detailed x - ray spectroscopy , while in order for us to see the lyman edge , we must look at objects with redshifts great enough to bring it below the lyman cut - off imposed by our galaxy s interstellar medium .",
    "perhaps , then , seyfert galaxies have lyman edges in emission ( if we could only see them ) , while quasar disks are not so thoroughly irradiated by x - rays .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy of quasars by future , more sensitive instruments , will be able to test this idea .    thus , our calculation of the uv spectrum expected from irradiated disks raises serious questions for accretion disk models .",
    "while the x - ray production and x - ray reflection models which motivated this study have had substantial success in describing agn x - ray spectra , we now see that they also predict strong lyman edge emission features , a prediction that is contradicted by the simplest interpretation of the observations .",
