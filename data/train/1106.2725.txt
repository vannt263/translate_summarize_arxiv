    "a deeper understanding of the globular cluster population in the galactic bulge is becoming possible , thanks to high resolution spectroscopy and deep photometry , using 8 - 10 m telescopes .",
    "an interesting class concerns moderately metal - poor globular clusters ( [ fe / h]@xmath0 - 1.0 ) , showing a blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) . a dozen of these objects are found projected on the bulge @xcite , and they might represent the oldest globular clusters formed in the galaxy .    according to @xcite , the first generation of massive , fast - evolving stars , formed at redshifts as high as z@xmath035 .",
    "second generation low mass stars would be found primarily in the inner parts of the galaxy today , as well as inside satellite galaxies .",
    "@xcite suggest that the metal - poor component of the galactic bulge should have formed through a subgalactic clump merger process in the proto - galaxy , where star formation would be induced and chemical enrichment by supernovae type ii occurred .",
    "the metal - rich component instead would have formed gradually in the inner disk .",
    "therefore , metal - poor inner bulge globular clusters might be relics of an early generation of long - lived stars formed in the proto - galaxy .",
    "another aspect of the interest of inner bulge studies , comes from evidences that stellar populations in the galactic bulge are similar to those in spiral bulges and elliptical galaxies , and therefore they are of great interest as templates for the study of external galaxies @xcite . in the past ,",
    "the detailed study of the bulge globular clusters was hampered by high reddening and crowding . with the improvement of instrumentation",
    ", it is now possible to derive accurate proper motions , and to apply membership cleaning .",
    "most previous efforts in the direction of proper motion studies were carried out using hubble space telescope - hst data by our group ( e.g. @xcite ) for ngc 6553 , or @xcite for ngc 6528 , and @xcite for field stars , among others .    in a systematic study of bulge globular clusters ( e.g. @xcite",
    ", we identified a sample of moderately metal - poor clusters ( [ fe / h]@xmath1 - 1.0 ) concentrated close to the galactic center .",
    "hp  1 has a relatively low reddening , and appeared to us as a suitable target to be explored in detail in terms of proper motions .",
    "its coordinates are @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( j2000 ) , and projected at only 3.33@xmath4 from the galactic center ( l=-2@xmath5 , b=@xmath6 ) .    in 2008 , the european southern observatory ( eso ) announced a public call for science verification of the multi - conjugate adaptive optics demonstrator ( mad , @xcite ) , installed at the eso ut3-melipal telescope .",
    "several star clusters were observed with the mad facility , delivering high quality data for the open clusters trapezium , fsr  1415 and trumpler  15 , the globular clusters terzan  5 and ngc  3201 @xcite , and 30  doradus @xcite .",
    "the major advantage of mad is that it allows correcting for atmospheric turbulence over a wide @xmath7 diameter field of view , and as such , constitutes a pathfinder experiment for future facilities at the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) .",
    "wide field adaptive optics with large telescopes opens a new frontier in determining accurate parameters for most globular clusters , that remain essentially unstudied because of high reddening , crowding ( cluster and/or field ) , and large distances .    in sect .",
    "2 the observations and data reductions are described . in sect .",
    "3 the hp  1 proper motions are derived .",
    "the impact of the high quality proper motion cleaned color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) on cluster properties are examined in sect .",
    "the cluster orbit in the galaxy is reconstructed in sect .",
    "5 . finally , conclusions are given in sect .",
    "mad was developed by the eso adaptive optics department to be used as a visitor instrument at vlt - melipal in view of an application to the e - elt .",
    "it was installed at the visitor nasmyth focus and the concept of multiple reference stars for layer oriented adaptive optics corrections was introduced .",
    "this allows a much wider and more uniform corrected field of view , providing larger average strehl ratios and making the system a powerful diffraction limit imager .",
    "this is particularly important in crowded fields where photometric accuracy is needed .",
    "following our successful use of mad in the first science demonstration ( momany et al .",
    "2008 ) , we were granted time to observe hp  1 in the second science demonstration ( ) .",
    "hp  1 was observed on august @xmath8 , 2008 .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] displays the log of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( for brevity we use @xmath11 ) observations .",
    "clearly , the seeing in @xmath11 was excellent being almost half that in @xmath9 ( @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 ) .",
    "the mad infrared scientific imaging camera is based on a @xmath15 pixel hawaii-2 infrared detector with a pixel scale of @xmath16 . in total , @xmath17 min . of scientific exposures were dedicated to each filter , and subdivided into @xmath18 dithered images .",
    "the images were dark and sky - subtracted and then flat - fielded following the standard near infrared recipes ( e.g. momany et al .",
    "2003 ) , within iraf environment .",
    "the typical dithering pattern of a mad observation allows a field of view of @xmath19 in diameter . within this field of view ,",
    "three reference bright stars ( @xmath20 magnitudes that ranged between @xmath21 and @xmath22 according to their ucac2 magnitude system ) were selected to ensure the optics correction .",
    "however , one of these proved to be a blend of two stars , which did not allow a full optical correction of the field .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] shows the mosaic of all 10 @xmath9 and @xmath11 images as constructed by the daophot / montage2 task .",
    "the superb vlt / mad resolution is illustrated when compared to that seen in the 2mass @xmath11 image of hp  1 .",
    "for the proper motion purposes , the mad data set represents our second epoch data .",
    "the displacement of the hp  1 stellar content was derived by comparing the position of the stars in this data set with respect to that of susi@ntt obtained on may @xmath23 , 1994 @xcite .",
    "the epoch separation is @xmath24 years .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the seeing of 0.45  for the v image of hp  1 is one of the best obtained at the ntt @xcite .",
    "the photometric reductions of the two data sets ( ntt and mad ) were carried out separately .",
    "we found about 3100 stars in common between the mad and ntt data , which were used for the proper motion analyses .",
    "the stellar photometry and astrometry were obtained by point spread function ( psf ) fitting using daophot  ii / allframe @xcite .",
    "once the find and phot tasks were performed and the stellar - like sources were detected , we searched for isolated stars to build the psf , for each single image .",
    "the final psf was generated with a penny function that had a quadratic dependence on frame position .",
    "allframe combines psf photometry carried out on the individual images and allows the creation of a master list by combining images from different filters .",
    "thereby this pushes the detection limit to fainter magnitudes and provides a better determination of the stellar magnitudes ( given that 5 measurements were used for each detected star ) .",
    "our observing strategy employed the same exposure time for all images , and no bright red giant stars were saturated . when producing the photometric catalog in one filter ( and since only the central part of the field of view had multiple measurements of any star ) , stars appearing in any single image were considered to be real .",
    "later , when producing the final @xmath25 color catalog , only those appearing in both filters were recorded ( this way we removed essentially all detections due to cosmic rays and other spurious detections ) .",
    "the photometric catalog was finally transformed into coordinates with astrometric precision by using 12 ucac2 reference stars with @xmath26 .",
    "photometric calibration of the @xmath9 and @xmath11 data has been made possible by direct comparison of the brightest mad non - saturated ( @xmath27 ) stars with their 2mass counterpart photometry .    from these stars we estimate a mean offset of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "photometric errors and completeness were estimated from artificial star experiments previously applied to similar mad data ( momany et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the images with added artificial stars were re - processed in the same manner as the original images .",
    "the results for photometric completeness showed that we reach a photometric completeness of @xmath30 and @xmath31 around @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the proper motion of the hp  1 stellar content was derived by estimating the displacement in the ( @xmath34 ) instrumental coordinates between mad ( second epoch data ) and the ntt ( first epoch ) data . since",
    "this measurement was made with respect to reference stars that are cluster members , the motion zero point is the centroid motion of the cluster .",
    "the small mad field of view is fully sampled by the wider ntt coverage , and thus essentially all mad entries had ntt counterparts for proper motion determination . in this regard",
    ", we note that the photometric completeness of the mad data set is less than that of the optical @xmath35 ntt data , that reached at least 2 magnitudes below the cluster turnoff @xcite .",
    "the daophot / daomaster task was used to match the photometric mad and ntt catalogs , using their respective ( @xmath34 ) instrumental coordinates .",
    "this task employed a cubic transformation function , which , with a matching radius of @xmath36 pixels or @xmath37 , easily identified reference stars among the cluster s stars ( having similar proper motions ) .",
    "as a consequence , the stars that matched between the 2 catalogs were basically only hp  1 stars . in a separate procedure , the j2000 mad and ntt catalogs transformed into astrometric coordinates ,",
    "were applied to a matching procedure , using the iraf / tmatch task .",
    "this first / second epoch merged file included also the ( @xmath34 ) instrumental coordinates of each catalog .",
    "thus , applying the cubic transformation to both coordinate systems yielded the displacement with respect to the centroid motion of hp  1 .",
    "an extraction within a @xmath38 pixel radius around ( @xmath39 ) in pixel displacement showed to contain most , and essentially only hp  1 stars , and we will use this selection for the rest of the paper .    on the other hand , stars outside this radius ( i.e. representing the bulge populations ) are more dispersed , and required a careful analysis . in a first attempt we used only the stars with @xmath40y @xmath41 -1 ( in order to avoid cluster stars ) to get the baricentric position of the field bulge population in x , and stars with @xmath40 x @xmath42 1 to measure the field bulge population in y. after a number of tests with different selections , in a second attempt we made a two gaussian component fit along a 0.2 pixels wide strip connecting the center of the cluster distribution and the field distribution . for the present analysis we adopted for the proper motion of the cluster , relatively to the field , the mean of the two determinations ( @xmath40 x , @xmath40 y ) = ( -2.1 , 1.96 ) . from the gaussian fit we derived the width of the distributions of the cluster and field stars , resulting respectively @xmath43=0.583 and 2.565 pixels , corresponding to 15 and 41 mas respectively .",
    "this is the error of the single star position .",
    "the statistical error of the mean is obtained by dividing the single star error by the square - root of the number of stars used ( about 1700 in the cluster and 1500 in the bulge ) for each of the two measurements .",
    "the error on the mean position of the field obviously dominates and corresponds to about 0.05 pixels , or 1.3 mas ( about 0.1 mas / year ) .",
    "this is indeed a very small error .",
    "we performed a number of tests fitting the cluster stars and the field stars in different conditions checking for additional uncertainties .",
    "a further quantitative evaluation of the fitting uncertainty can be obtained measuring the different distances between the centers of the hp1 proper motions cloud to that of the field , propagated from the error on the angle of the line connecting the two groups of stars .",
    "the angle of the vector joining the center of the hp1 proper motion cloud to that of each star of the bulge was computed , and a gaussian fit was performed which returned a 1-sigma dispersion of 14@xmath4 .",
    "this uncertainty propagates on the distances of the two groups by about 0.39 mas / year , dominating over the other discussed sources .",
    "the astrometric errors are the combination of different random and systematic errors @xcite .",
    "they concluded that in the case of relative ground - based astrometry in a small rich field , the main error sources are random centering errors due to noise and blends , and random - systematic errors due to field distorsions , and finally by systematic errors due to chromatic effects .    _",
    "i ) centering errors : _ considering that we used two very different data sets , a first epoch based on direct ccd photometry , and a second one , on the corrected infrared adaptive optics ( with a much wider scale and better resolution ) , we can assume that the astrometric random errors are dominated by the first epoch classical ccd photometry .",
    "following @xcite , we performed a test with 3 consecutive ntt images of baade s window taken in the same night .",
    "they were obtained with equal ( 4 min . )",
    "exposure times , and nearly at the same pixel positions .",
    "the seeing was stable and these images were obtained about 1 hour later than the 10 min .",
    "cluster v exposure .",
    "this baade s window field was chosen because the stars are uniformly distributed across the image , and the density of stars is similar to the hp  1 field .",
    "these images were analysed in @xcite .",
    "the position of the stars in common were compared . the photometric and astrometric errors are shown in figs .",
    "the astrometric centering error , averaged over the whole dynamic range , is 0.1 pixels , as indicated in fig .",
    "this corresponds to 13 mas , which is comparable with the 7 mas pointing error by @xcite .",
    "the value of 13 mas amounts to 0.91 mas / yr in an interval of 14.25 yr .",
    "taking into account the number of about 3000 stars ( half field and half cluster ) used for the proper motion derivation of hp  1 , this leads to a minor error of 0.022 mas .    _",
    "ii ) field distortion errors : _ the field distortion analysis is usually performed employing shifted images of a field with uniformly distributed stars .",
    "hp  1 multiple shifted images are not available in our first epoch run .",
    "to estimate the distortions , we compared the proper motion of cluster stars in hp  1 ntt images as a function of the distance from the optical center .",
    "the distribution did not show any relevant trend , and the statistical analysis indicates that there is no significant shift above 0.01 pixel across the field .",
    "this corresponds to 0.19 mas / yr .    _",
    "iii ) chromatic errors : _ chromatic errors are due to the different refraction , both atmospheric and instrumental , on stars with different colors .",
    "the refraction dependence on wavelength ( inverse quadratic to first approximation ) makes this effect more pronounced in v , i than in the near infrared .",
    "ideally , a chromatic experiment should include a measurement of the displacement of stars with different colors , at different airmasses .",
    "however , we do not have specific observations for this test .",
    "thus , we followed the procedure given by @xcite where they measured the displacement of stars as a function of their colors .",
    "we took the resulting pixel displacement of the cluster stars , and separately checked the shift variations with the color ( v - i ) .",
    "such plot does not show an evident dependence on color .",
    "this is expected since our ntt observations were taken very close to the zenith ( airmass@xmath11.04 ) , and the infrared mad data have a negligible effect .    in order to further quantify any chromatic systematic effect , we subdivided the sample of cluster stars into a redder ( v - i @xmath42 2.2 ) and a bluer ( v - i @xmath41 2.2 ) groups , of 106 and 171 stars respectively .",
    "the displacement between the two groups resulted to be 0.031@xmath440.03 pixels , corresponding to 0.9 mas . in 14.25 yr ,",
    "this gives 0.06 mas / yr .    _ iv ) total errors : _    by quadratically adding the errors on centering , distortion and chromatic effects of respectively 0.022 mas / yr , 0.19 mas / yr , and 0.06 mas / yr , a total contribution of these errors of 0.2 mas / yr is obtained .",
    "the estimated error of 0.39 mas / yr in the proper motion value indicates that the effect due to the mutual field and cluster stars contamination dominates over the astrometric pointing , distortion and chromatic errors .",
    "figure  [ f3 ] presents the mad @xmath11 @xmath45 @xmath46 cmds showing the proper motion decontamination process in three panels : for the whole field , cluster proper motion decontaminated , and remaining field only . in the top panels",
    "are shown the displacements of stars between the ntt and mad images , plotted in the mad pixel scale .",
    "the decontaminated cluster cmd provides fundamental parameters to study its properties , in particular metallicity and age .",
    "figure  [ f4 ] shows a @xmath9 @xmath45 @xmath47 proper motion decontaminated cmd of hp  1 .",
    "a distance modulus of ( m - m)@xmath48 = 15.3 and a reddening of e(v - k ) = 3.3 were applied , and a padova isochrone @xcite with metallicity @xmath49 and age of @xmath50 gyr is overplotted .",
    "the fit confirms the cluster metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath51 , found from high resolution spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "we note that the turnoff is not as well matched as the giant branch , due to two well - known main reasons : the bluer turnoff in isochrones relative to observations is possibly connected with color transformations , and on the other hand , systematic bias in the photometric errors give brighter magnitudes close to the limit of the photometry .",
    "similarly , fig .",
    "[ f5 ] displays the @xmath11 @xmath45 @xmath47 hp  1 diagram as compared with the ngc  6752 ( [ fe / h]@xmath52 ) mean locus @xcite .",
    "the red giant branches of m  30 , m  107 , 47 tuc and ngc  6441 of metallicities [ fe / h]@xmath53 , and @xmath54 , respectively , are also overplotted , where the metallicity values , mean loci and the red giant fiducials are from @xcite .",
    "the hp  1 bright red giants clearly overlap the m  107 fiducial ( reflecting their similar metallicity ) and are redder with respect to the ngc  6752 bright giants . on the other hand , the cluster old age is reflected by the presence of a well defined and extended bhb ( very similar to ngc  6752 ) .",
    "five rr  lyrae candidates appear in the rr lyrae gap , at @xmath55 .",
    "@xcite reported 15 variable stars in hp  1 , but none has been identified as rr lyrae .",
    "the horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology is sensitive mainly to metallicity and age .",
    "the age effect is related to the so - called second parameter effect @xcite , as well demonstrated in models by @xcite , @xcite and in observations by @xcite . in particular , @xcite analysed the hb morphology from acs / hst observations , based on the difference between the average hb @xmath56 color and the subgiant branch ( sgb ) color @xmath57 , and concluded that age dominates the second parameter .",
    "this indicator is very sensitive to the cluster age , and more so around the metallicity @xmath49 .",
    "for hp  1 the mean @xmath56 color difference between the sgb and the hb is @xmath58 . a comparison with @xcites sample shows that hp  1 has a very blue hb for its metallicity .",
    "we selected 5 clusters with the same hb morphological index , and found an average metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath59 , and another group of 5 clusters , with a comparable metallicity to hp  1 .",
    "this second group has an average @xmath60 which is considerably smaller than in hp  1 , consistent with hp  1 having a much bluer hb .",
    "both cluster groups have a mean age of @xmath61 gyr . from fig .",
    "17 of dotter et al . , we get an age difference of about 1 gyr older for hp  1 relative to their sample of halo clusters with @xmath112.7 gyr , resulting for hp  1 an age of @xmath62 gyr",
    ". therefore hp  1 appears to be among the oldest globular clusters in the galaxy .    for the distance determination , there are basically two methods : a ) the relative distance between the cluster and bulk of the bulge field , and b ) based on the absolute distance , which requires reddening values . for the first of these methods , we rely on the difference between the hp  1 horizontal branch at the rr lyrae level , at @xmath63 , and that of the bulge field at @xmath64 . thus the cluster is @xmath65 brighter than the field , and taking into account metallicity effects on the hb luminosity ( @xcite , we obtain @xmath66 .",
    "this implies that the cluster is 1.2@xmath440.4 kpc in the foreground of the bulge bulk population .",
    "the uncertainty is due to the metallicity difference of about 1 dex between the bulge ( [ fe / h]@xmath00.0 ) and hp  1 ( [ fe / h]@xmath0 - 1.0 ) . assuming the distance of the galactic center to be r@xmath67=8.0@xmath440.6 @xcite , a distance of d@xmath68 kpc",
    "is obtained .",
    "if the orbits of stars near the super massive black hole near the galactic center method is used , a distance of r@xmath67=8.33@xmath440.35 kpc is given by @xcite .",
    "in this case the distance of hp  1 to the sun is d@xmath69 kpc .",
    "this relative distance method is reddening independent , because the reddening of cluster and surrounding field is expected to be the essentially the same , due to a negligible reddening inside the bulge ( barbuy et al .",
    "therefore the distance of the cluster to the galactic center depends only on the assumed distance of the galactic center .",
    "the second method of absolute distances requires reddening determinations . from the optical and infrared cmds , and adopting the absolute - to - selective absorption r@xmath70 @xcite , we obtain a mean distance from the sun of d@xmath71 kpc . within the uncertainties for the cluster and galactic center distances , we conclude that hp  1 is probably the globular cluster located closest to the galactic center .    for simplicity",
    "we assume the distance of hp  1 from the sun to be d@xmath68 kpc hereafter .",
    "to compute the velocity components of hp  1 s motion we need its radial velocity and the proper motion .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocity * v@xmath72  km  s@xmath73 * was adopted from the high resolution analysis by @xcite .",
    "the proper motion can be computed with respect to the bulge , and the bulge proper motion can then be subtracted .",
    "the bulge proper motion is a composition of the bulge internal kinematics , and the reflected motion of the lsr . near the position of hp  1 , the bulge kinematics is close to that of a rotating solid body with spin axis orthogonal to the galactic plane ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note also that this correction is not large : hp  1 is projected so close to the galactic center that the rotational velocity of the bulge is closely aligned with the line of sight , so its tangential component is very small . because both motions are parallel to the galactic plane , it is convenient to work in galactic coordinates .    as fig .",
    "[ f6 ] shows , the hp1 motion with respect to the bulge has a vector @xmath74 we were working with @xmath75 coordinates , while here we put the two epochs in chronological order , thus @xmath76 coordinates are used .",
    "the signs are therefore inverted . taking into account the scale of @xmath77 and that @xmath78 , the vector expressed in equatorial coordinates is @xmath79 .",
    "the position angle of the @xmath80 axis with respect to the dec axis is @xmath81 , which can be used to rotate @xmath82 obtaining @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the coordinate transformations were performed with the code sm @xcite , in particular using the package _ project _ , _ _ written by m. strauss and r. lupton . with an epoch difference",
    "@xmath86  yr , these displacements yield proper motion components relative to the bulge @xmath875  mas  yr@xmath73 and @xmath88  mas  yr@xmath73 . as recalled above , to obtain absolute proper motions we subtract the reflected motion of the lsr , and the bulge internal motion .",
    "assuming @xmath89  , at a distance of @xmath90  kpc from the galactic center ( these values are explained below ) we obtain @xmath91  mas  yr@xmath73 . ]    to estimate the bulge internal motion , we note that @xcite obtained a rotational velocity of @xmath92 , in their fields 6/05 and 6/18 ( b=-6@xmath4 and field number ) , at positions @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively . in the solid body approximation , @xmath95 depends linearly on the radius @xmath96 ( confirmed by @xcite ) , and at the position of hp1 ( sect .",
    "1 ) we expect @xmath97  km  sec@xmath73",
    "( where we assumed @xmath98 for small values of @xmath99 )",

    "[ orbit ] ) .",
    "assuming that bulge stars are at the distance of the galactic center , the tangential component of @xmath95 is @xmath105  km  s@xmath73 directed toward increasing @xmath99 . after adding @xmath106 to @xmath107 , the composite motion of the bulge becomes @xmath108 , and subtracting it from the relative motion quoted above yields for hp  1 @xmath109 and @xmath110 . using this proper motion , in the next section we calculate the cluster orbit .",
    "the orbit was computed both with the axisymmetric model by @xcite and with a model including a bar .",
    "the models and integration algorithm are described in jilkova et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "similar models have also been used in @xcite .",
    "compared to these earlier versions , the axisymmetric model was rescaled to match the more recent values of rotation velocity , solar galactocentric distance and solar velocity relative to the lsr .",
    "@xcite estimated a rotation velocity of @xmath111 , and a distance of @xmath112kpc , using the solar motion relative to the lsr determined by @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis of dehnen et al .",
    "was recently re - examined by @xcite obtaining slightly different values ",
    "the component in the direction of solar galactic rotation is @xmath113 higher . taking this into account , we rescaled the @xcite parameters to get values of @xmath114 at @xmath90kpc , which is also consistent with the results of @xcite who obtained the solar rotation velocity from the proper motion of sgra*.    the galactic bar is modeled by a ferrers potential of an inhomogeneous triaxial ellipsoid @xcite .",
    "the model parameters are adopted from @xcite with length of 3.14kpc , axis ratio 10:3.75:2.56 , mass of @xmath115  m@xmath116 , angular velocity of @xmath104 , and an initial angle with respect to the direction to the sun of @xmath117 ( in the direction of galactic rotation ) .",
    "for the axisymmetric background we keep the potential described above with decreased bulge mass by the mass of the bar .",
    "the initial conditions for the orbit calculations are obtained from the observational data characterizing the cluster : coordinates , distance to the sun , radial velocity , and proper motion . to evaluate the impact of the measurement errors , we calculate a set of @xmath118 orbits with initial conditions given by sampling the distributions of observational inputs .",
    "we assume normal distributions for the distance to the sun , radial velocity , and proper motion .",
    "the errors on radial velocity and proper motion components are given above , while for the distance to the sun we assumed an error of @xmath31 .",
    "the transformation of the observational data to the cartesian coordinate system centered on the sun was carried out with the @xcite algorithm . the velocity vector with respect to the lsr",
    "is then obtained by correction for the solar motion with respect to the lsr from @xcite : @xmath119 ( right - handed system , with @xmath120 in the direction to the galactic center and @xmath121 in the galactic rotation direction ) .",
    "the final transformation to the galactocentric coordinate system was made by using the solar galactocentric distance 8.4  kpc and the lsr rotation velocity of @xmath122 ( see above ) .",

    "the example of orbits given by the average values of the observational data is given in fig .",
    "the presence of the bar disturbs the orbit of this central globular cluster , causing deviations not found in the axisymmetric model .",
    "this can be considered as an upper limit for the excursions that the cluster can make inward and outward .",
    "even so , it is clear that the cluster is essentially confined within the bulge .",
    "running simulations for a longer time is not very meaningful because there is evidence that the bar structure is a transient feature .",
    "for example @xcite suggest that the current bar might have formed only @xmath130  gyr ago .",
    "it is then impossible to simulate the orbit along the entire life of the milky way , but one can guess that older bars would have had a similar effect on the orbit of hp1 . note that we also included the spiral arms , but they do not change the orbit significantly .",
    "they are very weak and the orbit is too close to the galactic center to be influenced by any radial migration due to bar and spiral arm interaction .",
    "we calculated orbital parameters as averaged values over individual revolutions in the galactic plane for each orbit .",
    "distributions for apogalacticon @xmath131 , vertical height of orbit @xmath132 , and phase period @xmath133 are shown in fig .",
    "in general the orbits do not reach galactic distances larger than 5kpc and also the cluster remains close to the galactic plane ( @xmath134kpc for the axisymmetric model , @xmath135kpc for the model including bar ) .    for comparison purposes",
    ", we also computed the hp  1 orbit using the code developed by @xcite , that includes the galactic spheroidal and the disk potentials .",
    "it was recently applied to @xmath136 centauri orbital simulations @xcite . in this method",
    "we use essentially the same initial conditions ( u@xmath137,v@xmath137,w@xmath137 ) , as in the previous method above , and the simulation results agreed well with the previous method for the barless model .",
    "the clear definition of an extended blue horizontal branch morphology obtained from these high spatial resolution data , as provided by the proper motion cleaning method , indicates a very old age for hp  1 , of @xmath11 gyr older than the halo average .",
    "the proper motions and orbits derived indicate that hp  1 does not wade into the halo and is confined within the galactic bulge . as a consequence ,",
    "hp  1 can be identified as a representative relics of an early generation of star clusters formed in the proto - galaxy .",
    "the very old globular cluster ngc  6522 , also having moderate metallicity and bhb , is as well confined within the bulge @xcite . as compared with the template metal - rich bulge globular cluster ngc  6553 @xcite , hp  1 appears to have a more excentric orbit , and it is much closer to the galactic center .    extensive tests of orbits within potential wells that includes a massive bar show that the confinement of hp  1 within the bulge is maintained , even in case of random orbits generated by the presence of the bar .",
    "the case of hp  1 with wide field multi - conjugate adaptive optics shows that such ground - based facilities can be used for high spatial resolution studies of crowded inner bulge clusters .",
    "such data can provide a great impact for a better understanding of the globular cluster subsystems , and their connection with stellar populations in the galaxy , and the sequence of processes involved in the formation of the galaxy itself .",
    "we are grateful to ata sarajedini for helpful discussions on the second parameter effect .",
    "we thank the referee for important suggestions on the proper motion analysis .",
    "we thank the eso adaptive optics group , in particular , enrico marchetti and paola amico .",
    "bb and eb acknowledge grants from the brazilian agencies cnpq and fapesp .",

    "with origin in hp1 the bulge has coordinates @xmath139 .",
    "therefore the hp1 motion with respect to the bulge has a vector @xmath140 ( red arrow ) . because ra and @xmath141 have opposite directions , the vector expressed in equatorial coordinates is @xmath142 .",
    "the relative orientation of the equatorial and galactic coordinate systems is shown in the upper right corner , making clear that the proper motion of hp1 is mostly along positive @xmath99 , with a small component along negative @xmath80 .",
    "the orbit must then be confined near the galactic plane .",
