    "hot , massive stars are not expected , a priori , to exhibit magnetic fields as they lack the convective envelopes necessary for driving a dynamo . however , ap / bp stars ( chemically peculiar a and b type stars ) are well known to possess organized magnetic fields with surface strengths up to tens of kg ( e.g. borra & landstreet 1979 ) .",
    "the hottest of the bp stars are the so - called helium - strong stars - early b - type stars on the main sequence with enhanced and typically variable helium lines .",
    "some helium - strong stars show additional emission and variability in balmer lines , variable photometric brightness and color , variable uv resonance lines , and non - thermal radio emission ( pedersen & thomsen 1977 ; walborn 1982 ; shore & brown 1990 ; leone & umana 1993 ) .",
    "all of these quantities vary with a single period , interpreted to be the rotational period of the star .",
    "the balmer line ( specifically h@xmath7 ) and uv line variability point to the presence of a stellar wind coupled with a magnetic field to form a circumstellar magnetosphere ( shore & brown 1990 ) .",
    "following their discovery of a magnetic field in the b2vp star @xmath8 ori e ( landstreet & borra 1978 ) , borra & landstreet ( 1979 ) investigated eight helium - strong stars , finding six new magnetic stars . in that paper , the authors established that a defining characteristic of the helium - strong stars is the presence of an strong , organized magnetic field .",
    "hr  7355 ( hd  182180 ) , the subject of the present paper , is a bright ( v=6.02 ) helium - strong early b - type star with high @xmath0 ( 320 km  s@xmath2 , abt et al 2002 ; 270 km  s@xmath2 , glebocki & stawikowski 2000 ) .",
    "originally classified as b5iv by morris ( 1961 ) , hiltner et al .",
    "( 1969 ) re - classified hr  7355 b2vn , a classification that has been used subsequently .",
    "hr  7355 has also been classified as a classical be star ( abt & cardona 1984 ) due to observed emission in the h@xmath7 line of its spectrum .",
    "hipparcos photometry exhibits variability with a period of @xmath9 0.26 days ( koen & eyer 2002 ) .",
    "rivinius et al .",
    "( 2008 ) reported emission and variability of the h@xmath7 profiles , as well as variability of a variety of spectral absorption lines ( i.e. he , c , si ) .",
    "those authors revisited the hipparcos photometry noting that a period of 0.52 days ( twice the period reported by koen & eyer ( 2002 ) ) could also explain the photometric variation . ultimately , based on the helium variability , the variable h@xmath7 emission , and the character of the photometric variation , rivinius et al .",
    "( 2008 ) proposed that hr  7355 hosts a structured magnetosphere qualitatively similar to that of @xmath8 ori e. with its very rapid rotation , the establishment of such a magnetosphere around hr  7355 would be of great interest .",
    "we have therefore undertaken observations to search for the presence of a magnetic field in this star , and to further explore its spectroscopic and other physical properties .",
    "we obtained 8 high resolution ( r=65000 ) broadband ( 370 - 1040  nm ) spectra from the spectropolarimeter espadons attached to the 3.6-m canada - france - hawaii telescope , as part of the magnetism in massive stars ( mimes ) large program ( wade et al .",
    "the data were obtained over the course of three nights in september 2009 .",
    "the log of observations is reported in table [ magfield ] .",
    "reduction was performed at the observatory with the upena pipeline feeding the libre - esprit reduction package ( donati et al .",
    "1997 ) , which yields the stokes i ( intensity ) and stokes v ( circular polarization ) spectrum , as well as the diagnostic null spectrum ( n ) , which diagnoses any spurious contribution to the polarization measurement . conventionally ,",
    "four consecutive sub - exposures are combined to produce one polarization spectrum . however , as each sub - exposure is 1200 seconds in duration (= 0.014 days ) , the combination of four sub - exposures into a single spectrum would correspond to a significant fraction ( 5 or 10% ) of the rotation period of this star .",
    "we therefore processed the observations , combining only sets of two sub - exposures for a total exposure time of 2400 s. the consequence of this change will decrease the signal to noise ratio ( by a factor of @xmath10 ) of the spectrum , and to lose our ability to diagnose first - order systematic errors in the time domain .",
    "the primary benefit , however , is to reduce the exposure time by half , and to thereby better resolve the rotational variation of the spectrum and magnetic field .",
    "beginning on july 24 , 2008 , we conducted three nights ( 204 data points ) of johnson - cousins v filter photometry of hr  7355 , using the 0.9 m ctio telescope operated by the smarts consortium with a @xmath11 ccd detector .",
    "variable weather plagued the first and fourth nights of observation ; the second night provided no data due to weather .",
    "a neutral density filter was employed to prevent ccd saturation .",
    "the observations were reduced using standard procedures ( flat fielding , zero subtraction , etc . ) in iraf .",
    "aperture photometry was employed to extract differential photometric indices for hr  7355 , which were then calibrated against a nearby comparison star , cd-28  15755 .",

    "effective temperatures ( @xmath12 ) from 15000  k to 22000  k ( steps of 1000 k ) and surface gravities ( log @xmath13 ) from 3.0 to 4.0 ( steps of 0.25 dex ) were considered to model the observed optical and uv spectra .    the spectral type and the high rotational velocity presented by hr  7355 ( @xmath14 = 300 @xmath1 15 km",
    "s@xmath2 ) hindered the use of silicon lines ( e.g. , si  ii 412.8 - 413.1  nm and si  iii 455.3 - 457.5  nm ) to determine @xmath12 .",
    "alternatively , the intensity of the balmer and he  i transitions were found to be good diagnostics ( see for example , dufton et al .",
    "for the determination of @xmath15 , we used mainly h@xmath16 .",
    "our best fit for @xmath12 was 17000  k , and for @xmath15 the best value was 3.75 . after the comparison of several grid models to the observed spectrum , we estimated the errors in @xmath12 and log @xmath13 to be about @xmath172000  k and @xmath18  dex , respectively .",
    "these conservative errors were adopted mainly due to the uncertainties involved in the normalization of our echelle spectra , the observed spectral variability , and the fast rotation presented by this star , which causes a large broadening and blends several features , complicating the analysis .",
    "the physical parameters derived are summarized in table [ params ] .",
    "very good agreement is obtained in both uv and optical regions .",
    "since tlusty directly provides only @xmath12 and log @xmath13 , we have computed the luminosity , radius , and the mass of hr  7355 in the following way .",
    "first , we computed the visual extinction @xmath19 from the apparent ( v = 6.02 ) and ism - corrected visual magnitudes ( v@xmath20 ; gutirrez - moreno & moreno 1968 ) .",
    "thereafter , we inferred the distance from the hipparcos parallax for this object ( @xmath21 ; van leeuwen 2007 ) and computed the absolute visual magnitude ( @xmath22 ) . by using the bolometric correction ( bc ) corresponding to our tlusty model ( lanz & hubeny 2007 )",
    ", we thus determined the bolometric magnitude ( @xmath23 ) and then the luminosity , taking the bolometric magnitude of the sun to be 4.75 ( allen 1976 ) . taking the distance and its associated uncertainty , we find that @xmath24 . from this value and @xmath12 , we computed the radius and from log @xmath25 ( see below ) we derived the mass .",
    "these parameters are in good agreement with typical early b star values ( see e.g. trundle et al .",
    "note that if we use the @xmath26 colors of hr  7355 to derive @xmath12 , we obtain a value of @xmath9 18000  k , in agreement with our model analysis .",
    "regarding log @xmath13 , the inferred value of 3.75 should be considered as effective , i.e. , the surface gravity reduced by rotation .",
    "an estimate of the true gravity can be obtained by the following expression ( repolust et al .",
    "2004 ) : @xmath27 for hr  7355 , we find @xmath28 , which is more consistent with its spectral classification .",
    "the stellar mass follows from this value ( see table [ params ] ) .",

    "typical uncertainties are 100 - 150 g. the longitudinal magnetic field is observed to change from about @xmath382 kg to + 2.5 kg .",
    "such a strong longitudinal field suggests an organized magnetic field with a likely surface dipole component stronger than 8  kg .",
    "the rotation period of hr  7355 remains unclear following the analysis of original hipparcos data by koen & eyer ( 2002 ) .",
    "the proposed `` single minimum '' period of approximately 0.26 d would seem , from the rotational velocity , to imply that the star is rotating more rapidly than the critical ( break - up ) rotation rate .",
    "unfortunately , our new photometry from the 0.9 m telescope at ctio does not resolve this ambiguity , as both the shorter period and the longer period ( @xmath9 0.52  d ) produce reasonable light curves .",
    "however , when the longitudinal magnetic field measurements are plotted with both periods , the longitudinal magnetic field can not be phased with the 0.26 day period in a reasonable fashion . however ,",
    "when phased with the 0.52 day period the longitudinal field measurements describe a smooth , approximately sinusoidal variation from @xmath382  kg to + 2.5  kg ( fig .",

    "( 2010 ) and rivinius et al .",
    "therefore , we tentatively select the longer period of * 0.5214404 @xmath1 0.0000006 d * and a photometric light curve consisting of * two separate minima*. we define a new ephemeris for hr  7355 : @xmath44 the jd@xmath43 is determined from one of the minima in the photometric light curve obtained from the new ctio data . both sets of photometry",

    "( 3 ) , the magnetic extrema occur at phases @xmath90.3 and @xmath90.8 .",
    "the sinusoidal variation of the longitudinal magnetic field indicates an important dipole component to the stellar magnetic field . using the characteristics of the sinusoidal fit to the magnetic data and the stellar parameters with their error bars ( derived in  3 )",
    ", we can estimate the geometry and strength of the dipole : the inclination of the rotational axis with respect to the line of sight to the observer , @xmath46 , the obliquity of the dipole axis relative to the rotational axis , @xmath47 , and the polar strength of the surface dipole field , @xmath48 , as described by e.g. wade et al .",
    "we have determined the allowed range of inclinations @xmath49 , assuming rigid rotation .",
    "lower inclinations were not feasible as the implied equatorial rotation velocity ( i.e. @xmath50 ) was higher than the critical break - up velocity ( v@xmath51 ; townsend et al .",
    "2004 ) calculated for the mass and radius considered . using this range of @xmath46 and the observed values of the magnetic extrema ( fig .",
    "[ fullper ] , lower panel ) , we calculate the obliquity to be @xmath52 . with this inclination and obliquity , and the maximum longitudinal field , we compute that the surface dipolar field strength for hr  7355 is 13 - 17 kg at the pole .",
    "the rigidly rotating magnetosphere ( rrm ) model was proposed by townsend & owocki ( 2005 ) to describe a rapidly rotating star in which the magnetic field overpowers the stellar wind , allowing plasma to become trapped in a magnetosphere that co - rotates along with the star .",
    "the geometry of the magnetosphere depends on the obliquity angle and the rotational velocity of the star ( see townsend 2008 ) .",
    "the variability of the observables depends on the inclination angle .",
    "this model was applied to the prototypical helium - strong star , @xmath8 ori e , by townsend et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . comparing our picture of the observations and geometry of hr  7355 with the observations and model of @xmath8 ori e , the two show similarities in both the variability of observables , but also in the relative timing of each observation related to the geometry .",
    "in both stars , the minimum of the photometric light curve corresponds to minimum emission in h@xmath7 , as well as a null in the longitudinal field curve .",
    "although the photometric light curves both show similar v - band magnitude changes ( @xmath90.05 mags ) , the durations of the photometric `` eclipses '' in hr  7355 are slightly longer than those in @xmath8 ori e ; this is not surprising given the more rapid rotation of hr  7355 .",
    "while the phasing of the h@xmath7 variations and the photometric minima of hr  7355 are consistent with circumstellar material , the photometric variations may also be due to photospheric spots on the surface of the star .",
    "based on this small initial dataset , the rrm model appears to be capable of explaining the basic observational phenomena presented by hr  7355 .",
    "we therefore expect it to be useful to confirm and characterize the magnetosphere of hr  7355 once more data are acquired .",
    "hr  7355 is both the most rapidly rotating helium - strong star and the most rapidly rotating magnetic star discovered thus far with a 0.5214404 @xmath1 0.0000006 day period and a @xmath0 of 300 km  s@xmath2 , surpassing the bp star cu vir ( @xmath53 = 0.52070308 d , @xmath0 = 160 km  s@xmath2 , kuschnig et al .",
    "hr  7355 has a strong magnetic field ( @xmath54 13 - 17  kg ) that when coupled with its wind produces metal line variability and a magnetosphere that co - rotates with the star , resulting in variability of h@xmath7 and , photometric brightness .",
    "hr  7355 is rotating near its critical velocity , making it an extreme laboratory to study the effects of a magnetosphere under these conditions , and perhaps even to provide a link between bp and be stars .",
    "however , the high rotation of this star also creates challenges for spectral line analysis . at rotational velocities",
    "near critical , the star becomes oblate and gravity darkening effects become important .",
    "when viewed from the equator , the star can appear reddened and the temperature and surface gravity are lowered ( townsend et al .",
    "2004 ) . detailed line - profile modeling is required to determine accurate parameters .",
    "although historically hr  7355 is classified as b2vn , the temperature derived from its spectrum suggests a later type .",
    "in addition to continuing to monitor the magnetic field , line profile and photometric variations of hr  7355 , we intend to undertake , in a future study , a more physically realistic line profile analysis , taking into account rotational deformation and gravity darkening , to provide a consistent solution for stellar parameters and evolution .",
