    "recent discoveries of jupiter - like planets around other stars have boosted up efforts to understand the origin of giant planets , subject which has been under scrutiny since sixties ( safronov 1969 ; see brush 1990 for a historical perspective ) .",
    "currently one of the most popular and successful theories of giant planet formation is a core ( or nucleated ) instability hypothesis ( harris 1978 ; mizuno 1978 ) . according to this idea massive hydrogen / helium atmospheres of planets like jupiter and saturn",
    "have been acquired as a result of unstable gas accretion onto a preexisting core made of rock and/or ice .",
    "analytical arguments ( stevenson 1982 ; wuchterl 1993 ) and numerical calculations ( mizuno 1980 ; ikoma 2000 ) suggest that the onset of core instability occurs when the mass of the gaseous atmosphere around the core becomes comparable to the core mass itself",
    ".    the following gedankenexperiment can help understand the nature of this instability : imagine placing a massive solid core into an infinite homogeneous gaseous medium .",
    "gravitational pull from the core gives rise to a significant pressure perturbation near the core if the escape speed from its surface is larger than the gas sound speed , see  [ sect : length_scales ] . on a short ( dynamical ) timescale gas",
    "settles into a pressure equilibrium configuration near the core . since the thermal timescale is usually longer than the dynamical timescale , this gaseous envelope initially has entropy equal to that of the gas in the surrounding nebula .",
    "gas temperature at the core surface is rather high and this drives an outward transport of energy causing entropy of the envelope to decrease . as a result , gas density",
    "near the core goes up and envelope becomes more and more massive by slow accumulation ( on a thermal timescale ) of gas from the surrounding nebula .    given enough time , atmosphere around the core that is",
    "not too massive cools down to the nebular temperature and becomes isothermal , acquiring large gaseous mass .",
    "such atmosphere has exponential density profile with most of the mass concentrated near the core surface ( sasaki 1989 ) .",
    "cores are `` not too massive '' when the mass of this isothermal atmosphere is much smaller than the core mass . at the same time , exponential sensitivity to the core gravity ( and mass ) causes atmospheric mass to increase faster than the first power of the core mass . because of that , different fate awaits gas around the core that is more massive : as the atmosphere cools down its mass at some point becomes comparable to the core mass and gas starts contributing significantly to the planetary gravity .",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium can not be established beyond this point , because accretion of more gas , which helps to reestablish pressure equilibrium , also acts now to increase the gravitational acceleration . as a result ,",
    "instability commences allowing gas to accrete rapidly onto the core .",
    "critical core mass at which instability becomes possible is thus set by the condition that the mass of the equilibrium atmosphere around the critical core is comparable to the core mass itself [ apart from additional logarithmic factors intrinsic of the isothermal case , see sasaki ( 1989 ) ] .",
    "note that if the core is very massive , or gas around it is very dense , then even the mass of the isentropic envelope forming around the core on the dynamical time after the core has been introduced into the nebula might exceed the core mass , making atmosphere unstable from the very start .",
    "real protoplanetary cores are not likely to be just passive solid bodies of constant mass .",
    "they accrete planetesimals and accretion not only increases the core mass with time but also leads to the release of substantial amount of energy at the surface of the core .",
    "this changes the steady state structure of the envelope which can no longer be purely isothermal ( as it tends to become in the case of passive core ) . even if we forget for a moment about the increase of the core mass caused by planetesimal accretion , luminosity coming from the core would cause temperature in a steady state atmosphere to be higher near the core surface than in the nebula .",
    "as a result , the gas at the same pressure is less dense around the radiating core than around passive one , meaning that the total atmospheric mass is _ lower _ for luminous core than for passive one .",
    "nevertheless , similar to the isothermal case , the more massive the core is , the more massive is the envelope around it , and scaling between them is faster than linear . as a result , a concept of critical core mass holds again : stable equilibrium atmospheres can not exist around the cores which are so massive that their atmospheric mass exceeds the core mass .",
    "previous numerical and analytical studies confirm this general picture of the core instability , but there are still some open issues .",
    "for example , perri & cameron ( 1974 ) and later wuchterl ( 1993 ) have concluded that protoplanetary atmospheres are likely to be convective and that their interior structure and mass ( which was found to be quite low ) sensitively depend on the density and temperature of the gas in the surrounding nebula .",
    "stevenson ( 1982 ) arrived at a very different conclusion by considering a simple analytical model of an atmosphere with a constant opacity .",
    "he found it to be radiative , massive , and its structure to be insensitive to the external conditions .",
    "his findings confirmed previous numerical results by harris ( 1978 ) , mizuno ( 1978 ) , and mizuno ( 1980 ) .",
    "the purpose of this study is to systematically explore the structure of atmospheres around accreting protoplanetary cores under a variety of conditions typical in the protoplanetary nebulae .",
    "using analytically tractable but still realistic models we attempt to resolve the aforementioned issues concerning the state of the envelope .",
    "we try to single out physical parameters crucial for determining the atmospheric structure and this provides us with a general classification scheme of possible protoplanetary atmospheres .",
    "we are looking for the steady state structures under the explicit assumption that the mass of the gaseous envelope is smaller than the mass of the core which it surrounds .",
    "this restricts our quantitative results to cores with masses below critical mass , although all qualitative conclusions are valid even for critical cores and we use this to estimate the masses of critical cores , see  [ subsect : crit_mass ] .",
    "we start by laying down the basics of the problem at hand  equations , important length and mass scales , boundary conditions  in  [ sect : setup ] . in ",
    "[ sect : solutions ] & [ sect : solutions_inner ] we derive solutions for two important classes of envelope structures typical in the region of giant and terrestrial planets . envelope masses and critical core mass are calculated in  [ subsect : mass ] . our results and their implications are discussed in  [ sect : disc ] .",
    "finally , we devote appendices to technical issues which emerge in our calculations .",
    "throughout this study the following approximation to the protoplanetary disk structure [ similar to the minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) ] is used : @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the particulate and gas surface densities correspondingly , @xmath9 is the gas temperature , and @xmath10 is a distance from the sun @xmath11 scaled by @xmath12 au . from ( [ eq : mmsn ] ) one can find the gas sound speed @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is a boltzmann constant and @xmath15 is a mean molecular weight ) and gas density at the midplane @xmath16 [ @xmath17 is the orbital angular frequency , @xmath18 is the solar mass ] : @xmath19 all numerical estimates in the text refer to this particular model of the protoplanetary disk .",
    "our purpose is to calculate a spherically symmetric distribution of gas density @xmath20 , pressure @xmath21 , and temperature @xmath22 around a solid core with the mass @xmath23 embedded in the nebular gas .",
    "spherical symmetry requires nebula to be at least roughly homogeneous around the core and we determine the conditions for this to be true in the next section .",
    "structure of the static envelope as a function of distance @xmath24 from the center of the core is governed by the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the gravitational constant and @xmath23 is the mass of the core , which we take to be much larger than the mass of the gaseous envelope .",
    "equation ( [ eq : pressure ] ) is not applicable if envelope is rapidly rotating ( when the azimuthal velocity of gas is of the order of the local keplerian velocity around the core ) , thus in the following discussion we assume envelope rotation to be slow .    atmosphere is assumed to be heated from below by a source at the core surface with luminosity @xmath27 .",
    "this energy can be transported by radiative diffusion or convection .",
    "we use the schwarzschild criterion to determine the convective stability of the envelope : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a temperature gradient , @xmath30 is its value under isentropic conditions . as usual , @xmath31 is a adiabatic index of the gas ; for monoatomic gas @xmath32 , for diatomic ( e.g. h@xmath33 ) @xmath34 .",
    "usage of the schwarzschild criterion implies that envelope is chemically homogeneous and nonrotating  a more general ledoux criterion should be used in the presence of the molecular weight gradient ( kippenhahn & weigert 1990 ) , and hiland criterion has to be employed if envelope rotates rapidly ( tassoul 1978 ) .",
    "when atmosphere is convectively stable according to ( [ eq : stab_cond ] ) , energy released at the core surface has to be carried away radiatively . in this case one supplements ( [ eq : pressure ] ) with the equation of radiation transfer . in the diffusion approximation ,",
    "valid in the optically thick case , it reads @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath37 is the opacity . in the outer solar system gas around the protoplanet",
    "can be so rarefied that the outer parts of the envelope are optically thin .",
    "this possibility is considered in more detail in  [ subsect : opt_thin ] .    whenever the stability criterion ( [ eq : stab_cond ] ) is violated energy in the envelope is transported by convection . in this study",
    "we assume that convection is so effective that the temperature gradient in the convective parts of the envelope is equal to the adiabatic temperature gradient @xmath30 .",
    "this is equivalent to supplementing ( [ eq : pressure ] ) with adiabatic equation of state ( isentropic gas ) @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the adiabatic constant  measure of the gas entropy .",
    "this approximation should be good enough in the dense regions of the envelope ( very good in the interiors of present day giant planets ) . in appendix",
    "[ ap : conv_efficiency ] we determine under what circumstances this zero entropy gradient assumption is valid in the atmospheres of protoplanetary cores .",
    "we suppose the luminosity @xmath27 to be derived from the accretion of planetesimals and neglect the additional energy release due to the radioactive heating and differentiation inside the core .",
    "thus we take @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a planetesimal accretion rate . in appendix",
    "[ ap : acc_rate ] we briefly summarize three different regimes of planetesimal accretion important for the core growth , and calculate @xmath41 and accretion timescale for each of them . equation ( [ eq : luminosity ] ) assumes that ( a ) planetesimal velocity at infinity relative to the core is not too large compared to the core s escape speed , and ( b ) planetesimals penetrate to the core surface without much resistance from the envelope and release there all their kinetic energy .",
    "first assumption is quite reasonable during the buildup of the core by planetesimal accretion ; second should be valid for large planetesimals but small ones may be slowed down by the gas drag in the envelope as they make their way to the core surface . in the latter case accretion energy release",
    "does not occur exactly at the core surface but is distributed throughout the envelope , meaning that luminosity depends on @xmath24 .",
    "however , even in the most unfavorable case of small planetesimals which are quasi - statically lowered from the top of the atmosphere to its bottom , luminosity is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the core radius , i.e. luminosity is not constant only very near the core s surface ( pollack 1996 ) . beyond several @xmath43 , in the bulk of the envelope , we can still safely assume that @xmath27 is constant and given by ( [ eq : luminosity ] ) .",
    "use of the steady state equations ( [ eq : pressure ] ) and ( [ eq : rad_trans ] ) tacitly assumes that envelope can quickly adjust to the changes in the core mass @xmath23 and luminosity @xmath27 caused by the planetesimal accretion . in other words , these equations hold only provided that the dynamical and thermal timescales of the envelope are shorter than the core accretion timescale , and we demonstrate in appendix [ ap : thermal_time ] that this assumption is reasonable .",
    "we also show there that in the framework of quasi - stationary approximation energy release within the envelope due to gas accretion can be naturally neglected compared to the planetesimal accretion luminosity ( [ eq : luminosity ] ) .",
    "there are several characteristic length scales which are important for the problem at hand .",
    "one of them is the so - called hill radius @xmath44 defined by @xmath45 fluid elements at about @xmath46 from the protoplanetary core are equally affected by the core gravity and the tidal field of the central star . within the hill sphere gas dynamics",
    "is determined by the gravity of the core , while outside of it gas is subject mostly to the stellar gravity .",
    "physical size of the core @xmath43 scales with @xmath23 in the same way as @xmath46 does , meaning that their ratio @xmath47 is a constant depending only on the physical density of the protoplanet @xmath48 and the core location in the protoplanetary disk : @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "one can easily see that @xmath51 .",
    "bondi radius @xmath52 is defined as the distance from the protoplanet at which the thermal energy of the nebular gas is of the order of its gravitational energy in the potential well of the core : @xmath53 outside bondi sphere ( @xmath54 ) gravity of the core is too weak to strongly affect the gas ; consequently , gas pressure is almost equal to its nebular value @xmath55 .",
    "inside bondi sphere pressure is significantly perturbed by the protoplanetary gravity .",
    "opacity of the gas sets another important scale .",
    "we consider a rather general opacity law by assuming throughout this work that @xmath56 previous studies ( mizuno 1980 ; stevenson 1982 ) have always assumed dust opacity in the outer layers of the envelope assuming it to be constant . at the same time",
    ", opacity due to small interstellar dust grains ( smaller than the typical wavelength of the local blackbody radiation ) is thought to behave as @xmath57 ( i.e. @xmath58 ) with @xmath59 ( draine 2003 ) in the range of temperatures typical for protoplanetary disks ( although this is a statement depending on the size distribution and composition of the dust , which in the protoplanetary disks can be different from those in the ism ) .",
    "our opacity prescription ( [ eq : opacity ] ) accounts for this possibility and is more general compared to the previous treatments .",
    "opacity in the inner layers of the envelope ( likely dominated by the molecular opacity of h@xmath33 and h@xmath33o for which one has to use opacity tables ) might not be so important for the envelope structure or mass  atmosphere can be convective there , see  [ subsect : comparison ] .",
    "opacity effects are quantified by introducing a mean absorption length of photons in the nebular gas @xmath60 the exact value of @xmath61 is highly uncertain because the amount of dust and its size distribution in protoplanetary disks are poorly constrained .",
    "thus , we treat @xmath61 as a parameter and for simplicity take it to be constant throughout the nebula , independent of @xmath11 .",
    "outer parts of the protoplanetary nebula are optically thin , meaning that @xmath62 is larger than the vertical disk scale height @xmath63 .    finally , luminosity of the core sets one more length scale @xmath64 which is a size of object radiating luminosity @xmath27 at an effective temperature @xmath9 . in figure",
    "[ fig : scales ] we plot @xmath65 together with other length scales as a function of @xmath11 for two values of @xmath61 and for different accretion regimes ( see appendix [ ap : acc_rate ] ) .    nebula can be considered homogeneous on the scale of @xmath52 only if @xmath52 is small compared to the disk scaleheight @xmath66 .",
    "this condition puts the following constraint on the mass of the core : @xmath67 whenever this condition is fulfilled the bondi radius is also smaller than @xmath46 , while @xmath46 is smaller than @xmath66 , see equation ( [ eq : r_b ] ) . for @xmath68 bondi radius",
    "lies outside @xmath46 and nebular gas in the hill sphere is very inhomogeneous ( @xmath69 ) and strongly perturbed by the protoplanetary gravity . at @xmath70 au ( [ eq : m_1 ] ) constrains @xmath23 to be less than @xmath71 , while at @xmath72 au @xmath73 .",
    "note that ( [ eq : m_1 ] ) is also an approximate condition for the absence of strong spatial gradients in the nebula caused by the dissipation of the core - induced density waves ( lin & papaloizou 1993 ; rafikov 2002 ) . as a result , one does not have to worry about the gap formation",
    ".    with the use of ( [ eq : m_1 ] ) one can rewrite ( [ eq : bondi ] ) in the following form : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is another fiducial mass scale .",
    "if the core mass @xmath23 is smaller than @xmath76 then @xmath77 , meaning that the protoplanet is too small to induce appreciable pressure perturbations in the surrounding gas even at its surface and thus has no atmosphere associated with it .",
    "we will study only the cores satisfying @xmath78 since they are massive enough to possess atmospheres and small enough for the surrounding gas to be thought of as roughly homogeneous on the scale of @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath79 .",
    "one can see that the mass range in which ( [ eq : cond ] ) is valid is rather large and spans @xmath80 orders of magnitude depending on @xmath11 ( e.g. from @xmath81 lunar mass to @xmath82 at @xmath70 au ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : regions ] we demonstrate how the different length scales are related to each other as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath83 , constrained by ( [ eq : cond ] ) .",
    "boundary conditions to the equations of  [ sect : struct ] specify that gas pressure , temperature , and density should reduce to their nebular values @xmath55 , @xmath9 , and @xmath84 at some distance @xmath85 from the core : @xmath86 the problem then is to determine the value of @xmath85 .    the most simplistic way of evaluating @xmath85 would be to completely neglect the fact that the nebula surrounding the core is in the differential motion caused by the gravity of the central star .",
    "if one does this and assumes gas to be static everywhere , then @xmath85 can be set equal to infinity .",
    "presence of the shearing motion in the nebula drastically changes the dynamical and thermal behavior of the gas in the core s vicinity .",
    "first , gas inside the hill sphere moves in a rather complicated way as demonstrated by the the hydrodynamical simulations of planet - disk interaction ( e.g. dangelo 2002 , 2003 ) ; but we can hope that this will not violate our assumption of nebula homogeneity in the core vicinity if @xmath87 ( or @xmath88 ) .",
    "second , the flow of the nebular gas within the hill sphere can effectively `` cool '' the outer part of the envelope by advecting the gas heated by the core s accretional energy release away from the core and bringing in fresh gas having entropy equal to the nebular entropy .",
    "this process should determine the value of @xmath85 at which temperature drops to @xmath9 .",
    "apparently , @xmath89 since gas within bondi sphere is confined by the core s gravity and is not being refreshed . at the same time , the distance from the core center at which the boundary condition for the pressure is imposed is determined by a different process  dominance of the core gravity over the thermal pressure in the nebula ( and , possibly , over the centrifugal forces induced by the fluid motion around the gravitationally bound part of the envelope which we neglect in this study ) .",
    "apparently , pressure may converge to @xmath55 only beyond @xmath52 ; thus , we again arrive at the restriction @xmath89 but now from the point of view of pressure balance .    a proper estimate of distance @xmath85 at which the thermal and pressure boundary conditions are imposed must include inhomogeneous heating within @xmath85 , geometry of the flow near the core , vertical structure of the nebula , possibility of formation of rotationally supported disk around the core , and so on . this is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "fortunately , it turns out ( see  [ subsect : assumptions ] ) that the exact value of @xmath85 is not important for the envelope structure as long as @xmath90 ( we checked this to be true ) ; in our calculations we simply set @xmath91 .",
    "relationships between the various length scales defined in  [ sect : length_scales ] are quite different in the inner and outer parts of the nebula .",
    "as figure [ fig : regions ] demonstrates , for protoplanetary cores with @xmath92 accreting planetesimals in the fast regime at @xmath93 au , one of the two sets of inequalities @xmath94 is typically fulfilled depending on @xmath11 and @xmath61 .",
    "this is mainly because the planetesimal accretion rate @xmath41 and nebular gas density @xmath84 decrease with @xmath11 reducing @xmath65 and increasing @xmath62 . for smaller cores or slower accretion regime these conditions can hold even closer to the sun .",
    "we demonstrate later on that when either ( [ eq : inequality1 ] ) or ( [ eq : inequality1 ] ) is valid , there exists an almost isothermal radiative layer in the outer part of the envelope which decouples its interior from the nebular gas .",
    "although the structure of this layer is slightly different in two cases , properties of the inner envelope will be shown to be universal .      whenever the photon mean - free path @xmath62 is shorter than the bondi radius @xmath52 , envelope is optically thick to the escaping radiation . in this case",
    "its structure is completely determined by equations ( [ eq : pressure ] ) and ( [ eq : rad_trans ] ) . integrating them together with ( [ eq : opacity ] ) and using boundary condition @xmath97 when @xmath98 ( at @xmath99 , see [ [ eq : bound ] ] ) one finds that @xmath100,\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\nabla_0\\equiv\\frac{1+\\alpha}{4-\\beta } \\label{eq : purely_rad_sol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] constant @xmath101 is positive whenever @xmath22 increases with depth",
    "; we assume this to be the case which requires @xmath102 since normally opacity does not decrease with increasing density ( i.e. @xmath103 ) .",
    "the meaning of @xmath101 will become clear later on ( see  [ subsect : convection ] ) .",
    "the coefficient in the right hand side of ( [ eq : purely_rad_sol ] ) is very large because of ( [ eq : inequality2 ] ) , so that a large change of pressure results in only a small perturbation of temperature .    to make further progress we need to substitute ( [ eq : purely_rad_sol ] ) into either ( [ eq : pressure ] ) or ( [ eq : rad_trans ] ) and find the @xmath21 and @xmath22 dependencies on @xmath24",
    "this can be done numerically for arbitrary @xmath104 and @xmath105 . here",
    "we look at the asymptotic behavior of the envelope properties in two limiting cases : in the outer atmosphere where @xmath106 , and deep in the envelope where @xmath107 .    in the first case envelope",
    "is essentially isothermal ; solving ( [ eq : pressure ] ) under this assumption one obtains @xmath108 temperature profile can then be simply obtained from ( [ eq : purely_rad_sol ] ) as @xmath109 - 1\\right\\ } , \\label{eq : t_small}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where boundary conditions ( [ eq : bound ] ) were again used .",
    "one can see from ( [ eq : t_small ] ) that temperature perturbation at @xmath110 is small because @xmath111 ; at the same time gas density and pressure within bondi sphere grow exponentially , see ( [ eq : exp_structure ] ) .",
    "gas temperature rises to several times @xmath9 only when the distance to the core center becomes as small as @xmath112 apparently , @xmath113 although one should keep in mind that @xmath114 depends on @xmath115 only logarithmically .",

    "deep in the envelope ( below the photosphere ) optical depth increases and atmosphere becomes optically thick .",
    "gas is optically thick also far from the core since the density and temperature scale height is @xmath130 there and the optical depth to radiation escaping from the core becomes larger than unity at @xmath131 .",
    "of course , this outer optically thick region can only exist if @xmath132 and nebula is homogeneous on scales @xmath133 , which is not the case in the outer parts of protoplanetary disks ( but this turns out not to be important ) .",

    "thus , we express envelope temperature profile above the photosphere as @xmath136 the second term on the right hand side is relevant for the optically thin region while the third becomes important outside of @xmath137 where photons couple to the nebular gas and start to diffuse .    gas pressure is close to @xmath55 for @xmath54 . assuming that @xmath138 everywhere in this region we have @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",

    "temperature in the radiative zone does not deviate strongly from @xmath9 and we can be more confident that the opacity behavior in this region can be represented by a simple power law dependence ( [ eq : opacity ] ) . this assertion becomes even more robust if opacity there is also independent of gas density ( since density strongly varies within the radiative zone ) , and this is the case when opacity is dominated by dust absorption .    in the case of atmosphere",

    "lower entropy means higher density resulting in a higher @xmath224 compared to the mass which an isentropic atmosphere would have for the same core mass .",

    "there are discrepancies between the theory and numerical results at large @xmath11 which are especially pronounced in figure [ fig : crit_mass]a .",

    "one of the major results of our study is a clear distinction between protoplanetary atmospheres having convective outer region which smoothly merges with the surrounding nebula and atmospheres having radiative zone separating dense and hot interior from the nebula .",

    "this segregation of atmospheres into two major classes depends to some extent on whether the outer parts of the atmosphere are optically thick or thin .",
    "for example , envelope structure in the optically thick case depends only on the value of the dimensionless parameter @xmath269  roughly the inverse of the radiative temperature gradient far from the core ( see [ [ eq : bondi ] ] , [ [ eq : lambda ] ] , [ [ eq : r_l ] ] , and [ [ eq : defs ] ] ) , and is completely insensitive to the individual relationships between @xmath62 , @xmath65 , and @xmath52 ( as long as @xmath270 ) : envelope has outer convective zone when @xmath271 and outer radiative zone when @xmath272 .",

    "separation between the two classes of atmospheres in the optically thin case is somewhat more complicated ( e.g. see constraint [ [ eq : inequality1 ] ] ) and one has to pay attention to the individual relationships between the three length scales .",
    "results of  [ sect : solutions ] & [ sect : solutions_inner ] cover all such possibilities .    because these characteristic length scales vary with the distance from the sun , a specific type of atmosphere forming around the core of a given mass depends on @xmath11 .",
    "this is caused primarily by the variation of the planetesimal accretion rate throughout the protoplanetary disk : in the terrestrial region the planetesimal surface density is high while the dynamical timescale is short leading to high @xmath41 , large @xmath65 , and small @xmath115 .",
    "another important factor is a steep dependence of @xmath62 on @xmath11 ( see figure [ fig : scales ] ) . as a result , atmospheres around massive cores in the inner parts of protoplanetary disks ( within roughly @xmath273 au depending on the planetesimal accretion regime ) where @xmath274 possess outer convective zones , see figure [ fig : regions]a . on the contrary , in the region of giant planets both @xmath275 and @xmath276 are small , which decreases @xmath41 making @xmath65 small as well .",

    "some exceptions are possible ( e.g. cores having @xmath278 and @xmath279 in the region of giant planets have convective outer atmospheres , see  [ sect : solutions_inner ] and figure [ fig : regions ] ) but they typically occur for rather small cores unable of retaining massive atmospheres .      envelopes with the outer convective region have been previously considered by perri & cameron ( 1974 ) , wuchterl ( 1993 ) , and ikoma ( 2001 ) , who found the masses of such envelopes to be rather small which translated into large critical core mass .",

    "wuchterl ( 1993 ) suggested that the sensitivity to external conditions is a consequence of envelopes being fully convective , but as we demonstrate in  [ sect : solutions_inner ] what is really important is the convection _ in the outermost region of atmosphere _ only , independent of whether the atmospheric interior is convective or radiative .",
    "presence of the outer convective region sets entropy of the inner atmosphere equal to the entropy of the nebular gas , so that variations in the external conditions directly affect the overall structure ( and mass ) of the envelope .",
    "nebular entropy is quite high , which makes atmospheres not very dense and accounts for the low masses of such envelopes , see figure [ fig : env_mass ] .",
    "as our analysis demonstrates , perri & cameron ( 1974 ) and wuchterl ( 1993 ) have probably stretched their assumptions too far by calculating @xmath280 m@xmath1 for convective envelopes at @xmath124 au , in the region of giant planets , where atmospheres should in fact have outer radiative ( not convective ) zones .",
    "envelopes possessing a radiative region between the inner , dense parts of the atmosphere and the nebular gas outside have first been studied numerically by harris ( 1978 ) , mizuno ( 1978 ) , and hayashi ( 1979 ) .",
    "mizuno ( 1980 ) and stevenson ( 1982 ) were the first to notice that presence of the outer radiative region makes critical core mass virtually independent upon the density and temperature of the surrounding gas , provided that the opacity in the outer atmosphere is _ constant _ , i.e. @xmath37 is independent of either gas pressure or temperature ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "this is completely different from envelopes having outer convective region and occurs because outer radiative zone decouples inner atmosphere from the surrounding nebula . as we demonstrated in ",
    "[ subsect : mass_rad ] this insensitivity of @xmath250 to the external nebular conditions holds also in a more general case of @xmath58 and arbitrary @xmath105 ( opacity independent on the gas density ) , see equation ( [ eq : indep ] ) .",
    "this scaling is typical for the dust opacity which should dominate @xmath5 g@xmath6 ] over the molecular opacity due to h@xmath33 and h@xmath33o under the conditions typical in the outer radiative zone , see opacity plots in hayashi ( 1979 ) and mizuno ( 1980 ) and figures [ fig : rad_str_5_5 ] & [ fig : rad_str_10_30 ] .",
    "thus , one would naturally expect envelope mass and critical core mass to be independent of @xmath84 and @xmath9 ( except for the local value of opacity @xmath61 which may scale with local temperature @xmath9 ) ; this result is also completely insensitive to the structure of the innermost part ( @xmath165 ) of the envelope , be it radiative or convective . of course , as soon as @xmath104 is nonzero , this degeneracy breaks and critical core mass starts to depend on @xmath9 and @xmath84 , as equation ( [ eq : dep ] ) demonstrates .",
    "previous studies self - consistently accounting for the presence of the outer radiative zone ( hayashi 1979 ; mizuno 1980 ; stevenson 1982 ; nakazawa 1985 ; ikoma 2000 ) have found @xmath282 m@xmath1 , depending on the dust opacity and accretion luminosity of the core .",
    "these authors typically assumed constant @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath283 , while we consider several possible accretion regimes taking into account the dependence of @xmath41 on the core mass and its distance from the sun .",
    "note that for the same core formation timescale our assumed accretion law @xmath284 ( see appendix [ ap : acc_rate ] ) yields higher @xmath41 in the end of core accretion than constant @xmath41 does ; this acts to increase @xmath250 .",
    "if nucleated instability sets in when envelope mass is @xmath285 of the core mass and @xmath126 @xmath5 g@xmath6 , as we assumed in all our numerical estimates , we find that critical core mass in the fast regime of planetesimal accretion is @xmath286 m@xmath1 at @xmath124 au ( present jupiter s location ) and @xmath287 m@xmath1 at @xmath70 au ( current saturn s location ) . in the intermediate accretion regime @xmath250",

    "ikoma ( 2000 ) have found values of @xmath250 that are somewhat lower ( sometimes by @xmath291 ) than those found in this work for the same @xmath41 and @xmath61 because they used opacity in the outer atmosphere independent of @xmath21 and @xmath22 which has effect of increasing @xmath224 ( see below ) while we use realistic dust opacity .",
    "our neglect of atmospheric self - gravity is another reason for this difference .",
    "inner envelope ( @xmath165 ) can be either radiative or convective , depending on the detailed opacity behavior .",
    "we found that this part of atmosphere is radiative provided that @xmath104 and @xmath105 in ( [ eq : opacity ] ) are such that the condition ( [ eq : cond_rad ] ) is fulfilled ; if @xmath180 the inner envelope must be convective .",
    "stevenson ( 1982 ) used constant opacity in his study which made the entire envelope convectively stable and energy was transferred solely by radiation . on the other hand , in the important case of opacity dominated by small dust grains one would take @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : cond_rad ] ) demonstrates that envelopes with such opacity should be convectively unstable if they consist of diatomic gas with @xmath127 , see figures [ fig : rad_str_5_5 ] & [ fig : rad_str_10_30 ] .    of course",
    ", dust opacity can not dominate in the whole envelope  at large depth pressure and temperature are so high that h@xmath33 and h@xmath33o opacities become more important , and their behavior can not be described by a simple power law dependence ( [ eq : opacity ] ) .",
    "hayashi ( 1979 ) and mizuno ( 1980 ) showed that envelope is typically _",
    "convectively unstable _ when these molecular opacities dominate .",
    "in addition to molecular @xmath37 these authors also included constant dust opacity similar to stevenson ( 1982 ) , which had the effect of making atmosphere radiative in the outer region where @xmath37 was dominated by dust and convective at greater depth where molecular opacity was more important .",
    "in their case this transition typically occurred quite deep in the envelope , way below what we would call @xmath114 .",
    "presence of such extensive radiative zone increases @xmath224 and decreases @xmath250 : as long as @xmath178 , density in the radiative region varies as @xmath292 and atmospheric mass is evenly distributed in equal logarithmic intervals in @xmath24 , see appendix [ ap : mass ] .",
    "this augments total envelope mass compared to the mass contained in just the outermost part near @xmath114 by additional factor equal to the logarithm of ratio of the outer to inner radii of this radiative zone ( and this ratio is large ) .",
    "but if one uses opacity with @xmath180 then there is no radiative region below @xmath114 , envelope becomes convective at much smaller depth , right below @xmath114 , and most of the atmospheric mass is concentrated near @xmath114 , see appendix [ ap : mass ] .",
    "we expect the latter to occur [ and @xmath250 to be higher than what hayashi ( 1979 ) , mizuno ( 1980 ) and ikoma ( 2000 ) have found ] whenever opacity is dominated by small dust grains , since @xmath58 and @xmath59 in this case .",
    "convection at small depth in the case of dust opacity also wipes out the need to know the molecular opacities deep inside the atmosphere very accurately : behavior of @xmath37 there is irrelevant as long as envelope is convective below @xmath114 .      our results for the critical core mass necessary to trigger the nucleated instability fall within the range of previously estimated values of @xmath250 .",

    "perri & cameron ( 1974 ) and wuchterl ( 1993 ) , who studied convective envelopes , would have obtained the same value of @xmath250 if they were to calculate it at 1 au .    at the same time ,",
    "accretion in the intermediate or fast regime which keeps @xmath65 high can only proceed for rather limited time span at @xmath295 au until the isolation mass is reached ( lissauer 1993 ) . beyond this point",
    "protoplanetary cores accrete basically at their geometric cross - section , i.e. in the slow accretion regime ( appendix [ ap : acc_rate ] ; goldreich 2004 ) , for which @xmath115 could be somewhat higher than 1 .",
    "after this transition occurs , critical core mass at @xmath235 au goes down to about @xmath70 m@xmath1 ( see figure [ fig : crit_mass ] ) .",
    "inward from @xmath235 au , in the region where `` hot jupiters '' were discovered , @xmath250 decreases and reaches @xmath296 m@xmath236 at @xmath4 au .",
    "since the amount of refractory material in the inner parts of protoplanetary disks is rather small and it takes very long time ( @xmath297 yr , see chambers 2001 ) to collect this material into @xmath295 m@xmath1 protoplanets , we conclude that cores forming in situ in the terrestrial zone would not be able to undergo nucleated instability before gas in the nebula has gone away ( within @xmath298 yr ) .",
    "these considerations strengthen the argument according to which `` hot jupiters '' or their massive progenitor cores have migrated to their present locations from elsewhere .",
    "although masses of existing terrestrial planets are clearly too low to drive the nucleated instability , they were high enough to retain quite substantial atmospheres while the nebular gas was still around .",

    "massive primordial atmosphere can cause severe blanketing and melting of the core surface , effect which has been first considered by hayashi ( 1979 ) .    as we demonstrated in  [",
    "subsect : comparison ] critical core mass in the region of giant planets sensitively depends on the accretion regime : at @xmath70 au it is less than m@xmath1 in the slow regime and as large as @xmath306 m@xmath1 in the fast . at the same time",
    ", present mass of the jupiter s solid core is estimated to be @xmath307 m@xmath1 ; current saturn s core mass is between @xmath70 m@xmath1 and @xmath308 m@xmath1 ( saumon & guillot 2004 ) .",
    "the initial core masses of these two planets could have been higher  their total masses in high - z elements can be as high as @xmath309 m@xmath1 because some refractory materials can be dissolved in their envelopes .",
    "transporting these elements from the core into the envelope would require some quite efficient mixing process such as vigorous convection ( stevenson 1982 ) and it is not clear at present if this is possible .",
    "accumulation of the solid cores in the giant planet region must have proceeded in the intermediate or fast accretion regime ( or some combination of the two ) because smaller @xmath41 would not allow solid cores to form before the nebula dissipation this far from the sun .",
    "this translates into values of @xmath250 which are higher than the present core masses of jupiter and saturn .",
    "thus , current data suggest that if cores were not initially more massive and subsequently eroded they were not large enough to trigger nucleated instability and accrete gas .",
    "the discrepancy is especially dramatic for jupiter with its very low @xmath23 .",
    "one way to resolve this paradox is to hypothesize that nebular opacity @xmath61 was lower than @xmath4 @xmath5 g@xmath6 which brings @xmath250 down , see ( [ eq : m_cr_rad ] ) .",
    "another possibility is suggested by the observation that core formation in the intermediate or fast regime can take rather short time , of order several myrs , see ( [ eq : t_acc ] ) . in this case , after the core of jupiter has been mostly formed , there was still enough gas around to accumulate atmosphere . at this point , since the isolation mass has been reached , planetesimal accretion became considerably slower meaning that @xmath250 went down dramatically , below already accumulated @xmath23 .",
    "as a result , gaseous envelope could not be supported by the energy release due to the significantly lowered @xmath41 and it started to slowly contract on a thermal timescale .",
    "thus , the transition between different planetesimal accretion regimes must be accompanied by the period of envelope adjustment similar to that described in introduction .",
    "after @xmath224 reached @xmath310 runaway gas accretion commenced .",
    "similar scenario was studied numerically by pollack ( 1996 ) and ikoma ( 2000 ) .",
    "we envisage the same picture to hold for saturn as well , although its core must have taken longer to form than that of jupiter and the nebula was appreciably depleted by that time ; this may account for the smaller gaseous mass of saturn .",
    "assembly of the cores of ice giants  uranus and neptune  would have required even more time .",
    "relatively small atmospheres of these planets containing only @xmath311 m@xmath1 of h and he suggest that they either never underwent nucleated instability , or if they did this happened only after nebula has been very strongly depleted . in the former case",
    "all the gas that we see now in uranus and neptune has come from steady state atmospheres around the cores which were less massive than present cores of ice giants ; after nebula went away these ( sub - isolation mass ) cores merged retaining their gaseous content ( genda & abe 2003 , 2004 ) and producing uranus and neptune . in the latter case fast accretion leads to the accumulation of isolation mass ( essentially the present day mass of ice giants ) and to subsequent nucleated instability before the nebula dispersal",
    "; however , if at that moment nebula was depleted by less than @xmath312 , neptune and uranus would have much higher gaseous masses than they do now .",
    "critical mass rather strongly depends on the envelope composition , namely on @xmath15 .",
    "stevenson ( 1982 ) was the first to notice this fact for purely radiative atmospheres .",
    "our equation ( [ eq : m_cr_rad ] ) confirms and generalizes this observation  we find @xmath313 for _ any _ envelope with the outer radiative zone ( independent of whether its interior is radiative or convective ) .",
    "dissolution of infalling planetesimals , erosion of the core by vigorous convection , or evaporation of some volatile icy content of the core can increase @xmath15 and decrease @xmath250 considerably ( `` superganymedean puffballs '' , stevenson 1984 ) . on the other hand , envelope enrichment in high - z elements",
    "might also increase opacity in the outer atmosphere and this can at least partially counteract the decrease of @xmath250 due to large @xmath15 .      because of the inherently analytical nature of this study aimed at singling out the most important aspects of atmospheric structure we have neglected a number of relevant phenomena which may be important in some cases . among them",
    "are the dissolution of infalling planetesimals ( pollack 1996 ) , opacity jumps due to dust grain melting ( mizuno 1980 ) , increase of planetesimal capture cross - section caused by the presence of the atmosphere ( inaba & ikoma 2003 ) , etc .",
    "we have also employed a set of simplifying assumptions such as hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium of atmosphere , negligible gas accretion luminosity , and so on . in appendix",
    "[ ap : thermal_time ] we demonstrate these assumptions to be valid .",
    "our treatment of convection relies on the absence of entropy gradient in the convective regions and in appendix [ ap : conv_efficiency ] we checked whether this assumption is appropriate .",
    "all our results are rather insensitive to the exact value of distance @xmath85 at which atmosphere finally merges with the nebula as long as @xmath89 .",
    "this is because atmospheric pressure outside @xmath52 is not very different from @xmath55  planetary gravity can not strongly perturb the pressure , while temperature is not very different from @xmath9 : in the case of envelopes having outer convective zone deviation of @xmath22 from @xmath9 is directly related to the deviation of @xmath21 from @xmath55 by the condition of adiabaticity and , consequently , must be small outside of bondi sphere . in the case of envelopes having outer radiative zone temperature gradient",
    "is subadiabatic meaning that temperature deviation outside @xmath52 is even smaller than in the convective case . as a result ,",
    "atmospheric pressure and temperature are not very different from their nebular values already at @xmath52 and the exact location where @xmath21 and @xmath22 closely match @xmath55 and @xmath9 is not very important .",
    "our use of opacity in the form ( [ eq : opacity ] ) may seem an oversimplification compared to other treatments ( e.g. mizuno 1980 ; ikoma 2000 ) which employ realistic opacity tables",
    ". however , as mentioned previously , we expect @xmath37 in the outer part of the envelope to be dominated by dust and this typically ( for @xmath59 ) leads to convection inward from @xmath114 obviating the need to know the gaseous opacity behavior at high temperatures and pressures .",
    "some effect on the envelope mass and critical core mass might come from the change of equation of state caused by dissociation and ionization in the deep interior of the atmosphere , which e.g. might lead to the appearance of radiative regions at large depth .",
    "however , since atmospheric mass budget is dominated by the outer part of the envelope at @xmath229 , change of @xmath37 or @xmath31 deeper down hopefully would not strongly affect the value of @xmath224 .",
    "thus , we expect our simple analytical treatment to provide robust qualitative picture of the envelope structure and its dependence upon local conditions in the protoplanetary disk , and yield reasonable quantitative estimates of @xmath224 and @xmath250 .",
    "we investigated steady - state structure of the atmosphere around protoplanetary core immersed in the gaseous disk .",
    "our major results can be summarized as follows .",
    "atmospheres split into those having outer convective or outer radiative ( almost isothermal ) zone .",
    "the former have entropy of the interior equal to the entropy of the surrounding nebular gas ; the latter have interior entropy which is much lower than the nebular entropy , owing to the decoupling provided by the outer radiative region .",
    "type of atmosphere around a given core is determined by the relationships between the bondi radius @xmath52 , photon mean free path @xmath62 , and luminosity radius @xmath65 . if envelope is optically thick at the bondi radius ( @xmath314 ) atmospheric type is set only by the value of the dimensionless parameter @xmath115 , inverse of which has a meaning of radiative temperature gradient far from the core : outer envelope is convective when @xmath294 , while when this parameter is @xmath315 atmosphere has an outer radiative zone . for the conditions typical in the protoplanetary disks ( such as mmsn ) cores having atmospheres of the first kind are common in the terrestrial planet region ; in the region of giant planets atmospheres have outer radiative zone .",
    "structure of the atmospheric interior is determined by the dependence of opacity on gas temperature and pressure ; it becomes especially simple ( convective as soon as temperature starts to appreciably vary with depth ) if opacity is dominated by small dust grains .    in the terrestrial region",
    "critical core mass for nucleated instability @xmath250 depends only on the local values of nebular gas density and temperature . in the region of giant planets",
    "@xmath250 is insensitive to either @xmath84 or @xmath9 whenever opacity in the outer radiative zone is independent of the gas pressure , because outer radiative zone decouples inner parts of the envelope from the nebular gas ( irrespective of whether the atmospheric interior is radiative or convective ) ; at the same time @xmath250 is a strong function of accretion luminosity , opacity , and mean molecular weight .",
    "critical core mass varies as a function of distance from the sun because of the variation of @xmath84 and @xmath9 in the terrestrial planet region and because of the variation of planetesimal accretion luminosity and photon mean free path in the region of giant planets",
    ". typical value of @xmath250 is several tens of @xmath316 in the giant planet region ( @xmath317 m@xmath1 at @xmath124 au ) if planetesimal accretion was fast enough to account for the core formation prior to the gas dissipation .",
    "close to the sun , at @xmath318 au , @xmath319 m@xmath1 independent of the planetesimal accretion rate .",

    "we call this regime _",
    "slow accretion_. it may occur in planetesimal disks after cores have reached isolation mass by oligarchic growth ( chambers 2001 ; goldreich 2004 ) .",
    "second regime of _ intermediate accretion _ takes place when random velocities of planetesimals are of the order of shear velocity across the hill radius of the core @xmath323 . in this case",
    "gravitational focusing strongly increases accretion cross - section above its geometric value , and @xmath324 .",
    "note that this case corresponds to the boundary between the shear- and dispersion - dominated dynamical regimes ( stewart & ida 2000 ) ; it also assumes vertical scaleheight of the planetesimal disk to be @xmath325 .",
    "this regime may occur during the oligarchic growth of protoplanetary embryos by accretion of large planetesimals ( kokubo & ida 1998 ; rafikov 2003b ) .",
    "finally , third regime is realized when random velocities of planetesimals are so low that planetesimal disk is geometrically very thin and essentially two - dimensional . for that one",
    "needs random velocities to be smaller than @xmath326 , which leads to a _ rapid accretion _ with @xmath327 .",
    "such dynamically `` cold '' planetesimal populations can occur even in the presence of massive cores provided that some dissipative process such as gas drag can effectively damp planetesimal velocities .",
    "this can happen if fragmentation of large planetesimals in collisions at high velocities ( induced by the gravity of protoplanetary cores ) is capable of channeling a significant amount of mass initially locked up in large planetesimals into small bodies ; see rafikov ( 2003a , b ) for details of this scenario .",
    "it is likely that each of these accretion regimes can take place during some stage of protoplanetary growth , e.g. starting with intermediate , switching to rapid ( or some mixture of rapid and intermediate , depending on the fragmentation timescale , see rafikov [ 2003b ] ) , and , possibly , ending with a slow accretion phase .",

    "our use of equation ( [ eq : polytrope ] ) relies on the assumption of convection so efficient that even infinitesimal deviation of temperature gradient from @xmath30 is enough to transport the energy flux produced at the core surface . if this is not the case one has to use mixing - length theory ( kippenhahn & weigert 1990 ) to determine the value of @xmath29",
    "; here we check if this is ever necessary .",
    "following kippenhahn & weigert ( 1990 ) we introduce @xmath365 where @xmath248 is a mixing length parameter , @xmath366 is the pressure scaleheight , and @xmath367 is a deviation of temperature gradient from @xmath30 , which has to be much smaller than unity for ( [ eq : polytrope ] ) to apply .",
    "value of @xmath367 has to be obtained from the following equation ( kippenhahn & weigert 1990 ) : @xmath368 it is clear from this equation that @xmath369 whenever @xmath370 , and @xmath371 , since under these assumptions @xmath372 .",
    "thus , we look for conditions under which @xmath373 .    in light of the results of  [ subsect : convection ] & [",
    "sect : solutions_inner ] we describe the profiles of temperature , density , and pressure in the convective part of envelope by @xmath374 where @xmath375 are values of temperature , density and pressure at the boundary of the convective zone @xmath376 . in the case of an atmosphere with the outer radiative zone studied in ",
    "[ subsect : convection ] one has @xmath377 , and ( [ eq : conv_struct ] ) reduces to ( [ eq : conv_sol ] ) . in the case of atmosphere with the outer convective zone @xmath378 and ( [ eq : conv_struct ] ) yields ( [ eq : conv_sol_out ] ) .",
    "one expects deviations of @xmath367 from zero to be most pronounced in the outer , low density part of the atmosphere which might not be capable of efficient mixing .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath379 in the case of outer radiative zone , and @xmath380 in the case of outer convective zone , but in both cases @xmath381 . in the atmospheres of first type ( @xmath382 ) we find for @xmath383 using ( [ eq : t_conv ] ) , ( [ eq : p_conv ] ) , ( [ eq : r_a ] ) that @xmath384 also @xmath385 at @xmath193 , meaning that @xmath386 and @xmath387 .",
    "thus , in the region of giant planets ( @xmath388 au ) convection is efficient in the envelopes of protoplanetary cores accreting planetesimals in the slow or intermediate regime . in the case of fast accretion deviations of @xmath29 from @xmath30 at the level of @xmath2 might be expected in the outermost parts of convective zone , at @xmath193 .    in the case of envelopes having outer convective zone ( @xmath389 )",
    "one finds for @xmath390 expression similar to ( [ eq : u_rad ] ) but without @xmath391 terms . also , @xmath392 at @xmath393 . as a result , @xmath394 these estimates demonstrate that in protoplanetary atmospheres around the cores at @xmath318 au , which are likely to have outer convective zones , deviations from purely isentropic convection may only be important for fast and intermediate accretion regimes .",
    "these are the occurrences when the temperature gradient can go superadiabatic at the outer edge of the convection zone and one would get a more accurate estimate of @xmath29 in the convective regions by actually solving ( [ eq : x_eq ] ) , e.g. see papaloizou & terquem ( 1999 ) .",
    "we do not expect this possible superadiabaticity in some localized parts of atmosphere to strongly affect our estimates of @xmath224 and @xmath250 since deeper down in the envelope density increases , convection becomes more efficient at transporting the energy , and entropy gradient goes to zero ."

    "<S> a specific type of gaseous envelope which accumulates around a given core depends only on the relations between the bondi radius of the core , photon mean free path in the nebular gas , and the luminosity radius ( roughly the size of the sphere which can radiate accretion luminosity of the core at an effective temperature equal to the local nebular temperature ) . </S>",
    "<S> cores in the inner parts of protoplanetary disk ( within roughly 0.3 au from the sun ) have large luminosity radii resulting in the atmospheres of the first type , while cores in the giant planet region ( beyond several au ) have small luminosity radii and always accumulate massive atmospheres of the second type . </S>",

    "<S> critical core mass depends on the gas opacity and planetesimal accretion rate but is insensitive to the nebular temperature or density provided that the opacity in the outer radiative region does not depend on the gas density ( e.g. dust opacity ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is true irrespective of whether the envelope s interior is convective or radiative and numerical values of the critical core mass are similar in the two cases . </S>",
    "<S> critical mass in the region of giant planets can be as high as @xmath3 m@xmath1 ( for opacity @xmath4 @xmath5 g@xmath6 ) if planetesimal accretion is fast enough for protoplanetary cores to form prior to the nebular gas dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> this might indicate that giant planets in the solar system have gained massive gaseous atmospheres by nucleated instability only after their cores have accumulated most of the mass in solids during the epoch of oligarchic growth , subsequent to which planetesimal accretion slowed down and cores became supercritical . </S>"
