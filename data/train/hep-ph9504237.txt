    "non - electromagnetic isosopin breaking is well - established in many strongly interacting systems ( e.g. , splittings in the hadron spectrum , binding energy differences in mirror nuclei , asymmetries in polarized np scattering , binding energies and level splittings of light @xmath6 hypernuclei ) . in few - body systems ,",
    "an important source of this breaking has been thought to be the mixing of isoscalar and isovector mesons appearing in meson exchange diagrams . in particular , the bulk of the non - coulombic contributions to the charge symmetry breaking @xmath7-@xmath8 scattering length difference and to the a=3 binding energy difference , and of the np asymmetry at @xmath9 mev , can be explained using the value of @xmath10 mixing extracted from an analysis of @xmath4 in the @xmath10 interference region .",
    "the plausibility of this explanation ( which employs the observed mixing , measured at @xmath11 , unchanged in the spacelike region @xmath12 ) has , however , recently been called into question by goldman , henderson and thomas who pointed out that , in the context of a particular model , the relevant @xmath10 mixing matrix element has significant @xmath5-dependence . subsequently",
    ", various authors , employing various computational and/or model framewords , have showed that the presence of such @xmath5-dependence appears to be a common feature of isospin - breaking in both meson - propagator- and current - correlator matrix elements  .    in the present paper",
    "we will concentrate on the isospin - breaking vector current correlator @xmath13 where @xmath14    this correlator was first analyzed using qcd sum rules in ref .  , and",
    "the analysis updated by the authors of ref .   who , in particular , stressed the @xmath5-dependence of the correlator implicit in the results of this analysis . as will be shown below",
    ", a worrisome feature of the resulting fit is that the phenomenological representation of the correlator near @xmath1 is not dominated by the most nearby singularities , suggesting that some ingredient may be missing from the form chosen for this representation .",
    "this missing ingredient is identified below and it is shown that a reanalysis of the correlator , which includes it , rectifies the problem . the resulting correlator still displays a very strong @xmath5-dependence , and , in addition , provides evidence for the presence of significant direct @xmath3 coupling in @xmath4 .",
    "the behavior of the resulting correlator near @xmath1 is then compared with that obtained from chpt to one - loop .",
    "the latter is found to be more than an order of magnitude smaller than the former , the reason why this suggests the likelihood of a slow convergence of the chiral series for the correlator explained .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , those features of the behavior of quantum field theories under field redefinitions relevant to attempts in the literature to relate meson propagators and current correlators are discussed , and it is explained why the freedom of field redefinition implies that ( 1 ) one can not obtain off - shell information about the off - diagonal element of the vector meson propagator from the off - diagonal element of the vector current correlator without making specific choices for the vector meson interpolating fields , and ( 2 ) if one writes the off - diagonal element of the vector meson propagator as @xmath15 @xmath16 can not , in general , be @xmath5-independent . in section iii",
    "we return to the qcd sum rule analysis of the vector current correlator , first explaining why certain features of the existing analyses suggest the need for a modified analysis , and then performing this analysis .",
    "the results both correct the apparently unphysical features of the previous analyses and provide evidence for non - negligible direct @xmath17 contributions to @xmath4 in the @xmath10 interference region . in section iv , the correlator is computed to one - loop in chpt , and the results compared to those obtained from the sum rule analysis .",
    "implications for the discrepancy between the results of the two approaches are discussed there .",
    "finally , in section v , a brief summary of the main results of the paper is given .",
    "let us begin by clarifying the relation ( or lack thereof ) between the vector - meson - propagator and vector - current - correlator matrices .",
    "the former is an , in general , off - shell green function , which we may think of as being associated with some low - energy effective lagrangian , @xmath18 , in which the vector meson degrees of freedom have been made explicit . as is well - known",
    ", the form of such a lagrangian is not unique : if @xmath2 and @xmath19 are two possible field choices describing a given particle , related by @xmath20 , with @xmath21 , then @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath23\\equiv { \\cal l}_{eff}[\\chi f(\\chi ) ] $ ] produce exactly the same experimental observables  .",
    "however , while the s - matrix elements of the two theories are identical , this is not true of the general off - shell green functions .",
    "one is free to make field redefinitions of the form above ( as is done , e.g. , in order to obtain the canonical form of the effective lagrangian for chpt  ) without changing the physical consequences of the theory ; the green functions , however , are not in general invariant under such field redefinitions .",
    "useful pedagogical illustrations of this general principle , for pion compton scattering and the linear @xmath24-model , are given in ref .   and",
    "chapter iv of ref .  ,",
    "respectively . in the case of interest to us , what this means is that , when we make a redefinition of the @xmath25 , @xmath26 fields in @xmath27 $ ] , we generate a new effective lagrangian , @xmath28 $ ] , the green functions of which are , in general , different from those of @xmath18 ( though when we piece such green functions together to form s - matrix elements , these differences produce no net effect ) .",
    "the off - shell behavior of the vector meson propagator is thus dependent on the particular choice of fields used to represent the vector mesons ( the choice of `` interpolating field '' ) .",
    "it is not a physical observable .",
    "in contrast , the vector current correlators @xmath29 are , in fact , physical objects , independent of interpolating field choice . the spectral functions for @xmath30 and @xmath31 are , for example , accessible from a combination of @xmath32 and @xmath33 data , and that for @xmath34 could in principle be obtained from a careful analysis of the deviation of the ratio of the differential decay rates for @xmath32 and @xmath4 from that predicted by isospin symmetry .",
    "as such there can be no general ( i.e. valid for all choices of interpolating field ) relation between the correlator and propagator matrices .",
    "this point is the source of some confusion in ref .   where an attempt is made to obtain the off - shell propagator based on an analysis of the correlator .",
    "before proceeding to the reanalysis of the correlator , let us be more precise about the problems with the interpretation of the results of ref .",
    ", in the light of the above comments .",
    "the authors begin by writing a general form for the spectral function of the correlator : @xmath35 where the superscripts on the rhs should , for the moment , be taken only as labelling the region of spectral strength , and where @xmath36 refers to all other contributions ( we return to this below ) .",
    "( 2.1 ) is , of course , completely general .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    ", however , then identify @xmath37 with @xmath38 , where @xmath39 are the vector meson decay constants , defined by @xmath40 and @xmath41 with the off - diagonal element of the vector meson propagator .",
    "this amounts to assuming that the isospin - unmixed @xmath42 @xmath25 state , @xmath43 , couples only to @xmath44 , and the isospin - unmixed @xmath45 @xmath26 state , @xmath46 , only to @xmath47 , the isospin - breaking contribution to @xmath48 of eqn .",
    "( 2.2 ) from the @xmath49 region then resulting solely from the @xmath43-@xmath46 mixing in the meson propagator . in this interpretation , fixing the imaginary part of the correlator in the @xmath25 , @xmath26 region ( via the sum rule analysis ) allows one to obtain the isospin - breaking parameters of the imaginary part of the vector meson propagator , and , via a dispersion relation , the behavior of the off - diagonal element of the propagator off - shell .",
    "however , as explained above , such a possibility is excluded on general grounds . the problem with going from @xmath37 and @xmath50 of eqn",
    "( 2.2 ) to the interpretation of these quantities in ref .",
    "is that , not one , but three sources of isospin breaking exist in the contributions to @xmath48 from the @xmath25 , @xmath26 region : that due to @xmath43-@xmath46 mixing ( discussed above ) , that due to the direct coupling of @xmath44 to @xmath46 , and that due to the direct coupling of @xmath47 to @xmath43 . the same @xmath51 strong operator which gives rise to non - zero @xmath43-@xmath46 mixing will also necessarily give rise to the latter two couplings .",
    "these couplings would be described by new isospin breaking parameters , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 where @xmath53 , @xmath52 are , in general , @xmath5-dependent , and also interpolating - field - dependent off - shell .",
    "thus , off - shell , the @xmath25-@xmath26 region contribution to @xmath48 depends not only on the ( interpolating - field - choice - dependent ) isospin - breaking parameters of the off - diagonal element of the vector meson propagator , but also on the ( interpolating - field - choice - dependent ) isospin - breaking parameters @xmath53 , @xmath52 .",
    "the total contribution is independent of the interpolating field choice , but the individual contributions are not .",
    "one is , of course , free to choose a convenient set of @xmath25 , @xmath26 interpolating fields and work with these , provided one calculates contributions to s - matrix elements . since , to @xmath55 eqn .",
    "( 2.2 ) remains valid when we replace @xmath25 and @xmath26 with @xmath43 and @xmath46 , the fields @xmath56 satisfy@xmath57 and @xmath58 , and hence serve as possible choices of interpolating fields for @xmath43 and @xmath46 . with this choice of interpolating fields ( and not with others ) one obtains @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the off - diagonal element of the vector meson propagator for the interpolating field choice above .",
    "if one simultaneously evaluates , e.g. @xmath61 , @xmath62 vertex form factors using the same interpolating fields , one could , of course , piece the resulting vertices and propagators together to obtain contributions to nn scattering s - matrix elements which are independent of field choice . for a general choice of interpolating field ,",
    "however , neither @xmath48 nor @xmath50 is proportional to @xmath63 . given the existence of qcd sum rules and chpt methods , which are rather efficient at handling current - current correlators and vector current vertex functions , the choice ( 2.4 ) for vector meson interpolating fields would appear to be a convenient and sensible one . with this choice , eqn .",
    "( 2.1 ) provides the basis of a spectral representation of @xmath64 , but for other choices of the vector meson interpolating fields this is not the case .",
    "note that the above discussion also clarifies one ongoing point of debate in the literature , namely that concerning the @xmath5-dependence of the quantity @xmath16 appearing in eqn .",
    "( 1.3 ) . defining @xmath65 by @xmath66",
    "the absence of massless singularities implies that @xmath67  .",
    "this in turn implies , with @xmath68 @xmath69 , and hence @xmath70 .",
    "since this is true for one choice of the vector meson interpolating fields , it is incumbent upon those advocating @xmath71 to explicitly demonstrate the existence of an interpolating field choice for the vector mesons for which eqn .",
    "( 2.8 ) is valid ; the relation can not be true in general .",
    "with the above discussion in mind , let us turn to the sum rule analysis of the vector correlator , first briefly reviewing the treatment and results of refs .  .",
    "the sum rule approach consists of writing an operator product expansion ( ope ) representation for the correlator , valid in the region of validity of perturbative qcd , and a second , phenomenological , representation in terms of hadronic parameters , and then borel transforming both .",
    "the borel transform serves to extend the ranges of validity of both representations and , in addition , to ( 1 ) emphasize the operators of lowest dimension in the ope representation and ( 2 ) give higher weight to the parameters of the lowest lying resonances in the phenomenological representation .",
    "one then matches the transformed representations in order to make predictions for the relevant hadronic parameters .",
    "the ope for the correlator of interest was performed long ago  . truncating the expansion at operators of dimension six , one finds that , defining @xmath73 by @xmath74 one has @xmath75 \\eqnum{3.2}\\label{threeptone}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 and @xmath77\\nonumber \\\\ & & c_3=-{224\\over 81}\\pi\\left [ \\alpha_s\\langle \\bar{q } q\\rangle_0\\right]^2 \\left [ { \\alpha_{em}\\over 8\\alpha_s ( \\mu^2 ) } - \\gamma\\right ] \\eqnum{3.3}\\label{threepttwo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath78 .",
    "taking for the phenomenological representation ( in the narrow resonance approximation ) @xmath79 + \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad   { \\alpha_{em}\\over 192\\pi^2}\\ , \\eqnum{3.4}\\label{threeptthree}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( where @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 may be thought of as the parameters to be determined from the sum rule analysis ) one finds , upon borel transformation and matching , @xmath84\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad + { \\alpha_{em}\\over 16\\pi^3}\\exp ( -s_0/m^2 ) = c_0 + { c_1\\over m^2 } + { c_2\\over m^4}+{c_3\\over m^6}\\ , \\eqnum{3.5}\\label{threeptfour}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the borel mass . as pointed out in ref .",
    ", to @xmath86 , where @xmath87 , @xmath88 , eqn .",
    "( 3.5 ) can be rewritten in terms of the parameters @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , where @xmath93 with @xmath94 and @xmath95 , as @xmath96 if @xmath97 were precisely known , eqn .",
    "( 3.5 ) or eqn .  ( 3.7 ) could , in principle , be used to determine the parameters @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "there are , however , some uncertainties in the values of the @xmath98 , associated with the imprecision in our knowledge of the values of the four - quark condensates and of the isospin - breaking ratio of the @xmath99 and @xmath100 condensates . the authors of ref .   ( which updates ref .   )",
    "consider a range of possibilities for these quantities , and also take for @xmath101 the value @xmath102 , obtained from an analysis of pseudoscalar isomultiplet splittings employing dashen s theorem for the electromagnetic contributions to these splittings .",
    "the last ingredient of the analysis of ref .",
    "is the imposition of an external constraint on the hadronic parameter @xmath89 , based on the observed interference in the @xmath25-@xmath26 interference region in @xmath4 .",
    "this constrained value , @xmath103 , is based on ( 1 ) the assumed connection between the correlator and the propagator ( presumably valid for the essentially on - shell value of the mixing , though not elsewhere ) and ( 2 ) the assumption that direct @xmath104 contributions to @xmath4 can be neglected ( see ref .   for a discussion of these issues ) .",
    "there appears to be no particularly good reason for the latter assumption , and , indeed , it would seem appropriate to allow @xmath89 to be fit by the sum rule analysis as a test of this assumption ( as will be done below ) , but let us follow the analysis of ref .",
    "for the moment . using the sum rule , eqn .",
    "( 3.7 ) , and imposing the constraint @xmath103 , as discussed above , the authors of ref .",
    "solve for @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 for four different input sets @xmath105 . using the expression ( 3.4 ) for @xmath106 and the fact that @xmath73 satisfies an unsubtracted dispersion relation ,",
    "one may show that , to first order in @xmath107 and @xmath108 , @xmath109\\ .\\eqnum{3.8}\\label{threeptseven}\\ ] ] using the values of the parameters obtained in ref .",
    ", one finds that the ratios of the contributions to @xmath110 from the @xmath111-@xmath112 region to those from the @xmath25-@xmath26 region are @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath114 for input sets i , ii , iii , iv , respectively .",
    "the failure of the results to be dominated by the nearby ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) singularities suggests that the phenomenological form employed for the spectral function may well be incomplete , either in missing low - lying contributions or in failing to include the effect of even more distant singularities .",
    "if we consider eqns .",
    "( 3.4 ) and ( 3.8 ) for a moment an interesting possibility becomes evident .",
    "if one had all isospin - breaking effects generated solely by @xmath43-@xmath46 mixing , and if the physical vector mesons were a simple rotation of the isospin - pure basis ( not in general true when the wavefunction renormalization matrix of the system is non - diagonal ) , we would have @xmath116 for @xmath80 , @xmath81 as written in eqn .",
    "while the assumptions required to arrive at this conclusion are certainly not satisfied in general , this nonetheless indicates that there should be significant cancellation between the @xmath25 and @xmath26 contributions to the correlator .",
    "thus , a single isolated resonance , even with a coupling much smaller than that of the @xmath25 or @xmath26 , could in fact contribute significantly to @xmath48 .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath2 contribution to @xmath117 , neglected in ref .  , may well be non - negligible .",
    "in fact we can make a rough estimate of the expected size of @xmath118 ( where @xmath118 is defined by adding a contribution @xmath119 to @xmath106 in eqn .",
    "( 3.4 ) ) as follows .",
    "@xmath2 is known to be not quite pure @xmath120 . if , e.g. , we take the particle data group ( pdg ) value for the octet - singlet mixing angle , @xmath121 ( quadratic fit ) , @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the pure @xmath120 state and @xmath124 rad is the deviation of @xmath125 from ideal mixing",
    ". the contribution of the @xmath2 pole term to @xmath48 due to mixing in the propagator should then be of order @xmath126 times that associated with the @xmath26 pole , i.e. @xmath127 .",
    "there will , of course , also , in general , be isospin - breaking contributions from direct couplings to the current vertices , not just from mixing in the propagator , but the above discussion shows that @xmath128 should be a reasonable expectation . as we will see below ,",
    "this ( rather crude ) estimate is indeed borne out by the sum rule analysis .",
    "let us , therefore , add a term @xmath129 to @xmath106 on the rhs of eqn .",
    "( 3.4 ) , and perform a reanalysis of that equation .",
    "we will follow ref . in choosing the range of input values for the @xmath105 , with , however , the following modifications .",
    "first , the small @xmath130 term dropped in ref .",
    "will be retained , though , as pointed out there , it in fact has little effect on the final results .",
    "the numerical value is obtained by using @xmath131 from ref .   and the updated value of @xmath132 discussed below .",
    "the main modification to the input is in the parameter @xmath132 .",
    "there is now considerable evidence that dashen s theorem is significantly violated , refs .   in particular suggesting that @xmath133 ( where the factor @xmath134 on the rhs of eqn .",
    "( 3.9 ) is absent in dashen s theorem ) .",
    "using eqn .",
    "( 3.9 ) in place of dashen s theorem for the electromagnetic contribution to the kaon mass splitting produces a rescaling of @xmath132 by @xmath135 .",
    "the resulting change in the @xmath98 is essentially to rescale the values of @xmath136 in ref .   by this same factor . in assessing the effect of the uncertainties in the values of the @xmath105 for a given input set , the input errors on @xmath136",
    "have also been rescaled by this factor of @xmath135 . finally ,",
    "since the masses of all the resonances appearing above , including the @xmath111 and @xmath112 , are known , we may take these as input and use the sum rule to extract the isospin - breaking parameters , @xmath137 , where @xmath138 correspond to @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "note that , in taking this approach , we are abandoning the constraint on @xmath89 employed in ref .  .",
    "if the direct @xmath139 coupling is , indeed , negligible in @xmath4 , this will manifest itself by the value of @xmath89 resulting from the sum rule analysis being near @xmath140 .",
    "the analysis of the modified version of the sum rule , ( 3.5 ) , proceeds as follows .",
    "first , from the terms of @xmath141 , @xmath142 .",
    "one may check that , as in ref .",
    ", the analysis is very insensitive to the value of the em threshold parameter , @xmath143 .",
    "we will , therefore , quote all results below for the value , @xmath144 gev , employed in a number of the results quoted in ref .  .",
    "second , again as in ref .",
    ", we impose the local duality relation @xmath145 ( which is equivalent to matching the coefficients of the @xmath146 terms in eqn .",
    "( 3.5 ) ) . with the index",
    "@xmath147 labelling @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath2 , respectively , as above , this relation is @xmath148 ( note that the @xmath98 tabulated in ref .   have had the appropriate factors of @xmath149 required to leave the remaining coefficient dimensionless factored out of them .",
    "thus , e.g. , @xmath130 in eqn .",
    "( 3.11 ) is @xmath149 times that tabulated in ref .  . )",
    "the remaining four relations required to obtain a solution for the five unknowns , @xmath137 , are obtained by acting on eqn .",
    "( 3.5 ) with @xmath150 for @xmath151 .",
    "one may check that the results are not sensitive to using precisely the pdg values for the @xmath111 and @xmath112 masses .",
    "indeed , shifting either mass by @xmath152 mev induces changes of @xmath153 in @xmath89 , @xmath154 in @xmath90 , @xmath155 in @xmath92 and @xmath156 in @xmath91 .",
    "the resulting changes in the correlator itself are even smaller : e.g. @xmath157 and @xmath158 are changed by @xmath159 by the above mass shifts .    in table 1 , the results of the modified sum rule analysis are displayed for the input sets i , iii , iv of ref .",
    ", modified as described above .",
    "the errors shown in the table correspond to the uncertainties in the input parameters , @xmath136 and @xmath160 , ( those quoted in ref .   in the case of @xmath160 and the rescaled version thereof in the case of @xmath136 ) .",
    "the stability of the analysis is illustrated , for input set iv , in figs .  1 - 5 , which display the parameters @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath118 as a function of the borel mass , @xmath85 , in the range @xmath161-@xmath162 gev (",
    "the choice of the first four parameters , rather than corresponding @xmath163 values , is made in order to facilitate comparison with ref .  ) .",
    "set i generates results of comparable stability , while the results of set iii are even more stable than those of set iv . in all three cases a wide stability window exists in the borel mass for all five output parameters .",
    "this stability window , moreover , occurs without the necessity of using unphysical values for the the average of the @xmath111 and @xmath112 masses . as noted previously in ref .",
    ", results for input set ii are considerably less stable than for the other sets : in fact , no stability window exists anywhere in the range @xmath164 and @xmath165 gev , apart from for the very lower edge of the error band for the magnitude of @xmath160 , for which values input set ii is very close to the upper end of the corresponding error band for input set i. the instability of the analysis for input set ii is illustrated ( for the central values of @xmath136 and @xmath160 ) in fig .",
    "6 , where the parameter , @xmath118 , is plotted as a function of the borel mass , @xmath85 . as a result of this instability ,",
    "results corresponding to input set ii are not quoted in the table ; for most of the input range ( i.e. for larger values of the magnitude of @xmath160 ) the input set appears , from the sum rule analysis , to be unphysical .",
    "a number of features are evident from the results of the above analysis .",
    "first , from table  1 , we see that the magnitude of @xmath89 differs significantly from that which would be expected from the analysis of @xmath166 , neglecting @xmath139 contributions , suggesting that the latter are , indeed , not negligible .",
    "it should be stressed that the errors quoted in the table correspond to varying @xmath136 and @xmath160 separately within the range of quoted errors , and taking the maximum variation of the resulting output .",
    "one can obtain even lower values of @xmath89 , i.e. closer to that expected if one can indeed neglect @xmath139 contributions to @xmath166 , by letting @xmath136 lie at the bottom of its error band and , simultaneously , the magnitude of @xmath160 lie at the top of its error band in set i. however , such a combination ( which produces @xmath167 ) is quite unstable , the values of @xmath91 , e.g. , varying by more than @xmath168 between @xmath169 and @xmath170 gev .",
    "a similar result , @xmath171 , can be obtained from set ii for the central value of @xmath136 and the lower edge of the error band for the magnitude of @xmath160 , with comparable ( @xmath172 over the range @xmath169 to @xmath170 gev ) instability .",
    "all other portions of the set ii error band are even more unstable .",
    "thus it appears very clear that the value @xmath103 is excluded by the sum rule analysis .",
    "the second observation is that the inclusion of the @xmath2 pole term in the phenomenological representation of the correlator rectifies the problem of the strength of the distant singularities .",
    "this can be seen from the relative size of @xmath89 and @xmath91 in table 1 , but is more evident in table 2 , where the output values for the parameters @xmath137 are tabulated , for the central values of the input parameters @xmath105 , for input sets i , iii , iv .",
    "the ratios of @xmath118 to @xmath81 are @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 for sets i , iii and iv , respectively .",
    "this is in ( better than should be expected ) agreement with the rough estimate given above , confirming the physical plausibility of the solutions obtained .",
    "moreover , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are now a factor of @xmath176-@xmath177 smaller than @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the structure of the resulting contributions to the correlator near @xmath1 is shown in table 3 , where the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and also the @xmath111 , @xmath112 contributions have been combined .",
    "note that the individual @xmath25 and @xmath26 contributions are a factor of @xmath178 larger than the @xmath2 contribution , but the cancellation between them is such that the @xmath2 contribution is approximately twice as large as their sum .",
    "the @xmath111-@xmath112 region contribution is then less than @xmath179 of the @xmath2 contribution .",
    "the more distant singularities , thus , have only a small effect , justifying , _ a posteriori _ , the neglect of yet more distant singularities in the phenomenological side of the sum rule analysis . given that the results satisfy all the above tests for being physically sensible and stable , it appears that the resulting values for the correlator and its slope with respect to @xmath5 at @xmath1 should be taken as good estimates , within the uncertainties resulting from those in the input parameters .",

    "thus , @xmath220 , where the kaon mass difference is that due to the strong isospin - breaking , i.e. , with the electromagnetic contribution removed .",
    "using eqn .",

    "the one - loop chpt result is a factor of @xmath223 smaller than the sum rule result .",
    "the discrepancy between the one - loop chpt and sum rule analyses for the correlator near @xmath1 should actually not come as a complete surprise .",
    "indeed , when the leading - order contribution to a physical quantity ( order 2 in the chiral expansion ) vanishes , as it does here , one has no obvious scale to use in judging whether or not the next - to - leading - order contribution obtained is abnormally small , i.e. , whether or not the resulting one - loop expression is likely to represent a well - converged approximation to the whole chiral expansion .",
    "in fact , the structure of the expression , ( 4.3 ) , above for the correlator , @xmath73 , is such as to suggest that it is unlikely to be well - converged .",
    "the reason for this statement is that eqn .",
    "( 4.3 ) is independendent of the low - energy constants ( lec s ) , @xmath201 , and results purely from one - loop graphs involving internal kaon loops . such loops , for the non - contact graphs , are well - known to be suppressed in size ( the coefficient of @xmath5 in the leading term of @xmath224 in eqn .  ( 4.5 ) , e.g. , is a factor of @xmath225 smaller than for the corresponding @xmath226 loop integral , @xmath227 ) and , moreover , in the case at hand , i.e. the correlator @xmath73 , those terms in which this suppression would be lifted by the presence of the @xmath228 factor in the coefficient multiplying @xmath229 cancel , since the expression for the correlator involves the difference of the @xmath218 and @xmath219 loop contributions .",
    "the correlator , of course , has a cut beginning at @xmath230 , associated with @xmath231 intermediate states , but such intermediate states do not enter until two - loop order in the chiral expansion . since the relevant @xmath226 loop integral is intrinsically much larger than its kaonic counterpart , it is likely that the two - loop contributions will not be negligible , despite being higher order in the chiral expansion .    other examples of slow convergence of the chiral series when the leading contribution vanishes and the next - to - leading order contribution results purely from loop graphs ( i.e. is independent of the fourth - order lec s , @xmath201 ) are , in fact , already known .",
    "one is the process @xmath232 , whose amplitude , to one - loop order , receives contributions only from loop graphs ( though in this case , loop graphs with internal @xmath226 lines ) .",
    "the one - loop expression deviates from the experimental amplitude even very close to threshold , and one finds that extending the calculation to two - loop order ( sixth order in the chiral expansion ) produces corrections to the one - loop result of order @xmath233  , which corrections bring the amplitude into agreement with experiment .",
    "even more closely similar to the case at hand is the process @xmath234 .",
    "the one - loop amplitude again has no leading term and no contributions from the fourth order lec s , but here , although there are @xmath226 loop contributions , these contributions are suppressed by a factor @xmath235 .",
    "the @xmath236 loop contributions are naturally small , as noted above .",
    "the result is that the one - loop prediction for the partial rate is a factor of @xmath237 smaller than observed experimentally  .",
    "it is worth considering the process @xmath238 in somewhat more detail since , not only does it closely parallel the case at hand , but the physical origin of the smallness of the one - loop result for this process is well - understood .",
    "the source of the problem lies in the fact that the dominant contribution to the amplitude is known to be due to vector meson exchange  . as is well - known  , it is possible to make standard field choice for the various meson resonances and write an effective chiral lagrangian which includes both these resonances and the octet of pseudoscalar ( pseudo- ) goldstone bosons .",
    "one may then integrate out the ( heavy ) resonance fields to obtain an effective lagrangian of the form @xmath18 for the pseudoscalars alone .",
    "the resonance contributions to the lec s are then determined by the coupling parameters of the original , extended lagrangian ( which are fixed by experimental data ) .",
    "the effect of the resonances ( for the initial field choices used ) then lies solely in their contributions to the @xmath201  .",
    "those @xmath201 to which the vector and axial - vector mesons can contribute ( @xmath201 , @xmath239 ) are known to be essentially saturated by these contributions  .",
    "thus , the absence of any @xmath201-dependence in the one - loop amplitude implies the absence of the effects of vector meson exchange ( for the given initial choice of vector meson interpolating fields ) and if , as seems to be the case for @xmath238 , vector meson exchange is the dominant contribution , the one - loop amplitude can be expected to be a poor representation of the full chiral series .",
    "the vector meson contributions , in this case , first appear as tree - level contributions arising from the @xmath240 part of the effective lagrangian , not included in eqn .",
    "( 4.1 ) above ( the general form of the @xmath240 part of the effective lagrangian is given in ref .  ) .",
    "thus , only by including these contributions ( which requires , for consistency , a full two - loop - order calculation ) can one hope to obtain a well - converged approximation to the full chiral series for the amplitude .",
    "the @xmath238 discussion above can obviously be transferred directly to the case of the mixed - isospin vector current correlator under consideration here .",
    "we expect significant contributions to the correlator from the vector meson resonances and , for a particular choice of vector meson interpolating fields , these contributions are completely absent from the one - loop result . as a consequence",
    ", we can expect significant contributions from the tree - level @xmath240 terms in which such contributions reside .",
    "as already discussed , the @xmath240 loop contributions ( arising from two - loop graphs with lowest - order vertices and one - loop graphs with a single @xmath241 vertex ) may also be significant .",
    "a two - loop calculation is , therefore , almost certainly required in order to obtain convergence of the chiral series for the mixed - isospin correlator .",
    "similar statements hold for the related correlator , @xmath242 , for which work on the two - loop calculation is in progress  .",
    "note that , in the latter case , only a single combination of the @xmath240 lec s enters the two - loop result .",
    "this combination , which in the notation of ref .",
    "( where the analogous @xmath30 and @xmath31 correlators are computed to two - loop order ) , is written @xmath243 , with @xmath244 the renormalization scale , is in principle obtainable from experimental data using the chiral sum rules of ref .",
    "( 97 ) and ( 98 ) therein ) . in the case at hand ,",
    "one further @xmath241 lec and one further @xmath240 lec will be present at the two - loop level , but the sum rule analysis above , in combination with a full two - loop evaluation of @xmath73 , would provide a useful constraint on these parameters , albeit it with the @xmath245 errors displayed in table iii and associated with the uncertainties in the values of the input parameters @xmath105 which determine the correlator near @xmath1 .",
    "a similar sum rule analysis of the correlator @xmath34 would constrain the combination @xmath243 , mentioned above .",
    "it is interesting to note that the relation between the sum rule and chpt results for the mixed - isospin vector correlator is effectively the reverse of what occurs in the mixed - isospin axial correlator case . in the latter case , the chpt and sum rule results for the value of that piece of the correlator proportional to @xmath246 at @xmath1 are comparable , but the chpt result for the slope of the correlator with @xmath5 is more than an order of magnitude larger than that obtained from a sum rule analysis analogous to that employed above for the vector correlator case  .",
    "the source of the discrepancy , in the axial correlator case , is that the sum rule result for the slope has the incorrect chiral behavior , being in fact missing its leading contribution in the chiral expansion .",
    "this problem with the sum rule treatment is easily exposed using chiral methods , but is completely non - obvious without them . in the present case , since we do not know what portion of the vector meson masses survives in the chiral limit , we can not make as precise statements about the required chiral behavior of the vector correlator .",
    "there is , however , no obvious problem with the form of the sum rule result above .",
    "the sum rule result , moreover , provides clear evidence to indicate that the chiral series for the vector correlator is indeed , as suggested by analogy to the known behavior of the @xmath238 process , slowly converging .",
    "the sum rule result , in this case , should also provide useful input for the two - loop analysis in chpt . the two examples clearly indicate the advantages of applying _ both _ methods , within their common range of validity , in any given physical process .",
    "the basic results of the paper are as follows .",
    "we have demonstrated that ( 1 ) in making a sum rule analysis of the mixed - isospin vector current correlator , it is necessary to include the @xmath2 pole term in the phenomenological form of the representation of the correlator , and that , when one does so , the spectral structure of the correlator becomes physically sensible ; ( 2 ) the expression for the correlator away from @xmath11 has no general interpretation as the off - diagonal element of a vector - meson propagator except for a particular vector meson interpolating field choice ; ( 3 ) the freedom of field redefinition shows that the isospin - breaking factor @xmath247 , which occurs in the numerator of the expression , ( 1.3 ) , for the off - diagonal element of the vector meson propagator , can not , in general , be taken to be independent of @xmath5 ; ( 4 ) the behavior of the correlator near @xmath11 suggests that the direct @xmath139 contribution to @xmath4 is not negligible in the @xmath25-@xmath26 interference region ; ( 5 ) the discrepancy between the behavior of the correlator near @xmath1 as obtained from the sum rule analysis and from chpt to one - loop indicates a slow convergence of the chiral series for the correlator and , in consequence , the necessity of a two - loop calculation of this quantity in chpt .",
    "the sum rule result for the correlator near @xmath1 can then be used , in such a calculation , to constrain the @xmath240 lec s of chpt .    the hospitality of the department of physics and mathematical physics of the university of adelaide and the continuing financial support of the natural sciences and research engineering council of canada are gratefully acknowledged .",
