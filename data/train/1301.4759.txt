    "broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars are identified in rest - frame ultra violet spectra by broad absorption troughs displaced blueward from the corresponding emission lines , such as c@xmath2 and mg@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the blueward displacements , sometimes up to @xmath4 , are attributed to intervening outflows from active galactic nuclei  ( agns ) in our line of sight .",
    "the intrinsic percentage of quasars with bals is @xmath520% @xcite .",
    "two plausible explanations , an orientation scheme and an evolutionary scheme , were proposed and have been long debated .",
    "the orientation scheme proposes that the outflowing bal wind is preferentially equatorial @xcite and can be observed as absorption troughs only when the accretion disk is viewed nearly edge - on .",
    "the evolutionary scheme proposes that bal outflows are associated with a relatively short - lived ( possibly episodic ) evolutionary phase @xcite .",

    "several radio sources in bal quasars exhibit rapid radio variability that indicates unusually high brightness temperatures , which requires doppler beaming of nearly pole - on viewed jets , i.e. , accretion disks with small inclinations @xcite . a wide range of spectral indices , including flat spectra and steep spectra , is consistent with the wide range of orientations @xcite .",
    "although there is weak evidence that the spectral indices of bal quasars are steeper than those of non - bal quasars , which mildly favors edge - on orientations @xcite , a single edge - on geometry can not describe all bal quasars .",
    "@xcite suggested a picture in which bal quasars represent an early stage in the development of quasars on the basis of their compact radio morphology , observed in most cases .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that many radio - emitting bal quasars share several radio properties common to young radio sources , such as gigahertz - peaked spectrum  ( gps ) and compact steep spectrum  ( css ) sources .",
    "gps sources are compact ( @xmath6  kpc ) and show a convex radio spectrum that peaks between 500  mhz and 10  ghz ; css sources are larger ( @xmath720  kpc ) and have convex spectra that tend to peak at lower frequencies , typically @xmath8  mhz @xcite . on the basis of the rarity of fanaroff - riley class  ii radio galaxies in bal quasars and their observed anticorrelation between the balnicity index and radio loudness ,",
    "@xcite suggested a model in which a bal phase evolves into a radio - loud phase with a relatively short overlap . in this context , agn",
    "wind - induced feedback in the early stages of radio source evolution is discussed for the galaxy  black hole coevolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , @xcite reported that the fractions of gps candidates are similar in their bal and non - bal quasar samples , suggesting that bal quasars are generally not younger than non - bal quasars .",
    "thus , neither the orientation scheme nor the evolutionary scheme has been conclusively demonstrated to date on the basis of these inclination indicators and age estimators .",
    "very - long - baseline interferometry  ( vlbi ) with milliarcsecond  ( mas ) angular resolution provides exclusive and crucial opportunities for the investigation of the parsec  ( pc)-scale regions in which the phenomena that these inclination indicators and age estimators rely on are actually occuring .",
    "several vlbi observations have been reported for bal - quasar radio sources @xcite and revealed various signatures , such as blazar - like jets with a one - sided morphology , polarized radio emissions , a two - sided morphology suggesting inclined jets , css - like characteristics , and interactions between interstellar medium and jet .",
    "@xcite reported their systematic vlbi detection survey at 8.4  ghz for 22  radio - loud bal quasars using the optically connected array for vlbi exploration project  ( octave : @xcite ) .",
    "the samples of bright radio sources ( @xmath9  mjy  beam@xmath10 ) were selected by position matching between the bal quasar catalog of @xcite from the sloan digital sky survey third data release ( sdss  dr3 ; * ? ? ? * ) and faint images of the radio sky at twenty - cm ( first ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "most sources  ( 20/22 ) were detected with the octave baselines , suggesting brightness temperatures of greater than 10@xmath11  k , and the simultaneous coexistence of bal outflows and nonthermal jets .",

    "we also analyzed archival data from the vlba imaging and polarimetry survey  ( vips ; * ? ? ? * ) at 5  ghz and measured the deconvolved size to be 1.1  mas elongated at @xmath20  , which is consistent with the jvn result .",
    "the difference in flux density between ( simultaneous ) merlin and evn observations at 1.7  ghz was @xmath24  mjy , which was minor ( @xmath25% ) as compared to the total emission ( 193  mjy ) .",

    "the observational results confirmed a series of characteristics corresponding to a young radio source : ( 1 )  compact morphology , ( 2 )  a giga - hertz peaked spectrum , and ( 3 )  little variability ( * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the bal quasar j1020 + 4320 possesses a young radio source at its nucleus .",
    "the determined spectral peak frequency of 3.2  ghz in the observer frame is equivalent to a peak at 9.5  ghz in the rest frame at @xmath12 .",
    "the age estimator based on the observed correlation between the linear size and peak frequency of css and gps radio sources @xcite indicates that the radio source in j1020 + 4320 might be extremely young with an age of the order of @xmath1  years ( @xmath0  pc in size at a tentative expansion velocity of @xmath37 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the marginally deconvolved structure with an elongation of @xmath7  mas in the jvn 8.4-ghz and vips 5-ghz images ( section  [ section : result ] ) is suggestive of a mini radio galaxy of @xmath0  pc across . alternatively , the result of ssa spectral fitting suggests a source diameter of the order of @xmath0  pc ( with a magnetic field of @xmath38  g ) under the near equipartition condition between the energy densities of radiating electrons and magnetic field in a homogeneous , self - absorbed , incoherent synchrotron radio source with a power - law electron energy distribution .",
    "this linear size is also consistent with our vlbi images .",
    "thus , we can naturally understand the observed radio properties of j1020 + 4320 in terms of its compactness ( with a size of @xmath0  pc ) . to confirm that the radio source is actually young",
    ", further investigations might be essential for the determination of its kinematic age by , e.g. , measuring expected spectral changes on spectral property undergoing adiabatic expansion @xcite .      on the other hand , the data point at 408  mhz ( @xmath39  mjy with merlin ; @xcite )",
    "is significantly distant from our fitted model spectra .",
    "one more component is necessary to fit the low - frequency emission .",
    "it may originate in an optically thin component at large scales with a steep spectrum , which can also be inferred from the observed @xmath24  mjy at 1.7  ghz ( the merlin  evn differential flux density ) from the region of @xmath401.6  kpc ( section  [ section : result ] ) . the low - frequency component could be conceivably be explained as a relic of past jet activity ( * ? ? ?",

    ", the age of the gps component is @xmath1  years , while the low - frequency component may be relic of jets emanated @xmath41@xmath42  years ago ( assuming an expansion rate of @xmath43 ) .",
    "the coexistence of components with distinct ages indicates recurrent jet activity .",
    "the current stage of 3c  84 may be the closest example for the restarted jet activity in the recent 100  years in an existing radio galaxy @xcite ; the classical double - lobed radio galaxy 1245 + 676 also contains a gps component of an expanding compact double with a separation of 14  pc , suggesting a kinematic age of @xmath27  years @xcite .",
    "similarly , j1020 + 4320 may not be so young as a radio source but contains a very young radio component originating in the restarted jet activity .",
    "composite spectra with gps and mhz components have been found in a proportion of radio - loud bal quasar @xcite as well as j1020 + 4320 .",
    "the fact that the restarted jets are associated with bal features suggests relevance to the evolutionary scheme for the origin of bal quasars @xcite . in the evolutionary scheme , the bal fraction in the quasar population ( @xmath520%",
    "; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
