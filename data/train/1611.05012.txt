    "the us electric system is partitioned into balancing authority areas connected by tie lines .",
    "the interactions among different balancing authorities are carried out through interchange scheduling . since each balancing authority area , in general , has more than one neighbors , the operator has to specify how much power should flow across each separate scheduling interface .",
    "the scheduling of tie line flows is critical to the overall system performance and market efficiency given the fact that the interchange amounts to a significant fraction of net energy .",
    "for example , the net flow over external ties accounts for 16.5% of the net energy for load in iso new england in 2015@xcite .    in the current external transaction system , operators use two sets of market - based offers to determine external interface schedules : ( 1 ) market participants external transaction offers to buy and sell across an interface , cleared against ( 2 ) the real - time generation supply curves in each control area .",
    "inter - regional energy trades are driven by the interface price differentials , facilitated by market participants and administrated by operators .",
    "intuitively , operators can use external tie lines to enhance market efficiencies and operational benefit by transferring excess power from low cost to high cost areas . in practice , however , the state of the art scheduling techniques are not efficient with two common symptoms : ( 1 ) the under utilization of tie lines in transporting power from low cost to high cost areas , and ( 2 ) the presence of counter - intuitive flows from high cost to low cost areas .",
    "the economic loss from inefficient interchange schedules is substantial , estimated at the level of $ 784 million for the new york and new england customers from 2006 to 2010 @xcite .",
    "one of the main causes of inefficient interchange scheduling is the latency between scheduling time and physical delivery .",
    "since market participants submit bids and offers for the external transactions at least 75 minutes in advance , the information used for interchange scheduling may not reflect the actual system conditions at the time of physical delivery . with the increasing level of renewable integration , this situation is likely to be exacerbated .",
    "techniques aimed at improving interchange efficiency can be classified into two categories .",
    "the first aims to optimize the overall interconnected system in a decentralized fashion .",
    "in particular , the optimal interchange schedules are obtained from the multi - area optimal power flow ( opf ) problem @xcite . among existing prior work",
    ", the authors of @xcite consider the multi - area economic dispatch under wind uncertainty . in @xcite ,",
    "a two - stage stochastic market clearing model is formulated for the multi - area energy and reserve dispatch problem whose solution is obtained based on scenario enumerations . in @xcite ,",
    "the day - ahead tie - flow scheduling is formulated as a two - stage adaptive robust optimization minimizing the cost of the worst - case wind production . in @xcite , an adjustable interval robust scheduling of wind power for day - ahead multi - area energy and reserve market clearing",
    "is proposed .",
    "the uncertainty of wind farms is represented by predefined intervals and the clearing model is formulated as a mixed integer quadratic programming problem . for deterministic multi - area economic dispatch approaches , see @xcite and reference therein .",
    "the main issue of this category approach is the elimination of arbitrage opportunities for the external market participants .",
    "since operators can not trade with each other directly , market participants facilitate trades between control areas .",
    "the multi - area economic dispatch approach thus can not be implemented under the current regulation .",
    "the second category includes the current industrial practices based on the so - called proxy bus approximation @xcite .",
    "the proxy bus is a trading location at which market participants can buy and sell electricity . in @xcite ,",
    "a coordinated interchange scheduling scheme is proposed for the co - optimization of energy and ancillary services .",
    "the proposal of coordinated transaction scheduling ( cts ) in @xcite is a state - of - the - art scheduling technique based on the economic argument using supply and demand functions exchanged by the neighboring operators .",
    "when there is only a single interface in a two - area system , such functions can be succinctly characterized , and the exchange is only made once ; the need of iterations among operators is eliminated . built upon the idea of cts , a stochastic cts for the two - area single - interface scheduling problem is proposed in @xcite .",
    "a shortcoming of existing techniques based on proxy bus approximations is the difficulty of generalizing it for multi - area interconnected systems where multiple scheduling interfaces have to be optimized simultaneously .",
    "the challenge arises from the fact that the interfaces can not be succinctly characterized by a pair of expected demand and supply functions  an essential property underlying the approach in @xcite for the single interface scheduling . when multiple interfaces are involved , the simple idea of equating expected demand and supply functions is not applicable and there is no simple notion that the intersection of demand and supply curves gives the social welfare optimizing interchange .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we generalize the single interface scheduling problem to the case involving a network of operating areas , each having multiple interfaces with its neighbors .",
    "we consider two types of interface scheduling : ( i ) the synchronous scheduling and ( ii ) the asynchronous scheduling .",
    "the former requires all areas operated under the same scheduling clock whereas the latter allows every pair of operating areas setting their interfaces independently of others . to our best knowledge",
    ", there is no existing results on this problem in the open literature .",
    "second , we present a new scheduling technique based on the classical idea of coordinate descent method . the main idea is to iterate over all interfaces , one at a time , minimizing the overall system cost under uncertainty . in each iteration , a single interface optimization problem is solved by projecting the current solution to a particular coordinate representing a particular interface flow .",
    "the optimality and convergence are guaranteed under nominal assumptions for both synchronous and asynchronous algorithms .",
    "a proxy bus is a physical or virtual location where market participants can trade energy between areas . for interchange scheduling ,",
    "a proxy bus is the location to which generation in the neighboring area is _ assumed _ be dispatched up and down in response to the change of interchange schedule . in this paper , we focus on the multi - proxy bus system where more than one proxy buses are used to represent the transmission network of the adjacent systems .",
    "we use an example to illustrate the multi - proxy bus system . fig .",
    "[ fig : multiproxy ] depicts a multi - proxy bus representation for a 3-area 2-interface interconnected system where each square box indicates a proxy bus .",
    "the interchange vector @xmath7 consists of two interface flows , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with fixed directions indicated by the arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : multiproxy ] .",
    "area @xmath0 maintains a regional interchange vector @xmath14 that describes its own interface flows . for convenience ,",
    "we assume the direction of each interface flow in the regional interchange vector being _ outbound_. in this example , the interchange vector for area 1 is @xmath15 , area 2 @xmath16 and area 3 @xmath17 .",
    "the interchange scheduling problem is to optimize the interchange vector @xmath7 for which the expected overall operation cost is minimized _ under the proxy bus model_. this should be distinguished with the problem of multi - area economic dispatch in which the optimal tie line flows and regional generation dispatch are optimized _ without network approximation_.",
    "in this section , we consider the single interface scheduling between area 1 and area 2 .",
    "if the two areas are also physically connected with other areas , we assume that the tie line flows on those areas are fixed , thus not part of the decision process .",
    "the single interface scheduling is a two - stage stochastic optimization : the first stage optimizes the interface flow @xmath18 from area 1 to area 2 as in ( [ opt : s1 ] ) ; the second stage dispatches internal resources @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the least cost manner to balance the interchange @xmath18 and internal net loads @xmath21 and @xmath22 as in ( [ opt : d3]-[opt : d4 ] ) .",

    "the lmp @xmath33 at proxy bus in area @xmath0 is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the lagrangian multipliers associated with @xmath37 given @xmath18 and @xmath8 for area @xmath0 , @xmath30 .",
    "in general , the two - stage stochastic problem is intractable using standard optimization techniques when @xmath21 and @xmath22 follow continuous distributions .",
    "fortunately , for this particular problem ( [ opt : s1]-[opt : d4 ] ) , there is an indirect approach developed in @xcite by solving the following stochastic social welfare maximization problem :    @xmath38dx\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 $ ] is the expected lmp  a function of the net interchange @xmath18at the proxy bus of area @xmath0 , @xmath30 .",
    "the solution of the single interface stochastic optimization problem is given in the following theorem :    [ thm : equivalence ] if ( [ opt : d3 ] ) and ( [ opt : d4 ] ) are not degenerate for all @xmath21 and @xmath22 , then problems ( [ opt : s1 ] ) and ( [ opt : s2 ] ) have the same optimizer @xmath40 satisfying @xmath41 if @xmath42 and @xmath26 otherwise .",
    "theorem [ thm : equivalence ] generalizes the tie optimization solution in @xcite to the stochastic setting .",
    "its significance lies in that the optimal interchange is the intersection of expected demand and supply functions rather than the expectation of the intersections of demand and supply curves or the intersection of demand and supply functions using expected generations and demands .    in the following ,",
    "we generalize the single interface scheduling algorithm to the multi - area system setting where multiple interface flows are involved .",
    "in particular , the proposed interface - by - interface scheduling ( ibis ) algorithm is specialized for the synchronous scenario in section [ sec : syn ] and the asynchronous scenario in section [ sec : asyn ] .",

    "i.e. _ , all interface flows are optimized simultaneously at each scheduling time .",
    "consider an interconnected system with @xmath43 independently operated areas ( of an arbitrary network topology ) and @xmath44 separate scheduling interfaces .",
    "the multi - area synchronous interchange scheduling problem , analogous to the single interface scheduling problem , is also a two - stage stochastic optimization : the first stage is to set the values of all interface flows by minimizing the expected overall cost ; the second stage is to minimize the cost of individual areas given the fixed interchange and realized random generation and demand .    as a generalization of ( [ opt : s1 ] ) for the single interface scheduling problem , the first stage optimization for the multi - area system is given by @xmath45\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is a real vector in dimension @xmath44 , @xmath46 is the expected overall system cost , and @xmath47 is the optimal regional dispatch in area @xmath0 , given the interchange level @xmath14 over the interfaces associated with area @xmath0 and the realized net load @xmath8 .    in the second stage",
