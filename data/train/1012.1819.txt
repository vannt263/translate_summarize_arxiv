    "for example , the diagram of the partition @xmath28 is    @xmath29    the cell in the @xmath26-th row and @xmath30-th column is referenced by its _ coordinate _ @xmath31 .",

    "this bijection is intimately related to the representation theory of the symmetric group @xcite , the theory of symmetric functions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 ) , and the theory of partitions @xcite .",
    "the bijection can be defined through a _ row - insertion _ algorithm first defined by schensted @xcite in order to study the longest increasing subsequence of a permutation .",

    "it is natural to investigate various aspects of it .",
    "thus fomin s appendix in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 ) starts with the following two motivating questions :    1 .   given a partition @xmath5 ,",

    "2 .   given a tableau @xmath62 ,",
    "characterize the permutations @xmath3 which have @xmath62 as their insertion tableau .",
    "we consider an _ approximate _ version of such questions and ask to what extent @xmath5 changes as @xmath3 changes slightly .",
    "question ( 1 ) is answered by the following theorem of greene .",
    "[ thm : greene]let @xmath3 be a permutation , and suppose that the largest cardinality of the union of @xmath30 increasing subsequences in @xmath3 is @xmath70 , then @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 for all @xmath74 .    in his study of the rsk correspondence , knuth discovered certain equivalence relations that are key to the solution of question ( 2 ) above .",
    "two permutations are _ knuth equivalent _ if one can be obtained from the other by certain restricted sequences of adjacent transpositions .",
    "knuth equivalent permutations are the equivalency classes of permutations that have the same insertion tableau . for more on the subject ,",
    "see  @xcite .    in order to make our question concrete",
    ", we need to specify two measures of distance : one between permutations and the other between diagrams .",
    "a natural metric on permutations is _ left - multiplication _ by adjacent transpositions .",
    "an _ adjacent transposition _ is a permutation of the form @xmath75 .",
    "left - multiplying @xmath3 by an adjacent transposition is denoted by @xmath76 and means that first , the permutation @xmath3 is applied and then the transposition .",
    "we denote the least number of adjacent transpositions that transform the permutation @xmath3 to @xmath77 by @xmath78 . recall that @xmath79 is the graph metric in the cayley graph of @xmath41 w.r.t .",
    "the generating set of adjacent transpositions @xmath80 .",
    "we will say that two permutations @xmath3 and @xmath77 are _ at distance @xmath4 _ if @xmath81 .",
    "if @xmath5 and @xmath82 are two diagrams , define their distance to be @xmath83 let @xmath3 and @xmath77 be any two permutations .",
    "we are interested in the lipschitz constant of this mapping , i.e. , @xmath84 where the maximum is over all @xmath85 with @xmath81 .",
    "the choice of left - multiplication above is in fact without loss of generality . by proposition [ prop : inverse_rsk ]",
    "the shape of a permutation and its inverse under the rsk correspondence are the same .",
    "our results thus all follow immediately for right - multiplication since @xmath86 is equivalent to @xmath87 .    in general",
    ", although @xmath88 and @xmath89 are natural metrics to study for permutations and diagrams respectively , the same question can be asked for other metrics .",
    "we discuss the extension of our results to other metrics on permutations in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we will show upper bounds on the lipschitz constant when the number of transpositions @xmath6 .",
    "we also give a construction of a family of permutations which achieve this bound asymptotically .",
    "the first step of the proof is to show that left - multiplying a permutation by a transposition can result in only a bounded number of cells being different in each row of the diagram .",
    "let @xmath90 and let @xmath91 be the respective diagrams .",
    "suppose that @xmath86 , and @xmath92 .",
    "then , @xmath93 [ prop : running - sum - t1 ]    suppose that the largest cardinality of the union of @xmath30 increasing subsequences in @xmath3 is @xmath94 .",
    "suppose there is a subsequence which includes the pair that is being transposed in @xmath3 . by deleting one of the elements of the pair we obtain a set of @xmath30 increasing subsequences of @xmath77",
    "whose cardinality is at least @xmath95 .",
    "if there is no such subsequence , then the same @xmath30 subsequences are also increasing in @xmath77 . by greene s theorem [ thm :",
    "greene ] this implies @xmath96    for the lower bound , consider the largest cardinality of the union of @xmath30 increasing sequences in @xmath77 .",
    "no subsequence in this union can contain both of the elements involved in the transposition . since the pair involved in the transposition have no other elements between them in both @xmath3 and @xmath77 the subsequences are also increasing in @xmath3 .",
    "we conclude in the same way that @xmath97    figure [ fig : tableaux - t1 ] will be useful in the following discussion .",
    "it depicts the union of two diagrams @xmath5 and @xmath82 , which is also a young diagram .",
    "the symmetric difference consists of the cells marked by a dot .",
    "the remaining set of cells of the diagram labeled @xmath98 is the intersection of @xmath5 and @xmath82 and this is a young diagram as well .",
    "[ cor : one - cell - different ] let @xmath85 where @xmath99 and let @xmath100 be the corresponding diagrams . then at most one cell in each row and each column of the union of @xmath5 and @xmath82 can be in the symmetric difference .    to see this for a row @xmath101 , consider inequality for @xmath102 and for @xmath103 and take their difference . a similar argument applied to the reversed permutations implies the claim for columns .",
    "( see proposition  [ prop : reverse_conjugate ] ) .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath77 be permutations in @xmath104 with respective young diagrams @xmath5 and @xmath82 , and suppose that @xmath99",
    ". then @xmath105 [ thm : upperbound - t=1 ]    as shown in figure [ fig : tableaux - t1 ] , let @xmath31 and @xmath106 be the coordinates of two distinct cells in the symmetric difference . by corollary [ cor : one - cell - different ] , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "this gives a 1:1 map from unordered pairs of cells in the symmetric difference into @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , @xmath110 implying the required bound @xmath111      in this section we construct pairs of permutations in @xmath41 which differ by a single transposition whose corresponding young diagrams differ by at least @xmath17 cells , matching the upper bound in theorem [ thm : upperbound - easy ] asymptotically .",

    "[ lem : decreasing - witness]let @xmath0 be a permutation whose elements can be decomposed in the following two ways : ( i ) into increasing subsequences of cardinalities @xmath112 , and ( ii ) into decreasing subsequences of cardinalities @xmath113 , where the partitions @xmath5 and @xmath33 are conjugate . then @xmath1 .    by greene s theorem [ thm : greene ]",
    "it suffices to show that for each @xmath101 , the largest cardinality of the union of @xmath101 increasing sequences in @xmath3 is @xmath114 . by assumption",
    "we know it is at least this number and we need to show the opposite inequality .",
    "namely , that if @xmath115 is a collection of disjoint increasing sequences in @xmath3 , @xmath116 .    by assumption , there is a decomposition @xmath117 of @xmath3 into disjoint decreasing subsequences of cardinalities @xmath113 . but",
    "each @xmath118 and @xmath119 can have at most one element in common , so that @xmath120 where the last equality follows because the partitions @xmath112 and @xmath113 are conjugate .",

    "namely for @xmath122 with @xmath123 an odd integer , we will construct two permutations @xmath3 and @xmath77 of shapes @xmath124 and @xmath125 which differ by exactly one cell in each row and column , giving @xmath126 .",
    "thus it can be verified that together with theorem  [ thm : upperbound - t=1 ] this gives a complete answer to our question for @xmath2 of this form .",
    "for other values of @xmath2 we get the result by padding this basic construction . in the discussion that follows we decompose these permutations into monotone subsequences .",
    "the decompositions we exhibit are not necessarily unique , but for our purpose any decomposition suffices .",
    "the construction can , perhaps , be best understood by observing alongside with the general discussion a concrete special case .",
    "so we intersperse our general constructions with an illustration that shows how things work for @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) .",

    "both @xmath118 and @xmath135 have cardinality @xmath136 .",
    "@xmath137    the permutation @xmath3 is constructed by spreading out the intermediate elements with @xmath138 and @xmath139 remaining fixed points ( see below ) .",
    "the blocks of big elements are then inserted in the order @xmath140 in the spaces between the smaller intermediate elements while the blocks of small elements are inserted in the order @xmath141 in the spaces between the larger intermediate elements . to obtain @xmath77",
    "we apply the transposition @xmath142 to @xmath3 .",
    "the permutations are defined in this manner with a view to decomposing them into increasing and decreasing sequences of desired cardinalities .",
    "@xmath143    from the construction we claim that @xmath3 and @xmath77 can be decomposed into a disjoint union of increasing subsequences of cardinalities @xmath144 and @xmath145 respectively . for @xmath3 the increasing sequences consist of ( i ) the intermediate elements , which in our example is @xmath146 , ( ii ) the blocks of small elements , i.e. , @xmath147 and @xmath148 and ( iii ) the blocks of big elements , i.e. , @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "the permutation @xmath77 can be decomposed into the increasing subsequences of the following three types : ( i ) an intermediate element and the block of big elements following it , which in the example are @xmath151 and @xmath152 , ( ii ) a block of small elements and the following intermediate element , i.e. , @xmath153 and @xmath154 and ( iii ) the two subsequences of length one consisting of one of the two middle intermediate elements , i.e. @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "the proof that @xmath3 and @xmath77 have the shapes @xmath124 and @xmath125 respectively uses lemma [ lem : decreasing - witness ] .",
    "it is enough to decompose @xmath3 and @xmath77 into a union of decreasing sequences whose cardinalities are given by the respective conjugate sequences .",
    "note that as it happens , the shapes @xmath5 and @xmath82 are conjugates .",
    "we assign the elements of @xmath3 to decreasing subsequences @xmath157 of cardinalities @xmath158 . as follows .",
    "since the @xmath159 are subsequences , elements in them appear in the same order as in the permutation . secondly , the assignment is made so that each subsequence has exactly one of the intermediate elements , and it appears after any of the big elements and before any of the small elements .",
    "( there is more than one way to do this . )",
    "we first see how this is done in the example .",
    "we first construct @xmath160 and @xmath161 which are both decreasing sequences of length @xmath162 .",
    "the largest elements in the blocks @xmath135 , the largest elements in the blocks @xmath118 and one of the middle intermediate elements are assigned to @xmath160 .",
    "then we choose @xmath161 similarly from among the remaining elements .",
    "@xmath163    the remaining elements can be seen to have the same structure recursively ( the remaining elements appear in the same relative order as would the elements of the permutation for @xmath164 ) , where the brackets indicate blocks of big and small elements as before . @xmath165 to assign elements to @xmath166 and @xmath167 , we want to continue with the strategy of choosing the largest elements that remain in the blocks . note that since the big elements 13 and 14 have been assigned , there are no big elements that follow the element 8 , and it now becomes `` available '' .",
    "thus @xmath166 and @xmath167 are constructed by assigning the largest elements that remain in the small and big blocks and one of the remaining intermediate elements in the middle of the blocks . @xmath168",

    "instead , note that when only one element remains in a block of small elements , the intermediate element which follows that block has not yet been assigned and it does not follow any other small elements . thus the strategy for @xmath185 is to assign to it the largest elements from all blocks except from @xmath189 in which only one element remains , and to assign the intermediate element following @xmath189 to @xmath185 . to construct @xmath186 ,",
