    "according to an analysis made by the e791 collaboration at fermilab  @xcite , almost the @xmath5 of the @xmath6 decay rate could resonate on a scalar bump ( @xmath7 ) with mass @xmath8  mev and width @xmath9  mev .",
    "it is matter of discussion to assess : 1 )  if this state corresponds to a real resonance or if it is merely due to strong final state interactions of @xmath10 s , 2 )  if it is related to the pole on the second riemann sheet of the isoscalar @xmath11-wave @xmath12 scattering discussed , e.g. , in  @xcite . in this note",
    "i will avoid further comments on the nature of the @xmath7 , assuming the pragmatic point of view that the e791 analysis indicates the presence of a state ( or an effect ) in hadronic @xmath13 decays which could have some role also in @xmath14 decays . in the study carried out by e791 , the @xmath7 is parameterized as a breit - wigner resonance ; this assumption certainly conflicts with the broadness of the resonance one wants to describe , but probably it is reasonable enough to try rough estimates of the relevance of @xmath7 in heavy meson decays .",
    "this attitude is assumed in  @xcite where a model for heavy meson decays ,  @xcite , it is used to compute the @xmath15 decay rate , tuning the model parameters to fit the e791 results . in such a way ,",
    "since the model incorporates properly the spin - flavor symmetries of hqet , one has at hand a tool to compute also the @xmath16 rate .",
    "why bother with such an exercise ?",
    "cleo , babar and belle  @xcite measure the ratio of branching ratios : @xmath17 finding : @xmath18 interestingly , tree level theoretical calculations assuming the factorization approximation in the bsw version  @xcite find a value of @xmath19 and the inclusion of penguin contributions does not help much in improving this result . in some other models , like the one in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath20 can be as large as @xmath21 .",
    "a calculation including penguins in the factorization approximation was performed in  @xcite and found @xmath22 .    in the experimental measurements leading to @xmath20 , the @xmath1",
    "is reconstructed by cutting the invariant mass @xmath23 around the value of @xmath24  mev with a window @xmath25  mev .",
    "a broad scalar bump like the @xmath7 , decaying @xmath26 in two pions , is a good candidate to be an important background under the @xmath1 .",
    "the question here is : can the inclusion of such a background improve the agreement of the theoretical computation of @xmath20 with data ?",
    "to understand if the numbers could go in the right direction , consider the bsw effective hamiltonian for @xmath27 : @xmath28 where the @xmath29 term takes care of the charged @xmath14 decay while the @xmath30 term accounts for the neutral @xmath14 decay ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "to    the coefficients @xmath31 are different combination of the wilson coefficients fitted for @xmath14 decays , and it turns out that @xmath29 is almost seven times larger than @xmath30",
    ". therefore the inclusion of the @xmath27 amplitude as a background in the @xmath32 decay changes more effectively the denominator of @xmath20 rather than the numerator . anyway , a quantitative estimate of the effect requires the computation of a hadronic form factor .",
    "the model used for this purpose is a constituent quark model based on a nambu - jona - lasinio lagrangian whose bosonization generates effective vertices of the kind meson@xmath33  @xcite ( @xmath34 heavy quark , @xmath35 light quark ) .",
    "a decay amplitude in this model is described by a loop diagram with quark internal lines and meson external legs . in our case",
    ", the computation of the hadronic form factor in the @xmath36 amplitude requires to introduce as a parameter the coupling @xmath37 of @xmath7 to the light quark component of @xmath13 .",
    "this parameter can be fitted on e791 data .",
    "the same coupling enters in the computation of @xmath27 .",
    "we can estimate @xmath37 by comparing the hadronic form factors @xmath38 with @xmath39 obtained using the e791 parameterization : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the decay width of @xmath7 in @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the klln triangular function defining the two body phase space , @xmath44 is the breit - wigner shape ( with co - moving width  @xcite ) . the comparison @xmath38 vs. @xmath39 for the @xmath6 process gives an estimate for @xmath45 which can be used to perform the calculation of @xmath46 involved in the @xmath47 process .",
    "the hadronic form factor is defined by the matrix element : @xmath48f_0^{(h\\sigma)}(q^2)+\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left[(p+q_\\sigma)^\\mu-\\frac{m_h^2-m_\\sigma^2}{q^2}q^\\mu\\right ] f_1^{(h\\sigma)}(q^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 stands for heavy meson @xmath50 . using the value obtained for @xmath46 in : @xmath51",
    "we obtain a determination of the background amplitudes to be included in the computation of @xmath20 .",
    "after this is done , we find @xmath52 .    the calculation of the @xmath20 ratio including the @xmath7 background has been performed in a completely different ( and more refined ) way  @xcite avoiding the breit - wigner approximation ( by using a suitable scalar form factor of the pion ) and considering the @xmath7 as the effect of strong final state pion interactions .",
    "the approach there used is chiral perturbation theory inspired . in this context",
    "it is found again that the impact of @xmath7 on the @xmath20 ratio is remarkably huge , and it turns out to be @xmath53 depending on whether a @xmath54 window of @xmath55 or @xmath56  mev is assumed ( i.e. depending on how much of the @xmath7 tail is taken under the @xmath1 , having in mind the picture of a @xmath7 bw - resonance ) .",
    "another possible background under the @xmath1 could be due to @xmath57 , because the @xmath58 coupling is large . this has been investigated in  @xcite and again in  @xcite with different conclusions about its relevance .",
    "one of the methods for extracting the ckm angle @xmath3 from data is the isospin analysis of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a @xmath7 background under the @xmath1 would inevitably complicate the theoretical analysis as long as the @xmath7 contribution is not clearly isolated experimentally .    to    for sure @xmath7 and @xmath1 have quite different structures on the dalitz plot ( see fig . 2 obtained in  @xcite ) .",
    "this means that in principle one can clearly discriminate the @xmath7 contribution experimentally .",
    "the problem is whether the experimental sensitivity can reach the required level to test the possibility of the presence of a @xmath7 in the dalitz plot @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "even a relatively modest @xmath7 contribution ( difficult to disentangle experimentally ) of @xmath59 in @xmath60 would be sufficient to spoil the isospin analysis of @xmath61 . in  @xcite it is shown how to enlarge the @xmath62 analysis to include the @xmath63 channel ( this is possible because the @xmath63 channel has definite properties under cp ) .",
    "the presence of this background implies that we gain more hadronic parameters but also more observables in such a way that a dalitz plot analysis is still theoretically viable  @xcite .",
    "therefore one can conclude that if the cuts on the @xmath12 invariant mass and on the helicity angle @xmath64 are not sufficient to suppress the @xmath7 in the @xmath62 phase space , one is forced to consider a more refined isospin analysis for the ckm @xmath3 extraction . only more data on @xmath14 decays will help in deciding if this is indeed the case .",
    "a shadow on both the analyses  @xcite and  @xcite is that no one of them makes use of the improved factorization method  @xcite ; a critical comparison with its predictions is in order  @xcite .",
    "moreover the role of @xmath7 in @xmath13 decays is being critically reexamined by the focus collaboration following an approach quite different from the one adopted by e791  @xcite .",
    "i have briefly reviewed the potential role of @xmath7 in @xmath50 decays referring to two distinct theoretical calculations  @xcite of the @xmath63 background hidden under @xmath62 in @xmath65 decays . even if the two computations stem from very different assumptions and calculation methods , both point to an important impact of the @xmath7 in @xmath66 decay .",
    "this turns out to be helpful in understanding the experimental numbers in eq .",
    "( [ eq : esperimenti ] ) .",
    "the complication of a @xmath7 background under the @xmath1 in @xmath61 decays rises the question on how one should take it into account in the extraction of the @xmath3 angle using the isospin analysis of  @xcite .",
    "the data available up to now have not yet reached the level of sensitivity to assess if such a background would be clearly experimentally discriminated .",
