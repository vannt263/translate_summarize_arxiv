    "recently high resolution inelastic neutron scattering studies of the spin - wave spectrum have been carried out in the square - lattice spin-1/2 antiferromagnet @xmath0.@xcite spin - wave energies were obtained along high symmetry directions in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) brillouin zone . with wavevectors identified by their coordinates",
    "@xmath2 in the 2d reciprocal space of the square lattice , these studies reveal a noticeable spin - wave dispersion along the af zone boundary , with a maximum of 335 mev near the point x having @xmath3 and a minimum of 285 mev near @xmath4 at @xmath5 k.    the spin - wave spectrum for the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet ( qhaf ) with only nearest - neighbour ( nn ) exchange coupling @xmath6 , conventionally obtained using the linear spin - wave theory , shows no dispersion along the af zone boundary .",
    "the simplest explanation for the observed spin - wave dispersion involves a next - nearest - neighbour ( nnn ) _ ferromagnetic _ exchange coupling @xmath7 between cu spins , and best fit was found with @xmath8 mev and @xmath9 mev at @xmath5 k.@xcite    it was pointed out@xcite that a more natural explanation of the data can be obtained in terms of the one - band hubbard model , for which the strong coupling expansion in powers of the nn hopping term @xmath10 up to fourth order o(@xmath11 ) yields an effective spin hamiltonian with _",
    "antiferromagnetic _ exchange interactions between nn , nnn , and nnnn pairs of spins , as well as a cyclic ring exchange interaction coupling four spins at the corners of a square plaquette.@xcite the quantitative description within linear spin - wave theory of both the spin - wave energies and intensities was taken as a strong demonstration that the one - band hubbard model is an excellent starting point for describing the magnetic interactions in cuprates .",
    "fits were found to be indistinguishable from those for variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and yielded @xmath12 ev and @xmath13 ev at @xmath5 k , so that the characteristic ratio @xmath14 .",
    "recently , excellent fit has also been obtained with the spin - wave energy for the square - lattice hubbard model , evaluated numerically in the random phase approximation ( rpa).@xcite    the one - band hubbard model with only nn hopping possesses particle - hole symmetry , implying identical behaviour for hole and electron doping .",
    "however , there exist significant differences in the magnetic properties of hole - doped and electron - doped cuprates .",
    "in particular , af order persists in the electron - doped cuprate @xmath15 up to a doping concentration of about 15%,@xcite whereas only 2% hole concentration destroys af order in @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the hubbard model with only nn hopping is unable to describe the magnetic properties of doped cuprates .",
    "recently , the magnetic phase diagram of the @xmath1 hubbard model has been obtained in the @xmath17 space,@xcite for electron and hole doping and both signs of the nnn hopping term @xmath18 .",
    "the phase diagram shows that for an appropriate sign of @xmath18 , the af state survives electron doping ( up to @xmath19 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) , whereas for any finite hole doping the af state is destroyed .",
    "thus the @xmath1 hubbard model appears to be the simplest correlated electron model capable of describing the magnetic correlations in cuprates , even at the doped level .",
    "the need for more realistic microscopic models , which include nnn hopping etc .",
    ", has also been acknowledged recently from band structure studies , photoemission data and neutron - scattering measurements of high - t@xmath22 and related materials.@xcite estimates for @xmath23 range from 0.15 to 0.5 .",
    "now , the nnn hopping term @xmath18 generates antiferromagnetic nnn interaction of comparable magnitude ( @xmath24 is of the order of @xmath25 ) .",
    "the resulting competition between the exchange interactions will modify the values of @xmath10 and @xmath26 obtained earlier.@xcite in this brief report we obtain the modified one - band hubbard model parameters by fitting the spin - wave spectrum for @xmath0 with that for the @xmath1 hubbard model .",
    "we have used the rpa approach to directly obtain the spin - wave propagator in the af state of the @xmath1 hubbard model .",
    "this approach has the advantage of being applicable in the intermediate- and weak - coupling regimes as well , as it eliminates the need for going through the strong coupling expansion to obtain the effective spin model .",
    "finite-@xmath26 effects of double occupancy on the spin - wave dispersion in the half - filled hubbard model on a square lattice have been studied earlier at the rpa level , both analytically by systematically expanding in powers of @xmath27,@xcite and also numerically through an exact computation.@xcite this latter approach , desirable in view of the slow , asymptotic convergence of the @xmath27 expansion , was employed to study the spin - wave properties in the weak coupling limit , where it was found that the spin - wave energy scale gets compressed by the decreasing charge gap .    in ref .",
    "[ 13 ] , the spin - wave propagator at the rpa level , @xmath28 , was obtained by keeping all terms up to o(@xmath29 ) ( and some terms even up to o(@xmath30 ) ) in the zeroth - order particle - hole propagator @xmath31 .",
    "the terms causing spin - wave dispersion along the af zone boundary are of order @xmath32 , showing the importance of charge fluctuations , as the double occupancy term @xmath33 is of the same order .",
    "this rpa approach is isomorphous to the linear spin - wave analysis@xcite of the effective spin-1/2 heisenberg model obtained from the strong - coupling expansion up to order @xmath11 , where the higher order exchange terms arise from the coherent motion of electrons beyond the nn sites.@xcite",
    "including the contribution in @xmath31 of the nnn hopping term @xmath18 up to the leading order ( @xmath34 ) only,@xcite and neglecting terms of order @xmath35 , and @xmath36 which are an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath29 , we obtain the spin - wave propagator @xmath37   \\times \\frac{2j}{\\omega_{\\bf q } } \\left ( \\frac{1}{\\omega-\\omega_{\\bf q } } -   \\frac{1}{\\omega+\\omega_{\\bf q } } \\right ) \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the spin - wave energy @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the hf - level sublattice magnetization . here",

    "( 2 ) for the spin - wave energy , the double - occupancy term of order @xmath32 and the competing - interaction term of order @xmath24 are of similar magnitude .",
    "while both terms remove the degeneracy in the spin - wave spectrum along the af zone boundary @xmath48 , they give rise to _ opposite _ dispersion along the af zone boundary .",
    "thus , while double occupancy leads to maximum and minimum spin - wave energies at points @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively , the competing interaction favors an exactly opposite trend .        from eq .",
    "( 2 ) , the spin - wave velocity @xmath51 , and the spin - wave energies at points @xmath52 and @xmath53 are obtained as : @xmath54 a momentum - independent multiplicative renormalization factor @xmath55 , arising from quantum spin fluctuations,@xcite has been included .",
    "equations ( 4 - 6 ) clearly show that for @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( as appropriate for the cuprates ) , the double occupancy and competing interaction terms are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "it is also interesting to note that @xmath58 and @xmath59 are directly proportional to each other .",
    "indeed , the spin - wave spectrum for @xmath0 shows that both @xmath58 and @xmath59 are nearly unchanged with temperature.@xcite interestingly , from eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 6 ) we find that @xmath58 and @xmath59 have a vanishing derivative with respect to @xmath27 ( which should change with temperature ) at @xmath60 , which is very close to the @xmath61 value obtained from our fit .    as the maximum in the spin - wave energy spectrum of @xmath0 is clearly seen to occur at @xmath52 , the double occupancy term is actually dominant , showing the importance of charge fluctuations in cuprates . from this information ,",
    "an upper limit for the ratio @xmath23 can be deduced by comparing the spin - wave energies @xmath62 and @xmath59 . from eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , we obtain the condition @xmath63 , which is shown in fig .",
    "1 . for @xmath56 , the ratio @xmath23 must be smaller than @xmath64 .    taking the key values of the maximum spin - wave energy @xmath62 and the spin - wave velocity @xmath58 from the spin - wave spectrum , we solve for @xmath27 and @xmath6 from eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , and thus obtain @xmath10 and @xmath26 . with @xmath65 mev and @xmath66 mev at @xmath5 k , and taking @xmath67 , we obtain @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 ev , and @xmath71 ev . figure 2 shows the spin - wave spectrum calculated from eq .",
    "( 2 ) with these @xmath10 and @xmath26 values , and the experimental points for @xmath0 at 10 k. without @xmath18 , the corresponding values are @xmath72 , @xmath14 , @xmath73 ev , and @xmath74 ev in agreement with the results of ref .",
    "[ 1 ] , and showing a nearly @xmath75 enhancement in the double occupancy factor @xmath32 due to the competing effect of @xmath18 . with @xmath76 mev and @xmath66 mev at @xmath77 k , we obtain @xmath78 , @xmath70 ev , and @xmath79 ev .    in the approach adopted in ref . [ 1 ] , the effective spin @xmath80 quantum heisenberg hamiltonian obtained by the strong - coupling expansion of the hubbard model contains all physical processes up to the order @xmath11 level , and the subsequent use of the linear spin - wave approximation to obtain the spin - wave spectrum neglects the quantum corrections of order @xmath81 . in our approach",
    "these two steps are carried out in exactly reverse order .",
    "the evaluation of the spin - wave propagator in the random phase approximation neglects the quantum corrections ( of equivalent order @xmath82 within the inverse - degeneracy expansion of the generalized @xmath83-orbital hubbard model)@xcite .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath31 is next carried out , either analytically via a systematic expansion in powers of @xmath27 , or numerically through an exact computation .    the spin - wave dispersion along the af zone boundary , caused by the double occupancy effect at finite @xmath26 and partially neutralized by the competing interaction effect of @xmath18 , results in a broadening of the spin - wave spectrum at the high - energy end , resembling a spin - wave damping effect .",
    "implication of this broadening to the two - magnon raman scattering in @xmath0@xcite has been discussed earlier.@xcite the importance of charge fluctuation effects ( in terms of the cyclic exchange terms ) have also been pointed out in infrared absorption experiments,@xcite and magnetic properties of the related compound @xmath84.@xcite    in conclusion , the competing interaction effect of the nnn hopping term @xmath18 , which renders the hubbard model more realistic for describing the magnetic properties of the doped cuprates , partially neutralizes the spin - wave dispersion along the af zone boundary caused by the double occupancy effect . due to this competition",
    "the double occupancy factor @xmath32 must be significantly enhanced by nearly @xmath75 in order to fit the observed spin - wave spectrum in @xmath0 ."
