    "the @xmath0 random field ising model is a prototype model for the study of collective phenomena in disordered systems .",
    "although it neglects thermal fluctuations , it contains essential competitions between the quenched disorder , the ferromagnetic interaction and the external applied field .",
    "the model can be numerically studied from two different points of view : on the one hand , the exact ground state calculation @xcite provides an approach to the equilibrium phase diagram . on the other",
    "the use of a local relaxation dynamics based on single spin - flips provides a good framework for the understanding of avalanche dynamics and hysteresis @xcite , which is closer to experimental observations . in this sense ,",
    "the model is a good workbench for the comparison of equilibrium and out - of - equilibrium trajectories .    a number of non",
    "- equilibrium work theorems @xcite have received a lot of attention in the last 10 years , particularly after the work of jarzynski in 1997 @xcite .",
    "these theorems relate in different ways the distribution of work performed on a system which is driven out of equilibrium to some equilibrium thermodynamic properties .",
    "one example is the original jarzinsky s equality : @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the work performed on the system that has been driven ( out - of - equilibrium ) by varying an external control parameter @xmath3 changing from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the free energy difference between two states @xmath7 and @xmath8 that correspond to the equilibrium states at @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the average @xmath9 should be understood as obtained after many repetitions of the driving process .",
    "the system is assumed to be in contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath10 which generates an statistical ensemble of copies of the system which is the source of work fluctuations .",
    "most of these theorems have been experimentally verified .",
    "@xcite    the goal of this paper is to investigate how such kind of theorems can be extended to systems at @xmath0 .",
    "in such a case , although equilibrium states and out - of - equilibrium trajectories are well defined , there are no thermal fluctuations .",
    "a priori it seems that there is no statistical ensemble over which one can define probability distributions or averages .",
    "the idea we want to test is whether or not , for systems with quenched disorder , the thermal ensemble can be substituted by the ensemble of different realizations of disorder and still some work theorems can be applied .    in order to perform the @xmath11 limit",
    "we choose a different but related work theorem which is crooks fluctuations theorem @xcite . the advantage will be that it allows to derive an equality that can be extrapolated to the @xmath11 limit .",
    "this theorem can be written as : @xmath12 in this case @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the probability densities corresponding to the out - of - equilibrium work performed on a system driven forward from @xmath4 to @xmath5 and reversely from @xmath5 to @xmath4 .",
    "the crooks fluctuation theorem has been formulated under several assumptions : the driven systems must be finite , classical and coupled to a thermal bath . moreover , the dynamics should be stochastic , markovian and reversible and the entropy production should be odd under time reversal .",
    "some of these assumptions are clearly not accomplished at the work at hand .",
    "for instance the thermal bath is at @xmath0 and the dynamics is deterministic .",
    "nevertheless we have been a little speculative and investigated the possibility of extending the crooks fluctuation theorem to @xmath0 for systems with quenched disorder .    from eq .",
    "( [ crooks ] ) one can derive that the value @xmath15 for which the two probability densities are equal , i.e. @xmath16 satisfies @xmath17 .",
    "this result is particularly suitable to be investigated at @xmath18 .",
    "note that in the low temperature limit , the only possibility to have a crossing point of the probability densities at @xmath15 is that @xmath19 , so that the diverging behaviour of @xmath20 might be cancelled to get a finite limit @xmath21 .",
    "for our investigation we consider the random field ising model .",
    "a set of @xmath22 spin variables @xmath23 with @xmath24 is defined on a regular 3d cubic lattice with linear size @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we are interested in following the response of the order parameter ( magnetization ) @xmath27 as a function of the external driving field @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( magnetic enthalpy ) of the model is defined as : @xmath28 @xmath29 where the first sum in eq .",
    "[ energy ] , extending over nearest neigbours pairs , accounts for a ferromagnetic exchange interaction , the second term in eq .",
    "[ energy ] includes the interaction with the quenched disorder and the second term in eq .",
    "[ hamiltonian ] accounts for the interaction with the external field @xmath3 that will be used as the driving parameter .",
    "the local fields @xmath30 are independent random variables , quenched , gaussian distributed with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath31 . all along the paper we will use small letters ( @xmath32,@xmath33 ) to refer to intensive magnitudes .    the equilibrium properties of this model can be studied at @xmath0 . for a given realization of the random fields @xmath34 and a given value of @xmath3 , the exact ground state can be found in a polynomial time @xcite .",
    "moreover optimized algorithms can also be used to obtain the full sequence of ground - sates as a function of @xmath3 between the two saturated states @xmath35 at @xmath36 and @xmath37 at @xmath38 @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the 3d model exhibits a first order phase transition at @xmath39 and for @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "although finite systems do not exhibit a true phase transition , there is a region of @xmath31 and @xmath3 where the correlation length is of the same order as the system size .",
    "this leads to collective effects and correlations involving all the spins of the system .    concerning the non - equilibrium trajectories ,",
    "the model has been intensively studied by using the so called single - spin flip metastable dynamics at @xmath0 which can be understood as a @xmath41 glauber dynamics .",
    "it consists in adiabatically sweeping the external field and relaxing individual spins according to their local energy , i.e. spins should align with the local field @xmath42 where the sum extends over the neigbours of spin @xmath43 .",
    "note that the reversal of a spin at a given field @xmath3 may induce the reversal of some of its neigbours at the same field @xmath3 .",
    "such collective events are the so called avalanches that end when all the spins are stable .",
    "only after the avalanches have finished , the external field is varied again .",
    "it has been shown that , during a monotonous driving of the external field , no reverse spin - flips may occur and , moreover , the model exhibits the so called abelian property : i.e. the final states do not depend on the order in which the unstable spins are flipped . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the system with this metastable dynamics also shows a critical point at @xmath44 @xcite , below which the metastable trajectory exhibits a discontinuity .",
    "note that avalanches are the source of energy dissipation @xcite .",
    "if we think about an increasing field trajectory , the triggering spin of each avalanche flips at the field @xmath3 that corresponds to @xmath45 .",
    "this spin , therefore , flips without energy loss @xmath46 .",
    "but the subsequent unstable spins flip ( at a fixed external field @xmath3 ) with an external force @xmath47 giving raise to an energy loss ( associated to each individual spin flip ) @xmath48 with @xmath49 . for the decreasing field branches , @xmath50 but",
    "the energy loss is then @xmath51 since the spins flip from @xmath8 to @xmath52",
    ".    note that in this discussion we are using the standard definition of work that is not a state function .",
    "it is computed as a sum over the ( @xmath53 ) spins that flip along the trajectory @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "recently there has been a discussion @xcite on which is the most suitable definition of work to be used in such non - equilibrium work theorems .",
    "already from the initial jarzynski works @xcite , it was proposed that if the system is driven by controlling the external field , the convenient definition of work is the integral over the trajectory @xmath56 .",
    "note that along a metastable trajectory , the two definitions of work are related by @xmath57 . without going into the discussion , we will numerically test here the two possibilities . in sec .",
    "[ w ] we will test whether the crossing point @xmath15 of the histograms @xmath13 and @xmath14 satisfies @xmath58 and , in sec .",
    "[ v ] we will test whether the crossing point @xmath59 of the histograms @xmath60 and @xmath61 satisfies the corresponding equation : @xmath62 the test of the two hypothesis will require slightly different strategies ( as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) since @xmath63 can not be computed for trajectories starting at saturation ( @xmath64 ) .    in the first strategy ( sec .",
    "[ w ] ) , we will compute forward trajectories starting from the state @xmath7 , saturated with @xmath65 at @xmath36 and sweep the field adiabatically from @xmath66 to @xmath67 until the metastable state @xmath68 is reached . then we will compute the equilibrium state @xmath8 corresponding to the field @xmath67 and perform the reverse trajectory from @xmath8 to @xmath7 with the metastable dynamics .",
    "we will compute @xmath69 and the following works ( using the standard definition ) : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the magnetizations of states @xmath68 and @xmath8 .",
    "the integrals are computed along the trajectories schematically represented in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) using eq .  [ work ] .",
    "note also that the second integral in eq .",
    "[ w01 ] can be computed since the process @xmath73 takes place at constant field @xmath67 .    in the second strategy ( sec .",
    "[ v ] ) , we will start from a computed equilibrium state at @xmath74 , perform a metastable trajectory until the state @xmath68 is reached at @xmath67 .",
    "then we will compute the equilibrium state @xmath8 at @xmath67 and perform a metastable trajectory driving back until reaching the state @xmath75 at @xmath74 .",
    "in this case we will use the alternative definition of work : @xmath76 the integrals are computed along the trajectories schematically represented in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) using @xmath77 where @xmath78 accounts for the sequence of interavalanche field increments @xmath79 occuring at constant @xmath80 along the trajectory .    .",
    "2 shows histograms corresponding to the distributions of @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath84 , @xmath85 and a system size @xmath86 .",
    "the computed histograms give an estimation of the corresponding probability densities @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "four important points should be realized from this example : ( i ) for this value of @xmath31 and field @xmath67 , the densities look symmetric and gaussian",
    ". this will not be the case when @xmath67 and @xmath31 are close to the disorder induced phase transition at @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "( ii ) second , the distribution of @xmath92 has a width similar to those of the out - of - equilibrium works .",
    "this is different from what happens in the analysis of crooks fluctuation theorem at finite @xmath93",
    ". typically , equilibrium thermal fluctuations are much smaller than work fluctuations .",
    "( iii ) for increasing systems size the histograms become narrower and then the crossing points are harder to locate ( iv ) finally , note that for this case the hypothesis that we are testing is fulfilled : the peak in @xmath89 as well as the average @xmath94 coincide with the crossing point @xmath95 of @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows histograms corresponding to @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 for @xmath99 , @xmath100 and a system size @xmath86 .",
    "note than in this case , the work distributions as well as the energy distribution are very asymmetric .",
    "this is because although in this case we expect @xmath101 since @xmath102 , a certain non vanishing fraction of the equilibrium states still has @xmath103 , as schematically indicated in fig.[fig4 ] . in other words , for certain realizations of disorder",
    ", the state @xmath8 turns out to be non - typical and previous to the equilibrium transition from @xmath104 to @xmath105 .",
    "consequently , the distribution of reverse works @xmath106 widens enormously .",
    "as can be seen the proposed equality @xmath107 clearly fails in this case .",
    "the relative error is @xmath108 .",
    "we have performed a detailed study of the deviation of @xmath95 from @xmath109 for different values of @xmath31 , @xmath67 and @xmath25 .",
    "examples of the results are presented in fig .",
    "note that the data corresponding to the crossing point @xmath95 exhibits increasing error bars with increasing @xmath67 .",
    "this is because the histograms of @xmath87 , @xmath88 become more and more separated and the finding of the intersection requires more and more statistics .",
    "( this problem is accentuated for larger values of @xmath67 and for larger system sizes ) .",
    "one can conclude therefore than the proposed extrapolation of crooks theorem , given by the equality @xmath110 fails in the region of @xmath31 and @xmath67 where the system exhibits a collective behaviour ( i.e. the correlation length is similar to the system size ) because of the proximity of the equilibrium phase transition .",
    "consistently , we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ( comparing the data corresponding to @xmath86 and @xmath111 at @xmath112 ) that the region of breakdown becomes smaller when the system size @xmath25 is larger . as expected , increasing the system size with fixed correlation length decreases the collective effects .",
    "fig . [ fig6 ] shows histograms corresponding to the distributions of @xmath113 and @xmath114 for the case @xmath86 , @xmath99 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "as can be seen the intersection point @xmath117 agrees very well with the average value of @xmath118 . in this case",
    "we have also studied if this agreement is equally good in other regions of the phase diagram .",
    "fig [ fig7 ] shows a comparison of @xmath94 and @xmath119 . on the right hand side ,",
    "the value of @xmath117 has not been obtained by a direct location of the intersection of the histograms but locating the mid point between the positions of the maxima of the histograms corresponding to @xmath120 and @xmath121 which are far separated but very symmetric . as can be seen , as occurs with strategy 1",
    ", the agreement @xmath122 fails when @xmath123 approaches the phase transition region .",
    "we have investigated the possibility of extending some work fluctuation theorems to @xmath0 for systems with quenched disorder . in this case",
    ", thermal averages should be substituted by disorder averages .",
    "we have proposed an hypothesis based on the extrapolation of crooks theorem to the @xmath41 limit and we have numerically tested its validity .",
    "the hypothesis is that if one considers the distributions of non - equilibrium work corresponding to a forward and backwards trajectory , the crossing point @xmath95 of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , is equal to the average of the internal energy difference @xmath124 .",
    "the investigation has been done by considering two strategies , based on the two possible definitions of work that have been discussed in the literature : @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the reported numerical investigation indicates that , for both strategies , the formulated hypothesis is valid when the system does not behave collectively .",
    "thus , far from the equilibrium critical point , where correlations are small compared to system size , the distribution @xmath127 is very symmetric and the average ( equilibrium ) value @xmath128 can be obtained from the crossing point @xmath95 of the distributions of the non equilibrium works .    when the system is close to the critical point a definitive conclusion can not be stated .",
    "data for small @xmath25 suggest that when the correlation length approaches the system size @xmath25 , the distribution @xmath127 is very assymetric and there is no connection between the equilibrium value @xmath128 and the crossing point @xmath95 of the non - equilibrium work distributions . a bigger computational effort ( not affordable at present ) would be needed in order to compute the accurate histograms for @xmath129 .",
    "the presented results may provide some clues for future investigations in order to extend work fluctuation theorems .",
