    "all other solutions to the equation @xmath59 are given by  .",
    "the length of @xmath56 with respect to @xmath4 is the minimal value of the function @xmath169 at an integer value of @xmath61 .",
    "we have @xmath170 and the graph of @xmath171 is given in figure  [ ca - weight ] ( full line ) .",
    "and @xmath172    since the function @xmath171 is decreasing for values of @xmath61 smaller than @xmath173 , achieves its minimum at @xmath173 and is increasing for values of @xmath61 greater than @xmath173 , the length of @xmath56 is obtained either at the integer @xmath174 that is closest to @xmath173 to the left of @xmath173 or the integer @xmath175 that is closest to @xmath173 to the right of @xmath173 .",

    "if there exists an integer in the closed interval @xmath178 $ ] , then @xmath56 can not be a dead end ( to the right of @xmath179 the function @xmath176 is 1 unit above @xmath171 , implying that the length of @xmath143 is larger than the length of @xmath56 ) .",
    "assume that @xmath2 is a positive dead end , @xmath180 , and @xmath72 and @xmath73 are chosen so that @xmath181 .",
    "this means that the minimum of @xmath182 at an integer point is achieved at @xmath100 and there is no integer in the interval @xmath178 $ ] .",
    "thus , either @xmath183 or @xmath184 . in the former case @xmath185 , while in the latter @xmath71 . in each case",
    "we conclude that @xmath2 is a frobenius value by lemma  [ l : who - is - f ] .    if @xmath2 is a negative dead end , then @xmath2 is just negative of some positive dead end , so @xmath2 is a frobenius value in this case as well .",
    "thus we proved that all dead ends are frobenius values . since",
    "dead ends are maximal in the cayley order they must be maximal frobenius values as well .    by lema",
    "[ l : equiv ] , the maximal frobenius values are precisely the frobenius values of length @xmath103 , and these values are explicitly described in lemma  [ l : explicit ] . by theorem  [ t : equiv ]",

    "the lists of numbers given in the claims of lemma  [ l : explicit ] and theorem  [ t : explicit ] coincide .",
    "the claim on the lengths of dead ends follows from the corresponding claim on the lengths of maximal frobenius values ( lemma  [ l : equiv ] ) .    in the course of the first proof of the direction ( ii ) implies ( i ) of theorem  [ t : equiv ] we already proved that ,",
    "if @xmath43 is even then , for any dead end @xmath56 , @xmath188 .",
    "thus , in this case all dead ends are strict .",
    "the equality @xmath189 for @xmath190 , shows that , when @xmath43 is odd , each dead end has another dead end as a neighbor in the cayley graph , which then means that none of them is a strict dead end ( since they all have the same length ) .",

    "indeed , assume @xmath200 , for some @xmath199",
    ". then we have @xmath201 which implies that @xmath202 a contradiction .",

    "but then @xmath213 and therefore @xmath214 which shows that @xmath56 is not a dead end .",

    "warshall showed  @xcite that if @xmath11 is a finitely generated group with infinitely many finite homomorphic images then , for every @xmath6 , @xmath11 has a finite generating set with respect to which @xmath11 has dead ends of depth at least @xmath6 .",

    "let @xmath216 be any generating set for @xmath11 and let @xmath217 be the set obtained from @xmath216 by removing any generators that happen to be in @xmath218 . for every @xmath1 in @xmath217 define @xmath219 and let @xmath220      since @xmath222 the length of @xmath0 is no greater than 2 . on the other hand , @xmath0 is not equal to any of the generators in @xmath4 or their inverses ( this is because the order of @xmath0 is at least 5 and @xmath223 ) .",

    "therefore @xmath11 is a homomorphic image of the free burnside group @xmath230 .",

    "the statement in theorem  [ t : theyexist ] is concerned only with infinite groups since finite groups always have dead ends . however , for completeness , we observe that dead ends of length 2 can be achieved in any group that is sufficiently large to allow elements of length 2 to exist ( thus all groups but the trivial group and the cyclic groups of order 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ t : theyexist ] applies unless @xmath11 is a finite group in which every element has order 2 or 3 . in that case , let @xmath0 be any nontrivial element of @xmath11 . since @xmath0 has order 2 or 3 and @xmath231 the set @xmath232 is a proper subgroup of @xmath11 .",
    "the set @xmath233 is then a finite generating set for @xmath11 ( since the complement of a proper subgroup always generates the group ) .",
