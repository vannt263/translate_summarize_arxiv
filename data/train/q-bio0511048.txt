    "the penna model was devised in 1995 by t.  j.  p.  penna @xcite to model the process of evolutionary ageing through mutation accumulation . the idea that natural selection would permit behaviour such as ageing is initially baffling",
    ": it would seem that survival of the fittest would remove any such detrimental behaviour .",
    "medawar proposed @xcite that certain genes may be age specific in their effects ; if such genes are harmful and are activated late on in the reproductive life of an organism , natural selection against them will be much weaker than if they had become active earlier in the organism s life . given the existence of such genes , it can be anticipated that harmful genetic conditions will become more common as an organism ages giving rise to increasing mortality rates with age .",
    "the penna model is a means to model the evolution of an age - structured population under the influence of age - specific harmful mutations @xcite .",
    "traditionally , mortality rates are known to rise exponentially for early ages , giving rise to the gompertz law @xcite of mortality .",
    "more recent experiments using much larger sample populations have shown that the mortality rate for advanced ages is seen to slow substantially giving rise to a mortality plateau or peaks @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that a modified penna model while continuing to show gompertz growth in mortality rates at early ages can also exhibit a mortality plateau at advanced ages @xcite .",
    "the original penna model is discrete in nature , with time represented by an integer and an organism s genome by a bit - string .",
    "each @xmath0 on the bit - string represents a healthy site ; each @xmath1 is a harmful mutation which becomes active once the organism reaches age @xmath2 where @xmath2 is the index of the site on the bit - string .",
    "having activated @xmath3 harmful mutations an organism dies .",
    "the bit - string is taken to be finite in length ( usually 32 bits ) and each newborn organism has a number of mutations @xmath4 introduced into the bit - string .",
    "these mutations are taken to be harmful so can only turn healthy sites into unhealthy ones - a mutation on an unhealthy site is ignored .",
    "this assumption is relaxed in @xcite where a small rate of positive mutation is allowed : we confine ourselves here to the case of only harmful mutations .    scaling behaviour",
    "was considered by malarz @xcite who investigated the effects of different bit string lengths on the penna model .",
    "malarz inquired as to whether large bit strings were required or whether one could expect , after appropriate scaling of other parameters , one would get the same results for different genome lengths .",
    "investigating the effects of string length through simulation , malarz was unable to find scaling in the penna model .",
    "almeida et al .",
    "@xcite later considered a continuous penna model and for certain mutation regimes were able to find simple scaling relations . to obtain such scaling",
    "the authors decoupled the string - length and mutation rate so that the probability of finding a given number of mutations in a given string length was given by a poisson distribution .",
    "they also observed that the penna model is able to sustain a maximum possible lifespan in steady - state , which we call @xmath5 : if the imposed string length is greater than @xmath5 then it will have no effect on the properties of the population ; if it is less than @xmath5 then the imposed string length will impose a maximum lifespan on the population and the distribution will be accordingly altered .",
    "the authors suggested that the size of timesteps in a discrete penna model may have an effect on scaling behaviour but did not investigate the size or nature of this effect .",
    "brigatti et al .  @xcite investigated scaling in a sexual penna model through simulation and suggested that results from the continuum model of almeida et al .",
    "@xcite were not readily mapped onto the discrete model employed in simulation . scaling effects in the sexual model",
    "were also investigated by laszkiewicz et al .",
    "@xcite through simulation .    in this paper",
    "we extend our previous analytical solution of the asexual model @xcite to examine the scaling behaviour .",
    "we show that the scale invariance emerges as we increase the number of discrete genome bits , and that the scaling becomes exact in the continuum case , which can be regarded as the limit of infinite genome bits coupled with a vanishing mutation rate per bit .",
    "this establishes a clear relationship between the distribution , parameters and scaling behaviour of the continuum model of almeida et al .  and those of the traditional discrete model .",
    "finally , we use scale invariance to analytically show that at early ages mortality rates grow exponentially in accordance with the gompertz law @xcite which , for the lack of a general proof , is still generally regarded as being empirical @xcite .",
    "the asexual penna model can be reformulated @xcite so that rather than considering discrete timesteps , time is treated as a continuous variable , @xmath6 .",
    "the bit - string of an organism is replaced by an axis representing the genome : position @xmath2 on the genome is examined at age @xmath2 .",
    "harmful mutations are then represented by @xmath7 functions along the genome . after accumulating @xmath3",
    "@xmath7 functions an organism dies .    for our analytical solutions ,",
    "we concern ourselves primarily with @xmath8 as generalizing a @xmath8 solution for a continuous model will be no more difficult than generalizing a discrete @xmath8 model , as done previously @xcite . in the continuum penna model an organism reproduces at a constant rate @xmath9 and",
    "dies at age @xmath2 where its genome has its first harmful mutation ( @xmath7 function ) at position @xmath2 .",
    "an organism can be characterised by its age @xmath2 and its genetic lifespan @xmath10 ( the position on the genome of the first harmful mutation ) .",
    "neither @xmath2 nor @xmath10 are constrained to be integers .",

    "the probability of giving birth in time @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 , the probability of a mutation being introduced in length @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 .",
    "these definitions are consistent with the discrete penna model where sites can be interpreted as infinitessimal lengths of genome and timesteps as infinitessimal units of time .",
    "the probability of no mutations occuring in length @xmath17 is @xmath19 which is @xmath20 for infinitessimal @xmath17 .",
    "newborn organisms may be produced as unmutated copies of organisms with equal genetic lifespan , or as mutated copies of naturally longer lived organisms .",
    "an equation can then be constructed for the production of new organisms within the population for the infinitesimal time period of @xmath6 to @xmath21 @xmath22 where subscripts @xmath6 and @xmath23 denote time . at steady - state , the subscripts",

    "i.e. _ not reliant on mutated births .",
    "no other sub - population can be self - sustaining if the population is to remain bounded , as shorter - lived organisms can always be created by mutated copies of longer - lived ones .",
    "for the longest - lived sub - population to be self - sustaining , each organism must produce one perfect copy of itself during its lifetime @xmath25 all other populations , with @xmath26 , gain from mutated births of the longest lived , so unmutated birth per individual must , on average , be less than unity @xmath27 these conditions can be combined to give @xcite @xmath28 in the discrete penna model the probability of no mutation for @xmath1 site or bit is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mutation rate per site . the probability for @xmath10 sites without mutations would be @xmath31 . in the limit of @xmath32 , @xmath33 and",
    "therefore @xmath30 play the same role as @xmath34 in the continuous case , where the probability of no mutations in genome length @xmath10 is @xmath35 .",
    "thus we can identify the continuum penna model as the limit of the discrete model as the mutation rate per site tends to zero .",
    "for vanishingly small units of discretization , a discrete model becomes a continuous one .",
    "a measure of the extent of discretization is the size of one of the discrete units divided by the total size of the system ; for the penna model this is @xmath36 .",
    "as the extent of discretization gets smaller , @xmath37 tends to infinity which implies a vanishing mutation rate .",

    "we examine the discrete and continuous penna models in turn to examine how they behave under rescaling . informed by this behaviour we interpret the continuous model as the limit of a discrete model with a vanishingly small mutation rate .",
    "the traditional asexual penna model has one unit of discretization for each unit of time .",
    "it is possible to rescale the discrete penna model so that each unit of time is broken up into several timesteps .",
    "this can be done by taking a penna model with a maximum lifespan of @xmath40 and rescaling @xmath10 so that , in the rescaled time units , the model has maximum lifespan @xmath37 and @xmath41 distinct timesteps in one unit of time .",
    "for example , an @xmath42 model could be rescaled to give an @xmath43 model with two timesteps per unit of time .",
    "when discussing rescaled penna models we require that the steady - state conditions are invariant under rescaling . for a population with @xmath44 , the steady - state conditions should be the same regardless of how many timesteps one unit of time has been broken up into . for steady - state conditions to be invariant under rescaling the population with genetic lifespan @xmath37 must be self - sustaining and all other populations partly dependent on mutation .",
    "the first condition can be written as : @xmath45 a model rescaled by a factor @xmath41 will allow @xmath46 to exist , where @xmath41 gives the number of units of discretization per time interval . the same conditions , equation ( [ eq : trouble]-[eq : trouble2 ] ) , apply as before .",
    "a population is then identified by the largest ( unscaled ) value of @xmath37 it can sustain .",
    "when steady - state is required to be robust under rescaling of the model a population can be uniquely identified by the maximum genetic lifespan it can maintain .    for rescaled models to be the same they should give the same population sizes at comparable points up to an arbitrary scaling factor . if the discrete penna model is scale invariant , it should be possible to rescale a model to obtain an unscaled model with shorter @xmath5 .",
    "for instance : an @xmath47 model with scaled by a factor of @xmath48 will have a rescaled maximum lifespan of @xmath49 ; if the penna model is scale invariant this rescaled model will , at comparable points give identical results to an unscaled @xmath50 model ( up to a constant normalisation factor for finite size scaling ) .",

    "only comparable points have been shown.,width=288 ]    for a penna model to have @xmath37 a factor of @xmath41 greater , the mutation rate and birth rate must be a factor of @xmath41 smaller .",
    "if the parameters of the model which is rescaled are labelled as @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 ; then scaled and unscaled parameters are related by : @xmath69    application of these scaling rules ; the recursion relation between successive sub - populations at steady - state ; and our condition for scale invariance of the model gives a relation , in terms of birth and mutation rate , which must be satisfied for the discrete model to be scale invariant . for a rescaling by a factor of @xmath48",
    "we require that @xmath70    this equality can not be satisfied due to the factor of @xmath71 on the bottom of the recursion relation . as such , the discrete penna model does not exhibit scale invariance . in the limit of a vanishing mutation rate : @xmath72 approaches unity , the differences between scaled and unscaled models vanish and the discrete model will become scale invariant . fig .",
    "[ figscalingtrio ] confirms that the scaled results of the discrete model do approach a limiting ` master curve ' .",
    "this limit is the same as that which gives the continuous model , so we expect to find the continuous model to be scale invariant .",

    "we identify a population by the largest value of @xmath37 it can sustain .",
    "this value is no longer constrained to be an integer and can be simply expressed as @xmath74 .",
    "rescaling of a continuous penna model is carried out in much the same way as in the discrete case : @xmath37 is divided by a scale factor @xmath41 and the new model has a correspondingly reduced maximum lifespan . in the continuous model time is not broken into distinct timesteps , but is treated as a continuum : as a result rescaling will not alter the number of timesteps in one unit of time .",
    "if a continuous model is to be invariant under rescaling by a factor @xmath41 , through similar reasoning as in the discrete case , @xmath75 upon substitution of the steady - state relation for continuous penna model populations , this is satisfied by @xmath76\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{al+ax}{al}\\frac{e^{\\beta ' al}-b'al}{e^{\\beta'(al+ax)}-b'(al+ax)}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\exp\\left[{\\int_{al}^{al+ax}\\frac{\\beta'b'al'}{b'al'-e^{\\beta ' al'}}\\d al'}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the mutation rate and birth rate in the rescaled model are labelled @xmath66 and @xmath68 .",
    "if , by rescaling the model by a factor @xmath41 , the maximum lifespans are to be the same then the mutation and birth rates must be related by : @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",

    "in other words , for a vanishing mutation rate , the discrete model becomes scale invariant .",
    "as the limits of a vanishing mutation rate and maximum genetic lifespan tending to infinity are equivalent , approximate scale invariance becomes more realistic for discrete penna models of increasingly large @xmath5 .",
    "early age penna mortality rates display the exponential growth predicted by the gompertz law . using our analytical solution to the simple penna model we evaluate the growth exponent @xmath80 where the mortality rate at age @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath81 .",
    "evaluation of the gompertz growth rate in terms of penna model parameters will facilitate the fitting of penna parameters to real world data . throughout",
    "we assume that any model has adopted the maximum genetic lifespan allowed by its mutation rate .",
    "recall that for the simple discrete penna model the mortality rate is given by @xmath82 using the steady state recursion relation from the simple penna model , the ratio between successive mortality rates can be evaluated analytically @xmath83.\\label{mortalityratio}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to usefully exploit this expression , we consider the limit of small @xmath2 , and small @xmath34 where the penna model becomes scale invariant ; numerical evaluation of the summation term and predicted scaling behaviour can be used to simplify equation ( [ mortalityratio ] ) .",
    "numerically , we find for @xmath84 @xmath85 crucially , if the penna model exhibits universality as discussed earlier , this result remains valid for _ all _ values of @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , noting the continuous penna model result @xmath86 and @xmath87 , in the regime of small @xmath88 , a first order expansion of equation ( [ mortalityratio ] ) leads to @xmath89 which then implies @xmath90 namely the gompertz law , which states that the mortality rate increases exponentially at early ages .",
    "furthermore , it predicts that the exponential coefficient of the gompertz growth rate is given by @xmath9 , the birth rate . in fig .",
    "[ figgompertz ] , we compare this birth rate with the exponential gompertz coefficients , extracted by taking the difference between the logs of mortality rates at ages @xmath91 and @xmath92 for each population .    the exponential coefficient of gompertz growth in mortality rate estimated from early age mortality rates ( @xmath38 ) is plotted against the maximum lifespan the population can sustain ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the dashed line gives the birth rate at each value of @xmath5.,width=288 ]    our approximation depends on @xmath93 , therefore , deviation from gompertz behaviour at later ages ( large @xmath2 ) is expected as the numerical approximation , equation ( [ numericalmortalityresult ] ) , breaks down as @xmath2 increases .",
    "similarly , as shown in fig .  [ figgompertz ] , for small values of @xmath5 this approximation works less well but for larger values of @xmath5 it becomes increasingly accurate .",
    "we have shown by means of exact analytic solution that , in the asexual penna model , a universal scale invariance emerges as we increase the number of genome bits / sites , with the invariance becoming exact in the limit of the continuum model .",
    "in addition , we have built on this result and shown that scale invariance may be employed to derive an analytical expression for the gompertz law of mortality , which has been generally regarded as empirical .",
