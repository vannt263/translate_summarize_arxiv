    "accretion onto black holes commonly results in relativistic , collimated outflows , or jets . in black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxbs ) , these jets can brighten , fade or even switch off all together on timescales of days  months ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "when jets are observed in bhxbs they usually manifest themselves as powerful , compact outflows commonly seen as a flat or slightly inverted radio spectrum ( @xmath1  0.5 , where @xmath2 ) and are spatially resolved in some cases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and are considered to be analogous to persistent compact radio sources associated with active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . in bhxbs ,",
    "most of the energy radiated by these jets is emitted at higher energies , for example in the infrared / optical regime ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these discrete ejections are typically seen once , or at most a few times during a bhxb outburst cycle .",

    "* ) . for comparison , a compact jet such as that of gx 3394 mentioned above produces this much radiative energy in @xmath10 minutes during a bright hard state @xcite .",
    "since hard states normally last several months , the transient jets probably provide a negligible fraction of the total radiative power of jets from bhxbs .",
    "however , for both types of jet , the total kinetic power they contain is largely unknown , so comparisons can only be made between their radiative luminosities .",
    "it is worth assessing whether the same physical process is responsible for launching both types of jet .    the physical mechanism responsible for the launching , acceleration and collimation of jets has been debated for decades , and remains one of the major paradigms in the field of accretion in strong gravitational fields .",
    "it is generally accepted that magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) processes are at work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but two groups of models are usually considered that can both produce the poloidal magnetic fields and differential rotation necessary to launch powerful jets @xcite .",

    "* for a similar scaling based on general - relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations ) .",
    "the two leading methods currently adopted to infer bh spin in bhxbs are x - ray thermal continuum fitting , and x - ray reflection / fe k@xmath16 line fitting .",
    "the former applies to spectra of bhxbs in the thermal dominant ( or high / soft ) state @xcite , while the latter fits ( low/)hard state spectra at eddington rates higher than about @xmath17 . in essence , the thermal continuum fitting method provides a measure of the area subtended by the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , while the reflection method returns a measure of the gravitational redshift that shapes the red wing of the broadened fe k@xmath16 line .",
    "both methods rely on the assumption that the accretion disc extends in to the isco , which is in turn a function of bh spin .",
    "the reader is referred to e.g. @xcite and @xcite for further details on the two methodologies .",
    "bhxbs , as opposed to agn , are particularly suited for this kind of study . in outburst ,",
    "galactic bhxbs tend to be brighter than all agn in the sky , so with more photons , spectral fitting can be achieved with a higher level of precision .",
    "in addition , the thermal continuum fitting method can not be applied to agn , since the peak of the disc emission falls in the uv band .",
    "measures of bh jet powers also rely on different methods , arguably all more indirect than those adopted for estimating the spin parameter , such as the relative normalization of the radio / infrared ( ir ) versus x - ray luminosity in the hard state for compact jets , and the total energy in the bright radio flares that are thought to be at the origin of the large scale , transient jets .    in a previous work ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fgr10 ) we performed the first study to observationally test for empirical relations between bh spin ( @xmath18 ) and jet power .",
    "x - ray and ir  x - ray correlations exist in the hard state but some bhxbs are more radio - bright ( or infrared - bright ) than others , at a given x - ray luminosity .",
    "the luminosity of the jet at radio and ir frequencies relative to the x - ray luminosity ( the normalization of the correlation ) was used to rank the bhxbs in order of jet power .",
    "no single relation was found between current reported bh spin measurements and relative luminosity of compact jets .",
    "this suggested that if the relative jet power estimates and bh spin estimates are accurate , compact jets may not be spin - powered .    since the acceleration and collimation regions of compact jets are usually considered to be at least tens to hundreds of @xmath19 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these results may not be surprising because this is essentially outside the region where bh spin energy can be tapped .",
    "in addition , the jet is usually required to be anchored to a thick disc , which is thought to be present in the hard x - ray state ( e.g. @xcite ; see also @xcite ; however a thin disc that extends close to the isco may exist above @xmath20 in the hard state ; @xcite ) .",
    "very recently , the actual base of the jet of the agn in m87 has been spatially resolved using radio interferometry , and its size was measured to be @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "however even here , the wide opening angle of the sub - relativistic jet and the existence of a counter jet indicates that this jet is anchored within ( and powered by ) the accretion disk and not launched due to magnetic field lines crossing the event horizon @xcite .",
    "the radio / ir normalization for a single source can change in time @xcite which , if x - ray luminosity is not the quantity that is changing , invalidates a single relationship between radio / ir luminosity normalization and jet power ( or jet radiative efficiency ) .",
    "some mhd simulations of disc - emitting jets have also successfully described properties of the outflows commonly seen in bhxbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , @xcite found no significant correlation between the spin of neutron stars in x - ray binaries ( which can be measured accurately for some but not all sources considered ) and their relative jet powers inferred from radio or infrared jet luminosities ( although less data were available for neutron star jets , and those data span a smaller range in luminosity than the sample of bhxbs ) . finally , in a related study , @xcite considers the johannsen - psaltis metric around a bh , a speculative , alternative space - time metric to the kerr metric . in this scenario ,",
    "current data of bhxbs suggest there may be a correlation between bh spin as defined by this metric , and compact jet power .",
    "the only tentative relation found by fgr10 was between _ transient _ jet ejection energy and bh spin measured via reflection fits ( but not continuum fits ) , from four data points ( fig . 6 in fgr10 ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite ( 2012 ; hereafter nm12 ) claim a relation between transient jet peak radio luminosity and bh spin measured from thermal continuum fitting , using a sub - sample of the data in the literature .",
    "nm12 take the peak luminosity of the radio flare associated with the hard - to - soft state transition as their estimate of the jet power ( as opposed to an estimate of the total energy of the ejection ) .    here , we test for a relation between transient jet power and reported bh spin using all the available data ( described in section 2 ) , adopting two differing methods to infer the jet power and two methods to estimate bh spin .",
    "we make use of a bayesian fitting routine in order to quantify the significance of any relation ( the methodology is explained in section 3 ) . in all cases ,",
    "no significant correlation is found .",
    "if the methods used to infer jet power and bh spin are correct , we can rule out a single positive correlation between transient jet power and bh spin with high confidence .",

    "4u 154347 , a radio flare seen during the state transition during its 2002 outburst was one of the few in the literature where the rise of the flare was reported and well sampled in time @xcite , rising at 0.81.0 ghz from @xmath32 mjy to @xmath33 mjy in 6.0 h , then peaking at @xmath34 mjy just 2.0 h later .",
    "less than a day ( 19.0 h ) after this brightest detection , the source had faded to @xmath35 mjy at 0.8 ghz .",
    "the light curve morphology is typical of a flare event often seen over the state transition ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "radio flares typically rise faster than they fade , so it is unlikely that the peak of this radio flare was much brighter than the observed peak of 22 mjy ( nm12 take this flux density as a lower limit ) . in addition , the rise times of all radio flares are consistent with being around 5  12 h ( table 1 ; see also table 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "as an extremely conservative estimate , the peak could have been twice as bright as that observed , so we estimate a peak radio flux density of 2244 mjy at 0.81.0 ghz .",
    "we use the method of nm12 of assuming @xmath36 for the spectral index of the optically thin radio flare in order to estimate the 5 ghz flux , which was 11.623.4 mjy .",
    "gro j165540 had a very bright radio flare of 2 jy in 1994 which was associated with relativistic ejecta @xcite , whereas in 2005 , an optically thin radio flare was detected at @xmath37 mjy , @xmath38 mjy and @xmath39 mjy at 1.43 ghz , 4.86 ghz and 8.46 ghz , respectively , which then decayed over the next few days @xcite .",
    "the radio light curve is well sampled , with daily coverage ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "this was the brightest flare seen from gro j165540 during the hard to soft state transition of this outburst , and occurred within days of the source entering the soft state @xcite , which is fairly typical @xcite .",
    "from these two outbursts with well sampled radio monitoring , it is clear that the peak luminosity of the flare associated with the state transition can vary by three orders of magnitude .",
    "the fainter flare in 2005 had a longer rise time , and the resulting total energy required to produce the 1994 and 2005 radio flares may only differ by only a factor @xmath40 ( see section 3 ) .",
    "+        four bright 5 ghz radio flares of grs 1915 + 105 are known to have peaked at flux densities between 150 and 912 mjy ( table 1 ) .",
    "nm12 already noted that the bright radio flare of grs 1915 + 105 seen in 1997 peaked at a luminosity @xmath41 times fainter than the bright radio flare in 1994 , which invalidates a single relation between bh spin and peak radio flare luminosity because the bh spin can not change in three years ( nm12 only included the brightest of these two flares of grs 1915 + 105 in their following analysis of the bh spin  jet power relation ) .",
    "@xcite found from high resolution radio imaging of grs 1915 + 105 that even fainter radio flares are resolved into relativistic discrete ejecta .",
    "we therefore include all four bright radio flares in table 1 and the following analysis .",
    "these bright radio flares are not to be confused with the fainter , quasi - regular ` oscillation ' flares which peak at @xmath42 mjy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and which are not included here ( but which could be due to the same physical process ) .",
    "h1743322 also had peak radio flare flux densities in 2003 and 2009 that differed by a factor of @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "we also include cygnus x1 in our analysis .",
    "nm12 discard this source because , as they argue , the mass transfer is via a stellar wind from its high - mass companion star .",
    "although cyg x1 is a wind - fed system , an accretion disc has been detected around the bh , its size has been estimated @xcite , and the disc has even been used to infer the bh spin ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on large scales ,",
    "the mode of accretion for wind - fed systems differs to that of roche lobe overflow systems  the stellar wind ensures a relatively steady , high mass accretion rate onto the outer accretion disc .",
    "the influence of bh spin on jet production is only important on distances of @xmath43 from the bh in which general relativistic frame dragging becomes important ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "obviously the mode of accretion towards the bh on these much smaller size scales is the same for wind - fed systems as ( transient ) roche lobe accreting systems ( i.e. , matter is accreted from the inner disc into the inner regions that are affected by frame dragging ) , and is not affected by the mode of accretion on large scales ( accretion disc or wind - fed accretion ) .",
    "in addition , it is well known that cyg x1 performs state transitions that are associated with radio flares ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) like other bhxbs . the brightest radio detection of cyg x1 ever seen over years of detailed , long - term monitoring with the ryle and green bank telescopes ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was during the hard to soft state transition in 2004 , where the radio luminosity peaked at 120 mjy ( * ? ? ? * in addition , a likely extended , discrete ejection has been seen ) .",
    "in fact cyg x1 spends 10 per cent of its time in the soft state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which the radio emission is suppressed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as expected after crossing the ` jet line ' when the ballistic ejection is usually launched @xcite .",
    "cyg x1 should therefore certainly be included ; here we use the aforementioned brightest radio flare of 120 mjy at 15 ghz . again adopting @xmath36 ( nm12 ) we estimate a 5 ghz flux density of 186 mjy .",
    "the two methods we adopt to estimate the relative jet power of the discrete ejections are explained in fgr10 and nm12 , respectively . in fgr10",
    "we adopted the classical calculation of the minimum total energy required to energise a synchrotron flare , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the peak radio luminosity @xcite .",
    "this calculation is frequently used in the study of synchrotron radiation from numerous sources at wavelengths from radio to x - ray , and is a reliable measure the minimum total luminosity of an individual flare .",
    "we calculate the jet power of each radio flare listed in table 1 as a fraction of the eddington luminosity ( using the known values of distance and bh mass ) .",
    "the second method of measuring jet power is simply using the luminosity at the peak of each radio flare ( nm12 ) , which assumes the peak luminosity is a linear indicator of total jet kinetic power ( contrary to the generally accepted theoretical works ; e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this method contains fewer uncertainties , but does not take into account the different temporal profiles and hence different total energies of each radio flare .",
    "note that for both methods , the jet power as a fraction of the x - ray luminosity is not considered , because quasi - simultaneous x - ray luminosities were not available for all radio jet flares .    in fig .",

    "furthermore , the very fact that one bhxb can produce radio ejections with very different total energies and peak luminosities invalidates a single relation between transient jet radiative energy and bh spin .",
    "this latter discovery implies that many jet flares may be less luminous than the maximum value that would be produced by a purely spin - powered jet . for a typical source ,",
    "there have been a limited number of outbursts observed to date , so it could be that truly spin - powered jets do reach a constant , maximum jet power , but few flares reach this critical maximum .",
    "this could lead to underestimated jet luminosity estimates .",
    "we note that one source , grs 112468 appears to have a high jet power but a low bh spin , which is not consistent with the above picture .",
    "regular radio monitoring of populations of bhxbs over state transitions is required to measure the distribution of jet powers of discrete ejections .",
    "it is worth noting that in our study we do not include the effects of relativistic beaming of the jet emission .",
    "this is because both the orbital inclination angles ( which are usually assumed to be perpendicular to the jet axis ) and the jet lorentz factors are uncertain for many sources ( nm12 assumed a lorentz factor of @xmath64 for all sources ) .",
    "very recently , a new paper has appeared from the same group as nm12 , which again claims a correlation between bh spin ( measured from continuum fitting ) and jet power ( measured from peak luminosities ) in transient ejections @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the same subsample of bhxb spin measurements that appeared in nm12 was used , with an addition of one more spin measurement , that of h1743322 from @xcite .",
    "this spin measurement is also included in our analysis .",
    "however , it is worth noting a few discrepancies between our analysis and theirs .    for this source we took jet flares from two outbursts , 2003 and 2009 , whereas in @xcite just the former jet flare is used",
    "furthermore , we adopted the radio flare peak luminosity associated with the hard to soft transition in fig .",
    "1c ( the same method as was adopted in nm12 ) but @xcite use a fainter flare , which peaked at 35 mjy at 5 ghz instead of the brighter , 96 mjy flare we used .",
    "their arguement is that this fainter flare must have been the one associated with the launch of the jet ejection because the date on which this ejection occurred is known from resolved radio observations .",
    "however , if the bh spin powers the 35 mjy flare but not the 96 mjy flare , then what powers the brighter flare ?",
    "the 96 mjy flare had an optically thin spectrum and did not occur during the hard state @xcite , so we can rule out a compact jet origin to this brighter flare .",
    "if one of those two flares was associated with an energetic boost from the spin of the bh , one would expect it to be the brighter one .",
    "furthermore , since we showed that radio ejections observationally possess very different peak luminosities , the peak flux can not be used as a proxy for the total power of a discrete ejection .",
    "@xcite do not take into account the time over which a flare is radiated ( which empirically can vary by more than one order of magnitude ; see table 1 ) , but instead adopt @xmath65 ( see equation b10 in the appendix of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , contrary to standard classical synchrotron equation , @xmath66 .",
    "finally , a further discrepancy lies in the assumed relation between bh spin and jet power . in fitting the correlation ,",
    "@xcite assume @xmath67 , as opposed to that adopted in nm12 , @xmath48 , assume the same jet lorentz factor for all sources , and fix the power law index to 2.0 ( as indicated in footnote 6 in their paper ) .",
    "for comparison , the bayesian , linear regression analysis we present here leaves the slope as a free parameter , testing the probability that it is positive at all . as we discussed in detail in section 3 ,",
    "a full bayesian treatment , with error bars on both jet power and spin parameters included , shows that a positive correlation of the form @xmath48 is at best marginally significant ( @xmath58 ) , even when the new h1743322 data point is included .",
    "if any of the above methods of measuring bh spin or jet power are correct , then we can conclude that there is no single relation between bh spin and transient jet power .",
    "are there any reasonable explanations that could explain the lack of a correlation ?",
    "many works predict ( analytically or via simulations ) a relation between the spin of a black hole and the power of the resulting accretion - fed jet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "positive relations are generally predicted but not necessarily as simple as the @xmath48 relation originally derived by @xcite .",
    "it has recently been shown that rapidly _ retrograde _ spinning bhs ( where the bh spin is in the opposite direction to the accreting matter spiralling inwards ) can produce jets just as powerful as rapidly prograde spinning bhs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , the only source with a ( slightly ) negative spin in table 1 , grs 112468 , had a relatively powerful jet ( fig . 1 ; lower left panel )",
    "however , since several bhs with very similar spin estimates have produced flares of energies and peak luminosities spanning several orders of magnitude ( including different jet powers for different flares from the same source ) we can rule out a single relation between jet power of discrete ejections and current estimates of bh spin .",
    "this is quantified by our bayesian analysis ( figs . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the spin parameters as estimated from the two methods do not agree with each other for a number of sources , and neither is to be preferred .",
    "in addition , for compact , steady jets that exist in the hard state , radio or infrared luminosity normalization may turn out to be an unreliable tracer for jet power .",
    "dual tracks exist with sources jumping between them and having different correlation slopes @xcite , which implies that the jet luminosity is affected by additional , as yet undefined parameters as well as the mass accretion rate and ( possibly ) the bh spin .",
    "the radio / x - ray ( and ir / x - ray ) correlation normalization therefore may not be an accurate method of estimating the relative ranking of compact jet power , however the range in jet luminosities in the hard state ( for a given x - ray luminosity ) could still be improved . nevertheless , the results of fgr10 suggest there may not be a strong dependence of relative compact jet power on bh spin , even given the above caveats .",
    "it was also predicted by @xcite that jet power also scales with the square of the magnetic field strength ; @xmath68 , because the mechanism relies on differential rotation between a spinning bh and its magnetosphere .",
    "one would therefore not expect a @xmath48 correlation to exist unless the magnetic field is nearly constant across all sources ( this caveat is also mentioned , but then later ignored , in * ? ? ?",
    "in the hard state , it may be that @xmath69 , the mass accretion rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in @xcite it is argued that jet power is mostly driven by the magnetic flux , not the spin or accretion rate .",
    "jet luminosity ( measured in radio or ir ) does scale positively with x - ray luminosity and hence with mass accretion rate , in the hard state .",
    "however this is no indication of the blandford & znajek mechanism , as a positive relation between x - ray luminosity and jet power is of course also expected for the blandford ",
    "payne mechanism ( in which accretion powers the jet ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite have recently argued that jets that precess on short timescales can not be spin powered .    even if bhxb jets were powered by bh spin , the combination of several effects  including but not limited to uncertainties in measuring the relevant parameters  could still prevent us from finding a positive correlation at present .",

    "<S> we revisit the paradigm of the dependency of jet power on black hole spin in accreting black hole systems . in a previous paper we showed that the luminosity of compact jets continuously launched due to accretion onto black holes in x - ray binaries ( analogous to those that dominate the kinetic feedback from agn ) do not appear to correlate with reported black hole spin measurements . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore unclear whether extraction of the black hole spin energy is the main driver powering compact jets from accreting black holes . </S>",
    "<S> occasionally , black hole x - ray binaries produce discrete , transient ( ballistic ) jets for a brief time over accretion state changes . here </S>",
    "<S> , we quantify the dependence of the power of these transient jets ( adopting two methods to infer the jet power ) on black hole spin , making use of all the available data in the current literature , which includes 12 bhs with both measured spin parameters and radio flares over the state transition . in several sources , </S>",
    "<S> regular , well - sampled radio monitoring has shown that the peak radio flux differs dramatically depending on the outburst ( up to a factor of 1000 ) whereas the total power required to energise the flare may only differ by a factor @xmath0 between outbursts . </S>",
    "<S> the peak flux is determined by the total energy in the flare and the time over which it is radiated ( which can vary considerably between outbursts ) . using a bayesian fitting routine we rule out a statistically significant positive correlation between transient jet power measured using these methods , and current estimates of black hole spin . even when selecting subsamples of the data that disregard some methods of black hole spin measurement or jet power measurement , no correlation is found in all cases .    </S>",
