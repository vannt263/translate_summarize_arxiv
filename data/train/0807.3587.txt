    "it is generally believed that extraplanar diffuse x - ray emission detected around actively star - forming disk galaxies arises primarily from the so - called disk / halo interaction ( cox 2005 and references therein ; wang et al .",

    "existing observational work has concentrated on the overall correlation between the extraplanar x - ray emission and the integrated properties of various tracers of star formation in such galaxies , especially those with nuclear starbursts .",
    "systematic studies with _ chandra _ data ( strickland et al .  2004a ,",
    "b ) have revealed the correlation between the presence of extraplanar hot gas and warm ionized gas , which is interpreted as a result of the interaction between star formation - driven outflow of hot gas and the cooler ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the integrated extraplanar x - ray luminosity is found to be quasi - linearly correlated with the star formation rate , implying that the mechanical energy release from supernova explosions ( sne ) and massive stellar winds is converted into radiative energy with a certain efficiency .",
    "similar correlations have been demonstrated in an _ xmm - newton _ survey of edge - on galaxies with relatively normal or disk - wide star forming activity ( t@xmath6llmann et al .  2006a , b ) .",
    "in addition , there might be an energy input threshold to form a multi - phase halo ( rossa & dettmar 2003 ; dahlem et al .",
    "in general , little is yet known about the physical state of the extraplanar hot gas ( e.g. , the pressure and volume filling factor ) and its relationship with other ism components in the host halo .    the edge - on star - forming galaxy ngc 5775 ( see table [ basicpara ] for basic parameters ) is well - suited for a detailed study of the disk / halo interaction . unlike a nuclear starburst galaxy , the star formation in ngc 5775",
    "is spread out across the galactic disk .",
    "this allows us to explore the general disk / halo interaction without it being overwhelmed by a powerful galactic nuclear superwind .",
    "indeed , this galaxy is one of the rare cases in which extraplanar emission has been detected from essentially all diffuse interstellar components ( e.g. , lee et al .",

    "ngc 5775 is interacting with its companion ngc 5774 , as they are bridged by gas ( irwin 1994 ) .",
    "in addition , the kinematics of the extraplanar diffuse ionized gas has been carefully studied , showing a vertical gradient in azimuthal velocity , which is steeper than what is predicted by a ballistic model of a disk / halo flow ( heald et al .",
    "2006 ; fraternali et al .",
    "hydrodynamic effects may thus be important ( e.g. , barnab@xmath8 et al .",
    "2006 ) , which may result from the interaction of the flow with pre - existing halo gas .",

    "2001 ; t@xmath6llmann et al .",
    "2006a ) have revealed the presence of apparently diffuse x - ray emission which is generally spatially related to the extraplanar features observed at other wavelengths .",
    "however , these x - ray data of limited spatial resolution do not allow for a clean detection and removal of discrete sources or for a detailed morphological characterization of the extraplanar hot gas and its connection to other components of this galaxy .    in this paper",

    "study of ngc  5775 and confront the results with multi - wavelength data obtained from _",

    ", we mainly utilize data from the acis - s3 chip , although part of the data from the s2 chip is also used in the source detection and imaging .",
    "we reprocessed the data using ciao v3.3 ( the chandra interactive analysis of observations ) following the _ chandra _ acis data analysis guide .",
    "the light curve of the observation indicates a quiescent background rate with no significant flares .",
    "we created count and exposure maps in four bands ( 0.3 - 0.7 , 0.7 - 1.5 , 1.5 - 3 and 3 - 7 kev ) and use the `` stowed '' data for the non - x - ray background subtraction after a count rate normalization in the 10 - 12 kev range .",
    "we performed source detection in the broad ( b , 0.3 - 7 kev ) , soft ( s , 0.3 - 1.5 kev ) and hard ( h , 1.5 - 7 kev ) bands , following the procedure detailed in wang ( 2004 ) . to study the diffuse x - ray emission , we removed the detected discrete sources (   [ subsec : ps ] ) from the maps .",
    "to do so , we excluded circular regions containing twice the 90% enclosed energy radius ( eer ) around each source of a count rate @xmath9 . for brighter sources ,",
    "the source removal radius is further multiplied by a factor of @xmath10 .",
    "generally about 96 - 97% of the source counts are excluded in such a procedure .",
    "noticeably , the sky position of ngc  5775 is on the outskirts of the north polar spur ( nps ) , a galactic soft x - ray feature ( snowden et al .",
    "1995 ) that introduces an enhancement to the sky background .",
    "hence , in spectral analysis we adopted a `` double - subtraction '' procedure , similar to that used in li , wang & hameed ( 2007 ) , to determine the sky background .",
    "a source - removed local background spectrum is extracted from a region as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ pointsrc ] .",
    "the corresponding spectrum of the non - x - ray contribution is extracted from the stowed data and subtracted from the total background spectrum .",
    "we then characterize the remaining sky signals by a combination of three characteristic components : a thermal plasma model ( apec in xspec , with a temperature of @xmath4 0.1 kev ) primarily for the soft x - ray emission of the galactic halo and the local hot bubble , a second apec ( temperature @xmath40.3 kev ) for the nps emission , and a power - law ( photon index of 1.4 ) accounting for the extragalactic background .",
    "the sky background is well fitted by these models over the 0.3 - 7 kev energy range .",
    "we further verify the modeling by confirming that the amplitudes of the three components are consistent with independent measurements ( e.g. , willingale et al .",
    "2003 ; moretti et al .",
    "this background model is added to the source models when fitting the non - x - ray background - subtracted source spectra (   [ subsec : diffuse ] ) , with proper scaling of the sky area .    to assist the interpretation of the x - ray data",

    "we obtained the _ spitzer _",
    "irac images of ngc  5775 from the _ spitzer _ archive . to determine the net 8 @xmath11 m emission from dust ,",

    "the _ hst _ observations of ngc5775 were carried out on august 21 2005 with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) ( go#10416 ; pi : j.  rossa ) using the wide field channel ( wfc ) , which yields a @xmath12 field of view .",
    "the narrowband f658n filter observation was acquired in three _ hst _ orbits , while the broadband f625w image was acquired in one _ hst _ orbit .",
    "more observational details are given in rossa et al .",
    "hst_/acs data were calibrated using the _ calacs _ and _ multidrizzle _ packages .",
    "the former removes the various instrumental signatures , including bias correction and flat - fielding .",
    "the latter is used to correct for the geometric distortion of the acs camera and also performs cosmic ray rejection , and finally combines the individual images , obtained in the specific dither pattern .",
    "we also make use of data of irwin ( 1994 ) , h@xmath7 data of collins et al .",

    "an asymmetry of the diffuse emission is apparent in both the color and brightness relative to the major axis close to the disk .",
    "this asymmetry is clearly caused by the tilt of the galactic disk with its nearer side toward the northeast .",
    "aside from the x - ray emission from ngc  5775 itself , apparently weak x - ray emission features also appear to be associated with ic 1070 and ngc 5774 .",

    "in particular , ngc 5774 is located in the s2 chip that has a relatively lower sensitivity to the detection of soft x - rays .",
    "the appearance of the soft x - ray emission from this galaxy may be strongly perturbed by the tidal interaction with ngc 5775 ( lee et al .",

    "the fitted spectral model gives an absorbed ( intrinsic ) 0.3 - 7 kev luminosity of @xmath18 , putting source 76 in the class of ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .",

    "along the major axis , a dust lane , which is seen as a dark band in the r - band image , causes the soft x - ray absorption and hence the asymmetry in the soft x - ray intensity distribution .",

    "the 0.3 - 0.7 ( 0.7 - 1.5 ) kev scale heights are @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) in the southwestern side .",
    "accounting for the absorption effect , the intrinsic diffuse soft x - ray emission appears to be fairly symmetric relative to the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , imprints of large - scale extraplanar features are present ; the most noticeable are the southwest shell - like feature and the northeast blob ( fig . [",

    "these features produce local enhancements , although their significance is already diluted in fig .",

    "we extract spectra from the disk and halo regions in ngc 5775 for the diffuse x - ray emission ( fig .  [ pointsrc ] ) . the x - ray emission from regions northeast to the major axis of the galaxy is subject to the absorption by the tilted cool gas disk .",
    "the disk , in particular , is likely to be thicker at large galactocentric radii , responsible for the projected broad vertical distribution seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : x_multi]d .",
    "the near side of the disk can thus effectively absorb x - ray from the extraplanar x - ray emission from the northeast halo of the galaxy , but should be tilted largely away from sight - lines toward the southwest part of the halo .",
    "the projected in this latter part of the sky is located on the far side of the disk and should produce little absorption on the extraplanar x - ray emission .",
    "therefore , we collect the x - ray spectral data only from southwest halo and large height of northeast halo , as outlined in fig .  2 . the spectral analysis below ( e.g. , fig .",
    "8b ) and the spatial distribution of the extraplanar x - ray emission ( e.g. , fig .",
    "7 ) also show no indication for any absorption , in addition to that caused by the foreground galactic column density .",
    "we fit the disk and halo spectra with a thermal plasma model ( xspec mekal , with the abundance fixed at solar ) . at energies above 1.5 kev of the disk spectrum ,",
    "the residual counts spilled outside the source - removal regions ( especially the ulx ) and the unresolved point sources below our detection limit dominate , so we add a power law ( pl ) component to account for this effect ( a single mekal model gives very poor fit with reduced @xmath34 ) .",
    "intrinsic absorption is considered in the fit to the disk spectrum and the fitted value is consistent with the data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : profile_major ] ) . due to the limited statistics of high energy counts ,",
    "the photon index of the pl component can not be well constrained and is thus fixed to the value from the fit to the accumulated source spectrum (   [ subsec : ps ] ) .",
    "the fitted temperature of the diffuse plasma is @xmath40.2 kev in the disk .",
    "the thermal ( pl ) component of the disk spectrum gives an intrinsic 0.3 - 2 kev luminosity of @xmath35 .",
    "this model fit provides only a simple characterization of the spectral shape of the disk x - ray emission .",
    "the fitted individual model parameters probably do not have much physical meaning .",
    "for example , the power law component may contain a significant contribution from hotter diffuse gas that may be expected in the galactic disk .",
    "but the limited counting statistics of the data and the edge - on orientation of the galaxy make it impossible to significantly improve the analysis .",
    "since the stellar contribution in the halo is much lower than that in the disk , we do not include a pl component for the halo spectrum .",
    "but a single mekal model gives relatively poor fit with reduced @xmath36 , so we use a two - temperature model for the halo , again with abundances fixed at solar .",
    "the absorption is fixed at the foreground value .",
    "the 0.3 - 2 kev intrinsic luminosity of the low ( high ) temperature component is @xmath37 .",

    "the in - disk soft x - ray emission generally shows spatial similarities with star formation regions as traced by h@xmath7 , ir and/or radio emission .",
    "it is not surprising to have such similarities , since diffuse hot gas and unresolved young stellar objects , both closely related to star - forming regions , contribute to the soft x - ray emission .",
    "the extraplanar x - ray emission arises from truly diffuse hot gas .",

    "all components of the ism , except for , show a local minimum , indicating a low current star formation rate ( lee et al .",
    "2001 ) , possibly as a result of a previous star forming episode which has produced an in - disk disruption .",
    "f3 seems to be associated with an extraplanar h@xmath7 filament , within which several regions reside ( lee et al .",
    "2001 ) . together with the disk - halo connections discussed above ( cf .",
    "[ fig : x_hst.ps ] ) , they collectively indicate that local star forming regions away from the nucleus affect halo characteristics above and below the plane .",
    "in addition , however , these features are located near the boundaries of the so - called `` x - shape '' which designates conic structures ( marked in fig .",

    "( 2002 ) presented several disk / halo interaction models to interpret the multi - phase halo in ngc 253 .",
    "in their models , h@xmath7-emitting warm ionized gas can be produced through interaction between the outflow and the pre - existing gas in the halo , from the cooling of swept up outer shells , or simply by being dragged from the disk .",
    "soft x - ray emission can arise from shock heated halo gas or from the conductive interfaces or turbulent mixing layers between cold halo clouds and the tenuous , low emissivity , and hot superwind .",
    "some parameters of the two hot gas components are listed in table [ halopara ] .",
    "these parameters are inferred from the spectral fitting parameters listed in table [ specfitpara ] , with the assumption that the total filling factor of the hot gas is @xmath44 and the two hot gas components reach the pressure balance with each other .",
    "we expect that hot gas is produced mainly in the disk and then flows into the halo .",
    "the temperature of the gas depends on both the efficiencies of the mass loading as well as the radiative cooling and other energy dissipation processes ( e.g. , via cosmic rays and kinetic energy ) .",
    "because the mass efficiency of star formation is only @xmath45 and the remaining molecular gas is dispersed on a time scale of @xmath46 yrs , substantial massloading to hot gas is expected in recent star forming regions . with the presence of the dense gas , radiative and mechanical cooling can also be important .",
    "in contrast , the heating of gas by core - collapsed sne can be more efficient in older star formation regions ( @xmath47 yrs ; the upper limit corresponds to the lifetime of an 8@xmath48 star ) . therefore , gas in an ongoing or recent star forming region can be cooler  explaining the low - temperature component of the hot gas  than in those older star formation regions , which are probably responsible for the hotter component .",
    "the lower temperature hot gas can also be produced in the halo at interfaces between the hot gas outflow and the pre - existing cooler gas .",
    "radiative cooling generally has so long time scale for both hot gas components that it can not be very important in the halo ( table [ halopara ] ) , at least in the vicinity of the galactic disk .",
    "the rim - brightened soft x - ray - emitting bubble likely represents the reverse - shocked outflow in the interior of an outer cool shell ( strickland et al .",
    "2002 ) . this cool gas shell could be formed in or near the disk , and then expand into the halo driven by the high pressure interior . during the expansion of this cool shell",
    ", the magnetic field may play an important role in preventing the rayleigh - taylor instability which would break the shell , given that the magnetic pressure may be comparable with the thermal pressure of the halo hot gas ( see below ) .",
    "the northeast blob may be compared with a similar feature `` ridge '' detected in m 82 ( lehnert , heckman & weaver 1999 ) .",
    "the blob , elongated along the major axis instead of perpendicular to the major axis , is about twice as high as the m 82 ridge . given that ngc 5775 does not have as strong a superwind as detected in m 82 , and there is no clear sign of a cool gas counterpart for the blob , we speculate that it may represent a bulk of outflowing hot gas  an evolved outflowing wind bubble  generated in an early episode of massive star formation in the nuclear region of the galaxy .",
    "the relatively high concentration of the hot gas at such a large off - disk distance may be due to the confinement of a magnetic field loop , which would still be anchored in the disk .",
    "a magnetic field must be present because of the observed radio continuum counterpart .",
    "data of higher quality is needed to truly understand the nature of the blob .",
    "although a magneto - hydrodynamic model of the nuclear outflow is beyond the scope of this paper , we can still make some general statements about halo conditions .",
    "for example , the magnetic pressure in the halo can be estimated from @xmath49 ^ 2~f_b^{-4/7}\\rm~dyn~cm^{-2}$ ] , where @xmath50 is the magnetic field strength in units of @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the volume filling factor of the magnetic field . in this relation ,",
    "the magnetic field strength is assumed to have been determined from multi - frequency radio continuum maps , adopting an approximate energy equipartition between relativistic particles and the magnetic field .",
    "using the radio continuum and spectral index maps of duric et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and an appropriate geometric model ( see irwin et al . 1999 and irwin & saikia 2003 for examples ) we find a typical halo magnetic field strength of @xmath53 , implying @xmath54 for a unity filling factor , or higher if the filling factor is less than unity .",
    "the hot gas pressure in the halo is @xmath55 , derived from the hot gas parameters listed in table [ halopara ] .",
    "although we expect variation in these quantities and filling factors are unknown , it is reasonable to conclude that the magnetic field will be dynamically important in any outflow model .",
    "parker instabilities may also be present .",
    "observations of the current field configuration shows roughly vertical fields across the disk - halo interface ( see tllmann et al .",
    "2000 ) although the field configuration far from the plane has yet to be observationally determined .",
    "the feedback energy of the young and old stellar populations can be estimated from the ir ( heckman , armus & miley 1990 ) and k band ( mannucci et al . 2005 ) luminosity , which is @xmath56 in total .",
    "it is not easy to estimate the flow velocity of the hot gas , but we can adopt the sound speed in the higher temperature hot gas as an upper limit , which is @xmath57 . using this velocity ,",
    "the flowing time in the soft x - ray emitting halo is @xmath58 ( adopting an extension of the soft x - ray emitting halo to be 10 kpc ) .",
    "this corresponds to a total energy feedback @xmath59 , enough to support the soft x - ray emission and the energy of the hot gas .",
    "we have conducted a detailed _ chandra _ study of ngc  5775 and compared the results to multi - wavelength data obtained from _",
    "spitzer _ and _ hst _ as well as high resolution ground - based h@xmath7 , radio continuum and data .",
    "the main results are as follows :      large - scale diffuse x - ray emission is detected to an extent nearly 10 kpc above the galactic disk in an extended halo region .",
    "there are several prominent plume - like features detected in the halo indicating hot gas outflows from the disk , some of which are clearly associated with the in - disk star formation regions . in particular , a huge shell - like",
    "feature appears in the southern halo , and has a radius of nearly 5 kpc .",
    "the soft x - ray luminosity of this feature is @xmath60 in the 0.3 - 2 kev band . on the opposite side ,",
    "a large - scale `` blob '' is detected with a maximum projected distance @xmath3 from the galactic plane .",
    "our x - ray spectral analysis reveals that the halo hot gas can be decomposed into two characteristic components , with temperatures of about @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the total luminosity of the halo hot gas is @xmath5 .",
    "the multi - phase halo is energetically consistent with stellar feedback .",
    "current star formation with more mass loading may produce the lower temperature hot gas component , while recent and past star formation with less mass loading may be responsible for the higher temperature component .",
    "the soft x - ray shell - like feature likely represents an outflowing wind bubble from the galactic central region .",
    "the northeast blob may be an evolved version of such a bubble that is still confined by strong magnetic field .",
    "we find that the magnetic pressure is comparable to the hot gas pressure , and will therefore play an important role in the evolution of a multi - phase halo .",
    "we have obtained an `` x - ray - star formation '' relation for sub - galactic scale star formation regions in this disk - wide star forming galaxy , and this relation is consistent with that inferred from the integrated galactic properties .",
