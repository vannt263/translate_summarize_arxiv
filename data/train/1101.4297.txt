    "two important quantities in the description of a many - electron system are ( i ) the position - dependent exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy per particle @xmath1 , which yields the total xc energy functional of density - functional theory ( dft):@xcite @xmath2=\\int d{\\bf r}\\,n({\\bf r})\\,\\varepsilon_{xc}({\\bf r } ) , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] and ( ii ) the xc potential @xmath3 entering the kohn - sham ( ks ) equation of dft , which is defined as the functional derivative of the xc energy functional : @xmath4\\over \\delta n({\\bf r})}. \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] rigorously , the position - dependent xc energy @xmath1 can be obtained as the interaction between an electron at @xmath5 and the coupling - constant averaged charge @xmath6 of its xc hole , by using the so - called adiabatic - connection formula.@xcite on the other hand , the ks xc potential can be obtained by solving the so - called sham - schlter integral equation,@xcite which relates @xmath3 to the electron self - energy of many - body theory@xcite and which by using the hartree - fock self - energy reduces to the integral equation of the exact - exchange optimized effective potential ( oep ) scheme.@xcite instead , in most of the existing electronic - structure calculations these quantities have been calculated by invoking the local - density approximation ( lda)@xcite and its semilocal variants.@xcite it is well known , however , that these approximations fail to reproduce the expected image - like asymptotic behaviour of both @xmath1 and @xmath3 at metal surfaces,@xcite an issue of great importance for the interpretation of a variety of surface - sensitive experiments such as low - energy electron diffraction ( leed),@xcite scanning tunneling microscopy,@xcite and inverse and two - photon photoemission spectroscopy.@xcite    the issue of the asymptotic behavior of the xc energy and potential at metal surfaces has been the source of considerable controversy over the years.@xcite one of the first attempts to describe @xmath7 and @xmath8 at points far outside a metal surface was made by gunnarsson _",
    "et al._.@xcite it was argued that as the distance @xmath9 from the metal surface grows large enough to make the limiting case of a point charge outside a grounded conductor applicable,@xcite ( i ) there are no exchange contributions to order @xmath10 and ( ii ) correlations are the same as for a classical point charge , thus @xmath11 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the ks xc potential @xmath8 at large distances outside a metal surface was examined by sham ( for a semi - infinite jellium)@xcite and by eguiluz _ at al . _",
    "( for jellium slabs)@xcite from the sham - shlter integral equation . both sham@xcite and eguiluz _",
    "et al._@xcite concluded that the hartree - fock self - energy yields a @xmath12 behavior of the ks exchange potential @xmath13 for large @xmath9 , while the correlation self - energy yields the image - like @xmath14 limit , thereby confirming the long - standing believe that the image - potential structure is a pure coulomb - correlation effect .",
    "this result disagreed , however , with the semi - infinite - jellium calculations reported by solamatin and sahni.@xcite these authors concluded that @xmath13 does contribute to the image - like asymptotic structure of @xmath8 ; they also reached the conclusion that in the asymptotic region @xmath15 [ or , equivalently , half the so - called slater potential @xmath16 and @xmath13 coincide , but later nastos  @xcite argued that the ks exchange potential should contain the entire slater potential .",
    "most recently , qian and sahni@xcite employed the plasmon - pole approximation for the correlation part of the self - energy to conclude that the asymptote of the ks xc potential @xmath8 is for metallic densities approximately twice as large as the commonly accepted @xmath14 form and discussed the consequent implications of this result on the theory of image states.@xcite    in an attempt to settle the issue of the long - range behavior of exchange and correlation outside a solid , fully self - consistent exact - exchange calculations of @xmath17 and @xmath13 have been carried out recently for both jellium slabs@xcite and a semi - infinite jellium.@xcite for _ jellium slabs _ , it has been proven analytically and numerically that in the vacuum region far away from the surface @xmath18@xcite and @xmath19,@xcite which is equivalent to the well - known results @xmath20 and @xmath21 that hold in the case of _ localized _ finite systems like atoms and molecules.@xcite for _ the semi - infinite jellium _ , self - consistent exact - exchange calculations indicate that ( i ) the exchange energy per particle has an image - like asymptotic behavior of the form @xmath22,@xcite with a density - dependent coefficient @xmath23 that differs from the jellium - slab @xmath24 coefficient and coincides with the analytical asymptote obtained in ref .",
    ", but ( ii ) @xmath13 decays as @xmath25,@xcite this dominant ( positive ! ) contribution _ not _ arising from the slater potential @xmath26 .    in this paper , we go a step further to report benchmark well - defined self - consistent jellium - slab calculations of @xmath7 that include correlation at the level of the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) at least .",
    "our calculations are based on a combination of the formally - exact adiabatic - connection - fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( acfdt)@xcite with either time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft)@xcite or an inhomogeneous singwi - tosi - land - sjlander ( istls ) approach.@xcite as pointed out above , the asymptotic forms of the exact - exchange energy @xmath27 outside jellium slabs and a semi - infinite jellium have been found to be qualitatively different,@xcite which is due to the fact that for asymptotic positions of the electron the exact - exchange ( pauli ) hole is delocalized and spread throughout the crystal ; @xcite but the coulomb hole screens out the delocalized pauli hole , yielding an xc hole that is localized at the surface.@xcite this results in an image - like asymptotic form of the position - dependent xc energy @xmath7 of jellium slabs that converges quickly to the semi - infinite limit .",
    "we find numerically that this image - like behavior is close to the classical image potential @xmath0 .",

    "the jellium slab is invariant under translations in the @xmath29 plane , so the xc energy per particle at @xmath9 , defined as the interaction between a given electron at @xmath9 and the coupling - constant averaged charge of its xc hole , can be obtained as follows ( unless stated otherwise , atomic units are used throughout ) : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a wavevector parallel to the surface , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 represent the two - dimensional ( 2d ) fourier transforms of the coulomb interaction @xmath34 and the coupling - constant averaged charge @xmath35 of the xc hole at @xmath36 due to the presence of an electron at @xmath9.@xcite    the _ exact _ xc - hole charge density , which is related to the pair - distribution function and the static structure factor of many - body theory , can be obtained from the density - response function of linear - response theory through the use of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , leading to the so - called adiabatic - connection - fluctuation - dissipation formula . for a system that is invariant in two directions , we find : @xmath37 , \\label{e7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 represents the electron density and @xmath39 is the 2d fourier transform of the interacting density - response function @xmath40 at the coupling strength @xmath41 .    if the interacting @xmath39 entering eq .",
