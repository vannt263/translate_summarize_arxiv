    "lithium is of fundamental astrophysical importance .",
    "this fragile light element is quickly destroyed in stars when exposed to @xmath8 k , making it useful in studying matter transport in stars and providing observational feedback on our understanding of stellar structure and evolution ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , stellar li abundances have cosmological applications .",
    "combining the a(li ) on the usual scale where the logarithmic number abundance of hydrogen is given by @xmath9 . ] in old stars with a ) accurate stellar evolution models to account for stellar destruction , and b ) accurate chemical evolution models to account for galactic production , should lead to the primordial a(li ) , which provides constraints on big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite and an independent check on cosmological parameters determined by wmap @xcite .",
    "however , the vulnerability of li to destruction that makes it a good probe of stellar interiors also complicates the derivation of _ initial _ halo dwarf a(li)our best connection to the big bang a(li ) .    the astrophysical usefulness of li ,",
    "therefore , strongly depends on having correct stellar models that accurately trace the _ in situ _ history of li .",
    "standard stellar models ( ssms ) suggest that , for stars of about 1.2@xmath10 , the observed surface a(li ) can go down only , a ) during the early pre - main sequence ( pms ) when some of the interior li is actually destroyed , and b ) during subgiant evolution as the deepening surface convection zone ( scz ) dilutes it .",
    "standard theory predicts no surface li depletion during the main sequence ( ms ) .",
    "more specifically , since li burns at relatively low temperatures , anytime the scz reaches deep enough into the star s interior , visible li depletion will occur at the surface .",
    "this occurs during the pms phase and , for stars of around 1.2@xmath10 , the scz is not deep enough during the ms to carry li into the interior regions where it can be burned appreciably .",
    "even during late pms convective burning , such depletion is minimal . for a 1.2@xmath10 star with [ fe / h]@xmath11 ,",
    "the maximum expected depletion on both the ms and the pms is @xmath12 dex @xcite .",
    "therefore , little li depletion in stars of this mass ( or higher ) is expected on the pms , and virtually none on the ms , based on the predictions from ssms @xcite .    in contradistinction ,",
    "striking li ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and be ; ) depletion is observed in disk ms stars with @xmath13 k. in the hyades , @xcite discovered that stars with @xmath14 k were depleted by @xmath15 dex as compared to stars merely 200300 k hotter or cooler .",
    "this abrupt f - star li(be ) depletion ( the li dip ) occurs mainly _ during the ms _ , since much younger clusters such as the pleiades ( @xmath16 myr ) show a nearly flat li-@xmath4  relation @xcite .",
    "the li dip presents a challenge to ssms , which predict negligible li depletion on the ms , and casts doubt on their ability to either predict or backtrack li abundances to initial values . instead",
    ", stellar models are required that can explain the li dip accurately by modeling li abundances over a star s lifetime . a number of refinements to ssms",
    "have been proposed to explain the li dip @xcite , but here we focus on rotationally - induced mixing ( rim ) @xcite .",
    "rim models propose that a loss of angular momentum , as stars spin down on the ms , could cause slow mixing between the photosphere and the hotter denser region beneath the scz , resulting in the depletion of surface li .    to test this theory",
    ", @xcite suggest that li abundances of short - period tidally - locked binaries ( sptlbs ) be measured .",
    "rim and stellar tidal theory @xcite together predict that a sptlb loses most of its angular momentum during the very early pms , when interior densities and temperatures are too low to burn li .",
    "hence , lacking significant angular momentum to lose and drive future requisite mixing , neither does it suffer ms li depletion responsible for the li dip .",
    "thus , one method to test if angular momentum transfer is indeed the causal force behind the li dip is to find sptlbs whose ages and temperatures should place them in the li dip , and measure their li .",
    "a value of a(li ) higher than otherwise similar li dip stars would support rim models .",
    "v505 persei , a pop i intermediate - age short - period binary system , is made up of two f stars of nearly equal mass , radius , and @xmath4   @xcite .",
    "both masses , @xmath4 , and @xmath17 day period make them good candidates to test if an early pms loss of angular momentum can later preserve li compared to otherwise similar non - sptlb stars .",
    "we measure the a(li)s of v505 per and compare them in the a(li ) versus zero - age ms ( zams ) @xmath4  plane with stars of intermediate - age open clusters , showing in the process that the components of v505 per have a(li)s higher than single stars of their zams @xmath4 .",
    "high - resolution ( @xmath18 ) spectroscopy of hd 14384 was obtained on 30 and 31 august 1997 using keck / hires .",
    "three nightly exposures totalled 8 and 5.5 minutes on the first and second nights , respectively .",
    "debiasing , flat - fielding , scattered light removal , order tracing / extraction , and wavelength calibration were carried out with standard routines in iraf .    given the short integration spans relative to the 4.2 d period , we co - added the 3 nightly spectra .",
    "the resulting @xmath19 continuum level poisson snr / pixel is 850 and 580 on the first and second nights .",
    "spectra were fit with a low order polynomial to perform a continuum normalization .",
    "figure 1 shows our co - added , normalized spectra .",
    "the physically similar components of the sb2 are distinguished and identified both by slight differences in the strengths of the @xmath20 cai feature and the relative doppler shifts expected from the orbital ephemeris of @xcite .",
    "the relative doppler shifts of the components in each night s coadded spectrum , needed for the spectrum synthesis described next , were measured from the centroids of the cai features .",
    "to derive li and fe abundances , we conducted spectrum synthesis of the @xmath216707 region to account for the line blending between the stellar components .",
    "such synthesis requires knowledge of @xmath4 , @xmath22 , radius ( @xmath23 ) , and microturbulent velocity ( @xmath24 ) of each star .",
    "the first of three of these parameters are taken from @xcite , who determine radii and associated uncertainties from a @xcite code - based solution with updated model stellar atmospheres @xcite ; these radii agree with alternate solutions derived from the radial velocities and @xmath25 photometry alone to within 0.05 @xmath26 , which is well within their stated @xmath27 @xmath26 uncertainty adopted here .",
    "the @xmath4values and uncertainties of @xcite , @xmath28 and @xmath29 k for the a and b components , are derived from multiparameter @xmath30 fitting of 700  of their own high - resolution ( @xmath3120,000 ) spectra against synthetic spectra grids .",
    "encouragingly , the @xmath4  differences of the components they derive as part of the orbital solutions agree to within 18 k of the spectroscopically - derived value .",
    "the @xcite masses and radii yield @xmath32 for both components .",
    "we determined @xmath24 ( 1.73 and 1.70 km s@xmath33 ) using the @xmath4- and @xmath34-dependent calibration of @xcite .",
    "we note , though , the derived li abundances are insensitive to the value of log @xmath35 and @xmath24 . .",
    "while [ fe / h ] was eventually determined from a comparison of the observed and synthetic spectra , we adopted an initial metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath36 from the photometric determination of @xcite .",
    "we used the @xmath4 , log g , and [ fe / h ] values to interpolate model atmospheres from the grids of @xcite .",
    "moog was used to create a synthetic spectrum for each star using the @xmath19 linelist of @xcite .",
    "the spectra were smoothed by convolving with a gaussian with fwhm measured from clean , weak lines in the observed spectra .",
    "each component s synthetic spectrum was doppler shifted and then combined , using the product of the square radii and the planck function value at 6707 ( a pseudo - monochromatic luminosity ) as a weighting factor .",
    "this correction for flux dilution is appropriate for the first night s observations ( orbital phase of 0.74 ) since each star s undiminished flux contributes to the spectrum .",
    "the orbital phase ( 0.97 ) of second night s observations places the system on the cusp of primary eclipse ; however , the eclipses are very sharp , and the total system flux diminishment in @xmath37 at this phase is @xmath380.01 mag of the @xmath39 mag total at primary eclipse .    finally , we compared the synthetic spectra to the observed spectra using @xmath40 minimization methods .",
    "we used the @xmath41 line to determine [ fe / h ] , forcing both stars to have an assumed identical fe abundance .",
    "once a best - fit value of [ fe / h ] had been determined , we moved on to a(li ) , which was allowed to differ in the two components to allow for possible differing li depletion in the two stars .",
    "these synthetic spectra are compared to the observed data in figure 1 .",
    "the analysis of the first night s data yielded [ fe / h]@xmath42 .",
    "the quoted error is due to the 1@xmath43 level fitting uncertainties alone ; even so , our metallicity estimate is in good agreement with [ m / h]@xmath44 from @xcite .",
    "the metallicity from the second night was not calculated due to the unfortunate placement of the @xmath41 fei feature in the secondary star with a detector / reduction artifact that can be seen in figure 1 ; in carrying out the li syntheses , we assumed the [ fe / h ] value from the first night s data .",
    "the li syntheses ( figure 1 ) yield average a(li ) of @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the primary and secondary components , respectively .",
    "while the best - fit li abundances differ by only a few hundredths of a dex , the larger quoted uncertainties in a(li ) are dominated by uncertainties in the continuum location .",
    "contributions from fitting uncertainties in the @xmath40 minimization and @xmath4  uncertainties amount to only @xmath47 dex and @xmath48 dex , respectively ; contributions from uncertainties in @xmath49 and log @xmath35 are similarly small or smaller and are ignored .",
    "abundance uncertainties arising from uncertainties in the flux dilution factors of each component , which in turn arise from uncertainties in @xmath4  and the @xcite stellar radii , are @xmath50 dex .",
    "interpreting the a(li ) of our sptlb components requires that they be placed in the context of the li dip morphology defined by other single ( or non - sptlb ) stars . in her comparisons of the li dip in various open clusters",
    ", @xcite found that the @xmath4  at which the li dip occurs varies based on metallicity , but that the zams @xmath4  at which the li dip is located does not ; this provides a means by which the li dip morphology of different populations of disk stars can be compared .",
    "additionally , @xcite found that the morphology of the cool side of the li dip is age - dependent .",
    "some evidence suggests that the li dip may begin to form as early as an age of 150 myr @xcite or even 100 myr @xcite .",
    "clearly , comparing our stars with bona fide li dip stars requires knowledge of our sptlb components zams @xmath4  and age .    for consistency",
    ", we followed the approach of @xcite to find the zams @xmath4  of each star by looking at differences implied by isochrones ( and their assumed color transformations ) between our stars in their current evolutionary state and on the zams .",
    "this required that we first determine the age of our sptlb stars , which we did by placing the components in the radius versus mass plane and comparing these locations with sequences from [ m / h]@xmath51 yonsei - yale isochrones @xcite . as shown in figure 2 , this implies an age of @xmath52 gyr for the system ; the majority of the age uncertainty comes from uncertainty in the radii estimates .",
    "we then used the yonsei - yale isochrones with the green color - temperature relations , which are also employed by the revised yale isochrones @xcite used by @xcite , to determine the difference between the @xmath4  at 1.15 gyr and on the zams .",
    "this @xmath4   difference was then applied to our current @xmath4  value from @xcite , yielding zams @xmath4  values of 6483 and 6432k for the primary and secondary components .",
    "the @xmath53 level uncertainties in our interpolation of the @xmath4-mass relations of the isochrones are @xmath54 k.    figure 3 presents the li - zams @xmath4  diagram containing :  the v505 per components ; the literature data reanalyzed by @xcite for the open cluster ngc752 , having a @xmath55 gyr age @xcite and [ fe / h]@xmath1 @xcite ; the li data for the 1.75 gyr , [ fe / h]@xmath56 cluster ngc3680  @xcite ; and the li data of @xcite for the 650 myr [ fe / h]@xmath57 hyades cluster .",
    "we determined the ngc3680  object masses using a legendre polynomial relation to map the dual @xmath58 magnitude and mass abscissas of figure 4 of @xcite .",
    "we then used the yonsei - yale isochrones as described above to determine the @xmath4   difference between the zams and at 1.75 gyr at a given mass .",
    "this difference was then applied to the at2009 @xmath4  values to yield zams @xmath4  values .",
    "if the v505 per @xmath6 values and uncertainties of @xcite are reliable , and if the _ relative _ uncertainties in the to - zams @xmath6 corrections for the v505 per components compared to those of the open cluster comparison stars are not several times the size of the corrections themselves ( @xmath59 k for our binary components and @xmath60 k for similar mass stars in the slightly older ngc 752 cluster ) , then figure 3 indicates that both our sptlb components are positioned inside the li dip that is well defined by the hyades data ( or those of the or praesepe data not shown here ; see figure 12 of * ? ? ?",
    "the larger li abundances in the v505 per components compared to nearly all of the younger and more metal - rich hyades data in figure 3 is especially notable given the metallicity difference and the age difference , which we discuss in turn , between the two .",
    "first , comparisons of the v505 per li abundances with those in cluster stars are most meaningful if some account of initial li abundance differences can be made .",
    "an empirical approach to parameterize galactic disk li production in terms of fe production is to use the upper envelope of the li - fe relation exhibited by large samples of field stars .",
    "the field star data over the range @xmath61 in figure 7 of @xcite suggest an initial li - to - fe ( logarithmic by number ) relation in the local disk having slope @xmath0 dex / dex . for comparison , the galactic chemical evolution model in figure 9 of @xcite",
    "produces a slope of @xmath62 dex / dex over the same [ fe / h ] range , though this slope may be too small since it is unable to reproduce the initial solar li abundance .",
    "indeed , determinations of the slope of the li - to - fe relation using li abundances on the g - dwarf li peak of various open clusters are significantly larger at 1.4 dex / dex @xcite and 1.0 dex / dex @xcite .",
    "the hyades and praesepe have super - solar metallicities : [ fe / h]@xmath63 to @xmath64 @xcite . the local disk field and",
    "@xcite open cluster li - fe relation thus implies the initial hyades and praesepe li abundances were a factor of 2 larger than for the v505 per components ; the @xcite open cluster li - fe relation implies initial li abundances a factor of 2.6 larger than for the v505 per components .",
    "accounting for initial li differences in this way makes the observed present - day difference between v505 per and hyades li abundances even more remarkable .",
    "second , the red side of the li dip is known to flatten with increasing age , which may be due to increasing li depletion in the dip stars with age @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , despite their older age , our sptlb components exhibit li abundances a factor of 2 _ larger _ than nearly all li detections or upper limits at similar zams @xmath4 in the younger ( @xmath65650 myr ) hyades and praesepe . once reaching the v505 per age , stars on the red side of the dip in these clusters",
    "would presumably have even lower li abundance than at present .",
    "figure 3 also compares v505 per with stars of more similar [ fe / h ] : those in ngc752   and ngc 3680 .",
    "the a(li ) of our sptlb components are a factor of 2 - 5 larger than the upper limits for the ngc752  and ngc 3680 li dip stars ( one 3680 star on the steep blue side of the dip is within the error bar of our primary component ) .",
    "note that @xcite argue that their high - resolution spectroscopy of solar - type dwarfs in ngc752  suggests [ fe / h]@xmath66 for this cluster , 0.15 dex larger than the canonical value quoted by @xcite .",
    "if so , the above discussion of the initial li abudnance versus [ fe / h ] relation suggests an even larger difference between the li depletion factors of our sptlb components and the ngc752  li dip stars .    finally , it is important to recall that the preservation of li by sptlbs occurs if angular momentum loss occurs sufficiently early during the pms , when interior temperatures and densities are too low to burn li .",
    "this early synchronization is predicted to occur in systems with periods below some critical period that is a function of stellar mass and metallicity @xcite .",
    "the models of @xcite for galactic disk stars of mass 1.2m@xmath67 indicate this critical period is 6 days .",
    "the 4.2d period of v505 per falls under this critical period , though the 1.25 and 1.27m@xmath67 components slightly exceed the 1.2m@xmath67 maximum mass considered by the modeling of @xcite .",
    "the hyades sptlb vb 34 resides within the blue region of the hyades li gap , but does not clearly demonstrate a li abundance larger than similar single stars ( see , e.g. , figure 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "however , yonsei - yale isochrones ( [ fe / h]@xmath57 , 650 myr for the hyades ; [ fe / h]@xmath51 , 1.15gyr for v505 per ) indicate that the vb 34 masses are 0.20 - 0.23m@xmath67 larger than for v505 per ; thus , the 3.1d period of vb 34 may not be below a necessary critical period for its larger mass components .",
    "lithium is important for probing stellar interiors and evolution .",
    "it can be used to study transport of matter in the stars , galactic chemical evolution , and bbn .",
    "such uses depend heavily on accurate predictions of li abundance evolution within stars .",
    "it is known that ssms are unable to explain the li dip in disk mid - f dwarfs .",
    "modified stellar models that include the action of rotationally - induced slow mixing can explain the li dip as the result of slow li mixing in stars that are currently undergoing angular momentum loss and are sufficiently massive that interior temperatures and densities are sufficiently large to burn li as a result of such mixing .",
    "although other types of physical mechanisms have also been proposed as explanations of the li dip , including diffusion , mass loss , and other types of mixing , a variety of observational evidence favors , often quite strongly , the rim - type models over other mechanisms .",
    "this evidence includes ( but is not limited to ) : a ) the li / be depletion correlation where _ both _ elements are depleted , but li more severely @xcite b ) the be / b depletion correlation @xcite c ) subgiants in m67 revealing the size and shape of the ( ms ) stellar preservation region as they evolve out of the cool side of the li dip @xcite d ) and the early ms formation of the li dip .    here , we present an independent observational test of the rim explanation of the li dip .",
    "the @xmath6 values and uncertainties of @xcite indicate that the components of the mildly metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath68 ) intermediate - age ( @xmath69gyr ) short - period tidally - locked binary v505 per both reside in the popi li dip defined by open cluster observations ( assuming the differential @xmath70 k to - zams @xmath6 corrections suggested by isochrones for our stars relative to the younger hyades and older ngc 752 and ngc 3680 clusters are not , in fact , an order of magnitude larger ) .",
    "if angular momentum loss in such a system occurred very early during the pre - main sequence phase , then it would suffer no or reduced rim during the ms compared to non - sptlb stars occupying the li dip region ; as a result , the v505 per components would exhibit larger li abundances than otherwise similar stars in the li gap .",
    "we find that the v505 per components li abundances are at least 2 - 5 times larger than both : a ) the li upper limits in the @xmath71gyr and similarly mildly metal - poor ( fe / h@xmath68 and @xmath72 ) clusters ngc752  and 3680 , and b ) the upper limits and li detections in the younger metal - rich hyades and praesepe clusters .",
    "if there exists an initial li - fe relation of positive slope , as field star data and open cluster observations and galactic chemical evolution models each independently suggest , and initial li abundances indeed scale with [ fe / h ] in the recent disk , then the li overabundance of v505 per is even more dramatic in the case of the younger clusters ( which presumably started with a higher initial li abundance ) and perhaps in ngc752  if one assumes the higher [ fe / h ] value of @xcite .",
    "our results suggest , independently , that angular momentum evolution on the ms is responsible for the li dip , confirming the conclusions drawn from the variety of observational evidence listed above , involving both field and cluster dwarfs .",
    "sptlbs with higher - than - normal li have been found in the 650-myr old hyades ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see soderblom et al .",
    "1990 for a related idea ) , the 4.5gyr - old m67 @xcite , and in other contexts @xcite ; and , significantly , sptlbs have _ normal _ li in clusters , such as the pleiades , which are too young for much rim - related depletion to have occurred @xcite .",
    "our results for v505 per complement these previous findings in that the v505 per sptlb stars are the hottest high - li sptlbs discovered so far , and are indeed very close to the limiting @xmath4  beyond which the models of @xcite can no longer synchronize both components sufficiently early during the pre - ms to prevent li destruction .",
    "the scz of hotter sptlbs is too shallow and the their hayashi paths too short for the components to grab onto each other sufficiently effectively so as to cause tidal locking during that same evolutionary phase .    while the li abundances in our v505 per components likely reflect some li depletion from a plausible initial abundance in the range @xmath73 , which is not unexpected ( see section 2.2.1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they nevertheless suggest that early tidal circularization can be efficient in mid - f stars in the li dip and mitigate the effects of rim on li depletion .",
    "identification of additional li dip sptlbs , analysis of their a(li ) , and comparison with that of single stars of similar li dip position , metallicity , and age would be a profitable means to extend these conclusions ."
