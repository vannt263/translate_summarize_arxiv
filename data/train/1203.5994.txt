    "<S> yields the jaynes cummings model ( jcm ) @xcite , which is valid when the detuning between the qubit transition frequency @xmath0 and the resonator frequency @xmath1 is negligible @xmath2 and the coupling between the qubit and oscillator is weak @xmath3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is an excellent approximation in the case of cavity qed where typical coupling strengths are of order @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the jcm can be extended to incorporate tunnelling , and has provided an adequate description of experiments for decades , but a new era of experiments are pushing beyond its boundaries in terms of both coupling and detuning . </S>",
    "<S> circuit qed experiments couple superconducting qubits to lc and waveguide resonators , allowing coupling strengths up to @xmath5 , recently enabling demonstrations of the breakdown of the jcm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> superconducting qubits coupled to nanomechanical resonators ( nr ) generally have more modest coupling strengths @xcite , but combined with large detuning they could also operate outside the validity of the jcm @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian for the rabi model can be decomposed into three parts : @xmath6 the qubit , atom or two level system is described by : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the pauli spin operators . </S>",
    "<S> they describe a two level system with an energy splitting @xmath10 and a spontaneous tunnelling between the states at a rate @xmath11 . in isolation </S>",

    "<S> the hamiltonian for the interaction between the two is : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the coupling strength between the qubit and oscillator .    </S>",
    "<S> recent experimental progress has sparked a renewed theoretical interest in extending solutions of ( [ eqn : hambreak ] ) beyond the rwa . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , a change of basis prior to applying the rwa leads to a generalised rwa that should be valid outside the very weak coupling limit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is limited to the case of @xmath18 . as an alternative approach , </S>",
    "<S> van vleck perturbation theory @xcite has been used to investigate the dynamics in the ultra strong ( @xmath19 ) coupling regime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach contains the splitting and tunnelling elements , but it is perturbative in the latter and fails to recover the jcm in the weak coupling limit . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is therefore more applicable to circuit qed , rather than the more modest couplings achieved in cooper pair box ( cpb ) coupled to nr systems .    </S>",
    "<S> an analytic expression for the eigenspectrum of the full rabi model was very recently found by braak @xcite , a surprising and significant result for such a long standing problem . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is too early to tell how much this solution can reveal about the physical properties and dynamics of the system . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to solving the model braak proved that it is non - integrable i.e. the time - dependence of important properties can not be found in closed form . </S>",
    "<S> there is therefore still a need for approximate results governing areas of particular experimental interest .    in order to simplify the expression and extend the validity of the approximations that we will subsequently describe into the strong coupling regime , we first perform a ` polaron ' transformation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this unitary hamiltonian transformation ( @xmath20 ) is equivalent to dressing qubit excitations with the vibrational modes to form quasi - particles called polarons . with @xmath21 and @xmath22 </S>",

    "<S> we have employed the born approximation , i.e. we have assumed that the vibrational mode and the qubit states can be factored at all times .    </S>",
    "<S> physically , this corresponds to an oscillator that thermalises on a timescale faster than that characteristic of the qubit dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> the equations of motion take the form of a system of integro - differential equations involving the bosonic correlation function and its complex conjugate . </S>",

    "<S> it is sufficient to solve these two equations alone because from their solutions the behaviour of the other density matrix elements can be trivially derived .    to obtain expressions for the dynamics of eqns ( [ eqn : rsol1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : rsol2 ] ) in the time domain we need to find the laplace transform of the bosonic correlation and its conjugate , solve and then take the inverse laplace transform of the equations . </S>",

    "<S> in this form the correlation function can be laplace transformed trivially . </S>",
    "<S> the bessel function weighting of the series means it converges very rapidly , in fact only a few terms of the series need to be retained to accurately capture the dynamics . for experimentally relevant parameters ( i.e.  low temperatures and moderate to strong coupling ) </S>",

    "<S> physically this corresponds to retaining only interactions that conserve the total phonon number in the oscillator , thus complementing the underlying born approximation , which assumes the oscillator remains in thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> including only the dominant zeroth term in the series allows the equations ( [ eqn : rsol1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : rsol2 ] ) to be inverse laplace transformed : @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 . from eqn ( [ eqn : rho3 ] ) we can see that the presence of the oscillator alters the tunnelling rate by a factor @xmath62 , essentially corresponding to a temperature dependent ac stark shift on the qubit due to the presence of the single oscillator mode @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous work our expression is not confined to the weak coupling or large detunning limit , but still takes a surprisingly simple closed form .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig:1 ] shows a comparison of the dynamics predicted using these expressions and a numerically exact approach . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are obtained by imposing a truncation of the oscillator hilbert space at a point where the dynamics have converged and any higher modes have an extremely low occupation probability . </S>",
    "<S> our zeroth order approximation proves to be unexpectedly powerful , giving accurate dynamics well into the strong coupling regime ( @xmath63 ) and even beyond this it still captures the dominant oscillatory behaviour , see figure [ fig:1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> stronger coupling increases the numerical weight of higher frequency terms in the series , causing a modulation of the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the approximation starts to break down at ( @xmath64 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the equations ( [ eqn : rho0 ] ) and ( [ eqn : rho1 ] ) are obviously unable to capture the higher frequency modulations to the dynamics or any potential long time phenomena like collapse and revival , but these are unlikely to be resolvable in experiments in any case . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , it is worth pointing out that even in this strong coupling case the base frequency of the qubit dynamics is still adequately captured by our single term approximation .    our methodology can be used to predict dynamics of nanomechanical resonators connected to either quantum dots or superconducting qubits . </S>",
    "<S> the criterion for the single term approximation to be valid is readily met by current experiments such as those presented in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and their parameters yield near perfect agreement between numerical and analytic results . </S>",
    "<S> most experiments operate in a regime where the qubit dynamics are not greatly perturbed by the presence of the oscillator , which has a much lower frequency ( @xmath65 ghz , @xmath66 ghz ) . in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] , we chose @xmath67 mhz , because this better demonstrates the effect of the oscillator on the qubit . </S>",
    "<S> these parameters can be achieved experimentally using the same qubit design but with an oscillating voltage applied to the cpb bias gate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we stress the accuracy of our method is not restricted to this regime .     main panel : comparison of dynamics calculated from truncating ( [ sin5 ] ) at @xmath68 ( red ) and a numerically exact approach ( blue ) . </S>",
    "<S> lower left : fourier transform of the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> lower right : the numerical weight of the @xmath69 term in the series expansion of ( [ sin5 ] ) , showing there are still only two dominant frequencies at @xmath70 and @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> parameters : @xmath72 , @xmath55 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . ]    including extra terms in the series expansion ( [ sin5 ] ) makes the time dependence of the qubit dynamics analytically unwieldy , because the rational function form of the series leads to a complex interdepence of the positions of the poles in ( [ eqn : rsol1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the values of the parameters are known the series can truncated at ( @xmath78 ) to give an efficient numerical method to obtain more accurate dynamics , extending the applicability of our approach beyond the regime described by ( [ eqn : crit ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] , where the dynamics are clearly dominated by two frequencies  an effect that could obviously never be captured by a single term approximation . </S>",
    "<S> there is a qualitative agreement between the many terms expansion and full numerical solution , particularly at short times . </S>",
    "<S> we would not expect a perfect agreement in this case because the simulations are of the dynamics in the large tunnelling regime ( @xmath79 ) , and the polaron transform makes the master equation perturbative in this parameter . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , the rapid convergence of the series is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] ; @xmath80 is sufficient to calculate @xmath37 and @xmath38 with an accuracy only limited by the underlying born approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry of the amplitudes of the terms in the series expansion of ( [ sin5 ] ) is due to the exponential functions in the series .     </S>",
    "<S> demonstration of qubit thermometry : @xmath81 is the temperature supplied to the numerical simulation of the system and @xmath82 is the temperature that would be predicted by fitting oscillations with frequency ( [ eqn : rho3 ] ) to it . </S>",
    "<S> the blue line is the data and red line shows the effect of a 10khz error in the frequency measurement ; the grey dashed line serves as a guide to the eye . </S>",
    "<S> the lower inset shows the variation of the qubit frequency @xmath0 with temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the upper inset shows the dependence of the absolute error in the prediction against the signal length ( see text ) . </S>",
    "<S> other parameters are : @xmath54 ghz , @xmath83 ghz , @xmath84 , @xmath85 mhz ]    we now discuss the application of our model system to the measurement of the temperature of an oscillator by observing the coupled qubit . </S>",
    "<S> we picture a situation in which the qubit oscillation frequency @xmath0 is the measured quantity . </S>",
    "<S> the tunnelling , coupling strength and energy splitting are usually within the control of the experimentalist ( or are at least known constants ) , and this yields the possibility of using the measured @xmath0 to estimate the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> a related idea was recently used in the calibration of a seminal resonator experiment @xcite to verify that the oscillator was in its ground state ( a critical part of the work ) . in that case , the authors used a comparison of numerical results for different occupation numbers @xmath86 with the measured population in the excited state of the qubit after a certain interaction time . </S>",
    "<S> a theoretical study of the same approach was preformed in @xcite , where the system was described by the jcm without a tunnelling term . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , we here propose that simple analytic expressions for the qubit dynamics that are valid beyond the weak coupling regime , like our own , can be used to directly measure the temperature and hence @xmath86 of the oscillator , simply by observing the effective qubit rabi frequency @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig:3 ] demonstrates this idea , showing that by measuring @xmath0 and fitting it to our expression ( [ eqn : rho3 ] ) , we can obtain submilli - kelvin precision in the experimentally relevant regime of 20 - 55 mk . at low temperatures the single term frequency plateaus , causing the accuracy to break down . in the higher temperature limit </S>",
    "<S> , we also see a deviation from the diagonal , this is to be expected as we leave the regime of validity described by ( [ eqn : crit ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> naturally accuracy in this region could be improved by retaining higher order terms in ( [ sin5 ] ) , but this would become a more numeric than analytic approach . the upper inset shows the dependence of the accuracy of the prediction on the number of points ( at a separation of 1ns ) sampled from the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy increases initially as more points improve the fitted value of @xmath0 , however after a certain length the accuracy is diminished by long term envelope effects in the dynamics not captured by the single term approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the corresponding analysis in the frequency domain would not be equally affected by the long time envelope , however a large number of points in the fft is then required in order to obtain the desired accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the lower inset of figure [ fig:3 ] shows the direct dependence of @xmath0 on the temperature . the temperature range with steepest gradient and hence greatest frequency dependence on temperature varies with the coupling strength ; </S>",
    "<S> thus the device could be specifically designed to have a maximal sensitivity in the temperature range of the most interest .    in summary , we have developed and explored a new approach to the qubit - oscillator model , finding succinct expressions for the qubit dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous theoretical approaches , our expressions are valid in the stronger coupling regime that is rapidly gaining experimental relevance . </S>",
    "<S> we have further proposed an application of our model enabling precise temperature measurements of the oscillator mode . </S>",
    "<S> this could be used either as part of the calibration of an oscillator experiment or as a tuned , standalone device .    </S>",
