    "there are many routes to investigating the mechanism of high - temperature superconductivity and naively one might expect the normal state to be the simplest . despite concerted experimental effort however , @xcite the normal state properties of cuprates remain a profound theoretical challenge .",
    "@xcite indeed , even from the earliest transport measurements in these compounds it was clear that the normal state was far from conventional .",
    "@xcite arguably the most remarkable phenomena are the distinct power laws of the in - plane resistivity @xmath4 and inverse hall angle @xmath5 temperature dependences .",
    "in optimally doped yba@xmath0cu@xmath6o@xmath7 ( ybco ) and la@xmath8sr@xmath9cuo@xmath10 ( lsco ) for example , @xmath11 varies linearly with temperature over a wide temperature range , whereas @xmath5 maintains a strong @xmath12 dependence .",
    "@xcite in other words , it is as if these materials exhibit distinct scattering mechanisms which are separately manifested according to the experimental probe being considered .",
    "anderson coined the phrase lifetime separation to describe this anomalous behavior and today its interpretation remains one of the greatest obstacles to the development of a coherent description of the normal state quasiparticle dynamics in high-@xmath13 cuprates .",
    "three contrasting approaches dominate the current thinking on the transport problem in cuprates ; anderson s two - lifetime picture,@xcite marginal fermi - liquid ( mfl ) phenomenology @xcite and models based on fermionic quasiparticles that invoke specific ( anisotropic ) scattering mechanisms within the basal plane.@xcite in the two - lifetime approach , scattering processes involving momentum transfer perpendicular and parallel to the fermi surface are governed by independent transport and hall scattering rates 1/@xmath14 and 1/@xmath15 with different @xmath16-dependencies .",
    "the proponents of the mfl hypothesis assume a single @xmath16-linear scattering rate which naturally accounts for @xmath11 , but introduce an unconventional expansion in the magnetotransport response whereby the hall angle , for example , is given by the square of the transport lifetime .",
    "@xcite this anomalous expansion is attributed to anisotropy in the ( elastic ) impurity scattering rate , possibly due to small - angle scattering off impurities located away from the cuo@xmath0 plane .",
    "@xcite    attempts to explain the anomalous behavior of @xmath11 and @xmath17 in cuprates within a fermi - liquid ( fl ) approach have centered around the assumption of a ( single ) _",
    "inelastic _ scattering rate that is strongly dependent on the quasiparticle wave - number @xmath18 .",
    "this anisotropy can arise either due to anisotropic electron - electron ( possibly umklapp ) scattering @xcite or coupling to a singular bosonic mode , be that of spin , @xcite charge @xcite or @xmath19-wave superconducting fluctuations .",
    "@xcite generating a clear separation of lifetimes within these single - lifetime scenarios however requires a subtle balancing act between different regions in * k*-space with distinct @xmath16-dependencies .",
    "@xcite    in order to test these various proposals and to proceed towards a theoretical consensus , information on the momentum ( * k * ) and energy ( @xmath20 or @xmath16 ) dependence of the transport lifetime @xmath3 at or near the fermi level @xmath21 is urgently required .",
    "this is a non - trivial exercise however since the transport coefficients themselves are angle - averaged quantities involving differently weighted integrations around the fermi surface ( fs ) . whilst angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) can probe directly the in - plane quasi - particle lifetime via the imaginary part of the self - energy im@xmath22(*k*,@xmath20 ) , its relevance to dc transport is still unclear .",
    "@xcite moreover , there remains some dispute as to the correct form of im@xmath22(*k*,@xmath20 ) even for samples with nominally the same composition.@xcite    measurements of interlayer magnetoresistance as a function of angle have yielded important information about the fs topology ( size and shape ) in a variety of layered metals including organic conductors@xcite and quasi - two - dimensional ( q2d ) oxides .",
    "@xcite in a recent paper , we showed that this technique could be developed to extract information on the scattering rate anisotropy and applied the technique to overdoped tl@xmath0ba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 ( ) .",
    "@xcite in the present paper , we present a more thorough and detailed analysis of our angle - dependent magnetoresistance ( admr ) measurements on overdoped , focusing in particular on the procedure used to fit admr and show how this analysis fails at higher temperatures unless one includes such anisotropy in @xmath3 .",
    "we progressively introduce anisotropy into the formalism , and explore the effects of this both in the cyclotron frequency @xmath2 and the transport lifetime @xmath3 .",
    "the approach presented here is similar to that described recently by kennett and mckenzie who derived a generalized expression for admr in layered metals with basal - plane anisotropy .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we focus on issues pertinent to , the importance of each parameter in fitting the admr signal and their interdependence , and the issue of sample misalignment .",
    "although it is difficult to isolate anisotropy in one from anisotropy in the other , the strong temperature evolution of the admr signal ( and subsequent measurements of its doping dependence @xcite ) suggests that the dominant anisotropy is in @xmath3 and not @xmath2 .",

    "however we are now over - parameterized since @xmath35 and @xmath142 can compensate each other to within a factor of @xmath195 . as a consequence",
    ", one can not accurately quote absolute values for each parameter individually , but rather the _ sum",
    "_ @xmath196 ( see inset ( b ) of figure [ betaksix ] ) .",
    "we can parameterize the quality of the fits by the sum of squared differences of the data from the fitted curve , which is denoted @xmath197 . as @xmath198 becomes large ,",
    "the terms @xmath35 and @xmath103 are no longer able to compensate and the fits decline in quality . however , as shown in figure [ betaksix ] , there is also a broad flat region over which @xmath197 is minimized and one can not pinpoint the exact value of @xmath142 . the axes in inset ( a ) are shifted so that it is apparent that the sum @xmath161 is pinned to a value of about @xmath199 , a fact which continues to be true at higher temperatures no matter what one forces @xmath142 to be .",
    "similarly , the value of @xmath196 is pinned to nearly zero at low temperature . from the low-@xmath16 parameterization used previously to set the fs parameters , we can settle on a value of @xmath200 which is comparable to that estimated from the arpes - derived dispersion despite being opposite in sign .",
    "panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of figure [ taucomp ] show the resulting fits to the new parameterization scheme , in which only @xmath35 and @xmath107 are allowed to vary with temperature , for @xmath201k , @xmath202k and @xmath203k respectively .",
    "in contrast to previous schemes , the quality of the fits are comparable at all temperatures , without the need for any variation in the other parameters .",
    "hence , by introducing @xmath16-dependent anisotropy in the scattering rate , there is no longer any need to invoke fs reconstruction to account for the evolution of the admr data .",
    "we therefore conclude that this is the most elegant and physically realistic parameterization scheme of all those considered here .",
    "the sign of @xmath35 is found to be positive , indicating that scattering is weakest along the zone diagonals , as determined previously by azimuthal admr measurements .",
    "@xcite as the temperature is raised , @xmath35 increases markedly .",
    "this implies that the anisotropy resides in the _ inelastic _ , rather than the elastic scattering channel .",
    "as with anisotropy in @xmath2 , anisotropy in the scattering rate can be fs - derived , e.g. due to fs instabilities such as charge - density waves , spin - density waves or antiferromagnetic fluctuations . spin ,",
    "charge , or indeed superconducting fluctuations all have specific momentum ( and frequency ) dependence that is peaked at ( or in some cases , confined to ) particular regions in * k*-space .",
    "anisotropy in @xmath204 can also signify additional physics due , for example , to strong electron correlations near a mott insulating state or anisotropic electron - impurity scattering .",
    "@xcite the present analysis can not of course reveal the microscopic mechanism of the anisotropic scattering itself , but can identify some important characteristics of the scattering mechanism , such as its magnitude or its symmetry .",
    "systematic measurements , e.g. as a function of doping and or pressure , would then allow a detailed comparison with the various theoretical proposals and thus help to reveal important hints as to its microscopic origin .",
    "in this paper we have set out a detailed formalism for incorporating in - plane anisotropy , both in the cyclotron frequency and in the transport lifetime , into the analysis of interlayer magnetoresistance of a q2d metal .",
    "the focus of the present paper has been to illustrate the need to introduce an anisotropic scattering rate in order to explain the evolution of the admr data in overdoped superconducting  within a boltzmann framework .",
    "an anisotropic cyclotron frequency @xmath205 can fit the data , but only if we allow the parameters describing the fermi surface itself to change as a function of temperature .",
    "given the absence of evidence for such reconstruction , this hypothesis seems unlikely .",
    "if , on the other hand , an anisotropic scattering time is introduced , all the fs parameters can remain constant and _ only _ @xmath107 and the anisotropy in @xmath188 are adjusted .",
    "such a simple parameterization is both elegant and experimentally accurate and we therefore believe it to be the most likely explanation of the observed admr data .",
    "a cautionary note is perhaps appropriate here . in the preceding calculations",
    "we have assumed the relaxation - time approximation and so the microscopic relaxation dynamics have been ignored .",
    "the concept of anisotropic scattering remains valid as long as @xmath206 is interpreted as the exponential decay of the distribution between scattering events @xcite .",
    "however , we can not rule out more exotic relaxation dynamics that depend on the presence of the magnetic field and hence may be manifested differently if probed by a different means ( for example , photoemission ) .",
    "we have discovered that such exotic dynamics do not need to be invoked to explain our admr data and conclude that its evolution with temperature , when viewed from a boltzmann framework using the relaxation - time approximation , is best explained by a scattering rate with a temperature dependent anisotropy .    at high doping levels ,",
    "lifetime separation in cuprates is less apparent , @xcite leading some researchers to consider the problem from this perspective .",
    "this route has the added advantage of allowing the limits of the conventional boltzmann transport theory to be explored as one moves across the phase diagram towards to more exotic and potentially non - fl ground state on the underdoped side .",
    "the key message here is that by generalizing the theory to include an anisotropic scattering rate @xmath207 one can continue to apply the boltzmann approach and successfully account not only for the evolution of the admr with temperature , but also the distinct @xmath16-dependencies of @xmath4 and cot@xmath208 found in overdoped .",
    "@xcite furthermore , initial measurements of the doping dependence of @xmath35 in tl2201 suggest a significant increase in anisotropy in @xmath209 as one move towards optimal doping , @xcite consistent with the observed increase in lifetime separation ( as manifest in the temperature dependence of the hall coefficient ) with decreasing doping . @xcite the introduction of such anisotropy has proven a fruitful model to understand the normal state of high - temperature superconductors , @xcite though clearly more work is needed to parameterize @xmath204(*k * ) fully and to identify the origin of the anisotropy .    finally",
    ", although the focus of this paper has been a system with body - centered - tetragonal symmetry , the analysis could very easily be generalized to layered systems of other crystallographic symmetries as already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite and perhaps also one - dimensional systems with anisotropic scattering.@xcite admr experiments on bedt - ttf based organic superconductors have already been performed at low temperature and explained in a boltzmann framework without the need to invoke an anisotropic scattering rate .",
    "@xcite a full azimuthal and temperature dependence on other salts may however require the introduction of such a parameterization .",
    "similarly the same ideas may also apply to layered charge - density - wave compounds such as the rare - earth tritellurides @xmath210.@xcite the boltzmann equation , though simple in its assumptions , thus remains a powerful paradigm whose explanatory power is still to be explored .",
    "admr is an ideal probe for just such an exploration .",

    "j.a . would like to thank the lloyd s tercentenary foundation .",
    "in this section we illustrate how sample misalignment can be accounted for .",
    "the effect of sample misalignment on admr has been considered by several authors before this study , in particular goddard @xcite and abdel - jawad .@xcite before we begin , let us define two frames of reference , that of the laboratory @xmath211 , in which the field is parallel to the @xmath212 direction , and that of the crystal @xmath213 .",
    "the @xmath214 axis is taken as the axis of polar rotation and @xmath215 is perpendicular to this .",
    "the normal to the crystallographic plane shall be defined as @xmath216 , and the in - plane directions @xmath217 and @xmath218 shall be taken to be parallel and perpendicular to the copper - oxide bonds respectively .",
    "the angle between the field direction and the crystallographic normal @xmath216 gives the crystallographic polar angle @xmath219 .",
    "the projection of the field onto the @xmath220 plane gives the crystallographic azimuthal angle @xmath39 , taken from the @xmath217 axis .",
    "there are two important differences between this study and that of goddard _",
    "et al._. @xcite firstly , instead of correcting experimental @xmath67 and @xmath65 for misalignment to find the appropriate crystallographic @xmath219 and @xmath39 , we fit the experimental data by including the misalignment in the fitting procedure . secondly , in the analysis of goddard,@xcite the crystallographic axes @xmath217 and @xmath218 can fall anywhere in the plane of the crystal and do not have assigned direction with respect to the crystal bonds .",
    "this gives the misalignment one less parameter , and one of the crystal axes can always fall somewhere in the @xmath221 plane of the laboratory frame . in the present analysis",
    "this is not the case and so three rotations need to be included in the fitting procedure in order to account for every possible misalignment :    * beginning with the sample aligned with the laboratory frame , there is a misalignment in azimuthal angle denoted by @xmath222 , rotated about @xmath212 as shown in figure [ psias ] ( a ) .",
    "* a rotation about the @xmath214 axis denoted by @xmath223 as shown in figure [ psias ] ( b ) . * a rotation about the @xmath215 axis denoted by @xmath224 as shown in figure [ psias ] ( c ) .     and azimuthal @xmath71 angles that enter eq . [ condi ] depend only on the projection of @xmath225 on the crystal axes .",
    "this projection will change as a function of @xmath67 and @xmath65 and so must be calculated at each point.,width=170 ]    these transformations are elegantly described algebraically .",
    "we follow the notation whereby a rotation @xmath226 is a rotation of a vector @xmath227 by angle @xmath219 about an axis @xmath228 . in particular",
    "the laboratory axis @xmath229 is tranformed relative to the crystallographic @xmath230 ( before any azimuthal or polar rotation ) axis to      due to the misalignment of the sample . in an admr experiment , the sample",
    "is then rotated about the laboratory @xmath229 azimuthally by an angle @xmath65 , and then rotated about the @xmath232 axis a polar angle @xmath67 .",
    "the position of the crystallographic @xmath233 after these azimuthal and polar rotations axis is given by      with reference to figure [ thetacrys ] it is elementary to see that the projection of the field parallel to @xmath229 on the crystallographic @xmath233 will give @xmath114 , which should be used to calculate the value of the magnetoresistance in the analysis . similarly , the projection on the @xmath235 plane will yield @xmath71 .",
    "algebraically we have ,          the asymmetries for the sample considered in the present paper were estimated to be @xmath238 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 .",
    "the parameter @xmath222 was approximately equal to values estimated from diffractometry performed after the admr experiment .",
