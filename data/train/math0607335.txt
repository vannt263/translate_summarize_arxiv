    "a fundamental example of a subfactor is the fixed - point algebra of an outer action of a finite group on a von neumann algebra with trivial center . in this case",
    "the structure of the subfactor is determined by the structure of the group .",
    "one then thinks of a general subfactor as a `` quantum '' version of a finite group , and subfactor theory as a `` non - commutative galois theory '' . in this spirit",
    "it is natural to consider an intermediate subfactor @xmath9 as an analogue of a subgroup , and indeed , the intermediate subfactors of the fixed - point subfactor of an action of a finite group are precisely the fixed - point subfactors of its subgroups .",
    "the main classification theory for subfactors involves a _ standard invariant _ ,",
    "which was axiomatized by popa @xcite and then described by jones using a diagrammatic apparatus called _ planar algebras _",
    "a major structural feature of subfactors is duality : there are two algebraic structures applicable to the standard invariant ( analagous to hopf - algebra duality for groups ) which are reflected in the planar algebra picture by a choice of shading .",
    "bisch discovered the remarkable fact that intermediate subfactors are characterized by `` biprojections''- elements of the standard invariant that are projections in both algebra structures @xcite .",
    "bisch s theorem thus reduces the problem of intermediate subfactors to a problem of planar algebras .",
    "bisch and jones then studied the planar algebra generated by a single biprojection , which yields a generic construction of an intermediate subfactor , or more generally , a chain of intermediate subfactors @xcite .",
    "this led naturally to the approach of trying to construct more general families of intermediate subfactors by considering planar algebras generated by multiple biprojections .",
    "there is a notion of commutativity for pairs of intermediate subfactors ( defined simply by commutativity of the corresponding projections in @xmath10 . )",
    "sano and watatani considered the _ set of angles _ between two subfactors , a numerical invariant which measures the degree of noncommutativity of a pair of intermediate subfactors @xcite .",
    "it turns out that pairs of commuting subfactors can be constructed simply via a tensor product , but the construction of intermediate subfactors with nontrivial angles has proven much more difficult .    in @xcite , jones and",
    "the present author set out to construct generic pairs of noncommuting intermediate subfactors by assuming _ no extra structure _ , i.e. that the standard invariants of the elementary subfactors involved were just temperley - lieb algebras , a situation also referred to as _ supertransitivity_.",
    "it was hoped that since the bimodule components of the intermediate subfactors obey the temperley - lieb fusion rules , that information together with invariants such as angles and indices would provide sufficient rigidity to suggest appropriate planar relations among biprojections and yield generic constructions of planar algebras generated by two biprojections .",
    "instead we found the surprising result that there are essentially only two quadrilaterals with no extra structure .",
    "one is the fixed point algebra of an outer action of @xmath11 on a factor ( where the intermediate subfactors are fixed point algebras of distinct order @xmath12 subgroups ) and the other is a new example with irrational angles and indices coming from the ghj family of subfactors .",
    "the dearth of examples with no extra structure does not however mean that the original project of constructing planar algebras generated by multiple biprojections is unsound .",
    "rather , because of the rigidity of intermediate subfactors , we must adjust our hypotheses if we wish to obtain more examples .    in the present work we continue this approach by considering a ( noncommuting , irreducible , finite index ) quadrilateral in which only the lower two elementary subfactors @xmath13 and @xmath14 are assumed to be supertransitive .",
    "we also assume that the lower indices @xmath7 $ ] and @xmath15 $ ] are less than @xmath5 ( and therefore equal to @xmath16 for some @xmath17 by jones celebrated theorem in @xcite ) .",
    "we first show that for any quadrilateral with lower indices @xmath7 $ ] and @xmath15 $ ] less than @xmath5 there is a unique nontrivial angle value , equal to @xmath8 - 1 } $ ] .",
    "we then describe a series of examples in the ghj family - first discovered in @xcite- of quadrilaterals whose lower subfactors are supertransitive with indices @xmath7=[q : n]=4cos^2\\frac{\\pi}{2k } , k\\geq 3 $ ] .",
    "ultimately we prove the following result :    the series of ghj subfactors for @xmath18 at the trivalent vertex gives a complete list of noncommuting irreducible hyperfinite quadrilaterals such that @xmath13 and @xmath19 are hyperfinite supertransitive subfactors with index less than @xmath5 .",
    "in particular it turns out there is a unique such quadrilateral for each even value @xmath7=4cos^2\\frac{\\pi}{2k } $ ] but none for the odd values @xmath7=4cos^2\\frac{\\pi}{2k-1 } $ ] .",
    "the methods of proof involve both the planar apparatus for intermediate subfactors developed in @xcite and a notion of _ forked temperley - lieb algebras _ , in which a sequence of temperley - lieb projections @xmath20 in a von neumann algebra can be initially extended by either of two orthogonal projections @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this is a special case of @xmath23 algebras associated to @xmath24-shaped graphs , which were studied by evans and gould in @xcite .",
    "it turns out this situation precisely captures the structure of noncommuting supertransitive intermediate subfactors with small index",

    "this procedure is called the _",

    "some properties of the index are : @xmath32 \\geq 1 $ ] , @xmath35=[m : n ] $ ] , and if @xmath36 , then @xmath32=[m : p][p : n ] $ ] .",
    "it turns out that not all numbers greater than @xmath37 can occur as index values , by the following remarkable theorem of jones .    *",

    "the tower of relative commutants can also be thought of as algebras of bimodule intertwiners of tensor powers of the @xmath50 bimodule @xmath10 .    as @xmath50 bimodules , @xmath51 , ( @xmath52 factors ) .",

    "the lattice of finite - dimensional von neumann algebras +   + @xmath57 +   + is called the _ standard invariant _ and was axiomatized by popa @xcite .",
    "popa showed that the standard invariant is a complete invariant under certain conditions called _ strong amenability _ , and also introduced a construction of subfactors having a given standard invariant .",
    "note that the standard invariant always contains the jones projections @xmath20 , but in general will contain more structure as well .",
    "the jones projections satisfy the following relations : ( i ) @xmath58 ; and ( ii ) @xmath59 if @xmath60 , where @xmath61^{-1 } $ ] .",
    "the algebras they generate are in a sense `` minimal '' standard invariants , and are known as the temperley - lieb algebras after their original appearance in @xcite .    in @xcite kauffman introduced a pictorial representation of the temperley - lieb algebras related to the skein theory of knot diagrams .",
    "it was soon noticed by jones and others that many seemingly complicated linear relations in the standard invariants of subfactors had simple pictorial representations . to capture this remarkable phenomenon in a rigorous and systematic fashion",
    ", jones introduced the notion of a _",
    "planar algebra_.    a _ planar tangle _ consists of a disc in the plane , together with some disjoint internal discs and nonintersecting strings connecting certain boundary points of the discs , all defined up to planar isotopy .",
    "there is a natural notion of composition of tangles ( by isotoping one tangle to fit in an internal disc of another tangle and removing the boundary ) .",
    "one then thinks of the internal discs as `` inputs '' and the external boundary as the `` output '' , and the collection of planar tangles forms an operad .",
    "if @xmath1 is a subfactor , its planar algebra is essentially an action of the operad of planar tangles on the central vectors of the tensor powers of the @xmath50 bimodule @xmath26 , i.e. the standard invariant . in this picture , the trivial tangles - those with no internal discs- correspond to the temperley - lieb algebras , which are present for any subfactor , and more complicated tangles may reflect additional structure . in this way , the algebraic and combinatorial structure of a subfactor is captured in terms of the geometry of the plane .",
    "jones axioms for a planar algebra turned out to be exactly analogous to popa s axioms for a @xmath62-lattice in his description of the standard invariant , so by popa s theorem a subfactor can actually be constructed by describing its planar algebra , as in the work of bisch and jones ( @xcite ) .    for more precise details on definitions and examples of planar algebras and the meaning of various pictures we direct the reader to @xcite .",
