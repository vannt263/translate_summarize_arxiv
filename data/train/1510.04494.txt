    "<S> hence , @xmath37 is independent of the input direction of the photon : such a set - up can not rectify light propagation in the single - photon regime . </S>",
    "<S> notice that these calculations agree with the fully symmetric transmission coefficient obtained in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> fortunately , the diode does achieve rectification when the inputs are _ </S>",
    "<S> coherent states_. in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : densityplot ] , we plot the diode efficiency @xmath28 for coherent states of different mean photon flux @xmath23 as a function of the detuning @xmath38 and the phase parameter @xmath39 . as a first observation </S>",
    "<S> , our results agree qualitatively with the semi - classical calculation based on a fabry - perot interferometer @xcite where considerable directionality was obtained for a pumping power of @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the efficiency does not exceed @xmath41 ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : density2 ] ) , in contrast with the semi - classical prediction that exceeded @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we notice another feature that was not discussed previously : when the power is further decreased ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : density3 ] and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : density4 ] ) , the efficiency is found to drop drastically over most of the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> one can still find small regions of high efficiency , but it would require extreme fine - tuning to select those working points when @xmath42 .    in order to investigate how the efficiency varies with the power of the input coherent state , we study the diode response for fixed values of the detuning @xmath43 and the phase @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figpower]a . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , one notice that as the power increases beyond approximately @xmath45 , the diode efficiency starts to drop . this is easily understood as being a consequence of the fact that the atoms can absorb at most one photon . </S>",
    "<S> thus when a significant mean number of photon per atomic lifetime enters the device , both atoms are highly saturated and most of the light is transmitted regardless of which side it comes from . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the efficiency also goes to zero as the input power tends towards zero , in agreement with the single - photon result .    </S>",
    "<S> _ atom excitation as the origin of rectification. _    both the single - photon result and the absence of rectification for very low power indicate clearly that rectification is due to multi - photon components in the light field  . while this is clearly established , </S>",
    "<S> looking at the horizontal axis of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figpower]a , one may wonder what multi - photon effects one can expect for a coherent state of power as small as @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the qualitative behavior being admitted , one might have expected to find the effective rectification range at higher powers . </S>",
    "<S> we are going to provide evidence that rectification becomes effective when one atom is excited but not both . </S>",
    "<S> obviously this mechanism requires at least two photons in the field : one to excite one atom , the other(s ) to be transmitted or reflected .    </S>",
    "<S> let us then study the excitation probabilities of the atoms in the steady state . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we monitor the probability of finding the first ( second ) atom excited @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , or of finding both atoms excited simultaneously @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate these probabilities for the case where light is incident from the left ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figpower]b ) , as well as from the right ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figpower]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we first observe that @xmath49 is found to be independent of where the light comes from , and starts to increase significantly at input power around @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this coincides with the drop in rectification efficiency at the high power end , thus matching the explanation given above : the diode becomes transparent from both directions when both atoms are significantly excited .    on the other hand , while @xmath47 and @xmath48 are found to be approximately equal ( compare the two curves in each panel ) , they vary significantly depending on the direction of the incoming pulse ( compare the two panels ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the light is coming from the right , it encounters first the resonant atom which acts as an almost perfect mirror when @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen from the reflection coefficient of a coherent state on a single atom @xmath52 which is in agreement in the limit of low power with the single - photon result @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence we get @xmath53 and the off - resonant atom does not play any role . only when the power becomes non - negligible @xmath50 will the right atom start saturating . </S>",
    "<S> however at this level of power both atoms start to be significantly excited and no directionality is expected as explained previously .    </S>",
    "<S> when the light is coming from the left , the behavior is richer . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath47 and @xmath48 start increasing at a very low power of @xmath54 , reaching a plateau until a power of @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this can understood as follow : thanks to the non - zero detuning of the first atom , the light is able to enter the cavity and is stored inside for some time . </S>",
    "<S> the resonant atom then saturates at a lower power than when light is incident from the right . </S>",
    "<S> we identify this as the key mechanism leading to rectification of light in the range of power corresponding to this plateau . at lower power </S>",
    "<S> , the light is not stored for long enough time , so the device effectively sees one photon at a time , and the single photon result with no directionality is recovered .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions. _ we presented a full quantum mechanical analysis of a proposed optical diode consisting of two different atoms coupled to a 1d waveguide using heisenberg equations . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the diode fails to work in the single - photon regime but performs rectification for input coherent states in an optimal range of power . </S>",
    "<S> the working mechanism of the diode is revealed by studying the excitation probabilities of the two atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this detailed understanding may inspire improved designs of passive state - independent optical diodes .    </S>",
