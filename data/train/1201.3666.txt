    "in the supergravity limit of ads / cft , a large @xmath0 , strong coupling gauge theory is dual to a theory of gravity which is local in the sense that it is described by a local lagrange density .",
    "the latter implies the canonical notion of locality that observables with spacelike separated support commute , so that no measurement can influence another measurement outside its future lightcone .",
    "understanding bulk locality from the perspective of the lower dimensional boundary gauge theory is a challenge @xcite .",
    "a canonical approach is the @xmath1 perturbative construction of bulk field operators from smeared single trace boundary operators @xcite .",
    "the only case that has been worked out so far is the scalar field , for which one can find smearing functions @xmath2 such that the following operator identity holds @xmath3 in this paper we work out the cases of the gauge field and gravitation field .",
    "technically , the construction is now complicated by the need to fix a gauge and solve the constraints before the field operators can be expressed in terms of gauge invariant boundary currents .",
    "conceptually , one may wonder if the constructed field operators have physical meaning and if in the gravitational theory one can talk about locality in the sense of local commuting observables , given the mantra that there are no local diffeomorphism invariant observables .",
    "we begin by reviewing that non - local gauge invariant operators can be traded for local operators in a fixed gauge , but that these operators can have local commutators only up to the non - locality required by the constraint .",
    "we then explicitly carry out the canonical quantization of the maxwell field in ads , in an appropriate generalization of coulomb gauge .",
    "we work out the non - local commutators due to gauss law in detail and from mode expansions we obtain leading order smearing functions in coulomb and radial gauge . for the gravitational field",
    "we work out the gauss law commutators in transverse gauge , which in this case implies a perturbative notion of holography .",
    "finally we obtain the leading order smearing function in pfefferman - graham gauge . in the discussion we comment on future directions .",
    "a charged scalar field field @xmath4 is not gauge invariant .",
    "however , if there is a place where the potential is fixed we can contruct a gauge invariant operator by connecting the field to this place with a wilson line . for example , consider a half space that has a flat boundary on which the gauge field @xmath5 vanishes .",
    "let @xmath6 be the coordinates on the boundary and @xmath7 a `` radial coordinate '' away from the boundary ( see fig .",
    "[ wilsonlines ] ) .",
    "then one gauge invariant non - local operator is @xmath8 another gauge invariant operator that we could construct is the wilson loop in figure [ wilsonlines ] @xmath9 which measures the potential difference between us and the boundary .",
    "it is clear that @xmath10\\neq 0,\\ ] ] even though @xmath11 and @xmath12 are spacelike to each other because these non - local operators will overlap .",
    "connects a charged scalar to the boundary .",
    "the gauge invariant integral of @xmath13 along @xmath14 reduces to the scalar potential @xmath15 in radial gauge . ]",
    "however , these operators are precisely @xmath16 and @xmath17 if we choose radial gauge @xmath18 . from the gauge fixed perspective",
    "the non - locality in the commutator comes from having to impose the gauss law constraint . as an illustration ,",
    "consider flat space quantum electrodynamics in coulomb gauge .",
    "the gauge field is fixed to go to zero at spacelike infinity and we can then define non - local gauge invariant operators @xcite that have `` wilson lines '' connecting the charged field to infinity or equivalently work in the gauge fixed theory @xcite . gauge fixing @xmath19 yields the constraint @xmath20 which after canonical quantization of @xmath21 leads to the non - local equal time commutator @xmath22 = -\\frac{e}{4\\pi |{\\boldsymbol{x}}-{\\boldsymbol{x}}'| } \\psi(x',t),\\ ] ] and consequently a non - local commutator between the electric field and the electron .    for gravity ,",
    "the situation is similar .",
    "it is clear that it is useful to talk about localized events even in gravitational theories , but that position should be defined in a coordinate independent , relative way . if space had a boundary , that boundary would be a convenient reference point .",
    "so we consider again half space with a flat boundary , where now the metric is held fixed ( we have in mind asymptotically poincare ads with a cut - off ) .",
    "then we can define a scalar field @xmath16 in that space with @xmath23 where @xmath7 measures the log of the geodesic distance along a geodesic that starts at @xmath24 normal to the boundary .",
    "this diffeomorphism invariant field operator is a non - local functional of @xmath25 .",
    "however , this is exactly the same thing as imposing the gauge fixing condition that the metric take the form @xmath26 analogous to gaussian normal coordinates @xcite and then considering the diffeomorphism variant field @xmath16 in these coordinates .",
    "one can also define gauge invariant operators that reduce to particular metric components in some gauge , namely the length of curves with two ends at the boundary . just like before those will have non - local commutators due to the constraint , which we will work out in section [ gravitysection ] .",
    "an important difference between gravity and gauge theory is that wilson loops in the bulk , which in the gauge theory are observables of compact support that commute with the electric field at infinity , have no gravitional analogue .",
    "to summarize : for all intents and purposes we can talk about local fields after gauge fixing as physical observables , but these will have commutators that are local only to the extent allowed by the constraint .",
    "we will see this explicitly for the @xmath27 gauge field and gravity in ads .",
    "the maxwell field coupled to a charged scalar in ads@xmath28 has action @xmath29,\\ ] ] and the equations of motion for the gauge field are @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the ads gauge covariant derivative @xmath32 and @xmath33 the covariant derivative with respect to the metric on the poincar patch , given by with @xmath34 . for later use",
    "we define the electric field , whose flux is conserved by gauss law ( see for index conventions ) @xmath35    the goal is to fix a gauge , solve the constraint , and canonically quantize the fields .",
    "we can then calculate the commutator analogous to and obtain the leading order smearing function .",
    "radial gauge @xmath18 and lorentz gauge @xmath36 are usually convenient gauges because they respectively preserve the full ads and poincar symmetry of the metric , and we will obtain the smearing function in radial gauge at the end of this section",
    ". however , these gauge conditions make it harder to see that gauss law leads to non - local commutators .",
    "we therefore generalize the coulomb gauge condition , which in flat space is @xmath37 and eliminates the term involving the spatial components from the constraint .",
    "the generalization of this condition to ads is not @xmath38 .",
    "instead we see from that we can eliminate the spatial components from the constraint by imposing @xmath39 this reduces the constraint to @xmath40 and the remaining equations to @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is a generalized transverse projector @xmath44 the spatial equations can be decoupled using the gauge condition , yielding @xmath45 where @xmath46 . the gauge condition and resulting equations of motion are not @xmath47 covariant , nor are they covariant under the euclidean @xmath48 symmetries of a constant timeslice .",
    "green s functions for these equations will therefore not be functions of a single invariant distance . with boundary conditions that we will discuss in the",
    "shortly , the constraint determines @xmath15 uniquely in terms of the charge density .",
    "we can now canonically quantize the remaining physical degrees of freedom subject to the gauge fixing condition , @xmath49 & = i\\delta^{tr}_{ab}(u - u ' ) , & \\pi_a = & z^{3-d}\\partial_0 a_a , \\\\",

    "the maxwell equations are pure constraint and the solutions are simple",
    ". we will therefore solve it first .      in ads@xmath56 , the coulomb gauge condition is @xmath57 .",
    "we can consistently impose the slightly stronger condition @xmath18 ( radial gauge ) , after which the equations take the form @xmath58 with the homogeneous solution @xmath59 the boundary conditions in @xmath54 are less intuitive than in higher dimensions . spatial infinity consists of two disconnected points so flux can come in from @xmath60 .",
    "we demand that there is not so @xmath61 . on the other side , at @xmath62 , we fix @xmath63 so that the unique homogeneous solution @xmath64 . solving the gauss law constraint for a point charge a point charge @xmath65 with these boundary conditions",
    "then yields the coulomb potential @xmath66 the solution for an arbitrary localized charge distribution is @xmath67 the second equation is implied by current conservation . from , we then find the non - local commutator @xmath68 = q z^2\\theta(z - z')\\hat\\phi(z'),\\ ] ] between the electric field and the charged scalar .",
    "as explained in the previous section one way to understand this is that @xmath69 is a secretly non - local gauge invariant operator that creates both the charged scalar and its ( longitudinal ) electric field .",
    "alternatively we simply notice that is required by charge conservation .",
    "gauss law relates the integral of electric flux through the boundary to the total charge in the bulk so that in @xmath54 the electric field is proportional to the total charge operator @xmath70 the extrapolate dictionary now just says @xmath71 , as we might have expected .      the general case of ads@xmath28 , while conceptually the same , is technically useful as a warmup for gravity .",
    "fourier transforming along the spatial boundary directions , the homogeneous solution to the constraint is @xmath73 where the two modes @xmath74 are normalized such that for small @xmath7 we have @xmath75 and @xmath76 . to obtain the green s function",
    "we solve @xmath77 with the boundary condition that @xmath78 at @xmath62 and @xmath60 .",

    "this can be understood as a consequence of charge conservation and can be integrated over a spatial slice through the boundary to yield the commutator of the total charge with the field . with the bulk dimension",
    "greater than two there are photons and from the mode expansion we can get an expression for the field operator in terms of the boundary current , analogous to . for timelike boundary momenta @xmath82 the mode solutions to are @xmath83 where we have defined @xmath84 and similarly @xmath85 and @xmath86 with the substitution @xmath87 .",
    "the normalization is such that near the bounary we have @xmath88 for the solutions @xmath89 normalization does not matter as we now impose the standard boundary condition @xmath90 . from the dictionary for timelike boundary momentum we then find @xmath91 substituting the solution into the gauge condition we get @xmath92 : the spatial components along the boundary are transverse with respect to the spatial momentum along the boundary",
    ". therefore we identify @xmath93 with the longitudinal part of the boundary current and @xmath94 with the transverse part @xmath95 when we plug this into the mode expansion , we obtain after inverse fourier transforming @xmath96 and swapping the integrals @xmath97 where the leading order smearing functions are @xmath98 the restriction of the integration range to timelike momenta is because from lorentz invariance @xmath99 for spacelike momenta .",
    "we can also easily obtain the smearing function in radial gauge @xmath18 , where the maxwell equations take the form @xmath100 if we impose the supplementary gauge condition that @xmath101 on the boundary , and solve the sourceless equations of motion , we find the general solution @xmath102 setting @xmath103 we find from the dictionary that @xmath104 so that @xmath105 with the simple smearing function @xmath106    we could have obtained the same smearing functions by solving for the green s functions for the spatial equations and applying green s theorem . for finding the results in this section",
    "that method is less direct but in general it makes it possible to find nicer smearing functions .",
    "although there is significantly more gauge redundancy in the case of gravity , perturbatively the structure is similar to electromagnetism .",
    "we will consider gravity coupled to a free massless scalar @xmath107 with @xmath108 and work to linearized order in metric perturbations around the ads background @xmath109 since gravity is trivial in @xmath54 we will immediately work in arbitrary dimension @xmath55 .",
    "the expansion of the einstein - hilbert action with cosmological constant to second order in @xmath110 is given in @xcite , and from it we obtain the linearized einstein equations on ads , which can be written as @xmath111 here @xmath112 , known as the trace reversed metric in four dimensions .",
    "the stress tensor for the scalar field is given by @xmath113 and using the canonical commutators we find @xmath114 = -iz^{d-1 } \\delta^d(u - u ' ) \\partial'_m \\phi(u').\\ ] ]      to solve the gravitational gauss law and see that it leads to a non - local commutator it is again easiest to work in transverse gauge . while this simplifies gauss law , which in this context we will refer to as the hamiltonian constraint , the other equations are hard to solve and the ads / cft dictionary is messy .",
    "therefore , we will not work out the full canonical quantization and smearing functions in this gauge but only discuss the gravitational gauss law . to generalize the flat space transverse gauge",
    "we first decompose the metric as follows @xmath115 with @xmath116 the unit timelike normal in the background .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint ( the 00 component of ) now takes the form @xmath117 and after imposing the transverse gauge condition @xmath118 it can be written as a poisson type equation @xmath119 which is solved by @xmath120 where @xmath121 with the two modes @xmath122 normalized such that near the boundary we have @xmath123 and @xmath124 . just as in the electromagnetic case we find a non - local commutator @xmath125 = -i \\phi_g(u , u ' ) \\partial_0 \\phi(u').\\ ] ] to first order in the perturbation we have a timelike killing field @xmath126 so that to this order we have a conserved energy @xmath127 applying this to we obtain @xmath128 while applying it to we find , as we should @xmath129=-i\\partial_0\\phi$ ] .",
    "all this is exactly analogous to the gauge field .",
    "however , for gravity it has profound consequences because the conserved charge is the time evolution operator . as explained in @xcite and made explicit by the smearing function construction of bulk operators , the boundary values of the fluctuating modes of the bulk fields are a complete set of observables .",
    "if we know the boundary values at all times we can reconstruct all the bulk operators . from we see that the bulk hamiltonian is a pure boundary term : it only depends on the boundary value of @xmath130 .",
    "what this means is that in fact the boundary values at a single time are a complete set , because from the commutators with the boundary value of @xmath130 with the other boundary values at fixed time we can obtain the boundary values at all times .",
    "this gives us a perturbative explanation of holography in the sense that while the number of degrees of freedom is not restricted , we see that at fixed time all bulk information is contained in the boundary .",
    "for the source free case can be written as @xmath131 as for the gauge field , finding a smearing function is much easier in radial ( pfefferman - graham ) gauge @xmath132 . from @xcite",
    "we find that , analogous to the electromagnetic case , we can impose supplementary gauge conditions @xmath133 and @xmath134 on the boundary after which the equations imply that these conditions hold everywhere .",
    "now reduces to @xmath135 which is solved by @xmath136 where @xmath137 is normalized on the boundary and @xmath138 is defined similarly with @xmath139 replaced by @xmath140 . in standard quantization",
    "we impose the boundary condition @xmath141 and the dictionary takes the form @xcite @xmath142 we therefore find @xmath143 with the smearing function @xmath144",
    "it would be nice to find covariant smearing functions of spacelike support using a green s function method , analogous to what was done in the scalar case in @xcite .",
    "however there is no way to completely fix the gauge in a covariant way .",
    "perhaps this is not a problem if instead one tried to find smearing functions for gauge invariant operators in the bulk such as the field strength , instead of the gauge field .",
    "it would also be very interesting to understand the non - perturbative breakdown of the construction .",
