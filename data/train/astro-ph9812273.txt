    "detailed studies of gravitational lenses have provided a wealth of information on galaxies , both through modeling of individual lens systems ( e.g. , schneider , ehlers , & falco 1992 ; blandford & narayan 1992 ) and from the statistical properties of multiply imaged sources ( e.g. , turner , ostriker , & gott 1984 ; kochanek 1996 ) . the extraordinary resolution of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has allowed for the first time the detection of lenses where both the source and the deflector are `` normal '' optically - selected galaxies .",
    "ratnatunga et al .",
    "( 1995 ) discovered two four - image `` einstein cross '' gravitational lenses in the groth - westphal strip .",
    "their mass models required ellipticities substantially above those of the light distributions , suggesting ( as is commonly suspected in radio lenses ) that some external shear is important to the lensing .    the hubble deep field ( hdf , williams et al .",
    "1996 ) , the deepest set of exposures taken with the hst , has enabled an unprecedented study of galaxy morphological evolution ( e.g. , ellis 1998 ) and the global star formation history ( e.g. , madau , pozzeti , & dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "candidate gravitational lenses were reported by hogg et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who noted on the basis of radio surveys that several lenses are expected in the hdf ( cf .",
    "cooray , quashnock , & miller 1998 ) .",
    "however , after further observations not one strong case for multiple imaging has been identified ( zepf , moustakas , & davis 1997 ; cohen 1998 ) .    the southern hubble deep field ( hdf - s , williams et al .  1998 )",
    "is a second set of ultra - deep hst exposures , and several lenses are again expected .",
    "the best candidate lens , noted by the hdf - s team ( williams 1998 ) , consists of a blue arc about @xmath1 from an elliptical galaxy . in this _",
    "letter _ we report on a detailed study of this arc and argue that it is a bona fide multiply imaged source .",
    "the wfpc2 hdf - s is a @xmath6  arcmin@xmath7 field centered on @xmath8 ( j2000 ) , imaged with the wfpc2 instrument on the hst in the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 bandpasses for total exposure times of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath14  s respectively , reaching point - source sensitivities of roughly @xmath16  mag ( williams et al .",
    "1998 ) . for the `` version-1.0 '' reductions of the images , we adopt the vega - relative calibrations supplied by the hdf - s team whereby 1  dn corresponds to @xmath17  mag , @xmath18  mag , @xmath19  mag , or @xmath20  mag .",
    "the images clearly show a bright candidate lens system at pixel location @xmath21 . with the pixel scale of @xmath22",
    "this is also @xmath23 ( j2000 ) .",
    "this candidate lens system will be called `` '' hereafter .",
    "the morphology of is that of a @xmath24  mag elliptical galaxy ( hereafter `` the elliptical '' ) with a much bluer arc ( hereafter `` the arc '' ) located @xmath1 to the nw from the center of the elliptical , as shown in figure  [ fig : lens ] .",
    "there is also a faint point - like source ( hereafter `` the dot '' ) located @xmath25 to the ne from the center of the elliptical .",
    "the elliptical is smooth and symmetrical , so images created by rotating its images through @xmath26 ( centered on the pixel nearest the center of the elliptical ) and subtracting them from their unrotated originals show essentially no sign of the elliptical .",
    "photometry of the arc was performed in these `` rotated - subtracted '' images .",
    "the total @xmath11 flux ( given in table  [ tab : photometry ] ) was measured through a partial annulus of inner radius @xmath27 and outer radius @xmath28 , extending over position angles @xmath29 ( north through east ) through @xmath30 .",
    "colors were measured through a partial annulus of inner and outer radii @xmath31 and @xmath32 , over @xmath33 through @xmath34 .",
    "the flux and colors of the dot were measured through a @xmath35 radius circular aperture . because nearby pixels are correlated , signal - to - noise ratios for photometric measurements were found by re - binning the image into pixels @xmath36 times larger .",
    "the arc separates into four distinct components , labeled @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , going clockwise around the arc .",
    "all have very similar colors .",
    "components @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath40 appear to have point - like centers with fuzz , while component @xmath39 is more extended .",
    "gaussians with the same fwhm as the psf ( 4  pixels ) were fit to components @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath40 , and a gaussian of variable width was fit to component @xmath39 , all in the @xmath10 rotated - subtracted image . the best - fit positions and fluxes of these gaussians are given in table  [ tab : astrometry ] .    in order to make arc - free images of the elliptical",
    ", the region of each image in the partial annulus centered on the elliptical with inner and outer radii of @xmath27 and @xmath28 and position angles @xmath29 through @xmath30 was replaced with the corresponding region diametrically opposite ( i.e. , at a position angle rotated by @xmath26 ) .",
    "these `` arc - removed '' images show virtually no evidence of the arc .",
    "the total @xmath12 flux of the elliptical was measured out to its 2-@xmath41 ( per pixel ) isophote .",
    "the colors were measured through @xmath42 radius circular apertures , and are given in table  [ tab : photometry ] .",
    "a de  vaucouleurs profile is a very good fit to the azimuthally averaged radial profile of the elliptical in the `` arc - removed '' images .",
    "the effective radius is @xmath43 and the @xmath12-band surface brightness at the effective radius is @xmath44  mag in each arcsec@xmath7 .",
    "the isophote ellipticity orientation varies with radius .",
    "the outer isophotes ( radii @xmath45 ) of the elliptical have ellipticity @xmath46 and are elongated along @xmath47 . the inner isophotes ( radii @xmath48 ) also have ellipticity @xmath49 but are elongated along @xmath50 , i.e. , almost orthogonal .",
    "isophotes intermediate to these two regimes are fairly circular .",
    "comparison of the colors of the elliptical with hdf galaxies with known redshifts suggests that its redshift is roughly @xmath4 ( cf .",
    "the photometric redshift of 0.5 of gwyn ( 1998 ) ) .",
    "this suggests a total luminosity in matter and no cosmological constant , and also set @xmath51 .",
    "] of @xmath52 in the rest - frame b - band , or roughly @xmath53 .",
    "the luminosity is a factor of 3 larger if @xmath54 , and a factor of 6.5 smaller if @xmath55 .",
    "we consider several models for the lensing mass distribution , simple parameterized models as well as a constant mass - to - light ratio model .",
    "the image positions are not very sensitive to the radial profile of the lens , so for the parameterized models we take it to be singular and isothermal .",
    "asymmetry is required and we consider two types , external shear or an elliptical galaxy .",
    "we assume that the arc components @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath40 are three images of a common source , with @xmath37 and @xmath38 a merging pair",
    ". component @xmath39 can easily be produced if the source is extended or multi - component .",
    "we do not include as constraints component @xmath39 or the observed flux ratios among components @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath40 , since these are sensitive to the detailed flux distribution of the source .",
    "we discuss the dot below .",
    "we consider a lens at redshift @xmath56 and a source at @xmath57 .",
    "then the lens mass distribution determines a convergence @xmath58 and a potential @xmath59 ( e.g. , schneider et al .",
    "1992 ; blandford & narayan 1992 ) . the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) is defined by @xmath60 $ ] . we add to the potential the term @xmath61 which defines an external shear of magnitude @xmath62 and direction @xmath63 .",
    "if the shear is due to an axisymmetric galaxy then it is located at an angle @xmath63 from the lens galaxy .",
    "we denote by sis@xmath64 the sis model with external shear .",
    "a singular isothermal elliptical mass distribution ( siemd ) with an axis ratio @xmath65 and a major axis along the @xmath66-axis is given by @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "more generally we rotate the major axis by an angle @xmath68 .",
    "the lensing properties of the siemd have been studied by kassiola & kovner ( 1993 ) and by kormann , schneider , & bartelmann ( 1994 ) .",
    "we fit these two lens models , the sis@xmath64 model and the siemd , to the three observed image positions , with results shown in table  [ tab : models ] .",
    "both lens models have an ellongated diamond caustic with four cusps .",
    "we indicate a source near a cusp on the major axis by [ maj ] and one near a minor cusp by [ min ] .",
    "since the observed position @xmath38 is farther from the center of the lens than @xmath37 or @xmath40 , the arc is more naturally produced by a minor cusp for which only the middle image of the three is outside the critical curve .",
    "interestingly , the orientation of the siemd[min ] model agrees with the observed orientation of the elliptical s outer isophotes , while the orientation of the siemd[maj ] model agrees with that of the inner isophotes .",
    "however , among the simple parameterized models only the sis@xmath64[min ] model fits the data well ( see table  [ tab : models ] and figure  [ fig : gamma ] ) .",
    "this model requires a substantial shear @xmath69 produced by objects lying in the ne or sw directions . to compute the mass - to - light ratio for various models",
    ", we fix a circle about the galaxy center of radius @xmath42 .",
    "the luminosity of the galaxy within this circle is @xmath70 if @xmath71 .",
    "if , e.g. , @xmath72 , then the mass within the same circle of the sis is @xmath73 .",
    "this yields a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath74 , and a velocity dispersion @xmath75 .    as a second approach to modeling ,",
    "we utilize the resolved image of the lens galaxy ( smoothed with a 4-pixel fwhm gaussian ) to construct a model with a constant mass - to - light ratio ( denoted m / l ) . the pure m / l model fails but together with external shear it produces an excellent fit , albeit with a large shear .",
    "even a small shear such as @xmath76 produces a substantially better fit than with no shear ( see table  [ tab : models ] and figure  [ fig : mtol ] ) .",
    "all the m / l models produce a minor cusp configuration .",
    "the parameter @xmath77 for the m / l models gives the mean @xmath58 in a circle of radius @xmath42 about the galaxy center .",
    "if @xmath71 and @xmath72 then the mass within this circle is @xmath78 , which yields a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath79 . if we assume a small shear then @xmath80 ( table  [ tab : models ] ) , and the mass - to - light ratio is on the high side of the range of other lens galaxies ( keeton , kochanek , & falco 1998 ) .",
    "note , however , that we only have an estimated photometric redshift for the lens and a guess for the source redshift . the mass - to - light ratio changes to @xmath81 for @xmath82 and to @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "no fourth image is detected down to the detection threshold of about 28.9 mag in @xmath11 .",
    "this is consistent with the models , which predict a fourth image fainter than the third by a factor of 3 or 4 .",
    "the m / l models are non - singular and predict a fifth image fainter by an additional factor of @xmath85 .",
    "the best - fitting models also locate the image of the cusp near the observed position of component @xmath39 , so this component can be produced if the source is extended .",
    "thus far we have not included the dot , assuming it to be a separate background source .",
    "we consider also the possibility that the dot is the third image corresponding to components @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the types of lens models used above can fit these alternative image positions with similar @xmath86 values as in table 3 , but they fail since they predict an observable arc which includes counter images of components @xmath39 and @xmath40 and extends south - east from the dot . more elaborate lens models could work but only if the sources of components @xmath39 and @xmath40 are small ( subpixel ) and lie right on the caustic .",
    "we have modeled a candidate gravitational lens , , found in the hdf - s .",
    "the image positions can be fit in a minor cusp configuration by simple lens models which include ellipticity or shear , or with shear added to a model with a constant mass - to - light ratio .",
    "however , an exact fit is obtained only with a substantial shear produced by objects lying to the ne or sw .",
    "no obvious candidate galaxy lies within @xmath87 of the lens , but there are several galaxies @xmath88 to the sw and others @xmath89 to the ne with photometric redshifts in the range 0.50.7 ( gwyn 1998 ) .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts will determine the possible presence of galaxy groups .",
    "the lensing galaxy is expected to have a redshift @xmath90 , which gives it a luminosity of @xmath91 .",
    "lens models imply a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath92 , and a velocity dispersion of @xmath5 .",
    "if the elliptical falls on the fundamental plane , a central line - of - sight velocity dispersion of only @xmath93 is expected if @xmath4 ( jorgensen , franx & kjaergaard 1996 ) , which suggests that @xmath94 is more likely .",
    "showing that the arc and the lens galaxy are at different redshifts would rule out the possibility that the arc is a tidally disrupted satelite .",
    "on 10-m  class telescopes , it is straightforward to get spectroscopic redshifts of galaxies at @xmath95  mag , even elliptical galaxies which tend to have absorption - feature dominated spectra ( cohen et al .",
    "1998 ) . some elliptical galaxies at this flux level",
    "even have measured central velocity dispersions ( van  dokkum et al .",
    "1998 ; pahre 1998 ) .",
    "thus the prospects for follow - up spectroscopy on the elliptical are good .",
    "it is common to obtain redshifts for sources at @xmath96  mag , even some which are close to bright nearby sources ( steidel et al .",
    "a redshift for the arc is likely obtainable if it is at @xmath97 since its blue color suggests that it will show strong emission lines in a visual spectrum ( hogg et al .",
    "the arc is unlikely to be at redshift @xmath98 since it shows significant @xmath9 flux .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank bob williams and the entire hdf - s team for taking , reducing , and making public the beautiful images of the hdf - s .",
    "scott burles , wayne hu and inger joergensen provided very useful help in short order .",
    "we thank the referee emilio falco for useful comments .",
