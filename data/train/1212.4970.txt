    "the perovskite cobaltites recoo@xmath4 ( re = rare - earth element and y ) show a spin - state ( ss ) transition of co@xmath7 ions from a low spin state ( ls ; @xmath8 , @xmath9=0 ) to a high spin state ( hs ; @xmath10 , @xmath9=2 ) with increasing temperature , followed by the formation of the metallic state of the intermediate spin state ( is ; @xmath11 , @xmath9=1 ) at higher temperatures .",
    "@xcite the temperature induced spin - state transition and its gradual course indicate a small energy difference @xmath12 between the crystal - field splitting and hund coupling energy .",
    "@xcite the hole - doped systems like la@xmath13sr@xmath14coo@xmath4 generally show a temperature stable phase with itinerant cobalt states ( presumably the mixed is co@xmath7/ ls co@xmath15 or hs co@xmath7/ is co@xmath15 configurations ) and undergo a ferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures .",
    "most interestingly , some pr - based cobaltites exhibit a pronounced first - order transition to a low - temperature phase of weakly paramagnetic character and reduced conduction .",
    "this transition is referred in the literature as the metal - insulator ( mi ) transition , because of the large resistivity change making one or two orders of magnitude and its sharpness .",
    "it was revealed for the first time on pr@xmath16ca@xmath16coo@xmath4 at @xmath5@xmath17  k , and was documented , in addition to the step - like resistivity jump , by concomitant anomalies in the magnetic susceptibility , heat capacity and lattice dilatation .",
    "@xcite the change in the electronic structure was confirmed at @xmath5 by the photoemission spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite the mechanism of the transition was tentatively ascribed to a spin - state crossover from the itinerant cobalt states to an ordered mixture of localized ls co@xmath7 and ls co@xmath15 ( @xmath18 , @xmath9=1/2 ) states .",
    "thereafter , the existence of co@xmath7/co@xmath15 ordering was questioned because similar transition was evidenced also in the less doped pr@xmath13ca@xmath14coo@xmath4 ( @xmath19=0.3 ) under high pressures ,  @xcite or in the ( pr@xmath1re@xmath20ca@xmath14coo@xmath4 system ( 0.2@xmath210.5 ) with a partial substitution of pr by smaller re cations such as sm , eu and y under ambient pressure .",
    "@xcite this mi transition accompanied by ss transition appeared to be conditioned not only by the presence of both pr and ca ions , but also by a larger structural distortion of the coo@xmath22 network , depending on the average ionic radius and size mismatch of perovskite _",
    "a_-site ions .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the critical temperature @xmath5 was found to be depressed by the applied magnetic field .",
    "@xcite    an alternative scenario explaining the nature of such specific transition was proposed on the basis of electronic structure calculations exploiting the temperature dependence of the structural experimental data for pr@xmath16ca@xmath16coo@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite it appeared that the formal cobalt valence should change below @xmath5 from mixed - valence co@xmath23 towards pure co@xmath7 with strong preference for the ls state and , concomitantly , the praseodymium valence should increase simultaneously from pr@xmath7 towards pr@xmath15 .",
    "the ss transition and electronic localization was thus intuitively interpreted as an analogy of the compositional transition from the ferromagnetic metal of la@xmath16ca@xmath16coo@xmath4 to the diamagnetic insulator of lacoo@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite shortly afterwards , the theoretical hypothesis about the crucial role of variable praseodymium valence was experimentally supported by observation of a schottky peak in the low - temperature specific heat of ( pr@xmath1y@xmath2ca@xmath3coo@xmath4 ( @xmath6=0.075 and 0.15 ) ,  @xcite which proved a stabilization of kramers pr@xmath15 ions in the low - temperature phase .",
    "most recently , we directly confirmed the praseodymium valence shift , realized in fact as a mixture of the pr@xmath7 and pr@xmath15 states , from the x - ray absorption near - edge structure ( xanes ) spectra at the pr @xmath0-edge for the same ( pr@xmath1y@xmath2ca@xmath3coo@xmath4 samples .  @xcite it has been found that the average valence of the praseodymium ion increases below room temperature from the common value 3.0 + , undergoes a steepest change at @xmath5 and reaches finally 3.15 + and 3.27 + at 8 k for the @xmath6=0.075 and 0.15 samples , respectively .",
    "interestingly , these values are consistent with those estimated by quantitative analysis of the entropy associated with the schottky peak dominating the low - temperature specific heat . for pr@xmath16ca@xmath16coo@xmath4 ,",
    "similar valence shifts from 3.0 + at 300 k to 3.15 + at 10 k were obtained by other authors using xanes at pr @xmath0 and @xmath24 edges .",

    "\\(1 ) in all the studied pr - based cobaltites , the trivalent praseodymium ions change to a pr@xmath7/pr@xmath15 mixture below @xmath5 , which anticipates that , at the same time , the formal cobalt valence should decrease from 3.3 + closer to 3.0 + .",

    "the average valence determined at 8 k makes 3.03 + and 3.25 + for the tb and pr ion , respectively .",
    "the calculated co valence is 3.156 + in this case .",
    "it should be noted that these results do not necessarily mean very different tendencies of the two rare - earth ions for tetravalent states , since the final valence balance in such chemically inhomogeneous systems depends also on steric factors , including the size mismatch at perovskite @xmath82-sites .",
    "\\(3 ) the observed valence shift of tb ion indicates the energy closeness of trivalent and tetravalent states in this rare earth .",

    "\\(4 ) in the ( pr@xmath1re@xmath2ca@xmath3coo@xmath4 samples ( re = sm and eu ) with similar mi - ss transition , no valence shift of the re ion is detected at the re ion absorption edge in the xanes spectra .",
    "this suggests that eu@xmath7 and sm@xmath7 are stable in the system over the entire temperature range , and may signify that the energy closeness of trivalent and divalent states in these rare earths has no effect on the praseodymium / cobalt valence equilibria .",
