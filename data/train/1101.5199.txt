    "the accelerating expansion has been supported by observations of supernova observations @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) , and the large scale structure through the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) . however , the physical origin of acceleration is still a challenging mystery . within the framework of general relativity ,",
    "this can be interpreted by a cosmic dark energy with negative pressure .",
    "the simplest dark energy model is the cosmological constant ( @xmath8cdm ) , where the vacuum energy is responsible for the accelerating expansion .",
    "whereas , it suffers from two problems degenerately .",
    "the first is the fine - tuning problem : the observed vacuum energy density of order @xmath9 gev@xmath10 is about @xmath11 orders of magnitude smaller than the value expected by quantum field theory for a cut - off scale being the plank scale , and is still about @xmath12 orders smaller even for a cut - off scale being the qcd scale @xcite .",
    "the second is the coincidence problem : the conditions in the early universe have to be set very carefully in order for the energy density of the vacuum and that of the matter to be comparable today . to solve these problems , abundances of dynamical dark energy models",
    "have been proposed , such as scalar field @xcite , vector field @xcite , and decaying vacuum energy @xcite , holographic dark energy model @xcite and so on ( see @xcite for details ) . in quintessence of scalar field",
    ", the lagrangian density has a standard form @xmath13 , which contains a canonical kinetic term and a potential term .",
    "some particular forms of the potentials of quintessence @xcite or the coupled quintessence with dark matter @xcite , can not only lead to the late time acceleration of the universe , but also avoid the coincidence problem .",
    "as well known , the quintessence always has an equation of state ( eos ) @xmath0 larger than @xmath1 .",
    "however , there have been some preliminary evidences that the current value of @xmath0 may be less than @xmath1 , as indicated from observations @xcite . on the other hand , the phantom field with a negative kinetic energy @xcite",
    "predicts a eos being always smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , another scalar field model with a noncanonical kinetic term called k - essence was proposed @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian is generally taken to be @xmath14 , where @xmath15 . in @xcite , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is a polynomial of @xmath18 , leading to @xmath19 for @xmath20 as a quintessence and @xmath21 for @xmath22 as a phantom . for the considerations of the eos of dark energy tracking that of the background , one expect that the eos of dark energy may be lager than @xmath1 in early times and smaller than @xmath1 in late times ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath0 crosses @xmath1 .",
    "if this is supported by further observations , many dark energy models would undergo a problem .",
    "note that , even in k - essence model , @xmath0 can not cross @xmath1 for a fixed @xmath23 .",
    "is it possible to have a transit from quintessence to phantom ?",
    "the particular interacting phantom dark energy could give smooth transit from @xmath24 to @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the non - minimal interaction between dark matter and dark energy with a single scalar field could also make possible to do the crossing of the phantom divide @xcite .",
    "besides , based on employment of two scalar fields , a class of models have been proposed , thereby using extra degrees of freedom @xcite .    in this paper , we propose to study a new dark energy model described by a single scalar field , whose lagrangian density contains a logarithmic factor .",
    "we call it _ effective scalar field _ ( esf ) dark energy model .",
    "since the kinetic energy term is noncanonical , it should belong to a subclass of k - essence models .",
    "this is inspired by our previous work on the quantum effective yang - mills condensate ( ymc ) dark energy model @xcite with @xmath26 for 1-loop case @xcite , where @xmath27 is the squared gauge field strength @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear kinetic terms appear generically in the effective action in string and supergravity theories @xcite .",
    "the appearance of a logarithmic correction in the field is generic for effective quantum theories , e.g. , the coleman - weinberg potential @xcite , the effective gravity @xcite , as well as the effective yang - mills field @xcite .",
    "since the nature of dark energy is still unknown , in the following , we will investigate the phenomenological properties of esf model .",
    "based on the observation of nearby galaxies @xcite , an interaction between dark energy and dark matter is favored since it would give a more rapid structure formation than predicted by the @xmath8cdm model @xcite .",
    "so , we will also generally consider that an interaction between dark energy and matter exists .",
    "as will be seen , with one scalar field , the model provides a smooth dynamical transit from quintessence to phantom , with its @xmath28 going from @xmath29 at high reshifts to @xmath30 at low redshifts , if the field decays into matter .",
    "all the physical quantities involved in the model are smooth during the whole dynamical evolution .",
    "moreover , the coincidence problem is also avoided in this model , since it has a stable attractor solution .",
    "but , unfortunately , the fine - tuning problem is still exist since a model parameter has to be tuned to accord with the low density of the dark energy component obtained through observations",
    ". we will demonstrate these afore - mentioned points , and also carry out a joint @xmath31 analysis for the model , confronting it with recent observations from sn ia @xcite , bao peak measurement of large scale structure from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite and the two degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) @xcite , the shift parameter of cmb @xcite , and the history of the hubble parameter @xcite . throughout this paper , we adopt a unit with @xmath32 .",

    "the dark energy is described by a scalar field @xmath42 with a lagrangian density @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 is a function of @xmath42 , @xmath23 is a scale of energy density to be fixed by observations , and @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 in eq.([langrangian ] ) is formally similar to the lagrangian density of the 1-loop effective ymc dark energy model @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath42 is homogeneous and isotropic , and only depends on time , i.e. , @xmath48 .",
    "the action is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "the variation of the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to @xmath42 gives @xmath51 where a dot denotes @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "note that , eq.([fieldeq ] ) differs from that of the quintessence model by the extra term @xmath54 .",
    "when a coupling exists between esf and matter , their dynamical evolution equations are given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the energy transformation rate from esf to matter .",
    "for simplicity , we assume @xmath56 is a constant . the radiation is an independent component and evolves as @xmath57 .    in the following we focus on the simple case of @xmath58 .",
    "the energy density and pressure are easily gained by the variation of action ( [ action ] ) with respect to @xmath59 : @xmath60 with @xmath61 required by @xmath62 .",
    "it is easy to prove that , for the non - coupled case ( @xmath63 ) , eq .",
    "( [ phicoupling ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ fieldeq ] ) with the help of eq .",
    "( [ rhophi1 ] ) .",
    "the eos is given by @xmath64 in high energy limit with @xmath65 , @xmath66 , different from the high energy behavior @xmath67 of the ymc model @xcite .",
    "at the critical point @xmath68 , one has @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath25 will be arrived when @xmath70 .",
    "introducing dimensionless @xmath71 and @xmath72 , eqs .",

    "( [ scalar ] ) and ( [ matter ] ) can be solved for each @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath81 means that dark energy decays into matter , and vice versa . in this paper",
    ", we assume that @xmath80 is positive , since @xmath82 will lead to a negative matter density in the future , which is unacceptable from the point of view of physics .",
    "firstly , we would like to discuss the simple case of the non - coupled @xmath83 esf model . to ensure the standard cosmology not being spoiled by the presence of dark energy ,",
    "one may take @xmath84 at @xmath85 .",
    "the outcome is that , for any @xmath78 in a wide range @xmath86 corresponding to @xmath87 ranging over almost infinity orders of magnitude , the current status ( @xmath88 ) is always attained .",
    "so the coincidence problem is solved at the price of choosing a fixed @xmath23 . as can be seen in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "( a ) , different initial values of @xmath89 , lead to the same density of the esf at present time . during earlier stages",
    "the decreasing @xmath90 is subdominant to @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "note that @xmath90 always levels off at a certain time , earlier for a smaller @xmath78 .",
    "then , it surpasses @xmath40 at @xmath93 and surpasses @xmath39 at @xmath94 , respectively . whereas , the matter density @xmath95 evolves independently as @xmath96 , since it does not couple with the esf .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] ( b ) shows that @xmath0 will decrease and increase with time and approach @xmath1 at the late - time for @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "moreover , for @xmath99 , the esf acts as the @xmath8cdm model exactly .",
    "note that , in the above three cases , all the corresponding @xmath0 will stay at @xmath1 in the future and never cross @xmath1 .",
    "it can be understood as follows . for @xmath100 , eq .",
    "( [ scalar ] ) has a solution : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is an integration constant determined by the initial conditions . except the particular case that @xmath68",
    ", @xmath102 is always positive , i.e. , the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) will always be larger than 0 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath103 will never cross 0 no matter the initial value of @xmath103 is positive or negative .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ eos ] ) , we know that @xmath0 can not cross @xmath1 resulting from @xmath103 failing to cross @xmath104 . in the special case of @xmath99 , @xmath102 is fixed to be zero .",
    "thus , @xmath68 will be kept all the time , i.e. , @xmath69 is constant . since @xmath105 decays with the expansion universe as @xmath106 , @xmath107 at @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the critical density of the universe .",
    "we find that , for the whole range of @xmath78 , the resulting dynamical evolution in the recent past @xmath111 is almost identical to that in @xmath8cdm with deviations @xmath112 .",

    "( a ) @xmath90 , @xmath92 , and @xmath91 in the non - coupled esf model . for various initial values @xmath78 the current status @xmath120 and @xmath121 is always achieved .",

    "the initial conditions for the esf and radiation are chosen the same as the case of non - coupled esf .",
    "the initial condition for the matter is chosen a little differently from the non - coupled case in order to ensure the current status ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "as illustrated in fig.[fig2 ] ( a ) , the coincidence problem is also avoided in this case .",
    "the dynamic evolutions of the density of the coupled esf are quite similar to those in the non - coupled esf .",
    "however , @xmath39 levels off around @xmath123 and will approach a constant instead of decaying as @xmath124 .",
    "this is caused by the coupling @xmath125 .",
    "[ fig2](b ) plots evolutions of the corresponding @xmath122 . due to the coupling , @xmath0 crosses @xmath1 , arrives at @xmath126 at present , and settles down to a constant value @xmath127 in future .",
    "the influence of the coupling @xmath80 has been investigated , and computations show that a greater @xmath80 yields a larger matter fraction @xmath128 and a smaller eos @xmath129 at present .",
    "we have also found an interesting relation : @xmath130 as @xmath115 , which is similar to ymc model @xcite .",
    "this implies that the total eos satisfies @xmath131 as @xmath115 .",
    "thus , the coupled esf model also predicts an exact de sitter expansion in future , and the big rip event is avoided naturally .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 in this case are determined by setting @xmath132 at @xmath108 , leading to @xmath133 .",
    "unfortunately , the particular choices of @xmath23 being the same order of magnitude as @xmath110 let the esf model still suffer from the fine - tuning problem .",
    "we have carried out an analysis of dynamic stability of the set of eqs .",
    "( [ scalar ] ) and ( [ matter ] ) , and found that it has the fixed point @xmath134 for @xmath100 and @xmath135 for @xmath5 , respectively , as @xmath136 .",

    "thus , the fixed points are stable , and then the attractor solutions of @xmath142 are obtained for the above two cases . aside the trajectory smoothness in phase space , the stability is problematic in single scalar field models @xcite . moreover , all the physical quantities in our models , such as @xmath36 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 , are smooth from the initial moment up to the future .",
