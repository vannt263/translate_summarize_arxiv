    "in this paper we investigate the problem of deleting vertices from a given graph so as to ensure that all simple paths in the remaining graph are short .",
    "we assume that each vertex has a nonnegative weight , and we want to delete vertices of small total weight . whereas there is an extensive literature on separators , which can be viewed as serving to destroy all large connected components , we are not aware of previous work on vertex sets that destroy all long simple paths .",

    "of course , it suffices to demonstrate this for @xmath13 larger than an arbitrary constant .",
    "not every family of graphs is trimmable .",
    "for example , if @xmath14 and we delete a @xmath15-fraction of the vertices in an unweighted @xmath16-clique @xmath17 , the remaining graph still has a simple path of @xmath18 edges .",
    "this expression is not bounded by a function of @xmath13 alone , so the family of complete graphs is not trimmable .    with a little effort , one can show the family of trees to be trimmable .",
    "one popular generalization of trees is based on the definition below .",
    "given a graph @xmath8 and a set @xmath9 , we denote by @xmath19 $ ] the subgraph of @xmath11 induced by  @xmath12 .",
    "the _ union _ of graphs @xmath20 , for @xmath21 , is the graph @xmath22 .",

    "the _ width _ of the tree decomposition @xmath23 is @xmath34 , and the _ treewidth _ of @xmath11 is the smallest width of any tree decomposition of  @xmath11 .",
    "this standard definition is given , e.g. , by bodlaender  @xcite . the family of graphs of treewidth at most  1 coincides with the family of forests .",
    "by analogy with several other generalizations from the family of trees to families of graphs of bounded treewidth , it seems natural to ask whether every family of graphs of bounded treewidth is trimmable . at present",
    "we can not answer this question ; we need a concept stronger than bounded treewidth alone .",

    "the 1-elongation treewidth is the _ domino treewidth _ studied , e.g. , by bodlaender  @xcite .",
    "our main result about graph trimming , proved in section  [ sec : trim ] , is that for all fixed @xmath35 , every family of graphs of bounded @xmath36-elongation treewidth is trimmable .",
    "ding and oporowski  @xcite proved that the domino treewidth of a graph can be bounded by a function of its usual treewidth and its maximum degree .",
    "it follows that every family of graphs of bounded treewidth and bounded degree is also trimmable .",
    "we derive from this that all families of planar graphs of bounded degree are trimmable as well .",
    "this result has applications described below .",
    "our main motivation for investigating trimmable graph families arose in the context of labeling maps with sliding labels . generally speaking ,",
    "map labeling is the problem of placing a set of labels , each in the vicinity of the object that it labels , while meeting certain conditions . for an overview , see the map - labeling bibliography @xcite .",
    "first of all , labels are not allowed to overlap .",
    "as a consequence , it may not be possible to label all objects in a map , and the goal is to make an optimal selection according to some criterion .",
    "when a point feature such as a town or a mountain top is to be labeled , the label can usually be approximated without much loss by an axes - parallel rectangular shape and must be placed in the plane without rotation so that its boundary touches the point .",
    "one distinguishes between _ fixed - position models _ and _ slider models_. in fixed - position models , each label has a predetermined finite set of _ anchor points _ on its boundary ( e.g. , the four corner points ) , and the label must be placed so that one of its anchor points coincides with the point to be labeled . in slider models , the anchor points form _ anchor segments _ on the boundary of the label ( e.g. , its bottom edge ) .",
    "van kreveld et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a taxonomy of fixed - position and slider models , which was later refined by poon et al .",
    "we use the slider models 1sh , 2sh and 4s of poon et al . , which define the anchor segments of a label to be its bottom edge , its top and bottom edges , and its entire boundary , respectively .",
    "we always require labels to be unit - height rectangles .",
    "this models the case in which all labels contain single text lines of the same character height . fig .",
    "1 illustrates the 1sh model .",
    "we assume that each point to be labeled comes equipped with a nonnegative weight , which may be used to express priorities among the points .",
    "if points represent villages , towns and cities on a map , priorities may correspond to the number of inhabitants , for example .",
    "our objective is to label points with nonoverlapping labels so as to maximize the sum of the weights of those points that actually receive a label .",
    "this objective function causes points with large weights ( e.g. , large cities ) to be likely to be labeled .",
    "we refer to the specific map - labeling problems described in this paragraph as _ weighted unit - height 1sh - labeling _ , etc .",
    "since the qualifiers `` weighted '' and `` unit - height '' apply throughout the paper , we may occasionally omit them .    ]",
    "recall that for @xmath37 , a _",
    "@xmath38-approximation algorithm _ for a maximization problem is an algorithm that always outputs a solution of value at least @xmath38 times the optimal objective value .",
    "an algorithm that takes an additional parameter @xmath39 and , for each fixed @xmath40 , is a polynomial - time @xmath41-approximation algorithm is called a _ polynomial - time approximation scheme _ ( _ ptas _ ) .",

    "@xcite show that finding an optimal weighted unit - height 1sh - labeling is np - hard , even if all points lie on a horizontal line and the weight of each point equals the length of its label .",
    "for the one - dimensional case , in which all points lie on a horizontal line , they give an fptas , which yields an @xmath42-time @xmath43-approximation algorithm for the two - dimensional case for arbitrary @xmath39 .",
    "poon et al .  also describe a ptas for unit - square labels .",
    "they raise the question of whether a ptas exists for rectangular labels of arbitrary length and unit height .",
    "this is known to be the case for fixed - position models @xcite and for sliding labels of unit weight @xcite .",
    "the corresponding @xmath41-approximation algorithms run in @xmath44 and @xmath45 time , respectively , for arbitrary @xmath39 .",
    "the question of whether the combination of both sliding labels and arbitrary weights allows a ptas has been one of the last major open problems in ( theoretical point - feature ) map labeling . in a preliminary version of this paper @xcite",
    ", we made some progress in answering this question .",
    "we gave a @xmath46-approximation for weighted unit - height 1sh - labeling with running time @xmath45 , for arbitrary @xmath39 , and showed that the same approach yields a ptas if the ratio of longest to shortest label length is bounded .",
    "in section  [ sec : labeling ] we settle the open question of poon et al .  by presenting a ptas for weighted unit - height 1sh - labeling .",
    "there are no restrictions on label weights and lengths .",
    "our approach is to discretize a given instance  @xmath47 of the weighted unit - height 1sh - labeling problem , i.e. , to turn it into a fixed - position instance @xmath48 , after which we can apply a known fixed - position algorithm to  @xmath48 .",
    "the main difficulty is to find a `` suitable '' set of discrete label positions for each point . `` suitable ''",
    "means that the weight of an optimal labeling of @xmath48 must be close enough to the weight of an optimal labeling of @xmath47 .",
    "dependencies between labels can be modeled via a graph , and long simple paths in this graph translate into large sets of anchor points that can not be left out of consideration . here",
    "our results from section  [ sec : trim ] come into play .",
    "we prove that the family of dependency graphs , if carefully defined , is trimmable , and we show how this may be used to bound the number of anchor points by a polynomial .",
    "we also show how to extend our ptas for ( weighted unit - weight ) 1sh - labeling to the related 2sh - labeling and 4s - labeling problems .",
    "in this section we show that for every constant  @xmath36 , every family of graphs of bounded @xmath36-elongation treewidth is trimmable .",

    "it is easy to observe that in every normalized labeling , the position of each label ( taken to be the @xmath26-coordinate of its left edge ) is the sum of the @xmath26-coordinate of some labeled point and some number of label lengths , minus its own length .",
    "this still leaves too many possibilities , however , since essentially every selection of points to receive labels may give rise to a different position of a given label .",

    "@xmath11 : if the label of a point @xmath165 , moving left , may bump into that of a point  @xmath138 , then  @xmath11 includes the edge @xmath157 . the problem identified above stems from the fact that  @xmath11 may have very long paths , corresponding to chains of many labels that may touch and influence each other .",
    "our defense against this is trimming , so we must ensure that @xmath11 is trimmable . assuming that this is so",

    "this gives rise to another problem , in that the re - normalization may create new long paths . in order to counter this ,",
    "we introduce vertical _ stopping lines _ and modify the normalization to never push the left edge of a label past a stopping line . as long as at least one stopping line passes through each dropped label ( including its boundary ) , we can be sure that the re - normalization creates no new paths . fairly arbitrarily , for every label , we choose to put stopping lines through the left and right edges of the area occupied by the label in its leftmost position ( if no other labels obstruct its movement ) .",

    "@xmath166 can not influence labels with their left edge to the right of or on  @xmath166 , so we can remove all edges from @xmath11 that cross a stopping line .",
    "this turns out to have the beneficial effect of making @xmath11 planar and of bounded degree , which implies that it is trimmable , as needed above .    by attaching real - valued lengths to the edges of @xmath11 and adding an additional vertex  @xmath167 with incident edges described below to @xmath11",
