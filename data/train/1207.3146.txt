    "the problem of characterizing the capacity region of a broadcast channel ( bc ) was proposed by cover @xcite in 1972 , and he introduced a novel coding technique to derive achievable rate regions for particular degraded bcs . in a seminal work aimed at deriving an achievable rate region for the general degraded bc ,",
    "bergmans @xcite generalized cover s technique into what is currently referred to as superposition coding .",
    "gallager @xcite and bergmans @xcite concurrently and independently proved optimality of superposition coding for the class of degraded bcs .",
    "this in particular yielded capacity region for the scalar additive gaussian bc . however , the case of general discrete bc ( dbc ) remained open .",
    "this ( problem ) led to the discovery of another ingenious coding technique .",
    "gelfand @xcite proposed an ingenious coding technique for a particular 2-dbc . in 1979 , marton @xcite proposed the technique of binning . in conjunction with superposition , she derived the largest known achievable rate region for the general two user dbc ( 2-dbc ) . a generalization ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 10(c ) ) of superposition and binning to incorporate a common message is the largest known achievable rate region for the general 2-dbc and it s capacity is yet unknown .",
    "though the capacity region has been found for many interesting classes of bcs @xcite , the question of whether the rate region derived by marton is optimal for the general dbc has remained open for over thirty years . following a period of reduced activity ,",
    "there has been renewed interest @xcite in settling this question .",
    "gohari and anantharam @xcite have proved computability of marton s rate region .",
    "this enabled them identify a class of binary 2-dbcs for which marton s @xcite rate region",
    "when computed is strictly smaller than the tightest known outer bound @xcite , which is due to nair and el gamal . on the other hand , weingarten , steinberg and shamai @xcite",
    "have proved marton s binning ( also referred to , in the gaussian setting , as costa s dirty paper coding @xcite ) to be optimal for gaussian mimo bc , and thereby characterized capacity region for the particular class of gaussian vector bcs .",
    "we remark @xcite proves optimality of marton s binning technique for gaussian vector bcs with arbitrary number of receivers .    in this article , ( 1 ) we propose a coding technique based on nested coset codes , an ensemble of codes endowed with algebraic structure , that enables us ( 2 ) present an achievable rate region for the general three user dbc ( 3-dbc ) , and thereby ( 3 ) strictly enlarge the current known largest achievable rate region .",
    "we characterize to1bc dbcs , a class of 3-dbcs for which marton s coding technique is proved to be strictly sub - optimal .",
    "in particular , we identify a novel to1bc dbc for which the proposed coding technique yields achievable , a rate triple not contained within marton s rate region .",
    "we remark that the to1bc dbc presented herein is the first known bc for which the natural generalization of marton s coding technique is strictly sub - optimal .",
    "indeed , one of the key elements of our work is an analytical proof of sub - optimality of marton s rate region for this 3-dbc .",
    "our findings emphasize the need for codes endowed with algebraic structure for communicating over a general multi - terminal communication setting",
    ".    why do codes endowed with algebraic structure outperform traditional independent unstructured codes for a bc ?",
    "the central aspect of a coding technique designed for a bc is interference management .",
    "marton s coding incorporates two techniques - superposition and binning - for tackling interference .",
    "superposition enables each user decode a _ univariate _ component of the other user s signal and thus subtract it off .",
    "binning enables the encoder counter the component of each user s interfering signal not decoded by the other , by precoding for the same .",
    "except for particular cases , the most popular being dirty paper coding , precoding results in a rate loss , and is therefore less efficient than decoding the interfering signal at the decoder .",
    "the presence of a rate loss motivates each decoder to decode as large a part of interference as possible . however decoding a large part of the interference constrains the individual rates . in a three user bc , each user s reception",
    "is plagued by interference caused by signals intended for the other two users .",
    "the interference is in general a bi - variate function of signals intended for the other users .",
    "if the signals of the two users are endowed with structure that can help compress the range of this bi - variate function when applied to all possible signals , then the receivers can decode a large part of the interfering signal .",
    "this minimizes the component of the interference precoded , and therefore the rate loss .",
    "this is where codebooks endowed with algebraic structure outperform unstructured independent codebooks .",
    "indeed , linear codes constrain the interference pattern to an affine subspace if the interference is the sum of user 2 and 3 s signals .",
    "it is our belief that additional degrees of freedom prevalent in a three user information theoretic problem can be harnessed with codebooks endowed with algebraic structure .",
    "whether structure in codebooks can be exploited for a two user problem remains open .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "we begin with preliminaries in section [ sec : broadcastchanneldefinitionsmartonrateregion ] . in particular , we provide relevant definition for a dbc and state marton s achievable rate region . in section [ sec:3to1bcandtheneedforstructuredcodes ] , describe a 3-dbc for which marton s coding technique is strictly suboptimal and generalize this example into a class of 3-dbcs called to1bc dbcs .",
    "we present our achievable rate region for the general 3-dbc in three steps . in the first two steps , presented in section [ sec : achievablerateregionsfor3to1bcusingnestedcosetcodes ] , we present achievable rate regions for a to1bc dbc .",
    "the final step , where we derive an achievable rate region for a general 3-dbc , is presented in section [ sec : achievablerateregionfor3bcusingnestedcosetcodes ] .",
    "the proof of strict sub - optimality of marton s coding technique for the to1bc dbc is detailed in section [ sec : strictsuboptimalityofmartoncodingtechnique ] , appendices [ appsec : characterizationfornoratelossinptp - stx ] , [ appsec : thebinaryadditivedirtypointtopointchannelsuffersarateloss ] . in section",
    "[ sec : enlargingmartonsrateregionusingnestedcosetcodes ] , we indicate structure of a coding technique that yields the largest known achievable rate region for the 3-dbc which subsumes all of the known achievable rate regions .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : concludingremarks ] by pointing at fundamental connection between the several layers of coding in a three user communication problem and common parts of a triple of random variables , thereby arguing the inherent role played by structured codes in information theory .",
    "the reader solely interested in proof of strict sub - optimality of marton s coding technique may read through sections [ sec : broadcastchanneldefinitionsmartonrateregion ] , [ subsec : limitationsofunstructuredcodes ] , [ subsec : thethreeuserbroadcastchannel ] and skip over to section [ sec : strictsuboptimalityofmartoncodingtechnique ] without missing out on any necessary elements .",
    "however , we encourage the reader to peruse the proposed coding technique based on nested coset codes .    while sections [ sec : broadcastchanneldefinitionsmartonrateregion]-[sec : strictsuboptimalityofmartoncodingtechnique ] contain all the technical details presented in this article",
    ", we encourage the reader to read through section [ sec : roleofstructuredcodesinnetworkinformationtheory ] for an account of the role of structured codes in network information theory .",
    "in this article , we demonstrate the role of algebraic structure through the simplest example of structured codes - linear codes - that contain a bivariate function - sum - of transmitted codewords to an affine space , thereby leaving sufficient room for generalization using other algebraic objects .",
    "in particular , we employ the ensemble of nested coset codes @xcite to derive a new achievable rate region for the _ general _ 3-dbc . indeed , analyzing the proposed coding technique for a _ general _ 3-dbc requires joint typical encoding and decoding .",
    "one of the key elements of our study is therefore the interplay of joint typical encoding and decoding of statistically correlated codebooks resulting in new proof techniques .",
    "while we do not provide proofs in this article , we refer the curious reader to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proof of theorem 2 ) , ( * ? ? ? * proof of theorem 1 ) that contain several of these techniques .    the astute reader will question the case when the bi - variate function is not a sum . towards answering this question",
    ", we consider a natural generalization of linear codes to sets with looser algebraic structure such as groups . our investigation of group codes , kernels of group homomorphisms , to improve achievable rate regions for information theoretic problems has been pursued in a concurrent research thread @xcite .",
    "are operated under the group operation , the range of the resulting codebook lies between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "pseudo group codes are of interest since they outperform group codes for point to point communication . ]",
    "containing the sum of transmitted codewords using linear codes is just the first step , and we envision an achievable rate region involving a union over all algebraic objects pertaining to the several bivariate functions .",
    "the role of structured codes for improving information theoretic rate regions began with the ingenious technique of krner and marton @xcite proposed for the source coding problem of reconstructing modulo@xmath2 sum of distributed binary sources .",
    "han and kobayashi @xcite categorized a class of function reconstruction problems for which krner and marton s technique provided strict gains over the largest known rate regions using unstructured codes .",
    "ahlswede and han @xcite proposed a universal coding technique that brings together coding techniques based on unstructured and structured codes sum of a class of binary sources . ] .",
    "more recently , there is a wider interest @xcite in developing coding techniques for particular problem instances that perform better than the best known techniques based on unstructured codes .",
    "philosof and zamir @xcite employ nested linear codes to communicate over a particular binary doubly dirty multiple access channel ( mac ) and analytically prove strict sub - optimality of best known coding technique based on unstructured independent codes .",
    "bresler , parekh and tse @xcite study the problem of characterizing approximate capacity of many - to - one gaussian interference channels and demonstrate the need for lattice codes .",
    "sridharan et .",
    "@xcite employ lattice based scheme to prove achievability of rates not contained within the largest known achievable rate region using unstructured independent codes .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , in the setting of distributed source coding that for every any non - trivial and truly bi - variate function , there exists at least one source distribution for which linear codes outperform random codes , even then , it was largely believed that codebooks possessing algebraic structure can be exploited only for modulo additive channel and source coding problems .",
    "indeed , linear codes were known to be sub optimal for communicating over arbitrary point to point channels @xcite ( and similarly for lossy compression of sources subject to an arbitrary distortion ) , and therefore , the basic building block in the coding scheme for any multi - terminal communication problem could not be filled by linear codes . for over thirty years , since the work of krner and marton came to light , neither did we know of a coding technique based on unstructured codes that performed as well , nor did we know of a framework for coding based on structured codes for which the above findings was a particular case .",
    "krithivasan and pradhan @xcite have proposed the ensemble of nested coset codes as the basic building block of algebraic codes for compressing sources subject to any arbitrary distortion .",
    "they employ this ensemble to propose a framework for communicating information from distributed encoders observing correlated sources to a centralized decoder .",
    "firstly , this framework generalizes the technique proposed by krner and marton for the general problem of distributed function computation , joint quantization of distributed sources etc .",
    "secondly , in conjunction with the berger tung @xcite technique this strictly enlarges the largest known achievable rate region for the problem of distributed function computation . in the same spirit , we proposed the ensemble of nested coset codes @xcite as an ensemble of codes possessing algebraic structure that achieves capacity of arbitrary point to point channels .",
    "we employed this ensemble to ( i ) elevate the technique proposed by philosof and zamir to derive a new achievable rate region @xcite for an arbitrary discrete multiple access channel with distributed states ( ii ) derive a new achievable rate region for the general discrete three user interference channel @xcite .",

    "let us say @xmath409 .",
    "this indicates , _",
    "@xmath75codebook is built such that , the range of these univariate functions when applied on the collection of codewords in this stack , is contained . _",
    "how did marton accomplish this containment ?",
    "marton proposed building the @xmath410codebook first , followed by conditional codebooks over @xmath411 .",
    "conditional coding with a careful choice of order therefore contained the range under the action of univariate function .",
    "how is all of this related to the need for containing bivariate functions of a pair of random variables .",
    "the fundamental underlying thread is the notion of common part @xcite .",
    "what are the common parts of a triple of random variables ? clearly , one can simply extend the notion of common part defined for a pair of random variables .",
    "this yields four common parts - one part that is simultaneously to common to all three random variables and one common part each , corresponding to each pair in the triple . indeed , if @xmath412 , then @xmath413 is the part simultaneously to common to @xmath414 and @xmath415 are the pairwise common parts .",
    "a simple extension of marton s coding suggests a way to handle these common parts .",
    "this does not yet answer the need for containment under bivariate function .",
    "we envision a fundamentally richer notion of common part for a triple of random variables .",
    "indeed , three nontrivial binary random variables @xmath416 have no common parts as defined earlier , since each pair has no common part and the triple does not admit a simultaneous common part . yet , the degeneracy in the joint probability matrix hints at a common part . indeed , they possess a _ conferencing _",
    "common part .",
    "for example , the pair @xmath417 have a common part .",
    "in other words , there exists a _ bivariate",
    "_ function of @xmath418 and a univariate function of @xmath419 that agree with probability @xmath169 .",
    "containment of this bivariate function brings in the need for structured codes .",
    "indeed , the resemblance to the problem studied by krner and marton @xcite is striking .",
    "we therefore believe the need for structured codes for three ( multi ) user communication problems is closely linked to the notion of common parts of a triple ( collection ) of random variables .",
    "analogous to conditional coding that contained univariate functions , endowing codebooks with structure is an inherent need to carefully handle additional degrees of freedom prevalent in larger dimensions .",
    "in this section , we prove strict sub - optimality of marton s coding technique for the 3-dbc presented in example [ ex:3-bcexample ] .",
    "in particular , we prove that if parameters @xmath218 are such that @xmath216 and @xmath420 , then @xmath421 .",
    "why is marton s coding technique suboptimal for the case described above . as mentioned in section [ subsec : thethreeuserbroadcastchannel ] , in this case , receiver @xmath169 is unable to decode the pair of codewords transmitted to users @xmath8 and @xmath167 .",
    "furthermore , based on unstructured independent coding , it does not attempt to decode a function of transmitted codewords - in this case the modulo@xmath2 sum .",
    "this forces decoder @xmath169 to be content by decoding only individual components of user @xmath8 and @xmath167 s transmissions , leaving residual uncertainty in the interference .",
    "the encoder helps out by precoding for this residual uncertainty .",
    "however , as a consequence of the cost constraint on @xmath185 , it is forced to live with a rate loss .",
    "since our proof traces through the above arguments in three stages , it is instructive . in the first stage",
    ", we characterize all test channels @xmath422 for which @xmath423 .",
    "this stage enables us identify ` active ' codebooks , their corresponding rates and characterize two upper bounds on @xmath424 .",
    "one of these contains the rate loss due to precoding . in the second stage ,",
    "we therefore characterize the condition under which there is no rate loss .",
    "as expected , it turns out that there is no rate loss only if decoder @xmath169 has decoded codewords of users @xmath8 and @xmath167 .",
    "this gets us to the third stage , where we conclude that @xmath216 precludes this possibility .",
    "the first stage is presented in lemma [ lem : characterizationoftestchannelthatcontainstheratetriple ] , second stage is stated in lemma [ lem : characterizationofconditionthatensuresnorateloss ] and proved in appendices [ appsec : characterizationfornoratelossinptp - stx ] , [ appsec : thebinaryadditivedirtypointtopointchannelsuffersarateloss ] .",
