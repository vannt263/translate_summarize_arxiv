    "_ superpositional sensors _ are an important class of pre - detection sensor models which arise in a wide range of joint detection and estimation problems .",
    "for example , in problems such as direction - of - arrival estimation for linear antenna arrays @xcite , multi - user detection for wireless communication networks @xcite , acoustic amplitude sensors @xcite , radio frequency ( rf ) tomography @xcite , target tracking with unresolved or merged measurements @xcite , multi - target track - before - detect with closely spaced targets @xcite , the sensor output is a function of the sum of contributions from individual sources . in classical estimation theory , a frequency domain model for the superpositional sensor",
    "is generally used to design algorithms for source separation and parameter estimation .",
    "conversely in dynamic state estimation , a detection based model is typically employed to transform the collected data into a set of point measurements , in order to facilitate the development of computationally efficient estimation algorithms .",
    "this is specifically the case in multi - target tracking @xcite , which is an important problem in estimation theory involving the joint estimation of an unknown and time varying number of targets and their trajectories .    many real life applications in radar , sonar @xcite , computer vision @xcite , robotics @xcite , automotive safety @xcite , cell biology @xcite , etc .",
    ", can be described as multi - target tracking problems .",
    "most of the multi - target tracking algorithms existing in the literature are designed for data that have been preprocessed into point measurements or detections @xcite .",
    "these algorithms are based on the `` detection sensor '' model which assumes that each target generates at most one detection , and that each measurement belongs to at most one target @xcite .",
    "the performed preprocessing of raw measurements into a finite sets of points is efficient in terms of memory and computational requirements , and is usually effective for a wide range of applications .",
    "however , the compression might lead to significant information loss in the presence of low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and/or closely spaced targets .",
    "the standard `` detection sensor '' approach may not be adequate in this case , and making use of all information contained in the pre - detection measurements becomes necessary . in turn , this requires more advanced sensor models and new algorithms .    in a superpositional sensor model ,",
    "the measurement at each time step is a superposition of measurements generated by each of the targets present @xcite . in @xcite mahler",
    "derived a superpositional cardinalized probability hypthesis density ( cphd ) filter as a tractable approximation to the bayes multi - target filter for superpositional sensor .",
    "the approach was implemented in @xcite using smc methods , and successfully applied to a passive acoustics application as well as rf tomography .",
    "the technique was also extended to multi - bernoulli and a combination of multi - bernouli and cphd @xcite .",
    "these filters , however , are not multi - target trackers because they rest on the premise that targets are indistinguishable .",
    "moreover , they require at least two levels of approximations : analytic approximations of the bayes multi - target filter and particles approximation of the obtained recursion .    inspired by @xcite , this paper proposes a multi - target tracker for superpositional sensors which estimates target tracks and requires only one level of approximation .",
    "our formulation is based on the same random finite set ( rfs ) framework that the superpositional cphd filters @xcite were derived from .",
    "however , we used a special class of rfs models , called labelled rfs @xcite , which enables the estimation of target tracks as well as direct particle approximation of the ( labeled ) bayes multi - target filter . to mitigate the depletion problem arising from sampling in high dimensional space",
    "we propose an efficient multi - target sampling strategy using the superpositional cphd filter @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will show how the recently introduced labeled multi - bernoulli @xcite and vo - vo @xcite densities can be constructed from the superpositional approximate cphd ( sa - cphd ) filter .",
    "these densities are then used to design effective proposal distributions for the rfs multi - target particle filter . while both the cphd and labeled rfs solutions",
    "require particle approximation , the latter has the advantage that it does not require particle clustering for the multi - target state estimation .",
    "the applicability of the proposed approach is verified through simulation analyses in a challenging closely - spaced multi - target scenario using radar power measurements with low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec : background ] we recall some definitions for labeled rfss and superpositional sensors . in section",
    "[ sec : multitarget_tracker ] we discuss the multi - target particle filter , the labeled multi - target transition density , and the superpositional approximate cphd .",
    "two multi - target particle trackers using the labeled multi - bernoulli ( lmb ) and the vo - vo densities for the proposal distribution are presented in section [ sec : proposals ] .",
    "numerical results for a radar application are presented in section [ sec : simulations ] , while conclusions and future research directions are discussed in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "this section briefly presents background material on superpositional sensor model and the rfs framework which we adopt for the formulation of a multi - target tracking filter .",
    "subsection [ sub : multi - target - estimation ] provides a summary of basic concepts in rfs .",
    "we present a concise description of the superpositional sensor model in subsection [ sub : superpositional - sensor ] and report a summary of key ideas on labled rfs needed for the derivation in subsection [ sub : labeled - rfs ] .",
    "suppose that at time @xmath0 , there are @xmath1 target states @xmath2 , each taking values in a state space @xmath3 . in the random finite set ( rfs )",
    "framework , the _ multi - target state _ at time @xmath0 is represented by the finite set @xmath4 , and the multi - target state space is the space of all finite subsets of @xmath3 , denoted as @xmath5 .",
    "an rfs is simply a random variable that take values the space @xmath5 that does not inherit the usual euclidean notion of integration and density .",
    "mahler s finite set statistics ( fisst ) provides powerful yet practical mathematical tools for dealing with rfss @xcite based on a notion of integration / density that is consistent with point process theory @xcite .",
    "similar to the standard state space model , the multi - target system model can be specified , for each time step @xmath0 , via the _ multi - target transition density _ @xmath6 and the _ multi - target likelihood _ _ function _ @xmath7 , using the fisst notion of integration / density .",
    "the _ multi - target posterior density _ ( or simply multi - target posterior ) contains all information about the multi - target states given the measurement history .",
    "the multi - target posterior recursion is direct generalisation of the standard posterior recursion @xcite , i.e. @xmath8 for @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the measurement history with @xmath12 denoting the measurement vector at time @xmath0 .",
    "target trajectories or tracks can be accommodated in the rfs formulation by incorporating a label in the target s state vector @xcite .",
    "the multi - target posterior ( [ eq : mtposterior ] ) then contains all information on the random finite set of tracks , given the measurement history . in @xcite , the set of tracks",
    "are estimated by simulating from the multi - target posterior ( [ eq : mtposterior ] ) using particle markov chain monte carlo ( pmcmc ) techniques @xcite .",
    "computing the multi - target posterior is prohibitively expensive for on - line applications .",
    "a more tractable alternative is the marginal @xmath13 at time @xmath0 known as the _ multi - target filtering density_. for notational compactness we omit the dependence on the measurement history . marginalizing the multi - target posterior recursion ( [ eq : mtposterior ] ) yields the _ multi - target bayes filter _",

    "note that the majority of work in multi - target tracking is based on filtering , and often the term multi - target posterior is used in place of multi - target filtering density .      in a superpositional sensor model ,",
    "the measurement @xmath18 is a non - linear function of the sum of the contributions of individual targets and noise , i.e. @xmath19 where @xmath20 represents the contribution of the single - target state @xmath21 to the sensor measurement ( @xmath22 is a non - linear mapping in general ) , @xmath23 is the measurement noise , and @xmath24 is a nonlinear mapping .",
    "for example ,  a superpositional sensor model commonly used in radar is @xmath25 where @xmath26  is the point - spread function of target @xmath21 , @xmath27  is the ( known ) amplitude , @xmath28 is the phase noise , uniformly distributed on @xmath29 $ ] , and @xmath30 is circularly complex symmetric gaussian noise .",
    "it is clear that this model takes on the form ( [ eq : spsensor ] ) by defining  @xmath31 . in general , the multi - target likelihood function for the superpositional sensor model is the probability density of the measurement @xmath18 given @xmath32 the sum of the contributions of individual targets , i.e. @xmath33    the sa - cphd filter filter presented in @xcite is an approximation to the multi - target bayes filter for a superpositional measurement model of the form @xmath34 where  @xmath23 is distributed according to @xmath35 , a zero mean gaussian with covariance @xmath36 .",

    "particle implementations of phd / cphd filter in general require clustering to extract multi - target estimates , which can introduce additional errors under challenging scenarios .      to perform tracking in the rfs framework we use the labeled rfs model which incorporates a unique label in the target s state vector to identify its trajectory @xcite . in this model ,",

    "particle filtering techniques permit recursive propagation of the set of weighted particles that approximate the posterior .",
    "central in monte carlo methods is the notion of approximating the integrals of interest using random samples .",

    "notice that we used the following definitions for grouping of labels in each particle @xmath177    where for each particle @xmath178 , @xmath179 is the set of survived labels , @xmath180 is the set of death labels , @xmath181 is the set of labels for newly born targets , and @xmath182 is the set of labels that did not generate a new targets .",
    "* multi - target particle filter + with lmb proposal distribution *    ' '' ''    * * * * * *   * * *   * * * * *   * * *   * *   * *   * *   * *   *     [ [ section-2 ] ]    the lmb proposal distribution leads to an efficient sampling strategy for the multi - target particle filter .",
    "however , the lmb proposal does not exploit all the information from the sa - cphd filter since the cardinality distribution of the lmb proposal does not match the cardinality distribution @xmath137 from the cphd prediction / update .",
    "matching of the cardinality distribution @xmath137 is important if we are interested in designing a proposal distribution that is efficient in low snr scenarios .",
    "generally , for low snr the multi - bernoulli cardinality distribution is not sufficiently informative , so that being able to estimate a more general cardinality distribution becomes fundamental .",
    "this reasoning is true also in classical multi - target tracking with detection measurements , e.g. the cphd filter outperforms the multi - bernoulli filter in low snr @xcite .",
    "hence , we seek a proposal distribution that matches the cphd cardinality exactly while exploiting the weights of individual labeled target clusters as computed from the approximate posterior phd . a single component vo - vo density can be used for this purpose , @xmath183^{\\mathbf{x}_{k}}\\label{eq : glmbproposal}\\ ] ]    we now specify the component weight @xmath184 and the multi - object exponential @xmath185^{\\mathbf{x}_{k}}$ ] , needed to match the cphd updated cardinality distribution and to account for the weights of individual target clusters .",
    "clearly , the single - target densities @xmath186 are obtained straightforwardly from gaussian clusters , i.e. @xmath187    the weight @xmath184 is then chosen to preserve the cphd cardinality distribution , and for a given cardinality , to sample labels proportionally to the product of the posterior phd masses of any possible label combinations .",
    "specifically , from the posterior phd mass of each cluster @xmath188 we construct approximate `` existence '' probabilities as @xmath189 the cardinality of the set of labels @xmath78 , including birth and survival labels , grows exponentially in time",
    ". moreover , in any practical implementation the use of a finite sample approximation coupled with resampling strategies typically leads to a much smaller unique labels set at each time @xmath0 .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ eq : phddist ] )",
    "is implemented by considering only labels from resampled particles at time @xmath84 , @xmath190 the weight @xmath184 is then defined as @xmath191 where @xmath192 denotes the set of `` existence '' probabilities for all current tracks and @xmath193 is the elementary symmetric function of order @xmath194 .",
    "the construction of the proposal in ( [ eq : glmbproposal ] ) leads a simple and efficient strategy for sampling . specifically , to sample from ( [ eq : glmbproposal ] ) we ,    * sample the cardinality @xmath195 of the newly proposed particle according to the distribution @xmath137 , * sample @xmath195 labels @xmath196 from @xmath197 using the distribution defined by @xmath198 , * for each @xmath199 we sample the kinematic part @xmath200 from @xmath201 .",

    "efficient approximation techniques exist for mitigating the computational load due to the sum kernel problem in ( [ eq : sum_kernel ] ) , see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a simple approximate solution can be obtained by using a single particle @xmath204 to evaluate the transition kernel @xmath205 however , in order to use the approximation in ( [ eq:1_kernel ] ) we have to choose the index @xmath206 of the previous particle in a way that guarantees @xmath207 .",
    "this implies that the particle @xmath204 has to verify the condition @xmath208 , i.e. the labels set of the particle @xmath204 includes the labels set of surviving targets in the sampled particle @xmath209 .",
    "in this section we demonstrate the rfs multi - target tracker with vo - vo proposal via a radar tracking application for closely spaced targets and low signal - to - noise ratio .",

    "we now describe a multi - target observation model for multi - target tracking using radar measurements .",

    "* @xmath232 is the complex echo of target @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath233 with @xmath234 a known amplitude , @xmath235 an unknown phase , and @xmath236 a zero - mean complex gaussian variable with variance @xmath237 .    for a non - fluctuating target amplitude ( swerling 0 )",
    ", @xmath232 is modeled as : @xmath238    let @xmath239 denote the deterministic part of the signal in cell @xmath75 : @xmath240 the power measurement in cell @xmath178 can be written as :    where @xmath241 and @xmath242 are statistically independent normal random variables .",
    "then @xmath243 has a ricean distribution , and reduces to a rayleigh distribution when @xmath244 .",
    "let @xmath245 be the signal - to - noise ratio defined in db as @xmath246 we can choose @xmath247 so that @xmath248 . in turn",
    ", since @xmath249 , the measurement in each cell @xmath250 is described by a non - central chi - squared distribution with @xmath251 degrees of freedom and non - centrality parameter @xmath252 , and simplifies to an exponential distribution in the case @xmath244 .",
    "then , the likelihood ratio for cell @xmath178 is given by : @xmath253 where @xmath254 is the modified bessel function .",
    "hence , the likelihood function for the vector measurement @xmath18 takes the form @xmath255 where @xmath256 is the union of all single - target templates , i.e. the set of measurement bins used for the measurement update .",
    "we consider a scenario with @xmath257 incoming targets as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : scene ] . to better highlight the spacing of targets , we report in fig .",
    "[ fig : scene ] the range - azimuth grid .",

    ", we describe prior knowledge using a gaussian distribution @xmath261 which mainly proposes incoming particles ( i.e. , most of particle velocity vectors are directed towards the radar position ) .",
    "specifically , for the birth intensity we use the gaussian @xmath261 and generate @xmath262 new born single - target particles in the cphd filter at every time step .     closely spaced targets moving towards the origin . ]",
    "results in terms of the estimated number of targets and optimal sub - pattern assignment ( ospa ) distance @xcite are reported in figs .",
    "[ fig : nt_10db]-[fig : ospa_10db ] for the case with @xmath260 and in figs .",

    "[ fig : ospa_7db ] a slower filter convergence and increasing ospa distance also for @xmath265 and @xmath266 , i.e. the instants at which targets disappear .",
    "this is due to the fact that for lower @xmath245 the tracker prefers to retain a `` false '' track for few steps rather then declaring a `` dead '' target too soon , as confirmed by the time behaviour of the average estimated number of targets in fig .",
    "[ fig : nt_7db ] .",
    "tuning of the _ survival probability _ @xmath267 can reduce this phenomenon . in practice , a perfect tuning of @xmath267 and of the _ birth probability _ @xmath268 require additional prior knowledge on the surveillance area .",
    "overall , the results confirm the applicability of the proposed approach for challenging multi - target problems with closely spaced targets and low @xmath245 .",
    "in this paper we discussed a general solution for multi - target tracking with _",
    "superpositional measurements_. the proposed approach aims at evaluating the multi - target bayes filter using smc methods .",
    "the critical enabling step was the definition of an efficient proposal distribution based on the approximate cphd filter for _ superpositional measurements_. numerical results confirmed the applicability to challenging multi - target tracking problems for closely spaced targets using radar measurements with low snr .",
    "a large - scale application of this approach might not be possible due to worsening depletion problems in high dimensional state spaces .",
    "however , mcmc methods could be used to devise a particle implementation that can scale with an increasing number of targets .",
    "furthermore , subdividing the targets into statistically non - interacting clusters and then processing the clusters separately could lead to satisfactory performance with reduced computational load .",
    "finally , the capability of separating closely spaced targets for superpositional measurements , i.e. estimating the correct cardinality when there are unresolved targets , means the approach could also be used as an initialization block of cheaper trackers like the lmb @xcite and vo - vo @xcite filters .",
    "specifically , parts of the radar superpositional measurement could be processed with the proposed approach to find the correct number of targets as well as there location , then thresholded measurements could be processed with the lmb / vo - vo tracker .",
    "this should lead to improved performance as the lmb / vo - vo tracker would be using a more informative prior distribution .",
