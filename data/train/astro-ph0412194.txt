    "accretion disks are very common in astrophysics .",
    "disks are found in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , around newly forming stars ( proto - planetary disks ) , and surrounding compact stellar remnants ( white dwarfs , neutron stars , black holes ) in binary systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "despite the overwhelming evidence for the existence of accretion disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and decades of literature dedicated to their understanding ( e.g. , see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , the detailed working mechanism of accretion disks remains enigmatic at best .",
    "one of the early puzzles in understanding the accretion phenomenon was the clear inadequacy of molecular viscosity in driving accretion in a keplerian disk .",
    "this led to the speculation of turbulence as a proxy for viscous transfer of angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the idea was particularly attractive because of the low viscosity of astrophysical fluids ( high reynolds number @xmath3 ) , which , according to conventional wisdom , should make the shear flow in accretion disks unstable to turbulence .",
    "however , in the context of keplerian disks relevant to most astrophysical applications , no instability could be identified .",
    "the linear instabilities that seemingly induce the onset of turbulence in normal shear flows are stabilized by the coriolis force associated with rotation in a keplerian disk .",
    "nonlinear hydrodynamic simulations appeared to confirm the absence of turbulence in such disks ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* both hereafter referred to as bhsw ) .",
    "the breakthrough came in 1991 , through re - discovery of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; * ? ? ? * ) by balbus and hawley @xcite , who showed through magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations that initial seed magnetic fields in an mhd disk grow exponentially within a few rotation times , causing the onset of mhd turbulence .",
    "the mri instability is now widely accepted as the driver of mhd turbulence in ionized disks ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .    despite the great success of the mri in many astrophysical systems",
    ", it is known that this instability will not operate in disks with very small ionization fractions , where the magnetic flux is poorly coupled to the gas .",
    "examples of systems with low ionization fractions are proto - planetary disks , outer regions of agn disks , and white dwarf disks in the low state @xcite .",
    "the route to turbulence and accretion in such neutral disks remains an outstanding puzzle in theoretical astrophysics .",
    "on the other hand , laboratory experiments of taylor - couette systems ( fluid flow between concentric rotating cylinders ) seem to indicate that , although coriolis force delays the onset of turbulence , the flow is ultimately unstable to turbulence for reynolds numbers larger than a few thousand ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even for subcritical systems ( systems with no linear instability ) .",
    "@xcite reviews the experimental evidence for the existence of turbulence in subcritical laboratory systems , and based on phenomenological analogy , concludes that a similar process must happen in astrophysical accretion flows .",
    "@xcite also claims that the absence of turbulence in previous numerical simulations ( bhsw ) is due to their small effective reynolds number , which is limited by the numerical viscosity caused by the finite resolution of the simulation .",
    "indeed , @xcite see turbulence persisting in numerical simulations of subcritical rotating flows for large enough reynolds numbers .",
    "how does a shearing flow that is linearly stable to perturbations switch to a turbulent state ?",
    "a possible explanation , known as _",
    "bypass _ transition , has been discussed in the fluid mechanics community for some time ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein , for an overview ) , though its diffusion into the astrophysical community has been slow @xcite .",
    "the bypass concept is based on the fact that _ definite frequency _ linear modes are not orthogonal in a shear flow .",
    "therefore , even if all of the linear modes are decaying , a suitably tuned linear combination of them can still show an arbitrarily large transient energy growth in the absence of viscosity . in lieu of linear instabilities such as mri ,",
    "the transient energy growth , supplemented by a non - linear feedback process to repopulate the growing disturbances , could plausibly sustain turbulence for large enough reynolds numbers .",
    "this paper , along with a companion paper ( * ? ? ? * hereafter man04 ) , investigates the transient growth of perturbations in rotating shear flows , with an emphasis on applications to astrophysical accretion disks .",
    "both papers study the dependence of the transient energy growth on various parameters of the system , in particular the wave vector of the perturbations and the reynolds number .",
    "while man04 focuses on an eigenmode analysis in eulerian coordinates for a shearing flow restricted between rigid walls , the present paper studies the bypass process in lagrangian coordinates for an infinite shearing flow .",
    "the advantage of the lagrangian approach is that there is no explicit coordinate dependence in the equations , and therefore the solution can be decomposed into plane waves .",
    "the drawback , however , is the explicit time dependence of the equations which prohibits definite frequency solutions , and thus requires explicit integration in time for each mode .",
    "the two analyses presented here and in man04 involve different numerical / analytic techniques and are both , in our opinion , valuable .",
    "the consistency of the results validates the general picture of our understanding of transient growth in the linear regime .",
    "in  2 we summarize the current understanding of the transient growth phenomenon in shearing flows .",
    "[ eqs ] introduces the basic linear equations in lagrangian coordinates in their most general form .",
    "[ ideal ] constitutes the main body of the paper , where we approach the problem of transient growth in inviscid and incompressible flows for general plane wave solutions .",
    "this is followed by [ visc ] and [ cs ] , where we study the effects of viscosity and compressibility / vertical structure , respectively , and make the connection to astrophysical accretion flows . finally ,",
    "in [ discuss ] we discuss conditions for the emergence of turbulence , and its realization in numerical simulations .",
    "[ conclude ] summarizes our results and concludes the paper .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , the systematic approach to transient growth in subcritical systems is through a linear combination of non - normal decaying modes . in particular , in a local region of an accretion flow , different definite frequency modes with equal vertical and azimuthal wave numbers , but different radial profiles , are generically not orthogonal to one another , i.e. d^3*x *  * * ^a^b 0,where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are velocity profiles of different modes . therefore ,",
    "even though all the modes may decay with time , a solution may still show a temporary energy growth for suitable initial conditions because of the cross terms in the energy expression . for a detailed description of the eigenmode approach ,",
    "we refer the reader to man04 and @xcite , which explain the numerical methods used to find the maximum growth through optimizing a linear combination of eigenmodes .",
    "an alternative approach , which allows simple analytic treatment of linear perturbations for the case of astrophysical accretion flows , is the so - called _ shearing box _ approximation in which we study the linear evolution of plane wave perturbations in lagrangian coordinates within a small region of an accretion flow @xcite .",
    "this is the approach we follow in this paper .",
    "[ vfield ] shows our choice of local cartesian coordinates : @xmath6 is along the radial direction , @xmath7 is along the azimuthal or streamwise direction , and @xmath8 is along the vertical direction .",
    "the unperturbed flow has a velocity in the @xmath7-direction and a velocity gradient ( shear ) along the @xmath6 direction .",
    "the coriolis force associated with rotation is described by an angular frequency vector @xmath9 pointed in the @xmath8 direction .",
    "we define q -d / dr , which is a dimensionless parameter that quantifies the shear in the local comoving box .",
    "is twice the oort constant @xmath10 . ] for example , @xmath11 corresponds to a keplerian accretion disk and @xmath12 to a disk with constant specific angular momentum .    starting with a plane wave in lagrangian coordinates with radial wave number @xmath13 ( eq . [ pwave ] ) , we show in [ eqs ] that the eulerian radial wave number @xmath14 of the plane wave evolves as a function of time @xmath15 according to : k_x = + ( qt)k_y , while the azimuthal and vertical wave numbers @xmath16 and @xmath17 remain unchanged .",
    "thus , the plane wave is effectively frozen into the flow and is swung around by the shear . for simplicity , as in @xcite and @xcite , let us consider ` two - dimensional ' ( @xmath18 ) incompressible and inviscid perturbations . in this regime , in general , the two - dimensional vorticity @xmath19 remains constant , while the two - dimensional divergence vanishes due to incompressibility , i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the energy content of the plane wave scales as : ^2_x + ^2_y = = , which reaches a maximum when @xmath21 , or @xmath22 .",
    "if the initial wave vector @xmath23 is negative , then the maximum is reached at positive time , and the energy growth factor is given by : g_max ( /k_y)^2 = ( qt)^2  for  -/k_y 1 .",
    "[ gpg]as promised , the growth can become arbitrarily large for long enough time .",
    "as we show in [ cs ] , the maximum growth is limited only by viscosity and scales as @xmath24 , where @xmath0 is the reynolds number ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* man04 ) .",
    "note that , after reaching the maximum , the linear solution drops and decays to zero asymptotically .",
    "therefore , to have sustained turbulence , the perturbations must become non - linear before reaching the peak and must provide sufficient feedback to keep the perturbations going .",
    "@xcite describe a 2d numerical simulation of the local accretion flow in which they find sustained turbulent behavior in the absence of viscosity .",
    "moving away from the @xmath18 plane , it is seen that for @xmath25 ( the regime of interest for astrophysical disks ) , the maximum growth drops ( * ? ? ?",
    "* man04 ) .",
    "however , @xcite argue that for @xmath26 , although the maximum growth is smaller , vertical stratification may cause the solution to have a non - vanishing asymptotic value , which is a fraction of the maximum growth .",
    "it is not clear if this will significantly help the onset of turbulence .",
    "this concludes our summary of ( the rather thin ) astrophysical literature on transient growth and the bypass mechanism . in the following sections",
    ", we present a formal treatment of the lagrangian hydrodynamic equations in the shearing box approximation , and study the transient growth of general plane wave solutions .",
    "we limit the calculations to scales much smaller than the thickness of the disk , which , for a geometrically thin disk , is in turn much smaller than the distance to the central object .",
    "we thus ignore the boundaries . within a comoving local box , and in terms of lagrangian",

    "the heuristic argument for assuming incompressibility in the analysis so far is that , if the wavelength of the velocity perturbations is much shorter than the sound horizon for the time of interest , then the density perturbations ( i.e. sound waves ) reach equilibrium early on and thus the density is effectively uniform during the timescale of interest for velocity perturbations . for a geometrically thin disk around a gravitating mass ,",

    "this growth is only limited by viscosity , and eventually by the vertical thickness of the accretion disk , as we saw in [ visc ] and [ cs ] .",
    "so why do 3d simulations of local hydrodynamic accretion flows fail to see the onset of turbulence for a keplerian disk ( bhsw ) ? as we mentioned in [ intro ] , one possibility is the limited numerical resolution of the 3d hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite invokes the scale invariance symmetry of inviscid navier - stokes equations , to argue that the lack of any instability on large scales probed by simulations implies stability for smaller scales .",
    "although this argument may hold for positive eigenvalue instabilities such as mri , the amplitude of transient growth is directly affected by the dynamical range of the simulation ( i.e. the effective reynolds number ) .",
    "therefore , the resolution of a simulation may be a critical factor which decides if an energy growth large enough to sustain turbulence can , or can not be achieved",
    ".    a yet more important factor in simulating the bypass phenomenon may be the assumed initial conditions of the simulations .",
    "although the steady turbulent phase is expected to be independent of initial conditions , due to the restricted nature of modes with large transient growth , the time needed to reach the steady turbulent phase will significantly depend on the choice of initial conditions .",
    "for example , based on the results of [ gpws ] , we can show that , starting with an isotropic distribution of energy in ( 3d ) k - space , the total linear energy decays in the linear regime .    in order to see this ,",
    "let us consider the general case of a @xmath140-dimensional isotropic initial energy distribution within the phase space of modes , i.e. @xmath141 .",
    "here , @xmath142 corresponds to a 3d isotropic initial condition , @xmath143 is a 2d isotropic distribution with @xmath18 , and @xmath144 refers to initial conditions with @xmath145 . since",
    ", the lagrangian modes are orthogonal , the maximum energy growth is the sum of the maximum energy growth of the individual modes , i.e. |g_max = g_max(*k * ) f(k ) * d^dk * f(k ) * d^dk*. at time @xmath146 , the maximum growth is peaked at @xmath147 , and @xmath18 with @xmath148 .",
    "based on the analyses of [ gpws ] , we can also roughly estimate the width of the peak , i.e. @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "in particular , for isotropic 3d initial conditions , we find |g_max,3d ~(qt)^2 f ( ) ( qt)^-3 ( ) ^2 df ( ) ( ) ^2 d = ( qt)^-1 , implying that , despite the presence of a large transient growth @xmath151 , as a result of the shrinking phase - space volume ( which decays as @xmath152 ) the total energy in the perturbations decays as @xmath153 , which is completely consistent with the bhsw results .    in 2d , as it was recently pointed out by @xcite , the shrinking of the phase space volume exactly cancels the transient growth , which implies a constant energy and thus , lack of any significant growth in the linear regime : |g_max,2d ~(qt)^2 f ( ) ( qt)^-2 df ( ) d = 1 , which is also consistent with simulations of @xcite .    therefore , it is only with near one - dimensional initial conditions , i.e. @xmath154 , where we can obtain significant transient growth of @xmath155 until @xmath156 .    one may speculate that in a 3d simulation the total energy decays until / unless it is re - distributed into near radial leading modes through non - linear couplings .",
    "bhsw follow the evolution for only a few orbital times , which is probably not enough to reach the expected turbulent phase with near - radial structure .",
    "however , a direct way to test the viability of this scenario is to study a 3d simulation with near - radial initial conditions , and see if a self - sustained turbulent phase can be realized .",
    "a more subtle question to address is the minimum energy growth ( or reynolds number ) required for the onset of sustained turbulence . unlike linear evolution , the answer to this question requires solving non - linear equations , which can be usually done only through numerical methods . for example , @xcite see sustained turbulence throughout the duration of their inviscid 2d simulation , while their run with a @xmath157 decays in a few hundred rotation times .",
    "however , it can be formally shown that due to the steady decay of comoving vorticity in 2d , one can not sustain turbulence in a periodic box without external forcing . therefore 2d simulations will not be able to pinpoint @xmath158 , the critical reynolds number necessary for the onset of sustained turbulence .",
    "however , this does not necessarily pose a problem for real disks , as the modes that show the largest growth are inherently three - dimensional ( see the end of [ cs ] ) .",
    "assuming that there exists a non - linear feedback process to repopulate the growing disturbances , let us present a heuristic way for estimating @xmath158 .",
    "most theoretical studies of 2d turbulence are based on describing the turbulent flow as a gas of 2d interacting vortices ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * and refrences therein ) . while in isotropic turbulence",
    "the vortices are typically circular , as can be seen in simulations such as that of @xcite , in a shear flow , the vortices are stretched along the stream ( our @xmath7 direction ) . the aspect ratio of vortices in their simulation of a 2d keplerian flow is within the range @xmath159 . let us now _ conjecture _ that this number is intrinsic to keplerian 2d turbulence , and identify it with the minimum value for the ratio @xmath160 .",
    "note that the latter is @xmath161 at the time of maximum growth , which is limited by viscosity through eq .",
    "( [ tmax ] ) .",
    "the rationale of our argument is that if the energy growth for modes with @xmath162 is significantly hindered by viscosity , then vortices of the corresponding scale damp and thus turbulence does not develop at smaller scales .",
    "now , defining the effective reynolds number for a simulation box of size @xmath163 as @xmath164 and noting that the minimum value of @xmath16 available to the modes is @xmath165 for periodic boundary conditions , eq .",
    "( [ tmax ] ) for a 2d keplerian flow gives ~(k_y)^3",
    "~610 ^ 3 - 410 ^ 4 .    based on analogy with the onset of turbulence in subcritical couette flow ,",
    "man04 find a value for @xmath158 that is consistent with the high end of the above range .",
    "we thus conclude that the critical reynolds number required for sustaining turbulence in 3d numerical simulations of a local keplerian flow is ( at least ) @xmath166 , which is comparable with the effective dynamical range in bhsw simulations .",
    "therefore , we expect larger 3d simulations , with appropriately chosen initial conditions , and/or long enough run time to start seeing the possible emergence of keplerian turbulence .    here",
    ", we note that as the turbulent vortices are stretched in the streamwise direction , more resolution in the radial ( compared to the streamwise ) direction is needed to resolve the turbulent structure .",
    "therefore , the most efficient way to simulate the turbulent regime is to look at a simulation box that is elongated in the streamwise ( y ) direction by a factor of @xmath159 compared to the radial ( x ) direction , while similar number of ( asymmetric ) cells in x and y directions are used .",
    "this will insure that the largest ( i.e. least damped ) sheared vortices can fit in the simulation box , while the vortices are adequately resolved in both directions .",
    "we do not have a solid answer for the optimum vertical ( z ) size of the simulation box but note that , due to the decay of vorticity in 2d , the vertical structure is necessary to sustain the turbulence .",
    "in this paper , for the first time , we present a three - dimensional analytic study of the transient growth of energy for plane wave disturbances of a rotating shear flow , in the limit of large speed of sound and small viscosity , and consider its direct application to astrophysical accretion disks .",
    "we see that , although the growth is fastest for 2d disturbances , a large transient energy growth is a generic feature of non - axisymmetric disturbances with relatively large radial leading wave numbers ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "the maximum growth is quadratic in time for 2d disturbances , but becomes linear in time for relatively large vertical wave numbers ( @xmath168 ) , and long times .    after including the effects of viscosity and compressibility / finite disk thickness ,",
    "we show that the maximum energy growth scales as @xmath169 , where , @xmath170 , is the reynolds number . therefore , for neutral astrophysical accretion disks with @xmath171 , assuming that there exists a non - linear feedback process to repopulate the growing disturbances , the transient growth can act as an alternative to the more conventional mri instability in ionized disks , in starting and sustaining the turbulence necessary to explain the observed accretion efficiencies .    finally , we present a heuristic argument based on the aspect ratio of sheared turbulent vortices to show that the critical reynolds number for sustaining keplerian hydrodynamic turbulence in a periodic shearing box should be @xmath166 .",
