    "in this work , we are concerned with the boussinesq system @xmath3 the first formal derivation for this system has appeared in the work of bona - chen - saut , @xcite to describe the ( essentially two dimensional ) motion of small - amplitude long waves on the surface of an ideal fluid under the force of gravity . here , @xmath4 represents the vertical deviation of the free surface from its rest position , while @xmath5 is the horizontal velocity at time @xmath6 . in the case of zero surface tension @xmath7 ,",
    "the constants @xmath8 must satisfy in addition the consistency conditions @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in the case of non - zero surface tension however , one only requires @xmath11 . for this reason ( as well as from the pure mathematical interest in the analysis of )",
    ", one may as well consider for all values of the parameters .",
    "systems of the form have been the subject of intensive investigation over the last decade . in particular , the role of the parameters @xmath8 in the actual fluid models has been explored in great detail in the original paper @xcite and later in @xcite .",
    "it was argued that only models in the form , for which one has linear and nonlinear well - posedness are physically relevant .",
    "we refer the reader to these two papers for further discussion and some precise conditions , under which one has such well - posedness theorems .",
    "regarding explicit traveling wave solutions , chen , has considered various cases of interest in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in fact , she has written down numerous traveling wave solutions ( i.e. in the form @xmath12 , where in fact some of them are not necessarily homoclinic to zero at @xmath13 .",
    "in a subsequent paper , @xcite , chen has also found new and explicit multi - pulsed traveling wave solutions .    in @xcite ,",
    "chen - chen - nguyen consider another relevant case , namely the bbm system , which ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "they construct periodic traveling wave solutions for the bbm case , as well as in more general situations . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors explore the existence theory for the the bbm system as well as its relations to the single bbm equation .",
    "we wish to discuss another aspect of , which is its hamiltonian formulation .",
    "since it is derived from the euler equation by ignoring the effects of the dissipation , one generally expects such systems to exhibit a hamiltonian structure .",
    "_ this is however not generally the case , unless one imposes some further restrictions on the parameters_. indeed , if @xmath15 , one can easily check that @xmath16 furthermore , @xmath17 is positive definite only if @xmath18 . from this point of view",
    ", it looks natural to consider the case @xmath15 and @xmath19 . in order to focus our discussion , we shall concentrate then on this version @xmath20 we will refer to as the boussinesq ` abc ' system .",
    "it is a standard practice that stable coherent structures , such as traveling pulses etc .",
    "are produced as constrained minimizers of the corresponding ( positive definite ) hamiltonians , with respect to a fixed conserved quantity .",
    "in fact , this program has been mostly carried out , at least in the hamiltonian cases , in a series of papers by chen , nguyen and sun .",
    "more precisely , in @xcite , the authors have shown that traveling waves for exist in the regime , corresponding to a `` large '' surface tension @xmath21 @xmath15 , @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , they have also shown stability of such waves in the sense of a ` set stability ' of the set of minimizers . in the companion paper @xcite , the authors have considered the general case @xmath23 , @xmath19 , which in particular allows for small surface tension .",
    "the existence of a traveling wave was proved for every speed @xmath24.this is the so - called subsonic regime .",
    "finally , we point out to a recent work by chen , curtis , deconinck , lee and nguyen , @xcite in which the authors study numerically various aspects of spectral stability / instability of some solitary waves of , including the multipulsed solutions exhibited in @xcite . in the same paper",
    ", the authors also study ( numerically ) the transverse stability / instability of the same waves , viewed as solutions to the two dimensional problem .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study rigorously the spectral stability of some explicit traveling waves in the regime @xmath23 , @xmath18 .",
    "this would be achieved via the use of the instabilities indices counting formulas of kapitula , kevrekidis and sandstede , @xcite , @xcite and the subsequent refinement by kapitula , stefanov @xcite .      in this section ,",
    "we follow almost verbatim the description of some explicit solutions of interest of , given by chen , @xcite , see also the more detailed exposition of the same results in @xcite . more precisely , the solutions of interest are traveling waves , that is in the form @xmath25 a direct computation shows that if we require that the pair @xmath26 vanishes at @xmath13 , then it satisfies the system @xmath27 the typical ansatz that one starts with , in order to simplify the system to a single equation is @xmath28 .",
    "this has been worked out by chen , @xcite , @xcite . the following result is contained in the said papers .",
    "( chen , @xcite , @xcite ) [ mchen ] let the parameters @xmath29 in the system satisfy one of the following    1 .",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 2 .",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath34    then , there are the following ( pair of ) exact traveling wave solutions ( i.e. solutions of ) @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 and @xmath38 is a constant that satisfies    1 .",
    "@xmath39 in case @xmath40 2 .",
    "@xmath41 in case @xmath42 .",
    "before we state our results , we pause to discuss the various definitions of stability .",
    "first , one says that the solitary wave solution @xmath43 is orbitally stable , if for every @xmath44 , there exists @xmath45 , so that whenever @xmath46 , one has that the corresponding solutions @xmath47 @xmath48 note that we have not quite specified a space @xmath49 , since this usually depends on the particular problem at hand ( and mostly on the available conserved quantities ) , but suffices to say that @xmath49 is usually chosen to be a natural energy space for the problem .",
    "this notion of ( nonlinear ) stability has been of course successfully used to treat a great deal of important problems , due to the versatility of the classical benjamin and grillakis - shatah - strauss approaches .",
    "however , it looks like these methods are not readily applicable ( if at all ) to the boussinesq ` abc ' system .",
    "we encourage the interested reader to consult the discussion in @xcite , where a weaker , but related stability was established in the regime @xmath50 and additional smallness assumption on the wave is required as well .",
    "this is why , one needs to develop an alternative approach to this important problem , which is one of the main goals of this work .    in this paper , we will concentrate on spectral stability .",
    "there is also ( the closely related and almost equivalent ) notion of linear stability , which we also mention below . in order to introduce the object of our study , as well as to motivate its relevance ,",
    "let us perform a linearization of the nonlinear system .",
    "using the ansatz @xmath51 in and ignoring all quadratic terms in the form @xmath52 leads to the following linearized problem @xmath53 letting @xmath54 the linearized problem that we need to consider may be written in the form @xmath55 note that in the whole line context , @xmath56 is a self - adjoint operator , when considered with the natural domain @xmath57 . letting @xmath58 , we see that the problem is in the form @xmath59 .",
    "the study of linear problems in this form is at the basis of the deep theory of @xmath60 semigroups . informally ,",
    "if the cauchy problem @xmath59 has global solutions for all smooth and decaying data , we say that @xmath61 generates a @xmath60 semigroup @xmath62 via the exponential map @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , we say that we have _ linear stability _ for the linearized problem @xmath59 , whenever the growth rate of the semigroup is zero or equivalently @xmath64 for all @xmath45 and for all sufficiently smooth and decaying functions @xmath65 .",
    "finally , we say that the system is _ spectrally stable _ , if @xmath66 .",
    "it is well - known that if @xmath61 generates a @xmath60 semigroup , then linear stability implies spectral stability , but not vice versa . nevertheless , the two notions are very closely related and in many cases ( including the ones under consideration ) , they are indeed equivalent . for the purposes of a formal definition , we proceed",
    "as follows    [ defi:1 ] we say that the problem is unstable , if there is @xmath67 and @xmath68 , so that @xmath69 otherwise , the problem is stable .",
    "that is , stability is equivalent to the absence of solutions of with @xmath70 .",
    "we are now ready to state our results .",
    "we chose to split them in two cases , just as in theorem [ mchen ] .",
    "for the case @xmath71 , we have    [ theo:1 ] let @xmath71 .",
    "then , the traveling wave solutions of the ` abc ' system @xmath72 with speed @xmath73 are stable , for all @xmath74 equivalently , all waves in are stable , for all speeds @xmath75 .",
    "note that @xmath75 is equivalent to @xmath76 , so we assume this henceforth . in the remaining case , we assume only @xmath77 , but observe that in this case , theorem [ mchen ] requires that @xmath78 , that is the traveling waves become standing waves .",
    "[ theo:20 ] let @xmath77 .",
    "then , the standing wave solutions of the boussinesq system @xmath79 are spectrally stable @xmath80 in particular , the condition holds ( and thus the waves are spectrally stable ) , whenever @xmath81 on the other hand , the condition fails ( and thus the waves are spectrally unstable ) , if @xmath82    * remark : * note that while , we can not explicitly compute the value @xmath83 in , we obtain estimates , which imply some pretty good results for the stability / instability intervals .",
    "one can in fact push this further to narrow the gap between the stability and instability regions , predicted by .",
    "this can be done in principle with any degree of accuracy , but it increases the complexity the argument .",
    "in this section , we collect some preliminary results , which will be useful in the sequel .",
    "we shall need some spectral information about the operator @xmath56 .",
    "we collect the results in the following    [ prop:10 ] let @xmath19 and @xmath84 .",
    "then , the self - adjoint operator @xmath56 has the following spectral properties    * then the operator @xmath56 has an eigenvalue at zero , with an eigenvector @xmath85 .",
    "* there is @xmath86 , so that the essential spectrum is in @xmath87 .",
    "the first property is easy to establish , this is the usual eigenvalue at zero generated by translational invariance . for the proof ,",
    "all one needs to do is take a spatial derivative in the defining system , whence @xmath88 .",
    "regarding the essential spectrum , we reduce matters to the weyl s theorem ( using the vanishing of the waves at @xmath13 ) , which ensures that @xmath89\\ ] ] that is , it remains to check that the matrix differential operator @xmath90 . by fourier transforming @xmath91 , it will suffice to check that the matrix @xmath92 is positive definite for all @xmath93 .",
    "since @xmath94 , it will suffice to check that the determinant has a positive minimum over @xmath93 .",
    "we have @xmath95 where in the last inequality , we have used @xmath96 .",
    "the strict positivity follows by observing that @xmath97 , since @xmath98 .      in this section",
    ", we introduce the instability indices counting formulas , which in many cases of interest can in fact be used to determine accurately both stability and instability regimes for the waves under consideration .",
    "as we have mentioned above , this theory has been under development for some time , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , but we use a recent formulation due to kapitula - kevrekidis and sandstede ( kks ) , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , even the ( kks ) index count formula is not directly applicable , which is not satisfied for @xmath99 acting on @xmath100 to the problem of , which is why kapitula and stefanov , @xcite have found an approach , based on the kks of the theory , which covers this situation . in order to simplify the exposition , we will restrict to a corollary of the main result in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , a the stability problem in the form is considered in the form @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a self - adjoint linear differential operator with domain @xmath103 for some @xmath104 .",
    "it is assumed that for the operator @xmath102 ,    1 .",
    "there are @xmath105 negative eigenvalues the number of negative eigenvalues ( counting multiplicities ) of a self - adjoint operator @xmath106 ( counting multiplicity ) , so that each of the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath107 belong to @xmath108 .",

    "first , theorem [ t : index ] applies for scalar - valued operators @xmath102 , while we need to deal with vector - valued operators .",
    "this is a minor issue and in fact , one sees easily that the arguments in @xcite carry over easily in the case , where @xmath102 is a vector - valued self - adjoint operator as well .",
    "a second , more substantive issue is that the form of is not quite the one in .",
    "namely , we have that the operator @xmath128 , while still skew - symmetric is not equal to @xmath99 .    in order to fix",
    "that , we need to recast the eigenvalue problem in a slightly different form . indeed , letting @xmath129 and taking @xmath130 on both sides of ,",
    "we may rewrite it as follows @xmath131 if we now introduce @xmath132 we easily see that @xmath133 is still anti - symmetric , @xmath134 is self - adjoint and we have managed to represent the eigenvalue problem in the form @xmath135 . note that the operator @xmath133 is very similar to @xmath99 , except for the action of the invertible symmetric operator @xmath136 on it .",
    "it is not hard to see that the result of theorem [ t : index ] applies to it ( while it still fails the standard conditions of the kks theory , due to the non - invertibility of @xmath133 ) .",
    "note that one needs to replace @xmath137 by @xmath138 in the formula .",
    "furthermore , the number of unstable modes for the two systems ( @xmath139 and @xmath140 ) is clearly the same , due to the simple transformation @xmath141 connecting the corresponding eigenfunctions .",
