    "conventional shell - model ( sm ) calculations often assume an inert core with a few valence nucleons as active particles .",
    "the calculation of the two - body effective interaction for the valence nucleons can be conveniently divided into three steps : ( 1 ) calculate the brueckner reaction matrix g @xcite from a realistic nn potential ; ( 2 ) calculate the two - body q - box @xcite from the g - matrix ; and ( 3 ) calculate the folded diagrams @xcite from the q - box .",
    "the second step provides major difficulties , because one is unable to evaluate the core - polarization diagrams to all orders and there is no sign of convergence within the lowest few orders @xcite .",
    "this difficulty might be avoided by the use of a no - core model space @xcite , for which all the nucleons in a nucleus are treated as active .",
    "in such a model space , because there are no hole lines , all the core - polarization diagrams are absent and the two - body q - box reduces to the g - matrix .",
    "the folded diagrams can be calculated from the q - box by using iteration methods proposed by kuo and krenciglowa @xcite or by lee and suzuki @xcite . beyond these issues",
    "are the largely unexplored questions on the role of effective many - body forces in no - core model spaces .    in previous works @xcite , we calculated the low - lying energy spectra for a few light nuclei by employing no - core model spaces .",
    "we approximated the two - body effective interaction by the g - matrix and neglected the folded diagrams .",
    "because of this approximation , our calculations involved the starting energy as a parameter , which , in one study @xcite , was chosen to fit the nuclear binding energy .    in this work , we will calculate the g - matrix using an improved version of the nijmegen potential ( nijmii ) @xcite and we follow the lee and suzuki method @xcite to sum the two - body folded diagrams to all orders .",
    "the resulting starting - energy - independent two - body effective interaction is not hermitian but its non - hermiticity is found to be extremely small .",
    "we obtain the hermitian effective interaction @xmath1 to be used in sm calculation by taking the average of the non - hermitian effective interaction and its conjugate .",
    "it is pointed out in ref.@xcite that this is an excellent approximation .",
    "we will also discuss the choice of the two - nucleon hamiltonian @xmath2 employed in the g - matrix calculation , which determines the intermediate - energy spectrum in the ladder diagrams .",
    "currently , due to uncertainties in the optimal choices of one - body potentials and methods for treating the spurious center - of - mass motion , there is no generally accepted @xmath2 .",
    "it is obvious that the two - body effective interactions @xmath3 depend on @xmath2 , so that one wishes to employ the @xmath2 which best represents the physics of the two - nucleon subsystem in the nuclear medium .",
    "we will present a choice which is physically motivated yet retains simplicity for calculations .",
    "we will furthermore introduce an approximation scheme which allows us to obtain easily , an effective two - body interaction for a no - core model space directly from the starting - energy - dependent g - matrix without evaluating the folded diagrams .",
    "we will demonstrate that the resulting approximate form is an improvement over the procedure we introduced in ref.@xcite and more closely represents the exact theoretical @xmath3 .",
    "assuming that there are only two - body interactions among nucleons in a nucleus , the nuclear hamiltonian for an @xmath4-nucleon nucleus can be written as : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the one - body kinetic energy , @xmath7 is the center - of - mass ( cm ) kinetic energy of the nucleus , @xmath8 is the two - body nn potential .",
    "the expression for the brueckner reaction matrix g @xcite can be generally written in the following form : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the pauli projection operator and @xmath11 is the starting energy .",
    "the two - nucleon hamiltonian @xmath2 represents the dynamics of the two - particle subsystem in the nuclear medium generated by the remaining ( @xmath4 - 2 ) nucleons ( also referred to as spectators ) .",
    "it makes sense to optimize the description of this two - particle subsystem in order to minimize the effects of the many - body effective interactions which we plan to neglect . clearly",
    "the role of the medium on the single - particle states needs to be included and one is , therefore , led to introduce one - body potentials into @xmath2 yielding : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the single - particle ( sp ) hamiltonian with @xmath6 the one - body kinetic energy and @xmath14 the mean field generated by the spectators",
    ".    a physically motivated @xmath15 could be the hartree - fock ( hf ) self - consistent mean field or the phenomenological woods - saxon ( ws ) well with appropriate depth , width and surface thickness .",
    "however , to employ either the hf field or the ws well is a very computationally demanding project for a realistic force @xmath16 . for convenience , we assume that the mean field @xmath14 can be approximated by a _ shifted _ harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) potential ( see fig.1 ) , namely , @xmath17 the use of the ho potential in conjunction of the ho basis not only simplifies the g - matrix calculation @xcite but also facilitates the treatment of the spurious center - of - mass motion .",
    "note that , as far as the low - lying states are concerned , one need not be greatly concerned with the obvious fact that , when @xmath18 goes to infinity , @xmath15 vanishes while @xmath19 becomes infinite .",
    "actually , in the low - lying states , the nucleons in a nucleus remain primarily within the nuclear radius @xmath20 , so the shape of @xmath21 for large @xmath18 , say , @xmath22 , plays a less significant role in the bound - state spectrum .    with the approximation stated in eq.([appr ] ) , the two - nucleon hamiltonian ( [ h2v ] ) becomes @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the pure ho sp hamiltonian .",
    "the corresponding g - matrix ( [ gg ] ) becomes @xmath25 where @xmath26 . in writing the above equation ,",
    "we have added a constant ( @xmath27 ) to both the starting energy @xmath11 and the two - nucleon hamiltonian @xmath2 .",
    "obviously this does not change the result for the g - matrix which depends only on the difference between @xmath11 and @xmath2 .    for no - core",
    "model spaces , the starting - energy - independent two - body effective interaction @xmath1 is the ladder diagram series ( g - matrix ) plus the folded diagrams . if we approximate the g - matrix by @xmath28 as in eq.([go ] ) , @xmath1 is written as @xmath29 the folded diagrams can be evaluated by employing the iteration methods proposed in refs.@xcite",
    ". we will use the `` vertex - renormalization '' procedure of ref.@xcite . the input to this method consists of the @xmath30 and its derivatives with respective to @xmath31 , whose values are taken at an arbitrary ( in principle ) but fixed starting energy @xmath31 .",
    "we use a ho sp basis with @xmath32=18 mev and a no - core model space containing the first 4 major shells ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35-@xmath36 and @xmath37-@xmath38 ) . the @xmath10 operator in eq.([go ] )",
    "is defined to forbid the scattering of the two particles into an intermediate state inside the model space ( i.e. , @xmath10=0 ) .    for @xmath16",
    ", we adopt a new nijmegen local nn potential ( nijmii ) @xcite , which was fitted to the world nn scattering data with a nearly optimal @xmath39 per degree of freedom ( 1.03 per datum ) .",
    "other potentials ( reid93 and av18 ) obtained by fitting the same data have a comparable @xmath39 and yield similar deuteron and triton properties ( see ref.@xcite for more details ) .",
    "the derivatives of the g - matrix are calculated numerically through ninth order using 11 sets of @xmath30 with @xmath31 ranging from -75 mev to + 75 mev , in steps of 15 mev . in table 1 under column",
    "`` @xmath3 '' , we list a few diagonal two - body matrix elements ( tbmes ) of the resulting effective interaction . for comparison and further discussion below",
    ", we also present , in table 1 , g - matrix elements at selected values of @xmath31 , and at a state - dependent choice of @xmath31 .",
    ".selected diagonal tbmes for the starting - energy - independent two - body effective interaction @xmath3 .",
    "these matrix elements should be compared with the g - matrix elements listed in the table for three different starting energies .",
    "values in italics indicate values in good agreement with @xmath3 .",
    "note that @xmath40 mev , @xmath41 mev , @xmath42 mev .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table 2 , we show the results for the low - lying energy spectrum of @xmath0 .",
    "the calculations are performed in the same model space for which the g - matrices and the effective interaction are calculated .",
    "but we only allow up to @xmath43 excitations from the lowest - energy configuration [ @xmath44 . with the ho sp basis that we used ( @xmath32=18 mev ) , @xmath3 overbinds the ground state by about 1.66 mev , as shown in the column labelled `` exact '' .",
    "it should be pointed out that this result depends quite sensitively on the ho parameter @xmath32 .",
    "obviously , this is related to the approximation in eq.([appr ] ) , whose quality depends on @xmath32 .",
    "anyway , we find that when a ho basis with a smaller @xmath32 is used , the resulting two - body effective interaction tends to overbind @xmath0 by an even larger amount .",
    "we notice that this is also a feature of the results obtained by poppelier and brussaard in ref.@xcite ( see fig.7 in this reference ) , although in that work , the effective interaction has some residual dependence on the starting energy .",
    "the calculated excitation energies shown in table 2 for @xmath3 tend to be higher than the experimental results but the experimental level sequence is more or less reproduced . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the excitation energies are even higher .",
    "it is not clear to us why the effective interactions obtained through the lee - suzuki procedure from the g - matrices using an ho sp basis with @xmath32 smaller than 18 mev tend to overbind @xmath0 .",
    "it is quite likely that for light nuclei , the approximation made in eq.([appr ] ) of replacing the mean field generated by the spectators by a shifted ho potential with @xmath45mev requires significant corrections such as effective three - body forces .",
    "further investigations on this are necessary .    shown in table 2 under column",
    "`` approx . ''",
    "are the results of the sm calculation using the g - matrix ( instead of @xmath3 ) calculated at the starting energies given by eq.([wp ] ) with @xmath46mev .",
    "this g - matrix has been demonstrated in the previous section to be a good approximation to @xmath3 when the individual matrix elements are compared ( see table 1 and fig.1 ) .",
    "apparently it is also a good approximation to @xmath3 when tested by evaluating the energy spectrum .",
    "in contrast , the g - matrix evaluated at any constant starting energy @xmath31 is not a very good approximation to @xmath3 .",
    "one can see from table 2 that the calculated ground - state binding energy of @xmath0 using g - matrix at @xmath47 is about 14 mev smaller than the `` exact '' result ( -21.497 mev vs -35.655 mev ) .",
    "the calculated energy spectrum is also different .",
    "indeed this g - matrix has an rms deviation of about 1 mev in its tbmes from those of @xmath3 ( see fig.2 ) and should not be expected to approximate @xmath3 well .",
    "when the starting energy @xmath31 is restricted to be a constant , the g - matrix at @xmath48 best approximates @xmath3 when the rms deviation @xmath49 in the tbmes [ eq.([del ] ) ] is used as the criterion ( fig.2 ) .",
    "the sm results using @xmath50 are also listed in table 2 .",
    "the ground - state energy is clearly too low compared to the `` exact '' result .",
    "we have succeeded in evaluating a starting - energy - independent effective two - body interaction @xmath3 for a large no - core model space for the new nijmegen potential @xcite .",
    "our main conclusion is that @xmath3 can be well - approximated by the g - matrix elements evaluated at a starting energy which depends on the energy of the initial two - particle state in the ladder diagrams .",
    "we have seen from table 1 and fig.1 that for the effective - interaction tbme @xmath51 compares favorably with the corresponding tbme of @xmath30 where @xmath31 is given by @xmath52 for @xmath0 with @xmath32=18mev , we found that @xmath46mev is a good choice . notice that when @xmath31 is away from the poles of @xmath30 , a variation of a few mev in @xmath53 is not significant as the g - matrix element is a very slowly varying function of @xmath31 in this case .",
    "we emphasize that the choice of @xmath2 could be very important , as it determines the intermediate - energy spectrum in the two - nucleon multiple scattering processes ( ladder diagrams ) .",
    "different @xmath2 will lead to different @xmath3 . in this work",
    ", we have approximated the mean field generated by the spectator particles by a shifted ho potential , which seems to give a reasonable description for @xmath0 , when the ho characteristic parameter @xmath32=18 mev is used .",
