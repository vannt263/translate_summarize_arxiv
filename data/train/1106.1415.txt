    "because the dynamics of financial markets are of great importance in economics and econophysics @xcite , the dynamics of both stock price and trading volume have been studied for decades as a prerequisite to developing effective investment strategies .",

    ", they found that ( i ) the distribution of the scaled price interval @xmath8 can be approximated by a stretched exponential function , and ( ii ) the sequence of the price return intervals has a long term memory related to the original volatility sequence .",
    "the scaling and memory properties of financial records are similar to those found in climate and earthquake data @xcite .",
    "a feature of the recent history of the stock market has been large price movements associated with high volume . in the black monday stock market crash of 1987 ,",
    "the dow jones industrials average ( djia ) plummeted 508 points , losing 22.6 percent of its value in one day , which led to the pathological situation in which the bid price for a stock actually exceeded the ask price . in this financial crash",
    "approximately @xmath9 shares traded , a one - day trading volume three times that of the entire week previous .",
    "understanding the precise relationship between price and volume fluctuations has thus been a topic of great interest in recent research @xcite .",
    "trading volume data in itself contains much information about market dynamics , e.g. , the distribution of the daily traded volume displays power - law tails with an exponent within the lvy stable domain @xcite .",
    "recently , ren and zhou @xcite studied the intraday database of two composite indices and 20 individual indices in the chinese stock markets .",
    "they found that the intraday volume recurrence intervals show a power - law scaling , short - term correlations and long - term correlations in each stock index .    in this study",
    "we analyze u.s .",
    "stock market data over a range broad enough to allow us to identify how several financial factors significantly affect scaling properties .",
    "we study the daily trading volume volatility return intervals @xmath0 between two successive volume volatilities above a certain threshold @xmath1 , and find a range of power - law distributions broader than that found earlier in price volatility return intervals @xcite .",
    "we find a unique scaling of the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath2 for different thresholds @xmath1 .",
    "we also perform a detailed analysis of the relation between volume volatility return intervals and four financial stock factors : ( i ) stock lifetime , ( ii ) market capitalization , ( iii ) average trading volume , and ( iv ) average trading value .",
    "we find systematically different power - law exponents for @xmath2 when binning stocks according to these four financial factors .",
    "similar to that found for the chinese market @xcite , we find that in the u.s .",
    "stock market the conditional probability distribution , @xmath6 for @xmath0 following a certain interval @xmath7 , demonstrates that volume return intervals are short - term correlated .",
    "we also find that the daily volume volatility shows a stronger long - term correlation for sequences of longer lifetime but no clear changes in long - term correlations for different stock size factors such as capitalization , volume , and trading value .",
    "in order to obtain a sufficiently long time series , we analyze the daily trading volume volatility of 17,197 stocks listed in the u.s .",
    "stock market for at least 350 days .",
    "we obtain our data from the center for research in security prices ( crsp ) us stock database , which lists the daily prices of all listed nyse , amex , and nasdaq common stocks , along with basic market indices .",
    "the period we study extends from 1 january 1989 to 31 december 2008 , a total of 5042 trading days .",
    "for a stock trading volume time series , in a manner similar to stock price analysis @xcite , we define two basic measures : volume return @xmath10 and volume volatility @xmath11 .",
    "the volume return @xmath10 is defined as the logarithmic change in the successive daily trading volume for each stock , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the daily trading volume at time @xmath14 .",
    "we define volume volatility to be the absolute value of the volume return . in order to compare different stocks , we determine the volume volatility @xmath15 by dividing the absolute returns @xmath16 by their standard deviation , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the time average for each stock .",
    "the threshold @xmath1 is thus measured in units of standard deviation of absolute volume return @xmath16 .    for a volume volatility time series",
    ", we collect the time intervals @xmath0 between consecutive volatilities",
    "@xmath15 above a chosen threshold @xmath1 and construct a new time series of volume return intervals @xmath19 . fig .  [ fig1](a ) shows the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the pdf of the volume volatility return interval time series @xmath19 .",
    "obviously , @xmath2 decays more slowly for large @xmath1 than for small @xmath1 . for large @xmath1",
    ", @xmath2 has a higher probability of having large interval values because extreme events are rare in a high threshold series .",
    "we next determine whether there is there any scaling in the distribution by plotting the pdfs of the volume return intervals @xmath2 , scaled with the mean volume return interval @xmath20 , for different thresholds in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "we can see that all five threshold values @xmath1 curves ( full symbols ) callapse onto a single curve , suggesting the existence of a scaling relation , @xmath21 as the threshold @xmath1 increases , the curve ( rare events ) tends to be truncated due to the limited size of the dataset .",
    "the tails of the scaling function can be approximated by a power - law function as shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , @xmath22 where the tail exponent is @xmath23 .",
    "the exponent of the scaled pdfs for @xmath24 is @xmath25 by the least square method , which is the same as the unscaled pdf exponent @xmath25 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "the power - law exponents for intraday volume recurrence intervals of several chinese stock indices are from @xmath26 to @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "our exponents @xmath23 are larger than those in the chinese stock markets",
    ". this might be due to differing definitions of volume volatility . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the volume volatility is defined as intraday volume divided by the average volume at one specific minute of the trading day averaged over all trading days . here",
    "we define the volume volatility to be the logarithmic change in the successive daily volumes [ eqs .",
    "[ return.eq ] and  [ volatility.eq ] ] . for comparison , and using the same approach , fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) and fig .",

    "note that it is not easy to distinguish between a stretched exponential and a power - law when studying price volatilities @xcite , i.e. , the power - law range is small and a stretched exponential could also provide a good fit .",
    "in contrast , the pdfs of the volume volatility return intervals display a wide range of power - law tails , which differs from the stretched exponential tail apparent in the price return intervals @xcite . our results for volume volatility may suggest that @xmath2 for price volatility is also a power - law , but this could not be verified because the range of the observed power - law regime [ see figs .",
    "[ fig1](c ) and  [ fig1](d ) ] is more limited than the broad range of scales seen in the volume volatility [ figs .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and  [ fig1](b ) ] .",
    "the difference between the power - law and stretched exponential behavior of @xmath2 may be related to the existence or non - existence respectively of non - linearity represented in the multifractality of the time series . when non - linear correlations appear in a time record , bugachev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath2 is a power - law . on the other hand , when non - linear correlations do not exist and",
    "only linear correlation exists , bunde _",
    "_ @xcite found stretched exponential behavior .",
    "a comparison with the shuffled records allows us to see how the empirical records differ from randomized records .",
    "we shuffle the volume volatility time series to make a new uncorrelated sequence of volatility , and then collect the time intervals above a given threshold @xmath1 to obtain synthetic random control records .",
    "the curve that fits the shuffled records [ the open symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] is an exponential function , @xmath28 , and forms a possion distribution .",
    "a poisson distribution indicates no correlation in shuffled volatility data , but the empirical records suggest strong correlations in the volatility .",
    "we study the relation between the scaled pdfs @xmath29 as a function of @xmath8 for four financial factors : ( a ) stock lifetime , ( b ) market capitalization , ( c ) mean volume , and ( d ) mean trading value for threshold @xmath30 . for higher @xmath1 values , we do not have sufficient data for conclusive results @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot the scaled pdfs for these four factors .",
    "the volume return intervals characterize the distribution of large volume movements . a high probability of having a large volume return interval @xmath0 suggests a correlation in volume volatility ,",
    "because small volatilities are followed by small volatilities and the time interval between the two large volatilities becomes relatively longer than those of random records . in order to charaterize how these four factors affect the distribution of volume return intervals",
    ", we divide all stocks into four bins for each factor . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , the probability that @xmath0 will be large is greater in the bin with 15@xmath3120 year old stocks ( triangles ) than in the bins of younger stock .",
    "this indicates that small volatilities ( below the threshold ) tend to follow small volatilities and that the time intervals between large volatilities in the bin of 15@xmath3120 year - old stocks are larger than the time intervals in the bin of 5 years old stocks ( dots ) .",
    "this also suggests that the volume volatility time records of older stocks are more auto - correlated than those of younger stocks .",
    "the decaying parameters represented by the power - law exponents are quite different : @xmath32 for the shortest lifetime bin and @xmath33 for the longest lifetime bin",
    ". this significant difference might be caused by differences in autocorrelation in these series .    in figs .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ,  [ fig2](c ) , and  [ fig2](d ) , we show a similar tendencies for stock bins with different capitalizations , mean volumes , and mean trading values . trading value is defined as stock price multiplied by transaction volume . for each stock ,",
    "we designate the lifetime average of capitalization , volume , and trading value as performance indices .",
    "for example , the power - law exponents of the pdfs , @xmath29 , increase as the capitalization becomes larger [ see fig .  [ fig2](b ) ] . to clarify the picture",
    ", we divide all stocks into different subsets and study the behavior of the power - law exponent @xmath23 with regard to these four factors . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , stocks are sorted into 10 subsets , from 508 days ( 2 years ) to 5080 days ( 10 years ) .",
    "we fit the power - law tails of the volume return intervals for each subset and plot the exponent @xmath23 versus the lifetime of the stocks . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , we can observe a systematic trend with stock lifetime .",
    "it is seen that a smaller exponent @xmath23 which indicates a stronger correlation in older stock subsets .",
    "similarly , we sort the stocks by capitalization , mean volume , and mean trading value , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ,  [ fig3](c ) , and  [ fig3](d ) .",
    "it is seen that @xmath23 decreases with increasing of all these three factors but seem to become constant for large values of capitalizations , mean volumes and mean trading values .",
    "since all factors similarly affect the scaling of the pdf , @xmath29 , we now determine how much these factors are correlated .",
    "to study the relations between different stock bins , we plot the relation between trading value versus capitalization , mean volume versus capitalization , and mean trading value versus mean volume for all the stocks shown in fig .",
    "we see that larger capitalization stocks tend to have a larger trading volume and a larger trading value , which is consistent with figs .  [ fig1](b ) ,  [ fig1](c ) , and  [ fig1](d ) .",
    "the correlation coefficients between trading value and capitalization , mean volume and capitalization , and trading value and volume are 0.62 , and 0.55 , and 0.78 , respectively .",
    "the correlation coefficients are high because these capitalization , volume , and trading value factors are all affected by firm size .",
    "our analyses do not , however , show a significant relationship between stock lifetime and its trading value , capitalization , and mean volume , and the correlation coefficients are all @xmath34 .",
    "we characterize a sequence of volume return intervals in terms of the autocorrelations in the time series .",
    "if the volume return intervals series are uncorrelated and independent of each other , their sequences can be determined only by the probability distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "if the series is auto - correlated , the preceding value will have a memory effect on the values following in the sequence of volume volatility return intervals .    in order to investigate whether short - term memory is present , we study the conditional pdf , @xmath6 , which is the probability of finding a volume return interval @xmath0 immediately after an interval of size @xmath7 . in records without memory ,",
    "@xmath6 should be identical to @xmath2 and independent of @xmath7 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath6 should depend on @xmath7 . because the statistics for @xmath7 of a single stock are of poor quality",
    ", we study @xmath6 for a range of @xmath35 .",
    "the entire dataset is partitioned into eight equal - sized subsets , @xmath36 , with intervals of increasing size @xmath37 .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the pdfs @xmath6 for @xmath38 , i.e. , small interval size @xmath39 and @xmath40 large interval size @xmath41 for different @xmath1 .",
    "the probability of finding large @xmath8 is larger in @xmath40 ( open symbols ) than in @xmath38 ( full symbols ) , while the probability of finding small @xmath8 is larger in @xmath38 than that in @xmath40 .",
    "thus large @xmath7 tends to be followed by large @xmath0 , and vice versa , which indicates short - term memory in the volume return intervals sequence .",
    "moreover , note that @xmath6 in the same subset for different thresholds @xmath1 fall onto a single curve , which indicates the existence of a unique scaling for the conditional pdfs as well .",
    "similar results were found for the volume volatility of the chinese markets @xcite and for price volatilities @xcite .",
    "in previous studies , the price volatility series was shown to have long - term correlations . using a similar approach",
    ", we test whether the volume volatility sequence also possesses long - term correlations . to answer this question",
    ", we employ the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) method @xcite to further reveal memory effects in the volume volatility series . using the dfa method ,",
    "we divide an integrated time series into boxes of equal length @xmath42 and fit a least squares line in each box .",

    "the correlation exponent @xmath44 characterizes the autocorrelation in the sequence .",
    "the time series has a long - term memory and a positive correlation if the exponent factor @xmath47 , indicating that large values tend to follow large values and small values tend to follow small values .",
    "the time series is uncorrelated if @xmath48 and anti - correlated if @xmath49 .    using the dfa method",
    ", we analyze the price volatility and volume volatility time series by plotting in bins the relation between correlation exponent @xmath44 and the four financial factors , including stock lifetime , market capitalization , mean trading volume , and mean trading value . all the price volatility and volume volatility correlation exponents are significantly larger than 0.5 , suggesting the presence of long - term memory in both price volatility sequences and volume volatility sequences . in all of the plots ,",
    "the price volatility series shows a stronger long - term correlation than the volume volatility series .",
    "moreover , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) , @xmath44 on average increases for the stocks with a lifetime ranging from 350 days to 3800 days ( about 15 years ) , and then shows a slight decrease , suggesting that long - lasting stocks tend to have a persistent price and volume movement on large scales .",
    "the increasing exponent @xmath44 indicates that the volume volatility of older stocks is more correlated than that of younger stocks .",
    "this is consistent with the indication in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) that the volume volatility of older stocks are more auto - correlated .",
    "figures  [ fig6](b ) ,  [ fig6](c ) , and  [ fig6](d ) show that there is no systematic tendency relation between @xmath44 and market capitalization , trading volume , and trading value .",
