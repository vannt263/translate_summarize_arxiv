    "32 planar hpge detectors and 16 thin @xmath0cd metallic foils between them were used in the tgv-2 experiment @xcite , and array of cdznte room temperature semiconductors was used in the cobra studies @xcite . at the first stage of our investigations @xcite , @xmath0cdwo@xmath1 crystal enriched in @xmath0cd to 66% with mass of 216 g was used as a scintillating detector . at the second stage , described here , it is operated in low background set - up together with four hpge detectors enhancing sensitivity to some @xmath2 processes with emission of @xmath27 quanta .",

    "the @xmath0cdwo@xmath1 scintillator ( @xmath28 mm , mass 216 g ) was grown from deeply purified cd ( 66% of @xmath0cd ) by the low - thermal - gradient czochralski method @xcite .",

    "the data were accumulated during 13085 h. the pulse - shape discrimination based on the mean time of the scintillation signal @xcite was applied to discriminate events caused by @xmath27 and @xmath38 particles from those induced by @xmath39 s .",

    "in general , we did not find any peculiarities in the data accumulated with the @xmath0cdwo@xmath1 and hpge detectors that could be ascribed to the @xmath2 processes in @xmath0cd .",
    "thus we give only the half - life limits according to a formula : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the number of @xmath0cd nuclei in the @xmath0cdwo@xmath1 crystal ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 is the detection efficiency , @xmath50 is the time of measurements , and @xmath51 is the number of events of the effect searched for , which can be excluded at a given confidence level ( c.l . ) .",
    "we have analyzed different data to estimate limits on the @xmath2 processes in @xmath0cd .",
    "for instance , to derive the value of @xmath51 for the @xmath52 decay of @xmath0cd to the ground state of @xmath0pd , the @xmath0cdwo@xmath1 anticoincidence spectrum was fitted by the model built from the components of the background and the effect searched for .",
    "the best fit , achieved in the energy interval @xmath53 kev , gives the area of the effect @xmath54 counts , thus providing no evidence for the effect . in accordance with the feldman - cousins procedure @xcite",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath55 counts at 90% c.l .",
    "taking into account the detection efficiency within the interval given by the monte carlo simulation ( 69.3% ) and the 95.5% efficiency of the pulse - shape discrimination to select @xmath27 and @xmath38 events , we got the half - life limit : @xmath56 yr . the excluded distribution of the @xmath52 decay of @xmath0cd to the ground state of @xmath0pd is shown in fig .  1 ( right ) .",

    "the coincidence energy spectrum of the @xmath0cdwo@xmath1 detector is presented in fig .  2 ( left ) .",
    "there are only 115 events in the energy interval @xmath57 mev , while the simulated background model ( built by using the parameters of the anticoincidence spectrum fit ) contains 108 counts .",
    "we have estimated values of @xmath51 for the @xmath2 processes in @xmath0cd in different energy intervals .",
    "some of the excluded distributions are presented in fig .  2 ( left ) ;",
    "corresponding @xmath58 limits are given in table  1 .",
    "in particular , the half - life limit on the @xmath59 decay is equal @xmath60  yr .",
    "this value is close to theoretical predictions of @xcite where @xmath61 yr was calculated .",
    "using the relation between the effective nuclear matrix element ( nme ) for @xmath59 decay : @xmath62 yr @xcite , one can obtain a limit on nme for @xmath59 decay of @xmath0cd to the ground state of @xmath0pd as : @xmath63    we also used the data accumulated by the hpge detectors to estimate limits on the @xmath2 processes in @xmath0cd .",
    "for instance , in neutrinoless @xmath22 capture we assume that the energy excess is taken away by bremsstrahlung @xmath27 quanta with energy @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the binding energy of @xmath66-th captured electron on the atomic shell , and @xmath67 is the energy of the populated ( g.s . or excited ) level of @xmath0pd . in case of transition to an excited level , in addition to the initial @xmath27 quantum , other @xmath27 s will be emitted in the nuclear deexcitation process .",
    "for example , to derive a limit on the @xmath68 capture in @xmath0cd to the ground state of @xmath0pd the energy spectrum accumulated with the hpge detectors was fitted in the energy interval @xmath69 kev by a simple function ( first degree polynomial function to describe background plus gaussian peak at the energy 2726.7 kev with the energy resolution fwhm@xmath70 kev to describe the effect searched for ) .",
    "the fit gives an area of the peak @xmath71 counts , with no evidence for the effect .",
    "according to @xcite we took 11.4 events which can be excluded with 90% c.l . taking into account the detection efficiency for @xmath27 quanta with energy 2726.7 kev in the experimental conditions ( 1.89% ) , we have set the following limit for the @xmath68 capture of @xmath0cd to the ground state of @xmath0pd : @xmath72 yr .",
    "the excluded peaks are shown in fig .  2 ( right ) .",
    "some of the obtained half - life limits on different @xmath2 processes in @xmath0cd are given in table 1 , where results of the most sensitive previous experiments are also given for comparison .",
