    "variability is a fundamental property of the radiation - driven winds of early - type stars .",
    "discrete absorption components ( dacs ) are the most prominent features of wind variability .",
    "they migrate from red to blue in uv p  cygni lines , narrowing in width when they approach the terminal velocity  of the stellar wind .",
    "obviously , dacs can not be observed in saturated p  cygni profiles ; however , the steep blue edges of these profiles often show regular shifts of up to 10% in velocity .",
    "edge variability is probably related to the dac behaviour , but the precise phase relation has not been unraveled yet . for a more extensive introduction and various examples of the dac phenomenon",

    "it should be emphasized that in the planning phase of this project the sampling times of the targets have been carefully tuned to each individual star , based on sample spectra collected in earlier pilot studies . as a result , in paper",
    "i , time series of more than 600 high - resolution ultraviolet spectra of 10 o - type stars were presented . in this follow - up paper",
    "we analyse the series of spectra obtained with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( iue ) in a quantitative manner and evaluate the behaviour of dacs and edge variability in the uv p  cygni lines . in the following section we describe the data analysis and",
    "present our methods to isolate and model the dacs in the ultraviolet spectra .",
    "furthermore , a period - search analysis was performed to derive the characteristic timescales of both dac and edge variability .",
    "the results of the modeling and the time series analyses are presented in section 3 .",
    "we compare the results obtained for different stars in section 4 and draw general conclusions . in the last section we discuss the observed variability and its regular behaviour in terms of the corotating interaction regions model of cranmer & owocki ( @xcite ) .",
    "high - resolution ( @xmath1010,000 ) ultraviolet spectra of the 10 studied o - type stars ( see table  1 for our sample ) were obtained with the short wavelength prime ( swp ) camera on board the iue satellite .",
    "time series of the relevant uv p  cygni lines are presented in paper  i , together with a detailed description of the targets and their observational history . for each of the 10 o  stars , the high - resolution swp spectra form a homogeneous dataset resulting from similar observational constraints and a uniform reduction procedure ( cf .",
    "paper  i ) .      to isolate the migrating dacs from the underlying p  cygni profiles ,",
    "a template ( in this case a `` least - absorption '' ) spectrum is needed that represents the undisturbed - wind profile to which the p  cygni profile apparently returns after the passage of a dac ( e.g.  prinja et al.@xcite , paper  i ) .",
    "subsequent division of the individual spectra by this template then results in quotient spectra , which are used to model the dacs ( see next subsection ) .",
    "close inspection of the intrinsic variability in the p  cygni lines ( cf .",
    "paper  i ) suggests that the observed changes are mainly due to variations in the wind column in front of the stellar disk , since the wind variability is only found in the blue - shifted absorption troughs , and not in the p  cygni emission peaks . on the one hand , this is what one would expect in the case of relatively modest variations in the density and/or velocity structure of the stellar - wind . to illustrate this",
    ", one could imagine a small blob of gas in the stellar wind absorbing photons at a particular velocity and reemitting them isotropically .",
    "when this blob is in the line of sight , it leaves a blue - shifted absorption feature , so that we can `` count '' all the photons that were scattered out of the absorbing column . for a blob outside the line of sight",
    ", only the few photons that are reemitted in the direction of the observer can be detected .",
    "on the other hand , the absorbing blob has to cover a significant fraction of the stellar disk in order to give rise to an observable change in the p  cygni absorption .",
    "our basic assumption is that the changes in the p  cygni profiles are caused by variable amounts of additional absorption caused by material in the line of sight . in terms of sobolev optical depth , a change in p  cygni absorption could be due to a ( local ) change in the wind density or the velocity gradient .",
    "the simplest construction of a reference template spectrum is to select the highest flux point ( per wavelength bin ) from the available spectra .",
    "such a procedure applied to non - variable parts of the spectrum would , however , yield a template that is systematically too high because of instrumental and photon noise . here",
    "we describe a method which automatically corrects for this overestimation .",
    "our method is based on a paper by peat & pemberton ( @xcite ) which documents computer programs for the automatic reduction of stellar spectrograms , in particular to locate the continuum level in a spectrogram .",
    "the large number of available spectra ( @xmath5 , listed in table  1 ) enables the construction of a `` noise - corrected '' template spectrum .",
    "we assume that the flux points not disturbed by dacs are normally distributed with mean value @xmath11 and variance @xmath12 within each wavelength bin ( taken 0.1   ) at wavelength @xmath8 .",
    "we choose a suitable number @xmath4 ( last column in table  1 ) , not too small , but small enough to have the @xmath4 highest flux values in every bin sufficiently free from dacs .",
    "the underlying assumption is that if the p  cygni profiles always return to the same flux level after passage of a dac , a sufficient number of flux points per wavelength bin will be available ( provided that the total number of spectra is large enough ) to define the undisturbed - wind profile .",
    "we can compute @xmath13 and @xmath14 of these @xmath4 highest flux values for each wavelength bin .",
    "we then assume that the `` undisturbed '' flux points belong to the wing of a normal distribution in any given part of the spectrum , which allows us to derive @xmath15 and @xmath16 from @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in parts of the spectrum that do not vary intrinsically ( such as the continuum ) , the values obtained for @xmath15 ( and @xmath16 ) should represent the average spectrum and the noise ; this provides an independent check of the validity of our assumption .",
    "for our application we used the distribution function @xmath17 for a normal distribution given by : @xmath18 the distribution of the @xmath4 highest points is a truncated normal distribution , i.e.  @xmath19 running from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , with @xmath20 from eq .  ( 5 ) .",
    "so we have for the average @xmath13 and variance @xmath14 of the @xmath4 highest flux points : @xmath22 @xmath23 the ratio @xmath24 is given by : @xmath25 with @xmath26 after substitution of these expressions in eq .",
    "( 2 ) we can relate @xmath13 to @xmath15 : @xmath27 thus , from @xmath13 and @xmath28 we can compute @xmath15 ; @xmath29 is the inverse complementary error function of @xmath30 ( eq .  4 ) and is computed iteratively , using an adequate approximation for the complementary error function . substituting @xmath13 from eq .  ( 6 ) in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we obtain a relation between @xmath16 and @xmath14 , the variance in the @xmath4 highest points : @xmath31 in principle , this solves the problem : eq .",
    "( 7 ) gives @xmath28 as @xmath32 times a function of @xmath5 and @xmath4 only , and then eq .",
    "( 6 ) gives @xmath15 as a best estimate of the template .",
    "however , @xmath32 is derived from a small number of points and has a large statistical uncertainty . through eq .",
    "( 6 ) these uncertainties translate into noise in the template spectrum .",
    "henrichs et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have shown that for iue spectra an empirical relation can be found between @xmath28 and flux , which implies that we can derive @xmath28 from @xmath15 ( see also howarth & smith @xcite ) .",
    "this relation is based on much better statistics and gives more reliable results .",
    "since @xmath15 is the quantity we want to derive , we have to estimate @xmath28 from @xmath13 , so that in principle the scheme has to be iterated . in practice , these iterations are barely needed .",
    "the method was tested numerically by selecting a given number of highest flux points from a gaussian distribution ( with known @xmath15 and @xmath28 ) of randomly chosen points .",
    "the method was found to be extremely powerful : for @xmath33 0.01 we predicted @xmath15 within 2% .",
    "the higher the value of @xmath24 , the better the obtained estimate for @xmath15 ( and @xmath28 ) , but we are limited by the fact that only a few points per wavelength bin are not disturbed by intrinsic variability .    in fig .  1 we present , as an example , the  resonance doublet of .",
    "from the available 149 spectra we selected the 5 highest flux points per wavelength bin and computed the average @xmath13 and variance @xmath14 .",
    "we show @xmath34 and @xmath35 by a dotted line in the upper and lower panel of fig .  1 , respectively .",
    "the average flux points and standard deviations of all 149 spectra are shown as a thin line .",
    "note that the average of the 5 highest flux points @xmath34 lies , as expected , systematically above the template @xmath11 , and that in the lower panel the scatter in @xmath32 is large .",
    "the derived @xmath11 and @xmath36 are represented by a thick line .",
    "we see that the template @xmath11 and the average spectrum are identical in the continuum regions , but that the template deviates significantly from the average spectrum in the variable resonance line . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "1 the similarity between the estimated @xmath28 ( thick line ) and the measured variance ( thin line ) is obvious in the wavelength regions outside the  line .    figs .  2 and 3 display the relevant parts of the derived template spectra .",
    "shown are the p  cygni profiles including dacs .",
    "for comparison , a representative observed spectrum ( thin line ) is shown in the same panel .",
    "the quality of the template can be checked by searching for `` emission '' in the obtained quotient spectra ( i.e.where the flux exceeds unity ) , which should be present if the template spectrum still contains additional absorption with respect to some of the observed spectra .",
    "another check is to compare the variance @xmath14 in the selected highest flux points in the variable line with the value of @xmath14 in a constant part of the spectrum with a comparable exposure level .",
    "for example , in the case of  we were forced on these grounds to select only the two highest flux points .",
    "although a logical consequence of our method is that a few points ( e.g.  at least one per wavelength bin for ) in the quotient spectra will exceed unity , we found that these points are not randomly distributed among the quotient spectra , but are concentrated in only a few of them .",
    "this means that we can only improve on this by enlarging the sample of observed spectra .",
    "fortunately , the `` emission '' in the quotient spectra of  is modest . for the other stars this problem turns out to be even less important .    in order to investigate whether there exists such a thing as an undisturbed wind profile which represents the state to which the wind returns after the passage of a dac",
    ", we constructed templates based on the spectra of the individual datasets and compared them .",
    "the most challenging case is that of , where the template we used is based on the two highest flux points out of a total of 124 spectra . as can be expected , the resulting templates are identical ( within the noise ) in the continuum regions of the spectrum , but differ in the absorption troughs of the p  cygni lines . of the templates based on the individual datasets prior to 1994 ,",
    "the october 1991 template ( 36 spectra ) is closest to the template we used , but clearly contains more absorption in the blue doublet component ( fig . 4 ,  doublet ) .",
    "we also constructed a template from a dataset of 70 spectra of  collected during a campaign lasting 10 days in october 1994 ( henrichs et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which are not comprised in the sample studied in this paper .",
    "the october 1994 template resembles the template we constructed from all spectra until 1991 even more , but also here additional absorption is found at high velocities .",
    "this demonstrates that , given a sufficient timespan covered by the dataset , our method is capable of finding the same underlying wind profile using different datasets ; in the case of , however , only at low and intermediate velocities . for the latter star we have to conclude that in october 1991 and october 1994 the high - velocity part of the wind has a larger optical depth compared to other campaigns , which could be due to long - term variability .",
    "the isolated dacs in a quotient spectrum , obtained after division of an observed spectrum by the template , are modeled in the way described in henrichs et al .",
    "( @xcite , see also telting & kaper @xcite ) .",
    "the dacs are assumed to be formed by plane - parallel slabs of material in the line of sight , giving rise to an absorption component with central optical depth @xmath37 and ( doppler ) broadening parameter @xmath38 .",
    "the intensity of the component is described by : @xmath39 with the gaussian profile function @xmath40\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the velocity with respect to the stellar rest frame and @xmath42 the doppler displacement at line center . with the ( reasonable ) assumption that the displacement @xmath42 and broadening parameter @xmath38 are identical for the absorption components in both lines of the resonance doublet , the dacs in both doublet components can be modeled simultaneously knowing the doublet separation @xmath43 and the ratio in oscillator strength .",
    "this leaves only three free parameters for each pair of dacs .",
    "these parameters ( @xmath42 , @xmath38 , and @xmath37 ) are determined by means of a @xmath44-method in order to obtain the best fit . the signal - to - noise ratio in each point of the quotient spectrum",
    "is estimated using the empirically determined dependence of this ratio on the flux ( paper  i ) .",
    "the @xmath44 criterion then gives the formal errors in the derived parameters ( telting & kaper @xcite ) .",
    "we fitted our model to spectral data within the velocity range @xmath453000 to @xmath462500  with respect to the principal ( short - wavelength ) doublet component . from these parameters",
    "we determine the column density @xmath47 associated with the absorption components ( henrichs et al .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath48    as an example , we show in figs .  2 and 3 model fits ( thick line ) to quotient spectra which were obtained after division of a representative spectrum ( thin line , left - hand panel ) by the template ( thick line ) .",
    "in most cases , a number of components were modeled simultaneously , with a maximum of 4 dacs in one doublet component .",
    "furthermore , all fit parameters were kept free . as an initial condition we used the results of the previous fit and modeled the spectra in a sequence determined by the time of observation .",
    "sometimes we had to go back and forth through the dataset when it appeared that we had missed the first ( weak ) signs of the development of a new dac at low velocity . in some cases we had to correct for bad normalization in the quotient spectrum by allowing for a very weak and wide ( sometimes a few thousand ) absorption component .",
    "this way we were able to determine the central velocity and width of the other components with reasonable accuracy . in these cases",
    "the derived column densities are , however , less accurate .      we also inspected the p  cygni lines for the occurrence of _ periodic _ variability .",
    "the spectral lines were normalized to the level of the surrounding continuum through division by a first - order polynomial .",
    "the period - finding algorithm we applied , consists of an ordinary fourier transformation for non - equidistant temporal sampling , followed by a clean stage in which the window function , which is due to incomplete temporal sampling of the stellar signal , is iteratively removed from the fourier spectrum ( roberts et al .",
    "the continuous observations from space result in a very nice window function which does not include a peak at a period of one day ( see fig .  5 for an example ) .",
    "the window function was removed in 400 iterations with a gain of 0.2 .",
    "the studied frequency range runs from 0.01 to 10 cycle  day@xmath49 , with a frequency step of 0.01 c / d .",
    "a fourier spectrum is computed for each wavelength bin ( 0.1   ) .",
    "the power in the 2-dimensional periodograms resulting from the clean analyses can , provided that the window function could be satisfactorily removed , be transformed back to amplitudes in continuum units ( amplitude = 2@xmath50 ) , contrary to the summed power in the summed 1-dimensional periodograms .",
    "more details on the used method and references can be found in gies & kullavanijaya ( @xcite ) and telting & schrijvers ( @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that for several of our targets the derived period is close to , or sometimes even larger than the time span @xmath51 covered by our observations . in these cases",
    "we can only conclude that a long - term variation is present in the data , which may or may not be periodic .",
    "we have indicated these `` periods '' by putting them between square brackets ( e.g. [ 6.2@xmath521.8  d ] ) .",
    "an outcome of the period - search analysis is the phase information . for a given period , the corresponding sinusoid s phase ( in our figures in units of radians )",
    "is known in each wavelength bin .",
    "for example , periodic features moving from the red to the blue side of a spectral line will give rise to a shift in phase with wavelength .",
    "owocki et al .",
    "( @xcite ) used the observed phase diagram of a periodic modulation in uv resonance lines of the b0.5  ib star hd  64760 as supporting evidence for the occurrence of corotating streams in the wind . in this particular example , however , the so - called `` phase bowing '' did not correspond to the evolution of the , though present , dacs , but to ( sinusoidal ) modulations in flux at low and intermediate velocities ( fullerton et al .",
    "@xcite ) . it would be very interesting to know whether these findings also apply to the here studied o - star wind variability .",
    "in this section we describe the results based on the modeling of dacs in the uv p  cygni lines and period - search analyses for each star separately . for some stars",
    "several time series are available , so that we can study the behaviour of dacs also on a longer ( yearly ) timescale .",
    "we have chosen to analyse in detail only those time series ( from the sample presented in paper  i ) that exhibit significant variability and cover a sufficiently long time interval .    in most cases",
    "the  resonance doublet was used to model the dacs ; the other uv resonance lines (  and ) are often saturated .",
    "the two main - sequence stars in our sample ,  and , are variable in the  ( and ) profiles , but not in the  doublet , which is too weak to show any wind features .",
    "for the supergiants and  we modeled the dac behaviour in both the  and the  doublet .",

    "did not detect any significant variations , except for some marginal variability in the blue edge of the  and  lines ( paper  i ) .    to facilitate a visual comparison ,",
    "the figures showing the time dependence of the dac parameters are plotted on scale .",
    "the scale of the time axis is identical in all figures . for a given star ,",
    "the scale of the vertical axes is the same for each dataset .",
    "we observed  four times in the period 19871991 .",
    "fig .  6 presents an overview of the dac behaviour in the  resonance doublet and enables a visual comparison to be made between the different datasets .",
    "as discussed in paper  i , the variability pattern is characteristic for a given star , but shows detailed changes from year to year .",
    "the timescale of variability ( i.e.  the recurrence timescale of dacs ) and the range in velocity over which variability is observed , remain the same .",
    "the strength of the absorption components , however , varies from event to event .",
    "a minimum - absorption template was constructed from the 124 spectra of , which was used to generate quotient spectra ( fig .",
    "the isolated dacs were fitted to a model profile as described in section 2.2 ; in figs .  7 and 8 the evolution of the dac parameters ( @xmath42 , @xmath38 and @xmath37 ) are presented for the different sets of spectra . in the upper panels of figs .  7 and 8",
    "the total equivalent width ( integrated over velocity rather than wavelength ) of the quotient spectra is given as a function of time .",
    "the error bars represent 1@xmath32-errors ( cf .",
    "telting & kaper @xcite ) .",
    "we connected the points that we identify as belonging to the same dac event .",
    "the criteria for selection of these points are based on the assumption of continuity in the three fit parameters and the column density .",
    "the derived column density of a dac first increases and then decreases ; a maximum is reached at a velocity of about @xmath451500 .",
    "the maximum in @xmath47 is 5@xmath5310@xmath54 @xmath55 .",
    "the other dac parameters vary less strictly .",
    "the maximum width of a strong component is about 750  just after its appearance at low ( @xmath561000 ) velocity .",
    "we have modeled narrow components at their terminal velocity having widths smaller than 50 , i.e.  nearly down to the spectral resolution of the iue spectrograph , but not as narrow as the dacs observed with the ghrs onboard hst ( shore et al .",
    "the maximum central optical depth of a dac that is observed for  is @xmath571.2 .",
    "two different types of dacs can be discriminated in the  doublet of : ( 1 ) strong absorption components that remain visible for more than two days ( filled symbols ) and ( 2 ) more short - lived , sometimes suddenly disappearing dacs ( open symbols ) , preceding or following a strong component within half a day .    for each dataset",
    "we performed a period analysis on the , , and  resonance lines and the  subordinate line .",
    "the fourier analyses clearly detect periodicity , the cleanest periodogram being obtained for the october 1991 dataset ( see fig .  9 for the results ) , when  was covered for the longest period of time ( @xmath58 4.4  d ;",
    "consequently , all periods derived from this dataset that are close to or longer than 4.4  day are not well determined and will be printed between square brackets ) . in each wavelength bin",
    "a cleaned fourier spectrum is calculated and plotted as a function of frequency ( in cycles  day@xmath49 ) , the power being represented in levels of grey .",
    "periodic variability is detected in the blue - shifted absorption troughs of the  doublet ( also in the other studied lines ) .",

    "also a longer period is detected at the blue edge ( between @xmath452950 and @xmath452350 ) of the profiles , at [ 3.8@xmath521.0 ] and [ 3.6@xmath520.9 ]  day , respectively ( fig .",
    "10 , dotted lines ) .",
    "these ( saturated ! ) resonance lines also include the 2-day period at lower velocities ( ranging from about @xmath452000 to 0 with respect to the rest wavelength of the red doublet component ) .",
    "the longer period is in all three cases consistent with a period of 4 days , i.e.  twice the period observed at lower velocities .",

    "the campaigns covering the shortest period of time ( 1988 and 1989 ) result in a higher weight to a 1-day period ( 1.0@xmath520.1  d ) .",
    "the evidence for a longer period in the blue edge of the profiles , such as found in 1991 , is not very strong .",
    "this is not surprising given the short time span covered by these observations .",
    "why do the observed variations at higher velocities exhibit a longer period , about twice as long as at lower velocities ? if our interpretation is correct , this factor of two difference in periodicity is due to the peculiar dac behaviour in the wind lines of . in paper",
    "i we pointed out that in this star strong dacs reach different asymptotic velocities , leading to crossings of successive components .",
    "we found that the dac s asymptotic velocity alternates between 2050  and 2275  ( in figs .  7 and 8",
    "the high - velocity dac is indicated by filled squares ) .",
    "therefore , only one out of two dacs would reach the far blue edge of the profile resulting in a frequency of once every four days at the highest velocities .",
    "it turns out that if one wants to understand the edge variability , a detailed knowledge of the dac behaviour is essential .",
    "the recognition that the asymptotic velocity of a dac can have two different values has important consequences for the use of this diagnostic to determine the terminal velocity of a stellar wind ( henrichs et al .",

    "only the results are plotted for the 1987 ( crosses ) and 1991 ( filled circles ) datasets ; the 1988 and 1989 datasets give similar results , although there a 1-day period is dominant ( the phase diagrams are , however , almost identical to those of the 2-day period ) . the phase ( in radians ) is plotted as a function of position in the line ( measured in velocity with respect to the blue doublet component ) for the three resonance lines and the  subordinate line .",
    "the phase has only a physical meaning if at the given velocity the period is detected .",
    "we plot the phase for points with power exceeding 10@xmath60 , which is just above the level of the continuum in the power spectrum ( fig .",
    "the error in phase does not follow straightforwardly from the fourier analysis ; a possibility is to bin the data and use the spread in phase as an indication of the error .",

    "we suspect that at day 9.8 a new `` dac '' replaces the former one at @xmath451500  and remains at that velocity until day 12 .",
    "this would mean that the absorption component at @xmath451500  follows a different cycle than the `` rapid '' dacs appearing once every day .",
    "the variations might be interpreted as caused by two dac patterns superimposed on each other : a `` slow '' pattern consisting of dacs with an asymptotic velocity of @xmath451500 , and a `` fast '' pattern of dacs that reach higher velocities ( @xmath662150 ) .",
    "the rapid dac pattern is also ( weakly ) present in the  line , the dacs can be traced down to a velocity of @xmath45200 .",

    ", we can identify _ two _ different series of dacs moving through the  profile ( fig . 20 ) : series a , which appears at jd 52.8 , 53.9 , 55.5 , 56.5 , and series b , appearing at jd 53.4 , 54.7 , 56.0 ( the sampling time of the uv data is 0.1 day ) .",
    "the time lag between the two series is about half a day , series a followed by b. furthermore , it turns out that dacs belonging to different series , reach different asymptotic velocities : series a accelerates to a velocity of about @xmath452450  , which is @xmath68250  higher than the velocity reached by series b. thus , like in the case of , the dac s asymptotic velocity shows an alternating behaviour .",
    "an important difference is , however , that in  the time span between two successive dacs with different asymptotic velocity ( i.e.belonging to different series ) is equal to the dac recurrence timescale , while in  the time lag between series a and b is about 0.5 days , i.e. not equal to the dac recurrence timescale ( 1.4 days ) .",
    "simultaneous  observations indicate that incipient  emission is observed prior to the appearance of dacs belonging to series a ( kaper et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and not in between series a and b. alternatively , each dac event in  might consist of two separate components , the event starting with an absorption component from series a , followed half a day later by one from series b.    when comparing the different datasets , typical dac patterns are recognized ( see also the figures in paper  i ) . in paper  i we pointed out the remarkable similarity between the dac pattern in the  time series obtained in 1986 and 1988 . in the figures we labeled the dacs showing similar behaviour with the same symbol .",
    "like for , the dac behaviour suggests that the full cycle of variability is twice the dac recurrence timescale , which is 2.8 days . in exceptional cases ( as , for example , in the time series of september 1987 demonstrated by the absence of filled squares ) a dac seems to be missing",
    "this is another indication that the general dac behaviour is very regular over the years , but that small though significant differences do occur .",
    "we note that with our fit procedure it is difficult to resolve two overlapping absorption components of comparable strength , and that such double features will sometimes fit as one single component , which causes unavoidable discontinuities in the time sequence of the fit parameters .",

    "the phase diagrams for the 1.4-day period ( phase in radians ) are very similar from year to year ( fig .",

    "26 ) behave similarly as observed in other o  stars : the column density increases after the appearance of a dac and reaches a maximum ( in this case 2.5@xmath5310@xmath54 @xmath55 ) when a central velocity of about @xmath451500  is reached , although this is rather difficult to determine because of the problems mentioned earlier . in every spectrum ,",
    "an absorption component is fitted at a velocity close to @xmath452100 .",

    "the  profile ( long - dashed - dotted lines ) produces the 1.4  d period ( 1.3@xmath520.1  d ) too , the  line vaguely indicates a possible harmonic at 0.72@xmath520.03  d. the october 1991 data also show evidence for a period close to [ 5 ] days ( although this is longer than the 4.5  d coverage ) .",

    "the characteristic timescale of variability is , however , longer than 4 days if the modeled absorption components belong to the same event , as was observed in the case of  and .",
    "another argument in favour of a timescale significantly longer than 1.4  day is that the acceleration timescale , in this case at least several days , is usually comparable to the dac recurrence timescale .",
    "the fourier analysis applied to the  time series of  results in a peak at [ 6.8@xmath522.3  d ] ( and not at 1.4  d ) , but this period is longer than the time coverage of the data .",

    "dacs are detected at higher velocities in the resonance lines of hd  64760 and are variable on a timescale longer than @xmath91 .",
    "the phase diagrams for the 2-day period detected in the  october 1991 dataset clearly show evidence for phase bowing .",
    "a maximum in phase occurs around @xmath451200  , i.e. about the central velocity at which the dacs usually appear ( fig .  8) .",
    "the maximum phase lag @xmath105 is about one radian , similar to the phase lag observed in hd  64760 .",
    "the increasing strength of the dac might explain the subsequent decrease in phase towards higher and lower velocities .",
    "the further acceleration and narrowing of the dacs is reflected by the increasing slope of the phase towards higher velocities .",
    "this description of the phase behaviour is only qualitative ; detailed modeling of the phase diagram falls beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "an important difference with hd  64760 is that the dacs themselves seem to be responsible for the observed phase bowing .",
    "phase bowing is not evident in the phase diagrams for the other o  stars in our sample .",
    "it has only been found in , which is perhaps not surprising , because the other stars in our sample do not exhibit such strong wind variability down to the lowest wind velocities .",
    "the `` classical '' picture we have of dac behaviour , and which is supported by the observations analysed in this paper , is that broad absorption components appear at low velocity which evolve towards higher velocity while narrowing .",
    "the application of fourier analyses resulted in the determination of well - constrained periods , not only at low velocity , but over the full width of the lines . to check the outcome of the fourier analysis we constructed diagrams showing the variation of flux as a function of time in a each velocity bin .",
    "it indeed appears that the flux varies sinusoidally with time , especially at low and intermediate velocities . in some cases",
    "the fourier analysis invokes an additional sinusoid to accommodate the weak precursor of the next dac ( resulting in the addition of a shorter - period sinusoid ) or a gradual change ( longer period ) .",
    "the latter occurs for example when two subsequent dacs reach a different asymptotic velocity .",

    "( @xcite ) to conclude that in this star a distinction can be made between a sinusoidal modulation in flux at low and intermediate wind velocities and variations due to the propagation of dacs at higher velocities . a 2.4-day ( or 1.2-day )",
    "periodicity is connected with the modulation which clearly shows the occurrence of phase bowing ; the dacs vary on a longer timescale .",
    "thus , in hd  64760 two different kinds of wind variability are observed : flux modulation and dac propagation . because of the observed phase bowing , fullerton et al .",
    "( @xcite ) interpret the modulation to be due to cirs , whereas the origin of the dacs is not clear .",
    "our results on  indicate a different picture : in this star the flux modulation and phase bowing are caused by the dacs themselves . that the propagation of dacs leads to a sinusoidal modulation of the flux in a given velocity bin",
    "is due to the shape of the dacs , which can be accurately fit with an exponential gaussian . at low velocity",
    "these gaussians have widths of several hundreds km / s . at high velocity",
    "they become very narrow .",
    "when the dac moves through the resonance line , the flux in a given velocity bin changes gradually , following the gaussian shape of the dac . at high velocities , where the dacs are narrow , the flux changes more irregularly , because the dacs `` pile up '' at about the same asymptotic velocity before they vanish .",
    "this might explain why the flux gradually changes when a dac moves through a velocity bin , but not why this modulation is sinusoidal . in our interpretation , this is because not only the recurrence timescale , but also the acceleration timescale of the dac is proportional to the rotation period of the star .",
    "since these two timescales are identical , a sinusoidal shape of the flux versus time plots is expected .",
    "thus , the dac behaviour in o - star winds can result in a sinusoidal modulation of the flux in each velocity bin .    with our definition of the template",
    ", the maximum of the sinusoidal modulation corresponds to the `` undisturbed , underlying wind profile '' , so that all variations are by definition due to additional absorption .",
    "from the point of view of fullerton et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , in the case of hd  64760 the template might be better defined as the zero - point of the modulation , i.e. the `` average wind profile '' .",
    "with such a template , it is not possible to model the dacs they observe in the resonance lines of hd  64760 at high velocity as absorption components , which is the reason for our approach .      the o  stars , , , and  were observed several times in the period 19861992 .",
    "the variability pattern , characteristic for a given star , can be recognized from year to year , though detailed changes occur .",
    "the same wind variability timescale @xmath91 is detected every year .",
    "sometimes a different period gives the highest peak in the power spectrum ( 1988 and 1989 ,  1989 ) , but this might be due to the short time coverage of these datasets . for",
    "there seems to be a clear difference between the observed variability timescale in october 1989 , february 1991 , and october 1991 . in 1989",
    "a period of [ 2.5@xmath520.8  d ] is dominant , in february 1991 a period of [ 4.3@xmath521.2  d ] ( as well as 1.4@xmath520.1  d ) , and in october 1991 a period of 1.4@xmath520.2  d. if stellar rotation is setting the timescale of wind variability , one would not expect this timescale to vary from year to year .",
    "what could in principle vary is the number of features observed per rotation period . in the case of  the difference in observed periods",
    "could be explained as different integer fractions of the stellar rotation period : 1.4 , 2.8 , 4.2  d ; or 1.3 , 2.6 , 3.9  d. in section  5 we will address the point whether the dac recurrence timescale can be used to determine the stellar rotation period .",
    "although the characteristic variability timescale remains the same , the dac strengths and asymptotic velocities exhibit changes from campaign to campaign .",
    "the dac behaviour in  seems to be the most constant over the years ; clear differences are observed for ( fig .",
    "6 ) , , and .",
    "this indicates that the underlying clock might be the same , but that at least for some stars in our sample the pattern of large - scale structure in the stellar wind varies on a timescale of months to years .",
    "several models have been put forward to explain the observed properties of dacs .",
    "the expansion of a high - density layer in the stellar wind ( henrichs et al .",
    "@xcite ) gives a simple explanation for the time - dependent behaviour of dacs , but it gives no clue to the origin of the high - density layer .",
    "underhill & fahey ( @xcite ) tried to explain the existence and behaviour of dacs by postulating the existence of `` closed '' and `` open '' magnetic loops above the stellar surface from which parcels of gas are released in addition to a uniformly emitted steady stellar wind .",
    "a nice property of this model is that dacs are always expected to appear at the same rotational phase as long as the magnetic footpoints remain at the same location .",
    "dacs are found at the same velocity in resonance lines formed by different ions ( e.g.  lamers et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; therefore , dacs most - likely originate from regions which have a higher density ( or smaller velocity gradient ) than the ambient wind .",
    "these regions have to be geometrically extended , because : ( 1 ) practically all o  stars show dacs ; ( 2 ) they have to cover a significant fraction of the stellar disk to be observable .",
    "stellar rotation plays a dominant role in setting the timescale of variability ; a difference in flow time scale ( @xmath106 ) can not explain the observed dependence on @xmath86 . not only the cyclical recurrence , but also the acceleration of dacs is faster for more rapidly rotating stars .",
    "this suggests that the dac forming region rotates into and out of the line of sight .",
    "the observed increase and subsequent decrease of @xmath47 supports this picture ( figs .",
    "31 and 32 ) .",
    "most - promising is the corotating interacting regions model proposed by mullan ( @xcite , @xcite ) , in analogy with the corotating interacting regions in the solar wind which result from the interaction of fast and slow wind streams .",
    "recently , this model has been worked out by cranmer & owocki ( @xcite ) who performed two - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of corotating stream structure in the wind of a rotating o  star .",
    "the corresponding spiral - shaped , large - scale structure through which the wind material is flowing , was proposed by prinja & howarth ( @xcite ) based on observations of .",
    "simultaneous ultraviolet and h@xmath7 spectroscopy of a number of bright o  stars included in this study strongly support the cir model ( kaper et al .",
    "@xcite , see also fullerton et al .",
    "cranmer & owocki ( @xcite ) conclude from their model that the dacs are not formed in the cirs themselves , but originate in the so - called radiative - acoustic kinks trailing the cirs .",
    "the strong velocity gradient related to this kink results in a relatively large contribution to the sobolev optical depth .",
    "kaper et al .",
    "( @xcite ) show that a small phase lag might be present between the wind variations in the h@xmath7 line with respect to those observed in the uv resonance lines ; this would be consistent with the h@xmath7 variations originating in the cir and the dacs in the trailing kink .",
    "phase bowing suggests that the structures are curved , explaining why material at a given radial velocity rotates out of or into the line of sight first , followed by material moving at higher and lower velocities ( owocki et al .",
    "@xcite , cranmer & owocki @xcite ) .",
    "all nine o  stars with dacs show a decrease in phase towards higher velocities ; only one ( ) also shows a lag in phase towards lower velocities .",
    "the location @xmath107 in the wind where the fast flow first meets the slow stream depends on the equatorial rotation speed @xmath108 and the difference in ( terminal ) velocity between the fast and slow stream ( mullan @xcite ) : @xmath109\\ ] ] inwards of @xmath107 , the stellar wind might be rather smooth , so that variability is not detected at low wind velocities .",
    "also , the `` contrast '' between the fast and slow stream ( angular separation @xmath110 and @xmath111 ) is likely to vary from star to star . for large @xmath107",
    "it might well be that only a decrease in phase towards higher velocities will be detected .",
    "furthermore , the aspect angle might be an important factor ; e.g. the decrease in phase towards lower velocities is only observed when the line of sight includes the equatorial plane .",
    "the cir model only works for rotating stars with emerging wind flows of different kinematic structure .",
    "comparison between model and observations suggest that wind streams with relatively slow speed interact with the faster ambient wind , in stead of high - speed streams in a slow wind ( cranmer & owocki @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the asymptotic velocity reached by dacs might be somewhat lower than the terminal velocity of the ambient wind . in some stars we measure systematically different values of @xmath79 from event to event .",
    "this might be due to a difference in aspect angle , contrast , or both .",
    "[ [ the - origin - of - cirs - non - radial - pulsations - or - surface - magnetic - fields ] ] the origin of cirs : non - radial pulsations or surface magnetic fields ? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    in order to work , this model needs a certain structure imposed at the stellar surface to produce flows with different kinematical properties . two physical mechanisms that in principle could cause fast and slow streams in the wind are : ( i ) non - radial pulsations ( nrp ) , or ( ii ) surface magnetic fields .",
    "henrichs ( @xcite ) pointed out that the occurrence of dacs might be related to the presence of nrp at the stellar surface .",
    "nrp are detected ( or suspected ) in several o  stars ( cf .",
    "baade @xcite , fullerton et al .",
    "the associated temperature and velocity fields ( on the order of the sound speed ) could be responsible for the modulation of the boundary conditions at the base of the radiation - driven wind .",
    "our working hypothesis is that the outflow properties at the base of the wind are influenced by a magnetic field anchored in the star , which results in regions with different outflow properties rotating with the star .",
    "the presence of magnetic fields in early - type stars is difficult to prove with direct observational methods .",
    "magnetic fields with a strength of less than 100 gauss are theoretically predicted ( maheswaran & cassinelli @xcite ) , but not ( yet ) observable ( landstreet @xcite ) .",
    "recently , stahl et al .",
    "( @xcite ) argued that a surface magnetic field might be present in the o7  v star @xmath112  ori  c ; phase - locked photospheric and stellar - wind variations strongly suggest that this star is an oblique magnetic rotator .",
    "an upper limit of 70  g for the ( longitudinal ) magnetic field strength of  has been derived by henrichs et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "recent attempts to measure the longitudinal magnetic field strength in a sample of 10 fairly slowly rotating o  stars by mathys ( @xcite ) and collaborators did not result in a definite detection ( 1@xmath32 error bars of the order of 250300  g ) . some marginal measurements ( between 2 and 3@xmath32 ) suggest that weak fields might nevertheless be present , which could become detectable through a fairly modest improvement of the measurement accuracies .",
    "early - type stars are relatively short - lived objects and born out of interstellar matter that contains a magnetic field .",
    "the star with the strongest magnetic field known , `` babcock s star '' hd 215441 , is a b3  v star with a surface dipole field strength of 34 kgauss ( babcock @xcite , preston @xcite ) .",
    "this demonstrates that early - type stars can have very strong magnetic fields ( see also bohlender @xcite ) .",
    "these fields are expected to be frozen - in into the radiative envelopes of the stars ( see , for example mestel @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the end - products of early - type stars are mostly neutron stars with a strong magnetic field , which strength can be predicted by assuming magnetic flux conservation during the collapse of the core and the presence of a surface magnetic field of strength 10100  g in the progenitor .",
    "alternative scenarios for the formation of neutron - star magnetic fields exist as well .",
    "[ [ can - t_mboxscriptsize - rec - be - used - to - measure - p_mboxscriptsize - rot ] ] can @xmath98 be used to measure @xmath103 ? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
    "when we adopt the cir model in combination with an anchored surface magnetic field to explain the presence and cyclical behaviour of dacs , the characteristic timescale of variability in the winds of o - type stars _ is _ the rotation period of the star .",
    "our observations suggest that in several cases ( e.g.  and  where successive dacs have different asymptotical velocities ) the rotation period of the star is more likely equal to twice ( or an integral number times ) the recurrence timescale of dacs .",
    "this means that dacs are not only a diagnostic for deriving the terminal velocity of a stellar wind , but they can in principle be used to derive the rotation period of the star . in table  3 we list , based on the interpretation of the cyclical dac behaviour , the best estimate for the rotation period of the star . given an estimate of the stellar radius , the inclination of the rotation axis can thus be derived from @xmath86 .    in two cases (  and )",
    "the proposed rotation period exceeds the estimated maximum rotation period .",
    "it is likely that these rapidly rotating stars ( on the basis of the measured @xmath113 ) have a @xmath114 value close to unity , and the radius of these stars could be slightly underestimated . for  a radius of 15@xmath104 instead of 11@xmath104 would increase the maximum rotation period to 4 days ( see puls et al .",
    "walborn et al .",
    "( @xcite ) note that  is of luminosity class ii instead of iii which supports this conclusion .",
    "the uncertainty in the spectral class of ( denoted by the colon ) also indicates that the estimated radius might not be accurate .",
    "the dac behaviour in the uv resonance lines of a sample of 10 bright o  stars has been analysed in detail .",
    "the cyclical appearance and subsequent evolution of dacs is interpreted in terms of a model invoking fast and slow streams which interact due to the rotation of the underlying star .",
    "the interacting regions ( cirs ) corotate with the star while the wind material is flowing through them .",
    "the observations suggest that the stellar wind includes more than one cir , most likely two ( cf .",
    "kaper et al .",
    "the curvature of the cirs can in principle explain the observed phase behaviour ( bowing ) , which is detected in one of the o  stars in our sample .",
    "the wind variability periods we derive are a direct measure of the dac recurrence timescales and , in our interpretation , equal to an integer fraction ( most likely 1/2 ) of the stellar rotation period .",
    "the key issue is the origin of the cirs : are non - radial pulsations , surface magnetic fields , or other physical mechanisms responsible for the surface structure creating fast and slow wind streams ? this is the subject of our current investigations .",
