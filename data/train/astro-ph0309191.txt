    "recent observations of type ia supernovae @xcite supported by wmap measurements of anisotropy of the angular temperature fluctuations @xcite indicate that our universe is spatially flat and accelerating . on the other hand",
    ", the power spectrum of galaxy clustering @xcite indicates that about @xmath7 of critical density of the universe should be in the form of non - relativistic matter ( cold dark matter and baryons ) .",
    "the remaining , almost two thirds of the critical energy , may be in the form of a component having negative pressure ( dark energy ) .",
    "although the nature of dark energy is unknown , the positive cosmological constant term seems to be a serious candidate for the description of dark energy . in this case",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath8 and energy density @xmath9 remain constant with time and the corresponding mass density @xmath10 @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the hubble constant @xmath13 expressed in units of @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "although the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model with the cosmological constant and dust provides an excellent explanation of the snia data , the present value of @xmath8 is @xmath18 times smaller than value predicted by the particle physics model .",
    "many alternative condidates for dark energy have been advanced and some of them are in good agreement with the current observational constraints @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is a natural suggestion that @xmath8-term has a dynamical nature like in the inflationary scenario .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to consider the next simplest form of dark energy alternative to the cosmological constant @xmath19 for which the equation of state depends upon time in such a way that @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a coefficient of the equation of state parametrized by the scale factor or redshift .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that dynamics of such a system can be represented by one - dimensional hamiltonian flow @xmath22 where the overdot means differentiation with respect to the cosmological time @xmath23 and @xmath2 is a potential function of the scale factor @xmath24 given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the effective energy density which satisfies the conservation condition @xmath27 for example , for the @xmath28 model we have @xmath29 of course the trajectories of the system lie on the zero energy surface @xmath30 .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ eq:1 ] ) can be rewritten in the following form convenient for our current reconstruction of the equation of state from the potential function @xmath31 , namelly @xmath32 where @xmath33 , here overdot means differentiation with respect to some new reparametrized time @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "for example , for mixture of non - interacting fluids potential @xmath36 takes the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 for @xmath39-th fluid and @xmath40 @xmath41 ( similar to the quiessence model of dark energy ) .    due to the hamiltonian structure of friedmann - robertson - walker dynamics , with the general form of the equation of state @xmath1 , the dynamics",
    "is uniquely determined by the potential function @xmath2 ( or @xmath36 ) of the system . only for simplicity of presentation",
    "we assume that the universe is spatially flat ( in the opposite case trajectories of the system should be considered on the energy level @xmath42 ) .",
    "let us note that from the potential function we can obtain the equation of state coefficient @xmath43 , @xmath44 the term @xmath45 has a simple interpretation as an elasticity coefficient of the potential function with respect to the scale factor .",
    "thus from the potential function @xmath31 both @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be unambiguously calculated @xmath48",
    "as it is well known in a flat frw cosmology the luminosity distance @xmath49 and the coordinate distance @xmath50 to an object at redshift @xmath51 are simply related as @xmath52 ( @xmath53 here and elsewhere ) . from equation ( [ eq:8 ] )",

    "\\label{eq:9}\\ ] ]    it is crucial that formula ( [ eq:9 ] ) is purely kinematic and depends neither upon a microscopic model of matter , including the @xmath8-term , nor on a dynamical theory of gravity . due to existance of such a relation it would be possible to calculate the potential function which is : @xmath55^{-2}}{2(1+z)^{2}}. \\label{eq:10}\\ ] ]    this in turn allows us to reconstruct the potential @xmath56 from snia data .",
    "let us note that @xmath56 depends on the first derivative with respect to @xmath51 whereas @xmath57 is associated with the second derivative .",
    "let us also note that from of the potential function for a one - dimensional particle - universe moving in the configurational @xmath24 ( or @xmath58)-space can be reconstructed from recent measurements of angular size of high - z compact radio sources compiled by gurvits _",
    "the corresponding formula is @xmath59^{-2}}{2(1+z)^{2 } } , \\label{eq:10a}\\ ] ] where the luminosity distance @xmath49 and the angular distance @xmath60 are related by the simple formula @xmath61    since the potential function is related to the luminosity function by relation ( [ eq:10 ] ) one can determine both the class of trajectories in the phase plane @xmath62 and the hamiltonian form as well as reconstruct the quintessence parameter @xmath57 provided that the luminosity function @xmath63 is known from observations .",
    "now we can reconstruct the form of the potential function ( [ eq:10 ] ) using a natural ansatz introduced by sahni _",
    "_ @xcite . in this approach dark energy density which coincides with @xmath26",
    "is given as a truncated taylor series with respect to @xmath64 @xmath65 this leads to @xmath66 and @xmath67    the values of three parameters @xmath68,@xmath69,@xmath70 can be obtained by applying a standard fitting procedure to snia observational data based on the maximum likelihood method .",

    "our approach to the reconstruction of dynamics of the model is different from the standard approach in which @xmath57 is determined directly from the luminosity distance formula .",
    "it should be stressed out that the latter approach has an inevitable limitation because the luminosity distance dependence on @xmath57 is obtained through a multiple - integral relation that loses detailed information on @xmath57 @xcite . in our approach",
    "the reconstruction is simpler and more information on @xmath57 survives ( only a single integral is required ) .",
    "our approach is also different from the concept of reconstruction of potential of scalar fields considered in the context of quintessence @xcite .",
    "the key steps of our method are the following :    * 1 ) * we reconstruct the potential function @xmath2 for the hamiltonian dynamics of the quintessential universe from the luminosity distances of supernovas type ia ; + * 2 ) * we draw the best fit curves and confidence levels regions obtained from the statistical analysis of snia data ; + * 3 ) * we set the theoretically predicted forms of the potential functions on the confidence levels diagram ; + * 4 ) * those theoretical potential which escape from the @xmath4 confidence level is treated as being unfitted to observations ; + * 5 ) * we choose this potential function which lie near the best fit curve .",
    "+ our reconstruction is an effective statistical technique which can be used to compare a large number of theoretical models with observations . instead of estimating some revelant parameters for each model separately",
    ", we choose a model - independent fitting function and perform a maximum likelihood parameter estimation for it .",
    "the obtained confidence levels can be used to discriminate between the considered models . in this paper",
    "this technique is used to find the fitting function for the luminosity distance .    the additional argument which is important when considering",
    "the potential @xmath2 is that it allows to find some modification in the friedmann equations along the `` cardassian expansion scenario '' @xcite .",
    "this proposition is very intriguing because of additional terms , which automatically cause the acceleration of the universe @xcite .",
    "these modifications come from the fundamental physics and these terms can be tested using astronomical observation of distant type ia supernovae . for this aim",
    "the recent measurements of angular size of high - redshift compact radio sources can also be used @xcite .",
    "the important question is the reliable data available .",
    "we expect that supernovae data would improve greatly over next few years .",
    "the ongoing snap mission should gives us about 2000 type ia supernovae cases each year .",
    "this satellite mission and the next planned ones will increase the accuracy of data compared to data from the 90s . in our analysis",
    "we use the availale data starting from the three perlmutter samples ( sample a is the complete sample of 60 supernovae , but in the analysis it is also used sample b and c in which 4 and 6 outliers were excluded , respectively ) .",
    "the fit for the sample c is more robust and this sample was accepted as the base of our consideration . for technical details of the metod the reader",
    "is referred to our previous two papers @xcite .    in fig .  1 we show the reconstructed potential function obtained using the fitting values of @xmath76 as well as @xmath77 .",

    "exists a systematic method of reducing einstein s field equations to the form of the dynamical system ( [ eq:16 ] ) @xcite .",
    "one of the features of such a representation of dynamics is the possibility of resolving of some cosmological problems like the horizon and flatness problems in terms of the potential function @xmath36 .",
