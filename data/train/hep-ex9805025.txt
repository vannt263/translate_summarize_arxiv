    "in recent years , clear differences between quark and gluon jets have been established experimentally @xcite .",
    "these studies have mostly exploited the large samples of @xmath10  decay events recorded at the cern lep collider , and have examined three - jet events with a symmetric event topology favouring the direct comparison of quark and gluon jets of the same energy produced in the same event topology . in particular ,",
    "gluon jets have been measured to have a larger mean particle multiplicity , a softer fragmentation function and a larger angular width than quark jets of the same energy .",
    "comparisons between jets produced in @xmath56  and @xmath57  collisions also indicate that gluon jets are broader than quark jets @xcite .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the predictions of perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "perturbative qcd makes no explicit predictions for the individual hadron species produced in these jets , but some qcd monte carlo models of hadronization predict that the relative hadron production rates in quark and gluon jets differ for different hadron species .",
    "few experimental results are available on the production of identified particles in quark and gluon jets .",
    "results from @xmath56  annihilations at center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energies around the @xmath58 resonance ( @xmath59  gev ) indicate that baryons are produced about 2.5 times more copiously in direct @xmath58 decays ( @xmath60 ggg @xmath61 hadrons ) than in continuum events ( @xmath62 hadrons ) whilst no such enhancement was observed for mesons @xcite .",
    "an opal investigation  @xcite studied identified particle production in jet topologies enriched in gluon and quark jets and found no jet - dependent differences in the production of mesons and charged particles ( other than protons ) .",
    "in contrast , baryons were found to be produced more copiously in gluon - enriched jet samples .",
    "the delphi collaboration has reported measurements of k@xmath63 , k@xmath64 , p and @xmath1 in secondary - vertex tagged quark and gluon jets in symmetric ( y - shaped ) events @xcite .",
    "within relatively large statistical and systematic uncertainties , they find the ratio of identified particle rates in quark and gluon jets to be consistent with that for charged particles .",
    "recently , l3 has concluded that production of k@xmath64 and @xmath1 in both quark and gluon jets is well modelled by string fragmentation  @xcite .    in this paper an experimental comparison of k@xmath64 and @xmath1 production in quark and gluon jets",
    "is presented .",
    "two complementary analyses of data recorded with the opal detector at lep are presented , using different approaches to identify quark and gluon jets .",
    "one analysis separates quark and gluon jets according to their energies , giving a large sample of events , whilst the other selects a smaller sample of tagged quark and gluon jets in symmetric ( y - shaped ) events , which allows for a simpler interpretation , but with larger uncertainties .    in the first analysis ( the ` energy - based analysis ' )",
    "the production of @xmath0  mesons and @xmath1  baryons  refers to both @xmath1  and @xmath65 . ] in quark and gluon jets was investigated in three - jet events of different topologies selected with the @xmath2  ( durham )  @xcite or a cone  @xcite jet finder .",
    "the jets were ordered by their energy since the lowest energy jets are mainly induced by gluons , and higher energy jets mainly by quarks .",
    "motivated by monte carlo investigations a similar energy dependence for the production rates of all hadron species was assumed , and the production rates of @xmath8  and @xmath1  relative to those of charged particles were determined .",
    "the experimental relative rates were corrected for the underlying mixture of quark and gluon jets , allowing the @xmath0  and @xmath1  relative production rates in pure quark and gluon jets to be obtained .    in the second analysis",
    "( the ` y - event analysis ' ) , a comparison was made of the absolute production rates of @xmath8  mesons and @xmath1  baryons in quark and gluon jets produced under the same conditions , embedded in similar event topologies .",
    "symmetric three - jet events were analysed , where the two lower energy jets ( assumed to be initiated by a quark and a gluon ) were produced at about 150@xmath6  with respect to the higher energy jet .",
    "a sample of anti - tagged gluon jets containing about 30% of the symmetric event sample was isolated by means of a new method of identifying the quark jets based on the observation that light quark jets are more collimated than gluon jets @xcite .",
    "the inclusive yield of charged particles in these jets was also measured , allowing relative rates to be evaluated .",
    "the production rates of the particles in the lower energy jets of the inclusive symmetric sample were determined , and a correction applied in order to obtain measurements corresponding to pure samples of quark and gluon jets .",
    "section  [ detector ] gives a description of the main features of the opal detector , of the data and simulated event samples and of the reconstruction algorithms for @xmath8  and @xmath1 .",
    "section  [ eoanalysis ] describes the details of the energy - based analysis , and section  [ yanalysis ] the y - event analysis .",
    "the results of both analyses are presented and discussed in section [ discuss ] , before the summary is given in section  [ summary ] .",
    "the opal detector is described in detail elsewhere @xcite . of most relevance for the present analyses",
    "are the tracking system and the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "the tracking system consists of a silicon microvertex detector , an inner vertex chamber , a large - volume jet chamber and specialised chambers at the outer radius of the jet chamber which improve the measurements in the @xmath66 direction  is the coordinate parallel to the e@xmath67 beam axis , @xmath68  is the coordinate normal to the beam axis , @xmath69  is the azimuthal angle around the beam axis and @xmath70  is the polar angle ] ( @xmath66-chambers ) .",
    "the tracking system covers the region @xmath71 and is enclosed by a solenoidal magnet coil with an axial field of  0.435  t. the tracking detectors provide momentum measurements of charged particles , and particle identification from measurements of the ionisation energy loss , d@xmath72/d@xmath73 .",
    "electromagnetic energy is measured by a lead - glass calorimeter located outside the magnet coil , which covers @xmath74 .      the energy - based analysis , which is not statistics limited , used 2.8 million events recorded between 1992 and 1994 whilst the y - event analysis used the full opal data sample of about 4.2 million hadronic events collected around the @xmath10  peak from 1990 to 1995 .",
    "the procedures for identifying hadronic events using measurements of tracks and electromagnetic energy are described in  @xcite .",
    "the criteria applied to select tracks and deposits of electromagnetic energy ( clusters ) for the analyses were identical to those in  @xcite . each accepted track and unassociated electromagnetic cluster",
    "was considered to be a particle .",
    "tracks were assigned the pion mass and electromagnetic clusters were assigned zero mass since they originate mostly from photons .    to reduce background from non - hadronic decays of the @xmath10  and to eliminate events in which a significant number of particles were lost near the beam direction , both analyses required that @xmath75 ( @xmath76 is the polar angle of the thrust axis ) ; also , there had to be at least five accepted tracks .",
    "the residual background from all sources was estimated to be less than  1% .",
    "in addition , for the energy - based analysis , events were rejected if they contained tracks with measured momentum greater than 60  @xmath77 , if the absolute value of the vector sum of all selected particles @xmath78 exceeded 30  @xmath77 , or if the visible energy ( the sum of the energies of all the accepted tracks and clusters ) was less than 40% of the center - of - mass energy .",
    "the neutral strange @xmath0  mesons and @xmath1  baryons were reconstructed by their decay channels @xmath0  @xmath79 and @xmath1  @xmath80p . the reconstruction algorithms , signal definitions , efficiency corrections and background subtractions are all described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "briefly , tracks of opposite charge were paired and regarded as a secondary vertex candidate if at least one track pair intersection in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis satisfied the criteria of a neutral two - body decay with the appropriate lifetime . each track pair passing these requirements",
    "was refitted with the constraint that the tracks originated from a common vertex , and background from photon conversions was suppressed . for @xmath1  candidates ,",
    "information from d@xmath72/d@xmath73 measurements was used to help identify the @xmath81 and p for further background suppression .",
    "two sets of cuts are described in @xcite for @xmath1  identification . for the energy - based analysis , @xmath1",
    "candidates were reconstructed using method  1 , which is optimized to have good mass and momentum resolution , while in the y - event analysis the more efficient method  2 was employed to maximize the number of @xmath1  candidates .",
    "candidates for @xmath0  with momentum",
    "greater than 0.150  @xmath77  and with an invariant mass in the range @xmath82 and @xmath1  candidates with momentum greater than 0.520  @xmath77  and with an invariant mass in the range @xmath83 were retained for further analysis .",
    "the @xmath0  rates were determined by fitting the mass spectrum with a third - order polynomial excluding a signal region of @xmath84 around the nominal mass .",
    "the shape of the background under the @xmath1  signal was fitted using a function of the form @xmath85 , excluding a signal window of @xmath86 around the nominal @xmath1  mass . for",
    "each particle species the entries in the signal region were summed and the background as determined by the fit was subtracted .",
    "the efficiency of the identification algorithms was determined as a function of candidate momentum from monte carlo events , and subsequently used to correct the number of observed signal events .    for the energy - based analysis ,",
    "candidates for @xmath1  and @xmath8   were formed and then supplied to the jet finder , whereas this order was reversed in the case of the y - events .",
    "monte carlo studies showed that for the y - event analysis there is no systematic effect due to the order of jet finding and particle reconstruction .",
    "samples of monte carlo hadronic events with a full simulation of the opal detector @xcite and including initial state photon radiation were used to evaluate the detector acceptance and resolution , and to study the efficiency and purity of the quark and gluon jet identification and the particle reconstruction algorithms . in total ,",
    "7 million simulated events were available , of which 4 million were generated by jetset  7.4  @xcite with fragmentation parameters described in  @xcite , and 3 million generated by jetset  7.3 with fragmentation parameters described in  @xcite .",
    "the jetset  7.4 events included updated particle decay tables and heavy meson resonances and were processed using a more recent version of the detector simulation compared to the jetset  7.3 sample .",
    "it should be noted that there are significant differences in the simulation of baryon production between the two jetset  samples .    for comparison with the experimental results ,",
    "the monte carlo models jetset  7.4 and herwig  5.9   decays . ]",
    "@xcite were used .",
    "the models both give a good description of global event shapes and many inclusive particle production rates , but differ in their description of the perturbative phase and their implementation of the hadronization mechanism .",
    "tracks and clusters were selected in the monte carlo events , which include detector simulation , in the same way as for the data : the resulting four - vectors of particles are referred to as being at the ` detector level ' .",
    "alternatively , monte carlo samples without initial - state photon radiation or detector simulation were used , with all charged and neutral particles with mean lifetimes greater than @xmath87  s treated as stable .",
    "the four - vectors of the resulting particles are referred to as being at ` generator level ' .",
    "the remaining quarks and gluons after the termination of the parton shower in these events are referred to as being at the ` parton level ' .",
    "two different types of algorithms are commonly used for jet definition : recombination jet finders and cone jet finders .",
    "the treatment of high momentum particles which lie close to the jet axes is similar for both types of jet finder , but there are substantial differences in the assignment to the jets of soft particles far from the jet axes .",
    "recombination algorithms combine all particles into jets , whereas cone finders do not associate particles outside the cones .",
    "the recombination jet finders iteratively combine pairs of particles until the scaled resolution parameter ( @xmath88 ) of all subsequent pairings exceeds the jet resolution parameter @xmath3 . the cone jet finder associates particles into jets that lie within a cone of fixed half - angle @xmath89 .",
    "the cone axis is determined from the vector sum of the momenta of the particles contained therein .    to illustrate the sensitivity of the analysis to event topology and jet reconstruction algorithm , we selected three samples of three - jet events with different average topologies , using either the @xmath2   jet finding algorithm  @xcite , or the cone algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the main selection , containing the largest number of three - jet events , was obtained using the @xmath2  algorithm with a resolution parameter , @xmath3  = 0.005 .",
    "the second sample of three - jet events ( @xmath90  sample ) was selected from a window of @xmath88-values between 0.008 and 0.016 , i.e. , the event should be classified as three - jet for some value of @xmath3  within this window .",
    "monte carlo studies at the generator and parton level showed that hadronization effects on the angles of jets selected in this sample are small .",
    "the average resolution parameter @xmath3  for these events to be clustered into three jets was about 0.01 .",
    "finally , a third sample of three - jet events was selected using the cone jet finder with the parameters @xmath89 = 0.7  rad and @xmath91 = 7  gev , where @xmath91 is the minimum energy contained in the jet cone .",
    "these parameters were chosen to give a good correspondence between jets reconstructed at the generator and parton levels in monte carlo events @xcite .",
    "both jet finding algorithms were applied using reconstructed @xmath0  and @xmath1   candidates , accepted charged tracks ( excluding the decay products of @xmath0  and @xmath1 ) and the electromagnetic clusters not associated to tracks .",
    "additional quality cuts were then applied to the selected three - jet events .",
    "each jet was required to contain at least two charged tracks , to have more than 5 gev of visible energy and to lie in the polar region @xmath92  0.9 .",
    "the sum of the angles between all three jets had to exceed @xmath93 to eliminate non - planar events , and the angle between the two lower energy jets was required to be larger than @xmath94 .",
    "finally , the jets in each event were each assigned a calculated energy based on the measured jet directions and assuming massless kinematics .",
    "after all cuts , @xmath95 of events were selected by the @xmath3   selection , @xmath96 by the @xmath90  selection , and @xmath97 by the cone selection .",
    "the tighter selection criteria for the @xmath90  and the cone samples , yielding a lower number of three - jet events , were partly compensated by an improved reconstruction quality e.g. , a better agreement of the jets at the parton and generator level . in total , samples of about 500,000 three - jet events were retained for further analysis . in figure  [ fig_b1 ] the energy spectra of the jets in the @xmath3  sample is shown .",
    "the jet energy distributions are more peaked in the @xmath3  selection compared to the @xmath90  and cone selections .",
    "the relatively small number of events containing a jet with energy below 7.5  gev ( @xmath98 ) were excluded from further analysis .    in general , the angular separation of the jets ( jet topology ) ,",
    "is dependent on the event selection .",
    "in particular , the @xmath3  selection gave the most collimated sample of events , with an average angle between the two lowest energy jets of about 62@xmath6 .",
    "this can be compared to average angles of about 70@xmath6  for the @xmath90  sample and about 76@xmath6  for the cone selection .",
    "since the jets selected in any given energy interval were a mixture of quark and gluon jets , jetset  monte carlo events were used to determine the quark and gluon jet content of the samples in the following manner .",
    "the monte carlo events were selected in the same way as the data events and were accepted if classified as three - jet events at detector level . from the partons of these events",
    "exactly three jets were reconstructed .",
    "the detector level jets closest in angle to the parton level jets containing the primary quark and anti - quark were considered to be the quark jets and the remaining jet the gluon jet .",
    "the term quark ( gluon ) ` jet purity ' is defined to be the fraction of jets in a given energy bin , initiated by quarks ( gluons ) .",
    "the purities of the jets as a function of jet energy are shown in figure  [ fig_b2 ] .",
    "the lowest energy jet samples contained in excess of 85% gluons , whereas the high energy samples were composed of over 95% quark jets .",
    "the purity distributions as a function of jet energy determined with the @xmath2  algorithm in the @xmath3  and @xmath90  samples agree to within 1% .",
    "the gluon jet purity in the cone sample was lower than that of the @xmath3  and @xmath90  samples by a few percent in very low and in high energy jets .",
    "the herwig  monte carlo model and jetset  in matrix element mode @xcite predict similar jet purities to the standard jetset  samples , and detector effects on the purity distribution were found to be small .      with the @xmath3  selection , about 100,000 @xmath8  and about 30,000 @xmath1",
    "were reconstructed .",
    "the production rates per jet of charged particles , @xmath0  mesons and @xmath1  baryons in jets , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , are shown as functions of the jet energy in figure  [ fig_b3 ] after corrections for reconstruction efficiency ( about 16% ) and detector acceptance .",
    "the decay products of @xmath0  and @xmath1  were not counted as charged particles .",
    "the predictions of the jetset  7.4 and herwig  5.9 monte carlo models are also shown in figure  [ fig_b3 ] . whereas the jetset  7.4 generator describes the experimental data fairly well",
    ", the predictions of herwig  5.9 agree poorly with the data .",
    "similar results were obtained with the three - jet events from the @xmath90  and the cone selections .",
    "the particle production rates rise with the jet energy partly due to the changing mixture of gluon and quark jets , and partly due to the increased energy available for particle production . in order to measure differences due to quark and gluon jets ,",
    "it is necessary to remove this jet energy dependence .",
    "if a similar energy dependence for the production rates of all hadron species is assumed , then the relative particle production rate ( defined as the rate of @xmath8  or @xmath1  production divided by the rate of charged particle production , @xmath102 and @xmath103 ) would be independent of the jet energy .",
    "studies of jetset   events showed that there is indeed only a weak energy dependence of these relative production rates in pure quark and gluon jets , figure  [ fig_relrates ] .",
    "the lines are fits of straight lines and have slopes smaller than @xmath104 . for gluon jets the slopes are smaller than for quark jets , and for @xmath0  smaller than for @xmath1 .",
    "as jetset  gives a good overall description of the data over a large range of c.m . and",
    "jet energies , it was assumed for further analysis that the relative particle production rates are constant in the data and we choose this assumption to reduce the dependence on monte carlo models . the consistency of the results with this assumption will be shown later .",
    "particle production in jets depends not only on the jet energy but also on the proximity of the other jets in the event@xcite .",
    "further monte carlo studies showed that this angular dependence is almost the same for all hadron species and does not affect the relative rates .",
    "the relative particle production rates of @xmath8  and @xmath1  were computed in each jet energy interval from the ratios of the rates shown in figure  [ fig_b3 ] .",
    "the relative rates for pure quark and gluon jets were unfolded using the jet purities for each three - jet event   sample , obtained from monte carlo results shown in figure  [ fig_b2 ] .",
    "a fit was performed to the observed relative rates as a function of jet energy @xmath105 using the function : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the measured relative particle rate , @xmath108 the gluon purity of the jets , and @xmath109 and @xmath110 the relative rates in pure quark and gluon jets , with @xmath111(@xmath112 = hadron ) . @xmath109 and",
    "@xmath110 were assumed to be constant for the reasons stated above .",
    "the fit was performed in the jet energy range from 7.5  gev to 45.0  gev .",
    "the relative particle rates as a function of the jet energy are shown in figure  [ fig_b4 ] for the @xmath3  selection , with the lines giving the fit results .",
    "the fit results and @xmath113/d.o.f .",
    "values for all three selections are given in table  [ table_eoresults ] . in order to compare particle production in quark and gluon jets ,",
    "the ratios @xmath114 and @xmath115 were studied .",
    "these are given in table  [ tab_b3 ] and will be discussed fully in section  [ discuss ] .",
    "the following sources of systematic uncertainty on the measured ratios of relative rates have been studied . for each source of uncertainty ,",
    "the difference with respect to the standard analysis was used to estimate a symmetric systematic uncertainty .",
    "the uncertainties listed in table  [ tab_b2 ] were added in quadrature to arrive at a total systematic error .",
    "three - jet event reconstruction : : :    the analysis was repeated with the following changes :    +    * charged tracks only were used for the reconstruction of jets ,    instead of charged tracks and unassociated electromagnetic clusters .    this check disregards all calorimeter information when determining    energy flows in the events , so the changes represent an extreme    situation . a systematic error was therefore determined from the    difference divided by @xmath116 ;    * the resolution parameter of the @xmath2  jet - finder    was varied by replacing the @xmath3  = 0.005    selection by selecting three - jet events in a window of y - values    ( 0.004 , 0.008 ) .",
    "the @xmath90  selection was    modified by requiring a cut at a fixed value ,    @xmath117 .",
    "@xmath1  and @xmath8  reconstruction : : :    as in @xcite and @xcite the major sources of systematic    uncertainties for the reconstruction of    @xmath0  and @xmath1  were found    to be the background determination and the reliability of the monte    carlo simulation for distributions on which cuts were placed .",
    "+    * the @xmath8  and @xmath1  selection    criteria were varied as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , the cut    on the distance between the reconstructed secondary vertex and the    first measured hit of the decay particles was loosened from 3  to 9  cm ;    * a sideband method  @xcite was applied to determine the backgrounds    under the @xmath0  and    @xmath1  signals ; and    * systematic uncertainties on the strange particle reconstruction    efficiencies were estimated by calculating the efficiencies separately    using the jetset  7.3 and jetset  7.4 samples ( the standard analysis    used the combined jetset  7.3 and 7.4 samples ) . the simulation of    baryon production differs considerably in these samples and they were    taken to represent alternative possibilities of generator tuning and    detector simulation .",
    "studies of events generated using herwig  as input    to the detector simulation gave efficiencies lying in the range    spanned by jetset  7.3 and jetset  7.4 .",
    "a symmetric systematic    uncertainty was assigned using the full difference between jetset  7.3    and jetset  7.4 divided by @xmath118 .",
    "quark and gluon jet unfolding : : :    the systematic uncertainties in the determination of    @xmath0  and @xmath1  production    in quark and gluon jets were obtained by the following variations :    +    * the upper and lower bounds of the fit range    ( @xmath119 gev ) were changed to 12.5 and 40  gev    respectively ;    * the influence of the jet purity determination was studied by varying    the purities by their systematic uncertainties ( about 5% ) , which were    derived as described in  @xcite .",
    "briefly , the uncertainty in the    identification of quark and gluon jets was estimated by comparing    different fragmentation models ( jetset  and herwig ) and studying    detector resolution effects ;    * as a check of the fit procedure , the relative production rates in    pure gluon jets were obtained by a linear fit to the relative rates    @xmath120 ) as a function of the gluon jet purity    @xmath121 above @xmath122 8% , and    extrapolating to 100% gluon jet purity ;    * the fit function was modified to account for a possible linear    energy dependence of the relative particle production rates in pure    quark and gluon jets , using the jetset  slopes as shown in    figure  [ fig_relrates ] .",
    "it can be seen from table  [ tab_b2 ] that    considering non - zero values of the slopes results in only a small    contribution to the systematic uncertainties .",
    "this means that the    relative rates found in the experimental data are consistent with the    assumption of independence of the jet energy .",
    "the main contributions to the systematic uncertainties came from the variation of the cuts on @xmath0  and @xmath1  candidates , from the differences in detection efficiencies determined using jetset  7.3 and jetset  7.4 , and from the variation of the fit ranges .",
    "the ratios of relative rates determined from the fit were essentially unchanged if contributions from @xmath0  and @xmath1  decay products were included in the charged particle rates .    finally , monte carlo events with full detector simulation were analysed in the same manner as the data .",
    "the relative rates derived from the fits ( 0.95@xmath1230.02 for @xmath8  and 1.27@xmath1230.04 for @xmath1 ) were compared with those determined directly at the generator level in these events ( 0.94 and 1.26 respectively ) .",
    "the agreement for both @xmath1  and @xmath0  from the @xmath3  sample is good .",
    "the results from the other two jet samples agreed equally well .",
    "for the y - event analysis , jets were defined with the cone jet finding algorithm , supplying all accepted particles as input .",
    "the resolution parameters chosen for the jet finder were a cone size @xmath124 , as in an earlier publication  @xcite , and a minimum jet energy @xmath91  computed once for each event according to @xmath125  gev where @xmath126  is the c.m .",
    "energy and @xmath127  the sum of the energy of the particles .",
    "the criteria given in references  @xcite were followed to select a sample of symmetric three - jet events .",
    "each jet was required to contain at least two particles and to lie in the polar angle region @xmath128 , and the sum of the angles between the three jets was required to exceed @xmath129 . as in the energy - based approach ,",
    "the jets in each event were assigned a calculated energy based on the interjet angles , assuming massless kinematics .",
    "strongly symmetric three - jet events were selected by projecting the jets into the three - jet event plane and requiring the angles between the jet with the highest calculated energy and each of the two others to be in the range @xmath130 .",
    "the event plane is defined as the plane perpendicular to the sphericity @xcite eigenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue . in total , 70,738 symmetric three - jet events were found .",
    "the mean calculated jet energies were @xmath131  gev for the highest energy jet and @xmath132  gev for the two lower energy jets .",
    "the highest energy jets are likely to be quark jets with high probability , due to the nature of the gluon radiation spectrum . from a monte carlo study , this probability was estimated to be 97.3% .",
    "the two lower energy jets were therefore assumed to be a quark jet and a gluon jet of equal energy with the same angles with respect to the other two jets in the event . the inclusive sample of lower energy jets is referred to as the ` normal - mixture ' sample of jets .",
    "a gluon - jet enriched sample of the lower energy jets was selected by a new variant of the method @xcite of identifying quark jets in order to ` anti - tag ' the gluon jets .",
    "for each lower energy jet identified as a quark jet , the other lower energy jet was assumed to be a gluon jet .",
    "this anti - tagged sample of gluon jets was therefore essentially unbiased by the tagging method .",
    "it contained a well known fraction of gluon jets established from studies of simulated events .",
    "previous studies employed the reconstruction of secondary vertices or the identification of energetic leptons to identify jets that originated from heavy quarks . whilst this yielded an anti - tagged jet sample with a gluon purity typically in excess of 90% ,",
    "the efficiency to identify quark jets was only of order 5% .",
    "the present analysis introduces a new method to isolate a large sample of quark jets by identifying jets that are collimated , i.e. that have a large fraction of their energy close to the jet axis .",
    "studies of quark and gluon jets in symmetric events have shown that gluon jets are broader than quark jets  @xcite and this is well reproduced by monte carlo models .",
    "in particular , the quantity @xmath133  is determined , which is given by the fraction of the jet s energy contained in a cone co - axial with the jet axis and with half - angle @xmath134 .",
    "if the energy of the particles contained in the sub - cone is @xmath135 and the visible jet energy is @xmath136 then @xmath137 .",
    "the @xmath133  distributions were studied in detector level monte carlo events .",
    "three - jet events were selected as above , and @xmath133   determined for the two lower energy jets .",
    "each simulated hadron jet was associated with an underlying quark or gluon jet using the method described in  @xcite .",
    "briefly , the two hadron jets that were closest in angle to the directions of the primary quark and anti - quark which had evolved from the @xmath10  decay were considered to be the quark jets , and the remaining jet was identified as the gluon jet .",
    "figure  [ fthet ] shows the distributions of @xmath133  for @xmath138 for jets in the simulated events that were classified as quark or gluon jets .",
    "the quark jets tend to have larger @xmath133  values than the gluon jets , and a sample of jets with a high quark content can therefore be selected by requiring @xmath133  to exceed some threshold @xmath139 ,  for example @xmath140 .",
    "the anti - tagged jet purity @xmath141  is defined to be the fraction of anti - tagged jets that are indeed associated with an underlying gluon jet , and the tagging rate , @xmath142 , is defined to be the fraction of normal - mixture y - events which contain jets that are anti - tagged . from monte carlo studies , the normal - mixture sample of jets had a gluon content , @xmath143% .",
    "the anti - tagged jet purity and the tag rate depend on the values of @xmath134 and @xmath139 , and values of @xmath141  of up to about 80% can be achieved whilst maintaining a tag rate in excess of about 30% . a high gluon purity is desirable for the algebraic correction procedure later , and therefore @xmath144 and @xmath140 were chosen for the standard tag . from studies of monte carlo events",
    "the values @xmath145 and @xmath146 were determined , where the first error is statistical and the second systematic .",
    "the systematic error includes contributions from the choice of monte carlo model ( jetset  7.4 , jetset  7.3 or herwig  5.9 ) and the method used to identify the quark jet in the simulated events ( the method described in section  [ purities ] for the energy - based analysis was used as an alternative ) . in the data , @xmath144 and @xmath140 gave a tag rate of @xmath147 ( 23,256 anti - tagged jets ) which is well described by the simulated events .",
    "the average energy of the anti - tagged jets was @xmath148  gev .",
    "in about @xmath149 of events both of the lower energy jets fulfilled the tag criteria due to misidentification of collimated gluon jets ( the highest energy jet is the gluon in fewer than 10% of these cases ) , and therefore in these events both the lower energy jets were included in the anti - tagged gluon jet sample .",
    "the double tag rate rose to about @xmath150 for @xmath151 and @xmath140 .",
    "the flavour composition of the tagged , anti - tagged and normal - mixture jets in the monte carlo events is shown in table  [ tag_flavour ] .",
    "significantly fewer b - flavour jets were tagged than light - flavour jets which is consistent with the observation that b quark jets in @xmath10   decays are broader than light quark jets @xcite ; a small reduction is also visible in the rate of tagging c - flavour jets .",
    "the light quark flavour composition of the tagged jets reflects the relative couplings of u- and d - type quarks to the @xmath10 .",
    "there is a fairly good correspondence between the quark flavour properties of the normal - mixture and anti - tagged jet samples .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that there is no significant systematic bias to the measurements of quark and gluon jet differences from the flavour composition of the anti - tagged jets .",
    "the flavour composition of the quark jets in the anti - tagged sample is therefore not expected to give a systematic bias in the present analysis .",
    "@xmath8  mesons and @xmath1  baryons were reconstructed as described in section  [ lamk0s ] .",
    "their invariant mass spectra were computed in bins of momentum , @xmath152  and @xmath153 , within the normal - mixture and anti - tagged jets separately .",
    "a @xmath8  or a @xmath1  candidate was assigned to a jet if its momentum vector fell within the cone defining the jet , i.e. , if it lay less than 30@xmath6  from the jet axis .",
    "if a @xmath8  or @xmath1  was within 30@xmath6  of both jets , it was assigned to the higher ( calculated ) energy jet .",
    "the detection efficiencies of the @xmath8  and @xmath1  finding algorithms were sensitive to the particle momenta and to the track environment , and were therefore determined from simulated events for each bin of @xmath152  and @xmath153  within the normal - mixture and anti - tagged jets separately .",
    "the efficiency was computed from the fraction of generated @xmath8  or @xmath1  within a jet that were found in the same jet by the algorithm .",
    "the background - subtracted numbers of @xmath8   and @xmath1  were corrected for detection efficiency as a function of momentum , and summed to give the production rates of @xmath8  and @xmath1   in normal - mixture and anti - tagged jets , @xmath154 and @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 .      the algebraic method introduced in  @xcite",
    "was used to correct for quark and gluon misidentification and to arrive at the ratio of the identified particle production rates for pure quark and gluon jets .    the production rate of particle type @xmath158 in the normal - mixture sample of jets , @xmath159 may be written @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the production rates of @xmath158 in pure gluon and quark jets respectively .",
    "similarly , the production rate in the anti - tagged sample @xmath163 may be written @xmath164    the ratio of the production rates for pure gluon and quark jets @xmath165may therefore be determined by @xmath166    as in the case of the multiplicity measurement in  @xcite it was assumed for the purposes of the algebraic correction that @xmath162 and @xmath161 are the same in equations [ dnmix ] and [ dtag ] .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption , as the quark flavour compositions of the normal - mixture and anti - tagged samples are generally consistent , and as the properties of energetic acolinear gluons are independent of event flavour according to qcd .",
    "the simulated events provide a good representation of the relevant event properties such as the collimation of jets .",
    "therefore any residual effects are expected to be removed by the corrections for detector effects .",
    "the measured production rates @xmath167 appear in equation  [ algebraic ] as the ratio @xmath168 and therefore some systematic effects related to particle identification are expected to cancel .",
    "statistical uncertainties on @xmath165  were estimated from the variance of the results obtained when the analysis was repeated ten times with the data split into independent subsets .",
    "this procedure correctly takes into account correlations between @xmath163 and @xmath159 .      a correction derived from monte carlo events",
    "was applied to correct for detector acceptance and resolution .",
    "the correction was formed from the ratio of @xmath165  values determined at the generator and detector levels . at the generator level ,",
    "the same three - jet event selection criteria as for the data were applied ( with the exception of the requirement @xmath128 for the jet axes ) .",
    "monte carlo information was used to identify quark and gluon jets , as well as particle type .",
    "the detector corrections were determined to be @xmath169 for charged particles , @xmath170 for @xmath8  and @xmath171 for @xmath1  with uncertainties due to the limited statistics of the monte carlo samples .",
    "the correction factor for charged particles agrees well with that determined in @xcite .",
    "the final results can be found in table  [ t_summary ] which will be discussed later .",
    "systematic uncertainties , which are listed in table  [ t_syst ] , were evaluated from a number of sources in a similar fashion to the energy - based analysis described in section  [ systematics ] .",
    "the total systematic errors were obtained by combining the individual contributions in quadrature .",
    "detector effects : : :    the total energy and momentum flow in the event were estimated using    charged tracks only instead of tracks and electromagnetic clusters .    these were used as input to the jet finding and quark jet    identification algorithms and the analysis was repeated .",
    "the observed    jets are more collimated when measured using tracking information    only .",
    "this is reproduced by the monte carlo , both at the generator and    detector levels and is partly due to decays of @xmath172    into photons which tend to broaden the flow of neutral particles in    the jet .",
    "the effect of this increased collimation was that the    anti - tagged jet purities and tag rates were somewhat different to the    standard case , with    @xmath173% and    @xmath174%    for @xmath144 and    @xmath175 .",
    "the uncertainty was estimated from the difference divided    by @xmath176 as for the energy - based analysis above .",
    "quark jet identification : : :    the analysis was repeated using parameters    @xmath151 and    @xmath140 since    its tagging rate    ( @xmath177 ) ,    and the anti - tagged jet purity    ( @xmath178 )    were somewhat different compared to the standard analysis . event selection : : :    events were selected requiring a minimum jet energy of 10  gev which is    the selection criterion used in  @xcite .",
    "jet purity determination : : :    a number of sources of systematic uncertainty on    @xmath141  have been considered .",
    "simulated events    from the jetset  7.4 and jetset  7.3 samples were used separately to    determine the purities and tag rates , and the observed differences    were used to evaluate an uncertainty related to the event generator    tuning and detector simulation .",
    "a further uncertainty comes from the    ambiguity in defining whether a jet arises from a quark or a gluon , as    described in a previous opal publication @xcite .",
    "the same procedures    were followed to determine a systematic error which was added in    quadrature with the other sources to arrive at the total systematic    uncertainty .",
    "the analysis was repeated using the tagged and    normal - mixture jet purity values varied by their combined statistical    and systematic uncertainties .",
    "background determination : : :    the fit ranges , signal window sizes and excluded regions were all    varied to determine the background to the selected    @xmath8  and @xmath1  signals . in the    case of the @xmath1",
    "an alternative function was also    used to describe the background .",
    "finally a sideband method was used to    determine the background .",
    "efficiency determination : : :    the jetset  7.3 and jetset  7.4 samples of simulated events were used    separately to estimate the efficiency of the    @xmath8  and @xmath1  finding    algorithms .",
    "the two monte carlo samples are taken to represent    alternative possibilities of generator tuning and detector simulation    and an uncertainty was estimated as for the energy - based analysis    above .",
    "several of the systematic variations were made simultaneously ,    and in no case was a difference larger than that for jetset  7.3    observed .",
    "monte carlo statistics : : :    the finite numbers of simulated events available led to statistical    uncertainties in the particle detection efficiencies , and the detector    corrections .",
    "the effect of varying the cone size @xmath89 that defines the jets has been investigated in  @xcite where an increase in @xmath179  with @xmath89 was observed .",
    "other sources of uncertainty such as changing the requirement on the angle between the highest energy and the other jets , and modifying the track and cluster selection criteria have been considered in that publication and found to be negligible .",
    "there were also no statistically significant differences between the detector acceptance corrections computed with the jetset  7.3 or jetset  7.4 samples .",
    "[ eoresults ]    the results of the energy - based analysis are given in table  [ tab_b3 ] .",
    "the ratios @xmath180 and @xmath181 of relative @xmath0  and @xmath1  production rates in pure gluon and quark jets are given for all three event selections , together with their statistical and systematic uncertainties and the predictions of the jetset  7.4 model .",
    "for the @xmath3  selection , the production of @xmath0  mesons is enhanced in gluon jets relative to quark jets by a factor @xmath4 where the first error is statistical and the second systematic .",
    "similar results were obtained with the other event selections .",
    "the relative production rate of @xmath1  baryons was found to be increased in gluon jets relative to quark jets by @xmath182 in the @xmath3  selection .",
    "the less collimated @xmath90   and cone event samples show a smaller increase in the relative production rates of @xmath1  baryons indicating a possible dependence of the baryon production rates on the topology of the events . for the y - event analysis , the ratios of absolute production rates of @xmath8  and @xmath1  in 24  gev gluon and quark jets were found to be @xmath183 and @xmath184 for jets defined with the cone algorithm using a cone size of 30@xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding result for charged particles is @xmath185 which is in good agreement with the result from the previous opal vertex - tagged analysis ( @xmath4 @xcite ) and which has a reduced statistical error as a result of the use of the more efficient energy flow tag .",
    "the measurements in the y - event analysis may also be used to determine production rates of @xmath8  and @xmath1  in quark and gluon jets relative to those of charged particles .",
    "the relative rates of @xmath8  and @xmath1  production are @xmath186 and @xmath187 , where correlations between the sources of systematic uncertainty ( given in table  [ t_syst ] ) have been taken into account .",
    "an enhancement of @xmath1  production in gluon jets relative to quark jets , in excess of that observed for charged particles , is measured by both analyses , with the ratios of the relative @xmath1  rates consistent within the errors .",
    "the ratios of the relative production rates of @xmath8  mesons in gluon and quark jets are also compatible within the errors , and suggest a small enhancement relative to charged particles .",
    "the analyses presented here are consistent with previous findings @xcite that have shown that factors such as jet finder , jet energy and event topology are important in quantifying the differences between quark and gluon jets .",
    "therefore , care should be taken to ensure that the conditions are equivalent when comparing results between experiments .",

    "herwig  5.9 , despite its good description of global event properties , fails to give an adequate description of the measurements of ratios of strange particle production rates in quark and gluon jets .",
    "this result is not surprising given the poor description of the inclusive strange particle rates as a function of jet energy shown in figure  [ fig_b3 ] .",
    "jetset  7.4 , however , was shown to provide a reasonable general description of the data in figure  [ fig_b3 ] , and the ratios of relative rates from the y - event sample are consistent with its predictions for both @xmath8  and @xmath1",
    ". the ratios of relative rates from the energy - based analysis , however , are significantly larger than those predicted for both @xmath8  and @xmath1 .",
    "the predictions of the ratios of relative production rates from jetset  7.3 differ from jetset  7.4 by at most 0.04 which gives an indication of the size of possible effects due to parameter tuning and inclusion of additional particle decay channels .",
    "there is no perturbative mechanism in the jetset  model that gives rise to the observed differences in particle production between quark and gluon jets ; they arise from the effects of hadronization and particle decays .",
    "many of the @xmath8  are the decay products of heavy ( b and c flavour ) hadrons . as the production of b and c quarks in gluon jets",
    "is suppressed , there are correspondingly fewer @xmath8  in these jets .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath1  production ( and of baryons in general ) in gluon jets relative to quark jets predicted by jetset  is a consequence of the different dynamics of the string fragmentation process in quark and gluon jets .",
    "production rates for @xmath0  and @xmath1  have been measured in quark and gluon jets from @xmath10  decays with two complementary approaches . in the first analysis a procedure was introduced to compare particle production in gluon and quark jets of different energies facilitating the study of up to about @xmath188% of the total event sample .",
    "different jet finding algorithms ( @xmath2 , cone ) were used to investigate samples with different three - jet event topologies .",
    "relative rates , normalized to the inclusive charged particle rate , were obtained for pure quark and gluon jets considering the different quark and gluon content of jets in different energy intervals .",
    "the relative rates in pure gluon and quark jets were found to be consistent with being independent of the jet energies , and to depend slightly on the specific jet selection .    in the second analysis",
    "a new method was introduced to tag quark jets based on the collimation of their energy flow , allowing the isolation of a larger sample of anti - tagged gluon jets in symmetric three - jet events than the method of secondary vertex tagging used previously .",
    "the comparison of quark and gluon jets of equal energies and embedded in almost identical event environments allows for a simple interpretation of the results .",
    "the jets were selected using a cone algorithm . by also measuring the inclusive particle rates in these symmetric jets ,",
    "relative rates were obtained in addition to the absolute rates .",
    "an enhancement of @xmath1  production in gluon jets relative to quark jets , in excess of that for charged particles is observed .",

    "the results of both analyses are compatible within their errors .",
