    "in the previous papers of these series @xcite we investigated response properties of quantised fields .",
    "analyses in those papers were , so to speak , pure kinematics . starting from this paper we extend our analyses to dynamics . here",
    "we derive the formal tool on which other dynamical results depend , and which we term the _ causal wick theorem_. the latter is a functional ( hori s ) @xcite form of _ wick s theorem _",
    "@xcite in the schwinger - perel - keldysh _ closed - time - loop formalism _ @xcite , written in terms of the _ linear response function _ @xcite characteristic of the field in question .",
    "the term _ causal wick theorem _ was introduced in the unpublished paper @xcite .    in the standard feynman - dyson technique of quantum field theory @xcite ,",
    "wick s theorem supplies dynamical information about free fields , expressed by their _ contractions _ , or",
    "_ feynman propagators _",
    "( we avoid the term _ causal green function _ , because we associate `` causal '' with `` retarded , '' as in _ causal response _ and _ causal space - time evolution _ ) . in the closed - time - loop formalism , propagators becomes matrices , but the fact that wick s theorem is a supplier of dynamical information contained in propagators does not change .    as was shown in",
    "( see also @xcite ) , components of the perel - keldysh matrix propagator may be expressed by the linear response function ( known in quantum field theory as the retarded green function @xcite ) characteristic of the field . as a physical quantity",
    ", this function emerges in kubo s linear response theory @xcite for the field in question , see and sections [ ch : tf ] and [ ch : or ] of this paper .",
    "linear response of the free electromagnetic field was considered by schwinger @xcite .",
    "the only information about the field needed for wick s theorem is its response .",
    "thus the formal operation of operator reordering which is the subject of wick s theorem is inherently connected to how the field propagates in space - time .",
    "one may say that propagation of the field is the actual physical content of wick s theorem .",
    "the causal wick theorem makes this evident .",
    "an immediate word of caution is in place here . in the literature , the term _",
    "wick s theorem _ is used for two different facts .",
    "wick s original theorem expresses time - ordered products of free - field _",
    "operators _ as linear combinations of normally - ordered products of the same operators .",
    "this theorem holds irrespective of the quantum state of the system and _ ipso facto _ may be used for systems out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "the other meaning of this term is a gaussian factorisation of _ green functions _ of free fields in thermal equilibrium ( underlying , e.g. , the matsubara diagram techniques @xcite ) .",
    "phase - space methods may be applied to quantum dynamics in both cases , cf .   and @xcite , respectively .",
    "this particular paper is part of the effort directed at extending the out - of - equilibrium methods of to space - time evolution of arbitrary interacting quantum fields , cf .",
    "the introduction to our paper @xcite .",
    "the question of how far the equilibrium phase - space techniques of may be generalised is outside the scope of this paper ( and very much outside the scope of this series of papers ) .",
    "consequently , here the term _ wick s theorem _ is used strictly in the sense of a relation between time - ordered and normally - ordered operator products . had the need arisen to emphasise the said distinction , we shall talk about _",
    "wick s theorem for operators_.    this paper is self - contained and does not directly rely on our previous work .",
    "a brief overview of papers @xcite seems nonetheless beneficial for putting this one in perspective . in",
    "we demonstrated a structural equivalence of response properties of stochastic c - number and quantised fields .",
    "it applies without reservation to an arbitrary bosonic field , whether real or complex , free or interacting , in or out of equilibrium . at the cost of exploiting essentially nonclassical objects , such as grassmann sources @xcite",
    ", it extends also to fermionic fields . the technical tool making this equivalence evident is _ response transformation _",
    "@xcite , cf .",
    "also @xcite .",
    "formally , it is a change of variables ( termed _ response substitution _ ) in the generating functionals of quantum averages of products of heisenberg  field operators ordered in the closed - time - loop style . in @xcite , a similar substitution",
    "was termed a change to _",
    "causal variables_. in this paper we use both terms : response substitutions introduce causal variables .    in @xcite ,",
    "causal variables were identified for the harmonic oscillator , and then postulated for interacting fields .",
    "papers @xcite were concerned with consistency of such generalisation .",
    "it was shown that formal quantum response structures , which emerge as a result of the response transformation , coincide with typical response structures characteristic of stochastic c - number fields .",
    "in particular , classical reality and causality properties were shown to hold , exactly and without reservation , for quantised fields .",
    "the result of this and forthcoming papers in a nutshell is that _ formal _ response structures identified in @xcite , firstly , naturally extend to underlying quantum dynamics , and , secondly , under _ macroscopic _ ( also called mesoscopic @xcite ) conditions turn into _ physical _ response structures .",
    "the causal wick theorem allows one to rewrite dyson s standard perturbative approach of quantum field theory directly in the response representation .",
    "similarly to how response transformations reveal the kinematical response properties of quantised fields , the causal wick theorem reveals the dynamical response properties hidden in quantum equations of motion . for examples",
    "the causal wick theorem may be seen as a step towards dispelling the myth about inconsistency of space - time evolution with relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "the reason why the feynman - dyson type of approaches do not allow one to describe propagation of quantum fields in space and time is purely technical : they do not operate with sufficient number of green functions .",
    "this becomes obvious already if looking at pair green functions . in the feynman - dyson techniques ,",
    "there exists only one pair green function per field  the dressed feynman propagator . that this is not enough is obvious from a classical analogy . for a classical stochactic field",
    ", we have two pair quantities : the linear response function and the average of a product of two fields . in the quantum response viewpoint ,",
    "the corresponding quantities are kubo s linear response function @xcite and the time - normal average of a pair of operators @xcite .",
    "one dressed feynman propagator can not be equivalent to two independent quantities .    in the schwinger - perel - keldysh closed - time - loop formalism @xcite , the number of independent pair green functions doubles .",
    "consequently , this formalism and the response representation are connected by a one - to - one transformation .",
    "this is all that response tranformations are about .",
    "neither these transformations nor the causal wick theorem may be introduced in the feynman - dyson techniques .",
    "both are strictly subject to the closed - time - loop framework .",
    "we stress once again that we are talking about arbitrary nonequilibrium systems where fluctiations and response are not generally related to each other . in vacuum the time - normal average vanishes , while in equilibrium it is related to response by kubo s fluctuation - dissipation theorem . in both cases",
    "one enjoys the luxury of having only one independent pair green function to work with .",
    "this underlies success of the standard feynman - dyson techniques , and of the so - called retarded - advanced formalism @xcite , concerned with field propagation in interacting thermal systems @xcite .",
    "our results , we repeat , apply to arbitrary nonequilibrium systems , where the said luxury is unavailable .    we make extensive use of the functional ( hori s ) form of wick s theorem @xcite ( the hori - wick theorem , for short ) . outside the quantum - field - theoretical community , wick s theorem",
    "is often regarded as something high - minded , and its functional form as high - minded in the extreme .",
    "in fact , the hori - wick theorem is a major simplification .",
    "firstly , it is an excellent mnemonic tool .",
    "its algebraic rigidity leaves one only with the freedom of formulae for contractions .",
    "these are worked out applying wick s theorem to pair products , which is next to trivial ( cf .",
    "sections [ ch : om ] and [ ch : w ] ) .",
    "secondly , it reduces complicated calculations to straighforward algebra ( cf .",
    "sections [ ch : of ] and [ ch : ct ] ) .",
    "last but not least , the hori - wick theorem greatly simplifies extention of the formal techniques to fermions . by making use of auxiliary grassmann variables @xcite , sign rules characteristic of wick s theorem for fermions are observed automatically , and the algebra remains mostly as for bosons .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we start from deriving the causal wick theorem for the harmonic oscillator in section [ ch : o ] . in section [ ch : h ] we extend it to the real ( hermitian ) field . in both cases , results of form a coherent background for analyses in this paper .",
    "unlike the real field , formulae we need for complex fields are absent in @xcite . filling this gap is the subject of section [ ch : t ] , which is a sizeable fraction of the formal effort in the paper .",
    "the causal wick theorem for complex bosonic and fermionic fields is derived in section [ ch : s ] . in section [ ch : n ] we outline simplifications characteristic of the nonrelativistic  ( resonance , rotating wave ) approximation .",
    "appendices take care of formal particulars brushed under the carpet in the main body of the paper .",
    "they also outline details of derivations making the paper self - contained . of independent interest to the reader",
    "may be appendices [ ch : dgf ] and [ ch : b ] which deal with the mathematical background . in appendix [ ch : dgf ] we discuss variational derivatives by grassmann fields .",
    "it is a somewhat streamlined version of the approach of . as a crucial generalisation , it includes chain rules for variational grassmann derivatives , which are shown to be identical to those for conventional variational derivatives . in appendix [ ch : b ] , we show that wick s theorem may always be written as a hori - wick theorem ; in a sense , this statement is more general than wick s theorem itself .",
    "to better orient the reader we start from a simple example . consider an harmonic oscillator with the hamiltonian in the schrdinger  picture , @xmath0where @xmath1 are the bosonic creation / annihilation pair , @xmath2 } = 1 .",
