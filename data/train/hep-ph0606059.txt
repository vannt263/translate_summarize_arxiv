    "the fast development of laser technology in the last years has enabled novel applications of lasers in different areas @xcite .",
    "terawatt and petawatt table - top lasers are already employed , for example , to create new short - wavelength sources up to x - rays and @xmath0-rays @xcite , to accelerate particles with enormous acceleration rates ( even of the order of @xmath1 in the case of electrons ) @xcite and as drivers for nuclear fusion @xcite .",
    "strong optical laser pulses with intensities of order of @xmath2 have been already produced in laboratories @xcite and intensities of order of @xmath3 are envisaged @xcite . in the presence of such strong electromagnetic fields it is becoming feasible to probe the nonlinear properties of vacuum as predicted by quantum electrodynamics ( see the book in ref . @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "in fact , starting from the early works by delbrck @xcite , heisenberg and euler @xcite and weisskopf @xcite , numerous theoretical papers have been devoted to investigate how the presence of strong electromagnetic fields modifies the dielectric properties of the vacuum @xcite",
    ". the typical electric ( magnetic ) field strength at which these effects are predicted to become apparent is given by @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) corresponding to the huge intensity : @xmath6 . in the above expressions @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the negative charge and the mass of the electron , respectively . from a theoretical point of view , three different classes of electromagnetic fields have been considered as candidates able to `` polarize '' the vacuum : coulomb fields of highly charged nuclei @xcite , static magnetic fields @xcite and laser fields @xcite .",
    "so far , an experimental confirmation of the theoretical predictions has been achieved only for the first class with the observation of delbrck scattering @xcite and the related process of @xmath0-photon splitting in the field of a heavy nucleus @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the pvlas ( polarizzazione del vuoto con laser ) experiment is devoted to measure the extremely small ellipticity acquired by a linearly polarized probe laser after passing repeatedly through a vacuum region with an applied static uniform magnetic field of strength @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "experimental results have already been reported in ref . @xcite but they can not be explained as a nonlinear quantum electrodynamics effect but as an effect due to the possible conversion of a photon into a pseudoscalar particle , called axion . finally , in the experiments so far performed no interaction has been detected between strong laser beams in vacuum @xcite . nevertheless , recent estimations of vacuum polarization effects ( vpes ) in laser - laser collisions , as in ref .",
    "@xcite in the geometrical optics limit and in ref .",
    "@xcite with the inclusion of diffractive effects , have shown a feasibility to observe vpes in the near future .    when a strong laser wave , able to polarize the vacuum , encounters matter , a plasma is immediately created . already at intensities above @xmath10 for optical frequencies",
    "this plasma is relativistic and drastically modifies the laser wave evolution .",
    "laser self - focusing , self - channeling and plasma self - induced transparency are only a few of the numerous effects arising during the propagation of a laser field through a relativistic plasma ( see the book in ref .",
    "@xcite , the recent reviews in refs . @xcite and the references therein ) . from another side , super - strong short - wavelength electromagnetic radiation fields approaching the value of the critical field",
    "have been predicted via the interaction of a strong laser pulse with an inhomogeneous plasma @xcite .",
    "in this situation , vpes could significantly modify the dynamics both of the plasma and of the laser field .",
    "the influence of the absorptive features of the vacuum polarization , namely the possibility of pair creation , on the propagation of a strong electromagnetic wave through an electron - positron plasma has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite where the dispersive effects of vacuum polarization have been neglected .",
    "the related back - reaction effects in the pair production process in crossed laser beams have been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and non - markovian effects in the pair production kinetics have been found .",
    "the dispersive vpes can significantly modify the radiation propagation in a plasma as it has been shown in refs . @xcite and more recently in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also the review in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the authors refer to astrophysical scenarios where vpes are due to a strong static magnetic field and transform the dispersion equation of a probe wave in such a way to allow the propagation of a new low - frequency mode in plasma .",
    "it has been shown also that in nonlinear regime a shock wave can be formed in magnetized plasmas due to the vpes which could be important for the evolution of supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "also , vacuum polarization corrections to wave propagation in unmagnetized as well as in magnetized plasma have been investigated in ref .",
    "another manifestation of the vpes in plasma , namely , the photon - photon scattering in a laser - produced channel in overdense plasma has been considered in ref .",
    "the plasma channel traps the laser field providing high radiation field intensity on relatively long distances .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the role of dispersive vpes in the strong laser wave propagation in plasma in a new regime of physical parameters .",
    "in fact , the problem of the propagation of a strong laser wave in a relativistic plasma has been studied for the first time in the seminal work in ref .",
    "@xcite by akhiezer and polovin . in the paper in ref .",
    "@xcite an exact analytical solution of this problem was found in the case of the propagation of a plane wave with circular polarization .",
    "the solution obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite holds under ideal assumptions like the plane - wave one but it has provided a qualitative understanding of what happens in a relativistic plasma in more complicated situations . up to now",
    "the akhiezer - polovin solution remains the only exact solvable model for the strong laser wave propagation in plasma , while nowadays , the quantitative theoretical study of relativistic plasma dynamics in realistic conditions is mostly performed via numerical solutions . in view of the ever increasing available laser intensities , we reconsider in the present paper the akhiezer - polovin problem by taking into account the vpes . since the critical intensity @xmath11 remains many orders of magnitude larger than the available ones , a first - order perturbative solution of the problem in vpes will be obtained .",
    "the solution shows a large enhancement of the vpes in plasma with respect to those predicted in pure vacuum when the frequency of the probe field ( that in our case is also the field that polarizes the vacuum ) approaches the plasma frequency . a decisive role in this sense",
    "is played by the singular dielectric behaviour of the plasma near the plasma frequency .",
    "in contrast to this , the plasma was assumed in refs .",
    "@xcite to be tenuous that is , the frequency of the radiation propagating in the plasma is much larger than the plasma frequency . in that regime",
    "the enhancement of the vpes we consider here , is completely suppressed .",
    "it must also be stressed that , despite quantum electrodynamics is a well established theory from an experimental point of view , dispersive vpes induced by laser fields have not yet been observed .",
    "the reason is essentially that the observation of these effects requires very intense lasers beams . in the following",
    "we propose a possible experimental implementation of the ideas previously mentioned in order to exploit the plasma enhancement of vpes to measure for the first time vpes themselves .",

    "in ref . @xcite akhiezer and polovin solved exactly the problem of the propagation of a circularly polarized plane wave through a cold relativistic collisionless plasma . in their calculations",
    "the plasma was described as a one - component relativistic electron fluid moving in the presence of a fixed ion background . in the following we consider the analogous problem of the propagation of a strong electromagnetic field with circular polarization through a cold plasma but including the vpes induced by the strong field itself .",
    "in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , we will take into account the motion of the ions because , for example , a proton moves relativistically in the presence of an optical laser field with intensity we are interested in of order of @xmath13 .",
    "the approximation of cold plasma is well justified because the thermal motion can be neglected with respect to the highly relativistic motion driven by the external strong field .",
    "finally , we also include the effects of the electron - ion collisions because they can play a role in the frequency region we are interested in , that is close to the plasma frequency .",
    "the equations that describe the previous physical scenario are essentially maxwell equations in the presence of two real charged fluids with their fluids equations of motion , and of an additional `` vacuum fluid '' represented by the four - current @xmath14 analyzed below : @xmath15 it is more convenient to start discussing eqs .",

    "this approximation is very well justified at field amplitudes much smaller than the critical field not only at zero - temperature but also at finite temperatures such that @xmath46 .",

    "( [ div_d])-([eq_mot_p ] ) formally identical to the akhiezer - polovin one : @xmath56 where we have introduced the wave phase @xmath57 with @xmath58 being the wave refractive index . as in akhiezer - polovin case",
    ", we have assumed the plasma to remain always locally neutral .",
    "this approximation is justified for laser pulses circularly polarized [ as that considered in eqs .",
    "( [ e_fin ] ) and ( [ b_fin ] ) ] and much longer than the plasma characteristic time @xmath59 needed to restore quasineutrality [ see eq .",
    "( [ omega_pl_0 ] ) below for the definition of the _ effective _ plasma frequency @xmath60 . in the following",
    "we will assume that this is the case .",
    "in particular , we will be interested in the regime @xmath61 ; then we will implicitly consider laser pulses lasting many laser periods .",
    "the above solution has the property that the two electromagnetic invariants that enter the vacuum polarization four - current are @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively . in this way , by plugging the above expressions into eqs .",
    "( [ div_d])-([eq_mot_p ] ) one easily obtains that they solve those equations if @xmath64 where we have introduced the non - relativistic plasma frequencies @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the relativistic lorentz factors @xmath68 and the wave refractive index in the absence of vpes @xmath69 with the _ effective _ plasma frequency being @xmath70 the above solution describes exactly the wave propagation through the plasma by including the vpes . as it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ n_0 ] ) , the vpes modify the wave refractive index .",
    "we observe that since we are interested in wave frequencies close to the effective plasma frequency @xmath71 we are not allowed for the moment to expand further the square root in eq .",
    "( [ n_0 ] ) with respect to vpes even if we have neglected from the beginning terms proportional to @xmath72 with respect to those of order of unity . in this respect , it is interesting to note that , although we have considered the vpes up to first order in @xmath73 in the maxwell equations ( [ div_d ] ) and ( [ rot_h ] ) , our final result contains vacuum terms to all orders because they are compared with quantities that in principle can be much smaller than unity . concerning the influence of vpes on the refractive index @xmath74 some comments are in order .",
    "first , we observe that the vpes do not result in a simple scaling of the plasma frequency . moreover , as in pure vacuum , the vpes imply an increase of the wave refractive index and then a decrease of its speed",
    ". one can understand intuitively this fact by noting that including the vpes means to consider the possibility that during its propagation a photon can `` transform '' into a virtual electron - positron pair that then annihilates giving back the initial photon .",
    "it is sensible that due to this `` transformation '' into a pair of massive particles the photon is slowed down because the effective speed of the electron - positron pair is less than the speed of light .",
    "finally , we point out that at small plasma densities , i. e. if @xmath75 , the vpes vanish . on one hand",
    ", this corresponds to the fact that in vacuum a plane wave does not polarize the vacuum itself @xcite . on the other hand , this implies that in the situation considered here , the vpes on the refractive index can not be independent of the plasma quantities , in particular of its density . from this point of view",
    "we can conclude that the polarization of the vacuum arises here due to the essential modification of the strong wave by the electromagnetic field produced by the electron and ion currents in plasma driven by the strong wave itself .",
    "equation ( [ n_0 ] ) already contains the indication that an enhancement of vpes compared with those in vacuum can arise when the frequency of the laser field approaches the plasma frequency .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath76 , the refractive index is mainly determined by the vpes : @xmath77 and it scales as the square root of the small parameter of the vacuum correction @xmath73 .",
    "meanwhile in vacuum , the vacuum polarization correction to the refractive index is always proportional to @xmath73 .",
    "of course , this limiting case has little physical implication because of the strong reflection of the laser wave from plasma and its absorption in plasma .",
    "nevertheless , the mentioned tendency of enhancement of vpes remains in the regime when the laser frequency is close to the plasma frequency but when the wave propagation in plasma still takes place .",
    "this is discussed in the next section .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , the vpes affect the refractive index of the strong wave . then , in order to detect these effects we need to make at least two waves to interfere .",
    "nevertheless , due to the nonlinearity of the plasma equations , the superposition principle does not hold in the plasma .",
    "for this reason we consider the experimental setup schematically described in fig .",
    "1 . a laser beam with intensity @xmath78 and frequency @xmath38 is linearly polarized along the @xmath79 axis and it is split into two waves with intensities @xmath80 and @xmath81 such that @xmath82 .",
    "each wave passes through a quarter - wave plate and becomes circularly polarized but in such a way that the two electric fields rotate in opposite directions .",
    "then , they enter two different plasmas with densities @xmath83 and @xmath84 . in the approximations discussed in the previous sections we can write the electric fields of the two waves as in eq .",
    "( [ e_fin ] ) by distinguishing them by means of the index @xmath85 and by accounting for the fact that they rotate in opposite directions .",
    "we point out here that the electric field amplitude @xmath51 appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ e_fin ] ) and ( [ n_0 ] ) is the electric field amplitude of the wave _ in the plasma_. experimentally the laser wave is produced in vacuum and then it enters the plasma . in the case of normal incidence the laser electric field amplitude is connected with the corresponding quantity in vacuum @xmath86 by the formula @xmath87 @xcite and then the two electric field amplitudes @xmath88 in the plasmas are given by @xmath89 with @xmath90 being the refractive indices of the two plasmas . in this respect , since for each @xmath91 the quantity @xmath90 also depends on @xmath88 , then both @xmath90 and @xmath88 must be determined consistently from eqs .",
    "( [ n_0 ] ) and ( [ t ] ) once the intensity in vacuum @xmath92 and the density @xmath93 are given .",
    "now , if after a distance @xmath55 the two waves exit the plasmas with amplitudes @xmath94 and are made to interfere , the total electric field @xmath95 can be written as @xmath96\\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is a common phase and @xmath98 is the total phase difference between the two waves .",
    "the quantity @xmath99 can be written as @xmath100 the wave with electric field ( [ e ] ) is elliptically polarized but due to the phase difference in the second term the main axes of the ellipse are rotated with respect to the @xmath79 and @xmath101 axes by the angle @xmath102 .",
    "this rotation angle is the quantity to be measured in order to detect the vpes .",
    "equation ( [ delta_phi ] ) clearly shows the possibility with respect to pure vacuum of enhancing the vpes in plasma by exploiting the singular behaviour of the plasma refractive index for laser frequencies close to the effective plasma frequency .",
    "in fact , the typical expression of the analogous phase difference in vacuum corresponding to @xmath98 is given by @xmath103 .",
    "then , if in eq .",
    "( [ delta_phi ] ) @xmath104 , i. e. if @xmath105 , the polarization rotation angle in plasma due to vpes is much larger than @xmath106",
    ".    nevertheless , we have to point out that while in pure vacuum the _ total _ phase difference is already proportional to the vpes , instead in plasma the phase difference contains a plasma contribution .",
    "then , the problem here is to isolate the vpes in a measurable way . to achieve this",
    "we require the two waves to have the same zero - order refractive index @xmath107 ( for the sake of clarity , we have explicitly indicated the dependence of the refractive index on the plasma density and on the wave intensity in vacuum ) .",
    "although , it is desirable that the laser intensities of these two beams are differing as much as possible to have a larger difference in the refractive index due to vpes [ see eq .",
    "( [ delta_phi ] ) ]",
    ". we can achieve our goal by choosing different densities @xmath83 and @xmath84 for the two plasmas .",
    "thus , for the fixed densities @xmath83 and @xmath84 as well as the laser frequency @xmath38 , the laser intensities @xmath80 and @xmath81 have to be adjusted in such a way [ see eq .",
    "( [ n_pl ] ) ] that : @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the value of the zero - order refractive index that we want to assign to both plasmas . of course , in order to obtain physically `` sensible '' values of the intensities @xmath80 and @xmath81 , the two densities can not have arbitrary values . in fig .",
    "2 we show a numerical particular example of the outlined procedure . first , we have fixed the laser photon energy equal to @xmath110 , the ion charge equal to @xmath111 ( corresponding to palladium ) and @xmath112 .",
    "we stress that with these numerical values and in the whole ranges represented in fig .",
    "2 , then @xmath113 . now ,",
    "the continuous line in fig .",
    "2 shows the pairs @xmath114 that solve the implicit equation @xmath115 .",
    "instead , the dotted line corresponds to the approximated analytical solution [ see also eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) ] @xmath116 ^ 2 - 1\\right\\}\\frac{\\omega^2}{m^2_e}i_{cr}\\ ] ] obtained in the limit @xmath117 and that , as expected , underestimates the correct intensities when they become of order of @xmath13 at which the ion motion can not be neglected . following the above procedure , if , for example , @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the two plasma densities , then we would choose the two intensities as @xmath120 and @xmath121 ( see fig .",
    "the necessity to have high plasma densities comes from the fact that the effective plasma frequency @xmath122 must be slightly smaller than the strong laser frequency @xmath38 which lies typically in the optical domain .",
    "moreover , high laser intensities decrease the effective plasma frequency .    by means of the above described procedure",
    ", the polarization rotation angle @xmath99 gives a measure of the vacuum polarization effects and it is given by @xmath123 where we used the fact that , as we have said , in the previous numerical example @xmath113 . by substituting these parameters in eq .",
    "( [ delta_phi_f ] ) we obtain a rotation angle @xmath124 after a propagation distance of five laser wavelengths in plasma corresponding to @xmath125 . in order to compare this result with those obtained in vacuum we refer to the light - by - light diffraction process described in ref .",
    "in fact , as we have observed , one single plane wave in vacuum does not give rise to vpes .",
    "since we have assumed in our example that the two beams are obtained by splitting an initial laser beam , for a fair comparison we have to use in vacuum the total intensity @xmath126 and we obtain @xmath127 which is more than one order of magnitude less than @xmath128 .",
    "this result in vacuum can be easily derived by looking at the quantity indicated as @xmath129 in fig . 2 in ref .",
    "it shows the polarization rotation angle that an x - ray probe undergoes by interacting with a strong optical standing wave as a function of the distance between the photon polarimeter and the lasers collision region . in the figure",
    "the strong optical wave intensity is @xmath130 and , since the dependence on the polarimeter distance is weak and since the rotation angle is proportional to the strong optical laser intensity , the desired rotation polarization angle can be obtained by multiplying the average value of the rotation angle in the figure , which is approximately @xmath131 , times @xmath132/10^{23}$ ] .",
    "we mention here that the tuning of the intensities @xmath92 to eliminate the pure plasma contribution to @xmath102 can be avoided by performing different experiments with different laser peak intensities @xmath78 . in this case",
    ", one could reveal the presence of vpes by fitting the resulting experimental curve @xmath133 by using eq .",
    "( [ delta_phi ] ) with and without the inclusion of vpes .    from the previous analysis",
    "we can conclude that the presence of a plasma can give rise to a large enhancement of the vpes .",
    "this result is very relevant also because , as it is clear from the above example , in plasma there is a significant disadvantage ( that has been accounted for ) with respect to vacuum .",
    "in fact , in vacuum one can use high - frequency , i.e. x - ray , probes for which the phase difference is proportionally larger than that for optical probes . instead in plasma , since the probe field ( that here is the same as the strong field ) must have a frequency close to the plasma frequency one is forced to use at most optical probes that already require high electron densities of order of @xmath134 .    despite the above results , we are aware of the practical difficulties that are behind the experimental realization of the previous setup . the two intensities @xmath80 and @xmath81 must be carefully adjusted in order to eliminate the spurious zero - order effects in @xmath102 due to the presence of the plasma .",
    "also , since the strong waves have frequencies close to the effective plasma frequency different kinds of plasma instabilities can arise like , for example , the so - called parametric resonance ( see ref . @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "finally , other difficulties have to be mentioned that are connected with the basic assumptions of our model .",
    "for example , the monochromatic - wave approximation has allowed us to isolate , at least theoretically , the vpes and to obtain an analytical estimate of them .",
    "nevertheless , if we considered a more realistic pulsed wave with a transverse profile then the treatment would be much more complex and many other effects should be taken into account like laser self - focusing , channeling , filamentation and so on ( see ref . @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "a further remark is in order because some effects can hinder the laser penetration into the plasma .",
    "we mention here the parametric instabilities and the plasma density profile steepening . on the one hand ,",
    "the excitation time of the raman instability is extremely short , about half of the laser period @xcite , excluding the possibility to avoid it by using short laser pulses . nevertheless",
    ", the parametric instabilities saturate due to nonlinear mechanisms before the laser beam will be depleted @xcite .",
    "moreover , the transmission of the laser wave through the plasma improves at laser intensities exceeding @xmath135w/@xmath136 @xcite , and almost half of the laser pulse can be transmitted through the plasma on the length of about @xmath137 wavelengths . on the other hand ,",
    "the profile steepening of the electron and ion densities due to the laser ponderomotive force can play a more important role .",
    "because of this effect the laser intensity threshold for induced transparency is significantly raised at a given plasma density , or the density threshold is decreased at a fixed laser intensity @xcite .",
    "as we have observed , we have chosen high plasma densities of order of @xmath134 to fulfill the condition of the near overdense plasma @xmath61 with @xmath38 in the optical region . instead , we could exploit the density profile steepening to consider smaller initial plasma densities . in this case",
    "one could expect the effect of enhancement of vpes to be present at the new resulting threshold of the plasma transparency but only in the steepening region .",
    "this is because the enhancement effect arises when the effective refractive index of the plasma tends to zero . in order to discuss quantitatively all the above effects a detailed analysis in more realistic conditions",
    "is required .",
    "this would include , for example , particle - in - cell simulations and it is out of the scope of the present treatment that is meant to be essentially qualitative .    one final comment concerns the practical difficulty in measuring rotation polarization angles @xmath138 with an accuracy of the order of vacuum polarization corrections , that is @xmath131 in our numerical example .",

    "we will include the effects of electron - ion collisions in the next section and , actually , it will appear that the previous experimental setup has to be modified .",
    "in the previous section we have considered the propagation of a strong wave through a collisionless plasma in order to point out the role of the vpes and to show how they are enhanced with respect to pure vacuum and how they can be detected experimentally . the enhancement is significant when the laser frequency is slightly larger than the plasma frequency . as we have already observed , in this parameter region the inclusion of collisional effects is conceptually relevant .",
    "in this section we want to investigate this case that will turn out technically more complex than the collisionless case already considered . nevertheless , we want to point out here that the final conclusions about the enhancement and the measurability of vpes will not be changed by the inclusion of the collisional effects .",
