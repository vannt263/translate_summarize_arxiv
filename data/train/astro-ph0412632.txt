    "the one - dimensional mass power spectrum ( ps ) and its relation to the three - dimensional mass ps have been frequently utilized to recover the linear mass ps from the ly@xmath1 forest @xcite .",
    "this opens a great window for studying the large - scale structure of the universe over a wide range of redshift .",
    "as one starts to attempt precision cosmology using the ly@xmath1 forest @xcite , it becomes necessary to quantify systematic uncertainties of the ps analysis including the covariance .",
    "for an ensemble of isotropic fields , the one - dimensional mass ps @xmath2 is a simple integral of the three - dimensional mass ps @xmath3 @xcite , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the line - of - sight wavenumber .",
    "however , there is only one observable universe .",
    "one has to replace the ensemble average with a spatial average .",
    "for instance , one may sample multiple line - of - sight densities from the three - dimensional cosmic density field and use the average ps of the one - dimensional densities in place of the ensemble - average quantity .",
    "the covariance of the spatial - average ps may differ from that of the ensemble - average ps for at least two reasons .",
    "first , lines of sight ( los s ) are no longer independent of each other .",
    "correlations between close los s could increase the covariance of the one - dimensional mass ps , although they may also be used to extract cosmological parameters from the ly@xmath1 forest @xcite .",
    "second , the length of each los is always much less than the size of the universe , so that false correlations between different modes are introduced in the covariance ( for the three - dimensional case , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . because the cosmic density field is highly non - gaussian on scales of interest , @xmath0-body simulations are helpful for quantifying the covariance",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : p3d ] briefly describes the notation and the convention of fourier transforms , the three - dimensional mass ps , and its covariance . the spatial - average one - dimensional mass ps and its covariance are derived in sections [ sec:321 ] and [ sec : cov ] , respectively .",
    "the effects of the line - of - sight length is discussed in section [ sec : short ] .",
    "section [ sec : test ] presents numerical results of the covariance from @xmath0-body simulations with different box sizes .",
    "the conclusions and discussions are given in section [ sec : con ] . unless specified otherwise , the ps refers to the mass ps .",
    "we assume the following convention of fourier transforms for a cubic density field of volume @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the overdensity and its fourier counterpart , respectively , the summation @xmath10 is an abbreviation for @xmath11 , and the wavevector @xmath12 . with the understanding",
    "that fourier modes exist only at discrete wavenumbers , i.e. @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are integers , one may use @xmath16 and @xmath17 interchangeably for convenience . to be complete ,",
    "the orthonormality relations are @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the three - dimensional kronecker delta function , and @xmath20 the dirac delta function .",

    "one may define an observed ps , @xmath23 .",
    "note that a shot - noise term should be included if the ps is measured from discrete objects , and it is inversely proportional to the mean number density of the objects .",
    "we neglect the shot noise in this paper . for an isotropic universe",

    "there is a redundancy in the variables of the trispectrum , which has only six degrees of freedom arising from relative coordinates of the four points under the constraint of homogeneity @xcite .",

    ", the survey volume is always smaller than the observable universe , and the survey geometry is more complex than the simple case we have assumed .",
    "these lead to a modification of the covariance for grfs @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a weight function that depends on the survey volume and geometry , and the shot noise is neglected .",
    "for the low - redshift cosmic density field , the non - gaussianity can dramatically boost the elements of the covariance matrix through the trispectrum .",
    "for a line - of - sight density that is along the @xmath34-axis and sampled at @xmath35 , the one - dimensional fourier transform gives @xmath36 where the subscript @xmath37 signifies the first two components of a vector , i.e. @xmath38 . similar to the three - dimensional ps , the one - dimensional ps is expected to follow @xmath39 substituting equation ( [ eq : fourier1d ] ) in equation ( [ eq : ens1d ] ) and making use of equation ( [ eq : powsp_n ] ) , one finds the relation between the one - dimensional ps and the three - dimensional ps , @xmath40 which is a discrete analog of equation ( [ eq : iso321 ] ) .    practically , one measures ps s of los densities sampled at some locations , e.g.  @xmath41 , where @xmath42 runs over all los s sampled in a single universe . to assess the performance of the estimator",
    ", two questions need to be addressed : ( 1 ) how does @xmath43 relate itself to @xmath44 ; and ( 2 ) what is the covariance of @xmath43 with respect to @xmath45 ?",
    "the rest of this section answers the former , and section [ sec : cov ] the latter .    for simplicity",
    ", we assume that los s are sampled regularly in transverse directions at an interval of @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is an integer . each los has a length of @xmath48 , and @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "the estimated one - dimensional ps is then @xmath51 where the equality , @xmath52 has been used to obtain the last line in equation ( [ eq : raw - p1d ] ) .",
    "it is easy to show with equation ( [ eq : raw - p1d ] ) that @xmath53 note that there is no spatial average on the far right side of equation ( [ eq : p1d - ens - x ] ) .",
    "it seems that only in the limit @xmath54 do @xmath43 and @xmath44 follow the same relation as equations ( [ eq : iso321 ] ) and ( [ eq:321sum ] ) , i.e.  @xmath55 , where we have assumed @xmath56 so that only @xmath57 terms contribute . in other words , to reduce the uncertainties of the recovered @xmath44 and @xmath24 , one has to increase the sampling rate in the transverse direction .    without losing generality",
    ", one may choose @xmath47 to be even , so that equation ( [ eq : raw - p1d ] ) can be re - arranged into @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60.\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq : est - p1d ] ) provides two equivalent views of the sampling effect .",
    "on one hand , the one - dimensional ps is a sum of the aliased three - dimensional ps , @xmath61 , that is sampled by a grid of @xmath62 los s . on the other hand , it is a complete sum of the underlying three - dimensional ps with an extra term @xmath63 that is determined by the sampling rate and properties of the density field .",
    "the discrete fourier transform can not distinguish a principal mode at @xmath64 from its aliases at @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the sampling nyquist wavenumber .",
    "for example , @xmath67 if one samples the field at an equal spacing of @xmath68 .",
    "the alias modes will be added to the principal mode if they are not properly filtered out before sampling ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "since the cosmic density field is not band - limited , aliasing can distort statistics of the field .",
    "the distortion on the three - dimensional ps can not be quantified _ a priori _ , because it depends on relative phases between the principal mode and its aliases .",
    "the alias effect is less pronounced , if amplitudes of the alias modes are much smaller than that of the principal mode . since the three - dimensional ps decreases toward small scales , a high sampling rate ( or @xmath66 ) can suppress aliasing for modes with @xmath69 .",
    "if the fourier modes of the density field are uncorrelated , the term @xmath63 may be neglected even for a finite number of los s and , therefore , validate equation ( [ eq:321sum ] ) .",
    "strictly speaking , @xmath63 vanishes only as an ensemble average over many grfs , but since there are so many independent modes in a shell of radius around @xmath5  especially at large wavenumbers  the summation in @xmath63 will tend to vanish even for a single grf .",
    "the cosmic density field is more gaussian at higher redshift , so equation ( [ eq:321sum ] ) may be a good approximation then . at low redshift",
    ", however , the non - gaussianity alters the statistics of one - dimensional fields ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such that one might only be able to recover a heavily aliased three - dimensional ps from a sparse sample of los s .",
    "the covariance of the ps is of interest because it tells us how likely an estimated ps is to represent the true ps and how much the modes on different scales are correlated .",
    "for the one - dimensional ps , the covariance is defined as @xmath70 [ \\mathcal{p}_{\\rm 1d}(k_3 ' ) - p_{\\rm 1d}(k_3 ' ) ] \\rangle.\\ ] ] the covariance of the mean ps of @xmath0 los s that are sampled in a single field can be expanded into a sum of pair - wise covariances between two los s separated by @xmath71 , e.g. @xmath72 where @xmath73",

    "the four - point function [ equation ( [ eq:4point ] ) ] helps reduce the pair - wise covariance to @xmath78/b } - p_{\\rm 1d}(n_3)p_{\\rm 1d}(n_3 ' ) \\\\ & = & \\big |\\frac{1}{b^2 } \\sum_{\\bmath{n}_\\perp = -\\infty}^{\\infty }   p_{\\rm 3d}(\\bmath{n}_\\perp , n_3)\\ , e^{2\\pi i \\bmath{n}_\\perp \\cdot\\ , \\bmath{s } / b }   \\big |^2 \\delta^{\\rm k}_{n_3 , n_3 ' } \\equiv |\\xi(\\bmath{s } , n_3)|^2 \\delta^{\\rm k}_{n_3 , n_3'},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscript and superscript are dropped for @xmath79 .",
    "fourier transforms of @xmath80 will give the three - dimensional ps and correlation function of the density field , and @xmath81 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "because of isotropy , the pair - wise covariance @xmath82 and @xmath80 depend only on the magnitude of the separation , i.e.  @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "if one los is sampled from each grf , the variance of the measured one - dimensional ps @xmath43 is @xmath85 , analogous to the three - dimensional case .",
    "if @xmath86 los s are sampled in each grf on a regular grid as in section [ sec:321 ] , e.g.  @xmath79 = @xmath87 , the covariance becomes @xmath88   = \\frac{1}{n^2 b^4 }   \\sum_{\\bmath{n}_\\perp , \\bmath{n}'_\\perp = -\\infty}^{\\infty } \\!\\!\\!\\!\\ !",

    "this result can be easily obtained using equations ( [ eq:4point ] ) and ( [ eq : raw - p1d ] ) as well .",
    "it is seen that the summation in the last line of equation ( [ eq : cov - sum ] ) runs over only one mode out of every @xmath0 modes in the fourier space .",
    "if the three - dimensional ps were constant , the variance of the mean ps of the @xmath0 los s would be @xmath0 times smaller than the variance of the ps of a single los .",
    "this is coincident with the theory of the variance of the mean .",
    "since the cosmic density field is not a grf in general , equation ( [ eq : cov - sum ] ) is not expected to give an accurate estimate .",
    "if the @xmath0 los s are sampled randomly in each grf , the summation over los s in the second line of equation ( [ eq : cov - sum ] ) should be re - cast to read @xmath89 since @xmath74 is randomly distributed , the second sum in equation ( [ eq : cov - ran ] ) tends to vanish for a large number of los s except when @xmath90 .",
    "thus , one obtains @xmath91 again , it shows that the variance of @xmath43 is inversely proportional to the number of los s , but this is valid only for a large number of los s randomly sampled in a grf .    through the gaussian case one can find the lowest bound of the uncertainty for a measured one - dimensional ps and the minimum number of los s needed for a target precision .",
    "for example , to measure the one - dimensional ps of grfs accurate to @xmath92 on _ every _ mode , one needs at least 400 los s . however , the cosmic density field has a far more complex covariance due to its non - vanishing trispectrum , and it can have a much larger variance of the measured one - dimensional ps .",
    "the trispectrum introduces an extra term to the covariance of the one - dimensional ps in addition to the gaussian piece [ equation ( [ eq : cov - sum ] ) ] , i.e. @xmath93 where @xmath94 @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 are the transverse components of @xmath17 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , respectively , and @xmath102 . in deriving equation ( [ eq : cov - tri ] ) ,",
    "we have made use of equations ( [ eq:4point ] ) and ( [ eq : raw - p1d ] ) .",
    "observationally , the length of a los is always much less than the size of the observable universe . for example , in the case of a pencil - beam survey , the length is limited by the depth of the survey . for the ly@xmath1 forest ,",
    "it is often determined by the distance between the starting redshift of ly@xmath1 and ly@xmath103 lines .",
    "damped ly@xmath1 systems and other astrophysical or instrumental factors can break the spectrum into yet shorter chunks .",
    "even if a very long los were obtained , one might still wish to measure the ps on smaller segments to avoid evolutionary effects . to account for the length of los s , the one - dimensional ps and",
    "its covariance must be re - formulated .    for a los from @xmath104 to @xmath105 ,",

    "because @xmath111 and @xmath112 are not orthogonal to each other , the term @xmath113 is no longer diagonal with respect to @xmath110 and @xmath114 .",
    "however , it remains diagonal - dominant .",

    "although the mean ps of all the @xmath158 los s agrees with the result of a direct summation of the three - dimensional ps using equation ( [ eq:321fsum ] ) , the deviation of the ps for any particular group of 64 or 1024 los s is substantial , especially at @xmath163 .",
    "the variance is smaller at @xmath144 than at @xmath163 because the cosmic density field is more gaussian earlier on , and it is roughly inversely proportional to the number of los s .",
    "this can be seen better by comparing the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cov64 ] with that of fig .",
    "[ fig : cov1024 ] .",
    "however , even at @xmath144 the variance of the one - dimensional ps is still much higher than the variance for grfs , @xmath173 , which indicates a heavy contribution from the trispectrum .",
    "the formulae in sections [ sec:321][sec : short ] often assume that los s are sampled on a grid with fixed spacing , which may not be applicable to realistic data such as inverted densities from the ly@xmath1 forest @xcite .",
    "therefore , we sample the los s in two ways in fig .  [",
    "fig : var1d ] : grid sampling and random sampling . since no significant difference",
    "is observed , random sampling can be safely applied in the rest of this paper .    .",
    "diamonds are the normalized variance @xmath165 ( multiplied by @xmath0 ) for b128 at @xmath128 .",
    "circles correspond to the middle column of fig .",
    "[ fig : cov64l ] , which imposes the selection criterion @xmath174 .",
    "squares are from the low - resolution calculation in the right column of fig .",

    "[ fig : covlen],width=576 ]    the normalized covariances @xmath141 and @xmath176 are quantified in figs .",
    "[ fig : cov64 ] ( @xmath159 ) and [ fig : cov1024 ] ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "the left column in each figure is the covariances of the spatially averaged one - dimensional ps from a single grf that has the same box size and three - dimensional ps as its corresponding simulation",
    ". clearly , the covariances based on spatial average are nearly diagonal with unity diagonal elements .",
    "this is in agreement with the expectations based on ensemble average for grfs and is consistent with the ergodicity argument .",
    "the middle column is similar to the left column except that the density fields are from simulations at @xmath144 .",
    "the modes in the simulated density fields are strongly correlated , so that the covariances are no longer diagonal . in other words , the trispectrum is non - vanishing for the cosmic density field , as it is the only term that contributes to off - diagonal elements in the covariance .",
    "the cosmic density field becomes so non - gaussian at @xmath160 that grey scale figures of the covariances will not be readable .",
    "hence , we only plot four cross sections perpendicular the diagonal with @xmath164 for b128 and b256 in the right column .",
    "the dominance of the diagonals suggested by these cross sections is actually weaker than that in the middle column , which can be seen by contrasting the cross sections for b128 at @xmath160 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cov64 ] with that for b128 at @xmath128 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cov64l ] .",
    "the non - gaussianity is reflected not only in the correlations between different modes but also in the variance of the one - dimensional ps , i.e.  the diagonal elements of the normalized covariance @xmath177 .",
    "the lower right panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : cov64 ] and [ fig : cov1024 ] compare @xmath165 for five different density fields .",
    "the variance from the simulation b128 is orders of magnitude higher than the gaussian value of @xmath178 , and it grows as the non - gaussianity becomes stronger toward @xmath163 . as a result ,",
    "the sample variance error estimated for grfs is much lower than what can be actually measured from the cosmic density field . according to equation ( [ eq : cov - tri ] ) ,",
    "both aliasing and the trispectrum contribute to the variance .",
    "since the grfs have the same three - dimensional ps and are sampled in the same way as the simulations , their near - gaussian variances of spatially averaged one - dimensional ps s suggest that the contribution of the aliasing effect is negligible .",
    "comparisons of @xmath165 for the same density field but with different sizes of sample ( @xmath159 and 1024 ) confirm the observation in fig .",
    "[ fig : var1d ] that the variance of the one - dimensional ps scales roughly as @xmath179 .",
    "this means that even though the non - gaussianity drives up the sample variance error of the measured one - dimensional ps , one can still reduce the error by sampling a large number of los s .",
    "the statistics of a large sample may sometimes be dominated by a small fraction of extreme cases .",
    "it is inevitable that some of the los s in our sample go through high - density halo structures , which may have significant contributions to the covariance matrices . to determine if a los falls in this category one has to assess the density profile intercepted by the los .",
    "we follow a much simpler approach by imposing a threshold to the mass column densities @xmath180 of the los s .",
    "the one - point distribution function of column density contrast @xmath181 from the simulation b128 ( upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cov64l ] ) peaks at @xmath182 as expected , and there clearly is a long - tail distribution ( as compared to gaussian or log - normal distributions ) of @xmath183 a few .",
    "we re - calculate the covariance @xmath141 with a selection criterion that the column density of each los @xmath184 .",
    "this criterion excludes 318 los s from the selection of los s for the statistics . as a total of @xmath185 los s",
    "are randomly selected from @xmath158 candidates , only half of the 318 los s , i.e. 0.1% of the sample , would be selected without the criterion .",
    "the result is shown in the upper middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cov64l ] , which is visually similar to the b128 @xmath144 panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : cov64 ] .",
    "however , the cross sections of @xmath141 with the selection criterion ( lower middle panel of fig .  [ fig : cov64l ] ) do demonstrate a several - percent reduction of the off - diagonal elements in contrast to those without the selection criterion ( lower left panel ) . in other words , the 0.1% @xmath186 los s",
    "contribute at least 10 times as much to the covariance per los as @xmath174 los s do .",
    "it is also useful to have a comparison of the normalized covariance @xmath177 because , unlike the reduced covariance @xmath187 that only tells the relative strength between the diagonal and off - diagonal elements , @xmath177 reflects absolute values of the covariance up to a factor of the product of ps s at @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "[ fig : var64l ] shows the diagonal elements of the normalized covariance for b128 .",
    "it is seen that the variance @xmath165 of the one - dimensional ps is indeed reduced by roughly a factor of 2 on all scales when the @xmath190 @xmath186 los s are excluded .    for a fixed number of particles , the simulation box sets a cut - off scale , below which fluctuations can not be properly represented in low - density regions such as the ly@xmath1 forest . in other words ,",
    "the number of particles and the size of the simulation determine the highest - wavenumber modes that are included in calculations of the one - dimensional ps and its covariance .",
    "since the non - gaussianity is stronger at smaller scales , a larger simulation box cuts off more small - scale fluctuations and may cause the correlation to appear weaker in figs .",
    "[ fig : cov64 ] and [ fig : cov1024 ] . to test this",
    ", we assign the density field of the simulation b128 at @xmath128 on a grid of @xmath171 nodes .",
    "the spatial resolution is the same as the simulation b512 on a grid of @xmath191 nodes .",
    "the covariance @xmath192 is calculated in the same way as those in fig .",
    "[ fig : cov64 ] but with fewer groups of los s .",
    "each group still has 64 los s .",
    "the results are shown in the right column of fig .",
    "[ fig : cov64l ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig : var64l ] . evidently , there is a significant reduction of the correlations between different modes as well as the variance of the one - dimensional ps .",
    "indeed , the variance from the low - resolution calculation is close to that from the b512 simulation .",
    "thus , the apparent resemblance between b512 and the grf r512 in figs .",
    "[ fig : cov64 ] and [ fig : cov1024 ] is mostly due to the low resolution of the large - box simulation .",
    "it is expected from equation ( [ eq : cov - short ] ) that the covariance matrix will not be diagonal if the length of los s is less than the size of the simulation box .",
    "[ fig : covlen ] shows the covariances that are calculated in the same way as those in fig .  [",
    "fig : cov64 ] for the grf r512 and the simulation b512 , except that each los is only 128 long .",
    "the effect of the length is not visible for the grf , but it does increase the correlation between different modes and doubles the variance of the one - dimensional ps for the simulation b512 . for real observations ,",
    "the los length is always much less than the size of the observable universe , so that the window function @xmath193 in the los direction will cause stronger mixing of modes and more pronounced increase of correlation and variance .",
    "we have investigated the covariance of the one - dimensional mass ps for both grfs and simulated density fields . the non - linear evolution and the non - gaussianity of the cosmic density field on small scales",

    "* ) have caused the correlation between the fluctuations on different scales and increased the cosmic variance of the one - dimensional ps . because of this , large number of los s are needed to accurately measure the one - dimensional ps and recover the three - dimensional ps .",
    "the length of los s introduces a window function in the line - of - sight direction , which mixes neighboring fourier modes in the cosmic density field .",
    "[ fig : covlen ] has demonstrated for simulations that the length of los s ( a quarter of the simulation box size ) does affect the covariance of the one - dimensional ps .",
    "the covariance of the observed one - dimensional ps will receive more contributions from this effect , because in practice the length of los s suitable for study is always much less than the size of the observable universe .",
    "one may reduce the cosmic variance by binning _",
    "independent _ fourier modes .",
    "however , since the modes of the cosmic density field are strongly correlated , binning will be less effective in reducing the sample variance error .",
    "on the other hand , the non - gaussian behaviour of the covariance provides important information of the field such as the trispectrum .",
    "our analysis shows that even with 64 los s at @xmath163 , the cosmic variance on the ps can be several times of the ps itself ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cov64 ] ) .",
    "thus , the extra power on the scale of @xmath194mpc ( @xmath195 ) measured by @xcite from 4 samples of pencil - beam galaxy surveys can still be consistent with standard cosmogonies ( with considerations of effects such as redshift distortion and non - gaussianity , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one may also infer the one - dimensional density field and measure the ps from the ly@xmath1 forest .",
    "since the ly@xmath1 flux is the direct observable , many works have been based on flux statistics , which are then used along with simulations to constrain cosmology .",
    "using @xmath0-body simulations and the pseudo - hydro technique , @xcite find that the mapping between the nearly - gaussian ly@xmath1 flux ps @xcite and the underlying one - dimensional mass ps ( in redshift space ) has a much larger scatter than that between the flux ps and the one - dimensional linear mass ps .",
    "this is expected because the one - dimensional ps of the cosmic density field has a variance much higher than the gaussian variance .",
    "therefore , one can measure the ly@xmath1 flux ps precisely with a small sample of los s , but to recover the mass ps to the same precision more los s are needed .",
