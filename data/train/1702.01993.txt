    "the number of species with different sizes is so large that we can consider a continuous size polydispersity as a reasonable approximation .",
    "however , the inclusion of a continuous size - polydispersity in theoretical models considerably complicates its numerical implementation .",
    "this constitutes the reason why the moments method was developed as a powerful theoretical tool to approximately solve the equations resulting from the two - phase coexistence calculations @xcite .",

    "some general trends found in these studies concerning to the isotropic ( i)-nematic ( n ) phase transition can be summarized as follows : ( i ) the polydispersity dramatically widens the region of i - n two - phase coexistence , i.e. the density gap between the cloud and shadow points is considerably enlarged making this transition strongly of first order . ( ii ) there exists strong fractionation in sizes between coexisting phases from which small and large particles usually populate the i and n phases respectively .",
    "the above mentioned experimental and theoretical works were conducted on three - dimensional systems , however the effect of polydispersity on two - dimensional liquid - crystals has been scarcely explored @xcite .",
    "an experimental realization of a quasi 2d liquid - crystal system , apart from that already pointed out before , can be obtained by vertically shaking a monolayer of granular rods .",
    "recent experiments on these monolayers showed the presence of liquid - crystal textures as stationary states @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies on 2d monodisperse hard rods have shown that the transition from the high density n phase ( without long range orientational order ) to the low - density i phase is continuous , via a kosterlitz - thouless disclination unbinding type mechanism @xcite , rather than first order @xcite .",

    "experiments on a monolayer of disks standing on edges observed the conventional kosterlitz - thouless transition from i to n with almost smectic behavior at high density .",
    "but on the isotropic side of i - n transition an unusual regime of short - range t correlations dominates over n ones @xcite .",
    "recent experiments on monolayers of hard microscale square platelets showed a phase transition between an hexagonal rotator crystal and a rhombic crystal as the packing fraction is increased @xcite .",

    "shaken monolayers of granular cubes @xcite and cylinders @xcite exhibit stationary textures with strong t ordering even for aspect ratios of cylinders as large as 7 .",
    "all these studies show the profound effect that particle shapes and pair interactions have on the symmetry of the orientationally ordered phases .",

    "now the n phase develops a well defined central peak at @xmath5 reflecting a high proportion of small rectangles with t - like ordering . again the shadow n phase exhibits slightly higher degree of n ordering and consequently a lesser proportion of small rectangles with t - like configurations .",
    "the coexisting t distributions [ see panel ( c ) ] has a periodicity of @xmath5 ( the central peak is of the same height as those located at 0 and @xmath35 ) reflecting the t symmetry : the system is invariant under rotations of @xmath5 .",
    "the cloud t phase has a higher degree of ordering than its shadow counterpart .    a better understanding of the degree of particle ordering at i - n coexistence can be reached through the calculation of the angular distribution function of species of a certain aspect ratio @xmath4 , @xmath108 , as defined by eq . ( [ meassure ] ) .",
    "it is expected that the n ( t ) ordering increases ( decreases ) with @xmath4 , an assertion well supported by the n distributions shown in fig .",

    "again the cloud distributions [ panel ( a ) ] reflect a higher ordering than their shadow counterparts [ panel ( b ) ] , a fact already pointed out before when we discussed the behavior of @xmath126 for @xmath127 .    the global ordering along the coexisting binodal and spinodal curves of the phase diagram , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , is calculated through the order parameters @xmath131 [ see eq .",
    "( [ ordering ] ) ] .",
    "these are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] as functions of @xmath0 . for large values of @xmath0 , not close enough to the",
    "i - n tricritical point , @xmath132 , the n order parameter @xmath133 along the i - n coexistence is relatively high and always above the t order parameter @xmath134 . obviously at the i - n",
    "tricritical point they both become zero . as @xmath0 decreases from @xmath132 the t and n order parameters increase , both reaching their maxima at slightly different values close to @xmath130 .",
    "just below @xmath130 a cross - over between @xmath133 and @xmath134 takes place .",
    "a slight decrease of @xmath0 from this cross - over gives @xmath135 , a clear sign of the presence of a secondary peak at @xmath5 in the angular distribution function .",
    "then the i - n transition is substituted by the t - n one and @xmath133 decreases to zero at the t - n tricritical point @xmath136 .",
    "the order parameter @xmath134 also decreases in a lesser extent up to the value shown with a grey circle ( the t - n tricritical point ) . from this point",
    "@xmath137 increases along the t - n spinodal up to its maximum allowed value 1 as @xmath104 while it decreases along the t - n coexistence binodal as @xmath0 is increased up to @xmath138 , the value corresponding to the end - critical point , where the i - t spinodal and the cloud binodal of the t@xmath112-n@xmath113 coexistence meet .",
    "the difference , @xmath139 , between the aspect ratios corresponding to those of the end - critical and tricritical points [ see the square symbols in ( a ) and ( b ) ] depends on which of the phases is considered to be the cloud one .",
    "when @xmath140 [ panel ( a ) ] , i.e. for the ( i , t)@xmath113-n@xmath112 coexistence , this difference is clearly larger than that corresponding to @xmath141 , the ( i , t)@xmath112-n@xmath113 coexistence [ panel ( b ) ] .",
    "this behaviour is related to the already discussed fact on the possible existence of a triple i - n - t coexistence [ see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) ] for values of mean aspect ratios located between these points .",
    "this section is devoted to explore in detail the fractionation of different species between the coexisting phases . to this purpose",
    "we have fixed the values of the mean aspect ratio @xmath0 to one of the values of the following set : @xmath142 .",
    "also we have selected the polydisperse coefficient of the schulz - type ( @xmath3 ) distribution function to be @xmath119 as before .",
    "further , we numerically solved the eqs .",
    "( [ set3 ] ) and ( [ mech ] ) for chemical and mechanical equilibrium between cloud - shadow coexisting phases . as a result we found the normalized length - distributions , @xmath117 , obtained from ( [ plotear1])-([plotear2 ] ) for the shadow i , t or n phases .",
    "we should bear in mind that the cloud phases always follow the distribution @xmath18 .",
    "all these distributions are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "we can appreciate a clear fractionation of small / long species between cloud - shadow phases .",
    "the small ones preferentially populate the i or t phases while the n phase is rich in long species : see how the maxima of the i / t distributions are clearly located left of those of the n distributions .",
    "also the latter has a slower decay , indicating a higher fraction of long species . as we can see from the figure the fractionation is much more dramatic for @xmath130 which it is clearly correlated with the value at which the n phase has the highest order parameter @xmath133 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . as we move away from this value in the directions of both tricritical points @xmath143 the system exhibits fractionation but in a lesser extent due to the weaker character of the ( i , t)-n phase transition .    another important consequence of the fractionation is related to the values of the unit - less moments of the distribution functions , @xmath144 , at coexistence .",
    "in fig . [ fig7 ] we plot these moments as a function of @xmath145 for @xmath3 , @xmath130 and @xmath119 .",
    "the inequalities @xmath146 and @xmath147 are always fulfilled which constitutes a direct consequence of how different are the shapes of @xmath148 and @xmath149 as discussed previously .",
    "integrating the sharpest , strongly decayed function @xmath150 , over @xmath4 for @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) gives us a value of @xmath153 ( @xmath154 ) greater ( less ) than that obtained from the integration of the slower decaying function @xmath155 .",
    "to finish this section we present in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] how @xmath156 ( the averaged aspect ratio with respect to the coexisting shadow distribution @xmath117 ) evolves as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath119 .",
    "as expected , this average , which directly measures the fractionation , becomes equal to @xmath0 at both tricritical points ( solid circles ) while it reaches its maximum ( minimum ) value at @xmath157 when averaged with respect to n@xmath113 ( i@xmath113 ) distributions .",
    "this qualitative behavior is similar for both , the schulz ( @xmath3 ) and gaussian - tailed ( @xmath19 ) distributions .",
    "however the latter provokes less fractionation .",
    "to finish the discussion on fractionation we present in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] the results regarding the behaviour of the dimension - less zeroth moments , @xmath158 , of coexisting cloud and shadow phases as a function of polydispersity for fixed @xmath130 [ ( a ) ] and 7 [ ( b ) ] and selecting @xmath18 to be of schulz type ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we observe a dramatic widening of the coexistence region , i.e. the gap between the moments corresponding to i@xmath112 and n@xmath112 phases ( solid lines ) greatly increases with @xmath1 ( for @xmath159 the same occurs but beyond the tricritical point ) .",
    "also , for @xmath130 and zero polydispersity the moments of the shadow i and n phases ( dashed lines ) obviously coincide with those of the cloud phases and they compare as usually : @xmath160 .",
    "however as @xmath1 increases they exhibits a cross - over at @xmath161 and the former relation inverts : @xmath146 .",
    "this in turns means that the i shadow distribution function @xmath162 ( that which it is not normalized ) exhibits , as a result of strong fractionation , a sharper peak located at relatively small values of @xmath4 . on the other hand",
    "the n shadow distribution , @xmath163 , shows a more smeared peak located at larger values of @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "these differences in the shapes of distributions result in @xmath164 .",
    "interestingly this cross - over does not exist for @xmath159 : at the tricritical point the moments are equal while beyond it the fractionation mechanism always gives @xmath146 .",
    "a more clear measure of fractionation , given by @xmath165 , is plotted as a function of @xmath1 along the same shadow curves in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "for @xmath130 ( 7 ) the aspect ratio , averaged with respect to the shadow",
    "n ( i ) distribution , can reach values as large ( low ) as @xmath166 ( @xmath167 ) for high enough @xmath1 , a clear sign of the presence of strong fractionation .",
    "the last study we have carried out concerns the location of the i - n tricritical point as a function of polydispersity . to this purpose we fixed the value of @xmath0 and calculated the i@xmath113-n@xmath112 coexistence for high enough values of @xmath1 [ selected in such a way to guarantee a first order i - n transition , and thus to find a nontrivial numerical solution of eqs .",
    "( [ set3 ] ) ] .",
    "then we gradually decrease the value of @xmath1 and used as new initial guesses those found in the previously converged iterations .",
    "this process is repeated up to that value of @xmath1 for which the order parameter @xmath133 is negligibly small .",
    "finally an accurate extrapolation ( using a cubic - spline fitting ) of @xmath133 to zero gives us the value @xmath168 at which the first order transition becomes of second order , i.e. the position of the tricritical point .",
    "this process was carried out for a set of aspect ratios and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .",
    "the open circles show our selected values of @xmath0 and the curve is an akima spline fitting to guide the eyes .",
    "this curve has certain credibility only as an interpolation fitting .",
    "however we have decided to use the same fitting to conjecture the value of @xmath168 in the limit @xmath169 .",
    "this result might indicate that there exists a terminal polydispersity , around the value of @xmath170 , beyond which the i - n transition becomes of first order for any @xmath0 .",
    "we will certainly solve this conjecture by performing a bifurcation analysis around the tricritical point in such a way to find an analytic expression for @xmath168 as a function not only of @xmath0 but also of higher moments of the distribution @xmath171 .",
    "we will carry out this study in the future and we are planning to generalize it for any particle shape ( polydisperse hard discorectangles , hard ellipses , etc . ) .",
    "in such a way we will be able to shed some light on the character ( second vs. first ) of the i - n transition that mean - field theories predict for different polydisperse particle shapes .",
    "we have extended the spt of hr fluid from its multicomponent version to consider a continuous length - polydispersity . using this formalism",
    "we derived a simplified coexistence equations by using the fourier expansions of the angular moment profiles .",
    "the numerical solution of the obtained set of equations for the fourier components and for different values of the mean aspect ratio and polydispersity allowed us to obtain the phase diagram of the system .",
    "we have not taken any functional ansatz to parameterize the density profile .",
    "thus our calculations are exact up to the errors associated with the truncation of the fourier series .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows : ( i ) the i - n transition becomes stronger with polydispersity , i.e. the coexistence gap becomes wider and the tricritical point moves to higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "( ii ) the stability of the t phase slightly decreases with @xmath1 .",
    "( iii ) there exists strong fractionation between the coexisting phases which becomes stronger at @xmath157 and decreases as we approximate the t - n or i - n tricritical points .",
    "the fractionation for a schulz - type parent distribution function is stronger than that obtained for a gaussian - tailed distribution . as usually the n phase is rich in long particles while the i or t phases are highly populated by the smaller particles .",
    "( iv ) the orientational ordering of coexisting species of different @xmath4 is in general different : the small species , those with @xmath172 , have a low orientational ordering and tend to align in t - like configurations while long species contribute to stabilize the uniaxial n. this effect is more pronounced for @xmath157 .",
    "( v ) the locations of tricritical points are severely affected by polydispersity and our results might suggest the existence of a terminal polydispersity beyond which the i - n transition becomes of first order .",
    "we require further calculations to definitively settle out this point .",
    "a recent experiment on magnetic polydisperse nanorods which are strongly confined between lamellar layers ( an experimental realization of a quasi-2d hard - rod fluid ) shows a first order i - n transition with the n director being parallel to the plane of the layers @xcite .",
    "as we show in the present work when the polydispersity is high enough the character of the i - n transition could change from second to first order .",
    "thus the polydispersity could explain the experimental results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have not considered the presence of non - uniform phases ( like smectic or crystal ) in the present study . for low polydispersity",
    "they become stable at high densities . however when polydispersity increases",
    "they rapidly destabilize so the results shown here , specially those obtained for high enough @xmath1 , could be qualitatively confirmed by experimental realizations of a 2d hard - rectangular fluid .",
    "one of them could be mechanically vibrated monolayers of granular cylinders .",
    "recent experiments on such systems have confirmed the presence of strong t , n @xcite and smectic @xcite ordering of rods , which strongly depends on the aspect ratio and packing fraction . our group will conduct experiments on shaken monolayers of granular rods to study the effect of length - polydispersity on the stability of those liquid - crystal textures already found in the one - component case @xcite .",

    "<S> also we study the character ( second vs. first order ) of the isotropic - nematic phase transition as a function of polydispersity . </S>",
    "<S> we particularly focused on the stability of the tetratic phase as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the isotropic - nematic transition becomes strongly of first order when polydispersity is increased : the coexisting gap widens and the location of the tricritical point moves to higher values of @xmath0 while the tetratic phase is slightly destabilized with respect to the nematic one . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained here can be tested in experiments on shaken monolayers of granular rods .    </S>",
