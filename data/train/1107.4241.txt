    "the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability is an important instability in almost any system involving fluids : it can occur anywhere that has a velocity shear . in astrophysical plasmas the kh instability can provide the means of producing turbulence in a medium or the mixing of material between two boundary layers .    the kh instability has been studied in a variety of astrophysical systems , from solar winds @xcite and pulsar winds @xcite to thermal flares @xcite . due to its ability to drive mixing and turbulence , the kh instability has been considered relevant in protoplanetary disks @xcite , accretion disks and magnetospheres @xcite , and other jets and outflows @xcite . generally speaking , the assumptions of ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) have been used in order to simplify the system of equations to be solved .",
    "these assumptions are , however , not always valid .",
    "weakly ionised plasmas , for example , contain a large fraction of neutral particles as well as a number of charged particle fluids with differing physical characteristics .",
    "interactions between the various species can introduce non - ideal effects .",
    "ambipolar dissipation and the hall effect are two non - ideal effects that can greatly influence the development of the kh instability in a system by altering the dynamics of the plasma and the evolution of the magnetic field .",
    "astrophysical examples of such weakly ionised systems include dense molecular clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and accretion disks around young stellar objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these systems ,",
    "the relevant length scales are such that non - ideal effects can play an important role @xcite .",
    "many authors have investigated the role of the kh instability in both magnetised and unmagnetised astrophysical flows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of these studies have investigated the kh instability in the context of either hydrodynamics or ideal mhd .",
    "we know that non - ideal effects are important in molecular clouds at length scales below about 0.2pc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hence it is of interest to explore the kh instability in the context of either non - ideal mhd or , preferably , fully multifluid mhd . in more recent years",
    "the emphasis of kh studies has been on including non - ideal effects .",
    "@xcite studied both the linear growth and subsequent nonlinear saturation of the kh instability using resistive mhd numerical simulations .",
    "the inclusion of diffusion allowed for magnetic reconnection and non - ideal effects were observed through tearing instabilities and the formation of magnetic islands .",
    "@xcite also carried out a series of simulations using resistive mhd .",
    "they found that , following its initial growth , the kh instability decays at a rate that decreases with decreasing plasma resistivity , at least within the range of of resistivities accessible to their simulations .",
    "they also found that magnetisation increases the efficiency of momentum transport , and that the transport increases with decreasing resistivity .",
    "@xcite examined the case of a partially ionised dusty plasma , using a multifluid approach in which collisions could be included or ignored .",
    "they found that collisions between the neutral fluid and dust particles could lead to the stabilisation of kh modes of particular wavelengths .",
    "the unstable modes led to a significant local amplification of the magnetic field strength through the formation of vortices and current sheets . in the nonlinear regime",
    "they observed the magnetic flux being redistributed by magnetic reconnection .",
    "it was suggested that this could be applicable to dense molecular clouds and have important implications for the magnetic flux loss problem @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive study was carried out by @xcite which demonstrated the effect of dealing with the plasma using a multifluid scheme .",
    "this study focused on the effect of varying the properties of the dust grains .",
    "the results of the simulations led to the conclusions that more massive dust grains have a stabilising effect on the system while higher charged numbers have a destabilizing effect .",
    "it was found that there is no significant dependence on the charge polarity of the dust .    in a linear study of stellar outflows",
    "@xcite described how the charged and neutral fluids are affected differently by the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "this study is carried out using parameters chosen to reflect those of molecular clouds , and so is particularly relevant to our own study .",
    "the principal result of this paper is that for much of the relevant parameter space , neutrals and ions are sufficiently decoupled that the neutrals are unstable while the ions are held in place by the magnetic field .",
    "since the magnetic field is frozen to the ionised plasma , it is not tangled by the turbulence in the boundary layer .",
    "the authors predict that with well - resolved observations , there should be a detectably narrower line profile in ionised species tracing the stellar outflow compared with neutral species , since ionised species are not participating in the turbulent interface with the ambient interstellar medium .",
    "the paper also includes a study of the growth rate of the instability .",
    "it is found that at short length scales , the growth rate is well approximated by the growth rate of the hydrodynamic system . at larger scales and for super - alfvnic flows , the fastest growing mode is equal to that of the ideal mhd case .",
    "@xcite carried out an analytical study of the kelvin - helmholtz instability in dusty and partially ionised outflows .",
    "they investigated primarily the effect of the presence of dust particles by varying their mass , charge and charge polarity .",
    "it was found that as the charge of the grain increased , the growth timescales also increased , implying a stabilising effect on the system .",
    "the stability of the system was also examined for dependence on the mass of the dust particles .",
    "it was found that for stronger magnetic fields , this did not affect the stability of the system . however , for weaker magnetic fields , the larger dust particles had a stabilising effect on the growing modes .",
    "this was in agreement with previous laboratory experiments @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "finally , as the magnetic field strength increased , the growth timescale of the unstable modes at a particular perturbation wavelength decreased . by examining the combinations of the wavelength of the perturbation used , and the resultant growth timescales of the instability ,",
    "@xcite concluded that the kelvin - helmholtz instability is a possible candidate for causing the formation of some of the physical structures observed in molecular outflows from young stars .",
    "in this paper we perform numerical simulations of the complete evolution of the kelvin - helmholtz instability in a weakly ionised , multifluid plasma including both its linear development , saturation and its subsequent behaviour .",
    "we include the physics of the hall effect , ambipolar diffusion and parallel resistivity in these simulations and we analyse the role each of the former two effects on the development of the instability .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate the influence of multifluid effects on the growth and saturation of the kh instability . in order to develop a full understanding of the roles of the various non - ideal effects , in particular the hall effect and ambipolar diffusion , we run simulations with parameters chosen to simulate very high , medium and very low magnetic reynolds number systems and with parameters chosen to ensure ambipolar - dominated flows and hall - dominated flows .",
    "we focus on gaining an understanding of the general characteristics of the kh instability in weakly ionised flows .",
    "a detailed study of this instability in the specific context of molecular clouds , and which is of interest from the point of view of turbulence generation by stellar outflows , is the subject of a future work .    in section [ sec : num - app ]",
    "we outline the numerical and physical model employed , in section [ sec : analysis ] we discuss how we analyse the results of our simulations while in section [ sec : results ] we detail the results in both the linear and non - linear regimes , separating out the effects of ambipolar diffusion and the hall effect in order to more fully understand the influence of each .",
    "the simulations described in this work are performed using the hydra code @xcite for multifluid magnetohydrodynamics in the weakly ionised regime .",
    "we further assume the flow is isothermal .",
    "the assumption of weak ionisation allows us to ignore the inertia of the charged species and allows us to derive a ( relatively ) straightforward generalised ohm s law .",
    "the resulting system of equations , given below , incorporates finite parallel , hall and pederson conductivity and is valid in , for example , molecular clouds . in such regions",
    "the viscous lengthscales are much smaller than those over which nonideal effects are important .",
    "this leads to high prandtl numbers and plasma flows in these regions can be considered to be effectively inviscid . in this work",
    "we examine low mach number flows which , taken in concert with the isothermal assumption , means that features in the flow such as shocks are unlikely to create regions of high ionisation .",
    "the hydra code solves the following equations for a system of @xmath0 fluids .",

    "a transonic flow is chosen with sonic mach number @xmath65 , so that the plasma has velocity @xmath66 . in order for the kh instability to grow , it is required that the flow be super - alfvnic @xcite , and so for this study , an alfvn mach number @xmath67 is chosen .",

    "we then go on to discuss the behaviour of the kh instability in ambipolar - dominated and hall - dominated flows respectively .      in order",
    "first to validate our set - up we examine our mhd - zero - hr simulation with hydra and determine the growth rate using the kinetic energy of motions in the @xmath40 direction as described in sect .",

    "this growth is clearly exponential and can be fitted with a line of slope 2.63 implying a growth rate , normalised by the width of the shear layer and the initial relative velocity , for the dominant mode of the kh instability of 0.1315 .",
    "we can compare this with the value of the growth rate calculated analytically by @xcite ( their figure 4 ) at this wavenumber of 0.13 .",
    "while comparisons between linear studies of incompressible flows , and numerical studies of compressible flows are bound to differ to some extent , these results are seen to agree exceptionally well .",
    "we wish to examine not only the linear regime but also the non - linear regime .",
    "we compare our results for the growth of magnetic energy with those of @xcite ( the upper panel of their figure 5 ) .",

    "the maximum magnetic energy reached in our simulations matches that of @xcite to within 10% .",
    "our simulation reaches saturation at a later time but the exact time of saturation depends on the initial amplitude of the perturbation and so this is not a concern .",
    "we are therefore confident of the behaviour of hydra in simulating the kh instability .",
    "we now move on to investigating the influence of multifluid mhd effects on the growth , saturation and non - linear behaviour of this instability .",
    "we begin our study of the multifluid kh instability by choosing our fluid parameters to ensure our ambipolar resistivity is dynamically significant while minimising the hall resistivity .",
    "this allows us to isolate the influence of the ambipolar resistivity on the instability .",
    "in order to increase the ambipolar resistivity we change the value of the collision coefficient for species 2 so that @xmath94 is decreased by 3 orders of magnitude from that given in table [ table : mf - params ] for simulation ambi - med - hr and by 4 orders of magnitude for ambi - high - hr .",
    "these alterations of @xmath94 give values of @xmath73 of @xmath81 and @xmath77 respectively , and ( ambipolar ) magnetic reynold s numbers , @xmath95 , of @xmath96 and @xmath97 respectively .",
    "these simulations are examined in comparison to the full - low - hr simulation . with a formal magnetic reynolds number @xmath98 , the diffusion in this set - up is predominantly numerical , and as such",
    ", it is effectively an ideal mhd simulation .",
    "in non - ideal mhd we must ensure that the length scales over which the diffusion of the magnetic field ( or the whistler waves in the case of hall dominated flows ) must be resolved in order to properly track the dynamics of the system . to this end",
    "we perform a resolution study using simulations ambi - high - lr , ambi - high - mr and ambi - high - hr ( see table [ table : nomenclature ] ) .",
    "figures [ fig : ambi - res - ek ] and [ fig : ambi - res - eb ] contain plots of the evolution of @xmath88 and @xmath99 for each of the simulations in our resolution study .",
    "it can be seen that the linear growth in ambi - high - lr is significantly lower than the two other simulations . however , the linear behaviour is almost identical for ambi - high - mr and ambi - high - hr .",
    "the subsequent non - linear behaviour is similar with only relatively small variations after @xmath100 .",
    "but for the perturbed magnetic energy.,width=317 ]    the results of this study indicate that a resolution of @xmath79 is sufficient to capture the initial growth and saturation of the instability .",
    "subsequently , the dynamics is captured at least qualitatively .      generally speaking",
    ", the evolution of the kh instability in ideal mhd leads to a wind - up of both the plasma and the magnetic field at the interface between the two fluids , resulting in the `` kelvin s cat s eye '' vortex .",

    "the magnetic field is wound up in a similar fashion to the velocity in the upper panel , but not the lower panel.,title=\"fig:\",width=317 ]    given these striking differences at saturation it is interesting to investigate whether the linear growth rate is influenced by the addition of ambipolar diffusion .",
    "figure [ fig : ambi - ek ] contains plots of the evolution of @xmath88 with time for the various simulations .",
    "the linear growth rate remains almost unchanged with the addition of ambipolar diffusion .",
    "on the other hand , figure [ fig : ambi - eb ] contains plots of @xmath103 as a function of time .",
    "it is clear that the perturbed magnetic energy is strongly influenced , even well before saturation , by the presence of ambipolar diffusion .",
    "we will discuss this in more detail in section [ sec : ambi - nonlinear ] .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : ambi - eb ] that the magnetic energy is strongly influenced by the presence of ambipolar diffusion .",
    "this is not too surprising as ambipolar diffusion , being a genuinely diffusive process ( unlike the hall effect ) allows the magnetic field to diffuse relative to the bulk flow . as the collision rate between the ion and neutral fluids",
    "is decreased , the ion fluid decouples from the bulk fluid , and thus the magnetic field becomes decoupled from the bulk flow : the frozen - in approximation of ideal mhd is broken . as a result ,",
    "the magnetic field is able to diffuse through the bulk fluid rather than being tied to it . in figure",
    "[ fig : ambi - eb ] , diffusion can be identified as the cause of the decrease of the amplification of the magnetic energy with time for increasing ambipolar resistivity .",
    "a cursory examination of the topology of the magnetic field for the low resistivity case ( full - low - hr in figure [ fig : b - field - comp ] ) demonstrates clearly that there are regions in the flow which will be susceptible to diffusion : regions in which the magnetic field lines have been compressed and amplified .",
    "it is clear , again from figure [ fig : ambi - eb ] , that there is a significant decrease in the growth of magnetic energy as a result of diffusion for even a moderate amount of ambipolar resistivity .",
    "the diffusion has an influence on the dynamics of the neutral fluid : when the magnetic energy has not been as strongly amplified , the field can no longer exert the same effect on the neutral and ion fluid .",
    "examination of figure [ fig : ambi - ek ] reveals that the peak reached by @xmath88 _ increases _ with increasing ambipolar resistivity .",
    "the value reached tends toward the hydrodynamic limit for two reasons : increasing resistivity implies increasing diffusion and hence a decreasing field strength , and it also implies less coupling between the magnetic field and the neutral fluid with increasing resistivity . as expected , the weaker magnetic field strength allows the vortex to become more rolled up @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that for the ambi - med - hr simulation , the increase in the wind - up of the bulk fluid is due solely to the first source : the magnetic diffusion .",
    "the slight decoupling of the ion and neutral fluid is sufficiently high to allow magnetic diffusion , while still being sufficiently low to force the charged fluids to behave in a manner similar to the bulk fluid .",
    "this can be seen in a plot of the transverse kinetic energy of the ion fluid , as shown in figure [ fig : ambi - ek - ion ] . with moderate amounts of ambipolar diffusion , the transverse kinetic energy of the ion fluid ( and electron fluid ) reaches a higher maximum , meaning that the fluid experiences more wind - up .",
    "however , as the ambipolar resistivity is increased further , the ion fluid becomes more decoupled from the neutral fluid , and is instead influenced primarily by the dynamics of the magnetic field .",
    "this significant decoupling occurs only for magnetic reynolds number lower than @xmath104 . as the magnetic field therefore undergoes less wind - up than before",
    ", so does the ion ( and electron ) fluid .",
    "this decrease in the winding - up of the charged fluid velocity field is the cause of the decrease in the transverse kinetic energy of the ion fluid , as is seen in ambi - high - hr in figure [ fig : ambi - ek - ion ] .",
    "we now turn our attention to the likely influence of the hall effect on the kh instability in multifluid mhd flows . in order to attain the resistivities we want ( see table [ table : nomenclature ] ) we reduce the charge - to - mass ratio of the ion fluid , causing its hall parameter to become smaller , causing the ion fluid dynamics to more closely resemble the bulk ( neutral ) fluid dynamics .",
    "the electrons are , however , still well - tied to the field lines and so a relative drift emerges between the ion and electron fluids leading to a current perpendicular to the magnetic field and hence the hall effect .      as in the ambipolar resistivity study",
    ", a resolution study is carried out to ensure that the small - scale non - ideal dynamics are captured .",
    "for this purpose , simulations are again run at three different resolutions ( see table [ table : nomenclature ] ) .",
    "these simulations are run with the highest level of hall resistivity to ensure that the smallest - scale dispersive effects are in place when examining whether they are sufficiently resolved .",
    "the inclusion of the hall term in the dispersion relation in principle allows for the introduction of waves with a signal speed which tends towards infinity as their wavelength tends towards zero .",
    "while the hall term is handled in the equations by the hydra code using the explicit hall diffusion scheme ( hds ) @xcite , the code naturally does not resolve these waves of vanishing wavelength .    as has been seen",
    ", the introduction of non - ideal effects does not tend to greatly influence the linear growth rate of the instability . as a result",
    ", the growth rate does not provide a good means of measuring convergence with increasing resolution .",
    "the nonlinear evolution of the transverse kinetic energy , @xmath88 is , however , strongly influenced by the non - ideal effects .",
    "we do not examine the evolution of the perturbed magnetic energy as , in the case of high hall resistivity , it no longer demonstrates a simple growth to an initial maximum .",
    "the evolution of the transverse kinetic energy for each simulation is plotted in figure [ fig : hall - res - ek ] .",
    "it can clearly be seen that the simulations have started to converge at higher resolutions . while there is a notable difference between the two simulations of lower resolution , the gap closes significantly in the comparison between the two simulations of higher resolution .",
    "in particular , the initial maxima of @xmath88 are almost identical in simulations hall - high - mr and hall - high - hr .",
    "we are , therefore , confident that the dynamics in the hall - hr are well resolved and that our conclusions as to the physical processes occurring are well - founded .",
    "figures [ fig : hall - ek ] and [ fig : hall - eb ] contain plots of @xmath88 and @xmath103 as a function of time for simulations hall - med - hr and full - low - hr . in the linear regime",
    ", the influence of the hall effect on the growth rate of the instability , and on the magnetic and kinetic energy in the system at saturation can be seen to be negligible .",
    "hence we can conclude that neither ambipolar diffusion nor the hall effect influence the energetics of the system in the linear regime .",
    "we expect the hall effect to re - orient the magnetic field out of the @xmath38-plane in which it resides at @xmath87 .",
    "figure [ fig : hall - eb - xy - z ] contains plots of @xmath103 , the perturbed magnetic energy in the @xmath38-plane and the perturbed magnetic energy in the @xmath42 direction as functions of time .",
    "it is clear that there is some growth of the magnetic field in the @xmath42 direction .",
    "interestingly , at saturation the magnetic energy in the @xmath38-plane is noticeably less than @xmath103 and yet the overall value of @xmath103 is the same as that derived from the full - low - hr ( i.e.  quasi - ideal mhd ) simulation .",
    "an interesting point to note about this is that , whereas it has been shown @xcite that the strength of the field _ in the direction of the initial flow _ is what is important in determining the effect of the magnetic field on the kh instability , here we can see that the strength of the field perpendicular to this plane appears to play a role also .",
    "-plane only ( dashed line ) and in the @xmath42-direction ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "while the maximum reached by the total magnetic energy is the same as in full - low - hr , the magnetic field has experienced some re - orientation into the @xmath42-direction.,width=317 ]      following the initial linear growth of the instability , the system experiences a period of transferring energy back and forth between the magnetic field and velocity field , as in full - low - hr ( see figure [ fig : eb - ek ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the amplitude of the oscillations - i.e.   the amount of energy being transferred between motion and the magnetic field - is larger in hall - med - hr than in full - low - hr .",
    "this may be due to re - orientation of the magnetic field out of the plane of the instability and hence a reduction in ( numerical ) reconnection .",
    "it is worth recalling here that the hall effect , although it appears similar to a diffusion term in the induction equation , is a dispersive effect which conserves magnetic energy .",
    "perhaps the most important difference between full - low - hr and hall - med - hr is that while the kinetic energy in the @xmath41-direction gradually tends towards a constant value in the low resistivity case , it continues to steadily decay in hall - med - hr .",
    "the conclusion is that in full - low - hr , the instability has completed its growth and is returning to a quasi - steady state . in hall - med - hr",
    "however , the instability is continuing to consume the parallel kinetic energy available to it and the instability undergoes a further stage of development as a result of the inclusion of the hall effect .    since the magnetic field gains a component in the @xmath42 direction in hall - med - hr due to the hall effect it is interesting to examine the behaviour of the kinetic energy in the @xmath42 direction also .",
    "figure [ fig : ek - ekz ] contains plots of the transverse kinetic energy and the kinetic energy in the @xmath42 direction ( i.e.  @xmath105 ) .",
    "clearly the transverse kinetic energy grows rapidly during the linear development of the instability but @xmath106 also grows and , eventually , even becomes larger than @xmath88 .",
    "figure [ fig : total - e ] contains plots of the total energy ( kinetic and magnetic ) in full - low - hr , hall - med - hr and hall - high - hr .",
    "somewhat surprisingly we find that the hall - med - hr simulation loses energy somewhat _",
    "faster _ than full - low - hr .",
    "this is , on the face of it , a little puzzling since the hall effect does not itself dissipate magnetic energy .",
    "if we consider the hall - high - hr simulation we find that the total energy is roughly constant - it behaves roughly the same as hd - zero - hr .",
    "in fact , the magnetic energy in the hall - high - hr simulation behaves qualitatively differently to the hall - med - hr .",
    "figure [ fig : eb - hall ] contains plots of the perturbed magnetic energy as a function of time for hall - high - hr , and full - low - hr .",
    "it is clear that something dramatic is happening in the hall - high - hr simulation . to gain insight into this , in figure [",
    "fig : eb - hall - high - z ] we plot the total perturbed magnetic energy and the magnetic energy in the @xmath38-plane and in the @xmath42-direction for simulation hall - high - hr .",
    "the growth of the magnetic field in the @xmath42 direction is significant , as we expect from a system with the hall effect .",
    "in fact , the growth of the magnetic field in the @xmath38-plane is faster in the hall - med - hr case .",
    "this is nt too surprising as , in order to increase the hall effect , the coupling between the electrons and the neutrals is much weaker than that between the ions and neutrals .",
    "hence , while the neutrals and ions generate the usual cat s eye vortex , the electrons ( and the magnetic field ) do not .",
    "figure [ fig : hall - neutral - ion - electron ] demonstrates these morphological differences between the various fluids .",
    "-direction ( dashed line ) with time for hall - med - hr .",
    "it can be seen that at later times , the growth of energy in the @xmath42-direction has become significant.,width=317 ]             -plane ( dashed line ) and in the @xmath42-direction ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "it can be seen that there is significant growth in the @xmath42-direction.,width=317 ]    -plane in hall - high - hr at time @xmath107 .",
    "it can be seen that the magnetic field does not undergo as much wind - up as is seen in the bulk velocity field ( upper panel of figure [ fig : hall - neutral - ion - electron]).,width=317 ]    ) .,title=\"fig:\",width=317 ] ) .,title=\"fig:\",width=317 ] ) .,title=\"fig:\",width=317 ]    furthermore , in the case of full - low - hr , the magnetic field in the @xmath38-plane grows to such an extent that it opposes further wind - up of the fluid in the vortex . in the hall - high - hr case",
    "this does not happen as magnetic energy is re - distributed to the @xmath42 component of the field which does not oppose this wind - up . hence the vortex is not destroyed in the non - linear regime in the hall - high - hr case .",
    "this is the main difference between the hall - med - hr and hall - high - hr simulations . in the non - linear regime , then , the ion fluid remains spinning in the kh vortex while the electron fluid remains tied to the magnetic field .",
    "this maintains a velocity difference between the electrons and ions which , in turn , causes the magnetic energy to be further re - distributed to the @xmath42 component . in this way",
    "the hall effect , if strong enough , introduces strong dynamo action into the kh instability .",
    "this dynamo behaviour , which is not possible in a 2.5d , ideal mhd system is made possible by the hall term introducing a handedness into the flow ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if we follow the dynamics further we find that the kh instability , in the presence of high hall resistivity does not saturate to a quasi - steady state as it does in , for example , the full - low - hr case .",
    "as the @xmath42 components of the current and magnetic field continue to grow , the hall effect now acts on the non - parallel currents and magnetic fields that have arisen between the @xmath42-directions and the @xmath38-plane .",
    "this has the result of re - orienting some of the magnetic field , and electron fluid flow , back onto the @xmath38-plane . during this process",
    "the electron fluid obtains a velocity away from the kh vortex , which results in a broader volume of plasma being disturbed .",
    "this feeds the continuous growth of the magnetic energy in the @xmath38-plane , and thus causes continuous growth of the electron transverse kinetic energy , as can be seen in figure [ fig : ek - electron ] . in this particular simulation ,",
    "the size of the simulation grid is set so that it provides a sufficiently large region of ordered flow that can be transformed into disordered flow during the time of the simulation .",
    "the instability will naturally saturate when it has exhausted the area of ordered flow available to it .        to summarise , through their strong decoupling from the magnetic field , the dynamics of the bulk fluid and ion fluid demonstrate behaviour very similar to that of hd - zero - hr in which the kh vortex remains intact .",
    "the high hall case can in fact be thought of as two separate systems occurring simultaneously ; the bulk fluid demonstrating hydrodynamic behaviour and the continuously widening volume of perturbed fluid perpetually feeding the growth of the magnetic field through the hall effect .",
    "these two systems are intrinsically entwined through the requirement of charge neutrality , by which the electron fluid causes a widened area of perturbed ion fluid , and thus the bulk fluid .",
    "both systems are relatively energy efficient and , following the initial growth of the kh instability , the overall system experiences little further loss of energy .",
    "the supply of energy to feed the magnetic field is limited only to the physical size of the computational domain over which the simulation is run .",
    "this dynamo action occurs only under certain conditions .",
    "as the initial hall resistivity is increased from moderate to high , the electron fluid , and thus the magnetic field , becomes increasingly decoupled from the neutrals . as a result",
    ", the neutral fluid tends toward hydrodynamic behavior .",
    "this dynamo action is observed only when the hall resistivity is increased to a sufficiently high value that the kh vortex formed by the neutral fluid is no longer constrained by the magnetic field . unlike the pure hydrodynamic case , the presence of charged fluids undergoing different dynamics leads to the dynamo action observed .",
    "if the hall resistivity is not sufficiently large , the magnetic field eventually leads to the destruction of the kh vortex in the neutral fluid through reconnection as in the ideal mhd case .",
    "even a moderate amount of hall resistivity results in a wider volume of fluid being disturbed by the instability .",
    "this agrees with previous studies of the hall effect on the kh instability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the re - orientation of the magnetic field lines within the kh instability has also been observed in studies of mri in accretion disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite investigated a simple model of accretion disks without rotation and demonstrated that the combined actions of the shear instability and the hall effect leads to increased stretching of the magnetic field lines .",
    "this was shown to result in continued growth of the instability , which corresponds well to the dynamo action observed in our simulations with high hall resistivity .",
    "it is important to note , though , that studies by both @xcite and @xcite are linear studies and , as such , do not extend to the nonlinear regime of the instability .",
    "a more recent numerical study by @xcite demonstrates the twisting of magnetic field lines , but due to the inclusion of magnetic reconnection , does nt produce the magnetic dynamo observed here .",
    "we have presented the results of a suite of fully multifluid mhd simulations of the kh instability in weakly ionised fluids such as , for example , molecular cloud material . through varying the collision coefficients between the various charged species and the neutrals we were able to investigate systems",
    "in which ambipolar diffusion dominates the multifluid effects and ones in which the hall effect dominates .",
    "we validated our kh simulations through comparison of an ideal mhd simulation with previously published results and performed resolution studies for each of these cases to ensure that our conclusions are not unduly effected by our numerical resolution .",
    "our findings can be summarised as follows :    * the multifluid effects do not significantly influence the linear growth rate of the instability .",
    "* ambipolar diffusion dramatically reduces the energy associated with the perturbed magnetic field .",
    "this happens through diffusion for moderate ambipolar resistivity , but through both diffusion and decoupling of the magnetic field from the bulk flow for higher resistivity .",
    "* the hall effect , as expected , rotates the magnetic field out of the initial @xmath38-plane . *",
    "in contrast to both ambipolar dominated and ideal mhd flows , the hall effect causes the system to fail to settle to a quasi - steady state after saturation of the instability . * for moderate hall resistivity the perturbed magnetic field contains higher energy than in the ideal mhd case , presumably due to a field topology which impedes ( numerical ) reconnection . * for high hall resistivity strong dynamo action is seen as energy associated with the magnetic field grows without any apparent signs of saturation .",
