    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is the most copious of all the isotropic backgrounds observed from radio to gamma rays .",
    "it has become the most important observational tool both for determining the global cosmological parameters and to understand the physics of the early universe .",
    "the concordant model of cosmology that has emerged from recent observations is the inflationary @xmath0cdm model .",
    "this describes the universe as spatially flat with primordial fluctuations which are adiabatic and gaussian .",
    "the @xmath0cdm model has been quite successful in explaining many aspects of the universe conforming most with the observational data  . the primordial power spectrum formed during the inflationary epoch , in the simplest case",
    "can be described as a single inflaton field with a nearly scale - invariant harrison - zeldovich spectrum expressed as @xmath1 , ` @xmath2 ' being the comoving wavenumber .",
    "however , inflationary scenarios readily accommodate significant departures from scale invariance  .",
    "distortions in the shape of the initial power spectrum imprints characteristic scales on the form of @xmath3 .",
    "the amount of such distortions manifested on the angular power spectrum and the scales at which they occur are strictly related to the nature of the primordial fluctuations and to the matter content of the universe .",
    "careful analysis of all features of the cmb power spectrum put constraints on the entire parameter space . recently a lot of attention has been devoted to the power anomalies at low multipoles  @xcite compared to that obtained using the @xmath0cdm model of the universe .",
    "this was first reported by the cosmic background explorer ( cobe )  @xcite satellite and now further confirmed by wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) observations  . in the recent past many speculations",
    "have been made to provide a satisfactory explanation to this discrepancy but they have been successful only to a certain extent .",
    "the wmap team have crudely fit the power at low scales by putting a running spectral index to the nearly scale - invariant power law  @xcite .",
    "this aspect has also been projected as a probable new feature in the cmb anisotropies such as related to curvature scale  @xcite .",
    "this has been related to the topology of the universe as well , such as a dodecahedral universe  @xcite or possibly a violation of statistical isotropy  @xcite .",
    "a low quadrupole moment has been suggested to be originating also from dark energy , quintessence models with isocurvature perturbations   via correlations with adiabatic density fluctuations which lower the adiabatic integrated sachs - wolfe contributions to the quadrupole .",
    "even model - independent searches have been made to look for features in the cmb power spectrum  .",
    "the studies where the power spectrum has been reconstructed in a set of bins in k - space have the obvious disadvantage that the reconstruction depends on the width and the placement of the bins .",
    "this is also true for methods such as linear interpolation , wavelet , top - hat bins which can contribute to smoothening out or omission of features .",
    "despite the progress the issue of low scale power still remains a subject of debate .",
    "the most crucial point perhaps is the limited information available at large angular scales due to cosmic variance  @xcite .",
    "although large cosmic variance at the quadrupole does make the power discrepancy less significant , it is important to bear in mind that cosmic variance is proportional to the ` true ' angular power spectrum of the underlying model .",
    "the cosmic variance is small for a model that predicts the observed low quadrupole . in principle , the case for an infrared cutoff is best addressed by bayesian evidence study .",
    "however , different bayesian evidence studies for the models with infrared cutoff has yielded different conclusions regarding the evidence for an infrared cutoff in the primordial spectrum  @xcite .",
    "this is possibly due to the dependence of bayesian evidence analysis on the different class of models explored , details of parameterization of models and the datasets used .",
    "hence these results may not readily translate into a general conclusion on the evidence for ` infrared cutoff ' though  @xcite find that models with cutoff in power generally produce higher evidence compared to scale invariant or a single spectral index model .",
    "we revisit the possibility of explaining this observed suppression of power at low multipoles using known mechanisms of modifying the shape of the primordial power spectrum from inflation to introduce an infrared cutoff  .",
    "the limited success of model spectra with monotonic infrared cutoff studied is apparent from the non - monotonic infrared cutoff indicated by direct deconvolution of the primordial spectrum from the cmb angular power spectrum using wmap data  @xcite .",
    "the direct approach suggests that the data favours a sharp infrared cutoff followed by a localized excess ( ` bump ' ) . as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is not uncommon since mechanisms that produce a sharp change in amplitude ( such as required for the infrared cutoff ) can also have an overshoot followed by damped oscillations  @xcite . here , we focus on inflationary models with an infrared cutoff followed by a localized excess power ( referred to as ` bump ' ) in the power spectrum as a feasible possibility in explaining this deviation .",
    "this seems to be a promising avenue ( such as  @xcite ) .",
    "such features have also been seen by large - scale structure surveys  . we have carried out an exhaustive parameter estimation with such a class of primordial spectra using the bayesian approach by applying the _ markov chain monte carlo _ ( mcmc ) technique  @xcite .    in the sections to follow",
    "we first describe briefly in section ii , the various forms of primordial power spectra considered in this study .",
    "this is followed in section iii by a brief overview of the methodology adopted ( mcmc ) . in section",
    "iv we give the parameter estimates with such a class of primordial power spectra which is followed by the final section on discussion and conclusion .",
    "while reconstructing the initial conditions of the universe it is important to devise a method that can efficiently constrain the shape of the power spectrum of primordial matter density fluctuations .",
    "it has been shown in  @xcite that the direct recovery of the primordial power spectrum from the cmb ( wmap ) observations indicate a sharp infrared cutoff around the horizon scale ( @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the present horizon ) followed by a ` bump '  @xcite .",
    "the resulting angular spectrum gives a significantly better likelihood than a simple ( scale - invariant ) harrison - zeldovich , scale - free power spectrum and also a simple monotonic infrared cutoff .",
    "this motivates us to consider a broader variety of primordial power spectra with infrared cutoffs at low wavenumber arising from physics in the initial phase of a ( limited ) inflationary epoch .    in this section",
    "we describe such primordial power spectra with features which have been considered in this work and each model is motivated by some plausible inflationary scenario .",
    "[ pkplot ] shows the best fit spectra for the class of primordial power spectra considered below .      before we go on to describe initial power spectra with features we would like to mention the commonly assumed power law power spectrum ( referred to as ` power law ' model here )",

    "our results indicate that a larger value of @xmath12 is preferred .",
    "it was shown by starobinsky  @xcite that if the effective scalar inflaton potential has a ` singularity ' in the form of a sharp change in the slope ( a ` kink ' ) , it can create an infrared suppression in power spectrum of adiabatic perturbations at any chosen wavenumber @xmath14 ( referred to as starobinsky model here ) .",
    "the infrared cutoff is followed by the ` bump ' that arises naturally as the first peak of a damped ringing .",
    "the effect of a kink ( sharp change in the slope ) at some point of the inflaton potential can be neatly expressed in terms of the analytic multiplicative transfer function applied on the underlying power spectrum @xmath15 as    @xmath16    in the simpler form ( sb ) we restrict @xmath15 to be a simple power law . however , in general , @xmath15 can be of any form allowed by models of scalar field driven inflation .",

    "the difference of the vacuum in the kinetic domination ( fast rolling ) phase relative to the inflationary phase would imprint a feature in the power spectrum at large scales corresponding to first modes that crossed out of the hubble radius at the onset of inflation  @xcite .",
    "the feature is an infrared cutoff akin to that first shown by vilenkin and ford  @xcite for a radiation dominated pre - inflationary phase .",
    "if the scale corresponding to the current horizon exited the horizon very soon after the onset of inflation , then the feature could explain the observed suppression of power at the horizon scale .",

    "too , the current horizon scale crosses the hubble radius very close to the onset of inflation .      encouraged by the reasonable success of the class of primordial spectra described in the earlier subsections we have undertaken a power estimation with yet another form of initial spectra tailored to mimic the cutoff and the ` bump ' in the primordial power spectrum . as discussed earlier , the starobinsky feature is a transfer function that modulates an underlying power spectrum expected from the inflaton potential without singularity and affects any inflationary scenario based on a inflaton potential with sharp change in slope ( eq .  [ staro ] ) .",

    ". the very presence of a feature in the primordial spectrum indicates modification to the simplest inflationary scenarios and calls for an exploration of extensions based on plausible physical mechanisms .",
    "we show that sharp features , such as a infrared cutoff near the horizon scale and a ` bump ' , in the primordial power spectrum provides a likely explanation to power suppression at low multipoles as seen in the recent wmap data . although a steep monotonic cutoff tends to pull down the power in the next few higher multipoles above the quadrupole and octopole but this is well compensated by the sudden excess power following the sharp rise .",
