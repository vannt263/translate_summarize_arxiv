    "deharveng et al .",
    "( 2008 ) also argue that the claim to see such an effect may be due to small number statistics .",
    "this is the same argument as dijkstra et al .",
    "( 2007 ) propose .",
    "their simple sfr - based galaxy evolution model does not reproduce any correlation between uv flux and ly@xmath0 ew .",
    "in two recent publications , pflamm - altenburg et al . ( 2009 ) and meurer et al .",
    "( 2009 ) discuss how a varying imf can cause a decline in h@xmath0 luminosity , and thus the ews , at bright uv fluxes . even though it is unclear what the relation between ly@xmath0 and h@xmath0 is in the high redshift universe ,",
    "there should exist a correlation between the two fluxes , and hence this effect could potentially also cause the ly@xmath0 ew to decrease .",
    "pflamm - altenburg et al .",
    "( 2009 ) predict that this effect will take place at star formation rates below @xmath8  m@xmath9  yr@xmath10 . as surveys for high redshift galaxies are unable to reach these low star formation rates , this particular effect",
    "is not expected to be observable .",
    "given the large number of recent publications concerned with this issue , the number of proposed interpretations , and given that there still seems to be disagreement as to whether an effect is actually observed , we find it appropriate to subject the issue to a rigorous statistical test . in this paper",
    "we address _ if _ there is a dependency between the ly@xmath0 ew and uv luminosity ( or ly@xmath0 flux ) in observed , high redshift galaxy samples .",
    "we focus on results from @xmath11 ly@xmath0 emitter , and lyman - break galaxy , surveys as the amount of available , observational data is the largest at that redshift . section  [ sec : model ] describes the method used . the results are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] and a discussion of the results is found in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .    throughout this paper , we assume a cosmology with @xmath12 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the two observed parameters used here are the ly@xmath0 and uv fluxes of a galaxy . for simplicity , we choose to perform our tests on plots involving the ew of the galaxy ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : ewuv ] or fig .",
    "[ fig : ando ] ) .",
    "this is a simple coordinate transformation , according to : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the ly@xmath0 flux and @xmath17 is the flux density in the uv at the ly@xmath0 wavelength .",
    "the 1-d ew distributions for high redshift galaxies , averaged over large samples , have been shown to closely resemble an exponentially declining function ( gronwall et al .",
    "2007 , nilsson et al . 2009 ) : @xmath18 here the @xmath19 is a scaling constant that can be fitted for for each data - set .",
    "the suggestion that there may be a lack of high luminosity objects with high ews would then imply that @xmath19 , at any given redshift , must be a function of the luminosity in the sense that the ew distribution becomes narrower for high luminosity objects as the high ew tail of the distribution is truncated . in principle this is easy to test simply by dividing a sample of galaxies into luminosity bins and then ask if there is any evidence for a significant change of @xmath19 between the high and low luminosity sub - samples . in practice",
    "the expected number of objects in the high luminosity , high ew bin is too small to give a robust answer .",
    "instead , we introduce a potential dependence on the ew from the ly@xmath0/uv flux , allowing a monte carlo approach . to quantify the dependence , the parameter @xmath20 is introduced into",
    "the scaling constant according to : @xmath21 for ly@xmath0 emitters , where @xmath22 is the best fit scaling constant if @xmath23 and l@xmath24 is the ly@xmath0 luminosity in erg  s@xmath10 .",
    "for lyman - break galaxies , instead we have : @xmath25 where @xmath26 the constants in eq .",
    "[ eq : ewlae ] and [ eq : ewlbg ] are carefully chosen to allow a change in @xmath19 at the brightest end of the order @xmath27 when @xmath28 , and a change in the faintest end of the order a few  .",
    "these equations resolve into no dependence between ly@xmath0/uv flux and ew if @xmath29 and a large dependence when @xmath30 .",
    "a large positive @xmath20 will result in fewer objects with large ews at bright fluxes , and a large negative @xmath20 in an excess of large ew objects at bright fluxes .",
    "[ fig : ewuv ] illustrates the effect of @xmath20 on the ew - flux distribution .",
    "it is important to note that it is necessary to fit the two types of galaxies with different equations , because they are flux limited in different parameters ; ly@xmath0 emitters in ly@xmath0 flux and lyman - break galaxies in the uv flux .",
    "ideally , both galaxy samples would be fit with the same equation , with e.g. a dependency on only @xmath17 .",
    "this would , however , infer a flux dependent lower limit to the ew of the ly@xmath0 emitters , an effect which is clearly illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ando ] .",
    "because of this , we choose to fit ly@xmath0 emitters and lyman - break galaxies with separate equations and dependencies .    to test the value of @xmath20 , we make a simulated distribution of galaxies by drawing from 1-d distributions for the flux and the ew , with different values on @xmath20 , and test if the simulated galaxy distribution resembles the observed distribution .",
    "we do this in three steps .",
    "first we model the observed ew distribution , to find @xmath31 .",
    "the procedure to find the best fit @xmath20 then includes creating simulated ew@xmath32flux distributions of galaxies by drawing randomly from the ly@xmath0/uv luminosity functions and the exponentially declining ew distribution function according to eq .",
    "[ eq : ewexp ] and  [ eq : ewlae ] or  [ eq : ewlbg ] for different values of @xmath20 .",
    "the 1-d flux distributions we draw from are the observed respective ly@xmath0 and uv luminosity functions , summarised in table  [ tab : lfew ] . as this paper",
    "is focused on results at redshift three , the luminosity function is drawn from gronwall et al .",
    "( 2007 ) in the case of ly@xmath0 emitters .",
    "several other luminosity functions have been published but they all agree very well ( see also van breukelen et al . , 2005 , ouchi et al . , 2008 , grove et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "in the case of lyman - break galaxies we use the luminosity function of reddy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     percentages of objects in the quadrant with @xmath33 and ew@xmath34   .",
    "second column gives the percentages in the simulated samples with @xmath29 , third column in the observed samples used in this paper , and fourth column those of ando et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .    based on the results for the sample from shapley et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , there is a weak dependence between the ew and the uv flux , in the sense that there is a smaller fraction of high ew objects at brighter @xmath3 , but @xmath35 is only ruled out to @xmath36 , or @xmath37% . to confirm a real deficiency in objects in a quadrant",
    "would ideally require of the order 100 objects in that quadrant , in this case requiring a total sample of @xmath38 ly@xmath0 emitters or @xmath39 lyman - break galaxies with confirmed fluxes and ews .",
    "it is important to note that the analysis performed here was made at redshift @xmath40 as most of the data exists at this redshift .",
    "samples at redshifts @xmath41 are much smaller , and would produce a much weaker result .",
    "several other factors make the higher redshift range more unsuitable for this test .",
    "firstly , the measurement of the ew in very high redshift galaxies becomes very uncertain due to the increasingly faint uv continuum , in some cases resulting in lower limits on the measured ew .",
    "secondly , all line emission surveys , that are not spectroscopically confirmed , contain some fraction of low redshift interlopers .",
    "this fraction is expected to increase with increasing redshift ( c.f .",
    "kakazu et al .  2007 )",
    "it is also uncertain if some neutral gas still remains at @xmath5 , which could affect the measurements of ly@xmath0 ew / flux in unpredictable ways .",
    "for the sample studied here , at @xmath11 , these effects are not serious .",
    "until larger samples have been collected at either redshift ranges , no conclusion can be drawn on whether there is a lack of high - ew , uv bright galaxies in the universe .",
    "how can the @xmath20 parameter be interpreted ?",
    "a large positive @xmath20 would indicate that there are fewer galaxies with large ly@xmath0 ews at brighter uv fluxes .",
    "a large negative @xmath20 indicates that it is more likely to find large - ew uv - bright galaxies .",
    "the next question is then what could cause this inflation or deflation of the ew distribution in the brighter uv flux slices ? as ando et al .",
    "( 2006 ) argue , there could be several reasons for why there should be a dependence between these two measurable quantities .",
    "what is clear is that the time - scale on which the two quantities are sensitive to are different . the ly@xmath0 flux , and thus ew , is only large in the first @xmath42  myrs , assuming a single stellar population .",
    "the uv flux on the other hand can stay large for several hundred myrs . in each galaxy ,",
    "the uv and ly@xmath0 flux is integrated over several star forming regions with different time - scales , with more massive galaxies having more star forming regions .",
    "if a larger fraction of these regions are in or out of their their ly@xmath0 emitting phase , this could cause the ew distribution to inflate or deflate for uv - bright galaxies .",
    "dust , metallicity , halo mass , infall rate , star formation rate , gas dynamics , and detailed gas morphology are also ingredients which could easily work to modify @xmath19 .    in this paper",
    "we have searched for evidence of such an effect .",
    "we have done this in two ways .",
    "first we used a simple null - hypothesis of a single luminosity function and a constant @xmath19 for all luminosities . for a well defined sample of 232 ly@xmath0 emitters",
    ", the null - hypothesis predicts that 56 of those should be in the ( ew@xmath43   , @xmath33 ) section of parameter space .",
    "we find 72 , which is @xmath44 more than predicted by the simple model .",
    "this result is at variance with earlier suggestions that this section of the ew-@xmath3 plane is under - populated , if anything there might be marginal evidence that it is over - populated .",
    "second , in order to parametrize this analysis in a more global way , we defined a description of the equivalent width distribution which allows it to change as a function of ly@xmath0 luminosity via a parameter @xmath45 . following a monte carlo procedure we determined the best fit of a large number of random realizations to our sample and found @xmath46 .",
    "this means that in a global sense the @xmath45 parameter is consistent with zero for the entire sample , i.e. consistent with a constant @xmath19 .",
    "for the lyman - break galaxies , the results are similar , with @xmath47 consistent with zero within @xmath48 .",
    "it is of interest to ask how strong the limits set by this result are .",
    "we will use a simple comparison to set those limits into context . in a recent paper ( nilsson et al .",
    "2009 ) it was shown that @xmath19 is a function of redshift and that it has been found to drop from @xmath49   at @xmath50 to @xmath51   at @xmath52 , i.e. a change of @xmath53   . from eq .",
    "[ eq : ewlae ] we see that the most extreme effect , reducing the @xmath19 , occurs when @xmath45 is as largely positive as possible .",
    "if we then include @xmath54 , the upper envelope of the @xmath55 probability for the ly@xmath0 emitters , and compute what l@xmath24 corresponds to a shift in @xmath56   , we find that this happens at a minimum ly@xmath0 luminosity of @xmath57  erg  s@xmath10 , while 98.7% of the sample have smaller luminosities than this . in conclusion",
    ", our analysis has constrained the dependence of @xmath19 on the ly@xmath0 luminosity to be smaller than , or of the order of , the change observed as a function of redshift .",
    "the dependence - free case of @xmath29 found here is intriguing , as it means that the ly@xmath0 ew distribution is independent on the ly@xmath0 flux of ly@xmath0 emitters and the uv flux of lyman - break galaxies , and is then independent to all parameters governing these fluxes ( e.g. mass , age , metallicity , star formation rates etc . ) . in principle , the ew could still be correlated with the other respective parameter , i.e. the ew in ly@xmath0 emitters could be dependent on @xmath3 and vice versa , although the dependency between ly@xmath0 flux and @xmath3 in the galaxies would then have to be contrived .",
    "we consider such a scenario to be unlikely .",
    "the fact that our results are consistent with no dependence between ly@xmath0 ew and the uv flux means that effects of varying the imf , dust and age are not very important over the flux range that we probe in present day surveys of high redshift galaxies .",
    "that there is no age dependence indicates that the light observed from these galaxies is integrated over many star forming regions with varying ages .",
    "the analysis presented here would greatly improve by adding more samples of both types of high redshift galaxies , but especially a larger sample of spectroscopically observed lyman - break galaxies is necessary to finally draw any conclusions regarding the dependence between ly@xmath0 ew and uv flux in high redshift galaxies .",
