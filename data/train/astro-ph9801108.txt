    "from recent hst observations of a low - redshift ( @xmath1 ) absorption - line system toward the quasar q  1718 + 4807 ( @xmath4 ) webb _ et al . _",
    "( 1997a , b ) deduced d / h = @xmath5 .",
    "this ratio is significantly higher than that derived from other quasar spectra at @xmath3 [ d / h = @xmath6 by tytler & burles , 1996 ; d / h = @xmath7 by levshakov , kegel & takahara , 1997 ( lkt , hereinafter ) ] , and at @xmath8 [ d / h = @xmath9 by tytler _",
    "et al . _ , 1996 ; d / h @xmath10 by songaila _",
    "et al . _ ,",
    "1997 ] .",
    "the apparent spread of the d / h values leads some authors to assume fluctuations in the baryon - to - photon ratio at the epoch of bbn ( see e.g. webb _ et al .",
    "_ , and references cited therein ) . on the other hand",
    ", according to the basic idea of homogeneity and isotropy of big bang theory the _ primordial _ deuterium abundance should not vary in space .",
    "one can only expect that the d / h ratio decreases with cosmic time due to conversion of d into @xmath11he and heavier elements in stars . to check whether big bang nucleosynthesis has occurred homogeneously or",
    "not , precise measurements of absolute values of d / h at high redshift are extremely important .",
    "the fundamental character of this cosmological test requires an unambiguous interpretation of spectral observations .",
    "it is well known , however , that the physical parameters derived from spectral data depend on the assumptions made with respect to the line broadening mechanism . for intergalactic absorption lines a ` non - thermal broadening '",
    "is usually assumed to be caused by large scale motions of the absorbing gas .",
    "the commonly used microturbulent approach disregards all correlations of the velocity field , implying a symmetrical ( gaussian ) distribution of the velocity components parallel to the line of sight and a symmetrical line profile .",
    "actually , any turbulent flow exhibits an immanent structure in which the velocities in neighboring volume elements are correlated with each other .",
    "different aspects of the line formation processes in correlated turbulent media have been discussed recently in a series of papers by levshakov & kegel ( 1997 , lk hereinafter ) , levshakov , kegel & mazets ( 1997 , lkm hereinafter ) , and by lkt .",
    "once the statistical properties of a turbulent cloud have been specified , the way spectral lines ought to be calculated , depends on the problem considered . considering emission lines one is dealing with many lines of sight and the observed intensity should closely correspond to the theoretical expectation value ( see e.g. albrecht & kegel 1987 ) .",
    "if , however , one observes the absorption spectrum in the light of a point - like background source , the actually observed line profile is determined by the velocity distribution along the particular line of sight .",
    "therefore , the intensity may deviate substantially from the expectation value , since averaging along one line of sight corresponds to averaging over an incomplete sample ( for details see lk and lkm ) . for large values of",
    "the ratio of the cloud thickness @xmath12 to the correlation length @xmath13 the distribution function @xmath14 for the velocity component parallel to the line of sight approaches the statistical average , which has been assumed to be a gaussian . for values of @xmath15 of only a few ,",
    "however , @xmath14 may deviate substantially from a gaussian , and is asymmetric in general .",
    "this leads to a complex shape of the absorption coefficient for which the assumption of voigt profiles could be extremely misleading .",
    "the actual d / h ratio may turn out to be _ higher _ or _ lower _ than the value obtained from the voigt - fitting procedure .",
    "the present letter is primarily aimed at the inverse problem in the analysis of the h+d ly@xmath0 absorption observed by webb _",
    "( 1997a , b ) .",
    "the original analysis was performed in the framework of the microturbulent model .",
    "here we make an attempt to re - analyze the observational data on the basis of a more general mesoturbulent model .",
    "we consider a cloud with a stochastic velocity field with finite correlation length but of homogeneous ( hi- ) density and temperature .",
    "the velocity field is characterized by its rms amplitude @xmath16 and its correlation length @xmath13 .",
    "the model is identical to that of lkt . ",
    "the objective is to investigate whether the data in question may also be interpreted by a lower d / h ratio consistent with the values found for other absorption systems .",
    "to estimate physical parameters and an appropriate velocity field structure along the line of sight , we used a reverse monte carlo [ rmc ] technique ( see lkt ) .",
    "the algorithm requires to define a simulation box for the 5 physical parameters  : n(hi ) , d / h , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath15 ( here @xmath19 denotes the thermal width of the hydrogen lines ) . ",
    "the continuous random function of the coordinate @xmath20 is represented by its sampled values at equal space intervals @xmath21 , i.e. by @xmath22 , the vector of the velocity components parallel to the line of sight at the spatial points @xmath23 .    in the present study we adopted for the physical parameters the following boundaries  :    according to webb _ et al .",
    "_ , n(hi ) is well restricted within the range from 1.70@xmath24 @xmath25 to 1.78@xmath24 @xmath25 , as derived from the observed lyman - limit discontinuity .    for d / h",
    "we use the range from 3.0@xmath26 to 5.0@xmath26 , trying to find a low d / h solution .    to restrict @xmath17 and @xmath18 one has to assume a model for the absorbing material .",
    "it is generally believed that absorption line systems with n(hi ) @xmath27 @xmath25 arise in the halos of putative intervening galaxies .",
    "direct observations of galactic halos at @xmath28 ( van ojik _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) show that @xmath29 km s@xmath30 , if @xmath31 k. for @xmath17 we use the interval @xmath32 k , and , thus , @xmath18 may range within 1.3  4.3 .",
    "for @xmath33 the meso- and microturbulent profiles tend to be identical ( see lk )",
    "_ thoroughly investigated different microturbulent models .",
    "therefore we consider only moderate @xmath15 ratios in the range 1.0  5.0 .    following webb _",
    "( 1997b ) , we exclude the siiii line from our analysis of the h+d ly@xmath0 profile . as shown by vidal - madjar _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) , ` deducting lines of sight velocity structure for d / h evaluations from ionized species could be extremely misleading ' .",
    "but we fix @xmath34(siiii ) = 0.701024 as a more or less arbitrary reference radial velocity at which @xmath35 .",
    "having specified the parameter space , we construct the objective function ( lkt ) : @xmath36 ^ 2\\ , , \\label{eq : e1}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the simulated random intensity , @xmath38 the observed normalized intensity within the @xmath39th pixel of the line profile , @xmath40 the experimental error level , and @xmath41 the degree of freedom ( @xmath42 is the number of data points and @xmath43 is the number of fitted physical parameters , @xmath44 in our case ) .    here",
    "@xmath40 is assumed to be constant over the entire h+d profile . in order to estimate @xmath40",
    "we have chosen a portion of the q  1718 + 4807 continuum from the left ( @xmath45  ) and the right ( @xmath46  ) hand side of the hydrogen absorption ( see fig .  1 ) , as well as the bottom of the ly@xmath0 line ( @xmath47  ) .",
    "these three regions yield @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , respectively . at @xmath51 where the number density of the ly@xmath0 lines is far lower than at high redshifts ,",
    "the experimental noise is expected to be free from the contamination by weak ly@xmath0 forest lines .",
    "therefore the estimated noise level corresponds to the experimental uncertainties . to approximate the error level we set @xmath52 .",
    "finally , our objective function contains only the blue and the red wing of the hi line ( @xmath53   and @xmath54  , respectively ) since they are more sensitive to the parameter variations than the central part of the line is . by this",
    "we restrict the total number of data points to @xmath55 , implying @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the credible probability @xmath58 .",
    "the estimated parameters for a few adequate rmc profile fits ( @xmath59 ) are listed in table  1 . the derived deuterium abundance @xmath60 is about 47 times smaller than the limiting values of @xmath61 found by webb _",
    "( 1997b ) in the microturbulent model excluding the siiii line . to illustrate our results",
    ", we show in figs . 1 and 2 h+d ly@xmath0 profiles for the two calculations with the lowest and the highest d abundances found in the mesoturbulent model ( d / h = @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively ) .",
    "they are shown by the solid curve , whereas the open circles give the experimental intensities @xmath38 .    the residuals @xmath64/\\sigma_{\\rm noise}$ ] shown in figs .",
    "1*b * and 2*b * by filled circles are normally distributed with zero mean and unit variance ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "this fact , rather trivial in case of high s / n data , becomes crucial when dealing with spectra as noisy as the present one is , because of the probability to be trapped into fitting the noise features .",
    "the good concordance of the residuals with the expected normal distribution is here a significant argument for the validity of the results obtained .",

    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "1*c * and 2*c * where again open circles correspond to the observed intensities and the computed spectra are shown by the solid curves .",
    "we do not find any pronounced discordance of calculated and real spectra . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectral resolution of 2.95   is not sufficient to follow a fine velocity field structure within the @xmath1 absorber .",
    "the derived @xmath20-configurations are not unique .",
    "table  1 demonstrates the spread of the rms turbulent velocities from 18 up to 40 km s@xmath30 .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize once more that the projected velocity distribution function may differ considerably from a gaussian .",
    "4 shows an example of such distortions caused by a poor statistical sample ( i.e. incomplete averaging ) of the velocity field distributions for the two cases of the lowest and the highest d / h ratios from table  1 [ model ( e ) and ( c ) , respectively ] . both @xmath14 distributions are asymmetric",
    "this is the main reason why the absorption in the blue wing of the hi ly@xmath0 line may be enhanced without any additional hi interloper(s ) .",
    "we have shown that the interpretation of the hst and iue spectra obtained by webb et al . is not unique .",
    "the data can as well be modeled with a low value of the d / h ratio if one accounts for spatial correlations in the large scale velocity field .",
    "the rmc results may be tested , in principle , by additional observations of higher order lyman lines with the same spectral resolution as webb _",
    "used for ly-@xmath0 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath14 is asymmetric , this will show up in the profile shapes of the higher order lyman lines .",
    "for the physical parameters listed in table  1 , the effect becomes visible starting from ly-4 [ the ly-@xmath0 , -@xmath69 , -@xmath70 lines are insensitive to the asymmetry of @xmath14 due to their high optical depth ] .",

    "the line shapes clearly depend on the velocity field structure and are asymmetric in general .",
