    "the magnetic a and f stars have global magnetic fields with surface field strengths typically of a few kg to tens of kg .",
    "a subset of them , the rapidly oscillating ap ( roap ) stars , pulsate in high radial overtone magnetically distorted dipole and quadrupole modes with periods in the range @xmath3min ( see , e.g. , table  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "these stars thus offer the opportunity to observe the interaction of pmodes with strong magnetic fields as can be done for no other star but the sun .",
    "the kg - strength magnetic fields in sunspots dissipate energy in solar p - modes and shift their phases significantly , as is clearly seen in both observational and theoretical local helioseismology . while it is not possible to perform local asteroseismology in the same detail as for the sun  for obvious reasons of angular resolution ",
    "some unique properties of the roap stars have the potential to allow 3d mapping of their pulsation modes , magnetic field geometries and abundance distributions within the observable layers of their atmospheres , hence allow a detailed study of the interaction of the pulsations with the magnetic fields .",
    "the roap stars with very strong magnetic fields are of special interest because the effect of the magnetic field on the structure of their atmospheres can be studied with the greatest detail and accuracy .",
    "the cool roap star hd154708 possesses the strongest magnetic field among the roap stars , with a mean magnetic field modulus @xmath4 kg @xcite , which is about a factor of three greater than that of hd166473 , @xmath59.0 kg @xcite , the roap star with the second - strongest magnetic field . for all of the roap stars",
    "the pulsations observed in radial velocity variations of lines of the rare earth elements arise at atmospheric heights where the magnetic pressure exceeds the gas pressure and the alfvn velocity is greater than the acoustic velocity , so the pulsations are primarily magnetic with an acoustic component .",
    "there have been many theoretical investigations of the roap stars discussing , e.g. , mode conversion and reflection , contributions of horizontal and vertical motions to the observed pulsational radial velocities , and mode excitation and suppression in these stars ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "all of the theoretical models are for atmospheres with magnetic field strengths less than 10 kg .",
    "thus the discovery of pulsation in hd154708 in the presence of its 24.5-kg field charts new territory . with its field strength more than 15 times the 1.5 kg",
    "typically observed in sunspots , hd154708 by far shows the most extreme observable case of pulsation in the presence of a strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we thus wish to know as much about it as possible , and for obliquely rotating and pulsating ap stars it is imperative to determine their rotation periods and magnetic variations with rotation to extract important geometrical information .",
    "the atmospheric parameters of hd154708 , @xmath6k and @xmath7 , have been determined using the b2@xmath8 g temperature calibration of geneva photometry ( @xcite , eqn .  2 ) and",
    "the hipparcos parallax @xcite ; strmgren photometry @xcite suggests a hotter temperature , @xmath9k .",
    "the magnetic field in this star was discovered during our systematic study of magnetic fields in chemically peculiar ap and bp stars with the multi - mode instrument fors1 installed at the 8-m kueyen telescope @xcite . among the whole class of ap and bp stars , the only star known at that time to have a stronger dipolar magnetic field than hd154708 was the much hotter ( @xmath1014500k ; @xcite ) bp si star hd215441 ( babcock s star ) with a mean field modulus of @xmath11 kg @xcite .",
    "now @xcite have found a field of @xmath12 kg in hd75049 , making this the second - strongest dipolar field known among the upper main sequence chemically peculiar stars .",
    "the presence of pulsations with a period of 8min was discovered by @xcite using 2.5h of high time resolution uves ( ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph ) spectra .",
    "they found that the radial velocity amplitudes in the rare earth element lines of ndii , ndiii , and priii were unusually low , suggesting that roap stars with stronger magnetic fields have lower pulsation amplitudes .",
    "further study of the pulsation of hd154708 over its now - known 5.3666-d rotation cycle will illuminate this suggestion , as would theoretical studies of models with field strengths up to 30 kg .",
    "a recent abundance analysis of hd154708 was based on a high spectral resolution uves spectrum obtained on september 18 , 2005 @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric chemical composition of this star was shown to be typical of cool ap stars with a significant ionization disequilibrium for the first and second rare earth ions , which is commonly observed in the atmospheres of pulsating roap stars @xcite .",
    "the model atmosphere was calculated with the llmodels code @xcite .",
    "light elements , as well as ti , fe , and ni were found underabundant whereas sc and cr showed solar abundances .",
    "heavy elements and rare earth elements were strongly overabundant .",
    "ndiii is 0.86dex overabundant with respect to ndii and priii was overabundant by 1.11dex compared to prii .",
    "@xcite studied the presence of heavy ca isotopes in hd154708 using the infrared triplet lines of caii .",
    "they measured isotopic shifts of + 0.14 , + 0.26 , and + 0.29 for @xmath138498 , 8542 , and 8662 , respectively .",
    "however , the maximum isotopic shifts between the isotopes @xmath14ca and @xmath15ca for the caii triplet lines is of the order of 0.2 .",
    "possibly these differences are caused by other effects than isotopic shifts  most likely , blending with highly displaced zeeman components .",
    "the magnetic field of hd154708 is so strong that a number of spectral lines are distorted beyond recognition by the partial paschen - back effect .",
    "the magnetic field geometry in hd154708 has not previously been studied . in this work we present for the first time a mean longitudinal magnetic field measurement series , obtained with the multi - mode instrument fors1 installed at the 8-m kueyen telescope .",
    "the data are used to obtain the rotation period and to put constraints on the magnetic field geometry .",

    "magnetic field measurements of hd154708 with fors1 .",
    "all quoted errors are 1@xmath16 uncertainties . in the last three lines we list the earlier measurements published in @xcite . [ cols= \" < , > , < , > , < \" , ]",

    "july in service mode . using the narrowest available slit width of 04 the achieved spectral resolving power of the fors1 spectra obtained with",
    "the grism 600b was about 2000 .",
    "these observations made use of a new mosaic detector with blue optimized e2v chips , which was installed in fors1 at the beginning of april 2007 .",
    "it has a pixel size of 15@xmath17 m ( compared to 24@xmath17 m for the previous tektronix chip ) and higher efficiency in the wavelength range below 6000 . with the new mosaic detector and the grism 600b ,",
    "we are also able to cover a much larger spectral range , from 3250 to 6215 .",
    "a detailed description of the assessment of the longitudinal magnetic field measurements using fors1 is presented in our previous papers ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "we repeat here the major steps of the magnetic field determination . the mean longitudinal magnetic field , @xmath18 ,",
    "was derived using @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the stokes parameter which measures the circular polarization , @xmath21 is the intensity in the unpolarized spectrum , @xmath22 is the effective land factor , @xmath23 is the electron charge , @xmath13 is the wavelength , @xmath24 the electron mass , @xmath25 the speed of light , @xmath26 is the derivative of stokes @xmath21 , and @xmath27 is the mean longitudinal magnetic field . to minimize the cross - talk effect , we executed a sequence of spectropolarimetric observations at different position angles of the retarder waveplate , + 45@xmath845 , + 45@xmath845 , + 45@xmath845 , etc . , and calculated the values @xmath28 using :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 denotes the position angle of the retarder waveplate and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are ordinary and extraordinary beams , respectively .",
    "stokes @xmath21 values were obtained from the sum of the ordinary and extraordinary beams .",
    "to derive @xmath33 , a least - squares technique was used to minimize the expression @xmath34 where , for each spectral point @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is a constant term that , assuming that eq .",
    "[ eqn : one ] is correct , approximates the fraction of instrumental polarization not removed after the application of eq .",
    "[ eqn : two ] to the observations . in our calculations",
    "we assumed a land factor @xmath39 for hydrogen lines and @xmath40 for metal lines .",
    "the average land factor for metal lines is obtained using individual land factors for the observed spectral lines and is close to the value @xmath41 published by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in our reduction procedure the spectral regions containing telluric lines have been excluded in the measurements of the magnetic field .",
    "the errors of the measurements of the polarization have been determined from photon statistics and have been converted to errors of field measurements .",
    "longitudinal magnetic fields were measured in two ways : using only the absorption hydrogen balmer lines , or using the entire spectrum including all available absorption lines . due to the low resolution of the fors1 polarimetric spectra and due to the fact that the major contribution to the measured magnetic field strength comes from the hydrogen lines ,",
    "the weak - field approximation can be reasonably adopted for magnetic field strengths up to a few tens of kg .",
    "the results of our magnetic field measurements are presented in table  [ tab : hd154_magfield ] . in the first column we provide the modified julian dates at the middle of the exposures .",

    "all quoted errors are 1@xmath16 uncertainties . in the last three lines we list the earlier measurements published in @xcite .",
    "an initial frequency analysis was performed on the longitudinal magnetic field measurements given in col .  2 of table  [ tab : hd154_magfield ] using the discrete fourier transform programme of @xcite .",
    "the resulting amplitude spectrum clearly shows a dominant peak with an equivalent period near 5.3d , but the 13 measurements are not uniformly sampled over the rotation cycle for this period .",
    "we thus used the more appropriate frequency analysis technique of fitting a sinusoid by linear least - squares for a range of frequencies .",
    "[ fig : lsps1 ] shows the unambiguous result .",
    "the best - fitting frequency of 0.18627d@xmath43 was then fitted by both linear least - squares and nonlinear least - squares sinusoidal fitting routines .",
    "the latter allows an estimate of the frequency uncertainty , and the former gives estimates of the amplitude and phase error of the fit .",
    "the resulting best fit gives the rotational frequency @xmath44d@xmath45 , for a rotational period of @xmath46d .",
    "the derived ephemeris for this period is : @xmath47 to refine the period determination we combined the data in col .  3 of table  [ tab : hd154_magfield ] for the hydrogen lines with three previously published measurements made using the same technique obtained by @xcite .",
    "this data set has a time span of 3y , hence higher frequency resolution than the frequency analysis of the data obtained in a single season presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : lsps1 ] .",
    "however , with only a few data points from previous years , the alias problem must be examined carefully . because of the sparse distribution of the data , a frequency analysis was performed by fitting sinusoids by least - squares over an appropriate range of frequencies . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lsps2 ] , there is some alias ambiguity , but it is not severe and a best - fitting frequency can be selected . as long as this is the correct alias , the rotation period is therefore refined to @xmath48d for hd154708 . for this determination",
    "equal weights were used . to increase the accuracy of the rotation period even further , we used a non - linear least - squares fit of the function @xmath49 to the same 16  data points with weights equal to @xmath50 , with the @xmath51 uncertainties as listed in col .  3 of table  [ tab : hd154_magfield ] .",
    "we used the value @xmath52 found as the starting value for the fit and find @xmath53 d. we consider this rotation period as the most accurate .",
    "a similar fit was performed on the 13  data points obtained using the entire spectrum including all available absorption lines , but we kept in this case the period fixed .",
    "the resulting final values are @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 with a reduced @xmath57 .",

    "the present data represent the first set of mean longitudinal magnetic field measurements of a single star obtained with fors1 with a sufficiently uniform phase coverage to establish this important result .",
    "the measurement with the largest sigma ( @xmath63 g ) was obtained in weather conditions classified as `` thick clouds '' , where the guide star was frequently lost , and thus was repeated by the service observer a couple of nights later . without taking into account this measurement we obtain a reduced @xmath64 .",
    "a rather short rotation period of 5.3666days is obtained for hd154708 based on the new thirteen low resolution spectropolarimetric observations .",
    "this is fully consistent with the result found by @xcite that mean magnetic field moduli in excess of 7.5 kg are only found in stars with rotation periods shorter than 150 days .",
    "while many magnetic ap stars have very long rotation periods , up to several tens of years , or even close to 1 century in some cases , none of them have extremely strong fields such as hd154708 .",
    "@xcite found for hd154708 a very low value for @xmath65 .",
    "our recent fit to the observed spectral line profile of the magnetically insensitive line fe  i  @xmath66 resulted in @xmath67kms@xmath43 .",

    "we obtain @xmath75kms@xmath43 , leading to a value for the inclination angle in the range @xmath76 .",
    "our measurements exhibit a smooth , single - wave variation of the longitudinal magnetic field during the stellar rotation cycle .",
    "these observations can be considered as evidence for a dominant dipolar contribution to the magnetic field topology . based on the assumption that the magnetic ap stars are oblique dipole rotators , @xcite defined          from the values determined above ,",

    "the measured magnetic field modulus of @xmath8824.5 kg using magnetically resolved lines @xcite is of the same order as that estimated for the presented geometry of the magnetic field .",
    "the limb - darkening coefficient is a function of wavelength . since no realistic model atmosphere exists yet for the roap stars with extremely strong magnetic fields , the actual mean limb - darkening coefficient for the spectral range we observed for hd154708 is uncertain .",
    "we note that the choice of other mean limb - darkening coefficients would extend the range of possible @xmath1 values .",
    "the high spectral resolution uves spectra of hd154708 at three different dates at a resolving power of @xmath89 available in the eso archive show almost the same appearance of magnetically resolved zeeman components . in fig .",

    "the spectra obtained on may 20 , 2005 at phase 0.72 and on july 23 , 2006 at phase 0.76 are average spectra of the time series used to study rapid oscillations in this star .",
    "this does not represent a strong constraint : in more than half of the known ap stars with resolved magnetically split lines , the ratio between the extrema of the mean field modulus is lower than 1.1 , and in 75%  of them , it does not exceed 1.3 .",
    "the three measurements of @xmath90 that are currently available are insufficient to define its variation , or to check its consistency with the derived value of the rotation period .",
    "@xcite found a predominance of small values of @xmath78 for stars with @xmath91d .",
    "the only star with a comparable field strength in their sample is babcock s star hd215441 , which has @xmath35 and @xmath78 angles of the order of @xmath8830@xmath2 , i.e.  similar to the @xmath35 and @xmath78 determined for hd154708 .",
    "babcock s star is much hotter and more massive than hd154708 , and its rotation period is somewhat longer at ( @xmath92d ) than that of hd154708 .",
    "it is premature to make any statistical assertion about the efficiency of magnetic braking and field geometry evolution just from the knowledge of these two strongly magnetic stars . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite studied the behaviour of the angle @xmath78 in ap stars of different masses and ages .",
    "the obliquity angle distribution as inferred from the distribution of @xmath93-values appears random at the time magnetic stars become observable on the h - r diagram . after only a short time spent on the main sequence , the obliquity angle",
    "@xmath78 then tends to reach values close to either 90@xmath94 or 0@xmath94 for @xmath95@xmath96 .",
    "as we already mentioned above , due to the presence of the very strong magnetic field in the atmosphere of hd154708 , its spectrum is very complex and many spectral lines need a detailed paschen - back treatment . on the other hand , due to the low value of @xmath65 and the relatively short rotation period ,",
    "this star is one of the most suitable targets to study various atmospheric effects that interact with a strong magnetic field ."
