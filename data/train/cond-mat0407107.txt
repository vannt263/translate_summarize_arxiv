    "developing an ab initio understanding for soft - matter problems , such as found both in the biosciences and in carbon - based nanotechnology , represents an important challenge .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) provides , in principle , the necessary materials - theory account but traditional implementations of dft are insufficient for soft matter  @xcite .",
    "traditional dft implementations provide an accurate account of the intra - molecular ( intra - material ) binding in regions with a high electron density .",
    "however , the typical soft - matter problem , like the binding of graphitic and layered materials  @xcite , of polymer matrices  @xcite , and of polyaromatic dimers  @xcite , is defined by regions of sparse electron density . here",
    "traditional dft implementations provide no consistent account  @xcite because they lack a description of the van der waals ( vdw ) or dispersion forces .",
    "this shortfall of traditional dft has motivated a series of development works by us  @xcite and by others  @xcite that seeks a consistent extension of traditional dft ( accurate for intra - molecular binding ) with electron - density based calculations of the van der waals interactions ( for the intermolecular binding ) .",
    "we thereby extend traditional dft in a consistent approach that avoids double counting of the electron interaction effects .",
    "the exchange - correlation energy @xmath0 $ ] is a functional of the electron density @xmath1 and represents the central concept in all dft approximations .",
    "it represents the total electron - electron interaction energy which is not included in the mean - field approximation described by the electron poisson potential @xmath2 .",
    "together with the external potential @xmath3 , the functional @xmath0 $ ] completely determines the general dft calculational scheme for the total energy @xmath4 + \\int d\\mathbf{r } \\ , n(\\mathbf{r } ) \\ ,",

    "the term @xmath5 $ ] in ( [ eq : dftscheme ] ) is the kinetic energy of a non - interacting system at density @xmath1 and is in dft straight forward to calculate as a single - particle schrdinger equation problem specific to the materials system , as discussed , for example , in refs .",
    "the functional @xmath0 $ ] , however , is universal and it is this functional that we seek to improve beyond the traditional local - density and generalized gradient approximations in the investigations for a new van - der - waals - density functional ( vdw - df ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we illustrate the nature of such a new vdw - df by ab initio and analytical calculations of the intermediate - range interactions between parallel ( unbranched ) polymers and nanotubes .",
    "specifically , we investigate the interactions between polyethylene ( pe ) , isotactic polypropylene ( pp ) , isotactic polyvinylchloride ( pvc ) , and single - walled carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) .",
    "we first determine the structural geometry of the isolated molecules by self - consistent dft calculations using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , allowing the atoms to relax to the energetically optimal positions . in the optimization",
    "the atoms are moved according to the hellmann - feynman forces in the gga ; details of these calculations will be published separately @xcite . to this state - of - the - art description of the individual molecular structure",
    "we here add a charge - density based description of the intermolecular binding .",
    "the elongated molecules represent an important class of soft - matter interaction problems because they have very anisotropic dielectrical response functions , and as such constitute a special problem .",
    "this interaction is naturally separated in three regimes : ( i ) at binding distances where the van der waals attraction and kinetic repulsion compete , ( ii ) the intermediate regime where the local electron density variation is important but where the electron overlap can be neglected , and ( iii ) the asymptotic regime where the van der waals interaction is given by the overall ( as opposed to the locally varying ) susceptibility of the molecules and where traditional van der waals calculations @xcite become feasible .",
    "we focus on describing the transition of the molecular van der waals interactions from intermediate separations and out to asymptotic separations .    the emphasis on intermediate molecule separations @xmath6 permits us to use a simpler approximative treatment of the anisotropic dielectric response , which we determine upon averaging the electron density along the polymer and nanotube axis .",
    "our aim is to find general trends in polymer - polymer and nanotube - nanotube interactions , and rather than aiming at numerical , very accurate results we here develop analytical , approximate expressions for use in further analyzing the system .",
    "more accurate numerical studies , with improved calculations of the molecular dielectrical response , are deferred to a forthcoming paper .",
    "the vdw interactions involve fluctuating ( dipole and multipole ) interactions which are naturally expressed in terms of the bare ( local - field ) and external - field susceptibility tensors , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . starting from the adiabatic connection formula @xcite the dipole - dipole approximation of the exchange - correlation energy of two well separated objects 1 and 2 can be written as @xcite @xmath9= e_{\\mathrm{vdw}}[n]&\\simeq &   -\\int_0^{\\infty } \\frac{du}{2\\pi }   \\int d^3 r_1 \\int d^3 r'_1   \\int d^3 r_2\\int d^3 r'_2 \\nonumber\\\\[0.6em ] & & \\sum_{a , b , c , d } \\chi_{\\mathrm{eff},1}^{ab}(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}'_1;u )   t_{12}^{bc}(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2 ) \\chi_{\\mathrm{eff},2}^{cd}(\\mathbf{r}_2,\\mathbf{r}'_2;u )   t_{21}^{da}(\\mathbf{r}_2,\\mathbf{r}_1)\\ , .",

    "hartree atomic units are used throughout , unless otherwise noted .    in this study",
    "we seek only to explore the formal nature of the interactions between parallel polymers and nanotubes .",
    "we therefore make use of a simplified but electron - density based model description of the bare molecular susceptibility @xmath7 which is assumed diagonal .",
    "this model assumption implies that the anisotropic dielectric response @xmath8 ( that characterizes the external - field response of polymers / nanotubes ) is taken to arrive exclusively by the local - field effects that are specified by this diagonal @xmath7 .    for the diagonal elements of @xmath7 we use the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite , that is , a slightly modified version of the effective susceptibility used in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath13 the valence electron density @xmath14 is obtained directly from the above - mentioned self - consistent dft calculations .",
    "the cut - off frequency @xmath15 was introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : locsusc ] ) to avoid an unphysical divergence in the static limit ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the cut - off is determined from a separate set of self - consistent dft calculations that provide results for the static polarization by imposing a finite external electrical field @xcite perpendicular to the polymer and nanotube axis .",
    "figure  [ figdens ] shows the electron density ( averaged along the polymer and nanotube axis ) as calculated by traditional dft for the molecules pe , pvc , and cnt .",
    "the averaging along the length is done in the same spirit as our calculations for the vdw interactions in layered materials  @xcite .",
    "the averaging provides a qualitative picture of the electron - density variation that effectively determines the intermolecular vdw interaction at the relevant intermediate molecular separations . for simplicity",
    "we choose to base the set of numerical and analytical evaluations of the vdw correction ( [ eq : evdw ] ) on dielectric - response functions specified by these averaged electron densities .",
    "figure  [ figdens ] also suggests that this effective electron distribution has an approximate cylindrical rotational symmetry which we utilize for further simplifications in our present model study .",
    "we term such molecules ` cylindrical ' and these remain the focus of this paper because they offer in several cases comparison against analytical expansions and evaluations . we stress that for the question of the mutual vdw interactions the most relevant measure of cylindrical symmetry is exactly the angle - dependence of the static external field response . in the set of investigated molecules",
    "this angle - dependence is small , as shown for pe in the inset of figure [ figenergy](a ) from direct evaluation in traditional dft .",
    "an element of charge at position @xmath17 ( specified in two dimensions relative to the molecule center - of - mass line ) on the molecule responds to the local electric field according to @xmath18 given by ( [ eq : locsusc ] ) .",
    "the local field is the applied electric field @xmath19 ( which arises from charge fluctuations at the other molecule ) screened by the presence of other elements of charge in the neighborhood .",
    "the local electric field is described via the local electric potential @xmath20 and given by charge conservation @xmath21 the effective susceptibility tensor @xmath22 , which appears in the expression for the interaction energy ( [ eq : evdw ] ) , is related to the local susceptibility and the local electric potential by @xmath23 due to the assumed translational invariance along the length of the molecule we can in general solve ( [ eq : chargecon ] ) numerically as a two - dimensional differential equation in @xmath20 with the frequency @xmath24 as a parameter , and thus find @xmath25 from ( [ eq : chieff ] ) .",
    "the spatial integral @xmath26 taken at @xmath16 gives us the molecular , macroscopic susceptibility tensor as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "comparing @xmath27 to the static dft - calculated molecular susceptibility we determine the frequency constant @xmath15 .    in polymers",
    "our approach @xcite yields a value of the static polarization which varies with the angle at which the electric field is applied .",
    "however , for the simple polymers the variation is small , as shown for pe in the inset of figure  [ figenergy](a ) . for pp and pvc",
    "the susceptibility is almost constant with respect to rotation , with @xmath28 e@xmath29/v and @xmath30 e@xmath29/v .",

    "@xmath15 depends on the nanotube radius . however , the variation is small and the macroscopic susceptibility is not very sensitive to this variation . for cnt",
    "we thus use the large - nanotube value @xcite for all nanotubes , @xmath34 ha .    in the expression for the van der waals energy ( [ eq : evdw ] )",
    "the two spatial integrals along the ( density averaged ) molecules can be performed analytically @xcite , but leave a cumbersome integral over the remaining spatial variables and the frequency .",
    "these integrals can be numerically solved , and the results for pairs of parallel polymers are shown in figure  [ figenergy](a ) for a specific relative orientation of the polymers . the results for other relative orientations will be reported in ref .",
    "whereas it is possible to numerically evaluate @xmath35 for a general pair of parallel molecules , such results provide only limited insight into the vdw interaction mechanism . to interpret such numerical evaluations we provide instead analytical results that are possible to derive with our choice of simplified local susceptibility function ( [ eq : locsusc ] ) for cylindrical molecules",
    "when cylindrical symmetry is imposed , the local electric potential @xmath36 factorizes into @xmath37 , where @xmath38 measures the angle from the direction of the applied field . solving ( [ eq : chargecon ] )",
    "then reduces to the one - dimensional problem of finding @xmath39 with @xmath24 as a parameter . in ref .",
    "@xcite the more complex problem of non - cylindrical polymers will be treated in greater detail .    for cylindrical molecules @xmath22 is diagonal in the cylindrical representation @xmath40 @xcite , and the interaction energy reduces to @xmath41 where the geometry factors are @xmath42 ^ 2\\,\\ , .",

    "our further treatment of the interaction energy expression differs depending on the nature of the molecules considered . on the one hand",
    "the polymers considered here are thin ( radius @xmath47   ) compared to the typical nanotube ( radius @xmath48   ) and compared to the typical binding separation ( @xmath494  plus radii of molecules ) .",
    "this means that a large - separation approximation , based on the center - of - mass to center - of - mass distance @xmath6 , is a better approximation for the polymers than for nanotubes . on the other hand ,",
    "nanotubes are about the most cylindrically symmetric extended molecules that exist , and the major part of the electron density is concentrated in a thin cylindrical shell , as shown in figure  [ figdens ] .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to approximate the nanotube electron charge density by a weighted radial delta - function .",
    "we further approximate the nanotube effective susceptibility tensor by assuming @xmath50 .",
    "below , we pursue these approximations for polymers and for nanotubes .",
    "we also show that the two sets of derivations are consistent under relevant conditions .",
    "as argued above , we can explore the polymer interactions in an expansion in powers of @xmath51 .",

    "[ figenergy](b ) the @xmath51-expansion is illustrated along with a numerical calculation that keeps the full angular dependence not assuming any rotational invariance ( solid line ) .",

    "the thin dotted line is the lowest order contribution ( [ nj ] ) of the expansion .",
    "as the next non - vanishing order , @xmath62 , is added the description is improved ( thin dashed line ) .",
    "we checked that adding the 9th order did improve the description of the energy slightly , but not significantly at the separations considered here . as a comparison",
