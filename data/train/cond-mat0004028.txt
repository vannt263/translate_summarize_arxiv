    "the equilibrium properties of spin glass have remained a great challenge in numerical simulations .",
    "investigating the equilibrium ground - state structure of spin glass is also important and interesting . in the last 20 years",
    ", there has been a great deal of work on spin glass  @xcite .",
    "it is generally agreed that the simplest spin glass system for most theoretical work is the edwards - anderson ( ea ) model , whose hamiltonian is @xmath3 where @xmath4 takes on the values @xmath5 and the sum goes over the nearest neighbors .",
    "the @xmath6 are dimensionless variables which describe the random interactions between the spins and are taken as @xmath7 . in two dimensions , a phase transition occurs only at zero temperature  @xcite for this kind of @xmath0 ising spin glass with nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "this model has been studied previously by the transfer matrix method  @xcite , replica monte carlo method  @xcite , multicanonical ensemble method  @xcite and many other methods ( see ref  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the traditional monte carlo methods mostly concentrate on generating standard statistical ensembles , e.g. , the canonical ensemble or microcanonical ensemble . using the canonical ensemble simulations , we need to simulate at different temperatures to get full information about the system .",
    "it is tedious to calculate certain thermodynamic quantities like the free energy and the entropy since the density of states can not be obtained directly from the simulation data .",
    "the correlation between subsequent configurations generated by canonical ensemble simulations also causes the ergodicity problem for some systems . in 1991 , berg proposed the multicanonical ensemble method  @xcite to overcome the above shortcomings of simulations on canonical ensemble .",
    "the multicanonical ensemble is an ensemble where the probability @xmath8 of having energy @xmath9 at equilibrium is a constant .",
    "the multicanonical method has been very successful in solving the systems that involve energy barriers .",
    "recently , wang proposed a dynamics  @xcite which can generate a flat histogram in the energy space as the multicanonical method .",
    "this dynamics has some connections with the broad histogram method  @xcite , which does not give the correct microcanonical average  @xcite .",
    "similar to the broad histogram method , the new dynamics is also based on @xmath10 , the ( microcanonical ) average number of potential moves which increase the energy by @xmath11 in a single spin flip . a cumulative average ( over monte carlo steps )",
    "can be used as a first approximation to the exact microcanonical average in the flip rate .",
    "thermodynamic quantities can be then calculated from the simulation data with ease . in this paper",
    ", we use the new method to study the thermodynamics as well as ground - state properties for the two - dimensional ising spin glass system .    in section 2 ,",
    "the flat histogram transition matrix monte carlo dynamics is described . using the flat histogram sampling",
    ", we get the average number of potential moves @xmath12 , which can be used to construct a transition matrix monte carlo dynamics in the energy space  @xcite .",
    "we apply the new method to two - dimensional ising spin glass and present some numerical results in section 3 . in the last section , we give a conclusion to the new method .",
    "to connect our dynamics with single - spin - flip glauber dynamics  @xcite , we restrict the protocol of each move to be single - spin flip in the following discussion . for a given state @xmath13 with energy @xmath9 , consider all possible single - spin flips .",
    "the single - spin flips change the current state into @xmath14 possible new states , with new energy @xmath15 . for two - dimensional ising spin glass ,",
    "@xmath11 = @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "we classify the @xmath14 new states according to @xmath11 and count the number of @xmath19 .",
    "since each move from the state @xmath13 of energy @xmath9 to the state @xmath20 of energy @xmath21 and the reverse move are both allowed , the total number of moves from all the states with energy @xmath9 to @xmath21 is the same as from @xmath21 to @xmath9 .",
    "thus , we have  @xcite @xmath22 the microcanonical average of a quantity @xmath23 is defined as @xmath24 where the summation is over all the configurations having energy @xmath9 and @xmath25 is the density of states . in terms of the microcanonical averages ,",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ balance ] ) as @xmath26 eq .",
    "( [ detail ] ) is the basic result of the broad histogram method  @xcite . while the broad histogram random walk algorithm is not correct , eq .",
    "( [ detail ] ) is not problematic and taken as the starting point of the flat histogram sampling .",
    "we select a site to flip at random",
    ". the flip rate for a single - spin flip from state @xmath13 with energy @xmath9 to @xmath20 with energy @xmath15 is chosen as @xmath27 then the detailed balance condition for this rate @xmath28 is satisfied for @xmath29 .",
    "thus the energy histogram is flat  @xcite , @xmath30    since @xmath31 is not known in general , an approximation scheme should be used to start the simulation . for those @xmath9 which we have not visited yet , we simply set @xmath32 .",
    "then a cumulative average ( over monte carlo steps ) can be used as an approximation to the exact microcanonical average in the flip rate .",
    "we have numerical evidence that this procedure converges to the exact result .",
    "we can then construct a transition matrix monte carlo dynamics in the energy space  @xcite with @xmath31 . for a single - spin - flip glauber dynamics with energy change @xmath11 ,",
    "the flip rate is given as @xmath33 .\\ ] ] since there are ( on average ) @xmath31 different ways of going from @xmath9 to @xmath15 , the total probability for transition from @xmath9 to @xmath21 is @xmath34 the diagonal elements can be determined by @xmath35 , since the total probability from @xmath9 to @xmath21 is 1 .",
    "this new dynamics in the space of energy @xmath9 is related to single - spin - flip dynamics by  @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the transition matrix of the single - spin - flip dynamics .",
    "the equilibrium state of the transition matrix gives the canonical probability distribution of energy @xmath38 .",
    "an important aspect of this dynamics is that we can calculate the thermodynamic quantities easily by just performing one simulation for each coupling state @xmath6 .",
    "the density of states @xmath25 can be obtained through eq .",
    "( [ detail ] ) .",
    "once we have the density of states @xmath25 , we can obtain @xmath39 and then calculate any thermodynamic quantities of interest . in actual implementation ,",
    "we usually determine @xmath39 directly from the detailed balance equation @xmath40 instead of solving eq .",
    "( [ detail ] ) . from eq .",
    "( [ weight ] ) , we know , the transition matrix @xmath41 can be formed at any temperature once the quantity @xmath31 is computed accurately . in other words , the monte carlo computation is uncorrelated to thermodynamics .",
    "the temperature dependence enters only after simulation in the weighting formula .    like berg s multicanonical ensemble simulations",
    ", our dynamics also generate a multicanonical ensemble in the energy space . from this point ,",
    "both of the two dynamics have the same goal of flattening the space of energy .",
    "but they are quite different in implementation . in the multicanonical ensemble method",
    ", the flip rate is chosen as the inverse of the density of states @xmath25 , parametrized in some way . to start the simulation , we need give an estimate of @xmath25 , since @xmath25 is not initially known . thus , the efficiency of this method is determined by the goodness of the estimated @xmath25 . if @xmath25 is not given properly , say far off the true density , the simulations may get stuck in some region . with our method",
    ", we sample the energy space with a flip rate which is related to the density of states through eq .",
    "( [ detail ] ) .",
    "the central quantity is @xmath12 which can be quite accurate in a short simulation time . and the accuracy of this quantity is improved by further simulations .",
    "we then provide an alternate for the estimate of @xmath25 , which leads to a more efficient way for simulating the multicanonical ensemble .",
    "+ the flat histogram also generalizes easily to multi - variate models @xcite .",
    "an example is the ising spin glass model with overlap parameter @xmath42 which has the hamiltonian @xmath43 @xmath9 refers to the first two interaction terms involving the coupling constants @xmath6 . in this bivariate case ,",
    "the quantity @xmath44 generalize to @xmath45 .",
    "it can be easily shown that the detailed balance condition is now @xmath46 with @xmath47 as the new  density of states \" .",
    "the algorithm gives a flat histogram in both @xmath9 and @xmath42 .",
    "we have performed simulations on lattices of size @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "each simulation starts with independent random numbers . to illustrate the performance of our algorithm",
    ", we define the time @xmath50 as the average number ( over coupling constant @xmath6 ) of monte carlo steps needed to reach the ground - states .",
    "a monte carlo step is defined as flipping each spin on the lattice once ( on the average ) .",
    "table 1 gives an overview of typical time in monte carlo steps to reach the ground - states , starting from an arbitrary energy level .",
    "the time to reach the ground - states depends on the size of the system and also the random interactions .",
    "we consider a large number of random coupling states to make the statistical error small enough in table  1 .",
    "the simulations are long enough to ensure that the ground states are really reached .",
    "in fig.1 we plot the time @xmath50 versus lattice size @xmath51 on a double log scale .",
    "the data are consistent with a straight - line fit , which gives the finite - size behavior @xmath52 the corresponding cpu time for a digital alpha 600 m workstation is also shown in table  1 . for accuracy ,",
    "5 independent runs are performed for each lattice size to obtain the average cpu time . up to @xmath53 the cpu time",
    "can be approximated by a polynomial function of @xmath54 .",
    "+    .average mc steps and cpu time to find the ground - states for different lattice size . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we also compared with hatano s result @xcite that autocorrelation time scales approximately as volume @xmath14 of the system .",
    "we look at the tunneling time which is a better measure of the algorithm s efficiency in our case . from our results given in table 2",
    ", we found no support for hatano s result .",
    "instead , the power law fit ( see fig .  2 ) @xmath55 is almost the same as the monovariate case .",
    "this is not surprising as berg mentioned that the optimal performance for multicanonical algorithm is @xmath56(=@xmath57 ) based on random walk picture .",
    "the ground - state energy and entropy of the infinite system are also estimated using our method .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the ground - state energy in the simulation stage .",
    "we calculate the ground - state entropy from @xmath58 since @xmath25 can be calculated from the simulation data directly , we then obtain @xmath59 with ease .",
    "to compare with the results obtained in the literature , we fit our data using the form @xmath60 and get @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "the energy fit is plotted in fig .  3 , and the entropy fit in fig .  4 .",
    "our energy estimate @xmath1 is consistent with the previous mc estimate  @xcite @xmath61 as well as with the transfer matrix result  @xcite @xmath62 .",
    "our entropy estimate @xmath2 is also consistent with the mc estimate  @xcite @xmath63 as well as the transfer matrix result  @xcite @xmath64 .",
    "for the two - dimensional ising spin glass system , de simone et al .",
    "@xcite use an exact algorithm based on the branch - and - cut technique to find the exact ground - states with system size up to @xmath65 .",
    "they obtain the extrapolated result @xmath66 .",
    "when compared with berg s result , @xmath67 , it seems that our method gives a more accurate estimate for ground - state energy and entropy for an infinite system .",
    "we have used a new approach to investigate the ground - state properties of the two - dimensional ising spin glass . compared with standard simulations ,",
    "the advantage of our method is obvious . for the ergodicity problem encountered in standard simulations",
    ", our method behaves as well as berg s multicanonical ensemble method , while it is easier to be implemented compared with berg s method .",
    "our method also generalize straightforwardly to multi - variate models without much effort in programming and theory .    to find a true ground - state , we roughly need a cpu time of order @xmath68 .",
    "it is the same with lawler s exact algorithm  @xcite .",
    "up to size @xmath69 , de simone s algorithm also needs a time of order @xmath68 .",
    "but it is not clear whether his algorithm can be efficiently implemented for 3d systems .",
    "however our method can also be easily applied to 3d spin glass system .",
    "if one is just interested in finding the ground - states , there are also other optimized algorithms .",
    "chen s learning algorithm  @xcite is fast in finding the ground - states compared with most algorithms , but it is not a general one .",
    "thermodynamic quantities can not be obtained with this algorithm .",
