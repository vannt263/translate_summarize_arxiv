    "<S> if we add a sufficiently large @xmath2 isospin multiplet , the new field provides a good dark matter candidate because direct interactions with sm particles are forbidden automatically by renomalizability  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> it is also known that additional scalar boson loops can increase the triple ( sm - like ) higgs boson coupling@xcite , which help to satisfy the sphaleron decoupling condition for the electroweak baryogenesis@xcite . a special choice of the higgs multiplet </S>",

    "<S> the scale is called landau pole ( lp ) , where the coupling constant becomes infinite @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of the lp at a certain scale , e.g. , plank scale , is often required to constrain the higgs quartic coupling ( equivalently the higgs boson mass in the sm)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this bound can be understood as a criteria for perturbativity of the theory .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we give the rge analysis of the scalar quartic coupling constants in the sm with one more scalar multiplet @xmath0 , where the field @xmath0 is a @xmath1 representation under @xmath2 with a hypercharge @xmath3 . </S>",

    "<S> the lp we will derive from the scalar quartic coupling constants is much lower than that obtained by solving one - loop beta functions of the gauge coupling constants  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the point is that the quartic coupling constants of @xmath0 are rapidly induced by the electroweak gauge couplings with large coefficients ( due to the large electroweak charges ) in the beta functions , even if the initial values of the quartic coupling constants are set to be zeros . </S>",
    "<S> once a finite quartic coupling is injected , the rge running of the quartic coupling constant leads the lp . in general </S>",
    "<S> , there are many degrees of freedom to choose the initial condition for the new coupling constants . among them </S>",

    "<S> .the independent coupling constants in the scalar potential are listed . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the dimension four extra couplings which contribute to the beta functions . [ </S>",
    "<S> cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to understand the results analytically , we focus on the beta function of the quartic coupling of @xmath0 in which the gauge coupling @xmath26 is approximated by the constant @xmath27 . then , we redefine the quartic coupling constants @xmath28 such that @xmath29 terms only appear in one beta function . by this redefinition </S>",
    "<S> , we correctly take into account the induced quartic coupling constant from the gauge couplings at one - loop level , since we begin with a conservative assumption given in eqs .  . </S>",
    "<S> we call the new coupling constants @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the rge is simplified as @xmath31 however , even if we set @xmath32 at @xmath33 , nonzero @xmath34 is induced by the @xmath35 term , which affects the running of @xmath36 through the @xmath37 term . </S>",

    "<S> , we have @xmath41 here we put @xmath42 and @xmath43 . at first </S>",
    "<S> , we redefine @xmath44 in order to cancel the constant term ( @xmath45 term ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we take @xmath46 where @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the requirement of the vanishing @xmath48 term fixes @xmath34 up to the normalization , while we still have the degree of freedom to redefine @xmath36 . using this </S>",
    "<S> , we define @xmath49 as @xmath50 and choose @xmath51 in such a way that the @xmath52 term vanishes in the beta function of @xmath49 . </S>",

    "<S> the above expressions fit the numerical results within an order of magnitude error . from this analytical analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we confirm that the finite quartic coupling constants are originally generated by the gauge couplings , and then the rge of the quartic coupling constant leads the lp . roughly speaking , </S>",
    "<S> the lp is induced by two - loop radiative corrections to the rges . </S>",
    "<S> we can also evaluate the exponent of @xmath33 by putting @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> although the analytic expression is too complicate to write , we obtain @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .   + before concluding this letter , </S>",
    "<S> a few more remarks are given in order . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the position of the lp does not depend on the normalization of @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> we can understand the reason from eqs .   and </S>",
    "<S> as follows ; let us define the new scalar coupling constant having a different normalization as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a real constant . </S>",
    "<S> although the rge of @xmath63 takes the same form as @xmath64 , the coefficients are different . </S>",
    "<S> they are @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . by using these coefficients and @xmath68 </S>",
    "<S> , one can easily show that the lp for @xmath63 calculated by eq .   </S>",
    "<S> gives the same result as that of @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we do not need to care about the normalizations of scalar couplings when we study the lp .    </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we discuss the nonzero value of the initial condition . </S>",
    "<S> let us start with eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> expanding eq .   around @xmath69 </S>",
    "<S> , we get @xmath70,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which means that the scale of the lp is determined by only the initial value and @xmath71 . the conditions to neglect higher order terms are @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , @xmath73 for @xmath74 .    </S>",
    "<S> though we have focused on a single scalar extension of the sm in this letter , more matter fields may be added . </S>",
    "<S> since the increase of scalar fields leads to the large coefficient in the beta functions in general , we expect that the scale of the lp becomes lower . </S>",
    "<S> if we add fermions in addition to scalars , the yukawa couplings among them may be allowed . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , the scale of the lp can be large since the yukawa coupling gives the negative contribution to the beta function at the one - loop level . finally , we comment on the implications of the new physics beyond the sm . in the minimal dark matter models  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , interactions of new scalar multiplets are also bounded by the relic abundance of dark matter and the data for direct / indirect searches . </S>",
    "<S> it is very interesting to combine our study with such constraints@xcite . in some class of the seesaw models for the neutrino mass generation </S>",
    "<S> , majorana fermions are introduced together with scalar multiplets , which may or may not accommodate a dark matter candidate . </S>",
    "<S> these models are constrained not only by the relic abundance but also by the neutrino oscillation data . in these models , </S>",
    "<S> the effects of majorana fermions on the rges are expected to be small , because the required yukawa coupling is generally small if we add these new fermions in the electroweak / tev scale . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , models with a flavor symmetry are also very intriguing candidates for this kind of analyses . because the scalar fields are embedded in the multiplet under the flavor symmetry , which provides a large number of @xmath2 multiplets . </S>",
    "<S> increase of the number of multiplet also gives large contribution to the rge , which would make the lp smaller@xcite .   </S>",
    "<S> + in conclusion , we have investigated the scale of the lp using the one - loop rge in the sm with one more scalar @xmath1-plet @xmath0 ( @xmath75 with all possible hypercharge assignments ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lp is found below planck scale for @xmath76 , if we introduce a new scalar multiplet at electroweak / tev scale . </S>",
    "<S> this means that any single scalar field extension with @xmath76 of the sm is not allowed , if we impose the absence of the lp up to planck scale . </S>",
    "<S> the scale is evaluated with the conservative initial condition , where the initial values for the quartic coupling constant of new scalar fields are set to be zeros at the scale of new particles . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the quartic coupling constants are induced from the electroweak gauge interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the induced coupling constants are rapidly enhanced , and finally hit the lp . </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the lp as a function of the mass of @xmath0 , and listed a fitting formula of the lp with an exponent . </S>",
    "<S> the results are consistent with our approximated formula within an order of magnitude error , which is derived from the simplified rge with the conservative assumption . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained lp in each model is much smaller than that previously calculated by solving the beta functions of the gauge couplings@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these new results are very useful and generic constraints on the beyond the sm including new scalar multiplets . </S>"
