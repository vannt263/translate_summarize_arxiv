    "monte carlo generators are an essential tool in modern day experimental high energy physics .",
    "they play a crucial rle in the analysis of the data , often in assessing the systematic errors of a measurement .",
    "for that reason it is of great importance that the monte carlo programs give results that agree closely with the experimental data .",
    "this paper aims to describe the agreement , deficiencies and tuning of the monte carlo models with the neutral current deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) data at hera .",
    "extensive use is made of the utility package hztool  @xcite , which is a fortran library containing a collection of experimental results from the h1 and zeus collaborations .",
    "the work described here is part of an ongoing program . during the workshop",
    "a forum was established between the h1 and zeus collaborations for a joint coordinated investigation of the generators working closely with the programs authors .",
    "the ariadne  @xcite , herwig  @xcite and lepto  @xcite monte carlo generators for dis data have been investigated during the course of the workshop .",
    "other programs such as rapgap  @xcite and those developed over the duration of the workshop will be examined as part of the ongoing program of work . in the following sections a brief introduction to each of the three generators studied",
    "is given .",
    "in ariadne the qcd cascade is modelled by emitting gluons from a chain of independently radiating dipoles spanning colour connected partons  @xcite , correcting the first emission to reproduce the first order matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "the hadronisation of the partons into final state particles is performed by the lund string model  @xcite as incorporated in jetset  @xcite .",
    "since the proton remnant at one endpoint of the parton chain is treated as an extended object , the coherence condition allows only a fraction of this source to be involved in gluon radiation . since the photon probing the proton only resolves the struck quark to a distance @xmath0 the struck quark is also treated as an extended object . as a consequence gluon emissions in the proton and photon directions are suppressed .",
    "this phase space restriction is governed by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the transverse momentum of the emission , @xmath3 is the fraction of the colour antenna involved in the radiation , @xmath4 is a parameter related to a typical inverse size of a hadron and @xmath5 governs the distribution of the energy along the dipole .    in the default version of ariadne , the mechanism for soft suppression of radiation due to the extended source of the proton remnant results in a suppression of radiation in the current region of the breit frame at high @xmath6 in the course of the workshop",
    "a high @xmath7 modification was developed  @xcite where this suppression in the current region was removed .",
    "herwig relies on a coherent parton branching algorithm with additional first order matrix element corrections @xcite to populate the extremities of phase space which the partons from the conventional qcd cascade fail to occupy .",
    "the partons are transformed into hadrons using the cluster fragmentation model @xcite , whereby the primary hadrons are produced from an isotropic two body decay of colour - singlet clusters formed from partonic constituents .",
    "since the monte carlo tuning to hera data at the ` future physics at hera workshop '  @xcite , a new version of herwig ( version 5.9 ) has become available .",
    "this version includes the modified remnant treatment of version 5.8d whereby the fragmentation of the cluster containing the hadronic remnant is treated differently to that containing the perturbative parton from the incident hadron .",
    "in addition , the particle decay tables have been updated and now contain a large amount of information on additional resonance decays .",
    "the default version of herwig  implements the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) running of the qcd coupling constant @xmath8 .",
    "the herwig  philosophy is to incorporate as much perturbative qcd behaviour as possible , so even though the generator only uses a leading order ( lo ) parton shower cascade , a nlo @xmath8 behaviour is implemented .",
    "this can be justified , to some degree , because of the herwig implementation of angular ordering in the qcd cascades .",
    "the h1 collaboration have modified herwig  to allow a lo behaviour of @xmath8 @xcite .      in lepto the hard parton processes",
    "are described by a leading order matrix element ( me ) .",
    "the soft and collinear divergences are regulated with a lower and upper cut in @xmath9 where @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( q ) is the proton ( photon ) four - vector and @xmath12 the four - vector of one of the partons produced in the hard subprocess .",
    "in addition , the invariant mass squared of the two hard partons is required to exceed a minimal value , @xmath13 . below the me",
    "cut - offs , parton emissions are treated by parton showers based on the dglap evolution equations @xcite .",
    "the amount of parton radiation depends on the virtuality chosen between a lower cut - off ( @xmath14 ) and a maximum given by the scale of the hard process or the me cut - off .",
    "lepto uses jetset for the hadronization of the partons .",
    "in addition to this non - perturbative phase , lepto introduces another non - perturbative mechanism .",
    "this is a soft ( i.e.  at a scale below @xmath14 ) colour interaction which assumes that the colour configuration of the partonic system can be changed whilst traversing the colour field of the proton remnant .",
    "this was introduced in order to reproduce the rapidity gap events observed at hera .    during the course of the workshop a new version of lepto",
    "was released ( version 6.5.2@xmath15 ) .",
    "this version introduced a new scheme for dealing with sci events , in which the probability of soft colour interactions is suppressed depending on the difference in area spanned by the possible string configurations ( after or before a soft colour interaction )  @xcite .",
    "this means at high @xmath7 there are effectively no soft colour interactions .",
    "these studies closely followed those of the previous tuning exercise @xcite performed at the ` future physics at hera ' workshop .",
    "however , they have been extended : jet data were now available for inclusion in the comparisons ; and , the behaviour of the parameter para(25 ) was considered for the first time .",
    "ariadne version 4.10 has been investigated including the modified treatment of high @xmath7 dis events ( mhar(151 ) = 2 . )",
    "._values of the ariadne parameters before and after tuning . _",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]",
    "during the course of the workshop new versions of the lepto and ariadne monte carlo generators were made available .",
    "these modified versions of the generators were in far better agreement with data .",
    "an attempt was made to find sets of parameters for the ariadne , lepto and herwig generators that would describe the dis hera data .",
    "it proved difficult to find such a parameter set that would describe the whole range of distributions at both low and high @xmath6 a number of parameter sets are given for each generator that are optimised for a particular region of phase space .",
    "this paper attempts to summarise a ` snapshot ' of an ongoing program of work between experimentalists of both the h1 and the zeus collaborations and the authors of the event generators .",
    "the ultimate aim is to have event generators that are able to describe the complex structure of dis events at hera as impressively as they do the lep data .",
