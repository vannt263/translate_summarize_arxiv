    "the work presented in this paper was initially stimulated by a question if the partition @xmath8 is stable , i.e. if @xmath4 is an idempotent map , that was posed by basili and iarrobino in their conference notes @xcite .",

    "it was pointed out to us by a referee that the latter follows from the fact that the set @xmath29 of all nilpotent elements of an algebraic lie algebra @xmath30 is irreducible , which in turn can be deduced from the existence of the levi decomposition and the irreducibility of @xmath31 in the reductive case , which was proved already by kostant @xcite .",
