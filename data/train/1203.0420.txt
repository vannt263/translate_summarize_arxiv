    "the desire of higher - density magnetic data storage is becoming more emergent to conform to the explosive growth of today s information industry .",
    "the continued downscaling of storage bits will require significant enhancement of magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae ) per atom to overcome the fundamental , superparamagnetic limit .",
    "single - atom magnetic anisotropy on surfaces serves as an important bottom - up approach of such enhancements .",
    "a surface magnetic adatom no longer has the isotropic orbital electronic structures of its free atom , and consequently its spin - orbit couplings ( soc ) vary in different spin orientations .",
    "such an anisotropy is not only technologically relevant to the smallest magnetic storage bit that can be built , but also of great scientific interest for its fascinating quantum effects @xcite .",
    "pioneering experiments @xcite have been able to measure the mae of single transition - metal atoms and dimers on surfaces , followed by computational studies @xcite that are consistent with the measurements . among those experiments ,",
    "scanning tunneling microscopes ( stm ) can even reach the precision such that magnetic atoms can be built , manipulated , and measured one atom at a time at desired atomic sites of a cun surface @xcite .",
    "there is even a very recent stm study @xcite that can fabricate a bistable atomic - scale antiferromagnet , which enables a low - temperature demonstration of dense nonvolatile storage of information .",
    "however , the magnetic properties of such adatoms , e.g.  spin density , have not yet been understood in simple , atomic - scale microscopic pictures .",
    "also , mae of non - transition - metal atoms , the rare earth for example , have not been explored , and are potential candidates with even higher single - atom mae so that one may build atomic - scale storage bits in the future .",
    "we start this study from first - principles calculations of a single rare - earth atom dysprosium ( dy ) on a cun surface .",
    "analysis of subshell quantum numbers , orbital shapes , and occupations of the @xmath2 orbitals leads to simple explanation of the calculated spin - density distribution of the dy atom .",
    "the success of such orbital analysis is then duplicated to the previously studied single fe atom on the same surface @xcite , showing that this simple picture works independently for both the transition - metal @xmath1 and rare - earth @xmath0 orbitals .",
    "this work of dy on a cun surface is also the first study of the mae of a single rare - earth atom on a surface , which is calculated by first principles to be a factor of five larger than the previously largest single - atom mae , co on the pt surface @xcite .",
    "we construct a supercell of 5-layer cu(100 ) slabs , place n and dy atoms on the surface in the same way as the density - functional - theory ( dft ) studies of single fe and mn adatoms @xcite , and then perform dft calculations using the basis set of all - electron full - potential linearized augmented plane wave @xcite . a naive local - density or generalized - gradient approximation makes the @xmath2 orbitals be pinned at the fermi level and causes a fractional @xmath2 occupation , inconsistent with the photoemission measurements of rare - earth nitride bulks , and this problem was shown to be resolved by performing a dft+u calculations instead @xcite .",
    "to find the correct @xmath3 and @xmath4 values for dft+u , we perform pbe+u calculations @xcite and inspect the @xmath2 occupation number @xmath5 of dy on the cun surface with a series of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath6 , and @xmath3 ranges from @xmath7 to @xmath8 ev ( noting that @xmath9 denotes pbe itself ) , the occupation number stays at @xmath10 regardless of the @xmath3 value used .",
    "this means that with solely @xmath3 turned on , the unphysical fermi - level pinning of one of the @xmath0 states remains the same as the naive pbe .",
    "if @xmath4 is turned on to be a positive value @xmath11 ev at @xmath12 ev , the @xmath0 state originally pinned at fermi - level lowers in energy , and becomes fully occupied .",
    "however , the occupation number then becomes @xmath13 , inconsistent with the typical @xmath14 in either a dft+u calculation of a dyn bulk @xcite or a recent quantum - chemistry , complete active space self - consistent field ( casscf ) calculation of a @xmath15 molecule @xcite .",
    "if we first determine @xmath16 ev from a constraint pbe calculation @xcite , and are gradually turning on a negative @xmath4 , we initially find that the dft self - consistent cycles do not converge before @xmath4 reaches @xmath17 ev , indicating unstable electronic structures .",
    "when @xmath4 reaches @xmath17 ev ,     within a @xmath18@xmath19 cube centered at the dy nucleus , by looking ( left to right ) along @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 directions .",
    "each stick - ball structure corresponds to one of the three directions .",
    "the purple surfaces are the corresponding fe spin density for comparison.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   within a @xmath18@xmath19 cube centered at the dy nucleus , by looking ( left to right ) along @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 directions",
    ". each stick - ball structure corresponds to one of the three directions .",
    "the purple surfaces are the corresponding fe spin density for comparison.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    the self - consistent cycles converge nicely , and give a reasonable occupation number @xmath23 , consistent with the typical @xmath24 configuration of dy .",
    "therefore , for dy on the cun surface , we have determined that @xmath16 ev and @xmath25 ev yields a @xmath26 configuration that agrees with both the dft+u calculation of a dyn bulk @xcite and the casscf calculation of a @xmath15 molecule @xcite .",
    "atomic charges and spins are calculated by bader analysis @xcite .",
    "as already pointed out in the previous fe study @xcite , when an adatom is deposited onto the cu site of the surface , it establishes polar covalent bonds with the nearest - neighbored n atoms that replaces the original cun binding network .",
    "the calculated electron density of a dy atom in the cun surface is shown in fig .",
    "[ contour]a , together with the previously calculated fe re - presented .",
    "as one can see , the dy atom , sitting even higher on top of the surface , attracts its neighboring n atoms further out of the surface than the fe case .",
    "we have also calculated that dy and its neighboring n are @xmath27 and @xmath28 charged respectively . compared with the @xmath29 and @xmath30 charged fe and its neighboring n respectively , the dy - n bond of the dy system has a polarity approximately the same as the fe - n .    by pointing the dy spin in the hollow , n - row , and out - of - plane three symmetry directions ( to be called @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 respectively ) in our pbe+u total - energy calculations with soc included , we obtain the dy mae @xmath31 of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , and compare it with the fe case , as shown in the level diagram in fig .",
    "[ contour]b .",
    "one notices that in contrast to the fe case , the most - preferred magnetization axis of dy is oriented in the out - of - plane direction , while both atoms have their least - preferred axis pointing in the hollow direction .",
    "the mae of dy is basically one order of magnitude larger than that of fe , and is five times larger than the @xmath35mev mae of co on the pt surface @xcite , the largest single - atom mae reported previously .",
    "the previously studied fe on the surface has @xmath36 of spin density extends into the surrounding atoms with the spreading primarily along the n - row direction @xcite .",
    "in contrast to fe , when calculating dy on the same surface , we find that a net spin of @xmath37 is localized at the dy atom , and @xmath37 by including the spin of all atoms , indicating that there is no spin spreading .",
    "the @xmath37 of dy includes two parts of contribution from our analysis , @xmath38 from the localized electronic configuration @xmath39 ( within the dy muffin - tin sphere ) , and @xmath40 from the delocalized @xmath41 ( out of the muffin - tin sphere but within the bader basin ) , where @xmath42 denotes a hybridized molecular orbital @xcite .",
    "the significant reduction of spin spreading when replacing fe by dy is obviously because the dy @xmath2 orbitals are more localized than the fe @xmath43 .",
    "another interesting feature is the shape of the spin density . when looking closely at the spin isosurfaces of the dy and fe atoms along all three crystal - symmetry directions in fig .",
    "[ contour]c , the shapes of dy and fe are found to be approximately a hexagon and a square , respectively , along either the n - row or out - of - plane direction , while both atoms become more round - shape - like along the hollow .",
    "this seemly mysterious observation of spin shapes will become clear when we later look into the fe @xmath43 and dy @xmath2 orbitals in the cun surface .",
    "the @xmath1 orbitals in a crystal environment have the following well - known subshell symmetries , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48",
    ". the exotic , complicated @xmath0 orbitals , which are rarely shown in literatures , have two commonly used sets of subshell symmetries , the cubic and the general sets @xcite . as an example",
    ", we plot the @xmath2 general set in fig .",
    "[ orbital]a .",
    "we find there are four orbitals having a unique six - petal shape : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , and are different from the rest three .",
    "the six - petal shape suggests that the hexagonal spin density is related to the @xmath2 orbitals in some way .",
    "however , the @xmath53 and @xmath54 orbitals that do not have six - petal shapes prevent us from establishing a relation between the spin density and the general - set @xmath2 orbitals . here",
    "we propose an unconventional set of @xmath0 orbitals such that six of the orbitals have fully polarized angular momenta @xmath55 , as one will see its advantages in the orbital analysis of the spin shapes .",
    "five out of the seven orbitals , @xmath56 , @xmath49 , @xmath52 , @xmath51 , and @xmath57 still belong to the general set .",
    "the rest two are @xmath50 and @xmath58 , which are related to the general - set orbitals @xmath53 and @xmath54 simply by the following orthogonal transformation @xmath59    where the primed coordinates are arranged as @xmath60 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which are orthogonally transformed from the general - set @xmath53 and @xmath54 , no longer belong to the general set in the unprimed coordinates , but are actually the general - set orbitals @xmath63 and",
    "@xmath64 in the primed coordinates . one can easily verify that each orbital of this set except for @xmath57 , with its quantization axis @xmath65 properly chosen along one coordinate axis @xmath66 , has its angular momentum fully polarized , that is , they are eigenstates of @xmath67 with eigenvalues @xmath68 . due to the reflection symmetry of these orbitals in the @xmath69 directions ,",
    "their angular - momentum polarization has an sign ambiguity .",
    "the full polarization of @xmath55 of these six @xmath2 orbitals can be further visualized clearly by looking at their orbital shapes . as one can see in fig .",
    "[ orbital]b , the above mentioned six fully - polarized @xmath2 orbitals have an unique six - petal shape , and can be grouped into three pairs .",
    "each pair of orbitals have the same coordinate axis as their central symmetry axis , and are related to each other by exchanging their in - plane axes .",
    "the most obvious full polarization can be realized for the @xmath52 and @xmath51 orbitals , which are eigenstates of @xmath70 with eigenvalues @xmath71 , and have @xmath22 as their central axis .",
    "similarly , each of the rest four fully - polarized orbitals have their central axes as their polarization directions .",
    "the only exception , the @xmath57 orbital , has eight lobes pointing to the corners of a cube .",
    "our calculations show that the dy @xmath2 majority - spin states are all fully occupied and are very low - lying , extremely atomic - like levels .",
    "the orbital analysis of this work does not depend on the details of the dy @xmath2 majority - spin states as long as all of them are fully occupied , and their details are not presented here . for minority - spin states , we plot their pdos in fig .",
    "[ dos]a , and find that @xmath56 and @xmath52 are mainly occupied , and @xmath49 and @xmath51 slightly occupied .",
    "the occupation numbers of the rest of the @xmath2 minority - spin states are negligible .",
    "the @xmath72 electron mentioned in a previous paragraph is mostly delocalized out of the gd muffin - tin sphere , and has a negligible pdos within that sphere .",
    "the dy @xmath2 orbitals are rather localized as indicated from a previous paragraph that they have an approximate @xmath73    radius .",
    "it is a good approximation to think of these orbitals in the way of electronic configurations of an atom , and therefore the nontrivial occupation ( neither fully occupied nor completely empty ) is determined for each orbital from the area under the curve below the fermi level .",
    "the pdos thus implies an approximately @xmath26 configuration for the dy atom itself .",
    "the conventional quantization axes of the fe @xmath43 pdos are oriented in the way that the @xmath20 axis points along the hollow direction , @xmath21 along the n row , and @xmath22 out of plane .",
    "such pdos have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and show that all the majority - spin states are fully occupied .",
    "we re - calculate the pdos and plot the minority spins in fig .",
    "the minority - spin pdos show that @xmath45 is fully occupied , @xmath44 partially occupied , and the rest three minority - spin states basically empty .",
    "the partially occupied spin - minority @xmath44 prohibits us from establishing a simple picture of either the spin - density shape or the soc .",
    "however , one may notice that the @xmath44 and @xmath45 pdos profiles depend nontrivially on the choice ( or interchange ) of the coordinate axes , while the @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( see the insets of fig .  [ dos]b ) have trivially the same set of pdos profiles with interchange of pdos labels corresponding to the interchange of the coordinate axes",
    ". therefore we search for @xmath44 and @xmath45 minority - spin pdos of all three possible assignments of coordinate axes , i.e. , the hollow , n - row , and out - of - plane directions are @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 axes , respectively , and the cyclic permutations . in all three axis assignments ,",
    "all the majority - spin states are always fully occupied , and the @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 minority - spin always empty , while the @xmath44 and @xmath45 minority - spin states have specially simple occupations as shown in fig .",
    "[ dos]b under a particular assignment of new axes : the hollow , n - row , and out - of - plane directions are @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 axes , respectively . in this new coordinate system ,",
    "only the @xmath77 ( or equivalently @xmath78 in the old coordinates ) orbital has paired spins , while the rest four all unpaired .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] .,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]",
    "with the orbital quantum numbers and occupation numbers determined , we now try to explain the spin - density shape of a dy atom on the cun surface . by starting with the top view ,",
    "one notices that the @xmath51 and @xmath52 orbitals both have the six - petal shapes centered about the @xmath22-axis . as we have identified from the pdos analysis that @xmath52 has roughly paired spins , while @xmath51 has roughly an unpaired spin .",
    "the spin density shape along the @xmath46 plane are therefore dominated by the @xmath51 majority spin alone . observing the shape of the @xmath51 orbital",
    ", one then realizes that the hexagonal shape of the dy spin density from a top view in fig .",
    "[ contour]c is essentially the consequence of the unpaired @xmath51 orbital ( see fig .  [",
    "schematic]a ) .",
    "similarly , the @xmath50 and @xmath56 orbitals , both with a six - petal shape centered about the @xmath21-axis , contribute to the hexagonal spin density by looking along the @xmath21 direction . however , the @xmath49 and @xmath58 orbitals , centered about the @xmath20-axis , both have unpaired spins . their two six - petal shapes with @xmath79 relative to each other result in a slightly - round - shape spin - density by looking along the @xmath20 direction .",
    "we can even further understand the unique dent at the @xmath21 ends of the spin isosurface by the following analysis .",
    "the only unpaired orbital that carries a lobe in the @xmath21 direction is @xmath49 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ schematic]a , and all the rest have nodes along @xmath21 .",
    "on the other hand , both the other two axes receive lobe contribution from two unpaired - orbitals , e.g. , @xmath51 and @xmath58 both contribute lobes along @xmath20 . consequently , the spin isosurface shrinks in the @xmath21 direction due to relatively less lobe contribution than the @xmath20 and @xmath22 directions .    the simple occupation picture of the adatom s localized orbitals that explains the spin - density shape works not only for the rare - earth atom dy .",
    "as we are going to show below , the same picture also works for the previously studied fe adatom . when showing the fe pdos in both the conventional quantization axes ( hollow @xmath20 , n - row @xmath21 , and out - of - plane @xmath22 ) and the unconventional ones ( hollow @xmath74 , n - row @xmath75 , and out - of - plane @xmath76 ) in fig .",
    "[ dos]b , we have demonstrated that in the new coordinate system @xmath80 , only the @xmath77 orbital has paired spins , while the rest four are all unpaired . as seen from fig .",
    "[ schematic]b , the square spin - density shapes of fe in the cun surface from the top view and n - row side view are essentially consequences of the spin - unpaired @xmath81 and @xmath82 orbitals , respectively , while the round shape from the hollow - site side view is the combination of the spin - unpaired @xmath83 and @xmath84 orbitals .",
    "one also notice that the spin isosurface has a dent only at the @xmath85 ends .",
    "similar to the way of explaining the dy spin - isosurface dent , such a dent is the consequence that both the @xmath75 and @xmath76 ends have lobe contributions from the @xmath83 orbital , while @xmath74 has no lobe contribution mainly due to the fact that the @xmath77 orbital is spin - paired .",
    "the stm moving - atom technique has demonstrated its capability of building , manipulating , and measuring a single atomic spin in a well - characterized environment .",
    "first - principles calculations conclude that such an atomic spin forms a surface - embedded molecular magnetic structure @xcite , as well as , reproduce the measured magnetic anisotropy axes @xcite . as an ongoing study of the stm - engineered adatoms ,",
    "this work is the first attempt to understand the spin density of a surface magnetic atom in a simple , atomic - scale microscopic picture .",
    "this is achieved by analyzing the occupations , shapes , and angular momenta of its individual localized orbitals .",
    "these localized orbitals include both the well - known @xmath1 orbitals of the transition - metal atoms and the nontrivial @xmath0 of the rare - earth .",
    "we determine an unconventional set of @xmath2 subshell quantum numbers and an unconventional set of @xmath43 quantization axes that can be used to analyze the shape of the spin density .",
    "the spin - density shape of a magnetic adatom is explained by simply counting the occupation of each individual subshell and spin state of the atom s localized orbital .",
    "these studies provide an important microscopic picture of the atomic - scale origins of magnetization distribution .",
    "we have also done the first computational study of a single rare - earth atom on a surface .",
    "the calculation predicts a record - high mae of @xmath86 mev .",
    "all these theoretical and computational realizations , combined with continuing experimental innovations @xcite , may lead to further engineering of the single - atom magnetic anisotropy , further exploration of the smallest magnetic storage bit , and new fascinating applications of atomic - scale magnetism .",
