    "cachazo , svrcek and witten ( csw for short ) reformulated the perturbative calculation of the scattering amplitudes in yang - mills theory by using the off shell mhv vertices @xcite .",
    "the mhv vertices they used are the usual tree level mhv scattering amplitudes in gauge theory @xcite , continued off shell in a particular fashion as given in @xcite .",
    "( for references on perturbative calculations , see for example @xcite .",
    "the 2 dimensional origin of the mhv amplitudes in gauge theory was first given in @xcite . )",
    "some sample calculations were done in @xcite , sometimes with the help of symbolic manipulation .",
    "the correctness of the rules was partially verified by reproducing the known results for small number of gluons @xcite .    in two previous works",
    "@xcite ( for recent works , see @xcite ) , by following the new approach of @xcite , we have computed the generic gluon googly amplitudes and discussed briefly how the csw approach can be extended to theories with fermions ( see also @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we will present the full set of the csw rules for gauge theories with quarks and antiquarks ( fermions in the fundamental representation ) and gluinos ( in supersymmetric theory or fermions in the adjoint representation ) .",
    "although the fermionic amplitudes at tree level can be obtained by supersymmetric ward identities @xcite we think it is still worthy to compute these amplitudes directly .",
    "although the csw rule can be partially understood from the twistor string theory @xcite , a full understanding of the csw approach from the conventional field theory is not reached @xcite .    by using these csw rules with fermions",
    ", we will compute the googly amplitudes with one and two quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "we will also compute the googly amplitudes with 2 gluinos .",
    "for all these amplitudes , we got results which are in agreement with the previously known results .",
    "we note that these googly amplitudes are simply the `` complex conjugate '' of the corresponding mhv amplitudes .",
    "the amplitudes with more than two quark - antiquark pairs are no longer mhv or googly .",
    "nevertheless these amplitudes can be simply computed by using the extended csw rules . as an example we will analyze the purely fermionic amplitudes with 3 quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "there are only 2 different kinds of diagrams and the amplitude can be written down very simply .",
    "we conjecture that this will be the right result for the amplitude .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review the csw rule for gauge theory without fermions . in section 3 , we give the extended csw rules for gauge theories with quarks and gluinos . here",
    "we list all the mhv vertices with fermions . some general relations between the number of vertices and the number of external gluons",
    "are also given .",
    "these relations are particularly useful for analyzing diagrams with fewer number of external gluons with positive helicity .",
    "we will use them to draw the possible diagrams for the purely fermionic amplitudes with 3 quark - antiquark pairs . in section 4 ,",
    "we compute the googly amplitude with one quark - antiquark pair .",
    "there is only 1 external gluon with positive helicity and there can be an arbitrary number of gluons with negative helicity . in section 5 ,",
    "we compute the googly amplitude with 2 quark - antiquark pairs . in section 6 ,",
    "we compute the googly amplitude with 2 gluinos .",
    "the computation for the 4 gluino googly amplitude can also be done and the algebra is more or less the same as before . a technical and lengthy proof in section 4 is relegated to appendix a.",
    "first let us review the rules for calculating tree level gauge theory amplitudes as proposed in @xcite .",
    "here we follow the presentation given in @xcite closely .",
    "we will use the convention that all momenta are outgoing . by mhv ( with gluinos only ) , we always mean an amplitude with precisely two gluons of negative helicity .",
    "if the two gluons of negative helicity are labelled as @xmath0 ( which may be any integers from @xmath1 to @xmath2 ) , the mhv vertices ( or amplitudes ) are given as follows : @xmath3 for an on shell ( massless ) gluon , the momentum in bispinor basis is given as : @xmath4 for an off shell momentum , we can no longer define @xmath5 as above .",
    "the off - shell continuation given in @xcite is to choose an arbitrary spinor @xmath6 and then to define @xmath5 as follows : @xmath7 for an on shell momentum @xmath8 , we will use the notation @xmath9 which is proportional to @xmath5 : @xmath10 as demonstrated in @xcite , it is consistent to use the same @xmath11 for all the off shell lines ( or momenta ) .",
    "the final result is independent of @xmath12 .    by using only mhv vertices",
    ", one can build a tree diagram by connecting mhv vertices with propagators .",
    "for the propagator of momentum @xmath8 , we assign a factor @xmath13 .",
    "any possible diagram ( involving only mhv vertices ) will contribute to the amplitude . as proved in @xcite , a tree level amplitude with @xmath14 external gluons of negative helicity",
    "must be obtained from an mhv tree diagram with @xmath15 vertices .",
    "another relation was given in @xcite , @xmath16 when @xmath17 is the number of the external gluons with positive helicity , and @xmath18 is the number of the vertices with exactly @xmath19 line .",
    "the other relation stated in the above is : @xmath20 from eq .",

    "the rest mhv vertices are all with 3 lines .    for future use",
    ", let us recall 2 formulas presented in @xcite about the off shell amplitude with @xmath23 . when the first particle with momentum @xmath24 is off shell and has positive helicity , the amplitude is @xmath25[3,4]\\cdots [ n-1,n ] } .",

    "there is no disconnected rings of shorter length , like in the color factor @xmath35 @xmath36 .",
    "this can be proved by induction with the number of pairs @xmath31 .",
    "the complete amplitude is obtained first by summing over all possible partitions of @xmath2 gluons into @xmath31 parts and their permutations .",
    "then there is another summation over all possible permutations between quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "if there are identical quark - antiquark pairs , we should do one more summation over all possible permutation between identical antiquarks with a minus sign if the permutation is odd .",
    "of course , the summations of different flavor identical quark - antiquark pairs should be done separately .",
    "+    for a single quark - antiquark pair the color factor is @xmath37 .",

    "[ quarkline ] .",
    "we note that gluon lines are emitted only from one side of the ( connected ) quark - antiquark line .",
    "we will stick to this rule also for multi - pair of quark - antiquark diagrams .",
    "+    there are 2 mhv vertices with quark - antiquarks , one for a single pair of quark - antiquark and one for two quark - antiquark pairs which are shown in fig .",
    "[ mhvall ] .",
    "there is no mhv vertex for 3 or more pair of quark - antiquark .",
    "all these ( non - mhv ) amplitudes should be computed from the above mhv vertices by drawing all possible ( connected ) diagrams with only mhv vertices .",
    "the explicit formulas for these mhv amplitudes are given as follows : @xmath42 for the single pair of quark - antiquark , and for 2 quark - antiquark pairs : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is given as follows : @xmath45 all these mhv amplitudes are given in terms of the `` holomorphic '' spinors of the external ( on - shell ) momenta .",
    "so we can use the same off shell continuation given in @xcite which we recalled in section 2 . by including these fermionic mhv vertices",
    ", we can extend the csw rule of perturbative gauge theory to gauge theories with quarks and antiquarks .",
    "the propagator for both gluon and fermion ( quark or antiquark ) internal lines is just @xmath13 , as explained in @xcite .",
    "the only peculiarity with fermions is that helicity is conserved along a fermion line .",
    "because we assume that all quarks have different flavor , the flowing of arrows must follow the directions given exactly in fig .",
    "[ mhvall ] .",
    "let us assume that in an mhv diagram , there are @xmath18 purely gluonic mhv vertices with @xmath19-lines , @xmath46 single pair of quark - antiquark mhv vertices with @xmath47-lines ( counting also the 2 fermion lines , so actually only @xmath19 gluon lines ) , and @xmath48 2 pairs of quark - antiquark mhv vertices with @xmath49-lines ( counting also the 4 fermion lines , so actually only @xmath19 gluon lines ) . for a connected diagram with @xmath50 quark - antiquark pairs ,",

    ", we refer to @xcite .    for supersymmetric theories ,",
    "there are also gluinos , the super partners of the gluons .",
    "because the gluinos are in the same adjoint representation as the gluons , the color decomposition for amplitudes with both gluons and gluinos would be the same as for purely gluon amplitudes . compared with gauge theory with quark - antiquarks",
    ", there is no difference between gluino and its antiparticle .",
    "so we should include also diagrams with gluon lines emitted from both sides of the gluino lines .",
    "the gluino mhv amplitudes can be obtained by using the recursive relation in @xcite or by using the supersymmetric ward identity @xcite and are recalled here .",

    "the other case when the positive helicity gluino is in front of the negative helicity gluino can be obtained from the above formula by cyclic permutation .",
    "one should only note that there is an extra @xmath65 sign when we change the order of two fermions because of fermi statistics .",
