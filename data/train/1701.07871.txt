    "in the era of the internet of things ( iot ) , it is expected that @xmath0 billion wireless communication devices will be connected worldwide @xcite .",
    "smart physical objects equipped with sensors and wireless communication chips are able to collect and exchange information .",
    "these smart objects are wirelessly connected to computing systems to provide intelligent everyday services such as e - health , automated control , energy management ( smart city and smart grid ) , logistics , security control , and safety management , etc .",
    "however , the limited energy storage capacity of battery - powered wireless communication devices severely limits the lifetime of wireless communication networks .",
    "although battery replacement provides an intermediate solution to energy shortage , frequent replacement of batteries can be costly and cumbersome .",
    "this creates a serious performance bottleneck in providing stable communication services . on the other hand , a promising approach",
    "to extend the lifetime of wireless communication networks is to equip wireless communication devices with energy harvesting ( eh ) technology to scavenge energy from external sources .",
    "solar , wind , tidal , biomass , and geothermal are the major renewable energy sources for generating electricity @xcite . yet , these conventional natural energy sources are usually climate and location dependent which limits the mobility of the wireless devices . more importantly , the intermittent and uncontrollable nature of these natural energy sources is a major obstacle for providing stable wireless communications via traditional eh technologies .",
    "recently , wireless energy transfer ( wet ) has attracted significant attention from both academia and industry @xcite@xcite , as a key to unlock the potential of iot .",
    "generally speaking , the wet technology can be divided into three categories : magnetic resonant coupling , inductive coupling , and radio frequency ( rf)-based wet .",
    "the first two technologies rely on near - field magnetic fields and do not support any mobility of eh devices , due to the short wireless charging distances and the required alignment of the magnetic field with the eh circuits . in contrast , rf - based wet technologies @xcite@xcite utilize the far - field of electromagnetic ( em ) waves which enables concurrent wireless charging and data communication in wet networks over long distances ( e.g. hundreds of metres ) .",
    "moreover , the broadcast nature of wireless channels facilitates one - to - many wireless charging which eliminates the need for power cords and manual recharging for iot devices . as a result",
    ", simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) is expected to be a key enabler for sustainable iot communication networks . yet",
    ", the introduction of swipt to communication systems has led to a paradigm shift in both system architecture and resource allocation algorithm design .",
    "for instance , in swipt systems , one can increase the energy of the information carrying signal to increase the amount of rf energy harvested at the receivers .",
    "however , increasing the power of the information signals may also increase their susceptibility to eavesdropping , due to the higher potential for information leakage . as a result",
    ", both communication security concerns and the need for efficient wet naturally arise in systems providing swipt services .    nowadays ,",
    "various types of cryptographic encryption algorithms are employed at the application layer for guaranteeing wireless communication security .",
    "however , secure secret key management and distribution via an authenticated third party is typically required for these algorithms , which may not be realizable in future wireless iot networks due to the expected massive numbers of devices . therefore , a considerable amount of work has recently been devoted to information - theoretic physical ( phy ) layer security as a complementary technology to the existing encryption algorithms @xcite@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in a wire - tap channel , if the source - destination channel enjoys better conditions compared to the source - eavesdropper channel @xcite , perfectly secure communication between a source and a destination is possible .",
    "hence , multiple - antenna technology and advanced signal processing algorithms have been proposed to ensure secure communications .",
    "specifically , by exploiting the extra degrees of freedom offered by multiple antennas , the information beams can be focused on the desired legitimate receivers to reduce the chance of information leakage . besides , artificial noise can be injected into the communication channel deliberately to degrade the channel quality of eavesdroppers .",
    "these concepts have also been extended to swipt systems to provide secure communication . in @xcite ,",
    "beamforming was studied to enhance security and power efficiency in swipt systems .",
    "the authors of @xcite proposed a multi - objective optimization framework to investigate the non - trivial tradeoff between interference , total harvested power , and energy consumption in a secure cognitive radio swipt network .",
    "however , the resource allocation algorithms designed for secure swipt systems @xcite were based on a linear eh model which does not capture the highly non - linear characteristics of practical end - to - end wet @xcite@xcite . in particular ,",
    "existing resource allocation schemes designed for the linear eh model may lead to severe resource allocation mismatches resulting in performance degradation in wet and secure communications .",
    "these observations motivate us to study the design of efficient resource allocation algorithms for secure swipt systems taking into account a practical non - linear eh model .",
    "the ers harvest wireless energy from the rf signal and are treated as potential eavesdroppers by the base station . ,",
