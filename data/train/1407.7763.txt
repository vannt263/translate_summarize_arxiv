    ", we can also state this difficulty as follows : it is _ not _ true that whenever  @xmath104 is a graph satisfying @xmath110 , there is a short ( i.e. , @xmath107-length ) proof of the statement `` @xmath110 '' .",
    "max - cut is perhaps the simplest nontrivial _ constraint satisfaction problem ( csp)_. rather than formally defining this class of problems , we ll simply give two more examples .",
    "in the _ max-3lin _",
    "problem , given is a system of equations over  @xmath111 , each of the form `` @xmath112 '' ; the task is to find an assignment to the variables @xmath113 so as to maximize the fraction of satisfied equations . in the _ max-3coloring _ problem ,",

    "there is a simple greedy algorithm that is @xmath122-approximating for max - cut ; i.e. , given a bipartite  @xmath104 , it finds a bipartition .",
    "similarly , one can efficiently @xmath122-approximate max-3lin using gaussian elimination . on the other hand , @xmath122-approximating max-3coloring  i.e. , validly @xmath114-coloring @xmath114-colorable graphs  is @xmath106-hard .",
    "for max-3lin the near - trivial algorithm of outputting @xmath123 , where @xmath62 is the more common `` right - hand side '' of the system , is a @xmath124-approximation for every  @xmath125 .",
    "one can also get an efficient @xmath124-approximation for max - cut ( for any  @xmath126 ) either by a simple greedy algorithm , or by outputting a _ random _ partition @xmath127 . the classical statement that `` max - cut is @xmath106-hard '' is equivalent to stating that _ there exists _",

    "it is a rather astonishing fact that the trivial approximation algorithms mentioned above are best possible assuming @xmath108 ; this is a celebrated result of hstad  @xcite combining `` pcp technology ''  @xcite and fourier analysis of boolean functions :    [ thm : hastad ] for any @xmath130 , it s @xmath106-hard to @xmath131-approximate max-3lin",
    ".    for quite a long time , it was not known how to do any better even for the much simpler problem of max - cut .",
    "this changed in 1994 with the famous and sophisticated result of goemans and williamson  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) :    [ thm : gw ] there is an efficient algorithm that @xmath132-approximates max - cut for every @xmath133 $ ] , where @xmath134 is the positive solution of @xmath135 .",
    "e.g. , the goemans ",

    "( variants of the goemans  williamson algorithm that perform well for @xmath139 are also known . )        briefly , the algorithm works as follows : given a graph @xmath99 , one considers the following _ semidefinite programming _ optimization problem : @xmath140 \\\\      \\text{subject to } & \\quad \\vec{u } \\co v \\to s^{d-1}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here one also maximizes over all @xmath141 , although one can show that it suffices to take @xmath142 .",
    "essentially , the optimization problem   seeks to assign a unit vector to each vertex in  @xmath143 so that edges in  @xmath104 are spread as far apart as possible .",
    "it s easy to see that if @xmath85 is fixed to  @xmath6 ( so that @xmath144 ) then   is identical to the max - cut problem ; therefore @xmath145 always .",
    "surprisingly , although computing @xmath103 is intractable , one can efficiently compute @xmath146 .",
    "( roughly speaking , the reason is that if we introduce real variables @xmath147 , then   is equivalent to maximizing a linear function of the @xmath148 s over an explicit convex subset of @xmath149 , namely the set of all positive semidefinite matrices @xmath150 with @xmath6 s on the diagonal . )",
    "thus   gives us an efficiently - computable upper bound on  @xmath103 .",
    "one may hope that it is a relatively `` good '' upper bound , and that furthermore one can prove this constructively by providing an efficient algorithm which converts the optimum `` vector solution '' @xmath151 to a good `` @xmath47 solution '' @xmath152  i.e. , a good bipartition of  @xmath143 .",
    "goemans and williamson fulfilled this hope , as follows : their algorithm first chooses @xmath84 to be a standard @xmath85-dimensional gaussian and then it outputs the bipartition of  @xmath104 defined by @xmath153 . using sheppard s formula",
    ", it s not hard to show that this establishes theorem  [ thm : gw ] .    the goemans ",
    "williamson algorithm was originally considered to be quite complex for such a simple csp as max - cut ; furthermore , its approximation guarantee seemed quite peculiar .",
    "more than one paper  @xcite suggested the research goal of improving this approximation guarantee .",
    "furthermore , the best known @xmath106-hardness result for the problem ( from  @xcite ) does not match the algorithm .",

    "nevertheless , in 2004 khot et al .",
    "@xcite obtained the following `` surprising ''",
    "@xcite result : under the _ unique games conjecture _  @xcite ( a notorious conjecture in computational complexity not related to max - cut ) , the majority is stablest theorem implies that there is no efficient algorithm beating the goemans  williamson approximation guarantee ( at least for @xmath133 $ ] ; see  @xcite for optimal results when @xmath139 ) .",
    "we remark that the while the unique games conjecture is believable , its status is vastly more uncertain than the @xmath108 conjecture .",

    "the advantage of the unique games conjecture ( as opposed to just the @xmath108 assumption ) is that it makes the `` hstad pcp technology '' much easier to use .",
    "very roughly speaking , it implies that to establish intractability of beating @xmath132-approximation , it suffices to find certain so - called `` gadget graphs '' for the max - cut problem . precisely speaking",
    ", these gadget graphs need to have the following properties :    * the vertex set @xmath143 should be @xmath159 .",

    "such gadget graphs have the first two properties above , and the majority is stablest theorem precisely implies that they also have the third property .",

    "in particular , _ if _   were to hold for one - bit functions @xmath400 $ ] then we could deduce it for general @xmath401 $ ] by induction , then for gaussian @xmath402 $ ] by the central limit theorem , and finally for gaussian @xmath395 $ ] by induction again .",
    "unfortunately , the inequality   does _ not _ hold for @xmath403 $ ] .",
    "it s clear that it ca nt , because otherwise we would obtain the majority is stablest theorem with no hypothesis about small influences ( which is false ) .",
    "indeed , the `` dictator '' functions @xmath403 $ ] , @xmath404 provide an immediate counterexample ; inequality   becomes the false statement @xmath405 .",
    "nevertheless , as noted by de , mossel , and neeman  @xcite we are back in the situation wherein   `` essentially '' holds for one - bit functions `` with small influences '' ; i.e. , for @xmath406 , @xmath407 with @xmath408 `` small '' . to see this , taylor - expand the left - hand side of   around  @xmath118 : @xmath409      & = \\lambda_\\rho(\\alpha,\\beta ) + \\e[\\delta_1 \\bx \\cdot \\d_1 \\lambda_\\rho(\\alpha,\\beta ) ] + \\e[\\delta_2 \\bx ' \\cdot \\d_2 \\lambda_\\rho(\\alpha,\\beta ) ] \\nonumber\\\\      & + \\",
    "\\e\\left[\\begin{bmatrix } \\delta_1 \\bx & \\delta_2 \\bx ' \\end{bmatrix } \\cdot h\\lambda_\\rho(\\alpha,\\beta )   \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix } \\delta_1 \\bx \\\\",
    "\\delta_2 \\bx ' \\end{bmatrix}\\right ] + \\cdots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( here @xmath410 denotes the hessian of @xmath399 . ) the first term here matches the right - hand side of  .",
    "the second and third terms vanish , since @xmath411 = \\e[\\bx ' ] = 0 $ ] .",
    "finally , since @xmath412 = \\rho$ ] the fourth term is @xmath413 one can show by a relatively short calculation that @xmath414 is identically  @xmath271 and that the diagonal entries of @xmath415 always have opposite sign to  @xmath21 .",
    "thus for @xmath42 , the matrix @xmath415 is everywhere negative semidefinite and hence   is always nonpositive .",
    "( the reverse happens for @xmath42 . )",
    "ledoux  @xcite introduced the terminology _",
    "@xmath21-concavity of  @xmath392 _ for the condition @xmath416 .",
    "it follows that   indeed holds for one - bit boolean functions @xmath417 , up to the `` cubic error term '' elided in  .",
    "if one now does the induction while keeping these cubic error terms around , the result is the following :    [ thm : dmn ] fix @xmath42 and any small @xmath418 .",
    "then for @xmath419 $ ] , @xmath420 \\leq \\lambda_{\\rho}(\\e[f(\\bx ) ] , \\e[g(\\by ) ] ) + o_{\\rho , \\eta}(1 ) \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^n   ( \\|\\mathrm{d}_i f\\|_3 ^ 3 + \\|\\mathrm{d}_i g\\|_3 ^ 3),\\ ] ] where @xmath421 denotes the _ @xmath68th martingale difference _ for  @xmath195 , @xmath422 - \\e[h \\mid \\bx_1 , \\dots , \\bx_{i-1}].\\ ] ] ( for @xmath98 , the inequality   is reversed . )    with this theorem in hand , borell s isoperimetric inequality for gaussian functions @xmath423 $ ] is easily deduced by the standard central limit theorem argument : one only needs to check that the cubic error term is  @xmath424 , and  @xmath1 may be taken arbitrarily large .",
    "then one immediately deduces the full borell theorem by taking @xmath425 and doing another induction on the gaussian dimension  @xmath85 . on top of this ,",
    "de , mossel , and neeman showed how to deduce majority is stablest from theorem  [ thm : dmn ] , using a small collection of analytical tricks appearing in the original proof .",
    "the key trick is to use hypercontractivity to bound @xmath426 in terms of @xmath427^{1+\\delta}\\ ] ] for some small @xmath428 .",
    "the fact that we get the nontrivial extra factor @xmath71^{\\delta}$ ] , which is at most @xmath429 by assumption , is the key to finishing the proof .",
    "as mentioned , there are two known proofs of the majority is stablest theorem : the original one , which used the invariance principle to reduce the problem to borell s isoperimetric inequality ; and , the elegant one due to de , mossel , and neeman , which is a completely `` discrete proof '' , as befits a purely discrete problem like majority is stablest .",
    "esthetics is not the only merit of the latter proof , however ; as we describe in this section , the fact that the de  mossel  neeman proof is simpler and more discrete leads to new technical results concerning the computational complexity of max - cut .    regarding max - cut ,",
    "let s consider the closely related problem of _ certifying _ that a given graph has no large cut . as we saw in section  [ sec : max - cut ] , for any graph  @xmath104 we can use semidefinite programming to efficiently compute a value @xmath430 such that the maximum cut in @xmath104 satisfies @xmath110 .",
    "we think of this algorithm as producing a _ proof _ of the statement `` @xmath110 '' .",
    "furthermore , the ( analysis of the ) goemans  williamson algorithm implies that the bound found by this algorithm is fairly good ; whenever @xmath104 truly satisfies @xmath431 ( for @xmath133 $ ] ) , we will efficiently obtain a proof of `` @xmath432 '' .",
    "for example , if @xmath433 then there is an efficiently - obtainable `` sdp proof '' of the statement `` @xmath434 '' .",
    "assuming the unique games conjecture ( and @xmath108 ) , the works  @xcite imply that there is no efficient algorithm that can in general find better proofs ; e.g. , that can certify `` @xmath435 '' whenever @xmath433 .",
    "in fact , under the additional standard assumption of @xmath109 , the implication is simply that no short proofs _ exist _ ; i.e. , there are infinite families of graphs @xmath99 with @xmath433 but no @xmath107-length proof of the statement `` @xmath435 '' ( say , in some textbook formalization of mathematical reasoning ) .",
    "in other words :          in fact , there are infinitely many graphs  @xmath104 with @xmath431 , yet for which no polynomial - length proof of `` @xmath436 '' exists . + as mentioned , the unique games conjecture is quite contentious , so it s important to seek additional evidence concerning the above predictions . for example , to support the first prediction one should at a minimum show that the semidefinite program   fails to provide such proofs .",
    "that is , one should find graphs  @xmath104 with @xmath431 yet @xmath437 .",
    "such graphs are called _ sdp integrality gap instances _ , as they exhibit a large gap between their true optimal max - cut and the upper - bound certified by the sdp .",
    "borell s isoperimetric inequality precisely provides such graphs , at least if `` weighted continuous graphs '' are allowed : one takes the `` graph '' @xmath104 whose vertex set is  @xmath183 and whose `` edge measure '' is given by choosing a @xmath167-correlated pair of gaussians . the fact that @xmath431 is immediate from borell s theorem  [ thm : gaussian - mist ]",
    "; further , it s not hard to show ( using the idea of remark  [ rem : sphere - idea ] ) that choosing @xmath438 in   establishes @xmath439 .",
    "these facts were essentially established originally by feige and schechtman  @xcite , who also showed how to discretize the construction so as to provide finite integrality gap graphs .",
    "( incidentally , we may now explain that the raghavendra theory mentioned at the end of section  [ sec : max - cut ] significantly generalizes the work of khot et al .",
    "@xcite by showing how to transform an sdp integrality gap instance for _ any _ csp into a matching computational hardness - of - approximation result , assuming the unique games conjecture . )",
    "although the semidefinite program   fails to certify @xmath431 for the `` correlated gaussian graphs '' described above , a great deal of recent research has gone into developing stronger `` proof systems '' for reasoning about max - cut and other csps .",
    "( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a survey . ) actually , until recently this research was viewed not in terms of proof complexity but in terms of analyzing `` tighter '' sdp relaxations that can still be solved efficiently .",
    "for example , one can still solve the optimization problem   in polynomial time with the following `` triangle inequality '' constraint added in : @xmath440 note that with this additional constraint we still have @xmath145 for all  @xmath104 , because the constraint is satisfied by any genuine bipartition @xmath441 . as noted by feige and schechtman  @xcite , adding this constraint gives a certification better than `` @xmath432 '' for the gaussian correlation graphs , though it s not clear by how much .",
    "although this stronger `` sdp + triangle inequality '' proof system does better on gaussian correlation graphs , a breakthrough work of khot and vishnoi  @xcite showed that it still suffers from the same integrality gap for a different infinite family of graphs .",
    "in other words , even when the sdp includes the triangle inequalities , these _ khot  vishnoi graphs _  @xmath99 have @xmath437 yet @xmath442 .",
    "the second fact , the upper bound on the true max - cut value , relies directly on the majority is stablest theorem .",
    "subsequent works  @xcite significantly generalized this result by showing that even much tighter `` sdp hierarchies '' still fail to certify anything better than `` @xmath432 '' for the khot  vishnoi graphs  @xmath104 .",
    "this could be considered additional evidence in favor of the unique games & @xmath108 prediction concerning max - cut .    a recent work by barak et al .",
    "@xcite cast some doubt on this prediction , however .",
    "their work showed that the especially strong `` lasserre / parrilo sdp hierarchy ''  @xcite succeeds in finding some good csp bounds which weaker sdp hierarchies are unable to obtain .",
    "specifically , they showed it provides good upper bounds on the optimal value of the khot ",
    "vishnoi `` unique games instances '' ( which are , in some sense , subcomponents of the khot  vishnoi max - cut graphs ) .",
    "subsequent work of odonnell and zhou  @xcite further emphasized the equivalence of the lasserre / parrilo sdp hierarchy and the _ sum - of - squares ( sos ) proof system _ , invented by grigroriev and vorobjov  @xcite . in the context of the max - cut csp",
    ", this proof system ( inspired by hilbert s  17th problem  @xcite and the _ positivstellensatz _ of krivine  @xcite and stengle  @xcite ) seeks to establish the statement `` @xmath110 '' for a graph @xmath99 by expressing @xmath443/(x_v^2 - 1)_{v \\in v},\\ ] ] for some formal polynomials @xmath444 of degree at most some constant  @xmath63 .",
    "somewhat remarkably , there is an efficient ( @xmath445-time ) algorithm for finding such @xmath446 s whenever they exist .",
    "as mentioned , for the khot  vishnoi max - cut graphs  @xmath104 , the fact that @xmath447 follows directly from the majority is stablest theorem . to show that the sos proof system can also certify this fact ( thereby casting some doubt on the unique games & @xmath108 prediction about max - cut )",
    ", one needs to show that not only is the majority is stablest theorem true , but that it can be proved within the extremely constrained sos proof system ,   la  .",
    "the original proof of the majority is stablest theorem was quite complicated , using the invariance principle from  @xcite to reduce borell s isoperimetric inequality , and then relying on the known geometric proofs  @xcite of the latter .",
    "the prospect for converting this proof into an sos format seemed quite daunting ( although a partial result was established in  @xcite , showing that the sos proof system can establish `` @xmath448 '' ) .",
    "however , the simplicity and discrete nature of the new de  mossel  neeman proof of the majority is stablest theorem allowed them to show that the sos proof system _ can _ establish the truth about the khot  vishnoi graphs , @xmath449 .",
    "it is to be hoped that this result can be extended to the entire raghavendra theory , thereby showing that the sos proof system can certify the optimal value of the analogue of the khot ",
    "vishnoi instances for _ all _ csps .",
    "however as the raghavendra theory still relies on the invariance principle , whether or not this is possible is unclear .",
    "finally , in light of the de  mossel - neeman result , the following interesting question is open : are there ( infinite families of ) instances of the max - cut problem  @xmath104 such that @xmath431 , yet such that any mathematical proof of this statement is so complicated that the sos proof system can not establish anything better than `` @xmath432 '' ? if such graphs were found , this might tilt the weight of evidence back in favor of the unique games & @xmath108 prediction . of course , if human mathematicians explicitly construct the proof of @xmath431 , presumably it will have polynomial length , and therefore not provide any evidence in favor of the unique games & @xmath109 prediction . to provide evidence for this stronger prediction ,",
