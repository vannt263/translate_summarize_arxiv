    "spreading processes widely exist in various fields including physics , chemistry , medical science , biology and sociology  @xcite .",
    "for example , reaction diffusion processes  @xcite , pandemics  @xcite , cascading failures in electric power grids  @xcite and information dissemination  @xcite can be naturally described by the framework of spreading . in the past decade , spreading on complex networks has been intensively studied .",
    "studies have revealed that the spreading results is strongly influenced by the network topologies  @xcite . with these understanding ,",
    "some network manipulating methods are designed to hinder spreading in the case of diseases or accelerate spreading in the case of information dissemination  @xcite .",
    "recently , more and more attention has been paid to the microscopic level when studying the spreading process on networks  @xcite .",
    "since the local structure around each node can be very different , the final spreading coverage varies from several nodes to the entire network when the propagation originates from distinct nodes .",
    "so far , many methods , such as the k - shell  @xcite and the leaderrank  @xcite , have been proposed to rank the spreading ability of the nodes ( i.e. , how many nodes will finally be reached when the spreading originates from this single node ) .",
    "a fundamental problem related to the spreading process is how to infer the network topology from the observation of the spreading results .",
    "if this question is answered , we could , for instance , have a better understanding of the organization of the terrorists ( social networks ) and the structure of some biology systems ( metabolic networks ) .",
    "since building the relation between the dynamics and network structure is a crucial problem , much effort has been made in this direction  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors design a method to reconstruct the network based on the observation of some oscillation taking place on networks .",
    "moreover , noise is found to lead to a general , one - to - one correspondence between the dynamical correlation and the network connections  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the oscillation is also used to predict the missing nodes in network  @xcite .",
    "even though the spreading process widely exist in many real systems , so far little has been investigated in the literature about inferring network topology based on the spreading .",
    "the closest studies are ref .",
    "@xcite where the spreading results are used to identify the initial spreader of certain disease or information .    in this paper , we proposed a simple method to uncover the network topology .",
    "the basic idea is that the similarity between nodes can be estimated based on the spreading results .",
    "we test our method in two well - known artificial network models .",
    "the results shows that our method has a high accuracy in inferring network topology .",
    "moreover , the infection rate of the spreading is found to significantly influence the inferring accuracy and each network has an optimal infection rate .",
    "we also validate our method in both real social and nonsocial networks .",
    "finally , we design a new similarity measure and extend our method to directed networks . the new similarity measure is shown to remarkably improve the inferring accuracy compared to the existing similarity measures .",
    "we consider a network with @xmath0 nodes and @xmath1 links .",
    "the network is represented by an adjacency matrix @xmath2 , where @xmath3 if there is a link between node @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and @xmath6 otherwise . to simulate the spreading process on networks ,",
    "we employ the sir model  @xcite .",
    "actually , this model has been used to simulate many different propagation process . without losing any generality , we consider the online information spreading as an example in this paper .",
    "we assume that each user has probability @xmath7 to submit a news .",
    "as such , there will be @xmath8 news propagating in the network .",
    "after a news / story @xmath9 is submitted ( or received ) by a user , it will infect each of this user s susceptible neighbors with probability @xmath10 . after infecting neighbors ,",
    "the user will immediately get recovered .",
    "all the users who received ( or get infected by ) @xmath9 at the end will be recorded . for each user @xmath4 ,",
    "the set of news / story that she received is denoted as @xmath11 .",
    "in the following , we will describe the method we used to infer the network topology based on the news propagation process .",
    "the basic idea is that the news / stories received by users can be used to estimate the similarity between them ( nodes ) .",
    "we assume that the nodes with higher similarity are more likely to be connected in networks .",
    "therefore , the obtained similarity @xmath12 can be regarded as the likelihood score @xmath13 for two nodes to have a link , i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "actually , the similarity @xmath12 is subject to different definition . here",
    "we consider some well - known similarity definitions as follows .",
    "\\(i ) _ common neighbours ( cn)_-by common sense , two nodes , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are more likely to have a link if they received many same news / stories .",
    "the simplest measure of this neighbourhood overlap is the directed count , namely @xmath15    ( ii)_salton index ( si)_-the salton index  @xcite is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 the number of news received by user @xmath4 .",
    "\\(iii ) _ jaccard index ( ji)_-this index was proposed by jaccard over a hundred years ago  @xcite , and is defined as @xmath18    \\(iv ) _ sorensen index ( ssi)_-this index is used mainly for ecological community data  @xcite , and is defined as @xmath19    \\(v ) _ hub promoted index ( hpi)_-this index is proposed for quantifying the topological overlap of pairs of substrates in metabolic networks  @xcite , and is defined as @xmath20    \\(vi ) _ hub depressed index ( hdi)_-there is a measure with the opposite effect on hubs , which is @xmath21    \\(vii ) _ leicht - holme - newman index ( lhn)_-this index assigns high similarity to node pairs that have many common neighbours compared to the expected number of such neighbours  @xcite . it is defined as @xmath22    \\(viii ) _ resource allocation index ( ra)_-the similarity between @xmath4 and @xmath5 is defined as the amount of resource @xmath5 received from @xmath4  @xcite , which is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of users who finally received news @xmath9 .    as a benchmark",
    ", we compare the similarity - based method with the well - known preferential attachment ( pa ) process .",
    "the mechanism of preferential attachment has been used to generate evolving scale - free networks , where the probability that a new link is connected to the node @xmath4 is proportional to @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "based on this network growing mechanism , the likelihood score for two nodes to have a link can be calculated as @xmath26 .",
    "to measure the accuracy of the method in inferring the network topology , we use the standard metric of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( auc )  @xcite . in the network topology inference problem , there are four possible outcomes from the prediction . a true positive ( tp ) is the prediction of a link that exists in the real network , and if the link does nt exist in the real network then it is called a false positive ( fp ) .",
    "conversely , a true negative ( tn ) means that a link that does nt exist in the real network is not predicted , and a false negative ( fn ) is the lack of prediction of a link that actually exists in the real network .    to draw the receiver operating characteristic curve ( roc ) curve ,",
    "only the true positive rate ( tpr ) and false positive rate ( fpr ) are needed .",
    "the tpr defines how many tp occur among all tp and fn samples available during the test . on the other hand",
    ", fpr defines how many fp occur among all fp and tn samples available during the test .",
    "the roc curve is created by plotting tpr vs. fpr at various threshold settings .",
    "when using normalized units , the area under the roc curve ( auc ) is equal to the probability that a true link has a higher score than a nonexisting link .    in this paper , we use a simple way to calculate auc .",
    "we pick a true link and a nonexisting link in the network and compare their scores .",
    "if , among @xmath27 pairs , the real link has a higher likelihood score @xmath13 than the nonexisting link @xmath28 times and equal score @xmath29 times , the auc value is as follows : @xmath30 .",
    "note that , if links were ranked at random , the auc value would be equal to @xmath31 . by reanalyzing the following results with another accuracy measure",
    ", we verify that the performance of the methods is not strongly influenced by the accuracy measure we used .",
    "therefore , we only present the results of auc in next section .     in the parameter space ( @xmath10 , @xmath7 ) for ( a ) ws networks ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) and ( b ) ba networks ( @xmath32 , @xmath34 ) .",
    "the results are averaged over @xmath35 independent realizations.,width=453 ]",
    "we first test our method in two artificial network models : ( i ) watts - strogatz networks ( ws )  @xcite , ( ii ) barabasi - albert networks ( ba )  @xcite .",
    "when implementing our method , we select the jaccard similarity definition as an example here . fig .",
    "1 shows the @xmath36 in the parameter space ( @xmath10 , @xmath7 ) for both ws and ba networks . actually ,",
    "both @xmath10 and @xmath7 control the amount of data we can obtain from the spreading process . if @xmath10 is too small , the news can only propagate several steps and the data for similarity calculation will be limited .",
    "if @xmath7 is small , only a few news are propagating in the network and the obtained similarity matrix will be sparse as well .",
    "the first crucial observation in fig.1 is that the surface of @xmath36 has a pronounced maximum around @xmath37 in ws networks and @xmath38 in ba networks for all values of @xmath7 .",
    "as discussed above , a small @xmath10 will result in a sparse similarity matrix and eventually lead to a poor @xmath36 . in the case of large @xmath10 values ,",
    "the spreading will cover almost all the network .",
    "consequently , the information of local network structure can not embed in the spreading results .",
    "the optimal @xmath10 is somehow close to the critical infection rate for the spreading coverage  @xcite .",
    "compared to @xmath10 , the influences of @xmath7 on @xmath36 is smaller . even though @xmath36 keeps",
    "increasing with @xmath7 , the increasing speed becomes significantly slower once @xmath7 is larger than @xmath39 .",
    "next , we move to investigate how the network structure properties influences the inferring accuracy . from fig . 1",
    ", we can already see that @xmath36 in ba networks is lower than that in ws networks , which indicates that it is generally easier to infer the network with homogeneous degree distribution .",
    "furthermore , we study the effect of average degree on the inferring accuracy in detail , with results reported in fig .",
    "fig.2 ( a ) and ( b ) show that as the average degree @xmath40 increases , the curve of auc shifts to the left in both networks . in fig .",
    "2(c ) and ( d ) , we can see that both the optimal @xmath41 and maximum @xmath42 decrease with @xmath40 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath41 is very stable under different @xmath7 . in ws networks",
    ", @xmath41 stays almost unchanged when changing @xmath7 .",
    "in ba network , @xmath41 slightly decreases as @xmath7 increases .",
    "on @xmath10 under different @xmath40 in ( a ) ws networks ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) and ( b ) ba networks ( @xmath32 ) , respectively .",
    "( c ) and ( d ) shows the relation between the optimal @xmath41 and @xmath40 under different @xmath7 in ws networks and ba networks , respectively .",
    "the inset in ( c ) and ( d ) are the relation between the maximum @xmath42 and @xmath40 under different @xmath7 .",
    "the results are averaged over @xmath35 independent realizations.,width=453 ]    we further apply our method on the artificial networks with different size .",
    "we present the maximum @xmath42 ( with respect to optimal @xmath41 ) against @xmath0 under different @xmath10 in fig .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "interestingly , the inferring accuracy constantly increases with the network size .",
    "the curve with the optimal @xmath41 enjoys the largest slope ( @xmath43 in ws networks and @xmath44 in ba networks ) .",
    "however , the slope slowly becomes smaller as @xmath0 increases . in fig .",
    "3(c ) and ( d ) , we report the maximum @xmath42 against @xmath0 under different @xmath7 .",
    "the results show that @xmath7 can always improve @xmath42 .",
    "( with respect to optimal @xmath41 ) against @xmath0 under different @xmath10 in ( a ) ws networks ( @xmath45 , @xmath33 ) and ( b ) ba networks ( @xmath45 ) , respectively .",
    "( c ) and ( d ) show the maximum @xmath42 against @xmath0 under different @xmath7 in ws and ba networks , respectively .",
    "the results are averaged over @xmath35 independent realizations.,width=453 ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      actually , our method can be easily extended to directed networks . however , all the similarity measures discussed above are symmetric ( i.e. @xmath46 ) .",
    "it implies that if a directed link exists , the link in the other directed will exist as well .",
    "this will largely lower the accuracy . to solve the problem , we proposed an asymmetric similarity ( as ) measure for inferring the network topology in directed networks .",
    "mathematically , it can be expressed as @xmath47 a large @xmath12 indicates that @xmath5 received most of the news / stories passing through @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , it is more likely to have a directed link from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "we considered several real directed network to validate our method .",
    "the networks include prisoners ( friendship network between prisoners with @xmath48 nodes and @xmath49 links )  @xcite , sm fw ( food web network in st .",
    "mark area with @xmath50 nodes and @xmath51 links )  @xcite , lr fw ( food web network in little rock area with @xmath52 nodes and @xmath53 links )  @xcite , neural ( the neural network of c. elegans with @xmath54 nodes and @xmath55 links )  @xcite , metabolic ( the metabolic network of c. elegans with @xmath56 nodes and @xmath57 links )  @xcite , pb ( the hyper link between the blogs of politicians with @xmath58 nodes and @xmath59 links )  @xcite .",
    "again , we observe that the inferring accuracy of similarity - based method is higher than the preferential attachment method .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath60 performs best among all the similarity measures .",
    "the results indicate that the asymmetric feature is crucial for inferring network topology in directed networks .    like in undirected networks ,",
    "we examine the performance of different similarity metrics in directed network with the non - uniform spreading parameters and localized initial condition .",
    "we observe that the accuracy is largely lowered . generally speaking , the virus / information is more difficult to propagate in these networks due to the directionality of the links .",
    "therefore , the virus is very likely to stay in the local region under the localized initial condition , which results in a very sparse similarity matrix for inferring network topology and thus a much lower auc .",
    "the phenomenon is even more serious in some acyclic networks ( such as sm food web and lr food web ) .",
    "to summarize , we propose a method to infer the network topology based on the spreading process on networks .",
    "specifically , the similarity between nodes are estimated by the information / virus that nodes received , and the nodes with the highest similarity are assumed to be connected .",
    "we tested our method in classic artificial network models and find that our method enjoys high inferring accuracy .",
    "moreover , we find that the infection rate in the spreading process significantly affects the inferring results and there is an optimal infection rate for each network . the findings are confirmed in many real networks .",
    "finally , the method is extended to directed networks .",
    "we proposed a new similarity measure , which is shown to perform better than other well - known similarity measures in directed networks .",
    "we remark that many extensions can be made in this direction .",
    "for example , the inferring accuracy can be further improved if the time information of the spreading is known ( i.e. , at what time the nodes receive the virus ) .",
    "in addition , it is interesting and important to design an more efficient method for the cases where only partial information of the spreading can be obtained .",
