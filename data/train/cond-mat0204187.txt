    "bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( bi-2212 ) and bi@xmath0sr@xmath0co@xmath0o@xmath6 ( bico ) commonly have a bi@xmath0o@xmath0 block layer , in which the lattice is modulated by the excess oxygen .",
    "although these two materials have a similar crystal structure of alternating stacks of the bi@xmath0o@xmath0 layer and the cuo@xmath0 / coo@xmath0 layer , they show quite different physical properties ; bi-2212 is known as a high - temperature superconductor , while bico is known as a thermoelectric material  @xcite .",
    "high resolution transmission electron microscope studies of the bi - based superconductors ( including bi-2212 ) have clarified that they have strongly modulated structure along @xmath2-axis and that modulation periodicity is reported about 4.8@xmath2 for pb - free bi-2212  @xcite .",
    "this modulated structure disappears in pb - doped bi-2212  @xcite .",
    "bico was first thought as having a structure isomorphic to that of bi-2212 .",
    "however , it turned out to have a misfit layer structure along the @xmath2 axis , which consists of alternating stacks of the rock - salt bi@xmath0o@xmath0 layers and the hexagonal coo@xmath0 layers  @xcite .",
    "the modulation structure also exists in the pure bico although its direction is tilted by 45@xmath5 from @xmath3- and @xmath2-axes in contrast with bi-2212 .",
    "since the cuo@xmath0 and coo@xmath0 layers are responsible for electric conduction , it is interesting how the electric properties are affected by the modulation and the misfit structure . here",

    "single crystals of bi-2212 and bico was grown by a traveling solvent floating zone method .",
    "starting composition of bi-2212 and bico was bi@xmath14sr@xmath15cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 and ( bi , pb)@xmath0sr@xmath0co@xmath0o@xmath6 respectively . the growth velocity was adopted to be 0.5mm / h , and the growth atmosphere was a mixed gas flow of o@xmath0 ( 20% ) and ar ( 80% ) .",
    "structural analysis for bico was performed by using 4-axis x - ray diffractmater ( mac science mxc ) and transmission electron microscope ( jeol jem-100cx ) .",
    "pb - doped bico was found to monoclinic symmetry with lattice parameter of a=4.91@xmath16 , b=5.22@xmath16 , c=29.98@xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath1890.0@xmath19 , @xmath2092.4@xmath19 . in tem diffraction patterns",
    ", we clearly observed a rock - salt diffraction pattern from the bio layer and a hexagonal diffraction pattern from the coo@xmath0 layer as was previously reported in ref .",
    "the montgomery method was adopted to measure the in - plane resistivity of bi-2212 because they show rather small anisotropy between the @xmath3- and @xmath2-axes . on the other hand ,",
    "the resistivity of bico was measured using a standard four probe method , where the current contacts were carefully mounted on the side surface ( @xmath21- or @xmath22-surface ) so that current density should be homogeneous everywhere in the sample .",
    "the thermopower was measured using a steady - state technique from 4.2 to 300k .",
    "figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the @xmath3- and @xmath2- axis resitstivities ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) for various doping levels . the magnitudes and the slopes @xmath25/@xmath26 monotonically decrease with increasing oxygen contents @xmath27 , indicating that the carriers are actually doped with increasing @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "@xmath24 is higher than @xmath23 , where @xmath28 is roughly expressed as a sum of @xmath29 and a t - independent residual resistivity ( @xmath30 ) at high temperature .",
    "an underdoped sample shows a typical downward deviation from high temperature @xmath31-linear behavior below a characteristic temperature @xmath4 , which implies pseudogap formation . in fig . 2 ( a ) , we show the magnitudes of the deviation from @xmath31-linear extrapolation ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) for oxygen content @xmath320.23 , and 0.25 . as seen in fig .",
    "2(a ) , @xmath7 and @xmath8 deviate each other below the pseudogap temperature @xmath4 , indicating that the decrease of @xmath24 is more rapid than that of @xmath23 .",

    "the magnitude of the thermopower decreases with increasing @xmath27 , also indicating that the excess oxygen causes the carrier doping . typical negative slope at high temperature was observed in all the doping levels .",
    "in contrast with the in - plane resistivities , there is no anisotropy in the thermopower within our experimental error of 10% .",
    "these results suggest that the modulation structure along the b - axis works as an anisotropic scattering center above @xmath4 , but does not affect the pseudogap value . in principle , thermopower does not attribute to the scattering rate . in yba@xmath0cu@xmath33o@xmath34 ( ybco ) case , since the cuo chain also attributes to the electron conduction , there exists large anisotropy in the normal - state resistivity . in superconducting state ,",
    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurement reported a significant ( @xmath35 ) difference in the gap magnitude between @xmath36 and @xmath37 point  @xcite .",

    ", optical conductivity shows an upturn behavior at low frequencies for the @xmath2-axis polarization that is not present in the @xmath3-axis polarization  @xcite .",
    "this upturn behavior is very simlarly seen in the optical conductivity of zn doped ybco  @xcite .",
    "this indicates the presence of low - lying excitations along the @xmath2-axis , perhaps due to an additional scattering caused by the modulation structure .",

    "anisotropy is relatively small . on the other hand",

    "in contrast with bi-2212 , they exhibit a large anisotropy , where the @xmath2-axis thermopower is about two times larger than the @xmath3-axis thermopower around 50k . at room temperature ,",
    "the @xmath3-axis thermopower is larger than the @xmath2-axis thermopower by about 10@xmath41v / k .",
    "temperature independent thermopower at high temperature is often explained in terms of an entropy per site ( the heikes formula )  @xcite , which is in principal isotropic .",
    "thus the heikes formula is unlikely to be applicable to the thermopower of bico .",
    "the large anisotropy in the pb - doped sample would come from the misfit structure along the @xmath2-axis . on the other hand , in the case of the resistivities of the pb - free sample",
    ", anisotropy would be averaged by the modulation structure , whose direction is tilted by 45@xmath5 from the @xmath3- and @xmath2-axes . it was pointed out that the physical properties of the layered cobalt oxides resemble those of the ce - based compounds  @xcite .",
    "the thermopower of cecu@xmath0ge@xmath0 increases with increasing pressure . in the ce - based compound",
    ", pressure shrinks the lattice to increase the hybridization between the ce 4@xmath42 state and the conduction band .",
    "the large thermopower of bico would be also attributed to the increase of hybridization , which comes from chemical pressure due to the misfit structure .",
    "in conclusion , we investigated the in - plane anisotropy on the resistivity and thermopower of the bi-2212 and bi - sr - co - o .",
    "we found in bi-2212 that the modulation structure causes the residual resistivity on @xmath24 as @xmath24=@xmath23+@xmath43 .",
    "however , it does not affect the pseudogap formation and the thermopower . in the case of pure bico",
    ", the in - plane anisotropy of the resistivity is averaged by the modulation structure , whose direction is tilted by 45@xmath5 from the @xmath3- and @xmath2-axes . on the other hand ,",
