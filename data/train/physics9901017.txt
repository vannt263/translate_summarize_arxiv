    "the properties of the continuum of quantum states observed in the photoionization of an atom or the dissociation of a molecule have attracted interest since the first formulations of quantum theory . until the widespread use of lasers , the continuum was regarded as a dissipative system , to be treated by means of rate equations ( typically using the approximation of the fermi golden rule @xcite to calculate the transition rate into the continuum ) .",
    "contemporary views no longer regard continuum states as an irreversible drain of probability .",
    "an electron acted upon by a laser field of sufficiently high frequency to produce ionization does not move irreversibly away from the binding region @xcite .",
    "laser interactions with a continuum have been shown to exhibit rabi - type oscillations ( if the laser field is sufficiently strong ) @xcite and to enable nearly complete population transfer into a continuum ( i.e. photoionization or photodissociation @xcite ) or from a continuum ( i.e. photorecombination @xcite ) .",
    "both theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite work has shown that the wavefunction of an electron in a laser field may often maintain coherence during the course of photoionization , and that photodissociation can also maintain coherence .",
    "consequences of continuum coherence are to be found in the well - studied phenomena of autoionization @xcite , which is revealed as a resonance in plots of photoionization cross - sections versus frequency .",
    "such resonances display the effect of interference between two ionization channels whose destructive interference can lead to complete suppression of photoionization at a specific wavelength .",
    "one of the more interesting coherent phenomena involving the continuum is the use of a laser field to embed an autoionization resonance into an otherwise featureless photoionization continuum .",

    "this optically induced resonance can be detected by a second ( possibly weaker ) laser field which serves as a probe and induces a transition from a populated bound state into the newly structured continuum .",
    "we remark that when the continuum is composed of several channels ( derived e.g. from different asymptotic internal states of dissociation products ) the dissociation has been shown to give rise to a quantum control scheme @xcite in which the ratio between the asymptotic channels can be controlled by tuning the dissociating ( or dressing ) laser across a lics resonance .",
