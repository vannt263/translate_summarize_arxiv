    "long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have eight separate luminosity relations , where a measured photometric or spectroscopic property is correlated with the burst s luminosity ( norris , marani , & bonnell 2000 ; fenimore & ramirez - ruiz 2000 ; schaefer 2003 ; amati et al . 2002 ; ghirlanda , ghisellini , & lazzati 2004 ; schaefer 2002 ; firmani et al .",
    "physical explanations for these relations have been proposed ( schaefer 2004 ; mszros et al . 2002 ; kobayashi , ryde , & macfadyen 2002 ; schaefer 2003 ; rees & mszros 2005 ; schaefer 2002 ; thompson , mszros , & rees 2006 ; eichler & levinson 2004 ; liang , dai , & wu 2004 ; giannios & spruit 2006 ) .",
    "the relations return luminosities with varying degrees of accuracy . as the returned luminosities from each of the eight relations are largely independent",
    ", they are best combined to produce a single weighted - average luminosity with a surprisingly good accuracy .",
    "this combined luminosity along with the burst s brightness can give a luminosity distance to the grb , and then paired with a fiducial cosmology to yield a redshift of the burst . with our sample of 69 grbs with spectroscopic redshifts , we have already demonstrated that the accuracy is 26% in redshift ( schaefer 2006 ) .",
    "the scatter of our derived redshifts about the spectroscopic redshifts is a good gaussian distribution with a reduced chi - square of nearly unity , so this demonstrates that our derived error bars are realistic . with this",
    ", we have a method to derive distances to all grbs with good confidence to within the quoted error bars .",
    "nakar & piran ( 2005 ) have proposed a new test of one particular grb luminosity relation .",
    "the tested relation is the one between the grb isotropic energy in the gamma - ray band , @xmath4 , and the observed photon energy of the peak in the @xmath5 spectrum , @xmath6 , as first found by amati et al .",
    "their idea was to set up an equality between the energy based on the observed fluence and the energy derived from the luminosity relation , move all the redshift dependent terms to one side and the observables to the other side of the equation .",
    "from here , a maximum can be found on the redshift side and compared with the quantity calculated from the observables for many grbs .",
    "the nakar & piran test is then to see whether the derived quantities from the observables exceeds this maximum possible value ( at least to within the error bars ) .",
    "when applied to a sample of batse bursts , they found that @xmath725% of their samples violated this simple requirement .",
    "subsequently , band & preece ( 2005 ) found that 88% of their sample of batse bursts violated the nakar & piran test .",
    "this would be a serious blow against the validity of one of the luminosity relations .",
    "amati ( 2006 ) has strongly defended this particular luminosity relation , mainly on the grounds that the luminosity relation is highly significant , broadly applicable , and fits a well - defined calibration .",
    "ghirlanda , ghisellini , & firmani ( 2005 ) have explained the discrepancy as simply that nakar & piran used an old version of the amati relation ( based on just nine bursts ) and did not allow for the real uncertainties .",
    "li ( 2006 ) has applied a similar analysis to the @xmath0 amati relation to demonstrate that the returned redshifts for any burst is actually ambiguous with two possible values .",
    "li finds the maximum to occur at a redshift of 3.8 , such that , for example , a @xmath8 burst has identical properties as a @xmath9 burst .",
    "in addition , around the redshift of the maximum , the derived error bar should be very large .",
    "for realistic error bars , li finds that the amati relation will return redshifts with very large uncertainties for bursts with @xmath10 .    with this",
    ", we have what can be perceived as a significant challenge to the reliability , ambiguity , and utility of one of the eight luminosity relations .",
    "the obvious task is to generalize this test to all eight of the luminosity relations .",
    "indeed , band & preece have already applied the nakar & piran test to the @xmath2 relation of ghirlanda , ghisellini , & lazzati ( 2004 ) , and found only a small fraction of violators ( 1.6% ) . in this paper",
    ", we generalize the tests of nakar & piran and li to all eight grb luminosity relations .",
    "the importance of these tests is that they bear on the validity and accuracy of all the relations , and the utility of these relations is a prerequisite for getting cosmology from grbs .",
    "we will now present the same derivation as used in nakar & piran ( 2005 ) and li ( 2006 ) , but with a generalized notation that can handle all eight luminosity relations .",
    "the luminosity relations connect a measure of the burst s luminosity ( notated as @xmath11 ) with a luminosity indicator ( notated as @xmath12 ) .",
    "the luminosity , @xmath11 , can be the isotropic luminosity , @xmath13 , the isotropic energy emitted in gamma rays , @xmath14 , or the @xmath14 value corrected by the beaming factor ( @xmath15 ) from the jet , @xmath16 .",
    "the luminosity indicator , @xmath12 , can be the spectral lag @xmath17 ( norris , marani , & bonnell 2000 ) , the variability @xmath18 ( fenimore & ramires - ruiz 2000 ) , the @xmath6 from the spectrum , the minimum rise time in the light curve @xmath19 , or the number of peaks in the light curve @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , firmani et al . ( 2006 ) take a particular combination involving @xmath6 and @xmath21 ( the duration over which the brightest portion of the light curve emits 45% of the fluence ) to be a luminosity indicator , as given by @xmath22 .",
    "all of these indicators have to be corrected from their observed values to the values in the grb rest frame by multiplication by @xmath23 raised to a power @xmath24 .",
    "the relations are all simple power laws with indices @xmath25 and constants @xmath26 .",
    "the luminosity relations can be expressed as @xmath27^m.\\ ] ] the eight relations have their particular values for @xmath11 , @xmath26 , @xmath12 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 given in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath11 for each burst of known redshift can be determined from the observed brightness , @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath28 value will either be the bolometric peak flux , @xmath29 , the bolometric fluence , @xmath30 , or the beaming corrected fluence , @xmath31 , depending on the value for @xmath11 .",
    "the inverse square law of light can then be expressed as @xmath32 the luminosity distance , @xmath33 , is related to the redshift , @xmath34 , through the usual integral ; for which we have throughout this paper assumed a flat universe with @xmath35 and an unchanging cosmological constant of @xmath36 .",
    "when we are dealing with fluences and burst energies , a factor of @xmath37 is need to correct for time dilation .",
    "the corresponding values for @xmath28 and @xmath38 are presented in table 1 for each luminosity relation .",
    "we can use equations 1 and 2 to eliminate @xmath11 . with this , we can place all the redshift - dependent terms onto the left side of the equation and all the observable quantities on the right side of the equation . finally , we can multiply both sides by @xmath39 so as to make both sides dimensionless and of reasonable magnitude .",
    "thus , @xmath40 ( { \\cal a ~ i}^m / { \\cal b}).\\ ] ] we will be making frequent reference to both the left and right sides of this equation separately , so we will notate the two sides separately .",
    "this will be @xmath41 ( { \\cal a ~ i}^m / { \\cal b}),\\ ] ] @xmath42 with this , we expect @xmath43 .",
    "it is convenient to define a maximum value for @xmath44 , which we will label as @xmath45 . for two of the relations ,",
    "the @xmath44 comes to a simple maximum at some moderate redshift value , @xmath46 ( see table 1 ) . for the other relations ,",
    "the @xmath44 keeps rising as the redshift increases out past where any grb might lie . in the spirit of this test , we know that these @xmath44 values for all observed bursts must be less that the value at the maximum grb redshift . from bromm & loeb ( 2002 ) , we know that grbs can not be made at @xmath47 or so .",
    "thus , for the six relations with no @xmath46 , we take @xmath45 to be the value of @xmath48 .",
    "the values of @xmath45 are given in table 1 .",
    "so in the most general terms , the nakar & piran test is whether @xmath49 for observed grbs , while the li test is whether @xmath50 .    to extend the nakar & piran test , we have chosen to use a set of 69 grbs with spectroscopic redshifts for which all the required data have already been extracted and reduced for purposes of making a grb hubble diagram .",
    "complete details on the selection of these bursts , their redshifts , and all their observed properties are presented in schaefer ( 2006 ) .",
    "these bursts were the ones used to derive the best fit luminosity relations ( schaefer 2006 ) as expressed by equation 2 and the parameters in table 1 .",
    "the scatter of the observed @xmath51 about the value derived from the observed @xmath52 varies widely amongst the relations , with the scatter generally being larger than the error bars from measurement errors alone .",
    "schaefer ( 2006 ) has shown that this systematic scatter is not apparently dependent on redshift or luminosity , and its magnitude is consistent with arising from the expected scatter due to malmquist and gravitational lensing effects . to account for this systematic error",
    ", we add in quadrature the values listed in table 1 .",
    "the result is that the combined redshifts ( from all available luminosity indicators ) have a one - sigma scatter of 26% when compared to the spectroscopic redshifts ( see figure 9 of schaefer 2006 ) .",
    "in addition , the reduced chi - square of this comparison is close to unity , demonstrating that the derived error bars are reliable .",
    "it is this analysis which validates the use of the luminosity relations to get burst redshifts which are reliable to within the quoted error bars ( typically 26% ) .",
    "the utility of the luminosity relations is that we can go from observed quantities to the distance . in more detail",
    ", we can calibrate the relations with grbs of known redshift so as to derive @xmath26 and @xmath25 , measure @xmath12 for each burst , calculate @xmath53 , set @xmath44 as being equal to @xmath53 , then determine the luminosity distance and redshift that produces the @xmath44 .",
    "the problem that li ( 2006 ) pointed out is that this procedure is ambiguous for the @xmath0 amati relation , because there are always _ two _ distances / redshifts that produce the observed value @xmath53 .",
    "that is , there will always be a redshift below @xmath46 and a redshift above @xmath46 for which @xmath43 . to take a specific example , for the @xmath0 amati relation , a @xmath54 burst",
    "could be confused with a @xmath55 burst , and a @xmath56 burst could be confused for a @xmath57 burst ; at least in principle .",
    "more importantly , li points out that the error bars on the derived redshift will be quite large when @xmath58 , with the reason being that @xmath44 changes little with redshift .",
    "again with the @xmath0 amati relation , @xmath44 is within 10% of @xmath45 for @xmath59 . given a one - sigma uncertainty in @xmath60 of @xmath61 ( amati 2006 ) , any grb with @xmath62 will be within one - sigma of @xmath46 . as such",
    ", the test of li puts severe limits on the utility of one of the luminosity relations for purposes of deriving redshifts .",
    "amati ( 2006 ) defends his relation by pointing to the tight calibration curves over a large dynamic range of luminosities .",
    "this is indeed a strong defense if the question is about the existence and the fit parameters ( i.e. , @xmath63 and @xmath25 ) for the @xmath0 relation .",
    "this is because bursts with _ known _ redshifts will have a unique and well determined value for @xmath44 . but this does not work in the other direction , as a known value of @xmath44 ( from the observed @xmath53 ) does not produce a unique or necessarily well - determined value for the redshift .",
    "so both sides are right ; the @xmath0 relation certainly exists , while the relation fails in practice for determining the redshift if @xmath64 .",
    "we now extend the test of li to all eight luminosity relations .",
    "this can be done by calculating the values of @xmath65 from @xmath66 , as we have plotted in figure 1 .",
    "the curve that rises the fastest is for the @xmath0 amati relation , and we immediately see why it runs into trouble with the test of li .",
    "the reason is that @xmath46 is in the range of redshift where many grbs are seen , so that a horizontal line corresponding to @xmath67 intersects the curve in two places .",
    "also , the nearly flat part of the curve ( around @xmath46 ) implies that a given measured value of @xmath67 ( with the usual uncertainties ) will fit the curve over a large range of redshifts . with this",
    ", we see that a luminosity relation will have trouble with the test of li only if it has @xmath50 or if there is a near - flat portion .",
    "six of the relations have no problem with the test of li , as they are monotonically rising fast out to high redshifts .",
    "other than the @xmath0 relation , only one relation has apparent problems , the @xmath2 relation of ghirlanda , ghisellini , & lazzati ( 2004 ) . in this case ,",
    "so , for example , we might be in danger of confusing a @xmath69 burst for a @xmath70 burst .",
    "more importantly , high redshift bursts must have a large uncertainty in any derived redshift .",
    "for a one - sigma scatter in @xmath60 of @xmath71 ( ghirlanda , ghisellini , & lazzati 2004 ) , all bursts with redshift @xmath72 will be within one - sigma of each other .",
    "in general , the ambiguities in derived redshifts for the @xmath0 and @xmath2 relations can always be resolved .",
    "for example , with the @xmath2 relation , the high redshift branch will return @xmath34 values that can be rejected due to afterglow being seen at optical wavelengths ( as required to observe a jet break ) which would be shorter than the lyman limit .",
    "also , the lower possible redshift will always be much more likely than the higher possible redshift simply due to the rarity of very high luminosity events in the grb luminosity function .",
    "but the general solution is to have multiple luminosity indicators , for which the various indicators will overlap for only one solution . in all , even though there is formally an ambiguity for two of the relations , the ambiguities will always be resolved in practice .",
    "one of the uses of the luminosity indicators is in the construction of a grb hubble diagram from bursts with known redshifts .",
    "the problems noted by li are not relevant in this case , as the _ known _ redshifts allow us to derive a unique and well - determined value of @xmath44 ( for the given cosmology ) .    in summary :",
    "( a ) li s test is easily passed for six of the relations for all questions , ( b ) the redshift ambiguity will always be resolved in practice for the other two relations , ( c ) the @xmath0 and @xmath2 relations can not return accurate derived redshifts for @xmath10 and @xmath72 respectively , ( d ) all eight luminosity relations have no problems for questions ( such as the grb hubble diagram ) involving bursts of _ known _ redshifts .",
    "nakar & piran ( 2005 ) and band & preece ( 2005 ) report that a large fraction of grbs violate the idealized requirement that @xmath73 for the @xmath0 relation .",
    "ghirlanda , ghisellini , & firmani ( 2005 ) point out that these violations arise only due to the use of an old calibration of the amati relation and due to unrealistically small adopted error bars . for whatever resolution",
    ", the test of nakar & piran should be extended to all eight luminosity relations .",
    "for the 69 grbs , we calculate @xmath67 for each burst",
    ". then we count how many burst have this quantity greater than unity , and hence are violators in the nakar & piran test . for each luminosity relation ,",
    "the fraction of violators are given in the last column of table 1 .",
    "three of the relations have zero violators .",
    "three other relations each have only two bursts that are just barely in violation , where the violators are all within 0.6-sigma of the expected value of @xmath65 .",
    "thus , these six relations pass the nakar & piran test .",
    "but two relations ( the @xmath0 and @xmath2 relations ) have substantial fractions of violators , and it is no coincidence that these are the same relations that have @xmath50 .    for the two relations with the most violators , we have plotted the observed @xmath67 and the theoretical @xmath65 as a function of redshift ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "if the luminosity indicators were perfect , then all the observed points would fall along the smooth curve .",
    "the plotted error bars as well as the apparent scatter about the model curve illustrate the typical scatter that arises in each relation .",
    "violators of the nakar & piran test are those grbs that are higher than zero on this log - scale .",
    "by using a sample of bursts with spectroscopic redshifts , we can better see what is going on .",
    "in particular , we see that the most of the grbs have redshifts where @xmath74 \\approx 0 $ ] , and so the normal scatter in the relation naturally creates many violators . at @xmath46 , we expect half the bursts to be violators . and for redshifts of @xmath62 , we have @xmath65 close to unity , so somewhat less than 50% of the bursts should be violators .",
    "we see from figure 2 that the violators are simply the upper tail of a normal distribution , and hence do not significantly violate the @xmath0 relation",
    ".    for the @xmath2 relation of ghirlanda , ghisellini , & lazatti ( 2004 ) , figure 2 shows a similar situation with only five violators , all with @xmath75 deviations .",
    "the curve is near zero for the higher redshifts , the violators are all at high redshift , and the scatter about the curve is normally distributed .",
    "again , the existence of violators appears to be a simple consequence of the expected scatter from both systematic and observational errors .    in summary of our generalized nakar & piran test , we find that all eight luminosity relations satisfy the test . in particular , while some bursts have @xmath49 , this is an expected consequence of ordinary scatter about the best fit relation .",
