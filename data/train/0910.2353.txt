    "zone plate telescopes ( zpts ) have generated immense theoretical interest in the past .",
    "( ables , 1968 ; dicke , 1968 ; barrett & swindell , 1996 ; desai , norris & nemiroff , 1993 ; desai et al . 1993 ; 1998 , 2000 ) . due to the availability of technology",
    "to make finer zones using x - ray and gamma - ray opaque materials , the interest of using zone plates have increased recently . in chakrabarti",
    "et al . ( 2009 , hereafter paper i ) , we presented extensive theoretical studies and some of the results of the experiments conducted at the indian centre for space physics x - ray laboratory on zone plate telescopes .",
    "such telescopes have been used in indian payload system rt-2 aboard the russian satellite coronas - photon which was launched on 30th january , 2009 .",
    "as mentioned in paper i the zpts have an advantage over other high resolution x - ray telescopes in that they can have arbitrarily high angular resolution and that the resolution can also be independent of energy bands in a large range of energy .",
    "the only disadvantage is of course that the zpt is a two element system as opposed to the conventional coded aperture masks ( cams ) which are single element systems .    in the present paper of our series",
    "we shall present the results of the monte - carlo simulations of the nature of photon distribution on the detector planes for various combinations of zone plates and x - ray sources .",
    "the basic starting point in this paper would be paper i and references therein . here , we consider one pair to four pairs of zone plate combinations , with a point source and distributed sources .",
    "we also vary the distance of source from finite to infinite .",
    "we hope to be able to present the most comprehensive results in this subject so that interpretation of the data from coronas - photon may become easier . in our next paper ( nandi et al .",
    "2009 ) the instrumentation and early results from rt-2 payload which uses zpts would be presented .",
    "the plan of the present paper is the following : in the next section , we discuss the angular resolution of a zpt and also the variation of the nature of the reconstructed image when the source distance varies . in section 3",
    ", we will present in detail the results of our simulations in various circumstances .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we make concluding remarks .",
    "in paper - i , we discussed the theory of the zpts and how the images are reconstructed .",
    "we also discussed the situation when a pseudo - source or a dc - offset appears .",
    "presently , we discuss the resolution and source broadening when the source distance is varied and how to rectify the broadening effect .",
    "resolution of an instrument refers to its ability to distinguish two closely placed sources .",
    "it is the minimum angular separation between two sources which could be separated . for a pair of aligned zone plates ,",
    "this can be computed as follows ( see fig .",
    "1 ) :     since any point in cd is equivalent for imaging purpose.,width=480,height=144 ]    let ab and cd denote the finest zones in the first and the second zone plates ( zp1 and zp2 ) respectively .",
    "a point @xmath0 on cd can distinguish two sources as ` separate ' sources only if photons from them arrive at @xmath0 through two different zones , say through points a and b , where ab is the opaque zone of the first zone plate zp1 . however , since any point in cd would be equivalent , the location of @xmath0 could vary from @xmath1 to @xmath2 and as such , the resolution would be governed not by the angle @xmath3 , but by @xmath4 where , @xmath5 , width of the considered zone , @xmath6 being the inner radius and @xmath7 is the zone number under consideration .",
    "when we consider inner zones , the situation is worsened , as the width of the zone becomes larger .    in resolving the sources , and indeed , even to be able to identify a single source , the size of the detector pixel @xmath8 also plays a major role .",
    "for instance , if @xmath9 for all @xmath7 , in the computation of the resolution , @xmath10 has to be replaced by @xmath8 .",
    "however , if the source is so off - axis that two successive moir fringes fall on the same detector pixel , then that source would not be ` visible ' by the telescope . to show this ,",
    "let us recall from paper i that the fringe separation @xmath11 in a zone plate is given by @xmath12 , where , @xmath13 is the distance of the projection of the center of zp1 on zp2 as measured from the center of zp2 and is given by @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the separation between zone plates , and @xmath16 being the offset angle .",
    "the largest possible offset angle is obtained by equating @xmath17 with the pixel size @xmath18 of the detector .",
    "this gives @xmath19 .",
    "for our set up in rt-2/czt payload ( nandi et al . , 2009 ) , @xmath20 cm , @xmath21 cm for czt detector and @xmath22 cm .",
    "this gives @xmath23 arcmin .",
    "thus the field of view of the zpt with a czt detector would be at the most @xmath24arc min .",
    "if the source casts fringes along the diagonal of the zone plate , @xmath18 would be replaced by @xmath25 cm and the value of @xmath26 would be @xmath27 arc min .",
    "so far , we discussed the resolution when the object is placed at a large distance . when the source is close by , the image is distorted since various points of a single transparent zone is located at various incident angles due to divergence of the beam . in fig .",
    "2 we show that photons from a source @xmath28 are incident to form a moir fringe at various angles ( say , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) depending on the location of the fringe . when the inverse transformation is made to reconstruct the source , it would assume the direction of the source as the directions of the incident rays in different points of the fringe .",
    "thus the source is not exactly reproduced and generally the source is broadened .",
    "the reconstructed source is contained in the same solid angle as that produced by the moir pattern on the actual source ( i.e. , that obtained by the largest angular size @xmath31 ) .",
    "when the source distance is increased , this solid angle becomes zero and a point source is reproduced as a point ( if permissible by the detector pixel ) . in case",
    "the moir pattern is not circular , but has some other shape ( e.g. , like a gibbous moon , see fig . 9 below ) , the sum @xmath31 will be direction dependent and hence the reconstructed image of a point source would also be like a miniature version of the moir pattern itself .",
    "the broadening of the reconstructed image clearly affects the resolution by worsening it . to see this ,",
    "let us assume that the width of the outermost transparent zone is @xmath10 as before , and the zone plates are separated by a distance @xmath15 .",
    "the angular resolution is @xmath32 ( eq .",
    "1 ) . this becomes meaningful only if the reconstructed source has an angular size less than @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 be the average distance of the sources at an angular distance of @xmath32 ( fig",
    ". 1 ) and the outer radius of the front zone plate be @xmath34 , then from fig .",
    "2 , the angular size of the moir pattern as seen by an average source point @xmath35",
    "(= @xmath31 ) is given by @xmath36 . in order",
    "that broadened images are also resolved , we must have @xmath37 i.e. , @xmath38 it is to be noted that the result is independent of the size of the zone plate since the result only depends on the number of zones and neither on @xmath6 nor on @xmath34 . as an example , for zone plates with number of zones , @xmath39 and separated by @xmath40  cm , the distance @xmath33 must be at least @xmath41  cm in order that the resolution remains at least as good as the point source .",
    "closer sources will have a resolution inferior to this .",
    "a simpler way to improve the resolution when the source is at a finite distance would be to reconstruct the telescope in such a way that both the zone plates subtend equal solid angle as seen from the source .",
    "this can be easily achieved by changing the radii of the zones of the second zone plate in such a way that the radius of the original inner ring @xmath42 is replaced by @xmath43 where , @xmath15 is the distance between the zone plates and @xmath33 is the distance of zp2 from the source .",
    "one can recompute the resolution of such a zpt and easily show that the resolution would be the same as the original zone plate telescope having the source at infinity .",
    "so far , we presented some basic theoretical results . in",
    "what follows , we present results of simulations of diverse kinds in order to show that the theoretical considerations hold true .",
    "we will generally consider zone plates having @xmath44 zones with the innermost radius @xmath20  cm .",
    "however , the distance @xmath15 may vary .",
    "this will be mentioned as and when necessary . in paper",
    "i , it was discussed that one requires four pairs of zone plates in a complete x - ray imaging telescope in order that neither the dc - offset , nor the pseudo - source ( alias ) appears in the reconstructed image .",
    "furthermore , one also has very less noise in the reconstructed image , in general . in this subsection",
    ", we will discuss the results of simulations and discuss under what condition this holds true .      in this section ,",
    "we consider all the four pairs placed in the following way :    1st quadrant elements : @xmath45 & @xmath45 ( positive and negative respectively ) + 2nd quadrant elements : @xmath45 & @xmath46 ( positive and negative respectively ) + 3rd quadrant elements : @xmath45 & @xmath46 ( both positive ) + 4th quadrant elements : @xmath45 & @xmath45 ( both positive )    here , by @xmath47 type , we mean the plate having @xmath7th zone radius @xmath48 .",
    "first , we carry out the simulations with the source at infinity .",
    "the zone plate spacing in each case is taken to be @xmath49 cm .",
    "the source is placed at an angular distance of @xmath50 arcsec from the optical axis and at a zenith angle of @xmath51 deg measured from the positive x - axis .",
    "the number of photons infalling on each of the front zone plates ( zp1s ) is @xmath52 .",
    "the fringes obtained in each of the pairs is given in fig .",
    "the source obtained by reconstruction is shown in fig .",
    "3b . note that neither the dc offset , nor the pseudo - source appears in the reconstructed image .",
    "arcsec along each side of the squared base .",
    "neither the pseudo - source nor the dc offset are seen in the reconstructed image.,title=\"fig:\",width=240,height=240 ]   arcsec along each side of the squared base .",
    "neither the pseudo - source nor the dc offset are seen in the reconstructed image.,title=\"fig:\",width=220,height=220 ]    if the source is brought to a finite distance , however , the dc off - set is always canceled but the pseudo - source can not be canceled even if four pairs are used .",
    "this is because the angles subtended by the source at different pairs become different . to demonstrate this in figs .",
    "4(a - b ) we show the reconstructed images of the source kept at @xmath53 arcsec , @xmath54 in the source plane and at ( a ) @xmath55 cm and ( b ) @xmath56 cm distance from zp1 respectively . in fig .",
    "4a we see that the pseudo - source is present albeit very weak . in fig .",
    "4b , when the source is closer by , the pseudo - source is very strong as the positive and negative effects from the complimentary pairs did not cancel at all . only when @xmath57 cm , the pseudo - source becomes weak enough to be negligible when @xmath58 cm .",

    "the field of view is @xmath59 . in ( a )",
    "the pseudo - source is weaker , but in ( b ) it is strong .",

    "this non - cancellation of the pseudo - source is due to very close distance of the source from the zone plates.,title=\"fig:\",width=192,height=192 ]      in the last section , we used four pairs of zone plates . from the theoretical discussion it is clear that if we use two pairs of zone plates , one of which gives a cosine transform and other gives a sine transform ,",
    "the pseudo - source will be removed though the dc - offset will remain . in an experiment",
    ", one has to obtain the images simultaneously and superpose the arrays and carry out the inverse fourier transformation in order to reconstruct the image .",
    "arcsec on each side .",
    "the pseudo - source is totally absent.,title=\"fig:\",width=240,height=240 ]   arcsec on each side .",
    "the pseudo - source is totally absent.,title=\"fig:\",width=206,height=206 ]    to form the cosine pattern let us take two zone plates which are positive and the radii of both the plates are given by @xmath60 , where , as before , @xmath61 is the radius of the @xmath7-th ring and @xmath6 is central zone radius .",
    "of course , both plates having @xmath62 or @xmath63 could also be used . to form a sine pattern ,",
    "let us take two zone plates which are both positive , and the radius of @xmath7th zone of one plate is @xmath64 and the other plate is given by , @xmath65 .",
    "for the second zone plate , one could also use @xmath63 .    in fig .",
    "5a we show the fringe patterns formed by two pairs of zone plates when a point source is placed at infinity . in the simulation , the separation between the zone plates is taken to be @xmath66 cm . the source location in its plane",
    "has the coordinates of @xmath67 arcsec and @xmath68 degree .",
    "the number of photons on each of the front zone plates is taken to be @xmath52 .",
    "the reconstructed three dimensional source is presented in fig .",
    "we observe that the dc - offset is still present but the pseudo - source is removed successfully .    when the source is brought nearer to the zone plate telescope , then , as in the case with four pairs of zone plates (  3.1.1 ) , the pseudo - source reappears and becomes prominent as the distance is reduced .",
    "this is because the angles subtended by the source with the optical axis of the individual pairs are different . in figs .",
    "6(a - b ) , we present the reconstructed images . the zone plate separation is @xmath49 cm and the source has the coordinate @xmath53 arcsec and @xmath69 deg . in fig .",

    "the resolution is , however , moderate .",
    "the quality of the image depends on the distance of the source from zp1 , the first zone plate .",
    "here we systematically show how the resolution varies with telescope parameters .",
    "for clarity of the image , we use four pairs of zone plates in each of these simulations .      from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we note that for zone plates with a spacing of @xmath74 cm between them , the resolution should be @xmath75 arcsec . in fig .",
    "7(a - b ) , we present the reconstructed images of a pair of sources which were placed at an angular distance of ( a ) @xmath76 arcsec and ( b ) @xmath75 arcsec ( limiting case ) .",
    "each side of the square is @xmath66 arcmin in length .",
    "arcsec and ( b ) @xmath75 arcsec respectively are reconstructed from the fringe patterns .",
    "the zone plate separation is @xmath74 cm . in each figure , the base is @xmath66 arcmin on each side.,title=\"fig:\",height=144 ]   arcsec and ( b ) @xmath75 arcsec respectively are reconstructed from the fringe patterns .",
    "the zone plate separation is @xmath74 cm . in each figure , the base is @xmath66 arcmin on each side.,title=\"fig:\",height=144 ]    similarly , with separations of @xmath66 cm and @xmath49 cm respectively , we get the angular resolutions to be @xmath76 and @xmath77 arcsec respectively as predicted by the theoretical estimate .    from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we see that the resolution is directly proportional to the inner radius @xmath6 of the zone plate .",
    "this is because the radius of the @xmath7th zone is proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "in order to show this , we take one of the cases we simulated above . with @xmath40 cm and @xmath20 cm , @xmath78 arcsec .",

    ", sources are not separated but in ( b ) , they are just separated , as expected.,title=\"fig:\",height=144 ]      in  2.2 , we discussed how the reconstructed image of a point source is broadened due to its finite distance from the zone plate telescope . to show this effect , we carry out the following simulation with two sources .",
    "one is placed at @xmath83 arcsec ( angular distance from the zpt axis ) and @xmath84 deg ( angle measured counter - clockwise from the x - axis ) and the other is placed at @xmath85 arcsec and @xmath86 deg .",
    "the sources are placed at a distance of @xmath87 cm from the front zone plate ( zp1 ) as in the experimental results presented in paper i. the zone plate separation is taken to be @xmath88 cm . in fig .",
    "9a , we show the fringe pattern and in fig .",
    "9b , we show the reconstructed image ( @xmath89 arcsec on each side ) .",
    "it is clear that location wise , the sources have been placed properly , although they look ` similar ' to the moir fringe patterns , which have special shapes due to off - axisness of the sources . in the simulations ,",
    "the number of photons impinging from these two sources are taken to be @xmath52 and @xmath90 respectively , causing one pattern to be slightly brighter than the other . the image size is @xmath91 arcsec .",
    "this is somewhat higher than the expected value of @xmath92 arcsec due to the fact that there is a further spreading due to finite size of the cmos detector pixel , each of which is @xmath93 micron .",

    "3 ) . the reason being that the reconstructed image of a point source placed at a finite distance acquires a finite angular size . with increasing @xmath15 , the zone plate separation , the inter - source distance in the reconstructed image increases .",
    "this causes a better resolution for the sources placed at infinity as there is no effect of broadening .",
    "however , for the sources at a finite distance , the broadening increases further with the zone plate separation ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "so sources may even overlap for sufficient broadening and resolution may worsen with an increment of @xmath15 . as an example , we show in fig .",

    "image is blurred.,width=192,height=192 ]      in  2 we have pointed out that for obtaining high resolution in case the sources at a finite distance the angular size of the zone plates as subtended at the source must be the same . in figs .",
    "12(a - b ) we show the results presented in figs . 9b and 10b using a modified zone plate telescope where such a consideration has been implemented .",
    "we clearly see that the images have becomes sharp , as though the source is at infinity .",
    "one of the advantages of carrying out numerical simulations is that one can vary the source parameters at will . in a zone plate with @xmath44 zones",
    ", we have @xmath98 transparent zones . in order to find how many photons are needed to reconstruct the image uniquely , we note that to pinpoint the centre of the plate , we need at least three photons to pass through a single zone",
    ". the rest of the @xmath99 zones may have one photon each .",
    "so , on an average if @xmath100 photons enter through the plate , then the imaging could be done with all the zone plane information taken into account . of course , lower number of photons will skip a few transparent zones and the image would be noisy .",
    "note that our argument does not depend on the overall area of the zone plate , but only depends on the total number of zones .",
    "so with a larger zone plate having the same number of zones will detect fainter sources .    in figs .",

    "in this paper , we presented results of various numerical simulations obtained by varying the source , the zone plate telescope parameters and the detector parameters .",
    "we considered both two - pair and four - pair configurations which enabled us to remove the pseudo - source and both the pseudo - source and dc - offset respectively .",
    "we pointed out that the pseudo - source can not be totally removed if the source itself is at a finite distance .",
    "this is due to the fact that at a finite distance , different pair is hit by photons from the source at various angles and the contributions to the pseudo - source do not cancel out .",
    "we showed that the resolution of the instrument is worsened when the source is placed at a finite distance .",
    "however , we showed that if the telescope is modified in a way that both the plates subtend equal angles at the source , the high resolution is recovered .",
    "of course , a practical difficulty of such a method is that the second zone plate has to be modified dynamically as the source distance is varied , though , for instance for medical purposes , one could keep the source at a fixed distance always and thus a fixed sized zp2 would suffice .",
    "alternatively , one could convolve the distorted fringes obtained due to sources at a finite distance by theoretical moir pattern obtained for the source at infinite distance before deconvolving the pixel information .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present paper and will be dealt with elsewhere .",
    "we studied the cases with both cmos and czt detectors and showed that the setup with czt detectors will have very limited field of view in order to even reconstruct a single source .",
    "this is because of the large pixel size . with a cmos detector we simulated how a zone plate telescope would view the center of the galaxy .",
    "when there are multiple sources of varying intensity , we showed that one could first obtain a general image and then improve upon it by subtracting the fringes from the strongest ones .",
    "the zone plate telescopes have very high potential for future space astronomy , especially since it will have higher resolutions over a large range of energy .",
    "they may also be used for medical science since the sources at finite distances can also be resolved well if modified zpts are used .",
    "recently zpts have been used in rt-2/czt payload aboard russian satellite coronas - photon for the first time .",
    "the satellite has been recently launched and the results are expected in near future , especially when the sun becomes active .",
    "the results of the zone plate imagers will be discussed elsewhere ( nandi et al . 2009 ) .",
