    "<S> this manuscript contains a summary of the latest physics results from phobos , as reported at quark matter 2006 . </S>",
    "<S> highlights include the first measurement from phobos of dynamical elliptic flow fluctuations as well as an explanation of their possible origin , two - particle correlations , identified particle ratios , identified particle spectra and the latest results in global charged particle production .    over the last year </S>",
    "<S> , phobos @xcite has continued to analyze the large dataset obtained from the first five runs ( 2000 - 2005 ) of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory . to a large extent , one of the primary goals of phobos to obtain a broad survey of the global properites of charged particle production is nearing completion . </S>",
    "<S> we report two new results in this area , the first for the lowest energy cu+cu collisions , @xmath0 = 22.4 gev , and the second for the peripheral yields of midrapidity charged particle emission in au+au . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the new data has followed the striking scaling rules reported in the past by phobos @xcite , in particular the energy - independence of particle production when viewed in the rest - frame of one of the colliding nuclei @xcite and the factorization of the energy and centrality dependence of midrapidity charged particle yields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also report final results for identified hadron transverse momentum spectra down to very low @xmath1 in au+au collisions at @xmath0 = 62.4 gev as well as new results for antiparticle to particle ratios in cu+cu collisions @xcite . the measurement of both elliptic and directed flow of charged particles over a uniquely large range in pseudorapidity ( @xmath2 ) </S>",
    "<S> has been an area of active analysis in phobos from the very first au+au collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the large elliptic flow signals ( @xmath3 ) measured near midrapidity at full rhic energies , which are in agreement with hydrodynamical model calculations of a relativistic hydrodynamic fluid , have provided strong credence for our current view that we are producing a strongly interacting state of matter that reaches equilibration early in the collision process . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between cu+cu and au+au of @xmath4 and mid - rapidity @xmath5 @xcite further strengthens our understanding of the phobos result reported at quark matter 2005 @xcite : the @xmath3 results for both systems can be consistently unified when scaled by the `` participant eccentricity '' , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is defined event - by - event as the initial overlap eccentricity measured in the rotated `` participant '' frame where that eccentricity is maximized . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the importance of the initial event - by - event interaction points of the participant nucleons as defined by @xmath6 , comes into clear focus when the fluctuations of this quantity are calculated and compared to the newly measured @xmath3 dynamical fluctuations in au+au @xcite . on the two particle correlations front </S>",
    "<S> , we present new data showing correlations between particles in p+p and cu+cu data at @xmath0 = 200 gev over a uniquely large region of @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also present the first physics results of a study of the centrality dependence of the short - range pseudorapidity correlations as measured by the effective cluster size , @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> studies of cluster production indicate that the isotropic cluster model produces a cluster width in pseudorapidity that is larger than found in the resonance cascade model . </S>",
    "<S> phobos also reported on the latest results of two ongoing studies of multiplicity fluctuations in au+au collisions , in particular the search for enhanced @xmath11 fluctuations and the foward - backward multiplicity fluctuations in the context of two models of cluster production @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the current upper limit for the fraction of events with large deviations in the @xmath11 distribution of 200 gev au+au collisions is @xmath12 . in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we will give a brief overview of the future direction of the phobos research program .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the primary motivations of colliding cu+cu and au+au nuclei at rhic was to enable a detailed study of the effect of system size on all measurable physics observables . </S>",
    "<S> the study of elliptic flow , with its sensitivity to the collectivity of the produced matter at very early times of the collision , is a physics measurement of particular interest . </S>",
    "<S> the result of this analysis and comparison for @xmath0 = 200 gev is shown in for the phobos hit - based and track - based elliptic flow analysis , as a function of centrality defined by the number of participants , @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> two important features are immediately evident . </S>",
    "<S> first , the magnitude of flow in the smaller cu+cu system is large and qualitatively follows a similar trend with centrality as seen in the larger au+au system . </S>",
    "<S> second , even for the most central collisions in cu+cu , the magnitude of @xmath3 is substantial , and exceeds that seen in central au+au .    in the most intuitive picture , </S>",
    "<S> our understanding of elliptic flow is that the magnitude of the final azimuthal angular distribution of produced particles relative to the reaction plane is a consequence primarily of the initial overlap eccentricity of the colliding nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> if this picture is correct , the elliptic flow results for both cu+cu and au+au should be compatible if each is scaled by the proper eccentricity . </S>",
    "<S> we have proposed that the most relevant eccentricity is not the one calculated relative to the initial impact parameter vector , which we will call the ` standard ' calculation @xmath14 , but instead the eccentricity calculated event - by - event after rotating into the frame of reference that maximizes the eccentricity defined by the participant nucleon interaction points , @xmath15 @xcite . the difference between these calculations is shown in , and deviations are clearly evident for smaller number of participants in au+au and all centralities of cu+cu collisions , a result that illustrates the importance of finite - number fluctuations of the participant interaction points . </S>",
    "<S> this result is robust to the details of the glauber monte carlo simulation , as indicated by the bands which show the 90% c.l . </S>",
    "<S> systematic errors . </S>",
    "<S> when the @xmath3 data of is scaled by @xmath15 , the two very different systems are unified on a single curve as shown in the right - hand side of .    , at midrapidity as a function of centrality ( @xmath13 ) for cu+cu and au+au collisions at @xmath0 = 200 gev . </S>",

    "<S> right : the measured midrapidity @xmath3 divided by the participant eccentricity . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2_v2-epart],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the unification of the elliptic flow results in cu+cu and au+au collisions when scaled by the participant eccentricity holds not only for the average value of @xmath3 at midrapidity , but also as a function of transverse momentum and pseudorapidity . </S>",
    "<S> this new result is shown in , where for the same number of participants in both systems we find a consistent result out to 3.5 gev / c in @xmath1 and across @xmath16 units of @xmath17 .    . </S>",
    "<S> results are shown for @xmath18 versus @xmath1 ( left ) and @xmath17 ( right ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig:3_v2_pt - eta],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the apparent relevance of the participant eccentricity model in unifying the average elliptic flow results for cu+cu and au+au collisions leads naturally to consideration of the dynamical fluctuations of both the participant eccentricy itself as well as in the elliptic flow signal from data . </S>",
    "<S> simulations of the expected dynamical fluctuations in participant eccentricity as a function of @xmath13 were performed using the phobos monte carlo glauber based participant eccentricity model , and they predict large dynamical fluctuations , @xmath19 of the order of 0.4 in au+au collisions at @xmath20 gev . </S>",
    "<S> there are several different approaches one could develop to measure dynamical elliptic flow fluctuations , and phobos has recently created a new method that is based on a direct measure of @xmath3 on an event - by - event basis using a maximum likelihood fit that utilizes the unique large pseudorapidity coverage of the phobos detector @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of this approach lies in the fact that this analysis removes the effects of statistical fluctuations and multiplicity dependence by applying a detailed model of the detector response that enables both a measurement of the average @xmath3 on an event - by - event basis as well as a measure of the dynamical fluctuations in @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results for both the average @xmath21 and the measured dynamical fluctuations , which we quantify using the ratio @xmath22 , obtained in this new analysis are given in for au+au collisions at @xmath0 = 200 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the left - hand side of shows the results for the average midrapidity elliptic flow obtained from the event - by - event analysis together with the results from both the hit - based and track - based analyses . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars represent statistical errors and the shaded bands the 90% c.l . </S>",
    "<S> systematic uncertainities . </S>",
    "<S> confidence that all three measurements are determining the average elliptic flow is increased through the observation that they agree within the systematic errors . </S>",
    "<S> the right - hand side of presents the new phobos results for @xmath3 dynamical fluctuations together with the result obtained for fluctuations in the participant eccentricity . </S>",
    "<S> systematics on the experimental measurement are improved by quantifying the result as a ratio of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe large dynamical fluctuations in elliptic flow with a magnitude in remarkable agreement with calculations of participant eccentricity fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this result suggests that the initial state equilibrates very rapidly with a collision eccentricity largely defined by each collision event s particular distribution of participant nucleon interaction points , and this detailed `` snapshot '' of the two nuclei s overlap region is propagated by the subsequent hydrodynamic evolution of the produced matter .     </S>",

    "<S> phobos has also made great progress in studying two - particle correlations between charged particles . </S>",
    "<S> we have recently published results on forward - backward multiplicity correlations in non - overlapping bins of pseudorapidity for @xmath0 = 200 gev au+au collisions @xcite . from this analysis we found that particles in au+au collisions are not produced independently , but instead appear to be produced in clusters . in particular , we found significant short - range correlations at all centralities , both as a function of @xmath17 and as a function of increasing pseudorapidity bin , @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> here we report a completely new two - particle correlation analysis that fully utilizes the extensive coverage in pseudorapidity ( @xmath25 ) and azimuthal angle ( @xmath26 ) afforded by the phobos octagon detector and its corresponding ability to measure essentially the full bulk of charged particle emission down to very low momentum . at this point in time , we report the preliminary results of this measurement in both p+p and cu+cu collisions at @xmath0 = 200 gev , where we emphasize that no @xmath1 cut on any particle is imposed . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation is calculated in the following way : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the same - event two particle correlation between all charged particles , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the uncorrelated background . </S>",
    "<S> an example of the results of this analysis for central cu+cu collisions is shown in the left - hand side of . </S>",
    "<S> one can already observe the @xmath23 correlations resulting from elliptic flow , something not present in the corresponding p+p data . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by the interesting results found in the forward - backward correlations analysis , we initially have focused on studying the short - range correlations in pseudorapidity . to accomplish this </S>",
    "<S> , we project onto @xmath24 to obtain one - dimensional correlations in @xmath24 , to which we perform fits in order to extract the parameter @xmath10 , the effective cluster size . </S>",
    "<S> this result is presented in the right - hand side of . </S>",
    "<S> the results clearly show that on average , even in heavy - ion collisions such as cu+cu , particles tend to be produced in clusters with a size of @xmath31 , which is surprisingly similar to that seen in elementary p+p collisions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there is a nontrivial dependence of @xmath10 on centrality , such that the value is larger than seen in p+p collisions for peripheral cu+cu collisions and decreases with centrality to a value below that found in p+p for central collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the observed variation of @xmath10 with centrality is not seen in hijing , and although the centrality dependence is qualitatively reproduced by ampt , the magnitude is still below that seen in the data . for more details </S>",

    "<S> the unique coverage of phobos at very low @xmath1 is evident , and the results of a blastwave fit to the higher @xmath1 data , measured using both the spectrometer and time - of - flight detector , is found to be consistent with the combined yields of pions , kaons and protons at low @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the right - hand side of shows new results on antiparticle to particle ratios as a function of centrality measured in 62.4 and 200 gev cu+cu @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the phobos measurement of antiparticle to particle ratios is unique in that due to the two identical spectrometer arms located on opposite sides of a dipole magnet we can , by simply reversing the magnetic field systematically during data taking , extract four independent measurements of identified particle ratios where all effects of acceptance and efficiency cancel out in the final ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the energy dependence of the proton and kaon particle ratios between @xmath0 = 62.4 and 200 gev is clearly evident in , and we find in all cases that the ratios are only weakly dependent , if at all , on centrality .     </S>",
