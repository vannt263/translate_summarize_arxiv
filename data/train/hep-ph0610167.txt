    "the standard model ( sm ) of the strong and electroweak ( ew ) interactions has met with extraordinary success ; it has been already tested at the level of quantum corrections @xcite .",
    "these corrections give some hints about the nature of the higgs sector , pointing towards the existence of a relatively light higgs boson , with a mass of the order of the ew scale , @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "however , it is widely believed that the sm can not be the final theory of particle physics , in particular because the higgs sector suffers from naturalness problems , and we do not really have a clear understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "these problems in the higgs sector can be stated as our present inability to find a satisfactory answer to some questions regarding its structure , which can be stated as follows :    1 .",
    "what fixes the size ( and sign ) of the _ dimensionful parameter _ @xmath19",
    "that appears in the higgs potential ? .",
    "this parameter determines the scale of ewsb in the sm ; in principle it could be as high as the planck mass , however , it needs to be fixed to much lower values .",
    "2 .   what is the nature of the quartic higgs coupling @xmath20 ? .",
    "this parameter is not associated with a known symmetry , and we expect all interactions in nature to be associated somehow with gauge forces , as these are the ones we understand better @xcite .",
    "an improvement on our understanding of ewsb is provided by the supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the sm @xcite , where loop corrections to the tree - level parameter @xmath19 are under control , thus making the higgs sector more natural .",
    "the quartic higgs couplings is nicely related with gauge couplings through relations of the form : @xmath21 . in the susy alternative it is even possible to ( indirectly ) explain the sign of @xmath19 as a result loop effects and the breaking of the symmetry between bosons and fermions .",
    "further progress to understand the sm structure is achieved in grand unified theories ( gut ) , where the strong and electroweak gauge interactions are unified at a high - energy scale ( @xmath22 ) @xcite . however , certain consequences of the gut idea seem to indicate that this unification , by itself , may be too drastic ( within the minimal su(5 ) gut model one actually gets inexact unification , too large proton decay , doublet - triplet problem , incorrect fermion mass relations , etc . ) , and some additional theoretical tool is needed to overcome these difficulties . again , susy offers an amelioration of these problems .",
    "when susy is combined with the gut program , one gets a more precise gauge coupling unification and some aspects of proton decay and fermion masses are under better control @xcite .    in order to verify the realization of susy - gut in nature",
    ", it will be necessary to observe plenty of new phenomena such as superpartners , proton decay or rare decay modes .    as nice as these ideas",
    "may appear , it seems worthwhile to consider other approaches for physics beyond the sm .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that additional progress towards understanding the sm origin , can be achieved by postulating the existence of extra dimensions .",
    "these theories have received much attention , mainly because of the possibility they offer to address the problems of the sm from a new geometrical perspective . these range from a new approach to the hierarchy problem @xcite up to a possible explanation of flavor hierarchies in terms of field localization along the extra dimensions @xcite . models with extra dimensions",
    "have been applied to neutrino physics @xcite , higgs phenomenology @xcite , among many others . in the particular gut context",
    ", it has been shown that it is possible to find viable solutions to the doublet - triplet problem @xcite .",
    "more recently , new methods in strong interactions have also been used as an attempt to revive the old models ( tc , etc , topcolor , etc ) @xcite .",
    "other ideas have motivated new types of models as well ( little higgs @xcite , ads / cft composite higgs models @xcite , etc ) .",
    "in this paper we are interested in exploring further an alternative unification scenario , of weakly - interacting type , that could offer direct understanding of the higgs sector too and was first discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "namely , we shall explore the consequences of a scenario where the electroweak @xmath23 gauge interactions are unified with the higgs self - interactions at an intermediate scale @xmath2 . here , we explore further this idea within the context of the thdm , which allows us to predict the higgs spectrum of this model .",
    "the dependence of our results on the choice for the normalization for the hypercharge is also discussed , as well as possible test of this ew - higgs unification idea at future colliders , such as ilc .",
    "besides predicting the higgs spectrum , namely the masses for the neutral cp - even states ( @xmath24 ) , the neutral cp - odd state ( @xmath25 ) and the charged higgs ( @xmath26 ) , we also discuss the higgs couplings to gauge bosons and fermions . as we mentioned in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", it is relevant to compare our approach with the so called gauge - higgs unification program , as they share some similarities .",
    "we think that our approach is more model independent , as we first explore the consequences of a parametric unification , without really choosing a definite model at higher energies .",
    "in fact , at higher energies both the susy models as well as the framework of extra dimensions could work as ultraviolet completion of our approach .",
    "the susy models could work because they allow to relate the scalar quartic couplings to the gauge couplings , thanks to the d - terms @xcite . on the other hand , within the extra - dimensions",
    "it is also possible to obtain similar relations , when the higgs fields are identified as the extra - dimensional components of gauge fields @xcite .",
    "actually , we feel that the work of ref.@xcite has a similar spirit to ours , in their case they look for gauge unification of the higgs self - couplings that appear in the superpotential of the nmssm , and then they justify their work with a concrete model in 7d .",
    "however , in the present work , we do not discuss further the unification of the ew - higgs couplings with the strong constant , which can be realized within the context of extra - dimensional gauge - higgs unified theories .     in the context of the thdm with @xmath11 , in the frame of scenario i , taking @xmath10 and @xmath27 gev .",

    "in the ew - higgs unified scenario , one assumes that there exists a scale where the gauge couplings constants @xmath3 , associated with the gauge symmetry @xmath31 , are unified , and that at this scale they also get unified with the sm higgs self coupling @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath32 at @xmath2 .",
    "the precise relation between @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( the sm hypercharge coupling ) involves a normalization factor @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath35 , which depends on the unification model .",
    "the standard normalization gives @xmath11 , which is associated with minimal models such as @xmath36 .",
    "however , in the context of string theory it is possible to have such standard normalization without even having a unification group . for other unification groups that involve additional @xmath37 factors",
    ", one would have exotic normalizations too , and similarly for the case of gut models in extra - dimensions . in",
    "what follows we shall present results for the cases : @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which indeed arise in string - inspired models @xcite . note that these values fall in the range @xmath40 and",
    "so they can illustrate what happens when one chooses a value below or above the standard normalization .",
    "the form of the unification condition will depend on the particular realization of this scenario , which could be as generic as possible .",
    "however , in order to be able to make predictions for the higgs boson mass , we shall consider two specific realizations .",

    "motivated by specific models , such as susy itself , as well as an argument based on the power counting of the beta coefficients in the rge for scalar couplings , _",
    "i.e. _ , the fact that @xmath43 goes as @xmath44 , we shall also define scenario ii , through the quadratic unification condition : @xmath45 .",
    "the expressions for the sm renormalization group equations at the two - loop level can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in practice",
    ", one determines first the scale @xmath2 at which @xmath46 and @xmath33 are unified , then one fixes the quartic higgs coupling @xmath20 by imposing the unification condition and finally , by evolving the quartic higgs coupling down to the ew scale , we are able to predict the higgs boson mass . for the numerical calculations , discussed in ref.@xcite , we employed the full two - loop sm renormalization group equations involving the gauge coupling constants @xmath47 , the higgs self - coupling @xmath20 , the top - quark yukawa coupling @xmath48 , and the parameter @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we also take the values for the coupling constants as reported in the review of particle properties @xcite , while for the top quark mass we take the value recently reported in  @xcite .",
    "now , let us summarize our previous results with the full numerical analysis .",
    "for @xmath11 we find that @xmath49 gev and by taking @xmath10 , results for the higgs boson mass are given as a function of the parameter @xmath42 over a range @xmath50 , which covers three orders of magnitude ( we stress here that the expected natural value for @xmath42 is 1 ) . for such a range of @xmath42 ,",
    "the higgs boson mass takes the values : @xmath51 gev for scenario i , while for @xmath52 we obtain a prediction for the higgs boson mass : @xmath53 gev , for a top quark mass of @xmath54 gev @xcite , respectively . on the other hand , for scenario",
    "ii , we find that the higgs boson mass can take the values : @xmath55 gev , while for @xmath52 we obtain : @xmath56 gev",
    ".    then , when we compare our results with the higgs boson mass obtained from ew precision measurements , which imply @xmath57 gev , we notice that in order to get compatibility with such value , our model seems to prefer high values of @xmath42 . for instance , by taking the lowest value that we consider here for the top mass , @xmath58 gev , and fixing @xmath59 , we obtain the minimum value for the higgs boson mass equal to @xmath60 gev in scenario i , while scenario ii implies a minimal value that is slightly lower , @xmath61 gev .    for @xmath16",

    "( @xmath64 ) gev for scenario i ( ii ) .    on the other hand , for @xmath17 we find that @xmath65 gev , which is lower than that of the previous cases , and has an even larger mass gap between @xmath2 and a possible @xmath22 . in this case and by taking @xmath10",
    "we also find values slightly higher for the higgs boson mass , for instance , for @xmath52 , one gets @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) gev for scenario i ( ii ) .",
    "at this point , rather than continuing discussions on the precise higgs boson mass , we would like to emphasize that our approach based on the ew - higgs unification idea is very successful in giving a higgs boson mass that has indeed the correct order of magnitude , and that once measured at the lhc we will be able to fix the parameter @xmath42 and find connections with other approaches for physics beyond the sm , such as the one to be discussed next .    in fact , for the higgs boson mass range that is predicted in our approach , it turns out that the higgs will decay predominantly into the mode @xmath68 , which may provide us with good chances to measure the higgs boson mass within a precision of @xmath69 @xcite , thus making it possible to bound @xmath42 to within a few percent level .",
