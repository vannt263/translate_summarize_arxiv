    "this is the highest reported magnetic moment among all iron pnictide and iron chalcogenide superconductors .",
    "the existence of the above phases within the superconducting state has generated intense debate about the interplay between these seemingly competing phases , and about the origin of superconducting pairing leading to high temperature superconductivity in this unusual environment.@xcite    the presence of phase separation between superconducting regions and the bafm has been confirmed using a variety of experiments including spectroscopy,@xcite microscopy,@xcite and x - ray diffraction@xcite techniques .",

    "specifically , the absence of @xmath13 nesting between hole and electron fermi surface sheets prevents the leading @xmath14 pairing instability found e.g. within spin fluctuation mediated pairing.@xcite theoretical calculations for the superconducting ground state are currently inconclusive and predictions have been made for both @xmath4-wave @xcite and @xmath5-wave @xcite pairing symmetry .",

    "it is found that the presence of an interface between these two ordered phases leads to the formation of in - gap bound states which should be detectable by future stm measurements .",
    "bound interface states are generated for both @xmath5-wave and @xmath4-wave symmetry due to the magnetic nature of the bafm . a qualitative difference between @xmath5- and @xmath4-wave order is shown to arise near e.g. ( 110 ) non - magnetic scattering boundaries such as cracks , grain boundaries or free surfaces within the superconducting phase .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , in the next section we provide details of the model used for our calculations .",

    "<S> the high - t@xmath0 alkali doped iron selenide superconductors k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 have been recently shown to be intrinsically phase separated into fe vacancy ordered block antiferromagnetic regions and superconducting regions at low temperatures . in this work , we use a microscopic five orbital hubbard model to obtain the electronic low - energy states near the interfaces between block antiferromagnets and superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that abundant low - energy in - gap bound states exist near such interfaces irrespective of whether the superconductor has @xmath4- or @xmath5-wave pairing symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , it is shown how nonmagnetic scattering planes can provide a natural means to distinguish between these two leading pairing instabilities of the k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 materials . </S>"
