    "the rapid technological development of short  pulsed lasers during the last decade made it possible to produce and detect particular states , coherent superpositions of stationary electron states for a wide variety of physical systems .",
    "the dynamics of these initially well localized wave packets is a subject of much current investigation in many areas of physics and chemistry @xcite .",
    "an extensive research by means of both theoretical and experimental methods has brought an understanding of the intriguing phenomena of a hierarchy of collapses and revivals for particularly prepared wave packets in jaynes ",

    "we construct new solutions of time dependent schrdinger equation for spherical harmonic oscillator ( ho ) .",
    "we use these solutions further for description of the evolution of wave packets representing a particle with spin moving in ho potential with additional spin  orbit interaction .",
    "time dependent partial waves allow for much clearer interpretation of subtle interference effects as well as for a substantial acceleration of numerical codes used for graphical presentation of a complicated wave packet motion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we construct time dependent partial waves for the harmonic oscillator and show the decomposition of coherent states into these states . in section 3",
    "we show the motion of individual partial waves . in section 4",
    "we discuss time dependent spinors corresponding to solutions of time dependent schrdinger equation for hamiltonian containing spin  orbit interaction and show a possibility of evolution of an initially localized wave packet into a toroidal shape and backwards . sections 5 and 6 present graphical illustrations of the wave packet motion and conclusions .",
    "it is not so well known that there exist simple time dependent partial waves which are solutions of the schrdinger equation of the three dimensional oscillator .",
    "the proof will be given below .",
    "we look for solutions @xmath2 of the time dependent schrdinger equation for the spherical harmonic oscillator ( with @xmath3 ) with the following form @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 must be determined in terms of a complex number @xmath7 .",
    "we find easily that @xmath6 must obey the differential equation @xmath8\\ , w_l = 0 \\label{equ2}\\ ] ] with a new variable @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath6 depends only on this variable if @xmath11 solves the equation @xmath12 within an arbitrary constant factor , which is not written the solution is @xmath13 the equation solved by @xmath6 becomes @xmath14\\,w_l = 0 \\label{equ6}\\ ] ] which is the equation for the modified spherical bessel functions .    in the following",
    "we will use only the modified spherical bessel functions of the first kind with the usual conventions of the literature @xcite @xmath15 \\;. \\label{equ7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the interpretation of these waves is very simple : there is an harmonic motion in the radial part of the wave function keeping the angular part the same because of angular momentum conservation .",
    "the partial waves @xmath2 just defined occur in a  natural way in the expansion of a  coherent time dependent gaussian wave packet into partial waves .",
    "in such a  wave packet the constant @xmath7 finds its interpretation by combining the position of the center of the wave packet @xmath16 to its mean momentum @xmath17 at a  time @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 and @xmath20 be such vectors at time @xmath21 and let us define @xmath22 while @xmath23 these two vectors are related by @xmath24 a normalized gaussian wave packet centered on @xmath19 with mean momentum @xmath20 is now written as @xmath25 using 10.2.36 from reference @xcite the modified bessel function of the first kind of argument @xmath26 appears in the expansion of the last exponential of ( 12 ) @xmath27 and @xmath7 is defined as @xmath28 in a gaussian wave packet all the time dependent partial waves share the same parameter @xmath7 .",
    "however it is possible to consider more general wave packet for which @xmath7 might be different for different @xmath29 .",
    "the legendre polynomial @xmath30 depends on the ( complex ) angle @xmath31 between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "however this angle is time independent .",
    "indeed for each direction @xmath34 , @xmath35 one has @xmath36 as well as equation ( 11 ) , therefore @xmath37+y[y(t)+i p_y(t)]+z[z(t)+i p_z(t ) ] }   { r_t\\ , r } \\\\   & = & \\frac{x[x(0)+i p_x(0)]+y[y(0)+i p_y(0)]+z[z(0)+i p_z(0 ) ] }   { r_0\\ , r } \\;.   \\nonumber \\label{equ16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then if the complex direction @xmath38 , @xmath39 of @xmath40 is introduced through @xmath41 one writes the addition formula : @xmath42 we can now rewrite @xmath43 as @xmath44 we will now extract the function @xmath11 ( 5 ) in order to show explicitly the time dependent partial waves @xmath45 the classical energy @xmath46 has been introduced above .",
    "the time dependent partial waves ( 1 ) which appear in the gaussian wave packet at time @xmath21 are then expressed as : @xmath47 the gaussian wave packet ( 19 ) can now be expressed as follows in terms of ( 21 ) @xmath48 clearly one obtains a solution of the schrdinger equation only if we change the phase",
    ". let @xmath49 be this solution @xmath50 the weight @xmath51 of the time dependent partial wave @xmath2 is now seen to be @xmath52    an expansion similar to equation ( 23 ) is found in reference @xcite . however the time dependence of the radial function is lacking in this reference as well as the phase which is needed to correct the gaussian wave packet .",
    "the existence of this phase is mentioned in some textbooks @xcite .",
    "let us define the phase of @xmath7 by @xmath53 the argument of the modified bessel function is @xmath54 .",
    "changing the initial conditions of the wave packet produces a  change of @xmath55 and of @xmath56 .",
    "however it is clear that the change of the phase can be taken into account in the radial partial wave @xmath57 by a  shift of the origin of time .",
    "it is therefore possible to analyse the different partial waves by assuming that @xmath58 .",
    "this possibility arises if @xmath59 , @xmath60 . for these values the gaussian wave packet performs a  linear motion .",
    "it is striking that the radial motions of the partial waves corresponding to such a  case contain all the proper information which can be used for all the different trajectories , i.e. circular or elliptical .",
    "the differences between the trajectories will be introduced by the coefficients @xmath61 .    in the following figures we have chosen to study the radial waves for the mean energy @xmath62 i.e. @xmath63 .",
    "the 8 lowest partial waves present in the development of a  gaussian wave packet are represented in figure 1 @xmath0as a  matter of fact we have represented the density multiplied by @xmath64 $ ] for a  time range going from @xmath18 to @xmath65 ( @xmath66 is the harmonic oscillator period ) .",
    "the densities exhibit the same motion toward the origin and of course this radial motion is symmetric with respect to @xmath67 .",
    "however there is clearly an effect of the centrifugal barrier since the waves with the highest @xmath29 are repelled from the origin . also some secondary maxima are present .",
    "it is worth to mention once again that the effects of the centrifugal barrier cancel when one adds the waves to produce a  linear motion .",
    "we should also note that the spread of the partial waves does not depend on @xmath29 in a  significant manner .    in figure 2 the squares of 16 lowest partial waves ( @xmath68 )",
    "are represented as functions of @xmath69 for @xmath18 .",
    "the concentration of the waves at the same @xmath69 is spectacular .",
    "the intensity of the waves increases when @xmath29 goes from @xmath70 to @xmath71 and decrease afterwards . in order to explain the concentration of the wave in three dimensions",
    "the angular part plays a  role as will be discussed later on .",
    "we will now study the evolution of a coherent wave packet which is initially in a  pure spin eigenstate chosen as @xmath72 . this wave packet will evolve on the action of the harmonic oscillator evolution operator @xmath73 and of the spin ",
    "orbit part @xmath74 . as in our previous papers",
    "@xmath01822@xmath1 $ ] we will use the spin ",
    "orbit hamiltonian with a  constant factor @xmath75 : @xmath76 and therefore @xmath77 commute with @xmath78 .",
    "the hamiltonian contains the ratio of the two time scales ( let us recall that @xmath79 ) @xmath80 the fully normalized spinor is written at time @xmath18 as @xmath81 we have shown previously [ 4 ] that @xmath82 with the following operators @xmath83 @xmath73 transforms @xmath40 into @xmath33 while @xmath74 acts on the spherical harmonics present in the @xmath84 .",
    "the result is    @xmath85 } \\\\   & \\times & \\sum_{lm}\\ , c_{lm}(\\vec{r}_0)\\ , w_l(r_t r)\\ , \\left ( \\begin{array}{r } ( f_l+mg_l)\\,y^m_l(\\theta,\\varphi ) \\\\",
    "\\frac{1}{2}\\,g_l\\ , \\sqrt{l(l+1)-m(m+1)}\\ : y^{m+1}_l(\\theta,\\varphi ) \\end{array } \\right ) \\ ; ,   \\nonumber \\label{equ33}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are simply obtained from ( [ equ30 ] ) and ( [ equ31 ] ) by replacing @xmath88 by @xmath89 .",
    "this expression corresponds to the most general initial condition with the assumed initial spin direction .",
    "the presence of the time dependence in the functions @xmath90 and @xmath91 from one hand , the presence of @xmath92 in the lower part of the spinor are the two differences which change in an appreciable manner the time evolution in the case where @xmath93 .",
    "we want now to concentrate our efforts on the evolution of a  wave packet which is cylindrically symmetric around @xmath94 for @xmath18 .",
    "we assume therefore ( denoting unit vector in @xmath94 direction by @xmath95 ) @xmath96 @xmath97 let us study the sign of the product @xmath98 along the @xmath94 axis i.e. @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "one has @xmath101 all the partial waves act coherently in the direction @xmath99 while there is a  destructive interference for @xmath100 .",
    "we also know that there is a  radial concentration of the wave packets shown on figure 2 .",
    "this explains mainly the known result that the wave packet is initially a  gaussian centered at @xmath102 .",
    "in the direction @xmath103 we have @xmath104 while for @xmath29 even its sign is @xmath105 .",
    "a  destructive interference between the even states is also predicted on the @xmath106 plane with a  different character as for the @xmath107 direction .    we will now try to repeat these arguments for @xmath108 for each component of the spinor ( 33 ) . for the part with @xmath109 we must find the phase of the product @xmath110 . at a  time @xmath111 ( assuming @xmath112 ) we have for high @xmath29 : @xmath113 the coherence of the product considered is now obtained for @xmath103 and for even @xmath29 .",
    "it is interesting to see that the part with @xmath114 has still cylindrical symmetry around @xmath94 but moreover if @xmath115 or @xmath116 we shall have the result of figure 2 i.e. a  high radial concentration of the wave .",
    "one readily understand that at this time the wave is highly peaked on a  vortex of radius @xmath117 with symmetry around @xmath94 , the smaller radius of the vortex being roughly the initial radial spread .",
    "as for the part with @xmath118 we must discuss the sign of the product @xmath119 @xmath120 also for @xmath121 and for @xmath103 .",
    "now @xmath122 if @xmath29 is even , its sign for odd @xmath29 is @xmath123 while @xmath124 has also this sign since @xmath125 however we have also @xmath126 . in the case of the part with @xmath127 it is the odd partial waves which produce a  vortex similar to that to the part with @xmath114 in the limit of high @xmath29 .",
    "a  difference occurs in a @xmath128 dependent phase .    for intermediate values of the time it is not possible to provide a  similar discussion",
    "however , by continuity we can understand that the vortex rings are created from the spherical initial wave packet and get their full extension for the configuration and at the time chosen .",
    "the manifestation of the vortex rings depends on the parameter @xmath75 .",
    "it is simpler to freeze the evolution under @xmath77 and to consider only the spin  orbit evolution to begin with in order to emphasize the effect .",
    "figures 3 and 4 represent the density of the full wave packet at various times on the planes @xmath129 and @xmath130 , respectively . here",
    "also we have considered the wave packet which was analyzed in figure 2 .",
    "@xmath0for convenience the spin direction is @xmath131 and @xmath132 at time @xmath133 $ ] . at time",
    "@xmath18 a  gaussian is represented . at time",
    "@xmath134 a vortex ring has been created and gets the maximum radius at @xmath115 when intersecting the plane @xmath129 .",
    "moreover figure 4 shows that even a  second vortex with a  smaller amplitudes has also been created that we can not explain into simple terms . at time",
    "@xmath135 the vortex ring has a  decreasing radius and is centered on a  point with @xmath136 .",
    "finally at time @xmath137 the wave packet is reassembling near a  point with @xmath138 . at this time",
    "we have shown in our previous papers that the spin is approximately reversed .",
    "finally the behaviour for @xmath139 has not been shown for it is totally reversible if we assume a  frozen oscillator .",
    "the vortex rings evolve approximately on a sphere .",
    "the intersections of the wave packet with a  plane @xmath130 shown on figure 5 present indeed the feature that the distance to the center is about @xmath117 at all times .",
    "the following figure 6 shows the decomposition of the toroidal wave packet into its spin components in a direction perpendicular to the classical motion .",
    "the left and central columns display the shapes of subpackets in which spin field is antiparallel and parallel to em ox axis , respectively . due to symmetry with respect to em oz axis ( classical trajectory ) , the similar decomposition with respect to spin components in an arbitrary direction perpendicular to em oz axis results in a picture rotated by a certain angle .",
    "the dynamics of wave packets in static potentials implies subtle interference effects which have been beautifully illustrated in the case of coulomb potential @xmath09 - 14,16@xmath1 $ ] .",
    "two general mechanisms have been identified : one is the spread of the wave on the top of a classical trajectory , the other is the regime of partial and also almost complete recurrences . in the case of a pure harmonic oscillator",
    "the existence of a single frequency allows a unique interference mechanism of the partial wave that leads to a dispersionless coherent wave packet .",
    "this is the case where quantum mechanics comes closer to classical mechanics : the dynamics of the density probability is identical to the dynamics of the density distribution of the classical ensemble .",
    "this property is expected to be lost if a perturbation is added to the potential . if the perturbation is a spin  orbit potential the dynamics of the problem resembles very much that of the jcm @xcite .",
    "there exist two versions @xcite of this model where the time evolution is exactly periodic in the closest analogy to our model : the raman coupled model and the two photons jcm . in the harmonic oscillator with spin ",
    "orbit the dynamics is however richer if one follows the angular evolution with different initial conditions .",
    "we have shown previously @xcite that the amount of partial revival for half a spin  orbit period depends indeed on these conditions .",
    "we have discussed extensively @xcite cases where the wave packet is divided into two parts which rotate in opposite directions on a circular average    trajectory in much the same way as the stern  gerlach effect . in the present paper",
    "we have shown a new dynamical behaviour for cylindrically symmetric initial conditions : vortex rings are created and destroyed periodically . in a way this is a case where the coherence of the wave is kept for the @xmath69 and @xmath140 coordinates but where the spread is applied only to the @xmath141 variable .",
    "it is an open question whether this effect relies only on the properties of the partial waves of the harmonic oscillator discussed in this paper",
