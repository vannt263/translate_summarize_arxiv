    "dye molecules under high - intensity illumination degrade,@xcite a process called photodegradation .",
    "photodegradation is typically characterized by the irreversible breaking of bonds , which is accompanied by a change in the linear absorption spectrum when the molecule transitions from its pristine state to a damaged one .",
    "dye lasers are a well known example of a liquid solution,@xcite solid solution@xcite or in a sol - gel@xcite in which the active dye solute degrades under such photochemical reactions upon prolonged exposure .",
    "self - healing of the optical properties of a dye - doped polymer fiber was first observed by peng and coworkers with fluorescence probing,@xcite but was not further studied .",
    "howell independently observed self - healing in the anthraquinone dye disperse orange 11 ( do11 ) doped into poly ( methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) polymer using amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) as a probe,@xcite and was the first to apply kinetic models to determine rate constants and predict the intensity - dependence .",
    "these studies suggested that the decay rate decreases when cylcing the material through several periods of decay / recovery and such cycling could also increase the ase efficiency .",
    "these observations led to the proposal that cycling dye doped polymers through intervals of damage and recovery might be a method for making more robust materials .",
    "it is important to stress that these self - healing materials are not specially designed to heal after photodegradation .",
    "the materials studied here and the processes responsible are not related to the large body of literature on self - repair of polymers after microcracking , where the material incorporates a microencapsulated healing agent that is released upon crack intrusion@xcite . in the present studies , the dopant dye chromophores and the surrounding polymer undergo light - induced chemical processes in",
    "which bonds may be broken or rearranged , which are reversed upon healing  probably at the molecular level .",
    "howell also showed that dyes that irreversibly photodegrade in liquid solution@xcite self - heal when the same experimental protocol is used with dyes that are instead embedded in a polymer host . in the dye laser literature ,",
    "self healing is associated with the replenishment of fresh dye into regions where dye was damaged through mass transport and mixing .",
    "our definition of self healing is the literal recovery of the pristine molecule from its damaged state rather than a damaged molecule being merely replaced by a a fresh one .",
    "howell meticulously made a sample chamber that was uniformly illuminate to eliminate reservoirs of undamaged dyes .",
    "embaye et al . used photochromism experiments during decay to show that reorientational diffusion ( sometimes called orientational hole burning ) is absent , so is not a likely mechanism.@xcite ramini and dawson applied an analysis of samples that were imaged during decay and recovery to show that mass transport of molecules away from the burn area during damage and towards it in the dark during recovery was absent based on the evolution of the optically - imaged burn profile.@xcite these set of experiments eliminated all of the standard explanations and suggested that a new type of mechanism was at play .",
    "embaye s observations that the recovery rate accelerates for samples with high dye concentrations@xcite suggested that aggregates of dyes might be responsible for recovery , where larger aggregates both protect the molecules within them and foster their recovery .",
    "the fact that increasing the temperature decreases the recovery rate led to the hypothesis that domains form in analogy to condensates , where the average size of an aggregate decreases as the temperature increases .",
    "ramini and coworkers developed a statistical mechanical condensation model based on only one adjustable parameter that quantifies the sticking energy of a molecule to a domain.@xcite this model was applied to disperse red 1 azo - dye - doped pmma polymer data to determine the sticking energy ( about @xmath0 ) , from which the distribution of sizes was determined .",
    "the measured temperature - dependence agreed with the model over a wide range of measurements .",
    "later , anderson developed an imaging technique that has the ability to determine the population of damaged molecules as a function of intensity over a broad range of doses,@xcite which was used to fine tune the domain model.@xcite the resulting model was found to apply to even a broader range of experimental parameters , strengthening the case for its veracity .",
    "the domain model assumes that each molecule sticks to two others , so domains are inherently quasi - one - dimensional .",
    "domain models with higher - order dimensionality make predictions that disagree with the data . to further investigate this property ,",
    "the effect of an applied electric field on the kinetics of photodegradation and self - healing were experimentally studied.@xcite the quasi - one - dimensional model was generalized to take into account the effect of an applied field , which induces a dipole moment in each molecule , thus affecting the interactions between them .",
    "these self - consistent dipole field models correctly predict the measurements , reinforcing the confidence in the model .",
    "there is no doubt that self healing is a real phenomenon .",
    "indeed , the effect is being used to make lasers that heal.@xcite .",
    "however , many questions remain , such as the mechanisms of domain formation and how domains mediate healing .",
    "dirk proposed that a tict configuration might be responsible.@xcite to test such hypotheses requires independent measurement techniques .",
    "each suffers from unique challenges .",
    "amplified spontaneous emission in ase - active materials such as the anthraquinones studied in the present work is a highly sensitive probe because it differentiates strongly between the pristine molecule and the damaged species .",
    "extensive measurements of the dye disperse orange 11 ( do11 ) suggest that ase emissions are registered only for the undamaged molecule and since the ase intensity is a nonlinear function of the population density , its sensitivity is greater than for a linear measurements such as absorption spectroscopy .",
    "the downside is that ase is also a highly sensitive function of pump intensity , thus being more susceptible to laser drift . as such , photodegradation and self - healing are easily observed ; but , the measured time constants are prone to inconsistencies .",
    "indeed , drift over the long time periods required to fully characterize recovery ( on the order of 24 hours ) can distort what is a simple single exponential curve to what appears to be multi - exponential .",
    "furthermore , calibrating the ase intensity as a function of concentration requires carefully controlled measurements that take into account absorption gradients that develop during photodegradation .",
    "these factors can lead to difficulties in obtaining quantitative data .",
    "linear absorbance , on the other hand , is a linear process , so the the amount of light absorbed is directly proportional to the number of molecules in the beam s path .",
    "however , since the absorption spectrum of the pristine and damaged species overlap , both contribute .",
    "to unentangle one from the other requires the determination of the wavelength dependence of the absorbtion cross section of the pristine dye ( which is simple since pristine samples are available ) ; but a purely decayed sample can not be made because self healing continually converts the damaged product back to the original one . separating the two is especially difficult if the two spectra have substantial overlap .",
    "the issue is complicated even more by the fact that an irreversible species is also present , so that when enough of the self - healing species is present to be measurable , the data is contaminated with the irreversible species .    in the present work ,",
    "we use fluorescence spectroscopy as a probe.@xcite it is a linear process so does not have to be well calibrated , and as we will later show , the damaged species do not appear to contribute a measurable amount of signal in the spectral range of the measurement . as such , fluorescence probing appears to have all of the advantages without any of the drawbacks .",
    "we describe when the technique is applicable and use it to characterize self healing in a large number of anthraquinone molecules to both characterize the kinetics and to determine which structural features are associated with healing .",
    ".molecules from the _ amine class _ of anthraquinone molecules .",
    "dye c , with a diagonal red slash , is not observed to self - heal reproducibly , though some runs show recovery above noise levels .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : corsssectionskey ]    table [ tab : corsssectionskey ] shows a summary of the absorption cross - sections and absorption lengths for the sample made from dye b. the @xmath1 absorption length at the pump wavelength is about @xmath2 , which is much shorter than the typical sample thicknesses of @xmath3 .",
    "after maximum burn , the @xmath1 absorption length increases to @xmath4 . as such",
    ", the concentration profile of damaged molecules spreads deeper into the sample ; but , most of the pump light is absorbed within the sample for the duration of the burn . as a result , the same number of photons are absorbed .",
    "since the damaged molecules do not fluoresce , the fluorescence power is reduced in proportion to the number of damaged molecules present that absorb the pump light .",
    "if the sample were transparent at the fluorescence measurement wavelength , changes in the measured fluorescence intensity would be be an accurate representation of the fractional change of the number of pristine molecules due to decay or recovery .",
    "because light from the deeper regions must travel further before exiting , more of the fluorescence is absorbed if the optical density of the sample increases at the measurement wavelength .    for a ballpark estimate of the amount of fluorescence light that is absorbed on its way to the detector ,",
    "we assume that the light is on average produced at a point in the sample where the pump intensity is attenuated by a factor of @xmath1 , which for the undamaged sample is @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath1 absorption length of the light emitted at the observed fluorescence peak is @xmath5 . as such ,",
    "the fraction of fluorescence signal that makes it out of the sample from the interior is given by @xmath6 = 0.95 $ ] .",
    "at the end of the burn experiment , the pump light penetrates @xmath7 into the sample , at which time the @xmath1 absorption length at the fluorescence peak is @xmath8 .",
    "the fraction of the light making it to the detector is then given by @xmath9 = 0.85 $ ] .",
    "as such , the change in fluorescence signal observed during an experiment will be due to a convolution of : ( 1 ) the change in the amount of damaged molecules produced ",
    "which do not fluoresce ; ( 2 ) the longer distance that the light needs to travel to exit the sample ; and , ( 3 ) the larger optical extinction of the damaged molecules that the light must traverse . the latter two effects combine to decrease the fluorescence signal by about 10% .",
    "since the observed fluorescence is a linear process , this self - absorption effect leads to an underestimate of the undamaged population by about 10% .",
    "a strategy for avoiding problems associated with the change in absorbance of the sample during burning is to tune the pump laser to one of the isosbestic points - one of which falls conveniently near the @xmath10 pump line ; and to probe fluorescence at the other isosbestic point .",
    "it is far easier to isolate one part of a fluorescence spectrum than to tune the pump laser , so we concentrate on evaluating the approach of fluorescence probing at the isosbestic point .    to test this strategy , we first consider the degree of degradation determined from the fluorescence power at the peak and at the isosbestic point during photodegradation .",
    "the data in figure [ fig : flu - dec - rec - peak - iso ] shows that at the peak , the fluorescence power falls to @xmath11 of its initial value during a degradation experiment  a 30% decrease . at the isosbestic point , in the same experiment and at the same time",
    ", the intensity falls to @xmath12 of its initial value  a 26% decrease .",
    "clearly , both experiments give values that are close but outside of experimental uncertainties .",
    "however , a back - of - the envelope calculation of self absorption above predicts that the measurement at the peak should result in a 10% larger decrease in the fluorescence intensity than at the isosbestic point .",
    "thus , given the actual decrease of 26% at the isosbestic point , the self - absorption calculation predicts that at the fluorescence peak , the decrease should be 29% , in good agreement within experimental uncertainties .",
    "figure [ fig : flu - dec - rec - peak - iso ] shows the fluorescence intensity at the isosbestic point and at the peak for dyes a and b during decay and recovery at room temperature .",
    "the curves are fits to an exponential .",
    "the same experiment is repeated as a function of temperature and the time constants determined from the fits are plotted as a function of temperature in figure [ fig : flu - time_constants - b ] .",
    "the decay and recovery time constants determined from probing at the isosbestic point are for the most part within experimental uncertainties of the values determined from the peak fluorescence",
    ". however , the decay time constants determined from the peak fluorescence intensity are systematically below the ones determined at the isosbestic points while the recovery time constants tend to be larger when determined at the peak .",
    "though an accurate determination of the time constants requires that the fluorescence probe wavelength be coincident with the isosbestic point to avoid changes in self absorption that bias the data , time constants determined from data taken at the fluorescence peak are reliable enough for studies that seek to compare trends in different chromatophores .",
    "as such , absorption measurements are generally not needed to determine the isosbestic points unless accurate numerical results are needed .",
    "we use the approximate approach to study a series of anthraquinone dyes to search for structural features in molecules that are associated with healing and to determine if the temperature dependence of recovery follows a barrier model or a domain model .",
    "these will be described later .",
    "figures [ fig : flu - dec - rec - amines ] and [ fig : flu - dec - rec - hydroxy ] show the change in the fluorescence spectra at room temperature during photodegradation and recovery for the amine and hydroxy group of dyes .",
    "the light blue dashed curve shows the spectrum after recovery superimposed on the sets of curves taken during decay for comparison .",
    "all the spectra have in common several features .",
    "first , the recovery times are much longer than photodegradation times and the fluorescence spectrum never fully recovers over experimental timescales .",
    "the implication is that either an irreversibly damaged species is formed that never recovers , or there are at least two mechanisms for healing , in which case one of the mechanisms acts over timescales that exceed typical experimental durations .",
    "the light blue dashed curves that are superimposed on the fluorescence spectra taken during decay are generally of approximately the same shape as the spectra during photodegradation .",
    "small differences can be attributed to drift in the spectrometer and the apparatus .",
    "these data support the hypothesis that one mechanism is at work . alternatively ,",
    "if two species are being formed  and only one recovers , the fact that the recovery spectra retrace the decay spectra in reverse would suggest that the two species have the same spectral shape within experimental uncertainties .",
    "the third and most likely hypothesis is that all of the degraded species , reversible or not , do not fluoresce , so only the undamaged species is probed .",
    "one notable exception is dye j , where it appears that an irreversibly - damaged species is produced during photodegradation that does not recover but produces a feature in the fluorescence signal .",
    "the purported irreversible species is associated with the dip at @xmath13 , which does not recover , and is superimposed on the broader fluorescence peak , just above @xmath14 , of the recovering species .",
    "most likely , this feature is due to the formation of a species that absorbs the fluorescence light . as such ,",
    "the decrease in fluorescence is most likely due to the combined effect of the depletion of undamaged molecules , which is responsible for the dip at above @xmath14 and the accumulation of an irreversibly - damaged species that absorbs light at @xmath15    figure [ fig : flu - dec - rec ] shows the peak fluorescence intensity at room temperature as a function of time of the dyes that recover ( points ) .",
    "the curves are exponential fits to the data during decay ( red ) and recovery ( blue ) .",
    "the decay and recovery curves are measured and fitted to exponentials for several temperature to determine the decay and recovery time constants as a function of temperature .",
    "figure [ fig : flu - dec - rec - temp ] shows the results of such an analysis of all the dyes analyzed in figure [ fig : flu - dec - rec ] .",
    "there are two competing models of the self - healing mechanism , as described by ramini and coworkers in each of two papers.@xcite .",
    "the most intuitive one is that the photo - degraded species is of higher energy than the fresh molecule , but is trapped in a well with an energy barrier that prevents it from recovering . in this scenario ,",
    "an increase in temperature would increase the tunneling rate , and hence decrease the time constant .",
    "the temperature dependence observed here and in past studies suggest that the time constant decreases with temperature .",
    "the observation of deceased tunnelling rate with increased temperature in do11 dye led ramini and coworkers to propose the correlated chromophore domain mechanism , which proposed that molecules aggregate into protective domains , which foster healing in proportion to the size of the domain.@xcite as the temperature is increased , this model proposes that the competition between thermal jiggling and the chemical potential that binds molecules to a domain causes the domains to break apart .",
    "the smaller domains then lead to a slower recovery rate .",
    "this model fits the data well but is at odds with the predictions of a barrier model .",
    "however , hung has proposed that in similar dyes , these observations might be consistent with a gaussian distribution of barrier energies , which yields a stretched exponential distribution of the time constants.@xcite the trends of the data here seem to contradict this hypothesis .",
    "another goal of the present work is to asses the structural features of a molecule that are associated with healing after photodegradation .",
    "the trends in the data suggests that the key feature is the proximity of an @xmath16 or @xmath17 group to the central oxygen atom . as a whole , proximity to",
    "the oxygen seems to be a common trait , which might be critical in understanding the mechanism .",
    "figure [ fig : false - color ] shows the evolution of the fluorescence spectrum during decay and recovery of the fluorescence spectrum of dye e. the shape of the spectrum is the same during recovery , suggesting that the fresh material degrades into a species that recovers . if multiple damaged species are formed , none of them emit fluorescence in the range measured .",
    "dye e does not fit well into the other two classes .",
    "however , the ring to the upper left of the structure is near the central oxygen , thus following the pattern that proximity between the oxygen and a group attached to the adjacent site is the key feature for reversible photodegradation .",
    "dye c is a problematic one because having one amine group and one hydroxy group , it is a combination of the two classes that show self - healing , yet recovery is ambiguous .",
    "while the other molecules that recover do so reproducibly , dye c is rarely observed to self - heal , and when it does , the degree of recovery is small .",
    "the top graph in figure [ fig : dyec - decay - recover ] shows photodegradation in fluorescence .",
    "the loss of fluorescence signal indicates photodegradation that is similar to the other dyes , so the material is clearly not damaged before the start of the experiment .",
    "furthermore , the linear absorption spectrum shows a well - defined peak characteristic of a fresh sample .",
    "the middle graph in figure [ fig : dyec - decay - recover ] shows one of the rare instances where recovery was observed , through the degree of recovery is small .",
    "the bottom graph shows the signal at the peak during decay and recovery .",
    "given that recovery is rare , and small when it is observed , we have characterized the material as non - recovering . however , we admit that a small amount of recovery is possible .",
    "it is puzzling that this molecule contains the groups associated with robust healing , yet does not significantly heal .",
    "perhaps this has something to do with the fact that it is a mixture of the two classes so that competing effects work against each other .",
    "this observation calls for a more in - depth focus on this molecule , which is beyond the scope of the present paper , which seeks to find general trends associated with healing .",
    "many questions remain . are the domains real physical structures or are they correlations between molecules that are mediated by coupling to a polymer chain ?",
    "direct scattering measurements will need to be applied to search for aggregates of molecules distributed in size and space as predicted by the model , which would be strongly suggestive of real physical domains .",
    "what are the nature of the domains and what are the forces that hold them together ?",
    "this question could be answered with fourrier transform infra red ( ftir ) measurements that map out which bonds are affected during decay and recovery .    the present work on a set of varied molecules suggest that anthraquinone molecules with @xmath17 and @xmath16 groups adjacent to the central oxygen atom are the ones that self heal .",
    "the importance of proximity of an atom or molecular group to the central oxygen is bolstered by the observation that dye e , with a ring in that position , also heals .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the observed recovery rates generally decrease with increased temperature suggests that the domain picture might the correct one . however , more complex explanations that rely on distributions of barriers may revive activation energy models .",
    "fluorescence measurements , as described here , need to be applied to other systems that show self healing such as rhodamine 6g@xcite to broaden our understanding of what types of structures are required for healing .    while each characterization method suffers from unique drawbacks , fluorescence in anthraquinone dyes",
    "seem to be immune from the need to correct for spectral changes inherent to the decay process because the degraded species appear to not fluoresce significantly where the emission wavelengths of pristine molecules peak .",
    "furthermore , the wavelength of the isosbestic point of the linear absorption spectrum can be used as the wavelength to monitor fluorescence , thereby eliminating the need to correct for the change in the absorbance of the probe light by the sample during photodegradation and recovery . as such",
    ", the technique proposed here may be ideal for the future study of self healing .",
    "other refinements may be required to fully take advantage of this approach , including pumping at an isosbestic point to control for changes in the pump s penetration depth , and taking into account the fact that the pump intensity is brightest at the surface , where more of the irreversible species might be generated .",
    "though self healing has been observed in many materials , the mechanisms remain a mystery . a deeper understanding of the processes at work will undoubtedly lead to interesting new science , and the fluorescence technique described here may be one of the best tools for the job .",
