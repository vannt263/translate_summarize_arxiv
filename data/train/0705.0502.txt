    "the dominating idea in the modern theory of highly excited strongly interacting systems is that phase randomization time is the shortest time scale of the problem  @xcite .",
    "application of this idea to the theory of quantum chaotic scattering for colliding systems with rotationally invariant hamiltonians implies the absence of correlations between the reaction amplitudes carrying different total spins  @xcite .",
    "however , though seemingly plausible , the assumption of a very fast phase relaxation is not consistent with many data sets on complex quantum collisions .",
    "in particular , the anomalously long - lived spin off - diagonal @xmath0-matrix correlations have been identified from the data on forward peaking of evaporating protons in nucleon induced  @xcite and photonuclear  @xcite reactions .",
    "such long - lived correlations reflect an anomalously slow phase relaxation , which is many orders of magnitude longer than the energy relaxation .",
    "this provides a manifestation of a new form of matter : thermalized non - equilibrated matter introduced by one of us in refs .",
    "the effect is of primary importance for many - qubit quantum computation since anomalously long `` phase memory '' can extend the time for quantum computing far beyond the quantum chaos border  @xcite .",
    "an effect of a very slow phase relaxation has also been strongly supported by numerical calculations for h+d@xmath4  @xcite , f+hd  @xcite and he+h@xmath5  @xcite state - to - state chemical reactions . in these calculations ,",
    "a slow phase relaxation manifests itself in stable rotating wave packets of the intermediate complexes  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this same effect of stable coherent rotation was originally revealed for heavy ion collisions , _",
    "e.g. _ , for @xmath6f+@xmath7y  @xcite , @xmath3si+@xmath8ni  @xcite , @xmath9c+@xmath2 mg  @xcite , @xmath2mg+@xmath2 mg and @xmath3si+@xmath3si  @xcite , @xmath10ni+@xmath11ti and @xmath10ni+@xmath12ni  @xcite collisions .    in this paper",
    "we reveal the effect of slow phase relaxation for yet another heavy ion scattering system , @xmath2mg+@xmath3si .",
    "this effect is studied in relation to quasiperiodic energy dependence of the cross sections , coherent rotation of the hyperdeformed @xmath1 intermediate complex , schrdinger cat states and quantum - classical transition for @xmath2mg+@xmath3si heavy ion scattering .",
    "we consider first the scattering of spinless collision partners with spinless collision fragments in the exit channel .",
    "using the semiclassical asymptotics of legendre polynomials for @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the total spin of the system , we represent the cross section in the form @xmath15 with @xmath16 , @xmath17.\\ ] ] in these expressions , @xmath18 is the energy independent potential scattering cross section , @xmath19 is the average deflection angle obtained from a linear approximation for the @xmath14-dependence of the potential phase shifts in the entrance and exit channels , @xmath20 is the average partial reaction probability , and @xmath21 are normalized , @xmath22 , energy fluctuating around zero @xmath0-matrix elements corresponding to time - delayed collision processes . the brackets @xmath23 stand for the energy @xmath24 averaging .",
    "in the expression for @xmath25 we have dropped ( i )  the highly oscillating angle interference term between the @xmath26 and @xmath27 amplitudes , and ( ii )  the interference terms between the energy smooth potential scattering amplitude @xmath28 and energy fluctuating amplitudes @xmath29 .",
    "this is because the excitation functions data for @xmath2mg+@xmath3si scattering  @xcite were obtained by averaging over a wide @xmath30 angular range .    in calculating the cross section energy autocorrelation function ,",
    "@xmath31 we take into account the @xmath0-matrix spin off - diagonal correlation  @xcite @xmath32 is the angular velocity of the coherent rotation of the intermediate complex , @xmath33 is the spin phase relaxation width and @xmath34 is the total decay width of the intermediate complex .",
    "we take @xmath20 in the @xmath14-window form , @xmath35 , where the average spin @xmath36 , for a given c.m .",
    "energy of the collision partners , is close to the grazing orbital momentum .",
    "the @xmath14-window width @xmath37 relates to the effective number of partial waves , @xmath38 , contributing to @xmath39 . for the analyzed @xmath2mg+@xmath3si scattering we estimate @xmath40 , which is revealed by the shape of the measured elastic scattering angular distributions  @xcite corresponding to the maxima of the excitation functions .",
    "although these angular distributions show regular oscillations with a well - defined period , they clearly deviate from the square of a single legendre polynomial .",
    "we estimate the energy dependence of @xmath36 in the linear approximation and obtain @xmath41 . here ,",
    "@xmath42 , @xmath43 is the energy corresponding to the center of the energy interval over which the cross section is measured , @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the coulomb barrier for the collision partners in the entrance channel for a configuration of the two touching spherical nuclei @xmath2 mg and @xmath3si .",
    "we calculate @xmath46 under the conditions @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we take @xmath20 in the gaussian form , @xmath50 $ ] . generalizing the calculations in  @xcite to the case of finite @xmath33 and arbitrary @xmath51 for the normalized ( @xmath52 ) cross - section energy autocorrelation function ,",

    "the above expression for @xmath55 has been obtained for @xmath56 .",
    "one can see that @xmath57 has the physical meaning of the imaginary part of the angular velocity signifying the space - time delocalization of the nuclear molecule and the damping of the coherent rotation of the intermediate complex  @xcite . for @xmath58",
    ", @xmath46 is an oscillating periodic function with period @xmath59 . for finite @xmath33 , the amplitude of the oscillations in @xmath46 decreases with increasing @xmath60 : the larger @xmath33 the stronger the damping of the oscillations . for @xmath61 and @xmath62 , eq .",
    "( 5 ) transforms to the result in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although eq .",
    "( 5 ) is obtained for spinless reaction fragments it also holds for reaction products having intrinsic spins .",
    "this can be shown using the helicity representation for the scattering amplitude  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "1 we present the energy autocorrelation functions for the @xmath2mg+@xmath3si elastic and inelastic scattering  @xcite , constructed from the data on the excitation functions measured on the @xmath63 mev energy interval  @xcite .",
    "the experimental excitation functions were averaged on the @xmath64 angle interval .",
    "the experimental @xmath46 s are not lorentzian but oscillate with a period @xmath65 mev .",
    "the fit of the experimental @xmath46 s for _ all _ the elastic and inelastic channels is obtained with @xmath66 mev , @xmath67 mev , @xmath68 mev and @xmath69 .",
    "the calculated @xmath70 s are normalized to the experimental data at @xmath71 .",
    "the extracted value of @xmath59 suggests an anomalously strong deformation of the intermediate complex .",
    "indeed , for @xmath72  @xcite , using the moment of inertia of a @xmath73 superdeformed intermediate complex , corresponding to the two touched spherical colliding nuclei @xmath2 mg and @xmath3si , we have @xmath74 mev .",
    "this value is bigger by a factor of about 2.5 than the period of oscillations in the experimental @xmath70 s .",
    "this reveals the excitation of @xmath1 hyperdeformed coherent rotational states of the intermediate complex .",
    "it should be noted that the intrinsic excitation energy of the intermediate complex , which we obtain by substracting deformation and rotation energy for the total energy , is about 15 mev or more .",
    "this corresponds to the average level spacing of @xmath75 mev or less .",
    "therefore , the intermediate complex is in the regime of strongly overlapping resonances , @xmath76 . in this regime ,",
    "the theory of quantum chaotic scattering and random matrix theory are conventionally assumed to apply  @xcite . in accordance with these approaches , which in particular reconfirmed the ericson theory of the compound nucleus cross - section fluctuations  @xcite ,",
    "the spin off - diagonal @xmath0-matrix correlations vanish yielding @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "the lorenzian curves presented in fig . 1 with @xmath78 mev to fit the experimental data at @xmath79 mev are clearly in contrast with the oscillations in all the experimental @xmath55 s . within our approach ,",
    "the limit of vanishing spin off - diagonal @xmath0-matrix correlations corresponds to @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the characteristic spin phase relaxation time .",
    "therefore , the persistence of the oscillations in @xmath55 indicates an anomalously long spin off - diagonal `` phase memory '' .    in fig .",
    "1 we present another possible fit of the experimental @xmath46 s with the same @xmath66 mev and @xmath68 mev , but with the different values @xmath82 mev and @xmath83 .",
    "one can see that both the fits are qualitatively and quantitatively undistinguishable .",
    "the question arises if the quantities of the interest , in particular the phase relaxation width @xmath33 , can reliably be determined from the data .",
    "consider the time ( @xmath84 ) power spectrum of the collision for the spinless reaction partners in the entrance and exit channels . unlike the cross section energy autocorrelation function in the previous section",
    ", the time power spectrum will be studied for a fine angular resolution .",
    "the time power spectrum is given by the fourier component of the amplitude energy autocorrelation function  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath85 , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath86 , the continuous spectrum approximation is valid and we have  @xcite @xmath87^{1/2 }   \\exp[i(\\phi-\\omega t)(j - j^\\prime ) -\\beta |j - j^\\prime |t/\\hbar ] p_j(\\theta)p_{j^\\prime}(\\theta).\\ ] ] here , @xmath88 are legendre polynomials , and the heaviside step function @xmath89 signifies that the intermediate complex can not decay before it is formed at @xmath90 .    in fig .",
    "2 we present @xmath91 for three moments of time and for the two different sets of the parameters for which the @xmath70 s were calculated in the previous section ( fig .",
    "the first set is : @xmath66 mev , @xmath68 mev , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath82 mev , @xmath83 . for the second set we have different values of @xmath67 mev , @xmath69 while the rest of the parameters is unchanged .",
    "for the reason discussed in  @xcite the time power spectra in fig .",
    "2 are scaled with the @xmath94 , which is given by eq .",
    "( 6 ) , where only the spin diagonal terms @xmath95 are taken into account .",
    "such a spin diagonal approximation corresponds to the limit of quantum chaotic scattering and random matrix theory  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , deviation of the scaled time power spectra in fig . 2 from a constant unity is a quantitative measure of the deviation of the collision process from the universal limit of the quantum chaotic scattering theory  @xcite .",
    "2 illustrates a rotation of the two wave packets towards each other .",
    "as the wave packets rotate they also spread - the bigger @xmath33 the faster the spreading .",
    "one observes that , for @xmath82 mev and @xmath83 , the contrast of the interference fringes , due to the interference between the near - side and far - side amplitudes  @xcite , is very strong .",
    "these interference fringes is a manifestation of schrdinger cat states in highly excited quantum many - body systems  @xcite . on the contrary , for @xmath67 mev and @xmath69 ,",
    "the contrast of the interference fringes is greatly reduced indicating a quantum - classical transition in the collision process  @xcite .",
    "our approach shows that the complicated many - body collision problem can be accurately represented by the simple picture of a weakly damped ( @xmath96 ) quantum rotator .",
    "this picture was obtained without introducing any collective degrees of freedom of the intermediate complex , such as its deformation and spatial orientation .",
    "the introduction of those degrees of freedom is known to be a successful approximation  @xcite for very low , closed to yrast line , intrinsic excitations of the intermediate complex . yet , in our case of high intrinsic excitations ( @xmath97 mev ) , the collective degrees of freedom acquire large spreading widths  @xcite , @xmath98 , and by consequence they decay much faster than the average life - time of the intermediate complex .",
    "notice that @xmath99 can be obtained from the data for excitation function fluctuations for binary collisions , for fine energy and angular resolutions , provided the relative contribution of direct processes is significant ( @xmath100 )  @xcite .",
    "the latter is usually the case for heavy - ion elastic and inelastic scattering .",
    "experimentally , fine energy  @xcite and angular  @xcite resolutions required for the determination of @xmath99 are routinely achievable for heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a reliable determination of the phase relaxation width @xmath33 , which is an important new energy scale in quantum many - body systems  @xcite , is experimentally possible .",
    "we have discussed the effects of slow phase relaxation , spin off - diagonal @xmath0-matrix correlations on the cross section energy oscillations and the time evolution of the highly excited intermediate system formed in the @xmath2mg+@xmath3si collision .",
    "such quasiperiodic energy oscillations were observed experimentally .",
