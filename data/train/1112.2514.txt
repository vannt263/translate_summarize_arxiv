    "in relativistic heavy ion collisions , a hot and dense fireball is produced in the overlap zone .",
    "it is believed that at early times this fireball is made of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "experiments aimed to study properties of qgp are going on at brookhaven national laboratory s relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and at cern s new large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "large amounts of data are already accumulated that helps to develop realistic theoretical models of the collision process and deconfinement - hadronization transition .",
    "no single approach has so far been able to describe all the aspects of this complicated process , however , several successful models have been proposed . among the most popular is the hydrodynamical model , where the qgp is assumed to evolve as an almost perfect fluid .",
    "such approach was first proposed by landau almost 60 years ago @xcite , and since that time its different versions are used to describe nuclear collisions at intermediate and high energies ( see the recent paper @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one may expect , that in the course of fast expansion , this fluid will split into many droplets which later on evolve by evaporating hadrons from the surface @xcite .",
    "the idea is that the strong collective expansion of matter , as seen in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , may lead to overcooling and subsequent fragmentation of the plasma phase into droplets surrounded by a low - density hadron gas .",
    "the dynamical implications of such a scenario were studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will present a simple model of relativistic dynamics of a hot quark - antiquark droplet which may be created in this first step of the hadronization of a rapidly - expanding quark - gluon plasma .",
    "our model is motivated by earlier works @xcite , where a simplified hydrodynamic model with hadron emission was used to describe the dynamics of a quark(-gluon ) droplet . in our present approach",
    "we additionally consider effects of the surface tension and use the entropy balance equation for determination of the temperature .",
    "also we present a detailed study of the droplet trajectories in collective coordinates .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , starting from hydrodynamic equations , we derive a simple model to describe evolution of an individual quark droplet . in section 3 ,",
    "semi - analytical solutions of this model are obtained for the idealized case of no hadron emission . in section 4 , the hadron emission from the droplet is included following a statistical approach . in section 5 ,",
    "we present results of numerical simulations of the droplet evolution taking into account the hadron emission .",
    "conclusion and outlook are given in section 6 .",
    "let us consider a droplet consisting of deconfined matter at about critical temperature . as model calculation , show , under such conditions",
    "the gluons acquire a large mass and are strongly suppressed by the boltzmann factor @xcite .",
    "we take , therefore , only quarks and anti - quarks , in consideration .",
    "the quark - antiquark plasma inside the droplet is described by the hydrodynamic equations as a perfect fluid which is characterized by its rest frame energy density @xmath0 , isotropic pressure @xmath1 and spherically - symmetric velocity field @xmath2 with @xmath3 being the distance to the center of the droplet . for the equation of state , we use , the mit bag model i.e. an ideal gas of massless quarks and antiquarks confined in the spherical cavity of radius r(t ) .",
    "the energy momentum tensor of the fluid is represented as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the metric tensor @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 is the collective 4-velocity .",
    "the last term in this expression corresponds to the energy - momentum tensor of the `` false '' vacuum inside the droplet , characterized by the energy density @xmath8 ( bag constant ) .",
    "let us first consider an idealized case where the droplet does not emit particles from the surface .",
    "then the dynamics of the fluid follows the energy - momentum conservation equation for @xmath9 : @xmath10 in the considered case the entropy is also conserved i.e. expressed by the equation : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the entropy density .",
    "furthermore , we can add the continuity equation expressing the conservation of quantum numbers such as baryon charge and strangeness : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the corresponding number density .",
    "from these equations , we will now derive the global dynamics of the droplet .",

    ", we should specify the model parameters and initial conditions for the droplet evolution . as already stated above , for calculation of the droplet bulk energy we use the mit bag model .",
    "one should bear in mind , however , that in an equilibrated system this model predicts a first - order phase transition between the quark - gluon plasma and a hadron gas at all @xmath35 and @xmath36 , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",

    "@xcite , the qgp phase produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions may split into droplets due to a strong collective expansion .",
    "below , we assume that deconfinemed matter inside these droplets may exist in a metastable state at temperatures as low as 150 mev and @xmath41 . to describe this state",
    "we apply the bag model with bag constant @xmath42 , which is slightly lower than the standard value around @xmath43 . with this choice",

    "@xcite , within the mit bag model with massless quarks , the standard surface term proportional to @xmath47 vanishes , and the curvature term proportional to @xmath48 has a negative sign .",
    "the implications of this term for finite - size quark - gluon droplets in the mixed phase of the deconefinement phase transition , were studied in ref .",
    "the author s conclusion is that this correction is rather small ( around 30 % ) , even for droplet radii about 1 fm , and negligible for radii @xmath49 .",
    "the mit bag model assumption of an idealized sharp boundary of the quark bag might not be realistic enough to correctly describe the surface properties .",
    "other approaches , which are based on effective field - theorectical models , usually predict a non - vashing surface energy .",
    "this energy is associated with the gradients of the mean fields ( condensates ) in the transition region between inside and outside of the droplet .",

    ", we can make two conclusions : first , the inclusion of heavier particles in the emission process leads to a significant enhancement of the energy emission rate , and second , even moderate initial collective velocity leads to strong droplet oscillations and pulsed hadron emission .",
    "we have presented a simple hydro - kinetic model of a quark droplet evolution , which takes into account bulk and surface contributions to the energy , collective expansion and hadron emission from the surface .",
    "if hadron emission is disregarded , the droplet behavior is described by anharmonic oscillations .",
    "we have found an approximate solution for these oscillations using a super - ellipse parametrization of the phase - space trajectories . in the limit of small - amplitude ,",
    "the period of oscillations is also proportional to the droplet radius .",
    "when hadron emission is included , the motion is changed to damped oscillations characterized by the decay time , which in first approximation is proportional to the droplet radius . for droplets with initial radii 1.5 - 2",
    "fm these lines lie in the interval 9 - 16 fm/@xmath90 .",
    "our calculations show that pions account for about 2/3 of the emitted hadrons , but they carry away only 50 % of the energy .    in this paper we have considered only baryon - free droplet made of quarks and antiquarks with zero chemical potentials .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for plasma produced at rhic and lhc energies @xcite . at lower collision energies effects of baryon asymmetry",
    "become more and more important .",
    "so , in the future , we are planning to include non - zero chemical potentials and investigate asymmetry between baryon and anti - baryon emission .",
    "then , we can study such interesting phenomena as cold stranglet formation and flavor distillation @xcite .",
    "the possibility of instantaneous hadronization of the dilute plasma @xcite should be considered as well .    in our calculations , we have made an assumption that the droplet keeps a spherical shape at all times .",
    "this assumption can of course be questioned because the recoil effect from the emission , the rayleigh - taylor instability due to viscosity and collective quadrupole modes could lead to an asymmetric shape or even a bulged or fingered surface of the droplet . the recoil effect due to hadron emission",
    "can most likely be dismissed due to a stochastic nature of the emission process , i.e. the random directions of the emitted particles will lead to a cancellation of the recoil momenta due to individual particle emissions .",
    "also , the surface tension should work against a non - spherical shape , trying to minimize the surface area of the droplet .    for a more realistic description",
    ", one could introduce viscous terms in the energy - momentum tensor , and study their impact on the dynamics of the droplet .",
    "it is clear , however , that these terms will damp collective oscillations but not change dramatically the life time of the droplets , which is mainly determined by the hadron emission rate .",
    "also , the finite - size corrections to the droplet energy should be studied in more detail , in particular , higher - order terms in @xmath139 expansion should be introduced .",
    "these terms could play an important role at late states of the droplet evolution .",
