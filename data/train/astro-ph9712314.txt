    "the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) has at least 6 populous star clusters with @xmath19 : ngc 121 , ngc 416 , kron 3 , ngc 339 , lindsay 1 , lindsay 113 . to within the measurement errors , they all have metallicities in the range @xmath20 and horizontal branch ( hb ) morphologies that are predominantly redward of the rr lyrae instability strip .",
    "ground - based observations suggest that these clusters have significantly different ages despite their similar metallicities . for example , stryker ( @xcite ) estimate that ngc 121 is @xmath012 gyr old . in the case of ngc 339 ,",

    "the uncertainty in the ages of these systems underscores just how little we know about the early evolutionary history of the smc .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the first ccd observations of the smc populous star cluster ngc 416 .",
    "we estimate and compare various properties of ngc 416 , lindsay 1 , and lindsay 113 , in order to improve our knowledge of the the formation history of the small magellanic cloud .",
    "the smc globular cluster ngc 416 was observed with the _ hubble space telescope _ wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on 1994 february 6 through the f450w ( @xmath0@xmath2 ) and f555w ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) filters .",
    "the wfpc2 pc1 aperture ( biretta @xcite ) was centered on the target position of @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( j2000.0 ) and two high - gain observations were obtained : 400-s in f450w and 200-s in f555w . the two datasets ( f450w : u26m0501 t ; f555w : u26m0502 t ) were recalibrated at the canadian astronomy data centre and retrieved electronically by us using a guest account which was kindly established for kjm .",
    "the data were analyzed with the ccdcap digital circular aperture photometry code developed by mighell to analyze _ hst _",
    "wfpc2 observations ( mighell @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were transformed to johnson @xmath2 and @xmath1 using the standard wfpc2 equations given in tables 10 and 7 , respectively , of holtzman ( @xcite ) .",
    "these color equations were recently used by mighell ( @xcite ) to show that the age of large magellanic cloud cluster hodge 11 is identical to that of the galactic globular cluster m92 with a relative age - difference uncertainty ranging from 10% to 21% .",
    "complete details of the photometric reduction of these ngc 416 observations are given in mighell ( @xcite ) .",
    "in the following sections , we compare the cluster properties of ngc 416 with two other smc populous clusters , lindsay 1 and lindsay 113 .",
    "before we can proceed with this comparison , we require @xmath23 photometry for all three clusters . while @xmath23 photometry exists for lindsay 1 ( olszewski @xcite ) , none is available in the literature for lindsay 113 .",
    "we converted the @xmath24 photometry of mould ( @xcite ) to the @xmath23 system using the color transformation equation mag , sarajedini & geisler ( @xcite ) found the following color transformation equation , @xmath25 , which has an rms error of 0.018 mag .",
    "] of sarajedini & geisler ( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath1 @xmath26 color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) of our observed stellar field in ngc 416 reach @xmath27 mag and are displayed in fig .  [ fig-1 ] .",
    "we have arbitrarily split our observations into two regions : ( 1 ) the `` cluster '' region [ pc1 ccd : see fig .",
    "[ fig-1]b ] and ( 2 ) the smc `` field '' region [ wf2 , wf3 and wf4 ccds : see fig .",
    "[ fig-1]c ] .",
    "we statistically removed the smc field population from the cluster region cmd ( fig .",
    "[ fig-1]b ) following the procedure described in mighell ( @xcite ) which is similar to , but more conservative than , that used in the hodge 11 study of mighell ( @xcite ) .",
    "a total of 2826 stars are probable cluster members and they are displayed in the cleaned cluster cmd ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-1]d ) .",
    "this cmd cleaning method is probabilistic and fig .",
    "[ fig-1]d therefore represents only one out of an infinite number of different possible realizations of the cleaned ngc 416 cmd .",
    "the metallicity and reddening of a globular cluster can be determined simultaneously , in an internally consistent manner , using the magnitude level of the horizontal branch ( hb ) , the color of the red giant branch ( rgb ) at the level of the hb , along with the shape and the position of the rgb ( sarajedini & norris @xcite ) .",
    "the simultaneous reddening and metallicity ( srm ) method has subsequently been developed for use with several standard filter combinations : @xmath1 @xmath28 ( sarajedini @xcite ) , @xmath29 @xmath30 ( sarajedini & geisler @xcite ) , and @xmath1 @xmath31 ( sarajedini & layden @xcite ) .",
    "we now apply the latter version to our photometry of ngc 416 .",
    "first , we estimate the magnitude of the ngc 416 red hb by considering all stars with @xmath32 and @xmath33 mag .",
    "this yields @xmath34@xmath6@xmath35 mag , where the quoted error reflects our estimate of the uncertainty in the photometric zeropoint .",
    "we find that the mean color of the hb is @xmath36@xmath6@xmath37 mag ; the error being the standard error of the mean .",
    "we fitted a 4th order polynomial to the rgb stars , using the iterative 2@xmath38 rejection algorithm described by sarajedini & norris ( @xcite ) , which gives the color of the rgb at the level of the hb as @xmath39@xmath6@xmath40 mag . using the srm method with these parameters ,",
    "we determine that the metallicity and reddening of ngc 416 are @xmath41@xmath6@xmath42 dex and @xmath43@xmath6@xmath15 mag , respectively , where the errors have been estimated following the prescription of sarajedini ( @xcite ) .",
    "the metallicity of a cluster can also be determined from the slope of the rgb .",
    "it has been well established that more metal - rich clusters possess rgbs with shallower slopes . to quantify this behavior",
    ", we follow the work of hartwick ( @xcite ) and define the rgb slope with the parameter @xmath44 $ ] , where @xmath45 designates the @xmath26 color of the rgb at a point 2.5 magnitudes brighter than the hb .",
    "we find the relation between metallicity , @xmath46 , and the globular cluster rgb slope parameter , @xmath47 , to be @xmath48 , from a weighted least - squares fit to the primary and secondary calibrating globular clusters ( excluding lindsay 1 ) of sarajedini & layden ( @xcite ) .",

    ", we find that @xmath50@xmath6@xmath51 mag and @xmath52@xmath6@xmath53 for ngc 416 , and therefore calculate a metallicity of @xmath54@xmath6@xmath55 which is in good agreement with the results of the srm method . a reddening estimate of e@xmath56",
    "is then derived using eq .",
    "( 1 ) of sarajedini & layden ( @xcite ) .",
    "a weighted mean of the srm method results and that derived via the rgb slope analysis gives @xmath57@xmath6@xmath8 and @xmath58@xmath6@xmath14 mag , which will serve as our adopted values for ngc 416 in the remainder of this paper .",
    "following the above procedures , we applied the srm method and the rgb slope method to the @xmath23 photometry of lindsay 1 and lindsay 113 in order to estimate their metallicities and reddenings ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the fact that our metallicity and reddening estimates for lindsay 1 and lindsay 113 are fully consistent with the values previously adopted by the authors of that photometry suggests that our metallicity and reddening analysis procedures provide reasonable and believable results .",
    "the most robust age determination techniques are those that deal with the measurement of relative ages . as such ,",
    "we have chosen to study the age of ngc 416 relative to two other smc populous clusters , lindsay 1 and lindsay 113 .    in the previous section",
    ", we determined that ngc 416 , lindsay 1 , lindsay 113 have similar metallicities ( @xmath59 dex ) .",
    "if we make the naive assumption that these clusters are also the same age , then their horizontal branches should have the same luminosity .",
    "likewise , if the @xmath23 cluster photometry for ngc 416 and lindsay 113 were shifted to give the same @xmath1 magnitude for the horizontal branch , @xmath60 , then the apparent @xmath1 turnoff magnitudes , @xmath61 , of these clusters would also be identical .",
    "figure [ fig-2 ] performs this experiment .",
    "our @xmath1 @xmath26 fiducial sequence of lindsay 1 is compared with our transformed @xmath23 photometry of lindsay 113 in fig .",
    "[ fig-2]a .",
    "similarly , our lindsay 1 fiducial sequence is compared with our ngc 416 photometry in fig .",
    "[ fig-2]b .",
    "even though the photometric scatter is large at the main - sequence turnoff region , one can clearly see that most of the subgiant branch stars of lindsay 113 are brighter than most of the subgiant branch stars of ngc 416 which , in turn , are brighter than the fiducial subgiant branch of lindsay 1 . remembering that these clusters have similar metallicities , we see that fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] provides graphical evidence suggesting that the age sequence of these three smc populous clusters is lindsay 1 , ngc 416 , and lindsay 113 with lindsay 1 being the oldest .    wishing to verify and quantify that this age sequence is correct , we now seek corroborative evidence in the morphology of the cluster horizontal branches .",
    "sarajedini ( @xcite ; hereafter sll ) proposed an age indicator for globular clusters with predominantly red horizontal branches based on the @xmath26 color difference , @xmath5 , between the the mean color of the red horizontal branch ( clump ) and the red giant branch at the level of the horizontal branch .",
    "we measured the value of @xmath5 in lindsay 1 , ngc 416 , and lindsay 113 following the procedure described by sll ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the errors in @xmath5 are quite small because , by its very nature , @xmath5 is a differential quantity which makes it easy to measure with high precision .",
    "table 1 gives our estimates for the cluster ages and the absolute visual magnitude of the red horizontal branch clumps , @xmath62 , which were derived using the cluster metallicities and @xmath5 values with figs .",
    "4 and 5 of sll , respectively .",
    "the reader is reminded that the calibration of sll is based on the assumption that the galactic globular cluster 47 tuc is 13 gyr old and has @xmath63 dex .",
    "as expected , the ages inferred from @xmath5 have corroborated the proposed age sequence derived from the relative positions of the main sequence turnoffs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] ) : ngc 416 is younger than lindsay 1 ( by @xmath02 gyr ) but older than lindsay 113 ( by @xmath01.5 gyr ) .",
    "the @xmath5 ages we find for lindsay 1 and lindsay 113 agree well with previous age estimates in the literature .",
    "the age sequence of the three smc populous clusters that we have investigated is lindsay 1 , ngc 416 , and lindsay 113 with lindsay 1 being the oldest . from the data presented in table 1 we find that the age _ ratios _ of the younger clusters with respect to lindsay 1 are @xmath3 and @xmath64 which gives new absolute age estimates of @xmath65 gyr and @xmath66 gyr assuming the olszewski ( @xcite ) age scale where the age of lindsay 1 is 9 gyr .",
    "durand ( @xcite ) analyzed deep photographic plates from the 2.5-m du pont telescope at las campanas and produced a color - magnitude diagram of ngc 416 which they used to estimate an age of 2.5@xmath60.7 gyr .",
    "the following year , analysis of integrated photometry produced significantly older age estimates : 5.9@xmath61.9 gyr ( elson & fall @xcite ) and 8@xmath61.5 gyr ( bica @xcite ) .",
    "our estimate of 6.6@xmath60.5 gyr is in good agreement with the estimates based on integrated photometry rather than the estimate based on the analysis of a color - magnitude diagram .",
    "why did the supposedly more accurate technique of cmd analysis produce a significantly lower age estimate than predicted by integrated photometry ?",
    "durand ( @xcite ) found a concentration of stars in their ngc 416 cmd at @xmath67 mag and @xmath68 mag which they interpreted as being the cluster main - sequence turnoff .",
    "we find no such concentration in our color - magnitude diagrams and note that the main - sequence turnoff of ngc 416 is below the apparent plate limit of the durand ( @xcite ) study ; this strongly suggests that the concentration was probably an artifact of their photometric analysis / subtraction process .",
    "while integrated photometry of ngc 416 did produce a better age estimate than that based on deep photographic photometry , ages determined from integrated photometry can also be unreliable .",
    "elson & fall ( @xcite ) determined that ngc 416 and lindsay 113 have s - parameter values of 46 and 49 , which translated to ages of 5.9@xmath61.9 gyr and 11@xmath63 gyr , respectively , using their eq .",
    "they determined that lindsay 113 was 5 gyr _",
    "older _ then ngc 416 while we have found that lindsay 113 is @xmath030% ( @xmath01.5 gyr ) _ younger _ than ngc 416 .",
    "contaminating young main - sequence smc field stars near lindsay 113 ( see our fig .",
    "[ fig-2]a ) may have contributed enough ultraviolet light to cause the cluster @xmath69 color within the aperture to be measured too small ( blue ) which would have caused the s - parameter value ( hence age ) for lindsay 113 to be overestimated ( cf .",
    "geisler @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we note that the age estimates we have given in table 1 for ngc 416 and lindsay 113 were derived by extrapolating fig .  4 of sll to account for the fact that the measured @xmath5 values of these young clusters are smaller than @xmath00.15 mag .",
    "accurate ( relative ) ages for the intermediate - age populous clusters in the small magellanic cloud ( e.g.  via deep main sequence photometry ) would allow the @xmath5 method of sll to be _ recalibrated _ with star clusters that are significantly younger than 7 gyr .",
    "needless to say , these observations would also provide unique observational constraints on helium - core burning population ii stellar evolutionary models .",
    "such an extended @xmath5 method could prove be a very useful age diagnostic for future studies of the intermediate - age metal - poor stellar populations in local group galaxies where accurate main - sequence turnoff photometry at @xmath18 mag is currently not possible or practical .",
