    "hydrogen is a very common impurity in iron - based materials .",
    "it is incorporated into the material during production and service and exhibits a high mobility within the bulk phase .",
    "it has further been shown that microstructural defects in the material such as vacancies , dislocations , and grain boundaries can trap hydrogen impurities  @xcite .",
    "the resulting local accumulation of hydrogen at these defects can then lead to a degradation of the mechanical properties of the material , which is also referred to as hydrogen embrittlement  @xcite . to explain",
    "the complex mechanisms underlying hydrogen embrittlement various approaches have been developed including hydrogen - enhanced local plasticity ( help )  @xcite , hydrogen - enhanced decohesion ( hede )  @xcite and superabundant vacancy formation  @xcite .",
    "the most important aspects in trying to understand the behaviour of hydrogen within a material and its role in hydrogen embrittlement are the hydrogen solubility , the interaction of hydrogen with defects , and the hydrogen mobility .",
    "the solubility of hydrogen within pure bcc - fe is relatively low .",
    "point and extended defects , however , can provide interstitial sites that are energetically much more favourable for hydrogen than the tetrahedral site in bcc - fe . in a recent study we investigated the solution energy of h in the presence of open and close - packed grain boundaries ( gb ) in bcc- and fcc - fe  @xcite employing density - functional theory ( dft )  @xcite calculations .",
    "we find that in general hydrogen prefers the interstitial sites within the grain boundary region ( with the exception of close - packed grain boundaries in fcc - fe ) .",
    "in particular we find a large energy gain of @xmath0  ev for hydrogen interstitials at the @xmath1 ( 310)$ ] grain boundary in bcc - fe ( @xmath2 in short ) as compared to the bulk region .",
    "this indicates that hydrogen segregates to the grain boundary and is trapped there .",
    "the mobility of hydrogen within pure bcc - fe bulk is high .",
    "the calculated diffusion barrier for h atoms moving between neighbouring tetrahedral sites is @xmath3  ev  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with earlier experimental observations indicating that h diffuses rapidly within bcc metals  @xcite .",
    "experimental studies investigating the diffusion of hydrogen in the presence of dislocations , grain boundaries , and phase boundaries show that the measured diffusivity depends on the hydrogen concentration  @xcite . in bulk pd ,",
    "pd grain boundaries , and pd / al@xmath4o@xmath5 phase boundaries , the diffusion constant generally increases with increasing h concentration  @xcite . within a theoretical study employing kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations",
    "it was illustrated that the attraction of h to screw dislocations in fe materials can significantly affect h diffusion  @xcite . to properly evaluate the mobility of hydrogen within a certain material it is thus important to also consider the effect of the microstructure .    in this study",
    ", we employ kmc simulations to address h diffusion in the presence of grain boundaries in bcc - fe . in a previous study we found that the h diffusion barriers within the grain boundary region of bcc - fe are much higher ( @xmath6  ev )  @xcite than in the bulk region .",
    "this suggests that h interstitials diffuse relatively slowly or are effectively immobile within the grain boundary interface , and that therefore the grain boundaries do not provide fast diffusion channels for hydrogen .",
    "utilising the information about available interstitial sites , diffusion barriers , and solution energies extracted from our dft calculations , we set up a series of kmc models that represent idealised microstructures .",
    "the first model is an idealised cubic grain structure in bcc - fe , with and without point defects included in the bulk region of the grain . since the model grains are much smaller than grains in the actual material we consider in our second model a parallel arrangement of grain boundary interfaces .",
    "this layered structure naturally introduces an anisotropy in the diffusivity .",
    "the third model presented in this paper represents more detailed the structure of the @xmath2 grain boundary in bcc - fe . within the above models , h diffusion constants",
    "are determined as a function of h concentrations and temperatures . from the results obtained within these model systems general trends for h diffusivity in various structural environments can be extracted .",

    "thus at high concentrations where bulk diffusion has the largest contribution the overall diffusivity , @xmath71 , decreases . at all temperatures , diffusion perpendicular to the interface planes , @xmath73 , is slowest , due to trapping of h within the grain boundary region . with respect to diffusion in @xmath67-direction ( @xmath70 ) the kmc results for @xmath63  k suggest that the if3 site likewise acts as point trap .",

    "h is confined to the interface region and the diffusivity is low as compared to diffusion in perfect bcc - fe bulk . as the number of h atoms approaches the number of interface sites the diffusion constant drops due to blocking of available interstitial sites . at large h concentrations",

    "parallel to the interface diffusion is similar to the one observed within the grain structure .",
