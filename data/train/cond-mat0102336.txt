    "apart from their relevance to the description of ferrimagnetic materials , mixed - spin models are interesting from a purely theoretical point of view , being among the simplest models to exhibit tricritical behavior .",
    "so they are especially convenient for studying the effects of inhomogeneities on the phase diagrams and the multicritical behavior of magnetic systems . from a few exact @xcite and several approximate @xcite calculations",
    ", we now have a good picture of the phase diagrams of mixed spin-@xmath0spin-@xmath1 ising models in the presence of a crystal field .",
    "our aim in this work is to use this model hamiltonian to investigate the effects of disorder on the location of the transition lines and the tricritical point .",
    "the mixed - spin ising model is described as a two - sublattice system , with spin variables @xmath2 and @xmath3 , on the sites of sublattices @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . restricting the interactions to nearest - neighbors ( belonging to different sublattices ) and single - ion terms , the most general spin hamiltonian in even spin space",
    "is written as @xmath6 where the first sum is over nearest - neighbor pairs , the second sum is over the sites of sublattice @xmath5 , and the parameter @xmath7 is assumed to be positive ( ferromagnetic exchange ) . for @xmath8 ,",
    "the crystal field favors the @xmath9 states ; the competition between anisotropy and ferromagnetic exchange terms leads to the appearance of a tricritical point .",
    "it should be pointed out that one needs three parameters to describe the even space of the better known spin-@xmath1 blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) model . in the present case of a mixed - spin ising system , from the point of view of the calculations ,",
    "the reduction of the analysis to a two - parameter space is a particularly attractive feature .",
    "there are exact calculations for the thermodynamic functions associated with the model hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ smp ] ) on a simple chain and on some three - coordinated two - dimensional structures . on a honeycomb lattice",
    ", the problem can be mapped onto a spin-@xmath0 ising model on a triangular lattice , which does not display a tricritical point.@xcite this mixed - spin model can also be exactly solved on a bethe lattice @xcite ( the deep interior of cayley tree ) , leading to the same results of a recent cluster - variational calculation.@xcite the results on a bethe lattice with coordination @xmath10 indicate the absence of a tricritical point for @xmath11 , as confirmed by migdal ",

    "this association is easy to see if we note that a uniform crystal field @xmath16 leads to @xmath9 for all @xmath18 , which breaks the connectivity between the spin-@xmath19 variables .",
    "the presence of a randomly located distribution of @xmath20 crystal fields recovers that connectivity and , for sufficiently high values of @xmath21 , leads to the formation of a percolating cluster . in the rather artificial case of annealed disorder , on the honeycomb lattice",

    "it is interesting to remark that this solution in the annealed case reproduces the critical concentration of the percolation problem associated with the ground state of the model with quenched ( frozen ) disorder , which is equivalent to the usual percolation problem on the triangular lattice .",
    "for the physically more relevant case of quenched disorder , there are approximate calculations using an effective - field theory with correlations,@xcite which point to the ( expected ) weakening of the tricritical behavior due to the presence of disorder .    in the present work ,",

    "this critical end point separates the first - order line into two distinct regions : ( i ) at higher temperatures , there are transitions between the usual , high - density ( @xmath50 as @xmath48 ) ferromagnetic phase ( ferro - i ) and the paramagnetic phase ; ( ii ) at lower temperatures , the transitions are between the ferro - i and ferro - ii phases , the first - order boundary ending at a finite - temperature critical point , @xmath51 .    for @xmath52 ,",

    "the central site is occupied by a spin @xmath57 , connected to @xmath10 spins of the @xmath17 type . in the other cluster , called @xmath5 , there is a central @xmath17 spin surrounded by @xmath10 spin-@xmath0 variables . according to the standard prescription of the bethe ",

    ", we might introduce different effective crystal fields to mimic the extended disorder of real materials .",
    "however , we expect that , in the absence of external magnetic fields , the assumption of a single @xmath60 is reasonable , at least in the paramagnetic phase , where there is no long - range order ; in particular , we expect that the paramagnetic phase boundaries obtained by the two approaches are equivalent within the bethe ",
