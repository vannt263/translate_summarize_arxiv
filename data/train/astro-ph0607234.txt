    "the formation of the first luminous objects ends the cosmic  dark ages \" and begins a period of heating and ionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "the global thermodynamic history of this epoch , which culminates in reionization , depends upon many poorly constrained processes such as star formation , radiative feedback , and the growth of hii regions @xcite .",
    "currently , the best constraints on the ionization history come from observations of the gunn - peterson trough in quasar absorption lines @xcite and in wmap observations of the optical depth to recombination @xcite .",
    "current observations of the temperature evolution of the igm are similarly limited . at low redshift , observations of the ly@xmath3 forest place constraints on the temperature of the igm after reionization ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , photoionization during reionization causes a large temperature increase that essentially erases information about the preceding period . at high redshift",
    ", it is assumed that the gas cools adiabatically after thermal decoupling from the cmb at @xmath4 , when compton scattering becomes inefficient @xcite .",
    "the intermediate regime , where the first sources have  switched on \" , is poorly constrained .",
    "once collapsed structures form many different heating mechanisms are possible , e.g. , shock heating @xcite , resonant scattering of ly@xmath3 photons @xcite , and x - ray heating @xcite .",
    "determining the thermal history and identifying the important heating mechanisms requires new observations .",
    "future telescopes such as the _ james webb space telescope _ hope to image high - redshift sources directly",
    ". however , seeing the sources is not the same as seeing the heating and ionization they cause in the igm . the most promising technique for probing the thermal history of the igm before reionization is via observation of the 21 cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this line may be seen in absorption against the cmb , when the spin temperature @xmath5 is less than the cmb temperature @xmath6 , or in emission , when @xmath7 .",
    "three prototype low - frequency interferometers ( lofar , mwa , and past ) are under construction and should be capable of observing the redshifted 21 cm signal from gas at redshifts @xmath8 , with the proposed square kilometre array ( ska ) capable of probing even higher redshifts .",
    "a great deal of theoretical work has now been done in calculating the 21 cm signal from fluctuations in density @xmath9 @xcite , the ly@xmath3 flux @xmath10 @xcite , and the neutral fraction @xcite .",

    "we first build a model for the global thermal history of the igm following @xcite . in this model",
    ", we assume that a population of x - ray sources resulting from the remnants of the first stars is responsible for heating the igm @xcite .",
    "x - ray heating is dominated by soft x - rays ( @xmath13 ) , as harder x - rays have a mean free path comparable with the hubble scale . these long mean free paths have often motivated the simplifying assumption that x - rays heat the igm uniformly .",
    "in fact , clustering of the sources and the @xmath14 decrease of flux with distance combine to produce significantly inhomogeneous heating .",
    "we develop a formalism , based upon that of @xcite , for calculating the temperature fluctuations that are sourced by these inhomogeneities .",
    "we use this to explore features in the 21 cm power spectrum that constrain the evolution of @xmath12 .",
    "this calculation also motivates a consideration of the possibility of using 21 cm measurements to constrain the x - ray emission spectrum of the first sources .",
    "simulations of the early universe have yet to address the spectrum of temperature fluctuations in the period before reionization .",
    "previous analytic consideration of fluctuations in @xmath12 has focused on the period following recombination but before sources form @xcite .",
    "temperature fluctuations induced by the first sources have not previously been considered in detail .",
    "the 21 cm signal can be thought of as a tool for probing various radiation backgrounds .",
    "gas temperature fluctuations probe the x - ray background , neutral fraction fluctuations probe the ionizing uv background , and ly@xmath3 fluctuations probe the non - ionizing uv background .",
    "while the focus of this paper is x - ray heating of the igm , in practice , the different sources of 21 cm fluctuation are not cleanly separated . in order to properly establish context , we briefly re - examine the signal from fluctuations in the ly@xmath3 flux , incorporating ly@xmath3 production by x - ray excitation of hi @xcite , and determine whether this contains extra useful information for constraining the spectral properties of the x - ray sources .",
    "finally , we explore the feasibility of separating information on the temperature and ly@xmath3 flux fluctuations with the 21 cm signal .",

    "we shall explore this transition in more detail below .",
    "one of our key observables for 21 cm observations is the sign of @xmath52 , which indicates whether @xmath83 ( provided that collisional coupling can be neglected ) .",
    "having set the broad context , let us tighten our discussion with a concrete model for the evolution of the igm ; in this we follow @xcite .",
    "we will distinguish between the ionization fraction @xmath91 , relating to the volume filled by the highly ionized hii regions that are located around clusters of sources , and the free electron fraction @xmath92 of the largely neutral gas outside these hii regions .",
    "the former is important for determining when reionization occurs , while the latter governs x - ray heating in the bulk of the igm .",
    "we note that the volume filling fraction of the hii regions is well approximated by @xmath91 , which we will use to calculate volume averaged quantities .",
    "we further distinguish between @xmath12 , the temperature of the igm outside the hii regions , and the temperature of these photoionized regions @xmath93 . at high @xmath90 , these regions are small and will not have a significant effect ; while at low @xmath90 , where reionization is well advanced , these hii regions will dominate and invalidate our formalism .",
    "we begin by writing down equations for the evolution of @xmath12 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the heating rate per unit volume , and we sum over all possible sources of heating / cooling @xmath96 .",
    "we define @xmath97 to be the rate of production of ionizing photons per unit time per baryon applied to hii regions , @xmath98 is the equivalent quantity in the bulk of the igm , @xmath99 is the case - a recombination coefficient at @xmath100 , and @xmath101 is the clumping factor .",
    "we model the clumping factor using @xmath102 ; this value for @xmath103 reproduces the qualitative form of the histories in @xcite and ensures reionization at @xmath104 .",
    "this approximation is appropriate only while @xmath91 is small , and will fail towards the end of reionization , when clumping becomes important in determining the effect of recombinations @xcite .    in modelling the growth of hii regions ,",

    "is motivated by a picture of hii regions expanding into neutral hydrogen @xcite . in calculating @xmath113",
    ", we use the @xcite mass function @xmath114 and determine a minimum mass @xmath115 for collapse by requiring the virial temperature @xmath116 , appropriate for cooling by atomic hydrogen . decreasing this minimum mass , say to that of molecular cooling ,",
    "will allow star formation to occur at earlier times shifting the features that we describe in redshift .",
    "we note that @xmath117 at all redshifts under consideration , as once the free electron fraction reaches a few percent further x - ray energy is deposited primarily as heat , not further ionization .",
    "to integrate equation , we must specify which heating mechanisms are important .",
    "@xcite considers several heating mechanisms including shock heating @xcite and resonant scattering of ly@xmath3 photons @xcite .",
    "we shall neglect these contributions to heating of the igm , focusing instead on the dominant mechanisms of compton heating and x - ray heating .",
    "while shock heating dominates the thermal balance at low @xmath90 , during the epoch we are considering it , probably , heats the gas only slightly before x - ray heating dominates .",
    "compton heating serves to couple @xmath12 to @xmath6 at redshifts @xmath118 , but becomes ineffective below that redshift . in our context , it serves to set the initial conditions before star formation begins .",
    "the heating rate per particle for compton heating is given by @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the helium fraction ( by number ) , @xmath121 is the energy density of the cmb , @xmath122 is the thomson cross - section , and we define @xmath123    x - rays heat the gas primarily through photo - ionization of hi and hei : this generates energetic photo - electrons , which dissipate their energy into heating , secondary ionizations , and atomic excitation . with this in mind , we calculate the total rate of energy deposition per unit volume as @xmath124 where we sum over the species @xmath125hi , hei , and heii , @xmath126 is the number density of species @xmath45 , @xmath127 is the threshold energy for ionization , @xmath128 is the cross - section for photoionization , and @xmath129 is the number flux of photons of frequency @xmath130 . we may divide this energy into heating , ionization , and excitation by inserting the factor @xmath131 , defined as the fraction of energy converted into form @xmath45 at a specific frequency .",

    "care must be taken here , as the cross - sections have a strong frequency dependence and the x - ray frequency can redshift considerably between emission and absorption .",
    "in practice , the abundance of heii is negligible and may be neglected .",
    "x - ray heating is often portrayed as uniform , as the x - ray photons possess long mean free paths .",
    "the comoving mean free path of an x - ray with energy @xmath140 is @xcite @xmath141 thus , the universe will be optically thick , over a hubble length , to all photons with energy below @xmath142^{1/2}\\bar{x}_{\\rm{hi}}^{1/3}{\\ , \\rm{kev}}$ ] . the @xmath143 dependence of the cross - section means that heating is dominated by soft x - rays , which do fluctuate on small scales .",
    "in addition , though , there will be a uniform component to the heating from harder x - rays .",
    "we consider three possible sources of x - rays : starburst galaxies , supernova remnants ( snr ) , and miniquasars @xcite .",
    "the incidences of starbursts and supernova remnants are likely to be tied to the global star formation rate @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that miniquasars similarly track the star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "in reality , of course , their evolution could be considerably more complex @xcite .",
    "we characterise these sources by an emissivity per unit ( comoving ) volume per unit frequency @xmath144 where sfrd is the star formation rate density , and the spectral distribution function is a power law with index @xmath145 @xmath146 and the pivot energy @xmath147 .",
    "we assume emission within the band 0.1  30 kev , and set @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is a highly uncertain constant factor .",
    "this normalisation is chosen so that , with @xmath150 , the total x - ray luminosity per unit sfr is consistent with that observed in starburst galaxies in the present epoch ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "extrapolating observations from the present day to high redshift is fraught with uncertainty , and we note that this normalisation is very uncertain .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity at high redshift is constrained by observations of the present day soft x - ray back ground , which rules out complete reionization by x - rays , but allows considerable latitude for heating @xcite .",
    "similarly , there is significant uncertainty in the spectra of these objects .",
    "we choose @xmath151 for starbursts , @xmath152 for snr , and @xmath153 for miniquasars @xcite .",
    "these span the reasonable spectral dependence of possible x - ray sources .    as in equation",
    ", we model the star formation rate as tracking the collapse of matter , so that we may write the star formation rate per ( comoving ) unit volume @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the cosmic mean baryon density today .",
    "this formalism is appropriate for @xmath156 , as at later times star formation as a result of mergers becomes important .",
    "finally , we must describe the evolution of the ly@xmath3 flux .",
    "this is produced by stellar emission ( @xmath157 ) and by x - ray excitation of hi ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "photons emitted by stars , between ly@xmath3 and the lyman limit , will redshift until they enter a lyman series resonance .",
    "subsequently , they may generate ly@xmath3 photons , as discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "we see that the spectra alter the most on scales @xmath332 .",
    "the two main signatures are the change in amplitude and shift in the position of the trough .",
    "both of these occur because increasing the slope of the spectrum , with fixed total luminosity , increases the number of soft x - rays and so increases the heating in smaller scales .",
    "the trough ( or sign change in @xmath333 ) shifts by @xmath334 for @xmath335 , an effect that might be observable were it not located on small scales @xmath336 .",
    "the amplitude change at the peak is more observable but is also degenerate with modifications in the thermal history , making this a very challenging measurement to perform in practice .    referring back to our discussion of the time evolution of the signal ,",
    "we see that this sort of variation is similar to the effect of changing the thermal history . however , the exact shape of the spectrum is determined by the form of @xmath266 , and hence @xmath242 .",

    "we can also seek to constrain the x - ray spectrum by looking at the regime where fluctuations in the ly@xmath3 flux dominate the 21 cm signal .",
    "the inclusion of ly@xmath3 photons generated by x - ray excitation of hi ( in addition to those redshifting into the lyman resonances ) modifies the shape of the power spectrum significantly .",
    "this is easy to see by referring back to figure [ fig : wkcomp ] .",
    "there we plotted @xmath224 , for the case of stellar emission , and @xmath241 , which determines the fluctuations in the x - ray flux .",
    "if we allow both stars and ly@xmath3 photons produced from x - rays to contribute to the ly@xmath3 flux , then the resulting spectrum of fluctuations is determined by a weighted combination of these @xmath245 and @xmath241 . in our model , as in that of @xcite , the ly@xmath3 flux is dominated on small scales by the x - ray contribution and on large scales by the stellar contribution .",

    "we note that the shape of the spectrum is somewhat sensitive to the spectral index of the x - ray sources - with the variation being similar to between the stellar + x - ray and x - ray only curves . thus isolating the 21 cm fluctuations from the ly@xmath3 flux variations",
    "could also constrain the x - ray spectrum of the first sources .",
    "we now explore the effect of modifying the x - ray luminosity of our sources .",
    "we have so far taken @xmath150 in our analysis , but constraints on the high redshift x - ray background are weak giving us significant freedom to vary @xmath149 , which parametrizes the source luminosity . as an example , for our model a , values of @xmath339 are easily possible without x - ray or collisional ionization of the igm violating wmap3 constraints on @xmath340 at the 2-sigma level . in figure",
    "[ fig : fx ] , we show the time evolution of the 21 cm fluctuations for model a , taking @xmath341 , 1 , and 10 .",

    "this will make the 21 cm signal more complicated as temperature and ly@xmath3 fluctuations contribute over a similar range of redshifts .",
    "however , early heating also means that temperature fluctuations become unimportant for the 21 cm signal at late times improving the prospects for extracting cosmology from the 21 cm signal @xcite .",
    "in contrast , late heating ( dotted curve ) allows a clearer separation between temperature and ly@xmath3 fluctuations , but means temperature fluctuations are likely to be important during the beginning of reionization .",
    "this will complicate the extraction of information about hii regions as reionization gets underway .",
    "clearly there is considerable uncertainty as to the behaviour of the 21 cm signal at high redshifts due to our poor understanding of the source populations . viewed",
    "another way , measurement of the evolution of the 21 cm signal could provide useful constraints on the x - ray background at high redshift .",
    "this is important as efforts to observe the diffuse x - ray background are complicated by technical issues of calibration .",
    "we also note that for weaker x - ray heating other sources of heating , especially shock heating , may become important .",
    "finally we remind the reader that our model is applicable in the igm outside of ionized hii regions . if heating occurs late , so that temperature fluctuations are important as hii regions become large",
    ", then it will be important to extend this model if accurate predictions of the 21 cm signal during reionization are to be made .",
    "it will also be important to include these temperature fluctuations into simulated predictions of the 21 cm signal .",
    "we now turn to the important question of observing the features outlined above .",
    "the first generation of 21 cm experiments ( past , lofar , mwa ) will be optimised to look for the signature of hii regions at redshifts @xmath8 .",
    "their sensitivity decreases rapidly at redshifts @xmath156 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and so they are unlikely to be able to detect the effects of inhomogeneous heating .",
    "the proposed successor to these instruments , the ska , is still under design , but its fiducial specifications should allow the @xmath343 regime to be probed . in this section , we will consider using an ska type experiment to observe 21 cm fluctuations at @xmath279 and @xmath248 and calculate the achievable precision .    before this , we must make the necessary caveats concerning foregrounds .",
    "foregrounds for 21 cm observations include terrestrial radio interference ( rfi ) , galactic synchrotron emission , radio recombination lines , and many others ( @xcite ;  9 of @xcite ) .",
    "typical foregrounds produce system temperatures @xmath344 , compared to a signal measured in @xmath345 .",
    "these foregrounds increase rapidly as we move to lower frequency , making their removal an even greater concern for high redshift observations than low ones .",
    "although techniques for foreground removal are well grounded , their effectiveness has yet to be tested . in the analysis that follows ,",
    "we assume that foreground removal can be effected by exploiting the smoothness of foregrounds in frequency space ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "errors on @xmath305 for an ska like instrument ( see text for details ) .",
    "we compare spectra for model a ( thick curves ) and model b ( thin curves ) . modes with @xmath346 ( shown by a vertical dashed line ) will probably be lost during foreground cleaning . _",

    "figure [ fig : errorplot ] shows predicted @xmath347 error bars on @xmath348 at @xmath279 and @xmath248 for model a and b. we assume an ska like instrument with a total effective area @xmath349 distributed over @xmath350 antennae in a 5 km core , bandwidth @xmath351 , minimum baseline @xmath352 , and an integration time @xmath353 .",
    "we set @xmath354 and @xmath355 at these two redshifts and use bins of width @xmath356 .",
    "we assume that foregrounds can be removed exactly , but that this also removes cosmological information on scales exceeding the bandwidth of the observations , so that modes with @xmath357 ( indicated by vertical dashed lines ) are lost @xcite .    with these caveats , observations could measure @xmath348 accurately over the range @xmath358 .",
    "the precision is more than adequate to distinguish between model a and b. detecting the characteristic peak - trough signature of @xmath48 is difficult , as the trough typically occurs on small scales where the uncertainty is large .",
    "however , it should be possible to detect the peak and the beginning of the decline .",
    "we note that detection of the trough is necessary to unambiguously determine @xmath313 and so show that @xmath70 . without this",
    "it is not simple to distinguish between the two cases exemplified by the @xmath318 curve , which has no trough , and the @xmath248 curve , which does , in figure [ fig : tb_full_slice2 ] .",
    "no similar confusion occurs when the reduction in power caused by @xmath313 is obvious , as in the @xmath248 model b case .    from the point of view of constraining the spectra of x - ray sources ,",
    "the precision is adequate for distinguishing between the different curves of figure [ fig : tb_specl_a ] .",
    "whether the effect of the spectrum can be separated out from different thermal histories is an open question , which deserves future study .    throughout this work ,",
    "we have ignored the effect of the hii regions on the 21 cm power spectrum .",
    "while this is reasonable at high redshifts , this approximation will begin to break down as the filling fraction of ionized regions increases .",
    "the bubble model of @xcite predicts that these bubbles remain at sub - mpc sizes while @xmath208 .",
    "consequently , we naively expect contamination of the signal by these bubbles to be confined to small scale modes with @xmath359 that will be very difficult to detect . exploring",
    "the detailed interaction between temperature and neutral fraction fluctuations is beyond the scope of this paper , but may be important for detailed predictions of the 21 cm signal at the beginning of reionization .",
    "@xcite have considered the extraction of astrophysical and cosmological parameters from 21 cm observations in the period of the first sources .",
    "they assumed that gas temperature fluctuations showed no scale dependence @xmath360 and argued that extracting astrophysical information using an ska like instrument is difficult but feasible .",
    "we expect the scale dependent temperature fluctuations that we have investigated to both help and hinder parameter estimation .",
    "figure [ fig : errorplot ] shows that it should be possible to resolve individual features imprinted in the power spectrum by temperature fluctuations .",
    "these features provide additional leverage in extracting astrophysical parameters .",
    "however , the shape of the power spectrum evolves rapidly in our model , making binning of different redshift data more difficult .",
    "x - ray production by an early generation of stellar remnants is widely regarded as the most likely candidate for heating the igm above the cmb temperature from its cool adiabatic level . this heating has often been treated as uniform , as the mean free path of hard x - rays in the early universe is comparable to the hubble scale .",
    "we have relaxed this assumption and , by expanding on the formalism of @xcite , calculated the temperature fluctuations that arise from the inhomogeneous heating .",
    "the spectrum of fluctuations in @xmath12 is significantly larger than that predicted from uniform heating , peaking on scales @xmath283 .",
    "this allowed us to examine the redshift range about @xmath78 , where @xmath54 , and show that there is a window of width @xmath288 in which the igm will contain pockets of gas both hotter and colder than the cmb .",
    "this has implications for the 21 cm signal , which will be seen in a mixture of absorption and emission within this window .",
    "the best hope for observing the temperature evolution before reionization is through 21 cm observations of neutral hydrogen .",
    "systematic effects arising from foregrounds",
    "are likely to prevent interferometers from measuring @xmath186 directly @xcite , although several alternative methods for obtaining @xmath186 have been proposed @xcite . thus careful analysis of brightness fluctuations will be required to extract astrophysical information .",
    "fluctuations in @xmath12 lead to fluctuations in @xmath11 , which contain information about the thermal history and the nature of the heating sources . we have calculated the 21 cm power spectrum arising from inhomogeneous x - ray heating and shown that it has considerable structure . in the regime where gas temperature and ly@xmath3 flux fluctuations compete , we expect a trough - peak - trough structure in @xmath348 . once @xmath12 fluctuations dominate , but while @xmath69 , we see a peak - trough structure . as the gas heats , this structure is lost as the trough moves to unobservable small scales while the peak decreases and finally vanishes once @xmath87 . extracting astrophysical information cleanly will be challenging , but the information is there .",
    "it is important to notice that the difference between uniform and inhomogeneous heating is large .",
    "observations with the ska should be able to distinguish these two cases and indicate whether x - ray heating is important .",
    "if it is possible to perform an angular separation of @xmath361 , then observing @xmath297 is a clear indicator that @xmath69 .",
    "ideally , one would extract the quantity @xmath52 , but this requires fitting of other parameters and so is a less direct ( but more conclusive ) observational feature .",
    "additionally , the spectra of the x - ray sources imprint information on the @xmath12 fluctuations .",
    "this may be observed in the 21 cm power spectra , where it shifts the critical scale at which @xmath333 changes sign , or during the regime in which ly@xmath3 fluctuations dominate , where it modifies the shape of the power spectrum .",
    "the temperature fluctuations that we have calculated lead to a 21 cm signal that extends down to relatively low redshifts .",
    "this opens an opportunity for future 21 cm radio arrays to probe the thermal history prior to reionization .",
    "including temperature fluctuations makes the 21 cm signal significantly more complex , adding information , but further raises the question of how best to separate out that information .    in this paper",
    ", we have ignored the contribution from poisson fluctuations in the source distribution @xcite .",
    "while calculating it requires only a straightforward extension of the @xcite formalism , performing the time integrals necessary to convert heating fluctuations into temperature fluctuations is non - trivial .",
    "we have estimated the amplitude of these poisson temperature fluctuations and find them ( in our models ) to be subdominant at all redshifts .",
    "this is largely because there are many more sources at the lower redshifts where temperature fluctuations are important . in theory , high - precision 21 cm observations can separate these poisson fluctuations from fluctuations correlated with the density field .",
    "the poisson contribution could then be used to probe the distribution of sources , for example , by distinguishing between highly biased mini - quasars and less biased star - burst galaxies , producing the same global x - ray luminosity .    in our analysis",
    "we have taken @xmath150 , corresponding to normalising the x - ray luminosity per unit star formation to that observed in the local universe . in truth , this assumption is highly speculative and the value for @xmath149 is extremely uncertain .",
    "we have investigated the effects of changing @xmath149 and find that it alters the details of the thermal evolution significantly .",
    "taking @xmath341 , for example , shifts the point where 21 cm brightness fluctuations change from being dominated by ly@xmath3 fluctuations to gas temperature fluctuations from @xmath362 to @xmath198 .",
    "setting @xmath363 increases the redshift of this transition to @xmath364 .",
    "for values of @xmath365 , we find a clear separation between 21 cm brightness fluctuations sourced by gas temperature and ly@xmath3 fluctuations .",
    "increasing @xmath149 also increases the redshift at which @xmath366 , so that gas temperature fluctuations become irrelevant for the 21 cm signal .",
    "additionally , small values for @xmath149 will increase the contribution of other heating mechanisms such as shock heating .",
    "all of this suggests that measuring the time evolution of the 21 cm signal ( as in figure [ fig : fx ] for example ) would enable @xmath149 to be constrained .",
    "unfortunately , until these observations are made it is difficult to predict the thermal history before reionization with any certainty .",
    "we have shown that the 21 cm signal at high @xmath90 will contain significantly more structure than has previously been considered .",
    "temperature fluctuations produce an interesting interplay with other sources of 21 cm anisotropy as @xmath313 when @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , for reasonable heating scenarios , the effect of temperature fluctuations persist well into the regime that will be probed by second generation low - frequency arrays , such as the ska .",
    "thus , prospects for probing the thermal history before reionization via observations of the redshifted 21 cm line seem promising .    this work was supported at caltech in part by doe de - fg03 - 92-er40701 .",
