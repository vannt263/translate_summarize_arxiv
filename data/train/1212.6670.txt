    "for each twin - peak qpo model and each source , the consideration results in a specific relation between the ns mass @xmath0 and the angular - momentum @xmath1 rather than in their single preferred combination . we also observe some differences in the @xmath2 behaviour that represents a dichotomy between the high- and the low- frequency sources . in general ,",
    "the low - frequency sources data are matched by the models better than those of the high - frequency sources .",
    "based on the relativistic precession ( rp ) model introduced by @xcite , we demonstrate that this dichotomy is related to strong variability of the model predictive power across the frequency plane implied by the radial dependence of the characteristic frequencies of orbital motion . as a consequence ,",
    "restrictions on the models resulting from observations of the low - frequency sources are weaker than those in the case of the high - frequency sources .",
    "these findings are illustrated in figures  [ figure:1 ]  and  [ figure:2 ] .",
    "for a particular non - geodesic modification of the rp model that we consider in @xcite , the data of both classes of sources are well - matched ( see figure  [ figure:2 ] for illustration ) .",
