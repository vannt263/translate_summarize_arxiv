    "quasars rank among the most luminous objects in the universe and are believed to be powered by smbhs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they constrain the formation and evolution of galaxies and smbhs throughout cosmic time .",
    "the similarity between the cosmic star formation history ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the evolution of quasar abundances ( e.g. , @xcite ) suggests an intriguing link between galaxy formation and black hole growth .",
    "this is strengthened by tight correlations measured locally between the masses of the black holes and the global properties of the spheroid components of their hosts , such as their luminosities and masses ( @xcite ) , light concentration ( @xcite ) , and velocity dispersions ( @xcite ) .",
    "distant , highly luminous quasars are important cosmological probes for studying the first generation of galaxies , the star formation history and metal enrichment in the early universe , the growth of the first supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , the role of feedback from quasars and black holes in galaxy evolution , and the epoch of reionization . the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) has contributed significantly to the discovery of high redshift quasars .",
    "currently , there are over 1000 quasars known at @xmath11 and 12 at @xmath12 ( @xcite ) .",
    "as reviewed by @xcite , quasars at @xmath13 are characterized by : ( 1 ) a low space density ( @xmath14 comoving ) ; ( 2 ) high luminosities ( absolute luminosity at rest - frame @xmath15 ) , believed to be powered by smbhs of @xmath1 ; ( 3 ) gunn - peterson absorption troughs @xcite in their spectra , which place these quasars at the end of the epoch of reionization ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; and ( 4 ) a lack of evolution in the spectral energy distribution compared to lower - shift counterparts ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which demonstrates the existence of `` mature '' quasars at early times and comparable metal enrichment in quasars at all cosmic epochs .",
    "the most distant quasar known , sdss j1148 + 5251 ( hereafter j1148 + 5251 ) , was discovered by sdss at z = 6.42 @xcite .",
    "it is extremely bright optically with @xmath16 = -27.8 , and deep imaging surveys in both optical and radio ( @xcite ) show no sign of gravitational lensing or other companions at the same redshift in the vicinity . over the past few years",
    ", this quasar has been extensively studied at many wavelengths . near - infrared observations by @xcite and @xcite",
    "imply a bolometric luminosity of @xmath17 powered by accretion onto a smbh of mass 15 @xmath18 .",
    "radio observations by @xcite and @xcite suggest that the host is a hyper - luminous far - infrared ( fir ) galaxy , with @xmath19 , and these authors estimate a star formation rate of @xmath20 by assuming most of the fir luminosity comes from young stars .",
    "emission from carbon monoxide ( co ) has been detected ( @xcite ) corresponding to a mass of @xmath21 .",
    "dust has been seen by several groups ( e.g. , @xcite ) with an estimated mass of @xmath22 . in particular , _ spitzer _ observations by @xcite and @xcite indicate that the dust is heated by an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "furthermore , the detection of iron by @xcite , the carbon fine structure line [ cii ] by @xcite and excess oi absorption by @xcite indicate near - solar metallicity in the quasar host .",
    "these observations raise many fundamental questions for models of quasar and galaxy formation : where do such high - redshift , luminous quasars originate ? how do they form ?",
    "what are the mechanisms and physical conditions for smbh growth ? and",
    ", do these quasar hosts obey the same smbh ",
    "host correlations as observed in the local universe ?    interpretations of various observations of j1148 + 5251  have painted a rather conflicting picture for the formation site of the quasar halo and the smbh  host relationship .",
    "the low abundance of these quasars leads to the view that they are hosted by massive halos ( @xmath23 ) in the rarest density peaks of the dark matter distribution @xcite .",
    "however , it has been argued , based on the lack of companion galaxies in the field , that this quasar may reside in a much lower mass halo in a less overdense region ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite suggest , based on the dynamical mass estimate from co measurements , that j1148 + 5251contains a small stellar spheroid , and that the smbh may have largely formed before the host galaxy .",
    "however , the detection of metal lines ( @xcite ) , along with dust ( @xcite ) , indicates that the interstellar medium ( ism ) of j1148 + 5251  was significantly enriched by heavy elements produced through massive star formation at rates of @xmath24 occurring as early as @xmath25 , and that large stellar bulges form before accreting smbhs undergo luminous quasar activity .    in an expanding universe that is dominated by cold dark matter and is accelerated by dark energy , the @xmath2-cold dark matter ( @xmath2cdm )",
    "cosmology , the leading theoretical model for structure formation , assumes that structure grows from weak density fluctuations amplified by gravity , with small objects collapsing first and subsequently merging to form progressively more massive ones , a process known as `` hierarchical assembly '' ( e.g. , see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the formation of galaxies and quasars is therefore determined by the abundance of dark matter halos ; i.e. , the number density of halos as a function of mass and redshift .",
    "the most widely used analytic model for the halo mass function was first developed by @xcite ( hereafter ps ) , which is based on gaussian density perturbations , linear gravitational growth , and spherical collapse of dark matter . using the ps mass functions , @xcite studied the abundance of rare objects , such as luminous quasars at high redshifts .",
    "these authors predicted a sharp `` cut - off '' of the quasar population at @xmath26 .",
    "however , while the initial , linear growth of density perturbations can be calculated analytically , the gravitational collapse and subsequent hierarchical build - up of structure is a highly nonlinear process that can be followed only through numerical simulations .",
    "it has been shown by previous numerical studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and more recently by the state - of - the - art _ millennium simulation _ by @xcite , that the ps formula underestimates the abundance of high - mass halos by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , whether or not rare quasars such as j1148 + 5251  can form in the @xmath2cdm cosmology remains an open question and an important test of the theory .    to date",
    ", only a limited number of analytical or semi - analytic models have addressed the early formation of a @xmath27 smbh at @xmath0 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these approaches use merger trees of dark matter halos generated using the ps theory , and assume a black hole accretion rate at or above the eddington limit .",
    "however , as discussed above , the ps  based approach may be inaccurate .",
    "moreover , it is not clear whether sufficient physical conditions for such large accretion rates exist in quasar systems as the hydrodynamics of the large - scale gas flow and feedback from black holes have not been incorporated in earlier modeling .",
    "it is believed that the growth of smbhs is closely linked to galaxy formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and that the growth is self - regulated by feedback ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "remarkably , self - regulated models with smbh feedback in the form of thermal energy coupled to the ambient gas have been demonstrated to successfully reproduce many observations of galaxies , including the @xmath28 relation ( @xcite ) , galaxy colors ( @xcite ) , x - ray gas emission @xcite , elliptical kinematics @xcite and the fundamental plane @xcite , quasar properties ( @xcite ) , luminosity functions ( @xcite ) , and populations ( @xcite ) , and the luminosity function of low - level agn @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these simulations of binary mergers identify a plausible , merger - driven formation mechanism for massive black holes and luminous quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    here , we present a model that accounts for the smbh growth , quasar activity and host galaxy properties of the most distant quasar known . in our scenario ,",
    "the quasar and its host galaxy form in a massive halo that originates from a rare density peak in the standard @xmath2cdm paradigm , and they grow hierarchically through multiple gas - rich mergers , supporting an average star formation rate of @xmath24 that peaks at @xmath29 . once the progenitors undergo sufficient dynamical friction to coalesce , the multiple smbhs from the progenitor galaxies merge and exponentially increase their mass and feedback energy via accretion . at @xmath30 when the smbh mass exceeds @xmath31 , black hole accretion drives a sufficiently energetic wind to clear obscuring material from the central regions of the system and powers an optically luminous quasar similar to j1148 + 5251 . we have devised a set of novel multi - scale simulations , which include cosmological n - body calculations on large scales and hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy mergers on galactic scales , coupled with the self - regulated growth of smbhs , enabling us to follow galaxy assembly and quasar formation at @xmath0 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in   2 , we describe our computational methods and models , which includes a set of large scale cosmological n - body simulations , and hydrodynamical galaxy mergers along the merging history of the quasar halo . in   3 , we present the formation and evolution of the quasar and its host galaxy , including the assembly of the galaxy progenitors , star formation , and smbh growth , as well as the smbh  host correlations , and properties of the quasar such as luminosities and lifetimes . we discuss feedback from starburst - driven winds , quasar abundances for cosmological models with different parameters , the implication of black hole mergers , and galaxies in the epoch of reionization in   4 , and summarize in   5 .",
    "rare , high - redshift quasars originate in highly overdense regions in the initial dark matter density distribution and grow through hierarchical mergers , as predicted by the @xmath2cdm theory . simulations of high - redshift quasar formation must model a large cosmological volume to accommodate the low abundance of this population , have a large dynamic range to follow the hierarchical build - up of the quasar hosts , and include the hydrodynamics of the gas flows in galaxy mergers . the cutting - edge _ millennium simulation _ by @xcite follows structure formation in a box with side length of @xmath32 using @xmath33 dark matter particles .",
    "it reproduces the large - scale galaxy distribution as observed @xcite , and identifies an early quasar halo candidate at @xmath34 which ends up in the richest cluster at the present day .",
    "however , even such a large dynamic range still falls short of being able to follow the formation and evolution of the rarest quasars observed at the highest redshifts .",
    "moreover , in order to address the properties of quasars and host galaxies , gasdynamics and physical processes related to star formation and black hole growth must be included . to satisfy these requirements",
    ", we have performed a set of novel multi - scale simulations that enable us to resolve individual mergers on galactic scales and retain the context of large - scale structure formation , as well as the evolution of black holes and stars .",
    "first , we perform a coarse dark matter simulation in a volume of @xmath35 designed to accommodate the low number density of @xmath36 quasars . the largest halo at @xmath37 , within which the descendants of early , luminous quasars are assumed to reside @xcite ,",
    "is then selected for resimulation with higher resolution using a multi - grid zoom - in technique developed by @xcite .",
    "the merging history of the largest halo at @xmath0 , which has reached a mass of @xmath38 through 7 major ( mass ratio @xmath39 5:1 ) mergers between redshifts 14.4 and 6.5 , is extracted .",
    "these major mergers are again re - simulated hydrodynamically using galaxy models scaled appropriately for redshift @xcite and adjusted to account for mass accretion through minor mergers .",
    "the simulations include prescriptions for star formation @xcite , and for smbh growth and feedback ( @xcite ) , as described below .",
    "our multi - scale simulations were performed using the parallel , n - body / smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget2 developed by @xcite that is well tested in a wide range of applications from large scale structure formation to star formation . for the computation of gravitational forces , the code uses the `` treepm '' method @xcite that combines a `` tree '' algorithm @xcite for short - range forces and a fourier transform particle - mesh method @xcite for long - range forces .",
    "the pm - method works efficiently in large scale cosmological simulations , while the tree - method provides accurate forces for the large dynamic range of galaxy merger simulations .",
    "gadget2 implements the entropy - conserving formulation of sph @xcite with adaptive particle smoothing , as in @xcite .",
    "radiative cooling and heating processes are calculated assuming collisional ionization equilibrium @xcite .",
    "star formation is modeled in a multi - phase ism , with a rate that follows the schmidt - kennicutt law ( @xcite ) .",
    "feedback from supernovae is captured through a multi - phase model of the ism by an effective equation of state for star - forming gas @xcite .",
    "a prescription for supermassive black hole growth and feedback is also included , where black holes are represented by collisionless `` sink '' particles that interact gravitationally with other components and accrete gas from their surroundings .",
    "the accretion rate is estimated from the local gas density and sound speed using a spherical bondi - hoyle @xcite model that is limited by the eddington rate .",
    "feedback from black hole accretion is modeled as thermal energy injected into surrounding gas , as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper adopt the @xmath2cdm model with cosmological parameters chosen according to the first year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data ( wmap1 , @xcite ) , ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45)= ( 0.3 , 0.04 , 0.7 , 0.7 , 1 , 0.9 ) . here , @xmath40 is the total matter density in units of the critical density for closure , @xmath46 .",
    "similarly , @xmath41 and @xmath47 denote the densities of baryons and dark energy at the present day .",
    "the hubble constant is parameterized as @xmath48 , while @xmath45 is the root - mean - squared linear mass fluctuation within a sphere of radius @xmath49 extrapolated to @xmath37 .",
    "we have also done the same cosmological simulations with wmap third year results ( wmap3 , @xcite ) , ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45)= ( 0.236 , 0.042 , 0.759 , 0.732 , 0.95 , 0.74 ) for comparison .",
    "the quasars at @xmath0 have an extremely low comoving space density , @xmath50 , and are believed to reside in massive dark matter halos with @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "cosmological simulations of quasar formation must therefore model a volume of @xmath52 to account for the rarity of such objects .",
    "however , in order to resolve a @xmath53 halo at @xmath0 in a cosmological simulation with uniform resolution , a dark matter particle mass at least as small as @xmath54 and particle numbers of @xmath55 are required .",
    "tracking the merger history of such halos requires @xmath56 orders of magnitude higher resolution and would be computationally prohibitive with standard techniques .",
    "we achieve the mass resolution requirements for the merger history of a @xmath53 halo at @xmath57 by means of a two - step re - simulation .",
    "first , coarse dark matter cosmological simulations are performed to identify a candidate halo for the quasar host .",
    "a cubic volume @xmath58 on a side is simulated with @xmath59 particles , achieving mass and force resolutions of @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( comoving ) , respectively . to generate the initial conditions",
    ", we use the boltzmann code cmbfast by @xcite to compute a linear theory power spectrum for our chosen cosmology .",
    "a random realization of the power spectrum is constructed in fourier space , sampling modes in a sphere up to the nyquist frequency of the mesh .",
    "the particle distribution is evolved forward in time to @xmath37 from its initial displacement at @xmath62 determined using the zeldovich approximation .    at the end of the simulation",
    ", halos are identified using a `` friends - of - friends '' ( fof ) group - finding algorithm @xcite with a fixed comoving linking length equal to 0.2 times the mean dark matter interparticle separation and a minimum of 32 particles per group @xcite .",
    "the mean overdensity of the groups corresponds approximately to the expected density of virialized halos @xcite . from the more than 126000 groups identified in the @xmath63 volume at @xmath37 the largest halo with @xmath64",
    "is selected as a candidate halo for modeling the formation of a quasar at @xmath65 .    a multi - grid technique developed by @xcite and @xcite",
    "is used to `` zoom in '' with high resolution on the selected halo region which has an effective side length of @xmath66 .",
    "large - scale tidal forces are captured by binning exterior particles into cells according to their distance from the high - resolution region .",
    "to ensure proper treatment of small - scale structure , the initial displacements of the high resolution particles are calculated assuming a higher initial redshift of @xmath67 and normalized to @xmath45 at @xmath37 . the re - simulation uses @xmath68 particles , with @xmath69 particles inside the high - resolution region . with this technique ,",
    "the mass resolution increases by almost four orders of magnitude to @xmath70 while the spatial resolution reaches @xmath71 .",
    "figure  [ figmap ] shows snapshots of both the coarse and high - resolution zoom - in runs that locate the quasar halo candidate . in the coarse run ,",
    "the `` cosmic web '' is clearly seen , although the distribution appears nearly homogeneous on such large scales . in the zoom - in run ,",
    "filamentary structures are prominent .",
    "dark matter collapses along the filaments , and the largest halo forms in the deepest potential wells at the intersections of the filaments .",
    "the high resolution of the zoom - in run enables the identification of more halos with lower masses both at @xmath37 and at high redshifts as early as @xmath72 , which is sufficient to identify the halo progenitors of the candidate quasar at @xmath0 .",
    "it appears that the halo progenitor of the largest one at the present day is also the most massive halo at @xmath0 , when it reaches a mass of @xmath73 , making it a plausible candidate for hosting a rare @xmath74 quasar .",
    "the impact that variations in the cosmological parameters can have on large - scale structure formation can be understood from the theoretical mass function of halos , as derived by @xcite and later developed by @xcite .",
    "the comoving number density @xmath75 of halos of mass between @xmath76 and @xmath77 can be described as , @xmath78 \\ , , \\label{eq_mf}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the local mean mass density , @xmath80 is the critical density of collapse at redshift @xmath81 linearly extrapolated to the present day , and @xmath82 is the mass variance , which is a function of the power spectrum @xmath83 with wavenumber k and the window function @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "the abundance of halos depends on the two functions @xmath82 and @xmath86 , each of which involves the cosmological parameters , in particular @xmath45 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "these parameters determine the formation epoch of a halo and its mass .    the recently - released third year wmap3 results @xcite have lower values of @xmath45 , @xmath89 and @xmath87 , compared to wmap1 @xcite .",
    "the smaller @xmath45 from wmap3 would lower the amplitude of the power spectrum , which in turn reduces @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore , a smaller @xmath87 would reduce @xmath80 and hence delay halo formation .",
    "so , compared to wmap1 , at a given redshift the wmap3 parameters would yield a lower abundance of halos with mass @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the halo mass corresponding to the characteristic luminosity in the schechter luminosity function for galaxies @xcite ; while for @xmath92 , it predicts a slightly larger halo abundance .    to test the sensitivity of our model to the new wmap results",
    ", we have performed the same set of cosmological simulations with parameters from the wmap3 measurements @xcite .",
    "we find that indeed the changes implied by the new parameters primarily affect the formation time and the mass of the candidate quasar halo .",
    "for the same random phases in the initial conditions , the location of the most massive halo at @xmath37 remains the same in both the wmap1 and wmap3 runs , except that its mass is reduced by a factor of @xmath93 for the wmap3 parameters .",
    "similarly , the mass of the largest halo at @xmath94 is altered by roughly the same factor .",
    "other notable changes include : ( 1 ) the formation epoch of the first halo is shifted from @xmath95 in the wmap1 run to @xmath96 in the wmap3 run , and ( 2 ) the merging history of the largest halo at @xmath0 moves to lower redshifts in the wmap3 run , but the number of major mergers remains the same .",
    "figure  [ figmf ] shows the halo mass functions from different cosmological simulations .",
    "the ps mass function @xcite , as well as the one corrected to match numerical simulations by @xcite ( st ) , are also shown for comparison .",
    "one important feature in this figure is that the coarse runs agree well with the st mass function , but show a larger comoving density at the high mass end than that predicted by the ps theory .",
    "our results show that the ps formula underestimates the abundance of high - mass halos by nearly an order of magnitude at @xmath97 , and the discrepancy between the ps calculation and numerical simulations becomes larger at higher redshifts , confirming previous findings ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this may explain why previous models using the ps formula to study the abundance of luminous quasars , which presumably form in massive halos , under - predicted the number of bright quasars at @xmath98 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , these results also suggest that the commonly used analytical merger tree generated using the ps formula may not be suitable to study quasar formation at high redshifts .",
    "there are two clear `` shifts '' of the mass function caused by resolution and cosmological parameters .",
    "those from runs with higher resolution extend to higher redshifts , and at the same redshift , the wmap1 runs produce more massive halos than the wmap3 ones .",
    "as shown in figure  [ figmf ] , the coarse runs produce mass functions only up to @xmath99 owing to limited mass resolution , while the zoom - in runs can produce quite reasonable mass functions as early as @xmath100 . because the zoom - in runs were deliberately centered on the highest density peak of the @xmath35 box , they each contain a very massive halo ( @xmath101 at @xmath37 ) by construction .",
    "this explains why the highest mass bin ( which contains only one halo in this case ) is @xmath56 orders of magnitude larger than the theoretical curves ( st , ps ) , which apply only to a _",
    "random _ region that has a much lower density fluctuation .    to summarize , at a given redshift , runs with the wmap3 parameters yield slightly less massive halos than ones performed with the wmap1 values . or , to put it differently , objects in the wmap3 cosmology will have masses similar to those for wmap1 , but at slightly later times ( i.e. lower redshifts ) . in",
    "what follows , we are primarily concerned with investigating the plausibility of forming @xmath57 quasars through the self - regulated growth of smbhs in hierarchical mergers , rather than precisely reproducing the properties of an individual quasar at a given redshift , such as j1148 + 5251 .",
    "most of our results are therefore based on runs with the wmap1 parameters , to ease comparison with previous numerical work . if it were firmly established that e.g. @xmath45 is in reality smaller than its wmap1 value , then a more exact match to a particular quasar could presumably be obtained by considering larger simulation volumes and identifying a suitable candidate host that is slightly rarer than the one we have chosen to focus on here .",
    "traced by mergers at different redshifts with mass ratio @xmath102 , which is defined as the mass ratio between the halo and progenitor at a given time .",
    "each of the progenitors joins in this big merging event at a given redshift , interacts with the system , and subsequently merges with others at later times .",
    "the quasar host at @xmath0 is built up by seven successive major mergers of progenitors g1 , g2 , ...",
    "g8 from @xmath96 to @xmath103 , as illustrated by the red lines in this plot .",
    "the first interaction between g1 and g2 takes place at @xmath96 , then g3 and g4 join in the system at @xmath104 , followed by g5 , g6 , g7 and g8 at later times ( see text for more details ) .",
    "the timeline of these events , the mass and other properties of these progenitors are listed in table  1.,width=336 ]    to follow the hierarchical mass assembly of the host galaxy over cosmic time , the merger tree of the halo is extracted from the cosmological simulation .",
    "this tree provides key information for computing the physical properties of the progenitor galaxy population . while the merger history of the halo includes a spectrum of progenitor masses , the most massive progenitors contribute the majority of the halo mass over the redshift range considered .",
    "we trace the merger history of the most massive progenitor at each redshift by using particle tags to identify progenitor systems at earlier redshifts in the simulation .",
    "groups that contribute at least 10% of the halo mass at a given time step are considered as the progenitors of the halo and are recorded .",
    "the procedure is repeated until the last progenitor is reached , producing the merging history .",
    "figure  [ figtree ] illustrates the merging history of the largest halo at @xmath37 in our cosmological simulation , which has a mass of @xmath105 .",
    "it is also the largest one at @xmath106 with a mass of @xmath107 .",
    "this schematic plot outlines the redshift of merger event , and the mass ratio of the halo to its galaxy progenitors at a given time .",
    "it shows that this halo grows rapidly through hierarchical mergers early on , with seven major mergers ( mass ratio of the merging pairs @xmath108 ) from @xmath96 to @xmath109 that build up a substantial fraction of the halo mass at @xmath0 .    in modeling the development of a @xmath57 quasar",
    ", we are primarily interested in `` major '' mergers , where the mass ratio of the merging galaxies is not too far from unity , for several reasons .",
    "first , it is believed that major mergers play the most important role in the formation and evolution of massive galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "second , and of greater concern to us in this paper , in our picture for quasar fueling , gas in a rotationally supported disk loses angular momentum through gravitational torques excited by tidal forces in a merger , driving the growth of supermassive black holes .",
    "this process operates most effectively in a major merger because the tidal deformation of each galaxy is significant in such an event @xcite .",
    "collisions involving galaxies with a mass ratio as large as @xmath110 can induce gas inflows in disks @xcite , but only for limited orbital configurations .",
    "for these reasons , we focus on mergers from the merger tree having a mass ratio @xmath108 , as outlined by the red color in figure  [ figtree ] .    in the resimulation of the merger tree as described in   [ sec_mt ] , we take into account mass accretion of the halo by adding mass proportionally to each of the eight progenitor galaxies in the major mergers .",
    "this approach preserves the progenitor mass ratios and approximately preserves the dynamics of the major mergers @xcite .",

    "a comparison of the total stellar mass and total black hole mass is shown in figure  [ figmas ] . at early time , both the stars and black holes grow rapidly through galaxy mergers . shortly after the peak quasar phase",
    ", strong feedback suppresses both the accretion and star formation , the masses of the black holes and stars become saturated gradually , and in the end satisfy @xmath259 , similar to the correlation measured in nearby galaxies ( @xcite ) .",

    "we note , however , that the velocity dispersion of the stars in the remnant center is about @xmath260 ( after the system relaxes ) owing to the deep potential well of the merger system , so the @xmath28 relation falls below the correlation observed locally ( @xcite ) .",
    "single mergers of progenitor galaxies constructed in a redshift range of z=06 by @xcite appear to follow the observed @xmath28 correlation with a weak redshift dependence of the normalization , which results from an increasing velocity dispersion of the progenitors at higher redshift .",
    "the multiple mergers we derive from cosmological simulations take place at much higher redshifts and hence the progenitors have larger velocity dispersions , implying a larger deviation from the local @xmath28 relation than in the work of @xcite .",
    "however , because we do not follow subsequent mergers and accretion into the host halo below @xmath57 , the implications of this result for the evolution of the @xmath28 relation are unclear .",
    "observations of active galaxies have yielded ambiguous results about the smbh  spheroid relationship .",
    "for example , @xcite report a lower zero - point of the @xmath28 of local active galaxies than that of the inactive sample @xcite ; at @xmath261 , @xcite found the same @xmath28 relation in the redshift range @xmath26213 , while others ( e.g. , @xcite ) show correlations with various offsets .",
    "in particular , @xcite estimate a dynamical mass of @xmath263 using the co linewidth measured in j1148 + 5251 , and suggest that the bulge is under - massive by at least one order of magnitude compared to the local @xmath10 relation .",
    "however , the co calculation by @xcite finds that the co linewidth of the quasar in our simulation is larger than the mean 280 km s@xmath264 measured by @xcite and @xcite by almost an order of magnitude , and that the derived dynamical mass is @xmath265 , putting the simulated quasar on the @xmath10 correlation .",
    "@xcite further suggest that the observed emission line may be sitting on top of a much broader line , which may be tested by future observations with large bandwidths .",
    "the different relations reported from the observations may reflect a divergence of the methods used to estimate the black hole mass and stellar properties , or may represent different evolutionary stages of the systems @xcite .",
    "more observations and better measurements of black hole mass and properties of host bulges will be crucial to study the smbh  host relations in high - redshift quasar systems @xcite and to test our hypothesis .",
    ".,width=336 ]    both the bolometric and attenuated luminosities of the quasar and the host galaxy in the simulations can be readily calculated following the methodology of @xcite .",
    "the bolometric luminosity @xmath266 of stars is calculated using the stellar population synthesis model of @xcite , while that of a black hole is calculated as @xmath267 , where @xmath268 is the radiative efficiency , @xmath269 is the black hole accretion rate , and @xmath270 is the speed of light . in this calculation ,",
    "the black holes are assumed to be non - rotating .",

    "we first calculate the line - of - sight column - density of the gas from each source to a distant observer . for each black hole",
    "we generate 1000 radial sight lines originating at the black hole particle location and uniformly spaced in the @xmath271 solid angle @xmath272 , while for the stars , an accurate estimate of the luminosity is possible with only one sight line per source owing to the extended distribution . along each ray",

    ", we do not include a full treatment of radiative transfer , and therefore do not model scattering or re - processing of radiation by dust in the infrared .",
    "however , for the b - band luminosity , results using a 3-d monte carlo radiative transfer code are close to those calculated using the methods we present here @xcite .    figure  [ figlum ] shows both the bolometric and attenuated b - band luminosities of the quasar , compared with observations of j1148 + 5251 .",
    "the system is intrinsically bright with a total luminosity @xmath283 , and the host appears as an ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) with @xmath284 for most of the time . at high redshifts , @xmath285",
    ", starlight dominates the total luminosity . however , black holes take over at a later time .",
    "the quasar light - curve increases dramatically , peaking at @xmath30 , when it is powered by the most massive black hole accreting at near the eddington rate .",
    "the estimated @xmath266 of j1148 + 5251  differs from that of the simulated quasar by less than the uncertainty in the luminosity estimate .",

    "however , we should emphasize that in this paper , our main goal is to investigate the plausibility of forming luminous @xmath13 quasars through hierarchical mergers , rather than precisely reproducing the properties of an individual quasar such as j1148 + 5251 , so the disagreement shown in figure  [ figlum ] should not be taken too literally .",
    "moreover , the _ exact _ luminosity can change by a factor of several from relatively trivial or random details in the simulations .",
    "if the black hole spin is taken into account , then the simulated luminosities would increase by a factor of up to 4 , which would match the observation of j1148 + 5251  better .",
    "feedback - driven outflows create un - obscured lines - of - sight , allowing the growing central smbh to be visible as an optically - bright quasar between redshifts @xmath288 and @xmath74 . at the peak of the quasar activity , more than 50% of the 1000 sight lines have @xmath289 .",
    "the absorbed light is re - emitted at infrared wavelengths by dust .",
    "we find that the luminosity in the far infrared @xcite is close to @xmath290 estimated for j1148 + 5251  by @xcite .",
    "moreover , we find that up to 80% of the fir light comes from the black hole , while stars contribute only @xmath291 .",
    "this may explain why the star formation rate at @xmath292 during the peak quasar phase is an order of magnitude lower than the estimate from fir observations @xcite , which will be contaminated by the agn .",
    "another prominent feature of figure  [ figlum ] is a clear phase transition from starburst to quasar .",
    "it has long been suggested that ulirgs are powered by starbursts in galaxy mergers ( for reviews , see @xcite ) , and that bright quasars are the descendants of ulirgs ( @xcite ) .",
    "this conjecture has been supported by observations of quasar hosts ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and theoretical modeling @xcite . in @xcite , we calculate the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the quasar system and its galaxy progenitors . we find that the seds of the system at @xmath285 are characterized by those of starburst galaxies @xcite , while at the peak quasar phase , the seds resemble those observed in @xmath0 quasars @xcite .",
    "we also find that the system evolves from cold to warm ulirg as it transforms from starburst to quasar phase .",
    "our results provide further theoretical evidence for the ulirg ",
    "quasar connection in quasar systems in the early universe .",
    "the quasar lifetimes depend on the observed luminosity threshold , as proposed by @xcite . in our simulation , at the peak luminosity of @xmath293 , the quasar lifetime is roughly @xmath294 yrs , as shown in figure  [ figtq ] . again",
    ", if black hole spin is included in the calculation , the luminosity of the quasar would increase by a factor of several , and the quasar lifetime would be longer .",
    "however , when increasing the radiative efficiency , the salpeter time ( @xmath295-folding time for eddington - limited black hole growth , @xcite ) is increased by an identical factor , meaning it would also require a longer time to reach the same mass .",
    "if high - redshift quasars are rapidly rotating , then , our calculations demand that either the seeds be _ much _ more massive at @xmath12 , or that they accrete in a super - eddington manner . in other words",
    ", if the observed sloan quasars at @xmath0 shine with eddington luminosity but are rotating rapidly , then our model suggests that their masses would be considerably smaller than estimated .",
    "we note that recent _ spitzer _ observations by @xcite show that 2 out of 13 quasars at @xmath57 have a remarkably low nir - to - optical flux ratio compared to other quasars at different redshifts , and these authors suggest that the two quasars may have different dust properties . according to our model ,",
    "however , these two outliers may be young quasars that have just experienced their first major starburst but have not yet reached peak quasar activity , so the light from star formation may be dominant , or comparable to that from the accreting smbh still buried in dense gas .",
    "this may explain the low nir flux , as well as the b - band luminosity and the narrow @xmath296 emission line , which are primarily produced by the starburst .",
    "we will address this question further in a future paper with detailed modeling and ir calculations @xcite .",
    "our multi - scale simulations that include large - scale cosmological n - body calculations and hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy mergers , as well as a self - regulated model for black hole growth , have successfully produced a luminous quasar at @xmath3 with a black hole mass of @xmath297 and a number of properties similar to those of j1148 + 5251 , the most distant quasar detected at @xmath298 @xcite .",
    "our approach differs from previous semi - analytic studies by @xcite and @xcite in the following ways :    1 .",
    "we use a realistic merger tree derived directly from multi - scale , high - resolution cosmological simulations .",
    "the previous studies used merger trees of dark matter halos generated with the extended press - schechter theory @xcite , which may underestimate the abundance of high - mass halos by up to one order of magnitude , as shown in   [ subsec_mf ] . also , the merger trees in those studies started from much higher redshifts than what we consider here . in our model ,",
    "the quasar halo is the largest one in a volume of @xmath299 .",
    "it has a mass of @xmath300 at @xmath301 built up through seven major mergers from @xmath244 to @xmath302 .",
    "we follow the evolution of the system and treat the gas dynamics , star formation , and black hole growth properly .",
    "this approach is critical to investigation of the properties of both black holes and host galaxies , and their evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but it was not included in those previous studies on formation of @xmath0 quasars .",
    "we employ a self - regulated model for the growth of supermassive black holes , in which the accretion is regulated by the black hole feedback , and the rate is under the eddington limit . in the previous studies ,",
    "the black hole growth was unregulated , but instead a constant- or super - eddington accretion rate was used .",
    "4 .   in our simulations",
    ", we do not consider black hole ejection caused by gravitational recoil owing to insufficient resolution and lack of relativistic physics .",
    "however , the halo escape velocities in our simulations are in the range of @xmath303 ",
    "@xmath304 , much larger than the kick velocity @xmath170  @xmath253 ( e.g. , @xcite , see   [ subsec_vesc ] and   [ subsec_bhgrowth ] for more details ) .",
    "therefore , black hole ejection may be negligible in our case .",
    "previous studies had much smaller halo progenitors at higher redshifts than ours , so the black hole seeds would be more likely subject to ejection from their halos .",
    "this leads to the conclusion in these studies that constant or super - eddington accretion is needed owing to significant black hole ejection .",
    "our results are robust within the best estimates currently available for the recoil velocity of the black hole binary .",
    "the black hole seeds in the galaxy progenitors in our simulations are massive ( e.g. , @xmath163 at @xmath305 ) .",
    "the sub - resolution recipe in our model does not allow us to resolve the actual formation and accretion of such black holes below this mass scale .",
    "the formation of these seeds is an unsolved problem , but our results do not depend on the specific prescription of the formation process .",
    "we adopt a picture in which the seed holes come from the remnants of the first stars ( which have a mass @xmath160 at @xmath306 ) and grow under eddington limit until they enter the merger tree we simulated .",
    "if the growth is delayed by radiation feedback from the popiii stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , then super - eddington accretion , or other proposed scenarios ( e.g. , @xcite ) may be necessary to form massive seeds of @xmath307 in the protogalaxies .",
    "overall , we conclude that the results from our simulations , which are more realistic and more detailed than the models previously done , are robust .",
    "suppermassive black holes of @xmath1 can form rapidly through gas - rich hierarchical mergers under eddington limit , even within a short period of time .",
    "we find that constant or super - eddington accretion is not necessary unless the above assumptions in our modeling break , i.e. , there are no massive black hole seeds of @xmath308 available at @xmath309 , or the recoil velocity of the coalescing black hole binary is extremely high ( e.g. , @xmath310 ) . under these extreme circumstances ,",
    "some `` exotic '' processes such as super - eddington accretion may be necessary to grow a @xmath1 smbh within a few hundred million years .",
    "however , we should note , as pointed out by @xcite , that most gas - rich galaxy mergers have a configuration such that the orbit and spins of both black holes are aligned with the large - scale gas flow owing to torques from accreting gas .",
    "such a configuration has a maximum kick velocity @xmath255 , which is well below the escape velocity of a @xmath311 dwarf galaxy , as well as those of the halos in our modeling .      during the galaxy mergers ,",
    "the black holes follow their host halos to the system center and can form binaries ( or multiple systems ) .",
    "the coalescence of a black hole binary includes three distinct phases : inspiral , merger , and ringdown ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "whether black hole binaries can coalesce on short timescales is a matter of debate . in a stellar environment",
    ", it has been argued that a binary hardens very slowly owing to an eventual depletion of stars that cause the binary to lose angular momentum ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in a gaseous environment , however , numerical simulations by @xcite and @xcite show that the binaries decay rapidly owing to strong dynamical friction with the gas , and they likely merge within @xmath312 years . because our galaxies are very gas rich and have large central concentrations of gas during the mergers , we assume the black hole particles coalesce once their separation decreases below our spatial resolution ( @xmath313 ) and their relative speed falls below the local gas sound speed @xcite .    in the simulations",
    ", we do not have sufficient resolution nor the relativistic physics to consider the ejection of black holes by gravitational recoil during the merger phase .",
    "however , as discussed in ",
    "[ subsec_vesc ] and   [ subsec_bhgrowth ] , the halo escape velocities in our simulations are much larger than the maximum kick velocity for black hole binary estimated from the latest relativistic calculations .",
    "so black hole ejection is likely unimportant in our modeling . to accurately address gravitational recoil in the galaxy merger simulations , we need to include general relativity , resolve the dynamics of black hole binaries with extremely high resolution , and calculate the halo potential in a cosmological context ( in which halo potential distribution may be different from that of a single object ) .",
    "however , such a comprehensive treatment is impossible at the moment .",
    "we therefore assume the black holes merge quickly once they reach the stage of gravitational radiation .",
    "these coalescing supermassive black holes will be strong sources of gravitational radiation detectable by the laser interferometer space antenna ( _ lisa _ , @xcite ) , as suggested by many authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) . by tracing the merging history of the smbhs ,",
    "_ lisa _ could shed light on the distribution , structures and evolution of the associated dark matter halos .",
    "because luminous , high - redshift quasars are likely sites of vigorous hierarchical mergers , they may be the best targets for _ lisa _ to explore the early universe .      ) , and the specifications of the wind model is : wind efficiency @xmath314 , wind energy coefficient @xmath315 , wind free travel length @xmath316 , and a wind velocity @xmath317.,width=336 ]    vigorous star formation would induce a galactic wind and mass outflow , a phenomenon that has been observed to prevail in both local star - forming galaxies as indicated by blueshifted optical absorption lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and lyman break galaxies at @xmath318 as indicated by blueshifted interstellar absorption lines and redshifted ly@xmath113 emission lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as ly@xmath113 emitters at @xmath319 @xcite .",
    "these galactic winds are generally thought to play a significant role in galaxy evolution ( e.g. , see @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the strong starburst preceding the major quasar phase in our simulations may drive strong galactic winds and affect the black hole growth . to investigate the impact of the feedback from a starburst - driven wind on the growth of the black hole , we have done the same merger simulation with lower resolution ( @xmath320 ) and with a canonical wind model from @xcite : the wind efficiency @xmath314 , which measures the coefficient of the star formation that determines the mass outflow ; the energy fraction from supernovae injected into the wind @xmath315 , wind free travel length @xmath316 , and a wind velocity @xmath321 . as demonstrated by @xcite ,",
    "this wind model is able to reproduce the starbursts as observed in lyman break galaxies , and therefore is suitable to our study .",
    "we find that the impact of the starburst - driven wind on the quasar evolution is minor , as shown in figure  [ figwind ] .",
    "both the histories of star formation and black hole growth remain roughly the same as in the simulation without a starburst wind , only the amplitude is lowered by a factor of @xmath200 .",
    "similarly , the final masses of the black hole and the stars are reduced by roughly the same factor , but the quasar host is still on the @xmath10 correlation .",
    "the peak quasar phase is delayed to @xmath0 .",
    "overall , the starburst wind affects the gas dynamics locally , but owing to the deep potential of the system , its impact on the process of quasar formation is minor .",
    "our results support the finding by @xcite that feedback from starburst - driven winds alone is ineffective at regulating the growth of the central black hole , so feedback from the black hole plays the dominant role in the formation and evolution of quasars .       from the zoom - in simulations with parameters from both wmap1 ( solid line ) and wmap3 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the volume of the high - resolution zoom - in region is @xmath322.,width=336 ]    because we have so far simulated only one quasar in a volume of @xmath323 , we are not yet able to constrain the expected abundance of quasars @xmath57 .",
    "as mentioned in   2.3 , at a given redshift , cosmological simulations with parameters from wmap1",
    "produce more massive halos than runs with wmap3 owing to a larger value of @xmath45 .",
    "figure  [ fignum ] shows the number of halos at @xmath57 from the zoom - in runs with parameters from both wmap1 and wmap3 .",
    "there are about three dozen halos with mass @xmath324 in the wmap1 run , while in the wmap3 run there are only a handful of such halos .",
    "however , since in our picture the quasar activity depends not only on the halo mass , but also on the merging history , an accurate estimate of the quasar abundance and luminosity function would require hydrodynamical simulations of all the quasar candidates in a large box , which are currently unavailable . nevertheless , all conditions being equal , the change from the wmap3 parameters would produce fewer luminous quasars at @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that in a wmap3 cosmology , the quasar observed with the largest redshift , j1148 + 5251 , might have formed in a slightly higher overdensity peak than that we have presented here . in that event , if the wmap3 determination of @xmath45 were correct , we would need to identify a rarer density fluctuation to match j1148 + 5251  at its observed redshift .",
    "however , this does not change our conclusion that the most distant and luminous quasars can form from hierarchical galaxy mergers in the @xmath2cdm cosmology .",
    "imaging surveys of j1148 + 5251  show that there is no other luminous quasar from the same epoch in the field ( @xcite ) . in our simulations , around the peak of quasar activity at @xmath292 , there are no other halos of mass @xmath325 within a few mpc of this quasar .",
    "however , the numerous major mergers this halo experienced prior to the peak quasar activity demonstrates that this region was once highly clustered with massive halos , but they merged to become a bigger one by @xmath326 .    as seen from figure  [ figtree ] , this quasar halo will undergo a handful of major mergers at a later time from @xmath327  41 , and eventually end up as a cd - like galaxy at the center of a rich cluster . since we do not follow hydrodynamically the evolution of the quasar at @xmath328 , the physical conditions of these mergers remain undetermined .",
    "it is not clear whether this halo would experience more episodes of starburst or quasar activity later on during these mergers .",
    "therefore , the final black hole mass and other properties of this quasar at the present day are deferred to future simulations that follow its evolution to @xmath37 .",
    "the epoch of reionization ( eor ) is an important landmark event in cosmic history that constrains the formation of the first luminous objects @xcite .",
    "the recent results of wmap3 indicate that the universe was 50% reionized at @xmath329 @xcite , while studies of gunn - peterson absorption @xcite suggest that reionization began as early as @xmath305 and ended at @xmath0 @xcite . at present",
    ", it is believed that the reionization sources are star - forming galaxies since there are insufficient quasars at @xmath330 as indicated by the steep quasar luminosity function @xcite .",
    "the galaxy progenitors of the quasar in our simulations underwent extreme and prolonged starbursts before @xmath3 .",
    "less extreme galaxies in this epoch may also have vigorous star formation histories . detecting these galaxies and determining their contribution to reionization will be crucial to understanding the eor ( @xcite ) .",

    "the low luminosity density of galaxies currently detected at @xmath333 seems insufficient to reionize the universe .",
    "however , ongoing surveys with the hst and spitzer telescopes , and future missions such as the _ dark ages z ly@xmath113 explorer _ ( dazle , @xcite ) and the _ james webb space telescope _ ( jwst , @xcite ) will search deeper and further for high - redshift objects , and may eventually unveil ionizing sources in the eor .",
    "we have presented a model that accounts for the smbh growth , quasar activity and host galaxy properties of the most distant quasar observed at @xmath334 , by following the hierarchical assembly of the quasar halo in the standard @xmath2cdm cosmology .",

    "we first perform a coarse n - body simulation in a volume of @xmath35 to identify the largest halo at @xmath37 , which is assumed to be the descendant of the earliest luminous quasar .",
    "we then `` zoom in '' on the halo and resimulate the region with higher resolution sufficient to extract its merging history starting from very high redshift .",

    "<S> the discovery of luminous quasars at redshift @xmath0 indicates the presence of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) of mass @xmath1 when the universe was less than one billion years old . </S>",
    "<S> this finding presents several challenges for theoretical models , because whether such massive objects can form so early in the @xmath2-cold dark matter ( @xmath2cdm ) cosmology , the leading theory for cosmic structure formation , is an open question . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , whether the formation process requires exotic physics such as super - eddington accretion remains undecided . here , we present the first multi - scale simulations that , together with a self - regulated model for the smbh growth , produce a luminous quasar at @xmath3 in the @xmath2cdm paradigm . </S>",
    "<S> we follow the hierarchical assembly history of the most massive halo in a @xmath4 volume , and find that this halo of @xmath5 forming at @xmath3 after several major mergers is able to reproduce a number of observed properties of sdss j1148 + 5251 , the most distant quasar detected at @xmath6 @xcite . moreover , the smbhs grow through gas accretion below the eddington limit in a self - regulated manner owing to feedback . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the progenitors experience vigorous star formation ( up to @xmath7 ) preceding the major quasar phase such that the stellar mass of the quasar host reaches @xmath8 at @xmath9 , consistent with observations of significant metal enrichment in sdss j1148 + 5251 . </S>",
    "<S> the merger remnant thus obeys similar @xmath10 scaling relation observed locally as a consequence of coeval growth and evolution of the smbh and its host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide a viable formation mechanism for @xmath0 quasars in the standard @xmath2cdm cosmology , and demonstrate a common , merger - driven origin for the rarest quasars and the fundamental @xmath10 correlation in a hierarchical universe . </S>"
