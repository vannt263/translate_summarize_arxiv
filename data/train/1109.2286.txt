    "ferromagnetic films have been investigated in a variety of systems due to their wide range of applications @xcite and fundamental theoretical interests @xcite .",
    "applications such as inductors , transformers and other magnetic devices require the magnetic films with high cut - off frequency and high permeability @xcite . and ,",
    "the thin magnetic films with in - plane uniaxial anisotropy is essential to achieve better high frequency properties in realizing the target of increasing the static permeability and the resonance frequency simultaneously @xcite . as is well known , an in - plane uniaxial anisotropy can be obtained with oblique incidence of the vapor deposition beams @xcite , and an easy direction of magnetization can also be established parallel to the magnetic field applied during the deposition @xcite or during magnetic annealing of the specimens @xcite .",
    "the uniaxial anisotropy can also be obtained by other means such as sputtering @xcite , electro - deposition @xcite , etc . among these methods ,",
    "electro - deposition is an important cost - effective method for preparing pure nanocrystalline metal and alloy films .",
    "the characteristics of the induced magnetic anisotropy have been studied comprehensively in the 1960s ( for a review , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the anisotropy constant , @xmath1 , is strongly dependent upon the film composition and deposition conditions .",
    "different mechanisms have also been proposed mainly considering the anisotropy of atomic pair ordering @xcite , the strain anisotropy @xcite resulting from the constraint of the magnetostriction strain imposed on the film by the substrate and the shape anisotropy @xcite .",
    "recently , jin han - min et al reported a combination model @xcite of pair - strain - shape anisotropy to explain major characteristics of experiments in a broad range reasonably .",
    "but none of these models can explain all the experimental data and describe the origin of the anisotropy satisfactorily .    for electro - deposited films ,",
    "the anisotropy derived from directional ordering of atomic pairs have been mostly considered @xcite",
    ". however , direct experimental evidence for directional ordering of atomic pairs is not yet reported , and prevents clear understanding of the origin of the field induced uniaxial anisotropy . in the present work , using electro - deposition method , we prepared @xmath0 alloy film with an in - plane uniaxial anisotropy by applying an external magnetic field during deposition and , film deposited without external magnetic field for comparison .",
    "the films are studied by mssbauer spectroscopy in three geometric arrangements in order to probe the configuration of the magnetic moments in the film from a more microscopic scale .",
    "the @xmath0 alloy films were electro - deposited from the bath containing @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , and l - ascorbic acid ( @xmath7 ) at the current density of @xmath8 , and the temperature of the bath was kept at room temperature .",
    "the magnetic field applied parallel to the film plane during deposition is @xmath9 .",
    "the morphology and composition for both films were investigated by scanning electron microscopy ( hitachis-4800 , japan ) with energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( sem / eds ) .",
    "magnetic properties of the films were measured by a vibrating sample magnetometer ( lake shore 7304 , usa ) ( vsm ) .",
    "@xmath10 conversion electron mssbauer spectra ( cems ) of the samples were recorded by a conventional mssbauer spectrometer ( wissel , germany ) working in constant acceleration mode at room temperature .",
    "the @xmath11-ray source of the mssbauer spectrometer is 25mci @xmath12 in palladium matrix .",
    "@xmath13-fe was used to calibrate the isomer shifts and the driver velocity .",
    "fig . [ sem ] shows the sem images for film a deposited without the applied external magnetic field and film b deposited with the external magnetic field .",
    "it can be seen that the films are composed with small grains , and the surface of film b is much smoother , which means that the grains are smaller and composed much denser for film b than film a. but , no macroscopic structure such as nonspherical grains responsible for uniaxial anisotropy was observed .",
    "this is consistent with the result reported by fujita n et al @xcite in their electro - deposited @xmath14 films , and suggesting that the anisotropy should be attributed to other origins of a more microscopic scale such as short - range atomic pair ordering @xcite .",
    "cross - sectional images obtained from sem revealed that the thickness for both film a and film b are about @xmath15 .",
    "eds analysis shows that the composition is @xmath16 for both film a and film b , and this is the very good composition to attain the largest uniaxial magnetic anisotropy constant @xmath1 @xcite in electro - deposited @xmath0 alloy films .",
    "sem images for film ( a ) deposited without external field and ( b ) deposited with external field .. ,width=8 ]    fig .",
    "[ vsm ] shows the typical in - plane hysteresis loops of the film deposited in the absence of external magnetic field ( a ) and the film deposited in the presence of external magnetic field of @xmath17 ( b ) . here",
    ", `` @xmath18 '' and `` @xmath19 '' denotes that the measurement field is parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the applied external magnetic field during deposition respectively .",
    "it can be seen clearly from the inset figure in the right - lower corner of ( a ) and ( b ) that the film deposited without external field exhibits isotropy while a distinct uniaxial anisotropy is established in the film deposited with applied external field , with its easy direction being parallel to the applied field direction during deposition .",
    "the anisotropy field , @xmath20 , obtained from the vsm result is about @xmath21 .",
    "typical in - plane hysteresis loops for film a and b at room temperature .",
    "`` @xmath18 '' and `` @xmath19 '' denotes that the measurement field is parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the applied external magnetic field during deposition respectively.,width=8 ]    in order to study the anisotropy deeply from a microscopic scale , cems of the @xmath0 alloy films were recorded at room temperature in three geometric arrangements to probe the configuration of the magnetic moments in the film .",
    "the cems of the alloy films are shown in fig .",
    "as can be seen , the spectra are broad sextets because different iron sites coexist due to random substitution of solid solution @xcite , and therefore were fitted with the hyperfine field distribution of a slightly modified version of the hesse and rubartsch method using the mosswinn programme @xcite .",
    "spectrum a and spectrum b were measured with the @xmath11-ray beam perpendicular to the film plane for film a and film b respectively .",
    "spectrum b - e60 and spectrum b - h60 were also measured for film b , but with the @xmath11-ray beam forming an angle of @xmath22 with the easy direction ( while perpendicular to the hard direction ) and the hard direction ( while perpendicular to the easy direction ) respectively .",
    "the fitted parameters are given in table [ tablemoss ] .",
    "the hyperfine field and isomer shift observed for both film a and film b are in agreement with those reported by sorescu m et al @xcite and cohen n s et al @xcite . but the hyperfine field of film b is slightly smaller than that of film a , this may be caused by the differences of grain size and density of the two films .    as is well known , using the mssbauer effect",
    ", the polar angle @xmath23 can be calculated from the relative intensities of the hyperfine splitting of the mssbauer lines .",
    "the relation between @xmath23 and the relative intensities of @xmath10 lines are given by @xcite @xmath24 where ( @xmath25 ) corresponds to ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the polar angle @xmath23 calculated by equation ( [ ratio ] ) from the value x in table [ tablemoss ] are also listed .",
    "the polar angle @xmath23 for film a(@xmath27 ) is much smaller than the value for film b(@xmath28 ) , which could be attributed to the rough surface of film a , indicating that the applied magnetic field tends to align the magnetic moments in the film plane .",
    "if the magnetic moments were spatially isotropic in the film plane , no differences of the polar angle should be observed between b - e60 and b - h60 .",
    "however , in our experiments the @xmath23 obtained for b - e60(@xmath29 ) is much smaller than that for b - h60(@xmath30 ) , suggesting that the magnetic moments of film b are anisotropic in the film plane and tend to align in the direction of the easy direction of the film .",
    "this means that the magnetic moments of film b have a directional ordering in the film plane , and the ordering direction is parallel to the external magnetic field applied during deposition .",
    "de oliveira l s et al @xcite have studied both external and internal surface side of the electro - deposited films that detached from the substrate , and no significant difference was observed .",
    "so , we may neglect the effect of substrate on the formation of the uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "k. tanahashi and m. maeda @xcite have reported that the observed value of the uniaxial anisotropy constant @xmath1 of their electro - deposited @xmath0 alloy films are considerably larger than that obtained for the vacuum evaporated @xmath0 alloy films , and by comparing the theoretical dependence of @xmath1 , the average internal stress @xmath31 and @xmath32 on the film composition with the experimental data , they concluded that the observed anisotropy seems to depend mainly on the atomic ordering . and ,",
    "as there was no macroscopic structure such as nonspherical grains giving rise to shape anisotropy was observed from the sem image , we suggest that the observed anisotropy in our sample should also be attributed to directional ordering of atomic pairs @xcite , a microscopic phenomenon proposed by nel .",
    "mssbauer spectra taken at room temperature with the @xmath11-rays perpendicular to the film plane for ( a ) and",
    "( b ) , and with the @xmath11-rays forming an angle of @xmath22 with the easy direction ( while perpendicular to the hard direction ) of film b for ( b - e60 ) and hard direction ( while perpendicular to the easy direction ) of film b for ( b - h60).,width=8 ]    as is shown above , our electro - deposited @xmath0 alloy films have a distinct in - plane uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "this is a perpetual requirement for magnetic films in high - frequency applications @xcite .",
    "it is well known that for thin magnetic films with in - plane anisotropy , the natural resonance frequency can be calculated by the following equation @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath11 is the gyro magnetic constant , @xmath34 is the saturation magnetization and @xmath20 is the in - plane anisotropy field . if we take the parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 and use the anisotropic field @xmath37 , we can obtain the resonance frequency of @xmath38 which is in good agreement with the measured data of @xmath39 .",
    "detail experimental results and model for the complex permeability of the film will be reported soon .",
    ".mssbauer parameters for @xmath0 alloy films .",
    "@xmath40 is the isomer shift relative to @xmath13-fe , @xmath41 is the hyperfine field , @xmath42 is the line width of the spectrum , x denotes the intensity ratio of @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath23 is the polar angle calculated from equation ( [ ratio ] ) . [",

    "in summary , @xmath0 alloy film with a distinct in - plane uniaxial anisotropy has been prepared by the simple electro - deposition method . and the film is a good candidate for high frequency applications .",
    "the uniaxial anisotropy was studied by means of vibrating sample magnetometer and conversion electron mssbauer spectroscopy .",
    "vsm results show that the film deposited with an magnetic field applied parallel to the film plane during deposition has an easy direction coincides with that of the magnetic field , while the film deposited without external magnetic field does nt show any easy direction in the film plane .",
    "mssbauer spectra taken with the @xmath11-ray beam perpendicular to the film plane , show that the magnetic moments are almost constrained in the plane for the film deposited with external magnetic field .",
    "the spectra taken with the @xmath11-ray beam forming an angle of @xmath22 with the easy direction ( while perpendicular to the hard direction ) and hard direction ( while perpendicular to the easy direction ) of the film give different polar angles , indicating that the anisotropy of the film depend mainly on the directional ordering of atomic pairs .",
