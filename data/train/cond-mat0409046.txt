    "readout of a computational result often requires detection of charge motion on fast timescales  not only to ensure fast processing speeds , but also to perform a readout operation before the information is lost due to interaction with the environment or relaxation . towards this goal ,",
    "the suitability of radio - frequency single - electron transistors ( rf - sets ) as fast and sensitive charge detectors has been demonstrated.@xcite    recently double - island sets ( disets ) have been proposed for readout of qca and qubits.@xcite with such applications in mind , brenner _",

    "in particular , both types of detection can be achieved in the same device , simply by using different biasing regimes : keeping the diset at a high transconductance or at a conductance peak ( with zero transconductance ) , respectively .",
    "this versatility alone makes diset detectors an interesting alternative to conventional set detectors .    in this article",
    "we report work on a radio - frequency diset ( rf - diset ) , including a measurement of its charge sensitivity and the demonstration of single - shot measurements on @xmath3 timescales .",
    "operation at radio - frequencies increases the sensitivity of charge detectors as @xmath4-type noise becomes negligible ( i.e. less than the detector noise ) and also facilitates the study of processes that have short decay or relaxation times , such as qubits .",
    "we also present an intuitive model for calculating the charge sensitivity of a diset , and we find that under certain conditions the charge sensitivity of a diset is superior to that of a set .",
