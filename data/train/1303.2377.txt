    "cavity - optomechanics deals with the interaction of an optical field in a resonator with confining mirrors  @xcite .",
    "recent experimental advances make it possible to couple cold atoms and bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) , mechanical membrane and nano - sphere with the optomechanical systems @xcite .",
    "hence , these hybrid - opto mechanical systems are playground to study phenomena related to mirror - field interaction , and atom - field interaction which provide founding principles to develop numerous sensors , and devices in quantum metrology . in opto - mechanics the mechanical effects of light lead to cool the motion of a movable mirror to its quantum mechanical ground state @xcite , and to observe strong coupling effects  @xcite . in earlier work optomechanical systems",
    "were suggested to develop gravitational wave detectors  @xcite and to measure displacement with large accuracy  @xcite , and in recent research work these systems lead to develop optomechanical crystals  @xcite .",

    ", we discuss the dynamical localization of ultra - cold atoms or dilute bec trapped inside a single mode driven optomechanical cavity with one fixed mirror and the other as a movable mirror .",
    "dynamical localization is an interesting phenomenon in periodically driven nonlinear systems @xcite and provides quantum mechanical limits on classical diffusion of wave packet .",
    "we show that for different modulation regimes the dynamical localization is observed both in position and in momentum space .",
    "the phenomenon of dynamical localization emerges as the hybrid optomechanical system is explicitly time dependent , hence , the single mode laser field provides spatially periodic potential to bec with phase modulation@xcite due to modulated end mirror .    in the paper , the model of the system",
    "is presented in section  [ sec : model ] . in section  [ sec : langevin ] we derive the langevin equation and in section  [ sec : numdl ] , we explain dynamical localization of the condensates in the system . in section  [ sec :",

    "last term gives relation of intra - cavity field and output power @xmath19 , where , @xmath20 is the input laser power and @xmath21 is cavity decay rate associated with outgoing modes .    now",
    "the hamiltonian for bec and intra - cavity field and their coupling is derived by considering quantized motion of atoms along the cavity axis in one dimensional model .",

    "the coupled equations of motion which govern the dynamics of the moving end - mirror and the bec are quantum langevin equations  ( [ 2 ] ) . in adiabatic approximation we consider no thermal excitation , for the reason , we ignore noises and radiation effects resulting from optical damping  @xcite . therefore , in short time limit we ignore the mechanical damping , as a result the coupled equations of motion for the moving end - mirror and bec reveal their coupled nonlinear oscillator dynamics , that is , @xmath61 the corresponding effective hamiltonian is described as @xmath62 , where , @xmath63 , here , @xmath64 is dimensionless planck s constant .",

    "moving end mirror of cavity should be perfect reflector that oscillates with a frequency @xmath88 .",
    "the mirror - field and condensate - field coupling strengths are , respectively , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "detuning of the system is taken as @xmath91 , where vacuum rabi frequency of the system is @xmath92 and number of ultra cold atoms placed in the bec - optomechanical system are @xmath93  @xcite .",
    "the quantum dynamics of dilute bec is explored by evolving a gaussian material wave packet , @xmath94 , defined at @xmath95 with , @xmath96 as its initial dispersion in the position space and @xmath97 corresponding to its initial dispersion in the momentum space .",
    "dynamics of the condensate is shown in fig-[b ] . here",
    ", fig-[b](a ) shows classical and quantum dispersion in momentum space as a function of time .",
    "initially , the classical and quantum dispersion in momentum space follows the classical diffusion law but after quantum break time , quantum dispersion of the material wave packet saturates and oscillates around a mean value while , classical dispersion increases continuously with time , following @xmath98 law , where @xmath99 showing anomalous diffusion in classical domain .",
    "similarly , from fig-[b](b ) , we note that quantum dispersion in position space saturates after quantum break time and fluctuates around average value while , classical dispersion in position space that shows anomalous diffusion as well .    here , fig.-[b](d , e ) show classical and quantum time averaged probability distributions of bec both in momentum and in position coordinates , respectively , for modulation amplitude @xmath100 .",
    "we calculate probabilities in momentum coordinate @xmath101 and position coordinate @xmath102 after an evolution time @xmath103 . from the numerical results , we observe that the classical probability distribution in momentum and in position space are broader than their quantum mechanical counterpart . in contrast",
    "quantum mechanical probability distributions are maximum at the points where the matter wave was initially placed and as we traverse the regions away from the initial mean values the probability of finding the matter wave both in momentum and in position space decreases .",
    "the mixed phase space with chaotic and regular regions appear due to the presence of modulated end - mirror that modifies the evolution of the condensate in effective nonlinear potential seen by the condensate in the cavity , as shown in fig-[b](f ) .",
    "as probability distributions are marginal distributions of phase space , in quantum mechanical probability distributions the peak positions both in momentum and in position coordinates correspond to the underlying nonlinear resonances in the poincare surface of section .",
    "maximum fraction of the condensate is trapped with momentum in the range @xmath104 to @xmath105 and in the position space @xmath106 to @xmath107 because of regular regions in this domain as shown in fig-[b](f ) . in momentum distribution ,",
    "peak at @xmath108 corresponds to the regular region at same momentum value .",
    "similarly , in position space distribution peaks at @xmath109 and @xmath110 corresponds to the regular regions appearing in phase space .    the part of the wave packet which is not in regular region experiences exponential decay which indicates that the probability of finding the condensate decreases exponentially in the regions away from the classical resonances .",
    "maximum probability of finding the condensate is near the primary resonance as it originates initially from there .",
    "the exponential decay of distribution is one of the fundamental evidence of dynamical localization .",
    "fig-[b](c ) shows mean quantum mechanical energy @xmath111 of the condensate as a function of time for @xmath100 .",
    "the mean energy of the condensate shows very small fluctuation around a constant value and shows quantum recurrences as a function of time .",
    "the consequence of dynamical localization in position and momentum space becomes prominent as we study the spatio - temporal dynamics of the condensate , presented in fig-[fig : distvstime ] .",
    "we show space - time dynamics in momentum space both in quantum mechanical and classical space , respectively , in fig .",
    "[ fig : distvstime](a ) and [ fig : distvstime](b ) . whereas , we plot space - time dynamics in position space both quantum mechanically and classically , respectively , in fig .",
    "[ fig : distvstime](c ) and [ fig : distvstime](d ) .",
    "as the time evolves classical distributions both in momentum space and in position space melt down and spread over the entire available space with maximum probability in the resonances .",
    "on the other hand , quantum mechanical probability distributions in momentum space and in position space initially follow classical behavior , however , beyond quantum break time localization limits the spread .",
    "the maximum probability of finding the material wave packet stays around the nonlinear resonances .",
    "the material wave packet tunnels to other resonances which provide the exponential decay as shown in fig .",
    "[ b](d , e ) , therefore probability of finding the condensate in neighboring resonances increases with time .    .",
    "the remaining parameters are same as in fig-[b].,width=340 ]",
    "we numerically study the classical dispersion and quantum dispersion of the condensate both in momentum space fig-[e](a ) and in position space fig-[e](b ) as a function of modulation strength for a fixed time . for a small value of modulation",
    "classical and quantum dispersions deviate slightly both in position and in momentum space .",
    "as we increase the modulation in the system , momentum and position dispersions show contrasting behavior in classical and in quantum mechanical domain . in classical dynamics dispersion both in position space and in momentum space increases while , quantum dispersion displays saturation .",
    "the quantum dispersion manifests periodic oscillations in momentum space and in position space . at the minima of these oscillations we observe strong localization at particular modulation values where the difference between classical dispersion and quantum mechanical dispersion is maximum . as the value of rescaled planck s constant ,",
    "@xmath112 reduces , the time evolution of the quantum dispersion both in position and momentum space approaches to classical dispersion and periodic oscillation in the quantum mechanical dispersion vanish as well , hence , the periodic behavior is strictly quantum phenomena which may display quantum revivals in dynamical systems .    .",
    "the other parameters are same as in fig .",
    "[ b].,width=321 ]",
    "in this contribution we study the dynamics of a condensed atoms in an opto - mechanical system where it is coupled to the moving end mirror through the cavity field and displays dynamically localization both in position and momentum space .",
    "a contrast between classical and quantum dynamics is the evidence of the existence of dynamical localization and its presence is the signature of quantum chaos in a dynamical system .",
    "this behavior is different from the dynamical localization of ultra - cold atoms in modulated optical field where localization is observed only in momentum space @xcite .",
    "spatio - temporal dynamics of condensate in position and momentum space confirm our finding as well .",
    "we have also calculated the dispersion in position and momentum space as a function of modulation for fixed time.the dynamical localization phenomenon is realizable experimentally in position and in momentum space by using presently available experimental parameters .",
