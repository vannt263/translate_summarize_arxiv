    "magnetic reconnection is the mechanism that allows topological change in weakly resistive magnetic plasmas such as the solar corona . for reconnection to be effective , huge currents involving steep field gradients must be present .",
    "how these near - singular current structures develop is not fully understood , but it is generally recognised that topological features of the field  null points and separators  should play a decisive role @xcite . more physically , these features are likely to provide sites for the quiescent heating of the corona and the rapid energy release in solar flares @xcite .    one route to understanding reconnection is to examine the eigenstructure of 3d magnetic nulls .",
    "this provides a field skeleton that comprises `` spine '' lines and `` fan '' planes which accumulate current when the null is suitably perturbed .",
    "for instance , bending the spine of an isolated x - point , leads to a current layer aligned to the fan i.e. `` fan '' reconnection ( for a review on topological aspects in reconnection see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , a different current structure emerges when the fan plane is distorted : this leads to `` spine '' reconnection in which quasi - cylindrical tubes of current become localized to the spine axis @xcite .",
    "current sheet formation and reconnection can also take place in the absence of a null .",
    "the key feature in this case is the `` quasi - separatrix layer '' or qsl for short @xcite .",
    "this is a region of rapid variation in field - line connectivity which can be thought of as being of geometrical @xcite rather than topological significance .",
    "the simplest example is provided by a line - tied planar x - point threaded by uniform axial field .",
    "the qsl extends between the upper and lower planes @xmath0 ( say ) and replaces the separatrix surfaces of the purely planar x - point .",
    "all points on the qsl are connected alfvnically , but there is no unique point , like a magnetic null , on which currents can accumulate @xcite .",
    "there is observational evidence that current formation and reconnection involving coronal active region outflows are connected to qsls @xcite .",
    "models of solar flares @xcite and coronal mass ejections also suggest that qsls can play a decisive role in the initiation of such eruptions @xcite .",
    "more theoretically , since qsls provide strong layers of currents , they must be regarded as prime sites for particle acceleration in the active corona ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    how qsls influence reconnection is not entirely clear .",
    "opinion is divided on whether disturbances which include shifts of the line - tied boundary can initiate a collapse to an ideal current singularity  as they do in null point reconnection  or whether very steep but finite current distributions are obtained @xcite .",
    "what is known , at least for magnetic x - points , is that by strengthening the effects of axial line - tying , either by increasing the axial field or shortening the distance between the upper and lower line - tied boundaries , current localization can be inhibited @xcite .",
    "this leads to the strongest current accumulation around the outer boundaries of the x - point , which is unfavourable to rapid reconnection and artificial in terms of a computational reconnection experiment .    in order to prescribe an initial field",
    "in which qsl structures or magnetic nulls are present , a potential field generated by submerged magnetic monopoles is often considered .",
    "studies of these magnetic structures , driven by slow lower - boundary photospheric motions , show strong currents developing along the qsl with no signs of saturation in the accessible numerical resolution regime @xcite .",
    "the strong gradients due to the monopoles which are situated closely below the lower boundary can , however , present numerical difficulties that may result , artificially , in the largest currents forming close to that boundary .",
    "the aim of the present study is to compare qsl current structures with those in isolated magnetic nulls .",
    "in contrast to previous studies based on the submerged monopole approach , we use line - tied analytically prescribed fields that allow for a continuous transformation between null - point and qsl equilibria .",
    "this allows null point and qsl currents to be treated on the same physical footing . in ",
    "[ sec : fields ] we discuss the form of the general force - free equilibrium field we employ as the basis of our study and detail how perturbations can lead to current formation . in  [ sec : comp ] we will present results from relaxation runs performed with both a linearized , potential version of this field , and the more general force - free field .",
    "we finally discuss our findings in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we consider an equilibrium field @xmath1 defined within the interior of the rectangular domain @xmath2 and line - tied on all the bounding surfaces .",
    "this field is subject to some finite amplitude disturbance that displaces the footpoints of the equilibrium field altering the magnetic topology .",
    "magnetic reconnection allows the perturbed field to `` relax '' dynamically into a new equilibrium which is topologically different from the initial disturbed field .",
    "however , if resistive effects are absent but some other form of damping is present , the perturbed field has to relax without topological change . in this case , a near - singular configuration can emerge , comprising strong , highly localized current densities .",
    "it is the properties and definition of these near - singular `` relaxed '' fields that are the focus of the present study .",
    "our starting point is an initial field @xmath1 with the components @xmath3 we assume that field intensities and distances are scaled according to typical coronal values , for example @xmath4  g for the magnetic field and @xmath5  cm for the coronal size scale .",
    "the domain @xmath6 is then the region @xmath7 .",
    "the initial field is defined by the three parameters , @xmath8 and @xmath9 and has the following properties : @xmath10 we see that @xmath11 accounts for a rotation phase , while @xmath12 allows for rotational asymetries about the @xmath13-axis in the field .",
    "the null is located at the point @xmath14 and , for fixed @xmath15 , can be shifted outside the field domain by adjusting @xmath9 .",
    "the field , being force - free , is considerably more general than potential fields due to the presence of parallel currents .",
    "potential fields can be extracted from the general field ( [ eq : b ] ) by formally regarding @xmath11 and @xmath9 as sufficiently small parameters .",
    "we then obtain the linear potential field @xmath16 we can avoid redundant parametrization by taking @xmath17 : @xmath18 in this case we should regard @xmath11 as a proxy for the isotropy parameter .",
    "note that , although the potential forms allow considerable simplification , they can be expected to provide a reasonable guide to the current accumulation properties of the more general field ( [ eq : b ] ) at least in regions close to the null .",
    "this point is revisited in  [ sec : comp ] below .      in our analysis",
    ", we consider only perturbing fields @xmath19 that disturb the lateral boundaries of the domain . to illustrate the effect of these disturbances , consider the simple form @xmath20 in the superposition @xmath21 provided that @xmath22 or @xmath23 are non - zero",
    ", the perturbation is finite on the boundary points @xmath24 .",
    "the field line equations @xmath25 in the case of a null point field give ( assuming @xmath26 ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are constants .",
    "the separatrices are defined by field lines that thread the null , i.e. by setting @xmath30 .",
    "we obtain the `` fan '' plane @xmath31 and the `` spine '' line @xmath32 we see that the spine line of the unperturbed field ",
    "the @xmath33-axis in the case @xmath34  becomes tilted due to the perturbation .",
    "this generates currents of magnitude @xmath35 within the fan .",
    "when no resistivity is present , these initial currents localize  and eventually blow up  in the vicinity of the null point .",
    "the fan - spine structure breaks down when the null point is absent . in the simplest case of a planar field with no axial component ( @xmath36 ) the separatrices ( obtained by the first of eqs .",
    "[ eq : fieldeq ] ) are just the two planes @xmath31 and @xmath37 , the latter being tilted through the angle @xmath38 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the null point is now extended to a null line defined by the intersection of the two planes .    in the case of a constant finite axial field ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 )",
    "the null line is removed and separatrices can not be defined .",
    "even so , each @xmath13-plane still retains a projected copy of the tilted separatrix planes of the perturbed planar x - point .",
    "reconnection again requires currents localized towards the @xmath13-axis but now involves field lines whose ends are anchored across different @xmath13-planes .",
    "line - tying the axial field on @xmath41 , however , breaks the symmetry @xmath42 and makes the geometry fully three - dimensional .",
    "this is the topology of the qsl : no null is present but magnetic stresses can accumulate due to steep field gradients centred on the @xmath13-axis .    finally , we turn to the field line equations in the case @xmath43 , that is , the simplest case of a qsl field ( i.e. @xmath44 ) , without a null : @xmath45 we see that there is strong exponential dependency on the @xmath46 field line even when the perturbation amplitude vanishes ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "this dependency reflects the geometrical squashing factors associated with equilibrium field lines when no null is present @xcite .      as a complement to the computational study of  [ sec : comp ] , it is instructive to determine qsl squashing factors for the case where @xmath23 vanishes but @xmath22 remains finite . in this case we regard the upper and lower boundaries as adjustable planes @xmath48 ( say ) and use the field line equations ( [ eq : fieldeqnull ] ) to relate the upper and lower footpoint locations . denoting the footpoint coordinates at the upper and lower boundaries with @xmath49 and @xmath50 we have that @xmath51",
    "these expressions can be used to determine the invariant squashing factor @xmath52 along the tube axis as defined in @xcite .",
    "we find that @xmath53 for modest perturbation amplitudes ( i.e.  @xmath54 ) the squashing factor is determined mainly by the form of the equilbrium field : specifically @xmath52 increases rapidly with the tube length ( @xmath55 ) but decreases with the strength of the axial field .",
    "given these properties it seems natural to suppose that current accumulation in the qsl might reflect this behaviour .",
    "there is some numerical evidence that longer tubes can lead to stronger current localizations along the tube axis @xcite but , to our knowledge , a direct link between qsl currents and squashing factors has not yet been established .",
    "the previous discussion suggests that reconnection can be expected within qsl configurations in response to foot - point displacements of the lateral boundaries , like those given by equation  ( [ eq : apert ] ) .",
    "what is less certain is the strength and location of the reconnection currents within the qsl .",
    "one possibility is that , in addition to the form and amplitude of the foot - point displacements , current strengths may be moderated by geometric squashing factors @xcite associated with the equilibrium configuration .",
    "more specifically , given that the present computational setup reflects the disturbed field @xmath56 of section  [ sec : spine - fan - qsl ] , we expect to see steep field gradients aligned to the @xmath13-axis of the domain .    to investigate further , we now compare the current structures of perturbed magnetic field equilibria , both in the presence and in the absence of a null point .",
    "we use the magneto - frictional lagrangian scheme of @xcite which models line - tying by fixing fluid elements on the boundary of the domain @xmath6 . in practice",
    "we adopt a uniform distribution of @xmath57 fluid particles in the interior of @xmath6 and follow their evolution according to the lorentz forces on the plasma .",
    "the code is implicit and unconditionally stable .",
    "the solenoidal condition @xmath58 is satisfied to machine accuracy and flux and magnetic helicity are conserved .",
    "gas pressure forces are neglected in the runs that follow .",

    "the perturbation vanishes on all boundary points except @xmath24 .",
    "note that because the frictional relaxation can lead to divergent current structures the computed values of certain local variables may be sensitive to numerical resolution .",
    "this makes it possible to obtain scaling laws in which the maximum current density in the domain @xmath6 can be systematically quantified as a function of the resolution , i.e. the linear number @xmath61 of fluid particles in the domain .      ,",

    "the pseudo time parameter @xmath63 is based on uniform time increments and reflects the number of iterations in the relaxation . in practice the perturbation amplitude is chosen so that the initial forces and currents are of order unity ( @xmath68 in the present runs ) and the computation is halted when forces are reduced by four orders of magnitude .",
    "this protocol allows well defined scaling laws of the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are constants and @xmath72 is the final maximum current density in the domain .",
    "detailed scaling laws are discussed in section  [ sec : scaling ] below .",
    "returning to figure  [ fig : psedotime ] , it is clear that higher resolution runs are associated with higher relaxed current densities .",
    "furthermore , an even higher transitory current peak is visible in both cases .",
    "we do not investigate this phenomenon further in this study , since we are interested mainly in the near - singular , relaxed state .",
    "it seems worth remarking , however , that _ resistive _ relaxation in a full mhd configuration often involves inertial overshoots that lead to oscillatory null - point reconnection ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the blue isosurface confirms the simultaneous formation of currents along the qsl with a magnitude similar to the fan and spine currents .",
    "but now with @xmath81 , i.e. no null present in the domain .",

    "the currents are now considerably weaker than the peak current at the null of the previous setup .",
    "since there is no preferred location along the qsl , the currents are more evenly distributed , which can be expected , however , not only from the absence of a null , but also from the increased strength of the line - tied axial field which tends to resist current localisation .       against @xmath9 for four different resolutions : @xmath83 ( black , diamond ) ,",

    "this illustrates the variation of the relaxed maximum current density for a sequence of axial field strengths , specifically @xmath94 to @xmath95 in increments of @xmath96 . since @xmath97 the null is buried below the lower surface of @xmath6 for the two runs where @xmath98 .",
    "we see a strong scaling with resolution close to @xmath99 for the cases where the null is actually in the domain , with @xmath88 being the marginal case . for the qsl only current formation , we only find a weak but still significant scaling of @xmath100 .",
    "the question of what scaling should be expected for the peak current density with resolution is a key issue , given that `` fast '' reconnection , i.e. reconnection independent of the weak coronal plasma resistivity , is thought to be required in solar flares .",
    "in fact the @xmath72 versus @xmath61 scalings of the previous section can not , by themselves , provide reconnection rates .",
    "they can , however , be interpreted in the light of fast reconnection models . in this case , the strong @xmath101 scaling can be shown to be consistent with reconnection models in which the current sheet thickness scales linearly with the plasma resistivity @xcite .",

    "these values were chosen to give a close as possible configuration to the linear field studies presented above .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , the current again accumulates at the null , which is present at the same position as before , i.e. @xmath77 . the field structure around the null is also very similar , as should be expected from the linearization .",
    "the qsl currents , however , seem to be suppressed and overshadowed by the initial currents of the unperturbed field . despite these differences",
    ", the field structure still shows the strong qsl field - line connectivity gradient .",
    "exploratory computations with different resolutions indicate that the current magnitude at the null grows , as previously found in the linear field case , and reproduces a scaling @xmath107 which is again consistent with fast reconnection .",
    "the analysis of current structure and formation is , however , complicated due to the currents already present in the initial force - free configuration .",
    "we can see nonetheless that our linearized potential field model derived from the more complex force - free field can describe the structures and current build - up close to the null with high accuracy .",
    "we have investigated current formation in bounded line - tied magnetic field configurations using an ideal magneto - frictional relaxation method .",
    "our initial fields include potential fields that derive from a general force - free field configuration .",
    "this approach allows us to distinguish _ a priori _ between fields that contain a magnetic null in the computational domain @xmath6 and those which comprise only a strong qsl structure .    for parameter sets that comprise a magnetic null",
    ", we find that , although the strongest currents are always attracted to the null , significant current layers can still form along the superimposed qsl structure .",
    "the qsl currents , however , are more strongly pronounced in the simpler , linear potential field than in the considerably more complicated structures of our general force - free field .",
    "the current formation along the qsls becomes increasingly prominent for runs in which the null is positioned below the lower surface of the computational domain . for our range of parameters ,",
    "the currents appear to spread evenly over the qsl .",
    "we believe this absence of focusing is due to a lack of an additional structure in the qsl at least in the fields we examine .",
    "this contrasts to e.g. the hyperbolic flux tubes in some of the submerged monopole models @xcite .",
    "it would be of some interest therefore to extend our investigation to similar monopole field configurations .",
    "this requires a careful study of the initial conditions in the relaxation since the strong gradients at the boundary overlying the monopoles can prevent reconnective currents from localizing convincingly in the interior of the domain .",
    "one advantage of the present relaxation scheme is that we can follow current formation in a strictly `` ideal '' ( i.e. resistivity - free ) fashion .",
    "this allows one to compute scaling laws for the current divergence against resolution .",
    "in particular , we have seen that when the null is centred in the computational domain , scalings can be derived @xmath108 that are consistent with fast reconnection .",
    "the downside of this approach is that , having no access to the actual dynamic evolution towards the relaxed state .",
    "we can not draw any definite conclusions on the time - dependence of the current build up .",
    "thus , dynamic effects like alignment between the velocity and magnetic field @xcite that may come into play in the full mhd problem are not represented .",
    "we intend to investigate these and other dynamic effects further in the future , by comparing results from the relaxation method as employed in this study with three - dimensional ideal mhd calculations ."
