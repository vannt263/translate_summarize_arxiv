    "the increasing number of available data on heavy meson processes demands theoretical predictions for these processes to be compared with experiment .",
    "i consider a simple model , based on an effective constituent quark - meson lagrangian containing both light and heavy degrees of freedom , constrained by the known symmetries of qcd in the limit @xmath0 and the light chiral symmetry relations .",
    "i write a lagrangian at the meson - quark level @xcite .",
    "this allows to deduce from a small number of parameters the heavy meson couplings and form factors , with a considerable reduction in the number of free parameters with respect to the lagrangian written in terms of meson fields only @xcite .",
    "the part of the quark - meson effective lagrangian involving heavy and light quarks and heavy mesons is : @xmath1 + \\frac{1}{2 g_4 } { \\mathrm { tr } } [ { \\bar t}_\\mu t^\\mu ] \\label{qh1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the effective heavy quark field , @xmath3 is the light quark field , @xmath4 , @xmath5 are coupling constants and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 gev ) is a dimensional parameter .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ qh1 ] ) is heavy spin and flavour symmetric .",
    "note that the fields @xmath8 and @xmath9 have the same coupling constant . by putting these two coupling constants equal",
    ", one assumes that the effective quark - meson lagrangian can be obtained from a four quark interaction of the njl type @xcite .",
    "the cut - off prescription is part of the dynamical information regarding qcd which is introduced in the model .",
    "the idea is to mimic the qcd behaviour in a simple and calculable way . in",
    "the infrared the model is not confining and its range of validity can not be extended below energies of the order of @xmath10 . in practice",
    "one introduces an infrared cut - off @xmath11 , to take this into account .",
    "models related to the one discussed here , with different regularization prescriptions and different approaches are @xcite .",
    "the cut - off prescription used here is implemented via a proper time regularization .",
    "after continuation to the euclidean it reads , for the light quark propagator : @xmath12 where @xmath11 and @xmath13 are infrared and ultraviolet cut - offs .",
    "the cut - off prescription is similar to the one used in @xcite , with @xmath14 gev ; the numerical results are not strongly dependent on the value of @xmath13 .",
    "the constituent mass @xmath15 in the njl models represents the order parameter discriminating between the phases of broken and unbroken chiral symmetry and can be fixed by solving a gap equation , which gives @xmath15 as a function of the scale mass @xmath11 for given values of the other parameters . here",
    "i take @xmath16 mev and @xmath17 mev .",
    "as an example of the quantities that can be analytically calculated in the model , one can examine the isgur - wise function @xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 contains logarithmic corrections depending on @xmath22 ; within the approximations used here , it can be put equal to 1 . at leading order @xmath23 .",
    "the same universal function @xmath18 also parameterizes @xmath24 semileptonic decay .",
    "one finds : @xmath25 ~~.\\label{xi}\\ ] ] where : @xmath26\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in these equations @xmath27 is the generalized incomplete gamma function , erf is the error function and @xmath28 one can compute in a similar way the form factors describing the semi - leptonic decays of a meson belonging to the fundamental negative parity multiplet @xmath8 into the positive parity mesons in the @xmath9 and @xmath29 multiplets @xcite .",
    "examples of these decays are @xmath30 where @xmath31 can be either a @xmath9 state or a @xmath29 state .",
    "these decays are described by two form factors @xmath32 @xcite which can be computed in the model by a loop calculation similar to the one used to obtain @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the numerical results for the form factors are in table [ tab:3tab ] .",
    ".form factors and slopes .",
    "@xmath34 in gev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the predictions for a few branching ratios calculated in the model are given in table [ tab : sl ] .",

    "the model allows to compute the @xmath35 semileptonic decay form factor to @xmath36 , @xmath37 , etc .",
    "the form factors of @xmath35 to a vector meson @xmath38 consist of two kind of contributions . in the first one the current",
    "is directly attached to the loop of quarks . in the second , there is a intermediate state between the current and the @xmath39 system @xcite . for @xmath40 form factors an extra contribution",
    "is also taken into account @xcite .",
    "results are in good agreement with available data . for @xmath41",
    "( using @xmath42 , @xmath43 s ) : @xmath44 for @xmath45 : @xmath46 for @xmath47 : @xmath48    in the limit of heavy mass for the initial meson and of large energy for the final one ( leet ) , the expressions of the form factors simplify and for @xmath49 , they reduce only to two independent functions @xcite .",
    "the four - momentum of the heavy meson is written as @xmath50 in terms of the mass and the velocity of the heavy meson .",
    "the four - momentum of the light vector meson is written as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the energy of the light meson and @xmath53 is a four - vector defined by @xmath54 .",
    "the relation between @xmath55 and @xmath56 is : @xmath57 the large energy limit is defined as : _ qcd , m_v < < m_h , e keeping @xmath58 and @xmath53 fixed and @xmath59 is the mass of the light vector meson .",
    "the relations between the form factors appearing in the leet limit constitute a powerful theoretical cross  check of the formulas derived in the model .",
    "the result is as follows : a_0(q^2)&=&(1-)_||(m_h , e ) + _ ( m_h , e ) [ fatta0 ] + a_1(q^2)&=&_(m_h , e ) [ fatta ] + a_2(q^2)&=&(1 + ) + v(q^2)&=&(1+)_(m_h , e ) .",

    "( m_h , e)= ~ , [ zetaperp ] where terms proportional to the constituent light quark mass @xmath15 have been neglected .",
    "it is interesting to note that in leet one can also relate the tensor form factor @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 to the semileptonic ones and to the @xmath61 and @xmath60 form factors of the leet limit @xcite : @xmath65 @xmath61 and @xmath60 obtained in this way agree with those of ( [ zetapar],[zetaperp ] ) @xcite . concerning the scaling properties of @xmath60 and @xmath61 ,",
    "the asymptotic @xmath56-dependence is not predicted by the large energy limit . as @xmath66 at @xmath67",
    "the feynman mechanism contribution to the form factors would indicate a @xmath68 behaviour rather than the @xmath69 found in the model .",
    "note however that the @xmath56-dependence is not rigorously established in qcd .",
    "calculating directly from the qcd lagrangian remains an extremely difficult task , in spite of the impressive success of lattice qcd calculations .",
    "a most promising approach is the one based on heavy meson effective lagrangians , which incorporate the heavy quark symmetries and in addition the approximate chiral symmetry for light quarks .",
    "although with increasing data such an approach is the best one beyond direct qcd calculations , a large number of parameters have to be fixed before obtaining predictions .",
    "an intermediate approach consists in using the effective lagrangian at the level of mesons and constituent quarks plus few simple assumptions on the qcd dynamics .",
    "it allows to compute meson transition amplitudes by evaluating loops of heavy and light quarks .",
    "the model describes a number of essential features of heavy meson physics in a simple and compact way , in particular isgur - wise scaling in the heavy - to - heavy semileptonic decays and the large energy limit for the heavy - to - light ones .",
