    "realizing the @xmath0-dimensional associahedron as a convex polytope is a non - trivial task : you are given the _ combinatorics _ of a polytope , and you are supposed to produce _ geometry _ , namely coordinates for a correct realization  such that the vertices correspond to the triangulations of an @xmath1-gon , and the facets to its diagonals , and a vertex lies on a facet if and only if the triangulation uses the diagonal .",
    "the realization problem appeared first in tamari s thesis from 1951 @xcite .",
    "it was explicitly posed by stasheff s 1963 paper @xcite , and first solved somewhat `` by hand '' : as far as we know , the @xmath0-dimensional associahedron was constructed    1963 by stasheff @xcite as a cellular ball ,    1960s by milnor for the first time as a polytope ( lost ) ,    1978 by huguet & tamari ( see @xcite : no proof given ) ,    1984 by haiman ( unpublished , but see @xcite ) , and finally    1989 by lee ( the first published realization : @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently , more systematic construction methods emerged , among them    the construction as secondary polytopes of convex @xmath1-gons ,    the construction from cluster complexes of the root systems @xmath2 , and    the construction as a ( weighted ) minkowski sum of faces of a simplex ,    all of them described in more detail below . in recent work @xcite",
    ", we have discovered that the realizations produced by these three families of constructions are disjoint , and that they can be distinguished by quite remarkable , geometric properties  and moreover , that there are many more realizations that seem natural as well , including the exponentially - sized family of hohlweg & lange @xcite ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sect .  4 ) , and the even larger , catalan - sized family of santos @xcite ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sect .  5 ) .",
    "there are many open problems and some mysteries connected to the realizations of the associahedra as convex polytopes . in this note , we describe three :    there are several very natural , but fundamentally different constructions of the @xmath0-dimensional associahedron , which produce disjoint parameterized families of polytopes .",
    "how do these families lie in the _ realization space _ ( defined below ) of the @xmath0-dimensional associahedron ? how do they relate ?",
    "the associahedron constructed as the secondary polytope of @xmath3 equally - spaced points on a quadratic planar curve turns out to have all its vertices on an ellipsoid .",
    "this phenomenon extends to the permuto - associahedron and to the cyclohedron .",
    "explain !",
    "generalization of triangulations to multitriangulations leads to multiassociahedra and , more generally , to generalized multiassociahedra . up to now",
    ", one can show that these combinatorial objects are vertex - decomposable spheres , but ( how ) can they be realized as convex polytopes ?    of course",
    "this note is written with the hope to clarify the situation and to explain some observations and pieces of progress related to the problems .",
    "however , some mystery remains , and perhaps this is also natural , in view of the sentence that starts haiman s 1984 manuscript @xcite : +",
    "as just mentioned , there are three very natural , but fundamentally different constructions of the associahedron that may be considered to be `` classical '' by now :    as the secondary polytope of a convex @xmath1-gon @xmath4 by gelfand , kapranov & zelevinsky @xcite @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap .  7 ) ) , @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the vertices of an @xmath7-simplex ,    via cluster complexes of the root system @xmath2 as conjectured by fomin & zelevinsky  @xcite and constructed by chapoton , fomin & zelevinsky @xcite , @xmath8 for suitable @xmath9 , and    as minkowski sums of simplices , as introduced by postnikov in @xcite @xmath10},\\ ] ] for arbitrary @xmath11 , which in various different descriptions appears in earlier work by various other authors , including shnider & sternberg @xcite , loday  @xcite , rote & santos & streinu  @xcite .",
    "some of these realizations have very striking properties , such as the vertices on a sphere ( see below ) , or having facet normals in the root system @xmath2 .",
    "one would perhaps expect that `` if you set the parameters right  '' you could get the one - and - only most beautiful realization , but a priori it is not clear , which one would that be .",
    "however , it turned out ( see @xcite ) that these approaches yield fundamentally distinct realizations .",
    "for example , the associahedra produced as the secondary polytopes of a convex @xmath1-gon do nt have _ any _ parallel facets , like the one in the figure ,        whereas the others do , typically with @xmath0 pairs of parallel facets that correspond to certain pairs of intersecting diagonals :        with the huge number of different realizations that are analyzed and distinguished in @xcite , one is led to ask a number of questions about the space of all realizations of the @xmath0-dimensional associahedron :    what is the structure of the space ? is it contractible ( if we divide out the action of the group of affine transformations , say ) ?",
    "is it even connected ?",
    "do the constructions of associahedra that we know cover a large / typical part of the realization space ?",
    "is there any connection between the realizations ?",
    "could we get some types as a deformation / limit of other types ?",
    "the space of all realizations of ( a combinatorial type of ) a convex polytope is known to be a semialgebraic set defined over @xmath12 .",
    "there are various possible definitions , which differ somewhat ; if we do not identify affinely equivalent realizations and decide to only consider realizations with the origin in the interior , then the set of all such realizations  called the _",
    "realization space_ for an @xmath0-dimensional polytope @xmath13 with @xmath14 facets can be identified with the semialgebraic set @xmath15 we refer to richter - gebert @xcite for an extensive treatment of realization spaces of polytopes and to @xcite for an introduction .",
    "the realization space of a simple @xmath0-dimensional polytope with @xmath16 facets can be seen ( if we again require the origin to lie in the interior , and do not divide out a group action ) as an open subset of  @xmath17 .",
    "it is known that realization spaces of some simple polytopes are disconnected  there are sporadic examples in dimension  @xmath18 ( see @xcite ) and systematic constructions for high - dimensional simple polytopes @xcite .",
    "but for the associahedron not much is known beyond dimension @xmath19 , where steinitz proved in 1922 ( @xcite ; see  @xcite ) that the realization space of any @xmath19-dimensional polytopes after dividing out the action of the affine group is a topological ball of dimension @xmath20 .    here",
    "is one observation that needs to be followed up : the secondary polytope construction produces a realization of the @xmath0-dimensional associahedron from any given convex @xmath1-gon .",
    "in other words , we get an associahedron from any convex configuration of @xmath3 points in the plane .",
    "the converse to this turns out to be _ false _ : `` convex position '' is sufficient , but not necessary for getting an associahedron .",
    "[ z_prop : weakly_convex ] the secondary polytope of any configuration of @xmath3 points in the plane , which consists of all the vertices of a convex polygon and at most one point in the relative interior of any edge , is an @xmath0-dimensional associahedron .    the combinatorial structure of the triangulations of a point configuration @xmath13 with these properties is exactly the same as the one for a configuration @xmath4 of points in convex position .",
    "if we cyclically label the vertices of @xmath13 and @xmath4 , a triangulation of @xmath13 corresponds to the triangulation of @xmath4 consisting of the same diagonals of @xmath13 together with the diagonals @xmath21 such that @xmath21 is an edge of the convex hull of @xmath13 that has a relative interior point which does no appear on the triangulation .",
    "of course the point configurations of proposition  [ z_prop : weakly_convex ] are limit cases of strictly - convex configurations , and thus the realizations of the associahedron obtained from them are deformations of secondary polytopes of convex @xmath1-gons .",
    "however , the deformations do not share all their properties : indeed , the following configuration of @xmath22 points        produces an associahedron that has three pairs of parallel facets  which you can never get from a hexagon ( * ? ? ?",
    "so , do we get associahedra from cluster algebras , or associahedra from weighted minkowski sums , as limit cases of secondary polytopes ?",
    "( for dimension larger than @xmath19 we can not expect that ; cf .",
    "* remark 3.6 ) . )    and which more general , non - convex planar point configurations could still produce associahedra ?",
    "the associahedron constructed as the secondary polytope of @xmath0 equally - spaced points on a quadratic planar curve turns out to have all its vertices on an ellipsoid , or in suitable ( and still natural ) coordinates even on a sphere :    [ z_thm : sphericity ] let @xmath23 $ ] be quadratic polynomials such that the convex curve @xmath24 is not a line ( that is , such that @xmath25 are linearly independent ) , and let @xmath26 be equally - spaced points on @xmath27 , that is , @xmath28 for @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "then the secondary polytope of @xmath31 , constructed according to ( [ z_def : secondary ] ) with @xmath32 , has all its vertices on a sphere around the origin .",
    "the description / construction of the secondary polytope of a convex polygon as given here is motivated by the more general setting of _ fiber polytopes _ provided by billera & sturmfels @xcite ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lect .  9 ) .",
    "theorem [ z_thm : sphericity ] was observed for the special case @xmath33 and @xmath34 by reiner & ziegler @xcite .",
    "the more general theorem  [ z_thm : sphericity ] follows from this by simple functoriality properties of the fiber polytopes : if a polytope projection @xmath35 is composed with an affine transformation of the polygon  @xmath4 , the fiber polytope @xmath36 changes only by a multiplication by a constant factor .",
    "an affine transformation applied to the simplex @xmath37 induces the same transformation on the fiber polytope .    for the 1994 paper @xcite",
    ", the sphericity was discovered by chance , and established by a simple algebraic verification ( with computer algebra support ) , establishing that the length of the _ gkz vector _",
    "( named after gelfand , kapranov and zelevinsky ) @xmath38 does not change under flips @xmath39 .",
    "however , a `` geometric explanation '' was lacking then , and is still lacking now .",
    "the true reason is still a mystery .",
    "this is even more deplorable as the phenomenon occurs in other instances as well .",
    "first , it does quite obviously extend to the realization of the `` permuto - associahedron '' that had been combinatorially described by kapranov @xcite : indeed , the length of the gkz vector does not change under permutation of coordinates .",
    "moreover calculations ( ziegler 1994 , unpublished ) show there is a `` secondary polytope like '' construction of the bott ",
    "taubes `` cyclohedron '' @xcite ( also known as the `` type b '' generalized associahedron ) along quite similar lines , which again shows the same phenomenon : it produces integer coordinates for the cyclohedron , with all vertices on a sphere .",
    "this can be verified in examples using e.g.  ` polymake ` by gawrilow & joswig @xcite , it can be proved algebraically , but _",
    "why _ is it true ?",
    "the boundary complex of the _ dual associahedron _ is a simplicial complex whose vertices correspond to diagonals of a convex polygon , and whose faces correspond to subsets of non - crossing diagonals .",
    "this complex can be naturally generalized to a beautiful family of simplicial complexes with remarkable combinatorial properties .",
    "members of this family are called _",
    "simplicial multiassociahedra_.",
    "let @xmath40 and @xmath41 be two positive integers .",
    "we say that a set of @xmath42 diagonals of a convex @xmath0-gon forms a _ @xmath43-crossing _ if all the diagonals in this set are pairwise crossing . a diagonal is called _",
    "@xmath44-relevant _ if it is contained in some @xmath43-crossing , that is , if there are at least @xmath44 vertices of the @xmath0-gon on each side of the diagonal .",
    "the _ simplicial multiassociahedron _",
    "@xmath45 is the simplicial complex of @xmath43-crossing - free sets of @xmath44-relevant diagonals of a convex @xmath0-gon .",
    "for example , the @xmath46-relevant diagonals of a convex @xmath22-gon ( labeled as in the following figure , left picture ) are @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and the simplicial multiassociahedron @xmath49 is the boundary complex of a triangle ( right ) .",
    "the set of diagonals @xmath50 is not a face because they form a @xmath19-crossing .",
    "@xmath51{z_multiass_6_2}\\ ] ]    the vertices of the multiassociahedron @xmath45 are given by @xmath44-relevant diagonals of the @xmath0-gon , and the facets correspond to _ @xmath44-triangulations _ , that is , to maximal subsets of diagonals that do not contain any @xmath43-crossing .",
    "for the case of @xmath52 , the multiassociahedron is the simplicial complex of non - crossing sets of diagonals , which coincides with the boundary complex of the dual associahedron .",
    "the combinatorial structure of the multiassociahedron has been studied by several authors .",
    "apparently , it first appeared in work of capoyleas & pach @xcite , who showed that the maximal number of diagonals in a @xmath43-crossing - free set is equal to @xmath53 .",
    "nakamigawa @xcite introduced the flip operation on @xmath44-triangulations and proved that the flip graph is connected .",
    "dress , koolen & moulton @xcite obtained a reformulation of the capoyleas ",
    "pach result , and in particular proved that all maximal @xmath43-crossing - free sets of diagonals have the same number of diagonals .",
    "the results of nakamigawa and dress  koolen  moulton imply that the multiassociahedron @xmath45 is a pure simplicial complex of dimension @xmath54 . a more recent approach for the study of @xmath44-triangulations , using star polygons , was given by pilaud & santos @xcite . in 2003 , jonsson @xcite showed that the multiassociahedron is a piecewise linear sphere .",
    "then , he found an explicit @xmath55 determinantal formula of catalan numbers counting the number of @xmath44-triangulations @xcite .",
    "additionally to the result of jonsson about the multiassociahedron being a topological sphere , stump @xcite proved that it is a vertex - decomposable , and thus in particular shellable , simplicial sphere .",
    "see also the results by serrano & stump @xcite .",
    "all these results suggest that the multiassociahedron @xmath45 could be realized as the boundary complex of a simplicial polytope of dimension @xmath56 . however , while for the classical associahedron we have many different construction methods ( see above ) , all the natural approaches seem to fail for the multiassociahedron .",
    "the list of cases for which the multiassociahedron is known to be polytopal is the following .",
    "the multiassociahedron @xmath45 is the boundary complex of a :                recently , the multiassociahedron has been generalized to a family of vertex - decomposable simplicial spheres for finite coxeter groups , by ceballos , labb & stump @xcite .",
    "they suggest a family of simple polytopes called _ generalized multiassociahedra_. this family includes the generalized associahedra @xcite @xcite , and the ( simple ) multiassociahedra of types @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( see @xcite for the type @xmath71 description ) .",
    "however , no polytopal realizations of generalized multiassociahedra have been found except for the coxeter groups of type @xmath72 , and for some particular cases in other types .",
    "the ( simple ) generalized multiassociahedra of type @xmath72 are given by the duals of all even dimensional cyclic polytopes @xcite .",
