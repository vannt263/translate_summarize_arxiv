    "performed not so long time ago @xcite was mentioned , that these `` results lend strong support to the view that any future extension of quantum theory that is in agreement with experiments must abandon certain features of realistic descriptions . ''",
    "rather broad notion of the realistic description may be found in very beginning of the same paper @xcite : `` physical realism suggests that the results of observations are a consequence of properties carried by physical systems . ''",
    "it looks like suggestion for any future extension of quantum theory to evade ideas about results of observation as a consequence of properties carried by physical systems .",
    "the claim about limitations on `` realism '' considered in @xcite is more strong , than in most other works , because it is `` experimentally excluded '' both local models and `` a class of important non - local hidden - variable theories . ''",
    "it is also mentioned , that non - local models outside of this class are `` highly counterintuitive . ''    on the other hand , yet another experiment suggested in @xcite may be considered as an illustration , that paradox of quantum nonlocality may be irrelevant with discussions about reality of wave functions or density matrixes .",
    "the conway - kochen free state ( free will ) theorem @xcite is formulated about results of observations and so illustration of a problem is transferred to classical level .",
    "formally , it even does not matter for spin and twin axioms @xcite , if the measurements are a consequence of quantum or classical properties carried by physical systems or not .",
    "only fin axiom about finite speed of information transfer @xcite or min axiom about locality @xcite include some suggestions about properties of physical processes .",
    "problem with locality demonstrated by conway - kochen theorem is not produced by realism or any other property of physical model .",
    "an advantage of such result declared in @xcite `` is that it applies directly to the real world rather than just to theories .",
    "it is this that prevents the existence of local mechanisms for reduction . ''    in order to avoid discussions about free will @xcite it could be suggested few explanations :    1 .",

    "_ ) obstructing possibility to use abridged version of quantum theory expressed by spin , twin postulates @xcite .",
    "inapplicability of suggestion about definite outcomes ( _ e.g. _ , theories without reduction like everett formulation ) .",
    "so , from the one hand , there are ideas about necessity to abandon realism to have an agreement with experiment @xcite , but from the other hand there is no any guarantee about resolution of problems with consistent description of more complicated tests @xcite .",
    "it could be even said informally , that if classical notion of realism `` is not enough '' to establish interdependences displayed by quantum systems , then the idea to `` abandon certain features of realistic descriptions '' may be a step in a wrong direction .",
