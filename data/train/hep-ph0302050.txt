    "the utility of heavy quarkonium production rates in nuclear collisions as a signature of color deconfinement was proposed more than 15 years ago @xcite . since one expects that the long - range color confining potential will be screened in a deconfined medium , the quark and antiquark constituents of bound states will be liberated .",
    "as the system expands and cools , these constituents will , in general , diffuse away from each other to separations larger than typical hadronic dimensions . when the confining potential reappears , a given heavy quark will not be able to `` find '' its heavy antiquark partner and form heavy quarkonium .",
    "it must then bind with one of the antiquarks within range at hadronization .",
    "since these antiquarks are predominantly the lighter @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 flavors , the final hadronic states will preferentially be those with `` open '' heavy flavor .",
    "the result will be a decreased population of heavy quarkonium relative to that which would have formed if a region of deconfinement had not been present .",
    "this scenario as applied to the charm sector is known as @xmath3 suppression .    at lhc energy ,",
    "perturbative qcd estimates predict that hundreds of pairs of charm - anticharm quarks will be produced in a central lead - lead collision .",
    "this situation provides a `` loophole '' in the matsui - satz argument since there will be copious numbers of heavy antiquarks in the interaction region with which any given heavy quark may combine . in order for this to happen ,",
    "however , one must invoke a physical situation in which quarkonium states can be formed from _ all combinations _ of heavy quarks and antiquarks .",
    "this of course would be expected to be valid in the case that a space - time region of color deconfinement is present but it is not necessarily limited to this possibility .",
    "one can make a model - independent estimate of how such a  recombination \" mechanism would depend on nuclear collision observables . for a given charm quark ,",
    "the probability @xmath4 to form a @xmath3 is proportional to the number of available anticharm quarks relative to the number of light antiquarks , @xmath5 in the second step , we have replaced the number of available anticharm quarks by the total number of pairs initially produced , assuming that the total number of bound states formed remains a small fraction of the total @xmath6 production .",
    "we normalize the number of light antiquarks by the number of produced charged hadrons .",
    "since this probability is generally very small , one can simply multiply by the total number of charm quarks , @xmath7 , to obtain the number of @xmath3 expected in a given event , @xmath8 where the use of the initial values @xmath9 is again justified by the relatively small number of bound states formed .",
    "the essential property of this result is that the growth of @xmath10 , quadratic in total charm , with energy @xcite is expected to be much faster than the growth of total particle production in heavy ion collisions @xcite . without this quadratic mechanism ,",
    "@xmath3 production is typically some small energy - independent fraction of total initial charm production @xcite .",
    "we thus anticipate that the quadratic formation will become dominant at sufficiently high energy .",
    "generic estimates of the significance of this type of formation process can be made @xcite .",
    "here we look at specific predictions of two models which share the above properties and update the expectations to lhc energies .",
    "the statistical hadronization model is motivated by the successful fits of relative abundances of light hadrons produced in high energy heavy ion interactions according to a hadron gas in chemical and thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "extension of the model to hadrons containing heavy quarks underpredicts the observed abundances .",
    "this effect may be attributed to the long time scales associated with thermal production and annihilation of heavy quarks .",
    "the statistical hadronization model as first formulated for charm quarks @xcite assumes that the @xmath6 pairs produced in the initial hadronic interactions survive until their subsequent hadronization , at which time they are distributed into hadrons according to the same thermal equilibrium parameters that fit the light hadron abundances .",
    "chemical equilibrium abundances are adjusted by a factor @xmath11 which accounts for the non - thermal heavy quark density .",
    "one power of this factor multiplies a given thermal hadron population for each heavy quark or antiquark contained in the hadron .",
    "thus the relative abundance of the @xmath3 to that of @xmath12 mesons , for example , may be enhanced in this model .",
    "the value of @xmath11 is determined by conservation of the heavy quark flavor .",
    "for the charm sector , the conservation constraint relates the number of initially - produced c - cbar pairs @xmath13 to their distribution into open and hidden charm hadrons , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of hadrons containing one @xmath16 or @xmath17 quark and @xmath18 is the number of hadrons containing a @xmath6 pair . for most applications , @xmath18 ( and also multi - charm hadrons )",
    "can be neglected compared with @xmath15 due to the mass differences .",
    "thus the charm enhancement factor is simply @xmath19 leading directly to the quadratic dependence of the hidden charm hadron population on @xmath13 .",
    "one can then express the total number of @xmath3 in terms of the various thermal densities , @xmath20 , and the total number of @xmath21 pairs , @xmath13 .",
    "one factor of system volume @xmath22 remains implicit here .",
    "it is generally replaced by the ratio of number to density for total charged hadrons , @xmath23 .",
    "then the number of @xmath3 produced obeys the generic form anticipated in eq .",
    "( [ eqquadratic ] ) .",
    "@xmath24    for collider experiments such as those at the lhc and rhic , relating the corresponding central rapidity densities will be more relevant . since eq",
    "( [ eqstathad ] ) is homogeneous in the total particle and quark pair numbers , it will also be valid if these are replaced by their rapidity densities . to get an order of magnitude estimate",
    ", we choose a `` standard '' set of thermal parameters , @xmath25 mev and @xmath26 , for which the thermal density ratio is approximately @xmath27 . for a specific normalization ,",
    "we assume @xmath28 = 2000 for a central collision at the lhc and take the initial charm rapidity density to be @xmath29 , roughly corresponding to @xmath30 for central collisions @xmath31 . using these inputs ,",
    "one predicts @xmath32 , indicating that several @xmath3 will form through statistical hadronization in a central collision . to put this number in perspective",
    ", it is revealing to form the @xmath3 to @xmath13 rapidity density ratio , 0.025 with the same assumptions .",
    "for comparison , one expects the corresponding hadronic production ratio to be of @xmath33 .",
    "this number would then be significantly reduced if placed in a region of color deconfinement .",
    "thus the efficiency of @xmath3 formation via statistical hadronization at the lhc is expected to be substantial .",
    "these numbers can be easily adjusted to other charm and charged particle densities using eq .",
    "( [ eqstathad ] ) .",
    "variations of the thermal parameters can also be investigated .",
    "for example , if the hadronization temperature is decreased to 150 mev , the prefactor combination of thermal densities increases by approximately a factor of two .",
    "the centrality dependence is controlled by the behavior of @xmath13 and @xmath34 .",
    "the former should be proportional to the nuclear overlap function @xmath35 but is generally recast in terms of the dependence on the number of nucleon participants , @xmath36 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath36 requires a model calculation dependent on the total inelastic cross section , @xmath37 , as well as the nuclear geometry .",
    "we parameterize the expected behavior as a power - law @xmath38",
    ". however , there will be deviations from this behavior for the larger values of @xmath37 expected at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the centrality dependence of @xmath34 at rhic is also consistent with a power - law with exponent @xmath39 1.2 @xcite .",
    "we will use the same dependence for our estimates at the lhc .",
    "it is clear that for sufficiently peripheral collisions one will encounter situations in which the average number of initially produced @xmath6 pairs is of order unity or less . at this point",
    ", one must revisit the assumptions of the original statistical hadronization model which assumed a grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the grand canonical approach is valid only when @xmath13 is large enough for the fluctuations about the average value to be neglibile .",
    "thus for peripheral collisions , one must recalculate the statistical results in the canonical approach where the charm number is exactly conserved , as noted in @xcite .",
    "charm conservation can be implemented via a correction factor @xcite , @xmath40 in the limit of large @xmath41 , the ratio of bessel functions approaches unity and the grand canonical result is recovered . in the opposite limit",
    "when @xmath42 , the ratio of bessel functions approaches @xmath43 . in this limit , the dependence on @xmath13 in eq",
    "( [ eqstathad ] ) changes from quadratic to linear . at the lhc",
    "this effect will not be relevant until one reaches very peripheral events , but at lower energies it can be significant over a much larger range of centralities @xcite .",

    "the results are shown for three different values of @xmath45 , corresponding to @xmath46 , 150 , and 100 .",

    "[ lhcstatcharmovercharm ] .",
    "the same general behavior is seen but the increase with centrality is less pronounced since the @xmath47 is assumed to vary with a larger power , @xmath48 .",
    "all of these ratios are at the percent level for central collisions and hence are larger than expected if the total @xmath3 population were due to initial production followed by suppression in a deconfined medium .",
    "production at the lhc , divided by the open charm multiplicity , @xmath47 , as a function of @xmath36.,width=472 ]    the region of very peripheral collisions deserves some separate comments .",
    "first , there is a rise at low @xmath36 in both figs .",
    "[ lhcstatcharmovernp ] and [ lhcstatcharmovercharm ] due to the onset of corrections from the canonical ensemble treatment",
    ". however , the extremely large values of the ratios as @xmath49 are an artifact of the decreasing interaction volume , @xmath50",
    ". this calculation must be cut off before @xmath51 , i.e. only one interacting pair .",
    "it is also in this region where one must take into account the remaining @xmath3 from initial production .",
    "since the survival probability is maximum for very peripheral collisions and the statistical hadronization process is least effective in this same region , there will be a crossover in the relative importance of the two mechanisms .",
    "some studies have already been performed for this situation at sps and rhic energies @xcite .",
    "finally , there is another lower cutoff in centrality for the statistical hadronization results , needed to avoid a contradiction with the @xmath52 ratio at the sps .",
    "since both of these states receive identical factors of @xmath11 , their ratio must be that predicted for chemical equilibrium in the absence of any charm enhancement or suppression .",
    "although the measured ratio appears to be consistent for more central collisions @xcite , there is an indication that it rises sharply for more peripheral collisions .",
    "most treatments have thus inserted a cutoff of @xmath36 = 100 , below which model predictions become inconsistent @xcite .",
    "the numerical values for @xmath44 are tabulated as a function of impact parameter in table 1 for the three choices of initial charm multiplicity density and the default values of all other quantities .",
    "the kinetic model has been developed @xcite to investigate the possibility that @xmath3 may form directly in a deconfined medium .",
    "this formation takes advantage of the mobility of the initially - produced charm quarks in a deconfined region . in order to motivate this view , consider the `` standard '' physical picture of deconfinement in which quarkonium is suppressed by collisions with free gluons in the medium @xcite .",
    "then the formation process , in which a @xmath16 and @xmath17 in a relative color octet state are captured into a color - singlet quarkonium bound state and emit a color octet gluon , is simply the inverse of the the breakup reaction responsible for the suppression .",
    "this is an inevitable consequence of the suppression picture .",

    "this volume is now time - dependent , accounting for the decreasing charm quark density during expansion . here",
    "the transverse area of the deconfined region is determined not just by the nuclear geometry but by the dynamics which determine the extent of the deconfined region .",
    "this area is modeled by the energy density in terms of the local participant density in the transverse plane , @xmath65 .",

    "the numerical results depend on a number of parameters , including the initial volume and temperature , the time expansion profile , the reaction cross sections , the behavior of the quarkonium masses and binding energies in the deconfined region , and the charm quark momentum distributions . for specifics , see ref .",
    "our previous results have used initial values @xmath30 , 150 , and 100 , spanning a reasonable range of expectations @xcite .",

    "there is a rapid decrease in formation with increasing @xmath69 .",
    "the quadratic dependence on @xmath13 is evident , but there is also a substantial linear component in some of the curves .",

    "the `` smoking gun '' signature of the quarkonium formation mechanism is the quadratic dependence on total charm",

    "in addition , the centrality dependence can be used to identify the quadratic dependence on charm assuming that the initial charm production scales with the number of binary collisions .",

    "there is some additional uncertainty related to the lower cutoff on centrality needed to ensure the quarkonium ratios are consistent with an overall thermal picture .",
    "there is also the possibility that the correction for canonical ensemble effects will involve a thermal volume parameter not necessarily equal to the total system volume @xcite .",
    "in addition , the formation mechanism could be limited to those charm quarks whose phase space separation is within some maximum value , introducing another as yet unconstrained parameter @xcite . with kinetic formation ,",
    "a similar set of uncertainties exist .",
    "there are uncertainties in the space - time properties of the deconfinement region .",
    "in addition , possible variations of charmonium binding energies and reaction cross sections in a deconfined region are at present not well understood .",
    "there are indications that the efficiency of the formation mechanism is considerably reduced when included in a partonic transport calculation @xcite .",
    "the primary uncertainty in both models is still the initial number of charm quarks and their momentum distributions .",
    "the tabulated @xmath3 results should be regarded in this light .",
    "thus numbers may be only an order of magnitude estimate .",
    "however , the variation with centrality and total initial charm should provide experimental signatures which are largely independent of the overall magnitudes .",
