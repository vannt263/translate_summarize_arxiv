    "it is of course not known event - by - event whether a particular event is signal or background ; one only knows the fraction of signal events as a function of @xmath1 , from a fit to the event spectrum as in fig .",

    "this estimator is also unbiased in the large @xmath11 limit , i.e.  it is consistent , and it is very close to reach the minimal variance bound .",
    "the advantage is that it can also be used in cases where the unbinned likelihood method is cumbersome because of large number of events .",
    "event weighting to extract the number of signal and background events was discussed in ref .",

    "a method often found in the literature @xcite is to determine the asymmetry in a @xmath13-standard - deviation region around the peak , a region which includes both signal and background ; then to measure the background asymmetry in some side bands around the signal peak ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) and to use the result to correct the asymmetry measured in the peak region . for sake of simplicity",
    "we will set @xmath12 , so that everywhere below we can write @xmath13 instead of @xmath16 .    the expectation value of the counting rate asymmetry , @xmath17 , in the range @xmath18 is related to @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the following way : @xmath21 where we used @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",

    "[ fom1 ] shows that the fom depends on the choice of both the signal region ( @xmath13 ) and the background region ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) . the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fom ] shows the fom as a function of @xmath35 , for @xmath36 which is a reasonable value to make sure that the side bands include a negligible amount of signal .",
    "the signal region , i.e.  the value for @xmath13 , is chosen in order to maximize the fom for the given @xmath35 .",
    "the fom depends also on the signal to background ratio , here chosen to be 1:1 at @xmath37 , as in fig .",
    "[ massplot ] .",
    "in the large @xmath11 limit , the unbinned maximum likelihood method is known to provide an unbiased estimator for the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which reaches the minimal variance bound .",
    "since the numbers of events @xmath38 and @xmath39 are not fixed , an extended maximum likelihood method has to be used  @xcite . with the definitions @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 the log likelihood function reads :",

    "[ fom ] shows this fom as a function of @xmath35 , i.e. for events in the region @xmath55 . for a given range of data available , defined by @xmath35 ,",
    "it is always larger than the fom obtained with the side band subtraction method shown by the solid line .",
    "the latter method does not reach the minimal variance bound .     as a function of the maximum range of data available defined by @xmath35 , for the classical method of side band subtraction ( solid line ) and for the likelihood or weighting method ( dotted line ) . in the side band subtraction method @xmath36 and for each value of @xmath35 the value of @xmath13 , defining the signal region ,",
    "is chosen in order to maximize the fom .",
    "the figures of merit are normalized to the maximum fom reachable in the likelihood or weighting method in the limit @xmath56 . in this case @xmath57 .",
    "in this section a method to extract @xmath19 ( and simultaneously @xmath20 ) using event weighting is developed .",
    "it is clear that the estimator based on the counting rate asymmetry is not statistically optimal since it gives the same weight to all events .",
    "better estimators can be obtained by weighting each event by the signal strength , @xmath58 , and by the background strength , @xmath59 .",
    "these weight factors coincide with the optimal weights found in  @xcite to extract the number of signal events .",
    "they are used to build the following asymmetries : @xmath60 in the large @xmath11 limit , the expectation values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 are @xmath63 where @xmath64 , as in section  [ lh ] .",
    "the ratios of integrals can easily be obtained from the event sample , e.g. @xmath65 , which results exactly in the set of equations ( [ likelihood - set - equations ] ) found for the likelihood method in the small asymmetry limit .",
    "so the fom is still @xmath66 .",
    "this result can of course also be obtained directly , by simple error propagation using the expressions found for @xmath19 and @xmath20 from eqs .",
    "( [ as ] ) and ( [ ab ] ) .",
    "appendix  [ cov ] shows that the factor @xmath67 is actually the correlation coefficient between @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "this shows that the weighting method and the unbinned likelihood method are identical for small asymmetries .",
    "the advantage of the weighting method is that the estimators derived from eqs .",
    "( [ as ] ) and ( [ ab ] ) can also be used for arbitrary asymmetries , whereas the likelihood method requires in this case a numerical maximization of @xmath70 with loops over all events .",
    "for sake of simplicity , the error calculation was only presented for small asymmetries .",
    "extending it to arbitrary asymmetries is straightforward but lengthy ; it shows that the fom of the weighting method is only slightly smaller than the fom of the unbinned lh method .",
    "for example for a signal to background ratio as given in fig .",
    "[ massplot ] and asymmetries smaller than 50% the decrease in the fom is less than 1% .",
    "the weighting method can also be extended to more complicated cases where for example the acceptance factors @xmath8 are not the same in the two spin configurations or even when the asymmetries have to be determined from four counting rates in order to cancel differences of acceptances and flux factors for the two spin configurations , as in ref .",
    "a comparison of the two curves in fig .  [ fom ] shows that the fom of the likelihood or event weighting method is always larger than the corresponding fom for the classical method . for a signal - to - background ratio of 1:1 at @xmath37 , as in fig .",
    "[ massplot ] , the gain is 23% for @xmath71 and 7% for @xmath72 . for @xmath72",
    "the gain is 2% and 10% for a signal - to - background ratio of 10:1 and 1:10 , respectively .",
    "apart from the gain in statistics it should also be noted that the weighting method avoids the arbitrary choice of the background region which starts here at @xmath73 . for breit - wigner distributions for example",
    "this choice is less obvious .    in summary ,",
    "a new set of two estimators was presented to determine simultaneously signal and background asymmetries .",
    "these estimators are unbiased in the large @xmath11 limit , i.e.  they are consistent . for small asymmetries they are also efficient , i.e.  they reach the minimal variance bound , like the statistically optimal unbinned likelihood method .",
    "this is in contrast to the classical method of side band subtraction .",
    "these estimators can actually be derived from the likelihood method in the case of vanishing asymmetries . for large asymmetries",
    "their variances are still very close to the minimal variance bound .",
    "the advantage of the method is its applicability in cases where the likelihood method is cumbersome .",
    "consider two weight factors @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the covariance between @xmath77 and @xmath78 is given by : @xmath79 if the number of events @xmath11 is poisson distributed , i.e. @xmath80 , one finds cov@xmath81 .",
    "the error on the sums of weights is given by @xmath82 .",
