    "although @xmath7 galaxies are being found in increasing numbers ( _ e.g. _ , c. steidel ; j. lowenthal , this volume ) , their study has been almost exclusively through their ultraviolet ( uv ) flux redshifted into the optical . as such , we merely know about the near - instantaneous star formation rate  the uv continuum is dominated by massive short - lived ob stars , and hence is sensitive to star formation on the time - scale of only @xmath8 years . from studies of local galaxies , morphologies in the uv can be very different from the appearance in the optical ( _ e.g. _ , colley _",
    "_ 1996 , apjlett 473 , 63 ) . to comprehensively study the underlying stellar populations",
    ", one should also utilize longer rest wavelengths , where the light from older and less massive stars may dominate .",
    "a useful spectral feature in the study of stellar populations is the 4000  break , which arises from metal - line blanketing in late - type stars .",
    "even if the stellar population is only moderately evolved , there will still be the balmer break . at high-@xmath9",
    ", these rest - frame optical breaks are redshifted into the near - ir ( figure  1 ) . here",
    "we present preliminary results from an infrared study of stellar populations in a newly - discovered lensed galaxy at @xmath0 . at this redshift , in most cosmologies",
    "the age of the universe is less than @xmath10gyr .",
    "evidence for any semi - evolved stellar population would have significant implications for galaxy evolution in the early universe .",

    "deep ground - based imaging and more recent hst studies of the cluster abell 2390 ( @xmath12 ) have revealed many giant arcs , arising from gravitational lensing of background galaxies . in particular",
    ", a @xmath13 elliptical close to the critical curve of the cluster bisects an extended pair of thin , near - straight arcs ( figure  2 ) .",
    "the brighter northern arc ( @xmath14 ) is @xmath15 long , with the southern component ( @xmath16 ) @xmath17 in length .",
    "the similarity in colours ( @xmath18 , objects 4&5 in pell _",
    "_ 1991 , apj 366 , 405 ) and their positions relative to the caustic suggest that these arcs are lensed images of the same source .",
    "imaging with hst / wfpc2 reveals that the arcs are marginally resolved in the radial direction ( @xmath19 fwhm ) . taking a nave model of a tangentially - stretched spherical source implies a magnification @xmath20 , and more sophisticated lens geometries lead to a magnification of @xmath21 ( frye & broadhurst 1998 , apjlett _ submitted _ , astro - ph/9712111 ) .",
    "the hst images also reveal the presence of two smaller counter - arcs .    an arclet redshift survey by bzecourt & soucail ( 1997 , a&a 317 , 661 ) detected a single emission line at 6137  from the northern component ( their arclet#20 ) , and subsequent keck / lris spectroscopy ( frye & broadhurst 1998 ) confirmed this detection and identified the line as ly-@xmath6 at @xmath0 , on the basis of several rest - frame uv interstellar absorption features .",
    "the southern arc and one of the counter - arcs were also confirmed to be at @xmath0 .",
    "these arcs are amongst the highest - redshift galaxies known , and are not pre - selected for some agn characteristic or extreme luminosity ( they are magnified ) , nor are they preferentially colour - selected for a young stellar population .",
    "thus , we may presuppose them to be lensed images of a ` normal ' galaxy , and this affords us the opportunity to study stellar populations in the early universe , uncontaminated by any contribution from a central engine .",
    "at @xmath22 , the rest - frame optical is redshifted to the near - infrared , and the balmer+4000  break is placed between the @xmath3-band ( at @xmath23 m ) and the @xmath24-band ( at @xmath25 m ) . in figure  1 ( left panel ) we plot the evolution of the @xmath26 colour with age for an instantaneous starburst at @xmath0 .",
    "for this system , the @xmath26 colour is an excellent discriminator of the stellar ages along the arcs .",
    "we recently obtained deep @xmath3 & @xmath4 ( @xmath27 m ) imaging of the arcs in good seeing with the near infrared camera ( nirc ) on the w.  m.  keck - i telescope ( figure  2 ) .",
    "the @xmath4-band approximates to the rest - frame @xmath28-band , and the integrated flux along the brighter northern arc ( @xmath29 ) suggests an intrinsic luminosity of @xmath30 for a @xmath31 cosmology , where @xmath32 is the magnification , and @xmath33 if @xmath34 .",
    "comparison with the wfpc2 images reveals colour gradients along both arcs .",
    "optical spectroscopy shows that only one of the four bright knots of the northern arc has prominent ly-@xmath6 emission ( labeled n4 in figure  2 ) .",
    "the optical / near - ir colours of this are consistent with an ob star , implying a region of active star formation .",
    "however , the broad - band colours integrated along the entire northern arc ( figure  1 , right panel ) show that the overall spectrum is best fit by a more evolved ( @xmath35myr ) population with extinction intrinsic to the source of @xmath36 .",
    "this implies that there are older stars outside the actively star - forming h  ii regions . in some areas , @xmath37 , indicating that @xmath38myr has elapsed since the major episode of star formation ( figure  1 , left ) .",
    "our keck @xmath3- and @xmath4-data allow us to ` age - date ' the stellar populations in this spatially - resolved @xmath11 galaxy by the inferred amplitude of the balmer+4000  break along the transverse extent of the arcs . a more detailed treatment of the near - ir / optical colours will be given in bunker _",
