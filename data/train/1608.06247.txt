    "gene regulatory networks play a central role in cell growth , neural networks are responsible for certain cognitive processes , and metabolic networks determine the biochemical properties of cells @xcite .",
    "social networks such as the interactions of social insects @xcite and professional sports teams @xcite are used to achieve a common goal or outcome .",
    "technological networks such as the internet together with the world wide web allow access to information .",
    "the task these networks are able to perform depend on two common features .",
    "first , each network is built out of a number of components that typically have a complicated structure of interactions , which we refer to as the network s _",
    "topology_. second , the vast majority of these networks are _ dynamic _ in the sense that each network component has a certain behavior that depends on those components it interacts with .",
    "the pattern of behavior that emerges from these interactions is the network s _",
    "dynamics_.    the extent to which a network can perform a certain task typically depends both on the network s topology and dynamics .",
    "for example , an electrical grid with a well - designed structure of power lines , substations , etc .",
    "would likely be considered substandard if it only provided power intermittently .",
    "alternatively , if power was supplied at all times but the design of the power grid limited the number of customers , the same would be true . in this way both the topology and dynamics of a network are important to the network s ability to perform its function .    to complicate things , real - world networks are not only dynamic in terms of the behavior of their elements but also in terms of their topology .",
    "for example , neural networks are continually adding new neurons and connections to process and store incoming information .",
    "social networks are constantly reorganizing themselves as new relationships are formed and old ones are dissolved .",
    "similarly , the world wide web has an ever changing structure of interactions as web pages are updated , added , and deleted ( see @xcite for a review of the changing topology of networks ) .    for the sake of clarity , throughout the paper we will refer to a network s _ evolution _ as the changes that occur in the network s topology over time .",
    "we will use the term _ dynamics _ when referring to the collective behavior of the elements that make up the network , although both the changes in the network s topology and the behavior of these elements are in fact aspects of the network s dynamics .",
    "one of the central questions in network science is how a complex system , i.e. a network , with an evolving structure of interactions can maintain a specific function .",
    "for instance , a beating heart maintains its dynamics even as the cellular structure grows over time .",
    "similarly , electrical grids need to be engineered in a way that allows for power to be supplied even as new power lines , stations , etc .",
    "are added to the existing grid .",
    "the issue is that network growth , although important to the network s function , can have a destabilizing effect on the network s dynamics , which in turn can lead to network failure .",
    "cancer , for instance , which is the uncontrolled growth of unwanted cells is an example of this phenomena in biological networks .    in this paper",
    "we develop a theory that offers a flexible method for modeling the growth of a network .",
    "this method is built around the theory of isospectral network transformations @xcite , which describes how certain changes in a network s structure effect the network s _ spectrum _ , i.e. the eigenvalues associated with the network . since the eigenvalues of a network are related to both the network s structure and dynamics , this allows us to study how changes in the graph s structure effect the network s spectrum and how this impacts the network s dynamics and ultimately its function .    to be resilient to failures networks typically have a certain amount of redundancy in their topology @xcite .",
    "hence , as the topology of a network evolves the network is likely evolves in ways that preserves certain structures useful to the network .",
    "such statistically significant structures are often referred to as network motifs @xcite . using this idea we evolve the topology of a network in a way that preserves to a large extent the network s _ local structure _ , which has the effect of largely preserving the spectral properties of the network .",
    "to evolve the topology of a network we begin by describing its structure of interactions by a graph @xmath4 whose vertices @xmath5 ( nodes ) represent the network s elements ( components ) and whose edges @xmath6 represent the network s interactions .",
    "the graph @xmath4 is evolved by selecting a subset of the network s elements @xmath7 , which we will refer to as the _ core _ of the evolved graph .    to evolve the graph @xmath4 we introduce the notion of a _ branch of components_. the components we consider are the strongly connected components of the graph made up of those vertices not in @xmath8 .",
    "a branch of components consists of either a path or cycle of these components that begins and ends at a vertex of @xmath8 ( see definition [ def : componentbranch ] ) . by merging these branches together",
    "the result is the evolved graph @xmath9 ( see definition [ def : exp ] ) , which represents the network s topology at some later point in time .    because this type of transformation preserves the components of the original graph , the evolved graph is in this sense _ locally indistinguishable _ from the original graph .",
    "the difference is that the evolved graph will typically have many more of these components than the original graph .",
    "this difference in structure is reflected in the difference in the spectrum @xmath10 of the original graph @xmath4 and spectrum @xmath11 of the evolved graph @xmath9 .",
    "this is one of the paper s main results and is described by the following theorem ( see section [ sec2 ] , theorem [ thm1 ] ) .    *",
    "( spectra of evolved graphs ) * let @xmath4 be a graph with vertex set @xmath5 . if @xmath12 let @xmath13 be the strongly connected components of @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the complement of @xmath8 .",
    "then @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of components @xmath18 in the evolved graph @xmath9 and @xmath19 denotes @xmath20 copies of the eigenvalues of @xmath18 .",
    "the spectrum of the evolved graph @xmath9 is then the spectrum of the original graph @xmath4 together with some collection of eigenvalues of the components @xmath13 of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , if a network has a changing topology that can be modeled via a graph evolution then we can effectively predict changes in both the network s topology and spectrum over time . since the dynamics of a network depends on its spectrum ,",
    "the theory of graph evolutions developed in this paper is a potential tool to study the interplay of network growth and function .",
    "a graph evolution also preserves the eigenvectors of graph in a certain way .",
    "specifically , a graph evolution preserves the part of the graph s eigenvectors that correspond to the network s core under some mild conditions ( see section [ sec2 ] , proposition [ prop:0 ] ) .",
    "an important consequence of this fact is that the eigenvector centrality of the network s core is preserved as the network evolves ( see section [ sec2 ] , theorem [ prop10 ] ) .    *",
    "( eigenvector centrality of evolved graphs ) * let @xmath21 be strongly connected with its eigenvector centrality given by the vector @xmath22 . if @xmath7 then the eigenvector centrality of @xmath9 is given by a vector @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the vectors @xmath25 and @xmath26 are respectively the vectors @xmath22 and @xmath23 restricted to the entries indexed by @xmath8 .",
    "another important feature of a graph evolution is that it is extremely versatile in the sense that a graph @xmath4 can be evolved with respect to any subset of its vertex set .",
    "one of the applications of this fact , which we explore in this paper , is to use graph evolutions to determine whether two related or unrelated networks with graphs @xmath4 and @xmath27 are similar in the following way .",
    "is it is fairly straight - forward to devise a rule @xmath28 that selects a unique vertex set of any graph .",
    "for instance , the rule @xmath28 that selects those vertices with highest degree , eigenvalue centrality , clustering coefficient , etc .",
    "is such a rule , which we refer to as a _",
    "structural rule_. two graphs @xmath4 and @xmath27 are considered to be _",
    "similar _ to each other if they evolve into the same graph under the rule @xmath28 , which we write as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the graph @xmath4 evolved with respect to @xmath28 .",
    "it turns out that this notion of similarity , which we refer to as _ evolution equivalence _ , can be used to partition the space of all graphs into those graphs that are similar , i.e. are evolution equivalent , with respect to @xmath28 and those that are not .",
    "this is summarized in the following result ( see section [ sec3 ] , theorem [ thm2 ] ) .    *",
    "( evolution equivalence )",
    "* suppose @xmath28 is a rule that selects a unique set of vertices from any graph , i.e. a structural rule .",
    "then @xmath28 induces an equivalence relation @xmath31 on the set of all graphs where @xmath32 if @xmath29 .",
    "one reason for designing such a rule @xmath28 is that most of the time it is not obvious that two different graphs are equivalent .",
    "that is , two graphs may be similar but until both graphs are evolved with respect to some rule @xmath28 this may be difficult to see . in this paper",
    "we show that by choosing an appropriate rule @xmath28 one can discover this similarity ( see examples [ ex : evoequ ] and [ ex : semiequ ] ) .    in this way",
    ", a rule @xmath28 allows those studying a particular class of networks a way of comparing the _ evolved topology _ of these networks and drawing conclusions about both the evolved and original networks .",
    "of course , it is important that the rule @xmath28 be designed by the particular biologist , chemist , physicist , etc . to have some significance with respect to the nature of the networks under consideration .",
    "in fact , the rule used can be completely arbitrary , i.e. the biologist , chemist , physicist can choose whatever set of elements she or he deems important and disregard the notion of choosing a rule altogether .",
    "although having no fixed rule means that we lose the notion of evolution equivalence , it is still possible to compare the structure of the evolved graphs .",
    "what is important is that many networks currently under study are likely to have features that come to light as these networks are evolved .    not only can a rule @xmath28 be used to discover the similarities between two graphs and their associated networks but this rule can be used to _ sequentially evolve _ the structure of a graph @xmath4 , which results in the sequence @xmath33 this allows one to study the long - term or _",
    "asymptotic evolution _ of a network s topology under @xmath28 .",
    "as opposed to many of the most well - known methods for evolving the topology of a graph , such as preferential attachment @xcite , the sequence of evolutions is deterministic and results in the unique graph @xmath34 after each step . moreover , because of the way in which a graph evolution is defined , the graph @xmath34 becomes sparser after each iteration , which is important as most real networks are sparse @xcite .    to demonstrate how this theory of graph evolutions can be used in the study of network dynamics we consider a class of _ dynamical networks _ , which are dynamical systems with an underlying graph structure , that can be evolved with respect to a given rule @xmath28 .",
    "the specific dynamical property we consider here is stability , which is observed in a number of important systems including neural networks @xcite , epidemic models @xcite , and in the study of congestion in computer networks @xcite .",
    "we show that if a dynamical network @xmath35 is intrinsically stable , which is a stronger form of stability than the standard notion of stability ( see definition [ def : intrinsic ] ) , then the evolved version of this network @xmath36 under any rule @xmath28 remains intrinsically stable .",
    "this is summarized in the following theorem ( see section [ sec:4 ] , theorem [ thm : evostability ] ) .    *",
    "( stability of structurally evolving networks ) * let @xmath35 be a dynamical network and @xmath28 a structural rule . if @xmath35 is intrinsically stable then the evolved network @xmath36 is also intrinsically stable .    additionally , we show that stability by itself is not enough to guarantee that a network will remain stable as its topology evolves ( see example [ ex : loss ] )",
    ". that is , a network may lose its stability as it grows if it is not intrinsically stable .",
    "that is , intrinsic stability provides a way of designing stable networks that maintain stability even as their topology evolves .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce the notion of a graph evolution and prove our first main result regarding the spectrum of an evolved graph ( theorem [ thm1 ] ) . in this section",
    "we also describe how a graph evolution effects the graph s eigenvectors and in particular preserves the eigenvector centralities of an associated network . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we use this theory together with the idea of a structural rule @xmath28 to develop the concept of a evolution equivalence .",
    "that is , we show that any rule @xmath28 can be used to compare and analyze the structure of networks in a variety of ways ( theorem [ thm2 ] ) .",
    "in section [ sec:4 ] we use graph evolutions to evolve the structure of a dynamical system used to model network dynamics . here",
    "we show that if such a network is intrinsically stable then an evolved version of the network is also stable ( theorem [ thm : evostability ] ) .",
    "section [ conc ] contains some concluding remarks .",
    "section [ appendix ] contains a proof of theorem [ thm1 ] together with the necessary parts of the theory of isospectral network transformations needed to prove this result .",
    "the standard method used to describe the topology of a network is a graph .",
    "a _ graph _ @xmath37 is composed of a _ vertex set _ @xmath5 , an _ edge set _ @xmath6 , and a function @xmath38 used to weight the edges @xmath6 of the graph .",
    "the vertex set @xmath5 represents the _ elements _ of the network , while the edges @xmath6 represent the links or _ interactions _ between these network elements . the weights of the edges given by @xmath38 measure the _ strength _ of these interactions .    in general",
    ", the edges @xmath6 of a graph can either be _ directed _ or _",
    "undirected_. for instance , the edges in a graph representing the world wide web are directed since hyperlinks take a user from one page to another .",
    "the internet , which is a physical network of data connections between computers , is represented by a graph that has undirected edges since such connections can transfer data in both directions .",
    "the techniques and results we present are valid for both directed as well as undirected graphs . to describe these both these techniques and results it is worth emphasizing that directed graphs are more general than undirected graphs .",
    "the reason is that an undirected graph can be considered to be a directed graph by replacing each of its edges by two directed edges that point in opposite directions .",
    "similarly , weighted graphs are more general than unweighted graphs since an unweighted graph can be made into a weighted graph by giving each of its edges unit weight .    with this in mind , the graphs we consider in this paper are formally those graphs that are either directed or undirected and either weighted or unweighted .",
    "however , as any such graph can be considered to be a weighted directed graph then , without loss in generality , we consider those graphs @xmath37 that are both weighted and directed .",
    "that is , we let @xmath39 , where @xmath40 represents the @xmath41th network element . we let @xmath42 denote the edge that begins at @xmath40 and ends at @xmath43 . in terms of the network , the edge @xmath42 belongs to the edge set @xmath6 if the @xmath41th network element directly influences or is linked to the @xmath44th network element .",
    "one of the most natural ways of investigating a graph is to analyze its path and cycle structure .",
    "this approach goes back to the origins of graph theory where euler used these ideas to solve the knigsberg bridge problem @xcite .",
    "a _ path _ @xmath45 in the graph @xmath37 is an ordered sequence of distinct vertices @xmath46 in @xmath5 such that @xmath47 for @xmath48 . if the vertices @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the same then @xmath45 is a _",
    "cycle_. if it is the case that a cycle contains a single vertex then we call this cycle a",
    "_ loop_.    a fundamental idea related to the structure of a graph is the notion of a strongly connected component .",
    "the idea is that there may be a path from @xmath40 to @xmath43 but no path from @xmath43 to @xmath40 . in this case",
    "the @xmath44th vertex can be reached from the @xmath41th but not the other way around . in a strongly connected component",
    "every vertex can be reached from every other vertex and so every element in this component of the associated network can have an effect on every other element in the component .",
    "a graph @xmath37 is _ strongly connected _ if for any vertices @xmath51 there is a path from @xmath40 to @xmath43 or @xmath4 consists of a single vertex .",
    "a _ strongly connected component _ of a graph @xmath4 is a subgraph that is strongly connected and is maximal with respect to this property .    because we are concerned with evolving the structure of a network in ways that preserve , at least locally , the structure of a graph",
    ", we will need the notion of a graph restriction . for a graph @xmath37 and a subset @xmath12 we let @xmath52 be the _ restriction _ of the graph @xmath4 to the vertex set @xmath8 , which is the subgraph of @xmath4 on the vertex set @xmath8 along with any edges of @xmath6 between vertices in @xmath8 .",
    "importantly , we let @xmath15 denote the complement of @xmath8 , so that the restriction @xmath14 is the graph restricted to the complement of those vertices not in @xmath8 .",
    "the key to evolving the structure of a graph in a way that preserves to a large extent both the spectral properties of the graph and the graph s _ local structure _ is to look at the strongly connected components of the restricted graph @xmath14 .",

    "one reason for studying these equivalence classes is that it may not be obvious and most often is not that two different graphs belong to the same class .",
    "that is , two graphs may be structurally similar but until both graphs are evolved this may be difficult to see .",
    "one of the ideas we introduce here is that by choosing an appropriate rule @xmath28 one can discover this similarity .",

    "the fact that the strongly connected components of both @xmath225 and @xmath226 consist of a collection of disconnected vertices then @xmath227 hence , @xmath4 and @xmath27 have the same nonzero spectrum .",

    "of course , the rule @xmath28 should be designed by the particular biologist , chemist , physicist , etc . to have some significance with respect to the networks under consideration .",
    "in fact , one can drop the notion of a fixed rule completely and evolve different networks over different subsets that are deemed important to the respective biologist , chemist , or physicist .",
    "although having no fixed rule means that we no longer have the equivalence relation guaranteed by theorem [ thm2 ] , it is still possible and potentially much more useful to compare the evolved topology of different networks which have been evolved in different ways .",
