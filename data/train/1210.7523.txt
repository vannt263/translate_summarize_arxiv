    "the skyrme - faddeev model is an example of a field theory that supports the finite - energy knotted solitons .",
    "the significance of this model has increased noticeably when it has been conjectured that the model can be seen as a low - energy effective classical model of the underlying yang - mills theory @xcite . similarly to many other models @xcite the classical soliton solutions of the skyrme - faddeev model can play a role of adequate normal models useful in description of the strong coupling sector of the yang - mills theory .",
    "the exact soliton ( vortex ) solution of the model has been found within the integrable sector @xcite .",
    "such a sector exists in the version of the model that is an extension of the standard skyrme - faddeev model obtained by including some quartic term different to the skyrme term .",
    "the study of the extended models have been originally motivated by the results of the analysis of the wilsonian action of the @xmath8 yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that also in the case of the complex projective target space @xmath0 the extended skyrme - faddeev model ( in which it has been imposed some special constraints for the parameters of the model ) possesses an exact soliton solutions in the integrable sector @xcite .",
    "the aim of this letter is to investigate if the model possesses also some solutions outside the integrable sector , i.e. , without the constraints .",
    "the study of such models is promising and could be important for understanding some aspects of the strong coupling sector of the yang - mills theory .",
    "the skyrme - faddeev model and its extensions on the @xmath9 target space are usually expressed in terms of the real unit vector @xmath10 .",
    "the dimension of a target space is simply related to the number of degrees of freedom of the model .",
    "for instance , the model with the @xmath9 target space has only two independent degrees of freedom . in order to add more degrees of freedom one can consider some higher dimensional target spaces . the target space ( coset space ) in the case of some higher dimensional @xmath11 lie groups , i.e. @xmath12",
    ", can be chosen in several nonequivalent ways .",
    "recently it has been proposed some formulation of the extended skyrme - faddeev model on the @xmath0 target space @xcite .",
    "the coset space @xmath13 is an example of a symmetric space and it can be naturally parameterized in terms of so called _ principal variable _",
    "@xmath14 , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being the order two automorphism under which the subgroup @xmath17 is invariant i.e. @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath20 defined above satisfies @xmath21 .",
    "we shall consider the field theory in @xmath22 dimensions defined by the lagrangian & = & -tr@xmath23 ^ 2 + tr@xmath24 ^ 2 + & + & ^2 + ^2-^2v [ actionx ] + where @xmath25 is a coupling constant with dimension of mass whereas the coupling constants @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 are dimensionless .",
    "the first term is quadratic in @xmath29 and corresponds with the lagrangian of the @xmath0 model .",
    "the quartic term proportional to @xmath26 is the skyrme term whereas other quartic terms constitute the extension of the standard skyrme - faddeev model .",
    "the novelty of the model ( [ actionx ] ) comparing with that introduced in @xcite is the presence of the potential @xmath30",
    ". the @xmath9 skyrme - faddeev model with the potential have been studied by many authors .",
    "the recent results shown that the extended @xmath9 skyrme - faddeev model in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions possesses some non - holomorphic solutions that do not belong to the integrable sector @xcite . since the extended skyrme - faddeev model on the @xmath0 target space also possesses the integrable sector as well as the exact vortex solutions the natural question is if there exist any solutions that do not belong to the integrable sector ? in similarity to the paper @xcite we study such a possibility in the presence of the potential . as it has been explained below such solutions can be obtained numerically for some choice of the potential .",
    "let us shortly discuss the parameterization of the model .",
    "according to the previous paper @xcite one can parametrize the model in terms of @xmath1 complex fields @xmath31 , where @xmath32 . assuming @xmath33-dimensional defining representation where the @xmath34 valued element @xmath35 is of the form g@xmath36 and where @xmath37 is the hermitian @xmath38-matrix _ ij=_ij- u= u ; u^= u^ [ deltadef ] one can express @xmath39 in terms of @xmath31 .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ actionx ] ) reads = -^-^2v where the symbols @xmath40 and @xmath41 read c_m^2 _ - , _ - .",
    "we shall discuss the specific form of the potential in the further part of the paper .",

    "we introduce the dimensionless coordinates @xmath48 defined as x^0=r_0t , x^1=r_0,x^2=r_0x^3=r_0 z where the length scale @xmath49 is defined in terms of coupling constants @xmath50 and @xmath51 i.e. @xmath52 and the light speed is @xmath53 in the chosen unit system .",
