    "in the evaluation of valence quark distribution , we assumed that the nucleon is composed of three valence - quarks in the following way @xcite : @xmath6 and @xmath7 stand for the quark states @xmath8 . with the convention that there is a summation on the repeated indices as well as integration over @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 @xmath11 are the creation operators for quarks ( nucleons ) and @xmath12 are the totally antisymmetric nucleon wave functions , i.e. @xmath13 the @xmath14 depend on the clebsch - gordon coefficients @xmath15 and the color factor @xmath16 ,    @xmath17    the @xmath18 are the nucleon wave functions in terms of quarks and we write it in a gaussian form ( b @xmath19 nucleon radius ) : @xmath20.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we can define the nucleus state based on nucleon creation operators , i.e. @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the complete antisymmetric nuclear wave functions ( they are taken from faddeev calculations with reid soft core potential .    the quark momentum distributions with fixed flavour in a three nucleon system are defined as , @xmath23 where the sign bar means no summation on @xmath24 and integration over @xmath9 in the @xmath25 indices . by using the above definition , we can calculate the quark momentum distribution for each flavour . in the above equation we use , @xmath26 , the fourier transform of the nucleus wave function . by considering the relativistic correction",
    ", the valence parton distribution at each @xmath2 can be related to momentum distribution for each flavour according to the following equation , @xmath27 evaluating the angular integration , we find that , @xmath28 with @xmath29 where m ( m ) is the quark ( nucleon ) mass , @xmath30 is the light - cone momentum of initial quark and @xmath31 is the quark binding energy .",
    "the valence quark distribution of a bound nucleon can be derived from the free nucleon valence quark distribution function by using the convolution approximation , @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the nucleon momentum distributions in the nucleus . by taking into account the fact that @xmath33 are large only around @xmath34 we can write [ 23 ] @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 being the average removal energy of the nucleon . a typical ansatz for the parton distribution is usually parameterized as , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the normalization factor .",
    "it is appropriate to use the mellin and inverse mellin transformation to calculate the nlo parton distributions in the @xmath40-plane @xcite .    in the nlo , @xmath41 is related to the quark , antiquark and gluon distributions , as follows :    @xmath42 + f_2^c(x , q^2,m_c^2),\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 means the convolution and it is defined as , @xmath44    the charm quark contribution to the proton structure function @xmath45 has the following form in the lo limit , if @xmath46 , ( note that for small x , with this condition @xmath2 can become less than @xmath47 , @xmath48 where @xmath49 and ( @xmath50 is the number of active flavours ) @xmath51 with ( @xmath52 ) @xmath53 the longitudinal sf,@xmath54 is obtained as :    @xmath55 + f_l^c(x , q^2,m_c^2)\\ ] ]    with @xmath56 we use the lo expression for @xmath57 , which is the same as equation ( 3 ) i.e. @xmath58    here we assume the su(3 ) flavour - symmetric sea quark distributions @xmath59 .",
    "in addition we consider the sea quark and gluon contributions to vanish in the static point @xmath60 , ( we set @xmath61),i.e , @xmath62 note that , this is the scale where the above initial condition is approximately satisfied i.e. the @xmath63 scale is determined from the intermediate @xmath64 scale by evolving downward the second moment of the valence quark distributions such that the gluon and sea quark distributions are approximately zero at the @xmath63 scale .     and ( b ) @xmath65 for various charm mass .",
    "the data are from various zeus and h1 collaborations experiments.,width=245 ]",
    "in figure 1 , we present the charm quark contribution to the structure function of proton at ( @xmath66 ) with different charm mass values i.e. @xmath67 ( small - dash curve ) , @xmath68 ( dash - small - dash curve ) , @xmath69 ( full curve ) and @xmath70 ( dash curve ) .",
    "the data are those of h1 @xcite and zeus collaborations @xcite , i.e. the squares ( zeus,1997 ) , circles ( h1,2000 ) , diamonds ( zeus,2000 ) and triangles ( zeus,2004 ) .",
    "our results are in very good agreement with the present available data . by reducing the charm mass , the charm structure function of proton increases but it still passes though the data .",
    "it also becomes zero for @xmath71 . obviously the structure function becomes larger as we increase @xmath2 .",
    "the calculated @xmath3 by using the gluon distribution of grv ( heavy - full curves ) with @xmath72 shows less charm quark contribution to the structure function of proton .",
    "figures 2 and 3 show the comparison of @xmath2 dependence of charm contribution to the structure function of proton for various x values with the available zeus data ( the triangles ( 1997 ) , circles ( 2000 ) and squares ( 2004 ) ) . we get a reasonable result with respect to the data [ 2 ] .",
    "the @xmath2 dependence of longitudinal structure function of proton are given in figure 4 .",
    "the data are from h1 collaboration experiments : the circles ( h1,2001 ) and triangles ( h1,1996 ) .",
    "again there are a good agreement between our calculated results and the experimental predictions data .",
    "these show that our gluon distribution can reasonably well treat the pgf process .",
    "we have observed a linear @xmath2-dependence in the unpolarized structure function which is in a very good agreement with the available data .",
    "a smooth behavior was found for the sea - quark and gluon distribution functions .",
    "the agreement between our uniquely gluon and sea quarks distributions and the available data are encouraging .",
    "in particular we fully reproduced the gluon distribution .",
    "we note that the above assumption where the gluon and the sea - quark distributions can be generated entirely radiatively from valence quark may not be valid , especially at small x.    in summary , by using our recent complete nlo calculation in the conventional @xmath73 factorization scheme , we have updated our previous nlo results by including the charm contribution to the sf of proton .",
    "we have found that the proton structure function has approximately the same @xmath2-dependence as the data and the whole results are consistent with the available experiments .",
    "our calculation shows a similar scaling violation as the one observed in the experiment for the small x. the idea that at low x the scaling violation of @xmath74 comes from the gluon density alone and does not depend on the quark density which was tested in our previous work , is still valid with a good accuracy .",
    "so , as before , we may conclude that the gluon is the dominant source of the parton in the small x region .",
    "however , it is well known that the theoretical interpretation of sf is complicated at low @xmath2 . since ,",
    "in this region the higher twist contributions which are proportional to @xmath75 and @xmath76 are not included in the dglap equations .",
