    "motivated by ideas about quantum gravity , a tremendous amount of efforts over the past decade has gone into testing local lorentz invariance ( lli ) in various regimes @xcite .",
    "this paper summarizes the framework allowing one to test lli using high - accuracy astrometric observations .",
    "the basic idea is that the usual special - relativistic aberrational formulas used in the corresponding relativistic models is a direct consequence of the lorentz transformations @xcite .",
    "a generalization of that aberrational formula obtained with generalized lorentz transformation contains parameters ( similar to the mansouri - sexl ones ) and can be directly used to test lli @xcite .",
    "especially the future esa mission gaia @xcite will provide a lot of high - accuracy astrometric data that will be used to make independent tests of lli .",
    "the transformation between preferred coordinates @xmath0 and non - preferred ones @xmath1 read @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 here , @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the velocity of the origin of the system @xmath6 with respect to @xmath0 , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are arbitrary functions of @xmath11 .",
    "let us consider the relation between directions of light propagation of a given light ray in the preferred frame @xmath12 and that in the non - preferred one @xmath13 .",
    "here we consider the same light ray as seen by an observer at rest relative to @xmath14 and another observer ( co - located with the first one ) at rest relative to @xmath6 . taking the differentials along the light ray we have @xmath15 for the preferred frame ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 for the non - preferred frame .",
    "the last normalization is needed since the light velocity is not equal to @xmath18 in the non - preferred frames and therefore vector @xmath19 is not an euclidean unit vector . using the coordinate transformations between @xmath0 and @xmath6 given above we get the transformations between @xmath20 and @xmath21 in closed form : @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 . in the limit of special relativity one gets the normal special - relativistic aberrational formulas .",
    "note that the transformation between @xmath20 and @xmath21 depends only on @xmath25 and does not depend on @xmath7 and @xmath26 .",
    "this demonstrates that the aberrational formula tests the same properties of the lorentz transformation as the michelson - morley experiment , that is , the isotropy of light velocity .",
    "in practice the aberrational formula entering relativistic models @xcite corrects for aberration due to the velocity of the observer relative to the barycenter of the solar system .",
    "the solar system barycentric reference system is not usually assumed to be the preferred system in the sense of the lli .",
    "therefore , we have to consider three reference systems : one preferred system @xmath0 , two non - preferred ones  system @xmath6 attached to the barycenter of the solar system , and one more system @xmath27 attached to the observer .",
    "the transformation between the preferred and non - preferred coordinates are given above .",
    "the only parameter of the transformations is the velocity of the origin of the non - preferred coordinates in the preferred ones .",
    "the velocity of the origin of @xmath6 relative to @xmath0 is @xmath5 .",
    "the velocity of the origin of @xmath27 relative to @xmath0 is @xmath28 and relative to @xmath6 is @xmath29 .",
    "the relation between these three velocities follows from the coordinate transformations and reads ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) @xmath32 finally , denoting @xmath33 the direction of light relative to @xmath27 , combining ( [ s - s])([s - s ] ) written for two non - preferred coordinate systems and using ( [ velocity_90 ] ) one gets @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an orthogonal matrix of the thomas - like precession , and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the usual mansouri - sexl parameters ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 in special relativity ) .",
    "the thomas precession plays no role here since pure rotation can not be observed in astrometry ( can not be distinguish from the local rotation of the observer ) and the operational reference system attached to the observer is chosen not to rotate with respect to the barycentric reference system .",
    "( [ final ] ) gives the generalized aberrational formula .",
    "in addition to the barycentric velocity of the observer @xmath41 , this formula contains the parameter @xmath42 and the velocity of the solar system barycenter relative to the preferred frame @xmath43 . taking the value of @xmath5 from the dipole of the cosmic microwave background , one can determine @xmath42 .",
    "alternatively , both @xmath42 and @xmath5 can be determined from astrometric observations .",
    "more details on the derivation and interpretation of this formula will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
