    "during the last decades , enormous progresses have been made in such physical contexts as cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed )  @xcite , superconductor - based circuits  @xcite , and trapped ions  @xcite . in connection with the applications in the field of quantum information  @xcite , seminal experimental results have been reached , such as the implementations of quantum logical gates  @xcite and the realizations of quantum teleportation  @xcite .",
    "generation of quantum states is a crucial issue in nano - technologies , because it is the basis of initialization processes with which many experimental protocols begin .",
    "incidentally , it also provides the possibility of observing physical systems behaving according to the predictions of quantum mechanics once a nonclassical state has been created .",
    "recently , a strategy for the generation of pure quantum states through extraction from arbitrary initial states has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "this procedure is based on the idea of putting a quantum system in interaction with another one that is repeatedly measured in order to induce a non - unitary evolution which forces the former system onto a hilbert subspace .",
    "if such a subspace is one - dimensional , the process reduces to the extraction of a pure quantum state . for this reason ,",
    "this procedure has been addressed as a `` purification ''  @xcite . on the basis of this general scheme ,",
    "many applications have been proposed : it is possible to extract entanglement  @xcite , and the initialization of multiple qubits would be useful for quantum computation  @xcite ; extensions of the scheme enable us to establish entanglement between two spatially separated systems via repeated measurements on an entanglement mediator  @xcite ; in single trapped ions , the extraction of angular - momentum schrdinger - cat states has been proposed  @xcite and the possibility of steering the extraction of pure states through quantum zeno effect has been predicted  @xcite . in passing ,",
    "we mention that the approach here recalled is related to quantum non - demolition measurements  @xcite , introduced for gravitational wave detection  @xcite and exploited in different physical systems for applications in quantum computation and information  @xcite and for quantum state generation in general . for instance , in the context of trapped ions , putting the vibrational degrees of freedom in interaction with the electronic degrees of freedom , and repeatedly measuring the atomic state , it is possible to generate fock states both in one - dimensional  @xcite and two - dimensional contexts  @xcite .    until now",
    ", the extraction of pure states through repeated measurements has been considered in ideal situations , that is , the evolution is assumed to be unitary except for the change of state by the measurements . in this paper",
    ", we discuss how the predictions change when the system is put in interaction with an environment and , as a consequence , is subject to a non - unitary evolution ( even between two successive measurements ) , which is assumed to be described by a lindblad - type equation  @xcite .",
    "first of all in this paper , we discuss the behavior of a quantum system , whose dynamics is governed by the repeated measurements represented by projection operators on the other system in interaction with the former and by the dissipative environmental interaction with the two quantum systems .",
    "a criterion for the extraction of pure states in the presence of dissipation is derived and a quantum system composed of two two - level systems ( qubits ) immersed in a common bosonic bath is analyzed as a very simple example . the ability or disability of extracting pure states for a one qubit system by this scheme is estimated numerically in terms of the purity of the density operator .    the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : general_sketch ] , the general aspects of the purification protocol in the presence of interaction with an environment are discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : simplest ] , a simple model of two mutually interacting two - level systems immersed in a bosonic bath is analyzed , and the main differences between the ideal situation ( in the absence of dissipation ) and the more realistic situation here studied ( in the presence of dissipation ) are singled out . finally , some conclusive remarks are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the scheme of extraction we study in this paper is based on the idea presented in ref .",
    "assume that we are interested in preparing a target system , @xmath0 , into a pure state .",
    "to this end , put it in interaction with an ancilla system , @xmath1 , which is repeatedly measured and found in the same state , say @xmath2 . as a consequence of both the interaction with and the measurements on @xmath1 , system @xmath0 is subject to a non - unitary dynamics which forces it in a subspace .",
    "if the subspace is one - dimensional , the relevant state is extracted .",
    "we underline that if a negative result is obtained measuring system x ( i.e. , if the ancilla system is found in a state different from the expected one ) , then the trial can be considered as `` failed '' and the system has to be reset in order to restart the experiment , or we can just continue the process as a new trial with the initial condition given by the result of the unsuccessful projection .    in the following",
    ", we consider this scheme but in the presence of dissipation , in order to examine whether a pure state can still be extracted . to this end , assume now that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are immersed in a bath , so that the dynamics of the whole system s+x between the repeated measurements is governed by the master equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the density operator of + ( the trace over the bath degrees of freedom has already been performed ) .",
    "@xmath5 is the hamiltonian superoperator defined by @xmath6 $ ] , while @xmath7 is the lindblad - type dissipator  @xcite which takes into account the interaction with the environment , in the markovian limit .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the superoperator describing the dissipative dynamics of s+x and @xmath9 the projection superoperator associated with the measurement of the state @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath10 assuming that the time elapsed between two successive measurements is always @xmath11 and that every of the @xmath12 measurements has confirmed x to be in the state @xmath13 , the initial state @xmath14 is mapped into the final one , @xmath15 where @xmath16 which , although rigorously speaking acts on liouville space  @xcite of the whole system + , is substantially a superoperator acting on the liouville space of subsystem @xmath0 , except for the trivial action on @xmath1 ( i.e.  projection on the state @xmath2 ) .",
    "therefore , it can be rewritten as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a superoperator acting only on the liouville space of @xmath0 .    if the master equation is given in the lindblad form  @xcite , the evolution of s+x in interaction with the bath is written down in the kraus representation  @xcite as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of kraus operators @xmath21 involved in the decay process .",
    "therefore , the superoperator @xmath22 that maps the state of s just after a measurement to another after the next measurement reads @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the state of s and @xmath25 is an operator acting on the hilbert space of s. note that the state of the whole system s+x after a measurement is factorized like @xmath26 .",
    "the properties of @xmath22 determine the fate of the state of @xmath0 , after many repetitions of measurements on @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , assume that @xmath22 is diagonalizable and consider its spectral decomposition in terms of its eigenprojections  @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the eigenprojection belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath29 and satisfies the ortho - normality and completeness conditions @xmath30 the eigenvalues @xmath29 are complex - valued in general and ordered in such a way that @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath22 is not diagonalizable , the jordan decomposition applies instead of ( [ eqn : spectraldecomp ] )  @xcite .",
    "generalization of the following argument to such cases is straightforward .",
    "see , for instance , an appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the evaluation of the @xmath32th power of @xmath18 shows that , the larger the number @xmath32 of the repeated measurements is , the more dominant the blocks belonging to the maximum ( in modulus ) eigenvalues are over the other blocks .",
    "that is , for a large enough @xmath32 , the action of @xmath33 diminishes the components of the system density operator which do not belong to the generalized eigenspaces corresponding to the maximum ( in modulus ) eigenvalues .",
    "indeed , @xmath34 which , in the case wherein only one eigenvalue exists whose modulus is maximum ( i.e.  when @xmath35 ) , reduces to @xmath36 therefore , in such a case , for a large enough ( depending on the structure of the spectrum ) @xmath32 , the action of @xmath33 essentially reduces to the action of @xmath37 , hence projecting the system in the relevant subspace .    as for the outcome state",
    ", it is worth mentioning that , if @xmath38 is degenerated , the state of s extracted by @xmath37 depends on the initial state of @xmath0 , @xmath39 , since such a final state is substantially proportional to @xmath40 , which depends on @xmath39 if @xmath37 refers to a multi - dimensional space . on the contrary , if @xmath38 is not degenerated and @xmath37 refers to a one - dimensional subspace , i.e. @xmath41 with @xmath42 the relevant eigenstate ( which is an element of the liouville space of @xmath0 ) and @xmath43 a suitable form on the liouville space of @xmath0 , the eigenstate @xmath42 is extracted irrespectively of the initial condition of the system , provided @xmath44 . as a first step , in this paper we shall concentrate on such situations wherein there is a single extracted eigenspace which in addition is one - dimensional .    in an ideal case wherein any sources of dissipation are absent , eq .",
    "( [ eq : krauscontracted ] ) reduces to @xmath45 with @xmath46  @xcite , so that , if @xmath47 possesses a nondegenerate and unique maximum ( in modulus ) eigenvalue , then the final state to be extracted is the pure state @xmath48 , since in this case eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pi0 ] ) is supplemented by @xmath49 and @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the right- and left - eigenvectors of @xmath47 belonging to its largest ( in modulus ) eigenvalue , respectively .",
    "this is the basic idea of the purification scheme based on the repeated measurements , which was first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and has been analyzed and developed in refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is important to stress that in the non - ideal case , even if there is a single and nondegenerate eigenvalue that is maximum in modulus , this does not guarantee that the state @xmath42 is a pure state and hence there is no warranty that the final extracted state is pure , either . in this sense",
    ", our state - extraction scheme may not necessarily be an effective purification scheme .",
    "however , we still try to seek a possibility of extracting a pure state even in the presence of dissipation .",
    "the examination of such situations wherein we can extract a pure state is the main topic of this paper .",
    "_ efficiency _  this scheme for extracting quantum states is a conditional one , in the sense that each time system @xmath1 is measured it has to be found in the same state , denoted by @xmath2 . in refs .  @xcite it is proved that the probability of success of the extraction , that is the probability of finding system x in the state @xmath2 successively @xmath32 times , is given by the normalization factor of the state extracted by ( [ eq : nonideal_woperator ] ) , @xmath53 , which behaves asymptotically as @xmath54 as @xmath55 [ or @xmath56 in the more general situation , which from now on we shall not mention anymore for the sake of simplicity ] .",
    "these expressions for the probability of success ( still valid in the non - ideal case , provided the projectors @xmath28 are the appropriate ones ) show that the structure of the spectrum of @xmath18 plays a crucial role for the efficiency and fastness of the extraction .",
    "in particular , on the one hand , the fact that @xmath38 has a modulus quite larger than those of the other eigenvalues makes @xmath57 quickly approach @xmath58 , so that a smaller number of measurements is required to well approximate the final result @xmath40 . on the other hand , the closer to unity the modulus of @xmath38 is , the greater the probability of success is , approaching just @xmath59 ( without decaying out completely ) for @xmath60 . on the contrary , for small values of @xmath38 ,",
    "the probability quickly approaches zero like @xmath61 , which means that if a large number of measurements is required to approach the state @xmath62 the scheme becomes very inefficient .",
    "therefore , the number of measurements necessary to extract the target state would be an important measure of efficiency",
    ". it can be roughly estimated by the following argument .",
    "the idea is to see how much the relevant part approaching the target state , @xmath63 , dominates over the rest : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a certain norm , for instance @xmath66 .",
    "this measure approaches unity in the limit of an infinite number of measurements , @xmath67 as @xmath55 .",
    "then , we ask how many measurements are necessary for this quantity to exceed a desired value @xmath68 . after rewriting as @xmath69 , a sufficient condition for @xmath70",
    "is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the number of eigenvalues or equivalently the dimension of the liouville space and @xmath73 .",
    "the number of measurements necessary to get a better quality than @xmath74 is therefore estimated by @xmath75 + \\ln(m-1 ) + \\ln\\frac{r(\\rho(0))}{\\|\\pi_0\\rho(0)\\| } } { \\ln|\\lambda_0/\\lambda_1|}.\\ ] ] it is important to note that this threshold depends on @xmath76 , according to the expectation that the larger is the norm of the relevant part in the initial state , @xmath77 , the smaller is the number of necessary measurements .",
    "it is easy to show that a necessary and sufficient condition for a pure state being an eigenvector of the map @xmath18 is that it is a simultaneous eigenstate of all the operators @xmath78 involved in the relevant map ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : krauscontracted ] ) ) .",
    "the proof of this statement proceeds as follows .",
    "@xmath79 obviously , if the state @xmath80 is a common eigenstate of all @xmath81 s , i.e. , @xmath82 and consequently @xmath83 , then one has @xmath84 where @xmath85    @xmath86 let the pure state @xmath87 be an eigenvector of @xmath18 , then @xmath88 .",
    "consider now the overlap with a quantum state @xmath89 orthogonal to @xmath90 : @xmath91\\\\ & = \\sum_{k=0}^g|{{}_{{\\text{s}}}\\hspace*{-0.2mm}\\langle{\\phi_\\perp}|}\\hat{v}_k(\\tau){|{\\phi}\\rangle}_{\\text{s}}|^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which it follows that @xmath92 for all @xmath93 and whatever the state @xmath94 is , provided it is orthogonal to @xmath80 . in other words , it means that @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a suitable complex number .",
    "this completes the proof .      in those cases in which we are not able to extract an exactly pure state",
    ", there is a possibility of extracting `` almost pure '' states , that is , mixed states very close ( in the sense of purity ) to the pure states . to look for almost pure states which can be extracted ,",
    "let us recall a measure of purity of a given state .",
    "we show later how the purity of the eigenstate of the linear map @xmath18 corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue behaves as a function of the parameters of the scheme , i.e.  the interval of time @xmath11 and the repeatedly measured state of @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "the purity of a state is defined as the trace of the square of the relevant ( normalized ) density operator  @xcite : @xmath97 this quantity is upper and lower bounded in accordance with @xmath98 with @xmath99 being the number of levels of the system under scrutiny .",
    "observe that the maximum value [ @xmath100 corresponds to pure states , while the minimum value [ @xmath101 corresponds to maximally mixed states with maximal von neumann s entropy .",
    "it is possible to derive a formula for the purity of the extracted state for general systems in the weak - damping regime",
    ". such a formula would be useful for understanding which parameters spoil the purity and convenient for an optimization of the purification .",
    "let us decompose the relevant map @xmath22 into two parts , @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the map in the absence of the environmental perturbation and the rest is treated as a perturbation to it , which is given in the weak - damping regime by @xmath104    assuming that @xmath47 is diagonalizable , let @xmath105 and @xmath106 denote its right- and left - eigenvectors , respectively , which form a complete ortho - normal set , @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "( we also normalize the right - eigenvectors as @xmath108 . ) then , the right - eigenvectors of the ideal map read @xmath109 these are orthogonal to the left - eigenvectors @xmath110 in the sense @xmath111 we are interested in a situation where we can purify s in the absence of the environmental perturbation .",
    "that is , @xmath112 is not degenerated and is the only eigenvalue that is the largest in modulus .",
    "now , the standard perturbative treatment yields the first - order correction to the right - eigenvector , @xmath113 where the constant @xmath114 is set equal to zero by the normalization condition @xmath115 .    this formula is valid when @xmath116 is not degenerated .",
    "we are interested in the state to be extracted , i.e.  @xmath117 .",
    "since @xmath112 has been assumed to be nondegenerated , the formula ( [ eqn : deltasigma ] ) is valid for @xmath118 .",
    "the purity of @xmath119 up to this order is therefore given by @xmath120\\\\ & = 1 - 2\\sum_{mn\\neq 00 } { { } _ { \\text{s}}\\hspace*{-0.2mm}\\langle{u_n}|}\\hat{q}_0{|{u_m}\\rangle}_\\text{s } \\frac{(\\tilde{\\sigma}_{mn}^{(0)},\\delta\\mathcal{v}(\\tau)\\sigma_{00}^{(0)})}{\\lambda_{00}^{(0)}-\\lambda_{mn}^{(0 ) } } , \\label{eqn : perturbativepurity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath121 is a projection operator .",
    "this is the formula for the purity of the extracted state up to the first order in the decay constants in the weak - damping regime .",
    "this shows that , if the state @xmath122 to be extracted in the ideal case is an eigenstate of the perturbation , i.e.  @xmath123 , the first - order correction to the purity vanishes and the purification is robust against the environmental perturbation , at least up to this order .",
    "this is a weaker version of the criterion discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : criterion ] and is convenient since the dissipator of a master equation , @xmath7 , suffices to this criterion without knowing the kraus operators @xmath21 of the decay process , which may require solving the master equation .",
    "furthermore , this formula would be useful for finding a parameter set that optimizes the purity ( minimizes the first - order correction to the purity ) .",
    "when s is a two - level system , the formula ( [ eqn : perturbativepurity ] ) is reduced to @xmath124",

    "[ sec : general_sketch ] , is not in the scope of this paper since it does not permit the extraction of a precise state irrespectively of the initial state of the system .",
    "notice that the general case corresponding to measuring a generic state @xmath2 can be discussed in the weak damping limit through the perturbation analysis .",
    "the analysis on the model has so far been focused on the zero - temperature case and showed that the only pure state that can be extracted at the zero temperature is @xmath232 when the state of x is repeatedly measured and found in @xmath203 or @xmath193 .",
    "the question of what happens in the case of non - zero temperature naturally arises . to answer this question , we resort to numerical calculations .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "let us summarize the results reported in this paper . putting a system in interaction with a repeatedly measured",
    "one forces the former system onto a subspace , hence realizing , under suitable conditions , the extraction of pure states . in a more realistic situation",
    ", the two systems are interacting with their environment too , and therefore are subjected to dissipation .",
    "such an interaction practically reduces the chance to extract pure states .    from the mathematical point of view",
    ", the main difference between the two situations is represented by the fact that in the ideal case one extracts eigenvectors of a map onto a hilbert space , whereas in the non - ideal case one extracts eigenvectors of a map onto a liouville space .",
    "we have explored the general framework and studied a very simple physical system ( two spins interacting with a bosonic bath ) in order to bring to light fundamental features of repeated - measurement based extraction processes in the presence of dissipation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : very_special_case ] , we have shown that a mixed state is extracted instead of a pure state . actually , this is what generally happens , especially at high temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , with a zero - temperature bath , it is still possible to extract pure and almost pure states ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : purity_parameters](b ) ) with still fairly good efficiency .",
    "and its purity is @xmath233 .",
    "observe that the purity reaches the maximum value at @xmath234 and then decays to an asymptotic value . here , the parameters are @xmath235 , @xmath236 , and @xmath237 , and we have set @xmath238 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath241.,scaledwidth=48.0%,scaledwidth=28.0% ]    indeed , the efficiency , though negatively affected by the environment , is still good at zero temperature .",
    "overall , we have considered the case wherein a very large number of measurements ( evaluating the mathematical limit for an infinite number of measurements ) is performed on the ancilla system , as clearly expressed by ( [ eq : vton_general ] ) and ( [ eq : vton_special ] ) .",
    "we conclude this paper expecting that in some cases a reduction of the number of measurements performed on the ancilla system entails an increase of the purity of the output state .",
    "see , for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : purity_vs_n ] , wherein we have plotted the purity of the resulting quantum state as a function of the number of measurements performed on the ancilla system , starting from the maximally mixed initial state , with a particular parameter set .",
    "it is well visible that the purity , starting from its minimum value ( @xmath242 ) , increases at the second measurement , and then decreases down to its asymptotic value .",
    "therefore , in such a case , the highest value of purity is obtained for a smaller number of measurements ( @xmath234 ) .",
    "we will discuss this aspect of our scheme in the next future .",
