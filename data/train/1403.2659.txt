    "binary systems are an invaluable source of knowledge of the physical parameters of the stars . during some stage of stellar evolution most binary stellar systems undergo interactions between the components .",
    "the interactions turn on and off at various evolutionary stages , depending on the separation of components . among the most interesting examples of such systems",
    "are the symbiotic systems . these are still often called symbiotic stars because their binary nature which we now consider obvious was controversial only thirty years ago .",
    "symbiotic systems are long - period interacting binaries in which an evolved giant transfers material to a hot and luminous companion surrounded by an ionized nebula",
    ". the hot component of the vast majority of symbiotic systems is a white dwarf ( wd ) although in two cases , v2116oph @xcite and v934her @xcite , a neutron star has been found .",
    "there are two distinct classes of symbiotic binaries .",
    "the s - type ( stellar ) have normal red giants and orbital periods in the range @xmath0115 years . the d - type ( dusty ) have mira primaries usually surrounded by a warm dust shell and orbital periods of typically decades to centuries .",
    "mass exchange is the property that defines the symbiotic class . even in the d - type systems the components are still close enough to allow the wds to accrete material from the giant s stellar wind .",
    "symbiotic systems are the interacting binaries with the longest orbital periods .",
    "their study is essential to understand the evolution and interaction of detached and semi - detached binary stars .    the rich and luminous circumstellar environment surrounding the interacting symbiotic stellar members results from the presence of both an evolved giant with a heavy mass loss and a hot companion copious in ionizing photons often producing its own wind . the cool giant and the hot dwarf produce strongly different environments such as ionized and neutral regions , dust forming region(s ) , accretion / excretion disks , interacting winds , bipolar outflows , and jets .",
    "such a complex multi - component structure makes symbiotic stars a very attractive laboratory to study many aspects of stellar evolution in binary systems .",
    "firming links between symbiotic systems and related objects are essential to the understanding , for instance , of the role of interacting binaries in the formation of stellar jets , planetary nebulae , novae , supersoft x - ray sources ( ssxs ) , and supernovae type ia ( sn ia ) .",
    "many of these issues concerning the late stages of stellar evolution are presently poorly understood but have important implications on our understanding of the stellar population and chemical evolution of galaxies as well as the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "chemical composition is one of the major parameters along with initial mass that determine stellar evolution .",
    "chemical composition has a strong influence on many important astrophysical processes .",
    "in the case of symbiotic stars it is generally believed that the symbiotic appearance and activity is triggered by high mass - loss rate of the giant ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) possibly due to its enhanced metallicity @xcite .",
    "the apparent deficit of extrinsic c or s stars , i.e. cool components polluted by the s - process and c - rich material from the former tp - agb companion , is among the most interesting problems raised by the s - type symbiotic binaries .",
    "there are other red giant  white dwarf binary star families with abundance peculiarities , for instance the barium stars and tc - poor s stars .",
    "these families have orbital parameters similar to those of symbiotic systems but do not exhibit symbiotic activity .",
    "the hot component of most symbiotic systems is a white dwarf and , at least in some systems , the white dwarf mass is higher than 0.5  @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "white dwarfs of this type have gone through the tp - agb phase . moreover , the orbital periods of the s - symbiotic systems are generally less than @xmath01000 days with circular orbits .",
    "interaction of these systems is via roche - lobe overflow .",
    "@xcite suggested that either the former agb star did not go through the tp - agb or its high metallicity hindered the efficiency of the s - process and the mass transfer during the tp - agb .",
    "the first possibility could apply to a small number of red symbiotic systems with low mass ( @xmath4 @xmath00.4 @xmath3 ) companions such as axper and cicyg .",
    "however , in order to account for the absence of the barium syndrome in systems like arpav ( @xmath4 @xmath01 @xmath3 ) or fn sgr ( @xmath5 @xmath00.7 @xmath3 ) the second possibility must be invoked ."
