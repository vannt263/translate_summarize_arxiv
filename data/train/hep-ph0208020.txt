    "in recent works @xcite a novel element , relevant in the study of qcd in the regge limit , has been defined and computed at the nlo level .",
    "it is the jet vertex , which represents one of the building blocks in the production of mueller - navelet jets  @xcite at hadron hadron colliders and of forward jets  @xcite in deep inelastic electron proton scattering .",
    "such processes should provide a kinematical environments for which the bfkl pomeron  @xcite qcd analysis could apply , since the transverse energy of the jet fixes a perturbative scale and the large energy yields a large rapidity interval .",
    "we briefly remember here that in a strong regge regime important contributions , or even dominant , come , in the perturbative language , from diagrams beyond nlo and nnlo at fixed order in @xmath1 .",
    "this is the main reason for considering a resummation of the leading and next - to - leading logarithmic contributions as computed in the bfkl pomeron framework .",
    "such approach is lacking of unitarity so that , if the related corrections are not taken into account , one must consider an upper bound on the energy to suppress them .",
    "it is already known that the ll analysis is not accurate enough  @xcite , being the kinematics selected by experimental cuts far from any asymptotic regime .",
    "moreover at this level of accuracy there is a maximal dependence in the different scales involved ( renormalization , collinear factorization and energy scales ) . for the mueller - navelet jet production process",
    "the only element still not known at the nlo level was the `` impact factor '' , which describes the hadron emitting one inclusive jet when interacting with the reggeized gluon which belongs to the bfkl ladder , accurate up to nll  @xcite .",
    "the jet vertex , now computed , is the building block of this interaction .",
    "for the so called forward jet production in dis the extra ingredient necessary is the photon impact factor , whose calculation is currently in progress  @xcite .",
    "let us also remind that nll bfkl approach has recently gained more theoretical solidity since the bootstrap condition in its strong form , which is the one necessary for the self - consistency of the assumption of reggeized form of the production amplitudes , has been stated  @xcite and formally proved  @xcite .",
    "this relation is a very remarkable property of qcd in the high energy limit .",
    "a particular theoretical challenge , interesting by itself and appearing in the calculation , is related to the special kinematics .",
    "the processes to be analyzed is illustrated in fig.[f : jet ] : the lower parton emitted from the hadron @xmath2 scatters with the upper parton @xmath3 and produces the jet @xmath4 .",
    "the gluon is hard , because of the large transverse momentum of the jet , and obeys the collinear factorization , i.e. its scale dependence is described by the dglap evolution equations @xcite . above the jet , on the other hand",
    ", the kinematics chosen requires a large rapidity gap between the jet and the outgoing parton @xmath3 : such a situation is described by bfkl dynamics . therefore the jet vertex lies at the interface between dglap and bfkl dynamics , a situation which appears for the first time in a non trivial way . as an essential result of our analysis we find that it is possible to separate , inside the jet vertex , the collinear infrared divergences that go into the parton evolution of the incoming gluon / quark from the high energy gluon radiation inside the rapidity gap which belongs to first rung of the lo bfkl ladder .",
    "let us consider the kinematic variables @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "in our analysis we study the partonic subprocess @xmath10 in the high energy limit @xmath11 according to the parton model , we assume the physical cross section to be given by the corresponding partonic cross section @xmath12 ( computable in perturbation theory ) convoluted with the parton distribution densities ( pdf ) @xmath13 of the partons",
    "@xmath14 inside the hadron @xmath2 .",
    "a jet distribution @xmath15 , with the usual safe infrared behaviour , selects the final states contributing to the one jet inclusive cross section that we are considering . in terms of the jet variables",
    " rapidity , transverse energy and azimuthal angle  the one jet inclusive cross section initiated by quarks and gluons in hadron @xmath2 can be written as @xmath16    one can easily see  @xcite that at the _ lowest order _ the jet cross section , dominated by a @xmath17-channel gluon exchange , can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the jet vertex induced by parton @xmath14 , @xmath20 is the partonic impact factor and @xmath21 is the parton distribution density ( pdf ) .",
    "the jet distribution is in this case trivial , @xmath22 with @xmath23 .    at the _",
    "nlo approximation _ virtual and real corrections enter in the calculation of the partonic cross section @xmath24 .",
    "the three partons produced in the real contributions , in the upper , and lower rapidity region are denoted by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , while the third , which can be emitted everywhere , by @xmath27 .",
    "moreover we shall call @xmath28 and @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "bold letters as before indicate the trasverse part .",
    "the infrared and ultraviolet divergences can be , as usual , treated by dimensional regularization ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "taking into account the i.r .",
    "properties of the jet distribution @xmath32 the following structure is matched exactly up to nlo ( i.e. @xmath33 )  @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the partonic impact factor correction in forward direction @xmath39 is well known  @xcite , the pdf s @xmath13 are the standard ones satisfying the lo dglap evolution equations and the bfkl green function @xmath40 is defined by the lo bfkl kernel @xmath41 .",
    "the new element is the correction to the jet vertex @xmath42 whose expression , for the quark and gluon initiated case , is given in  @xcite .",
    "another element , crucial in the derivation of the representation given above , is the energy scale @xmath43 associated to the bfkl rapidity evolution .",
    "the calculations show a natural choice , due to angular ordered preferred gluon emission and the presence of the jet defining distribution , which is also crucial to obtain the full collinear singularities which factorize into the pdf s .",
    "we give the expression of the jet vertex for the case @xmath44 .",
    "a mild modification of such a scale can be performed without introducing extra singularities , but in general this is not true . in any case",
    "using a different scale requires the introduction of modifing terms . for the symmetric regge type energy scale @xmath45",
    ", one has @xmath46 ( { { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ 1$}}}+{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{s}}}h_r),\\ ] ] where @xmath47 .    to obtain the jet cross section with accuracy up to nll terms",
    ", one has to consider the nll bfkl kernel @xmath48 , which has been computed with the scale @xmath45 . the corresponding green function , to be used in ( [ jetcrosssection ] ) ,",
    "is given by @xmath49^{-1}({{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ 1$}}}+{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{s}}}h_r)|{{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ k$}}}_2}\\rangle\\,.\\ ] ] the formula for the mueller - navelet jets  @xcite can be easily derived symmetrizing the formula ( [ jetcrosssection ] ) for the two jet case .",
    "the calculations at the nlo accuracy for the jet vertex which lies at the interface between dglap and bfkl dynamics are completed .",
    "therefore a phenomenological analysis of the mueller - navelet jets at nll is now possible .",
