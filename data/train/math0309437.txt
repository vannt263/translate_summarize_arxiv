    "in @xcite jaco and rubinstein pioneered the viewpoint that in triangulated 3-manifolds the normal surfaces of kneser @xcite are analogous to stable minimal surfaces .",
    "rubinstein pushed this idea further in @xcite by introducing _",
    "almost normal surfaces _ , the analogue of an unstable minimal surface of index one . guided by this analogy he showed that any strongly irreducible heegaard splitting can be isotoped to an almost normal surface .",
    "this was a crucial step in showing that in a non - haken 3-manifold there are at most a finite number of distinct heegaard splittings of a given genus @xcite , resolving a conjecture of waldhausen .",
    "in this paper we present a theory of _",
    "2-normal _ surfaces .",
    "a 2-normal surface is defined to be one which intersects every 3-simplex of a triangulated 3-manifold in normal triangles and quadrilaterals , with one or two exceptions .",
    "the possible exceptions are a pair of octagons , a pair of unknotted tubes , an octagon and a tube , or a 12-gon .",
    "( see theorem [ t : classify ] for a more precise definition . )",
    "this theory is guided by the viewpoint that 2-normal surfaces are analogous to unstable minimal surfaces of index two .",
    "we develop the theory of 2-normal surfaces by examining the interplay between  critical \" heegaard splittings and triangulations . _",
    "criticality _ was introduced in @xcite as a useful combinatorial condition on the compressing disks of a heegaard splitting , much like the condition of _ strong irreducibility _ @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we show the following :    [ t : nocrit ] suppose @xmath0 is an irreducible 3-manifold with no closed incompressible surfaces and at most one heegaard splitting ( up to isotopy ) of each genus .",
    "then @xmath0 does not contain a critical heegaard splitting .",
    "this shows that critical heegaard splittings are a non - trivial class of surfaces .",
    "what shows that they are an interesting class is the following :    [ t : mgcs ] suppose @xmath0 is a small 3-manifold whose boundary , if non - empty , is incompressible and @xmath1 and @xmath2 are distinct strongly irreducible heegaard splittings of @xmath0 which induce the same partition of @xmath3 .",
    "then the minimal genus common stabilization of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is critical .",
    "we begin this paper by defining what it means for a surface to be critical _ relative to a 1-manifold _ ( section [ s : relative ] ) and exploring some of the useful properties of such surfaces . when the 1-manifold in question is a suitable subset of the 1-skeleton of a triangulation",
    "we show that such surfaces are 2-normal ( section [ s : pl ] ) . in the remainder of the paper ( section [ s : exist ] ) we show that a critical heegaard surface can either be made critical or strongly irreducible relative to a given 1-manifold . by combining this machinery with theorem [ t : mgcs ]",
    "we obtain the main result of this paper :    * theorem [ t : main2 ] * _ the minimal genus common stabilization of any pair of strongly irreducible heegaard splittings of a non - haken 3-manifold is isotopic to an almost normal or 2-normal surface in any triangulation . _    at present it is not known whether or not there is an algorithm which will take two heegaard splittings and decide how many times one must stabilize one to obtain a stabilization of the other . any normal surface - type algorithm to do this would have to enumerate all possibilities for the minimal genus common stabilization of the two .",
    "the significance of theorem [ t : main2 ] is that it provides a framework for such an enumeration .    in developing the machinery necessary to prove theorem [ t : main2 ] we also prove the following interesting result :    * theorem [ t : almostnormalpair ] * _ let @xmath0 be a 3-manifold with traingulation @xmath4 and @xmath5 an embedded 3-ball in @xmath0 with normal boundary .",
    "suppose @xmath5 contains no vertices of the 0-skeleton of @xmath4 and the only normal 2-spheres in @xmath5 are copies of @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath5 contains two almost normal 2-spheres , each with an octagon , then @xmath5 contains a 2-normal 2-sphere with either two octagons or one 12-gon .",
    "_    this theorem asserts the existence of surfaces similar to those conjectured by rubinstein in his program to show that any action of @xmath7 on @xmath8 must be standard @xcite .",
    "note that the existence of an almost normal 2-sphere with octagon in any submanifold @xmath5 that satisfies the hypotheses is an important step in rubinstein s algorithm to recognize the 3-sphere @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "theorems [ t : almostnormalpair ] and [ t : main2 ] are further evidence that almost normal and 2-normal surfaces are the appropriate analogues of unstable minimal surfaces of indices one and two .",
    "one would expect that if one had distinct index one minimal surfaces then there should be an index two minimal surface .",
    "the analogue of this is precisely the assertion of the above theorems .      in this section",
    "we give definitions of some of the standard terms that will be used throughout the paper .",
    "the expert in 3-manifold theory can easily skip this .",
