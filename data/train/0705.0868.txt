    "mixtures of three - dimensional rod  like molecules have been analysed quite extensively , both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "beautiful experiments on molecular and colloidal particles have been reported , with the observation of different phases , such as isotropic and nematic phases of various kinds @xcite .",
    "of special interest is the issue of orientational phase transitions and , in particular , of entropically  driven phase segregation in these systems , a long  debated question in the context of hard spheres @xcite .",
    "there is now ample theoretical evidence for segregation and demixing phenomena in hard",
    " core mixtures of anisotropic particles @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting are segregation phenomena between two nematic phases , which sometimes show upper critical points @xcite .",
    "more recently , the occurrence and overall influence of spatially ordered phases , in the perfect ",
    "alignment approximation , have been analysed @xcite , and more complete studies , lifting the latter approximation , on the effect of layered phases and microsegregation phenomena in the phase behaviour have been carried out @xcite .",
    "studies on the corresponding two  dimensional mixtures are very scarce . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that two  dimensional isotropic mixtures of hard convex bodies can never demix within scaled  particle theory ( spt ) .",
    "a unimodal polydisperse mixture of hard needles was also studied within the onsager approach in ref .",
    "@xcite , one result being that the isotropic ",
    "nematic transition is always of second order .",
    "also , an equation of state for two  dimensional mixtures of hard bodies has been constructed starting from an approximation for their direct correlation functions @xcite ; it was found that demixing never occurs .",
    "finally , a theoretical study has recently been carried out for mixtures of hard rectangles and discorectangles within the framework of spt @xcite . using a bifurcation analysis ,",
    "demixing between different phases , one of which is an orientationally  ordered phase , was shown to occur .",
    "the analysis of this problem is sufficiently motivated by the importance of surface  phase transitions experienced by monolayers of adsorbed molecules .",
    "but , since the transition from the disordered phase to the oriented ( nematic ) phase in one  component fluids may be , and in most cases is , of second order in two dimensions , many new interesting features may arise in the phase diagram of the mixture , such as tricritical and critical end points , which are absent in three dimensions .",
    "our recent work on two  dimensional hard ",
    "rod fluids @xcite has demonstrated that these systems do in fact exhibit a richer phase behaviour , with the additional fact that , due to spatial restrictions , phase behaviour may be more sensitive to subtle effects associated with the particle geometrical shapes .",
    "it would be desirable to understand the differences and similarities between the two dimensionalities and elucidate their origin .",
    "in fact , liquid - crystalline phase transitions in one  component fluids depend strongly on dimensionality .",
    "a general trend of two  dimensional systems with continuous symmetry is the lack of true long  range order @xcite , which in a two  dimensional nematic would be reflected in the presence of quasi ",
    "long  range orientational order @xcite .",
    "thus , in the absence of any other mechanism , transitions from the isotropic phase ( i ) to the uniaxial nematic phase ( n@xmath0 ) in two  dimensional , one  component fluids of hard rods , may be governed by a disclination unbinding  type mechanism @xcite , as proposed by the kosterlitz ",
    "thouless ( kt ) theory @xcite ( in fluids of hard ellipses , for which simulations exist @xcite , the nature of the transition seems to depend on the aspect ratio @xcite ) .",
    "field theories , which can not account for these effects since collective fluctuations and the dynamics of topological defects are not properly ( or not at all ) described , predict continuous transitions of the usual ( mean  field ) type @xcite .",
    "however , the direct role played by dimensionality in two  dimensional mixtures may be of secondary importance as far as entropically - driven _ demixing _ transitions are concerned , since local entropic effects associated with packing may completely preempt kt  type effects ; in this sense , the mechanisms governing these systems could be intimately connected with those operating in the corresponding three  dimensional mixtures , which are described qualitatively correctly by mean  field theories of the density  functional type @xcite .    of particular interest",
    "is the case of hard rectangular particles , which might exhibit a so  called tetratic phase ( n@xmath1 ) in the one  component fluid @xcite .",
    "the tetratic phase possesses two equivalent directors pointing along mutually orthogonal directions ; it exhibits a symmetry higher than that of the particles making up the fluid .",
    "the nature of the transition from the i to the n@xmath1 phases is unknown , but density  functional studies predict it to be of second order @xcite .",
    "a recent bifurcation analysis @xcite , combined with further calculations which include three - body correlations @xcite , have not been conclusive as to the absolute thermodynamic stability of the tetratic phase with respect to phases with spatial order , although preliminary computer simulations @xcite seem to support the tetratic phase as an intermediate phase between the isotropic phase and the crystalline phase , at least for aspect ratios less than @xmath2@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , questions remain as to the maximum aspect ratio that can support tetratic order ( for example , experiments on -non ",
    "equilibrium vibrated monolayers of granular particles @xcite extend it up to @xmath4 ) , the interplay between the n@xmath1 and the usual uniaxial nematic phase n@xmath0 ( possessing only one director or alternatively two non  equivalent directors ) , or the role played by the nature of the crystalline tetratic phase ( with an aperiodic solid being the most promising candidate @xcite ) .",
    "finally , recent work @xcite has shown the ability of these particles to promote spatial order when confined between parallel one  dimensional plates , with potentially interesting applications as building blocks for self  assembly .",
    "the role played by tetratic order in mixtures where one of the components consists of hard squares or rectangles , while the other may or may not promote this order , is the aim of the present paper .",
    "we investigate the phase behaviour of mixtures of hard squares or hard rectangles with other particles of different geometry .",
    "the ability of hard rectangles to induce either short or long  range tetratic order originates from the sharp corners of their shape ( here we do not address the question on the existence of true long  range order of nematic correlations in these systems ) . rectangles with low aspect ratio @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 their length and @xmath7 their breadth ) may orient along either a particular direction or the orthogonal direction equally easily without hampering packing efficiency , and a tetratic phase results . for larger aspect ratios ,",
    "hard rectangles stabilise into the usual uniaxial nematic .",
    "hard - rod particles terminated by a semicircle ( such as a disco  rectangle ) do not pack efficiently in a tetratic arrangement , and can only form one ( uniaxial ) nematic phase .",
    "when these two types of particles , or when two types of hard rectangles , one exhibiting a tetratic phase which is not present in the other , mix together , the tetratic order induced by one component survives , at higher pressures , in some range of particle volume ( area ) fractions , with an extent that depends on the geometrical compatibility between species .",
    "nematic demixing occurs , and the resulting phase diagrams show a rich variety of features , such as phase transitions of different order , triple , critical , tricritical , azeotropic and critical end points .",
    "a particular situation is when hard squares of different particle area are mixed .",
    "a consensus is now beginning to emerge that entropy - driven demixing in additive hard ",
    "sphere mixtures involves spatially non  uniform phases @xcite .",
    "the current situation concerning mixtures of _ parallel _",
    "( i.e. with frozen orientational degrees of freedom ) hard cubes looks very similar @xcite .",
    "now , despite initial evidence based on simulation that no demixing occurs in a mixture of parallel hard squares on a lattice @xcite , supported by off  lattice density  functional calculations on the fluid phase @xcite , recent simulation work gives evidence for demixing involving an inhomogeneous phase @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our calculations , which incorporate orientational degrees of freedom ( though , admittedtly , do not contemplate inhomogeneous phases ) , show demixing involving two fluid phases , at least one of which is oriented ( with an island of instability in the phase diagram and sometimes with an associated upper critical point ) , when the size ratio is sufficient large , while the completely isotropic mixture does not exhibit segregation . clearly our results demand for additional computer simulations on the freely  rotating hard  square model , which have not been reported yet .    after presenting a brief summary of the theoretical approach , which is a density  functional theory based on the spt approximation",
    ", we present the results and conclude with a summary and some final remarks .",
    "the appendix presents some details on the calculation of spinodal lines and tricritical points .",
    "let us first briefly recall the theoretical model used and the approximations implemented .",
    "the model is based on the spt approximation for two - dimensional binary mixtures , first applied in three  dimensions by cotter and wacker @xcite .",

    "order terms in @xmath34 , @xmath44 which appear as quadratic terms in the free energy , are treated exactly . however , binodal lines and tricritical points are affected by the parameterisation , since their location depend on higher  order terms in @xmath39 .",

    "we divide the presentation by first showing results for different mixtures containing squares and discs , followed by mixtures of hard rods ( rectangles and discorectangles ) . in the following",
    "we will generally use the following acronyms for the different particles : hs ( hard squares ) , hd ( hard discs ) , hr ( hard rectangles ) and hdr ( hard discorectangles ) .",
    "the fluid of freely  rotating hard squares has been studied by monte carlo simulations @xcite , with indications that a tetratic phase might be stable prior to crystallisation .",
    "on the other hand , mixtures of hard squares have been analysed by computer simulations @xcite and density  functional theory @xcite in the approximation of perfect orientational order .",
    "indications that there is no demixing in this system @xcite were later challenged by evidence for a spinodal line from monte carlo simulation @xcite ; the demixing transition involves a fluid phase and a phase with big squares in close  packed aggregates .",
    "since orientational disorder may be important for these mixtures , we believe it is of interest to address this problem with the spt approximation , where orientational disorder is allowed ( obviously our approach can only search for demixing behaviour involving fluid , either isotropic or tetratic , phases ) .    the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] correspond to a mixture of freely ",

    "order i  n@xmath1 phase transitions at reduced pressure @xmath47 ( here @xmath48 is the particle proper area ) .",
    "note that , for squares , a uniaxial nematic phase is not possible by construction .",
    "for the mixture , the only possible ( fluid ) phases are also the i and n@xmath1 phases",
    ". remarkably , the mixture exhibits segregation between two tetratic phases with different area fractions occupied by the two components .",
    "the region of demixing is a closed loop bounded above ( below ) by an upper ( lower ) critical point ( in fact , since the i ",
    "n@xmath1 spinodal line crosses the demixing region see inset showing schematic topology , segregation mostly proceeds between i and n@xmath1 phases ) .",
    "since mixtures of perfectly parallel hard squares do not demix it is surprising that , in this mixture , orientational disorder induces demixing .",
    "closed loops of immiscibility have been predicted in mixtures of hard rods in the onsager approximation @xcite ( see however ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and also in fluids of parallel hard rods @xcite , both in three dimensions .",
    "our calculations show that they are also a property of some two  dimensional mixtures . in our case demixing",
    "occurs at fairly low values of composition ; this is easy to explain since we expect segregation to take place when the volume fraction of both components are approximately equal , @xmath49 , which implies that segregation will occur for @xmath50 .",
    "as the size ratio of the squares decreases , the island of immiscibility diminishes , and we are eventually left with a second  order i ",
    "n@xmath1 transition in the whole composition interval .",
    "the demixing island disappears when the size ratio is equal to @xmath51 ( see appendix ) .",
    "the mechanism underlying n@xmath1n@xmath1 demixing is different for the upper and lower parts of the demixing island . as is well known , demixing and ordering phenomena in mixtures of hard anisotropic particles result from the competition of entropies of different origin : mixing , orientational and excluded  volume entropies . in the transition from the isotropic to the nematic phase the last two terms compete . in mixtures ,",
    "the excluded ",
    "volume entropy has contributions from the two species and from the unlike  particle interactions .",
    "the mechanism explaining the lower n@xmath1n@xmath1 segregation phenomena in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is the classical one : the balance between mixing entropy and the excluded",
    " volume term of unlike species , which counterbalances the tendency toward mixing of the former .",
    "however , the upper n@xmath1n@xmath1 segregation region has a different origin , since here orientational entropy plays a role .",
    "this might have been suspected a priori , since in the limit of perfect order ( parallel squares ) no demixing occurs . at sufficiently high pressures in the freely  rotating fluid , sufficiently near the close  packed limit",
    ", the orientational order is almost saturated and can no longer compete with the other terms , so that no demixing is expected .",
    "as pressure is reduced , orientational entropy begins to play a role and in fact the contribution from the small squares is the driving force toward demixing .    for the size ratio shown ( 1:10 ) ,",
    "two critical end points , indicated in the figure by filled circles , appear in the phase diagram , defined by the points where the i ",
    "n@xmath1 spinodal line crosses the demixing region ; the location of these points , given by @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , can be approximated from the set of candidates to tricritical points obtained by means of a bifurcation analysis ( here and in what follows , numerical values for the location of tricritical and points should be understood to result from rigorous bifurcation analysis of the free  energy functional , and may in some cases be at variance with those obtained from the variational minimisation , on which all the phase diagrams presented are based ; see appendix for details on the bifurcation analysis ) . as the size ratio is diminished , first the upper critical point disappears , and the upper critical end point becomes a tricritical point ; then the lower critical end point becomes a tricritical point , and the lower critical point also disappears , leaving two tricritical points before the whole demixing region vanishes .",
    "the lower critical point always stays within the n@xmath1 region ( i.e. no i ",
    "i demixing is observed ) , .",
    "demixing in this mixture is therefore associated with a symmetry  breaking phase , the tetratic phase .",
    "there are strong arguments @xcite disallowing demixing in the i phase ( within the context of the spt approach ) .",
    "this would not necessarily imply that demixing is completely ruled out in the rotationally ",
    "symmetric i phase of hard ",
    "square mixtures or mixtures of particles with different geometries , but a more sophisticated theory , incorporating exact higher  order virial coefficients ( which are known to be important for two  dimensional hard convex bodies ) , would be necessary to settle this point .      fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the phase diagram corresponding to a mixture of hard discs and squares ( the diameter of the former being equal to the side length of the latter ) . here",
    "only one of the components ( the squares ) has tetratic order . by choosing the particle areas of both species to be approximately equal ( the ratio being @xmath56 ) we focus on the role of particle geometry . in this mixture",
    "we find that the n@xmath1 phase exhibited by the pure system of squares survives up to a maximum concentration of discs of @xmath57 ( this corresponds to an area ratio approximately equal to @xmath58 ) .",
    "complete demixing occurs at high pressure , while the i  n@xmath1 transition becomes of second order below a tricritical point , located at @xmath59 , @xmath60 ( see appendix ) .",
    "fractionation becomes stronger as pressure is increased , since excluded  volume considerations are increasingly important in this limit : geometrical mismatch ( given by the unlike disc - square interaction ) grossly counterbalances mixing entropy , inducing strong segregation .",
    "hard rectangles have been predicted to exhibit a phase with tetratic order when their aspect ratio is sufficiently low @xcite .",
    "tetratic order is enhanced as the aspect ratio of the rectangles is decreased .",
    "however there is some uncertainty as to the critical value of @xmath61 beyond which the tetratic phase is no longer possible ; the spt approach indicates that for @xmath62 the stable nematic phase is the tetratic nematic @xcite ( as mentioned in the introduction , computer simulations indicate that this value may be much larger , in the range @xmath2@xmath3 ) .",
    "in contrast , a fluid of hard discorectangles can only support a uniaxial nematic phase @xcite .",
    "in previous work @xcite we analysed possible demixing scenarios of mixtures of hard rectangles ( hr ) and mixtures of hard discorectangles ( hdr ) , using the same spt theory . in this section",
    "we further investigate this problem by considering a wider range of mixtures , in particular , _ crossed _ mixtures ( i.e. mixtures consisting of hr and hdr particles ) ; the effect of particle geometry is an aspect that can be assessed in a very direct way by analysing crossed mixtures , as well as the role played by the tetratic phase against the standard uniaxial nematic phase when particles of different geometries are mixed .",
    "results will be presented by means of phase diagrams including , not only spinodal lines , but also binodal lines when present .    in the following we first consider mixtures of hard rods , one of which can be stabilised into a tetratic phase ( i.e. hr particles with aspect ratio @xmath62 ) while the other can not ( i.e. either hr particles with @xmath63 , or hdr particles ) .",
    "we intend to understand how the tetratic phase is destabilised by the geometrical mismatch of the particles .",
    "the first mixture that we consider is a mixture of hr and hdr particles , both with @xmath64 [ in the latter case the aspect ratio parameter is defined as @xmath65 .",
    "also , the same particle areas have been chosen for both types of particles , in an attempt to single out features of phase behaviour mainly driven by differences in particle geometry .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . at high pressure",
    "a demixing region occurs between two uniaxial nematic phases ( i.e. there is n@xmath0n@xmath0 demixing ) , bounded by a lower critical point .",
    "fractionation becomes stronger as pressure increases , an effect ultimately associated with the slight difference in particle geometry , which penalises the mixed state due to unfavourable packing between dissimilar particles ; this arises from the circular caps of the hdr particles . at lower pressure",
    "there is a transition between the isotropic and the uniaxial nematic phases , which occurs via a first  order phase transition with small fractionation .",
    "the phase diagram is of the azeotropic type : an azeotropic point ( no fractionation ) appears at @xmath66 , with an associated ( small ) pressure range where the n@xmath0 phase is reentrant . since the hr component of the mixture possesses a stable tetratic phase , an island of tetratic order exists for high values of @xmath16 , separated from the isotropic phase via a second  order phase transition and from the uniaxial nematic via a first ",
    "order transition ( of course this is also the case for the pure hr fluid , @xmath67 ) .",
    "the island of n@xmath1 stability is very small ; for a hr fluid with @xmath64 , the range of pressures where the tetratic phase is stable is small @xcite but , in addition , tetratic order is easily destroyed when adding to the mixture particles that do not conform with tetratic symmetry .",
    "next we consider two different mixtures that represent slight variations with respect to the previous mixture . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we analyse a hr / hdr mixture , where the hr component has been shortened to an aspect ratio of @xmath68 , keeping the breadth to the same value , while the hdr component still has @xmath69 but the particle area is made equal to that of the hr particle of the previous mixture .",
    "essentially we would like to analyse the effect of shortening the hard  rectangle component in the previous mixture ( while at the same time reducing its particle area by @xmath70 ) with the aim of increasing the strength of tetratic ordering . since the tetratic phase of the one  component hr fluid is much more stable , the tetratic phase in the mixture stabilises into a larger range of compositions .",
    "the diagram is topologically equivalent to that in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , except that the critical end point in the i ",

    "non  trivial changes are obtained if the mixture of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is changed by shortening the hdr particle down to an aspect ratio of @xmath71 while the particle area is made equal to that of a hr particle of aspect ratio 1.5 and unit breadth ; as a result , the nematic phase of the one  component hdr fluid appears at a much higher pressure .",
    "the phase diagram is presented in fig .",
    "this phase diagram can be regarded as a continuation of that in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] where the n@xmath0n@xmath0 demixing region and the i ",

    "the breadth of all particles will be taken to be unity , and we change the length or , equivalently , the aspect ratio .",
    "three cases are considered : ( i ) @xmath72 , @xmath73 , so that none of the components exhibits tetratic symmetry ; ( ii ) @xmath74 , @xmath71 , with both species having tetratic phases ; and ( iii ) @xmath75 in the range @xmath76@xmath77 , @xmath69 , so that only the second species can stabilise into a tetratic phase .",

    "the aspect ratios of the two components of mixture ( ii ) , @xmath74 and @xmath71 , were chosen such that both possess a stable tetratic phase .",
    "this requires their values to be very similar ; therefore , no demixing occurs ( fig . [ fig7 ] ) , and a relatively featureless phase diagram results .",
    "finally , in mixture ( iii ) , the shorter component exhibits a tetratic phase that propagates from the @xmath80 axis into finite values of composition when the longer component is added ; however , due to the considerable difference in lengths between the two species , the n@xmath1 phase does not survive very much as a function of composition ; in fact , the region of tetratic stability can hardly be seen in the phase diagram , fig .",

    "there is a large demixing region which , as the particle aspect ratio of the first component is increased ( from @xmath76 to @xmath77 ) , expands considerably .",

    "therefore , in some range of parameters two n@xmath0n@xmath0 coexistence regions can be found , with upper and lower critical points .",
    "these two regions merge as @xmath75 increases , giving rise to a very large demixing region .",
    "to conclude , we have analysed the phase behaviour of mixtures of two - dimensional hard rods , using the scaled  particle theory approximation .",
    "we have particularly concentrated on mixtures containing hard rectangles as one of the components , with the other being a hard discorectangle , what we have called _ crossed _ mixtures .",
    "the geometry of hard rectangles allows for a tetratic phase to be stabilised ; addition of a second component which does not support this symmetry obviously tends to destroy tetratic order but , when the particle areas of both components are not very dissimilar and the pure fluid of hard rectangles strongly stabilises the tetratic phase ( i.e. when their aspect ratio is relatively low ) , tetratic order may survive even for large area fractions of the non  tetratic  forming component .",
    "the case of a mixture of hard rectangles , one with tetratic order and the other without , shows the same trends .    as a special case",
    "we have also considered mixtures of hard squares , and found that these mixtures do exhibit nematic demixing , contrary to the case where rotational degrees of freedom are frozen ; in the latter case the mixture never segregates into two fluid phases ( though simulations seem to point to segregation between fluid and non - uniform phases ) , while in the former there is a critical size ratio ( 1:4 ) above which there is segregation .",
    "this is a remarkable case where orientational _ disorder _ induces entropy  driven demixing ( i.e. _ mixing order _ ) .",
    "inclusion of non - uniform phases in our theoretical analysis would certainly be interesting and is left for future work .",
    "growing evidence indicates that demixing in additive hard ",
    "core mixtures always involves at least one inhomogenous phase .",
    "an interesting possibility is that freely  rotating hard",
    " core mixtures ( which can be viewed as a special case of non  additive mixture ) may in some cases segregate into two fluid phases , provided nematic phases are involved ; it could be that some type of symmetry breaking , either positional or orientational , is required for demixing to occur .    in general , phase diagrams of two  dimensional hard",
    " rod particles closely resemble those of three - dimensional mixtures , save the fact that the isotropic ",
    "nematic transition in two dimensions may be ( and actually is in most cases ) of second order , which adds an element of complexity to the corresponding phase diagrams .",
    "nematic demixing generally occurs in these systems and , for sufficiently large size ratios between the components , demixing competes with the isotropic ",
    "nematic ( either uniaxial or tetratic ) transition .",
    "entropic effects due to balance between excluded - volume interactions of like and unlike components and mixing entropy produce strong fractionation .",
    "these effects probably counteract collective fluctuations leading to kt - type behaviour ; for example , within our mean  field density  functional treatment , the continuous isotropic ",
    "nematic transition of the one  component fluid generally continues as a critical transition in the mixture , but sooner or later , beyond some value of particle composition , a demixing ( first  order ) transition is met via a tricritical point or otherwise ( critical end point ) .",
    "however , the true nature of the isotropic ",
    "nematic transition in these mixtures , and of the uniaxial and tetratic nematic phases themselves ( i.e. whether they possess true or quasi  long range order ) is an issue that should be investigated by means of detailed computer simulations and possibly also by experiments on vibrated monolayers .    in this work",
    "we have not considered spatially  ordered phases , such as smectic , columnar or crystalline .",
    "certainly some of these phases will appear at some pressure , and probably some of the phase behaviour shown for the mixtures considered will be preempted by these phases .",
    "more sophisticated density  functional treatments are required to assess this point ; some proposals have already been done for one  component two  dimensional hard  rod systems @xcite , but even the consequences of these approaches have not been explored yet ; this will be the subject of future work @xcite .",
