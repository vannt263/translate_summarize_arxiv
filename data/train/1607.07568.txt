    "it would not be exaggerated if we said that the most important property of an eas is arrival direction .",
    "as well , the first step of reconstructing an eas is estimation of arrival direction .",
    "eas arrival direction is fundamental for reconstructing the core location and , more importantly , for determination of its energy . on the other hand ,",
    "arrival direction mis - estimation results in systematic error of other reconstructed parameters of an eas .",
    "+ the most common method for finding the arrival direction of an eas is a fit of recorded arrival times , @xmath0s , to the expected arrival times , @xmath1s , which is performed by minimization of the following equation : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of triggered detectors ( td ) of the array during an eas event and @xmath4 is the weight which is assigned to the @xmath5th td .",
    "usually @xmath6 is a plane , a cone with a fixed cone slope , a cone with a variable cone slope that is taken as a fit parameter , or a plane with curvature correction .",
    "+ the simplest functional form of @xmath6 is a plane wave front with light speed ( plane front approximation ( pfa ) ) .",
    "this plane is represented by the following equation : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a unitary vector in the direction of axis of eas , @xmath9 is the position of an arbitrary point on the plane , and @xmath10 is the time of arrival of eass forward front to this point .",
    "we should only find 3 independent constants ( e.g. @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath10 ) which can be seen better , if we rewrite equation as follows : @xmath13 where @xmath9 is replaced with the coordinates of origin , @xmath14 .",
    "now , the @xmath15 function can be written as : @xmath16 under the constraint of @xmath17 .",
    "+ sometimes , all weights are taken as @xmath18 . in these situations ,",
    "summation does not often include all tds .",
    "for example , summation is performed among a few tds around the one recording the largest number of particles @xcite . + in some other cases , the thickness of eas front is considered and the weights are taken as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the thickness of eas in the location of @xmath5th detector @xcite .",
    "@xcite established empirically that:@xmath21 with the @xmath22 , distance of @xmath5th detector to the core location measured in meters .",
    "when a detector detects more than one particle , the above equation should be divided by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the number of detected particles in @xmath5th detector .",
    "+ some authors prefer to consider the front of an eas as a cone with a fixed cone slope @xcite . assuming a conical front",
    ", the equation changes as follows : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the eas cone slope and @xmath27 is the transverse distance of @xmath5th detector from the eas axis . +",
    "another possible treatment is to take the cone slope a function of eas other properties ( e.g. a function of zenith angle @xcite ) . in these circumstances , at first , the eas parameters should be found with an initial crude estimation ( e.g. arrival direction with a pfa with all @xmath4 taken as 1 ) .",
    "a further option is to take the slope of cone as an additional fit parameter ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ all of the above methods of reconstructing the arrival direction of an eas have in common minimization of a multivariable function . with the exception of the special case of a simple pfa where all @xmath4 are taken constant and whose minimization can be done analytically ,",
    "all other techniques need a numerical minimization which is time - consuming and does not have a unique solution .",
    "also , numerical minimization require a first guess for the desired parameters and because of the inherent complexity of minimization methods for a multivariable function , may not converge to a solution . also , the same methods are partly dependent on the precision of the predicted shape of eas front curvature or its thickness , and so are model - dependent .",
    "+ some of the algorithms used in the literature are model - independent and also do not make use of a minimization procedure , but are restricted to a specific array or a specific category of arrays @xcite . as an example , @xcite developed a fast gradient method which does not need a minimization procedure , but can only be used for large eass detected in a square network array .",
    "+ in what follows , we introduce a new arrival direction reconstruction algorithm which does not need a numerical optimization procedure and therefore is fast and stable in comparison to the above - mentioned common algorithms .",
    "this method is general , in the sense that is not restricted to a special category of surface arrays .",
    "it is also relatively accurate .",
    "this method is based on a recently introduced method for reconstructing the core location of an eas , named simefic ii @xcite .",
    "the algorithm which is presented in the next section has been developed and tested for an assumed array whose detectors and layout have been described in detail in @xcite . in short ,",
    "it is a symmetric square array with @xmath28 detectors and an array constant of 10 m. the length of each side of the array is 200 m. + 400000 corsika @xcite simulated eass whose characteristics ( primary particle types , energy range of primaries , and etc ) are the same as section 3 of paper @xcite have been used . in all simulations ,",
    "eass true core locations move on the diagonal line of the array @xmath29 , from the center of the array , @xmath30 , to its corner , @xmath31 , by steps of @xmath32 .",
    "+ in order to estimate the error which has been occurred in the arrival direction reconstruction of an eas , we find the angular distance of the true arrival direction provided by corsika , @xmath33 , from the reconstructed arrival direction , @xmath34 : @xmath35",
    "as already mentioned , @xcite gradient method is an arrival direction reconstruction technique which does not need any optimization procedure and so is stable and fast . in this method , for every grid point of the array ( position of all detectors of the array ) ,",
    "an arrival time gradient is calculated which depends to the time of those detectors which are nearest to that grid point along two perpendicular directions ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 directions ) .",
    "each grid point which does not have a td in one of its four main directions , is discarded from calculations . then a weight which depends on pulse heights and distances of the nearest chosen detectors from others along each direction to that grid point",
    "is assigned . at last ,",
    "a weighted averaging is done ( for @xmath36 and @xmath37 directions ) whose results are directly related to the direction cosines of the eas .",
    "+ one of the most striking ideas of the mayer gradient method is that the average of gradients can compensate for the conical shape of eas front around the axis of eas .",
    "this procedure also reduces that contribution of arrival direction error which is the result of stochastic fluctuation of arrival times .",
    "however , it has two main disadvantages : first , it is only applicable to square grid arrays ( whose most detectors have some other neighbouring detectors along two perpendicular directions ) .",
    "second , for each grid point , it is not clear why we do not use arrival time information of the same grid point ( if the detector of that grid point is triggered ) . + in what follows",
    ", a new technique is introduced which has the benefits of the mayer gradient method , but does not have its disadvantages . instead of finding the arrival time gradient in each grid point , we find a unit vector ( direction vector ( dv ) ) in the approximate arrival direction of the eas for each td .",
    "then , a weighted averaging will be done among all of these dvs .",
    "same as mayer gradient method , averaging can reduce the systematic error in arrival direction due to the conical shape of an eas and the stochastic error which is the result of fluctuations in arrival times .      for each td",
    ", the dv can be found using its arrival time information and the arrival time information of a few other detectors of the array ( see below for the selection rule of other detectors ) .",
    "this task can be accomplished with a simple pfa whose equations for a horizontal flat detector array are explicitly represented here for reference .",
    "+ assume we want to find dv for @xmath38 tds of a horizontal flat detector array . in this case , the equation [ eq : chi2plane ] is changed as follows : @xmath39 where we are looking for @xmath11 and @xmath12 . since dv is a unit vector , the third component @xmath40 ( apart from very rare upward eass , @xmath41 is always positive ) . for finding @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    ", we should solve the following system of equations simultaneously : @xmath42 solutions of the above system of equations are : @xmath43 where : @xmath44 and so on .",
    "+ on some exceptional occasions the @xmath45 , so we must put such data aside .",
    "the reason for this incident is that a plane with a speed of light can not be fit to the time data of detectors .      here ,",
    "two questions arise : how should we choose some other tds around a td for finding dv of the same td , and how can we assign a weight to this dv ?",
    "+ near core location , eas front is flatter , and random arrival time fluctuation is smaller than other regions .",
    "so , the arrival time information of a td which is closer to the core location is more reliable than that of detectors which are far from the core location .",
    "two other decisive factors for reliability of a detector time information in comparison with others during an event are the high number of detected particles in that detector and its short relative distance from other detectors with high density of detected particles .",
    "all above - mentioned criteria are included in the weights provided by simefic ii for tds .",
    "simefic ii method which can reconstruct the core location of an eas with a good precision , assigns a weight to each td of the array .",
    "these weights are defined as @xmath46 ( for further information see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "based on these weights , the following algorithm is proposed :    1 .",
    "assume we have @xmath3 tds during an eas event . using a pfa (",
    "all @xmath4s taken as 1 ) , we find the first approximation of the arrival direction of the eas @xmath47 . then , using @xmath47 as inputs of simefic ii , we find simefic ii weights for each td of the array .",
    "we sort tds according to their simefic ii weights ( from now on @xmath4s are simefic ii weights ) , from the highest one ( @xmath48 ) to the lowest one ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "3 .   using the first @xmath38 highest weighted detectors time information",
    ", we find a dv and assign it to the @xmath50st highest weighted detector with the weight @xmath48 . then we eliminate the @xmath50st detector from the list of detectors .",
    "4 .   for each remaining @xmath51 tds , we repeat the last step one by one . at",
    "last we have @xmath52 dvs and their related weights .",
    "5 .   after finding dv for each td of the array ,",
    "the reconstructed arrival direction of the eas can be found from : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is dv of the @xmath5th td of the array .    because we use simefic weights ,",
    "the method is named simefic arrival direction ( simad ) .",
    "the last thing which should be noted is that the number of selected tds for finding each dv , @xmath38 , should be optimized by trial and error .",
    "for finding the normal vector of a plane , it is necessary to have three points on it .",
    "so , the smallest possible value for @xmath38 is 3 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the results of simad ( @xmath55 ) and the results of a simple pfa ( with @xmath18 for all tds ) . as can be seen , it has far better results than pfa .",
    "a typical detector of a surface array with the average spacing of about @xmath56 m between detectors has a time resolution of @xmath57 ns ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a sophisticated detector of such an array has a time resolution of better than 1 ns ( e.g. @xcite ) . in order to check the precision of the simad algorithm against detectors limited time resolution",
    ", a normally distributed random number with an average of 0 and a standard deviation of @xmath58 ns was added to each particle arrival time .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the effect of this time error on the results of simad ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "as can be seen , accuracy is substantially decreased by adding this time error .",
    "the reason of this behavior is not too complicated .",
    "when we find the normal vector of a plane with only 3 points on it , an uncertainty of about @xmath59 m for the positions of each point ( assuming that each particle s speed is the speed of light , @xmath58 ns , uncertainty results in @xmath59 m of position error ) leads to a large uncertainty in the direction of the plane s normal vector , especially when those points are near each other ( whathas occurred for the near core location s detectors with high weights ) . + iin order to reduce the effect of this time error , we should increase the @xmath38 value . increasing",
    "the amount of @xmath38 could reduce random fluctuations , because this action can play the role of an averaging with more data which reduces random error .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the results of increasing the amount of @xmath38 on accuracy of the simad method .",
    "as you can see in this figure , with increasing the amount of @xmath38 , the accuracy of simad for data with @xmath58 ns time error becomes better than pfa for data without time error .",
    "especially , for @xmath60 , accuracy of simad is the same as that of pfa in the central region , and is far better than pfa in peripheral regions .",
    "in previous section we saw that simad is superior to a simple pfa ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "let us compare simad with a more sophisticated method of arrival direction reconstruction than the simple pfa .",
    "a more sophisticated technique is pfa with thickness correction ( pfawtc ) . for the thickness of an eas , @xmath62",
    ", we use linsley approximation , equation . in order to obtain better accuracy for pfawtc , in equation ,",
    "@xmath22 is taken as the distance of @xmath5th td from the true axis location provided by corsika , @xmath63 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the location of @xmath5th td and @xmath66 are the true angles of the arrival direction of eas ( again provided by corsika ) .",
    "also , data without time error are used .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the results of pfawtc ( in its ideal conditions ) in comparison with pfa and simad ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "for pfa , data without time error are used again . for simad ,",
    "data with 5 ns time error are used . as can be seen in this figure , pfawtc is superior to pfa in all regions of the array .",
    "it also has better results than simad in the central area .",
    "however , simad performs better in peripheral regions .",
    "so far , we have used the same amount of @xmath38 for all eass , regardless of their sizes .",
    "it seems that for an eas event with more tds , the amount of @xmath38 should be higher in comparison with another eas event with less tds .",
    "therefore , it will be better if @xmath38 depends on the number of tds , @xmath3 .",
    "+ figure [ fig5 ] shows the results of simad for those amounts of @xmath38 which are proportional to the @xmath3 .",
    "it is easy to see that increasing to some extent the amount of @xmath38 proportional to @xmath3 , results in better precision of simad . as is evident from the top part of the figure , results of simad ( @xmath67 )",
    "are the same as or better than those of simad ( @xmath68 ) on all parts of the array .",
    "obviously the bottom part of the figure shows that simad ( @xmath69 ) has a better accuracy than pfawtc in all parts of the array .",
    "also , in the same part of this figure , the results of pfawtc for data with 5 ns time error are shown . both simads ( @xmath67 and @xmath69 ) have better results than pfawtc for data with time error in all regions of the array .",
    "as may be seen from the bottom part of the figure , even better results are possible if we use different amounts of @xmath38 in different regions of the array . up to 100 m away from the array center ,",
    "the precision of simad is about @xmath70 .",
    "also , it has a better angular resolution than @xmath71 in the marginal part of the array .",
    "in this paper , a new technique named simad for reconstructing the arrival direction of an eas has been developed .",
    "this method does not assume anything about the shape of an eas front or its thickness .",
    "this technique is based on finding a local arrival direction , dv , and a special weight ( provided by simefic method ) for each td of an array .",
    "the local arrival direction for a td is found by fitting a plane to arrival times of the same td and some other tds around it .",
    "the weighted average direction of all tds is a vector whose components are direction cosines of an eas arrival direction . + simad has a high angular resolution , especially in marginal parts of an array where other methods do not often have satisfactory precision .",
    "also , it has at least the same accuracy of sophisticated methods in the central part of an array . + it should be noted that simad is now in its initial version and should be optimized against different parameters and also for any other type of arrays ; a few examples : weights may be not in their most optimized form ; selection of some tds for finding a local arrival direction could be improved ; maybe finding a dv could be performed via some other approach ; etc .",
    "although the structure of simad is general and is not dependent on a special kind of array , it should be tested and optimized for other arrays before utilizing in eass data analysis .",
    "+ the last point which should be insisted is that the most important advantage of simad in comparison with other methods is its model - independence , so it can be used to improve other techniques of arrival direction estimation ."
