    "the topic of the present paper is the numerical analysis of _ quasilinear wave equations_. such wave equations show up in a variety of applications , ranging from elastodynamics to general relativity . while the ( local - in - time ) analysis of them is well - developed since the seventies , the papers @xcite by kato and @xcite by hughes , kato & marsden being major contributions to the local well - posedness theory , and has meanwhile found its way into classical monographs on partial differential equation , see , for instance , the monograph @xcite by taylor , as well as the books by sogge @xcite and hrmander @xcite , the numerical analysis of quasilinear wave equations is much less developed .",
    "the main challenge is , of course , the numerical treatment of the quasilinear term in the equation .    in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on quasilinear wave equations of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are smooth and real - valued functions such that @xmath3 .",
    "we consider real - valued solutions to with @xmath4-periodic boundary conditions in one space dimension , @xmath5 , for initial values @xmath6 given at time @xmath7 .",
    "the real - valued parameter @xmath8 will be used to emphasize the strength of the nonlinearities , and we will be interested both in the regime where @xmath8 is small so that the nonlinearities are small and the regime where @xmath8 is of order one .",
    "quasilinear wave equations of this form with small @xmath9 have been extensively studied by groves & schneider @xcite , chong & schneider @xcite , chirilus - bruckner , dll & schneider @xcite and dll @xcite : the equations from the class are prototypes for models in nonlinear optics with a nonlinear schrdinger equation as a modulation equation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* introduction ) .",
    "many examples from elasticity and fluid mechanics can also be reduced to quasilinear wave equations under the form .",
    "relevant applications from elasticity and general relativity appear in @xcite for instance , though of course many of the most physically interesting examples occur in dimensions @xmath10 and include potential dependence upon @xmath11 in @xmath2 and possible dependence upon @xmath12 . using the techniques developed here to study smooth solutions in relevant higher dimensional models will be a topic for future work and would likely require some higher regularity assumptions on the solutions .",
    "the principal difficulty in the numerical discretization of is the quasilinear term @xmath13 . for typical explicit methods for the discretization in time ,",
    "in which the numerical approximation at a discrete time depends in an explicit way on this quasilinear term at some previous time step , there is a risk of _ losing derivatives _ , in the sense that a control of a certain number of spatial derivatives of the numerical solution requires the control of _ more _ derivatives of the numerical solution at previous time steps .",
    "this phenomenon is by far not restricted to quasilinear wave equations , and an established way to prevent a loss of derivatives is to resort to carefully chosen implicit methods . in the case of quasilinear wave equations",
    ", this route has been taken recently by hochbruck & paur @xcite and kovcs & lubich @xcite , who propose and study implicit and semi - implicit methods of runge  kutta type in absence of a discretization in space for a more general class of quasilinear evolution equations . in the present paper , we take another route and show how a class of _ explicit _ time discretizations can be used to numerically solve the quasilinear wave equation ( and also how it can be combined with a fourier spectral method in space ) .",
    "the considered class of methods is the class of _ trigonometric integrators _ , which is described in detail in section [ sec - method ] .",
    "these methods are exponential integrators and have been originally developed for highly oscillatory ordinary differential equations , see , for instance , @xcite or chapter xiii of the monograph @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , they were recognized to work well also for wave equations in the semilinear case , see @xcite .",
    "we show here , how these explicit methods can be put to use also in the quasilinear case . a careful choice of the filters in these integrators turns out to play a crucial role in avoiding the above - mentioned loss of derivatives .    for the considered and derived trigonometric integrators ,",
    "we rigorously prove second - order convergence in time .",
    "we also prove convergence of a fully discrete method which is based on a combination with a spectral discretization in space , without requiring any cfl - type coupling of the discretization parameters .",
    "see section [ sec - results ] for statements of the error bounds .",
    "the proofs of our convergence results are based on _ energy techniques _ as they are widely used in mathematical analysis to prove well - posedness of quasilinear equations and also well - established in the numerical analysis of quasilinear _ parabolic _ equations , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they have been applied in the recent analysis of _ implicit _ methods for quasilinear hyperbolic equations in @xcite for ( semi-)implicit euler methods and in @xcite for ( linearly ) implicit midpoint methods and implicit runge  kutta methods .    here , we are interested in the analysis of _ explicit _ trigonometric integrators for quasilinear wave equations in the form .",
    "note that in contrast to the semilinear case studied in @xcite , the proof uses a modified energy approach , and in the case of non - small @xmath14 , we also need tools from semiclassical pseudodifferential calculus .",
    "we distinguish in the following between two regimes of values of the coefficient @xmath14 in .",
    "the first regime is that of a weak nonlinearity in the sense that @xmath9 is small as in @xcite , whereas in the second regime @xmath9 is of order one .",
    "note that , as usual , the equation with @xmath15 and small initial values can be reduced to an equation of the form with small @xmath16 and initial values of order one .    in both cases , the convergence proof is based on energy techniques , where a nontrivial modified discrete energy is derived which can be used to prove stability of the methods under appropriate assumptions on the filters . while the convergence proof for small @xmath9 given in section [ sec - error - small ] for a semi - discrete and in section [ sec - error - small - full ] for a fully discrete method uses in addition only classical properties of sobolev spaces , the convergence proof for @xmath9 of order one given in section [ sec - error - large ] requires in addition semiclassical pseudodifferential calculus , which is reviewed in an appendix .",
    "more precisely , the semiclassical calculus is used in order to show that the properties of the filters ensure that the modified discrete energy is positive in the case of a non - small nonlinearity ( in the case of a small nonlinearity , we can get at this stage since the modified energy is a small perturbation of the modified energy corresponding to the linear wave equation . )    the methods and their analysis as presented in the present paper can be extended to higher spatial dimensions or to quasilinear wave equations without klein  gordon term @xmath17 on the right - hand side .",
    "moreover , we could also only assume that @xmath2 and @xmath1 are smooth on an open subset and deal with smooth solutions that stay in this subset on the considered time interval .",
    "in this way , our scheme can be used to approximate the classical @xmath18-system of elasticity and gas dynamics ( as long as the solutions are smooth and with no vacuum ) . see @xcite for instance for a discussion of this model .",
    "it would be interesting to see if our methods and their analysis can be extended to quasilinear wave equations with a semilinear term @xmath1 that depends also on @xmath19 ( for example in order to handle the equations considered in @xcite ) , to the more abstract classes of equations considered in @xcite , or to other equations with a possible loss of derivatives in explicit numerical methods , such as quasilinear schrdinger equations as considered in @xcite .",
    "* notation .",

    "the quasilinear wave equation can be written in compact form as @xmath36 with the nonlinearity @xmath37 and the linear operator @xmath38 that is , the operator @xmath39 acts on a function by multiplication of the @xmath40th fourier coefficient with @xmath41 .    for the discretization in time of , we use _ trigonometric integrators _ , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "* equation ( 2.12 ) ) .",
    "surprisingly , it shows up here again in the somehow unrelated context of finite - time error bounds for quasilinear wave equations . to deal with non - small @xmath16 in the quasilinear wave equation",
    ", we finally need in addition to and that , for a prescribed @xmath65 related to the size of the data , @xmath66 the crucial condition in is the second one which ensures a certain decay of @xmath49 .",

    "they are , for example , satisfied ( with @xmath67 ) for the trigonometric integrator of hairer & lubich @xcite , where @xmath68 and the one of grimm & hochbruck @xcite , where @xmath69    for non - small @xmath16 in , we need in addition condition to prove error bounds .",
    "a new method that we propose here for this case is therefore the trigonometric integrator with filter functions @xmath70 it satisfies all assumptions , and ( with @xmath71 ) .",
    "note that a filter function @xmath72 can be motivated as an averaging of fast forces over a time interval of length @xmath73 , see @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section xiii.1.4 ) . for @xmath74 ,",
    "the new method reduces to the method of grimm & hochbruck .      for a full discretization of ,",
    "we combine the trigonometric integrators of the previous section with a spectral galerkin method in space .",
    "we denote by @xmath75 the space of trigonometric polynomials of degree @xmath76 and by @xmath77 the @xmath78-orthogonal projection onto this ansatz space . in the semi - discretization in time or",
    ", we then replace the nonlinearity @xmath79 of by @xmath80 with @xmath81 where @xmath82 denotes the trigonometric interpolation in the space @xmath83 of trigonometric polynomials of degree @xmath76 .",
    "this gives the fully discrete method @xmath84 which computes approximations @xmath85 and @xmath86 to @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",

    "the full nonlinearity @xmath92 of can then also be computed with fast fourier techniques , even though it is defined via projection instead of trigonometric interpolation .",
    "this is based on the observation that the argument of the projection @xmath95 in as appearing in is a trigonometric polynomial of degree @xmath96 , and hence @xmath97 with the trigonometric interpolation @xmath98 in the larger space @xmath99 of trigonometric polynomials of degree @xmath100 .",
