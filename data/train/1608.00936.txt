    "the human brain is notoriously complex in its shape and connectivity , even at scales at which magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) can measure .",
    "visualization is a natural means of exploring possible relationships across scan types ( multimodal data ) or statistical variables ( multivariate data ) .",
    "however , visualizing brain image data in the original form of the brain can result in dense , cluttered , and uninterpretable images , whereas visualizing an abstract representation of information extracted from the same data can result in over - simplified images that are too removed from their source to be intuitive and meaningful @xcite . in this article",
    ", we introduce novel methods for representing brain image data that are conducive to interactive visualizations that retain some of the benefits of the data in their original space while taking advantage of the simplicity and elegance of more abstract formats . to attain this balance , we map cortical surfaces extracted from human brain image data onto 2d surfaces that preserve shape ( angle ) , extent ( area ) and spatial ( neighborhood ) information , split these surfaces into separate patches , and cluster connections between pairs of these patches .",
    "we maintain that the resulting visualizations are more intuitive and comprehensible than conventional native brain images or information graphics such as abstract network diagrams .",
    "the reason we are interested in visualizations of brain image data that are intermediate between realistic and abstract representations is not only that they could be easier to compute on than the original data and more visually intuitive to interact with than the abstract form , but they also have the potential to make it easier to simultaneously explore multiple data sets , modalities , and statistical maps .",
    "our focus in this work is to open up avenues to study the brain in simpler topological domains ( disk or sphere ) , keeping the integrity of the original data .",
    "this will allow the user to explore the brain in the native and transformed space seamlessly , and hence be able to confirm the findings from the transformed space in the native space and vice versa .",
    "apart from providing an easier way to visualize the brain data , the transformation to simpler topological domains also allows easier ways to compute on the brain data . in the following sections",
    ", we outline the details for our pipeline and the resultant visualizations .",
    "we use the human connectome project ( hcp ) @xcite data and a minimal preprocessing pipeline @xcite along with mindboggle @xcite , ants @xcite , and dsi studio @xcite to obtain the highest fidelity structural , functional , and diffusion data for our visualizations .",
    "the transformation of the brain data from the initial brain mri scans to the registered brain cortical surfaces ( triangular meshes ) , tractography data , and functional clusters is outlined in figure [ fig : pipeline ] .",
    "the hcp pipeline produces separate left and right brain cortical surfaces to allow their exploration in isolation .",
    "we remove the extraneous region added to these resultant cortical surfaces ( figure [ fig : angle_area_comparison_brain]b ) to allow for easier disk and spherical mapping , as demonstrated in the next section .        [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     using the spherical mapping described in figure [ fig : spherical_map ] , we can now map the stretched tracts in different exploded views to delineate the connections clearly , as demonstrated in figure [ fig : multi_mod_stretced_tracts_sphere ] .",
    "this allows the user to select and interact with individual coalesced fiber bundles in the transformed space .",
    "furthermore , we can overlay statistical activity maps from functional mri data onto the cortical surfaces and based on the seed points selected be able to see corresponding high activity area on the cortical surface , as shown in figure [ fig : functional_connectivity ] .",
    "this can be used to create connectivity diagram in figure [ fig : anatomical_connectivity ] , but with functional statistical activity maps overlaid on the two disks , as shown in figure [ fig : functional_anatomical_tubes ] .",
    "finally , we can consolidate all these modalities into a complete brain spherical map visualization , shown in figure [ fig : functional_anatomical_sphere ] .",
    "we introduced multimodal visualizations of the brain using the disk and spherical area - angle preserving mapping .",
    "the rest of the data is presented in different views on this domain . in this work ,",
    "we have focused on the cortical surface regions . in the future",
    ", we will include subcortical regions in our visualizations .",
    "we have used deterministic tractography because it provides a better granularity to study the brain than probabilistic tractography .",
    "we are currently working to include subcortical structures and probabilistic tractography with our current visualizations . in the future",
    ", we will incorporate information from other modalities , for example , positron emission tomography , magnetoencephalography , and electoencephalography .",
    "we will also extend our multimodal visualizations to other organs , such as prostate and pancreas .",
    "this project is partially funded by marcus foundation inc .",
