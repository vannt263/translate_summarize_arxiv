    ", @xmath9 takes values in @xmath10 and superscript @xmath11 denotes transposition . a complete and sufficient statistic for the parameter @xmath12",
    "is then @xmath13    to apply classical hypothesis testing ideas , we regard this model as a null hypothesis .",
    "we consider the omnibus alternative hypothesis that the sample is drawn from a distribution which is not in the parametric model .",
    "one common approach to this hypothesis testing problem is to define some statistic @xmath14 which measures in some way departure of the sample from what is expected if @xmath12 is the true value .",
    "since @xmath12 is unknown , it is replaced in this measure by @xmath15 , the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter vector , leading to the statistic @xmath16 .",
    "common examples include empirical distribution function statistics such as cramr ",
    "von mises , kolmogorov  smirnov , anderson  darling and many chi - squared statistics .",
    "the usual situation is that the test statistic has a distribution which depends , even in large samples , on the unknown parameter value ( exceptions arise in the normal and other families which have only location and/or scale parameters ) .",
    "thus , to implement the tests in practice it is necessary to specify how to compute critical points for the tests or how to compute appropriate @xmath17-values corresponding to the test statistics .",
    "a  method long in use is to derive large sample theory for the statistic @xmath18 , establishing the convergence in distribution of @xmath18 to some limiting distribution which depends on the true value of  @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath19 is the upper @xmath20 critical point of this limiting distribution and @xmath21 depends continuously on @xmath12 , then the test which rejects if @xmath22 has asymptotic level @xmath20 .",
    "see lockhart and stephens @xcite for a discussion of this method in testing fit for the von mises distribution for directional data ; this testing problem is discussed below in more detail .    a more modern method which achieves the same asymptotic behaviour is the parametric bootstrap .",
    "let @xmath23 denote the cumulative distribution function of @xmath18 when the true parameter value is @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath24 is the parametric bootstrap @xmath17-value .",
    "this @xmath17-value is usually computed approximately by generating some number , @xmath25 , of bootstrap samples drawn from the density @xmath26 , computing the statistic @xmath18 for each of these @xmath25 samples and then counting the fraction of these bootstrap statistic values which exceed the value of @xmath18 for the data set at hand .",
    "these two methods for goodness - of - fit testing both depend on asymptotic theory to justify their performance .",
    "they do not have , except in the location - scale situation mentioned , exact level @xmath20 and thus no exact finite sample optimality properties .",
    "conditional tests , which we discuss next , offer at least the potential for such optimality .",
    "( see remark  [ rem9 ] in the section for some comments . )",
    "one standard approach ( discussed in detail in @xcite ) to optimality theory is to search for powerful unbiased level @xmath20 tests : tests whose power never falls below @xmath20 on the alternative .",
    "such tests will generally have neyman structure ; that is , their level will be @xmath20 everywhere on the boundary of the null hypothesis . for the omnibus alternative ,",
    "this boundary is generally the entire model .",
    "now suppose @xmath27 is a complete sufficient statistic for this model .",
    "then the requirement that the level of the test be @xmath20 everywhere in the parametric model and completeness guarantee that the test must have conditional level @xmath20 .",
    "that is , an unbiased level @xmath20 test must have the property that the conditional probability of rejection given @xmath27 is identically @xmath20 .",
    "this is precisely the argument used in lehmann and romano @xcite to show that student s @xmath28 test is uniformly most powerful unbiased .    by a conditional test , then , we mean a test whose level , given the sufficient statistic @xmath27 , is identically @xmath20 .",
    "two recent papers on goodness - of - fit , lockhart , oreilly and stephens  @xcite , have compared such conditional tests with parametric bootstrap tests .",
    "they implemented their conditional tests as follows . for a test statistic @xmath18 ,",
    "let @xmath29 denote the conditional distribution function , when the true distribution of the data comes from the exponential family , of @xmath18 given @xmath27 .",
    "this function @xmath30 does not depend on @xmath12 .",
    "if this conditional distribution function is continuous then @xmath31 has a uniform distribution under @xmath32 ; it is therefore an exact @xmath17-value .",
    "these @xmath17-values are often computed by monte carlo or markov chain monte carlo ; see lockhart , oreilly and stephens @xcite for examples and references .    in lockhart ,",
    "oreilly and stephens @xcite , for instance , the authors considered an i.i.d .",
    "sample from the von mises distribution .",
    "observations @xmath1 are points on the unit circle ; see section [ vonmisessec ] below for details of the density .",
    "the complete sufficient statistic is @xmath33 and the authors use watson s @xmath34 statistic for @xmath18 .",
    "they use markov chain monte carlo methods to generated a sequence of samples from the conditional distribution of @xmath0 given @xmath27 ; all the generated samples have the same value of @xmath27 .",
    "the authors evaluate @xmath35 by computing @xmath34 for each data set and estimating @xmath35 by the fraction of samples giving larger values of @xmath34 than the original data sample .",
    "these authors also compute the parametric bootstrap value , @xmath36 , for the same statistic by generating i.i.d .",
    "samples from the von mises distribution using , for the parameter value , the estimate of the parameter derived from the original data .",
    "of course the values of the sufficient statistic @xmath27 vary from one bootstrap sample to another . again",
    "@xmath34 is computed for each bootstrap sample and a @xmath17 value is computed as the fraction of bootstrap @xmath34 values which are larger than the observed value of @xmath34 .",
    "very high correlations between the @xmath17-values computed using these two methods were observed in lockhart , oreilly and stephens @xcite .",
    "for example , they considered a test that a sample of size 34 comes from a von mises distribution . using watson s @xmath34 and generating samples from the null hypothesis they observed a correlation of 0.997 between the two @xmath17-values . for a sample of 55 observations ,",
    "the correlation observed was 0.9997 .",
    "here we show that for statistics @xmath18 of the cramr  von  mises type these two methods must give similar @xmath17-values because , when the null hypothesis is true , @xmath37 in probability , at least when the model being tested is an exponential family .",
    "in fact , the convergence is almost sure for samples from any distribution for which @xmath38 converges almost surely to an interior point of the parameter space . for statistics",

    "the large sample analysis of the unconditional distribution of such statistics comes from the well known weak convergence , in @xmath52 $ ] , of the process @xmath53 to a gaussian process , @xmath54 , which we now describe .",
    "let @xmath55 be the fisher information matrix and define the column vector @xmath56 where @xmath43 is defined as a function of @xmath42 by @xmath57 then the limit process @xmath54 has mean  0 and covariance function @xmath58 the statistics indicated above are all continuous functionals of @xmath53 ( under mild conditions on the weight functions involved ) and as such converge in distribution to the same functional applied to the limit process @xmath54 . see stephens @xcite for a detailed discussion of the resulting tests and shorack and wellner @xcite for mathematical details .",
    "the weak convergence result can be proved in two steps : prove convergence in distribution of the finite dimensional distributions of @xmath53 and then prove tightness of the sequence of processes in @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "we believe a similar result holds , in exponential families , conditional on the sufficient statistic .",
    "results in holst @xcite can be used to establish convergence of the conditional finite dimensional distributions but we are unable to extend the calculations to prove conditional tightness .",
    "instead we use holst s results and a  truncation argument to deal directly with statistics of the cramr ",
    "von mises or watson types . without tightness",
    "we can not handle statistics of the kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov type .",
    "our truncation argument uses an accurate approximation to the conditional expectation , given @xmath27 , of the statistic in question .",

    "the resulting tests are approximate ; that is , the distribution of the @xmath17-value is not exactly uniform though it becomes more so as the sample size increases .",
    "an alternative technique is to compute a conditional @xmath17 value using @xmath277 evaluated at @xmath42 equal to the observed value of @xmath18 .",
    "this @xmath17-value must generally be evaluated by monte carlo methods .",
    "for some distributions , such as the inverse gaussian , there is a direct way to simulate samples from the conditional distribution of the data given @xmath27 .",

    "indeed this equivalence of @xmath17-values requires only a large sample size and an estimate @xmath238 not too close to the boundary of @xmath7 .",
    "it is not at all necessary that the null hypothesis be true .",
    "of course if the null hypothesis is not true the estimate @xmath278 could converge to the boundary of the parameter space and then our results permit the @xmath17-values to be different even in large samples .    for fixed alternatives , our results imply that the difference in powers between the two tests tends to 0 except when @xmath279 does not have a limit in @xmath78 .",
    "the conclusions in theorem  2 can be extended to contiguous sequences of alternatives yielding conclusions that the two tests have identical limiting powers along such sequences .",
