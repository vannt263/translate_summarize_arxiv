    "though applications of great interest ( and increasing complexity ) continue to be developed , e.  g. ,  @xcite , the theory of the semi - classical quantization of invariant tori by the application of ebk quantization conditions  @xcite appears to be a closed ( or at least quiescent ) sector in the study of the relationship between the quantum mechanics and the classical mechanics of non - separable systems .",
    "( for exceptions , see the work of jaffe and collaborators  @xcite . and the even more recent work of morehead  @xcite . ) focusing on systems with two degrees of freedom",
    ", we can divide the many methods that have been developed and applied to this subject into two main sub - categories , those based on the solution of hamilton s equations as an initial - value problem , i.  e. , the calculation of trajectories , and those based on algebraic methods involving trajectories indirectly or not at all . within this subdivision ,",
    "referred to as m1 and m2 , respectively , we may distinguish principally :    m ?",
    "independent actions are computed from closed curves , signaling invariant tori , generated by the intersection of trajectories on two independent surfaces of section  @xcite .",
    "if invariant tori exist , the dynamical variables can be represented as multiply - periodic functions of the angle variables , with fourier coefficients that depend only on the frequencies , or equivalently , actions .",
    "equations of motion for the fourier coefficients are obtained in either hamiltonian or lagrangian form , and for each there is an associated variational principle .",
    "the equations of motion are solved either perturbatively or non - perturbatively and the quantized actions and energy calculated in terms of the known fourier coefficients  @xcite .",
    "this is the approach of paramount interest to us .",
    "consider the system hamiltonian to be a sum of an integrable part and a perturbation .",
    "the latter is turned on adiabatically over a time @xmath0 . from the assumption that the actions computed initially for the unperturbed system are approximate adiabatic invariants",
    ", it is possible to obtain quantum energies  @xcite ( sometimes even for values of the coupling strength at which associated invariant tori no longer exist ) .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi equation is solved iteratively , using a fourier series expansion , thus providing the generating function for the appropriate action - angle variables  @xcite .",
    "( in contrast the fourier series constructed in m2a are to be understood as the explicit equations of transformation from the original dynamical variables to the action - angle set . )",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that a finite set of adjacent non - quantized trajectories with the same total energy can be used to calculate accurate values of the actions for one of them .",
    "quantized energies and associated actions are computed by linear extrapolation . in this method",
    "it is necessary to propagate trajectories until they almost close on themselves .",
    "following the ideas of birkhoff and gustavson  @xcite , several groups  @xcite have carried out increasingly ambitious programs for transforming a given hamiltonian to normal form by a succession of canonical transformations .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is quantized and energy values obtained .",
    "trajectories propagated over a sufficiently large multiple of the elementary periods of a multiply - periodic orbit can be fourier transformed to yield the fourier representation of the fundamental dynamical variables .",
    "applying percival s formulas  @xcite , the actions are computed .",
    "initial conditions are varied until quantized orbits are found  @xcite .",
    "for further discussion and a more exhaustive list of references , we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "despite all this effort , there remains a gap in the study of the relationship between quantum mechanics and the theory of invariant tori , especially as it relates to the work that utilizes the description of invariant tori in terms of fourier series .",
    "this assertion is grounded on the observation that each form of quantum mechanics is associated in a natural way with a corresponding version of classical mechanics .",
    "thus in the same sense that schrdinger wave mechanics is naturally associated with the hamilton - jacobi equation , and the classical limit of the path - integral method is hamilton s variational principle , it is equally true that the classical limit of heisenberg matrix mechanics for bound systems are the equations of motion for multiply - periodic systems . though some of the work cited",
    "is based , in the sense of the correspondence principle , on this passage between quantum and classical descriptions , and the passage itself is in some respects well known ( see  @xcite , for instance ) , the main thesis of this paper is that this route for passing from the quantum to classical theory has not been fully explored .",
    "a possible explanation is that although the basic correspondence is well - known , it is hardly known outside the circle of the authors and former associates that matrix mechanics can be derived from a novel variational principle @xcite called the trace variational principle ( see also @xcite ) and that the classical limit of this principle is the variational principle for invariant tori @xcite .",
    "guided by this relationship , the main purpose of this work is to study the transition from the quantum to the classical domain more thoroughly than heretofore for both the dynamics and the kinematics ( quantization conditions ) .",
    "this has led to some results that we find it difficult to believe are not known , but for which we do not have an independent reference . in sec .",
    "ii , we supply a brief but self - contained account of our version of matrix mechanics , with emphasis on the variational basis .",
    "the passage to the semi - classical limit is then carried out in secs .",
    "iii and iv , where we show that the limit of the quantum variational principle is the variational principle for invariant tori .",
    "we find , however , that the relationship between the commutation relations and the ebk quantization conditions is more indirect , the former corresponding in the classical limit to the poisson bracket relations and the latter to the lagrange bracket relations @xcite . in sec .",
    "v , we study the commutation relations _ per se _ , the most tangible result being a new derivation of the wkb quantization condition , applicable to one - dimensional systems .",
    "section vi is devoted to some illustrative numerical studies .",
    "we describe in turn and then apply algorithms for carrying out the semiclassical calculations , the associated matrix quantum calculations , and a method for calculating directly quantum corrections to the semiclassical result .",
    "the need for the latter as a separate approach arises from the fact that the matrix quantum calculations are designed to give better results than the semiclassical one for low - lying states but do not go over in any limit to the ebk calculation .",

    "preliminary accounts of the main new theoretical results of this paper can be found in @xcite .",
    "we begin with a brief description of a variational principle , the so - called trace variational principle , from which one can derive heisenberg s form of quantum mechanics .",

    "a part of the logical story is clearly missing . on the one hand , we have derived the classical equations of motion from the quantum ones using correspondence principle arguments modified only minimally from historical forms . on the other hand , although ebk quantization can also be derived , up to the value of the maslov index , from the correspondence principle , what has not been made clear is the relationship between the canonical commutation relations and the ebk quantization conditions . though it is hard to believe that this question has not been addressed at some point in the history of quantum mechanics , we have never encountered such a discussion in the literature .",

    "it is in fact easy to see that this conclusion coincides with the corresponding statement contained in ( [ eq:4.13 ] ) .",

    "note that the range of parameters does not include those used in table iii .",
    "in this section , we raise a number of issues related to the semiclassical analysis that it may to profitable to explore . since some of the suggestions put forward in this section are speculative , they may also turn out to be worthless .",
    "we first consider other possible applications of linear variation about the semiclassical equations , as embodied in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e3 ] ) .",
    "these equations are a special case of the equations @xmath245 which has a number of possible applications , depending on the choice of the source vector @xmath246 .",

    "the solution to ( [ eq : ls4 ] ) determines the next approximation to @xmath249 , namely @xmath251    a2 ) if the above solution converges , we thereby define a `` stability matrix '' , @xmath250 . as we have already seen , it is this quantity that occurs when we differentiate eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ls1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ls2 ] ) with respect to @xmath252 , leading to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : e3 ] ) and ( [ eq : e4 ] ) .",
    "in addition to the application already described in the previous section , we can think of at several other applications of these equations .",
    "we consider only ( [ eq : e3 ] ) , but ( [ eq : e4 ] ) could be brought in .",
    "for example , they allow us to compute the energy of neighboring states , according to the formula ( two - dimensional example ) , @xmath253 where @xmath254 .",
    "work found in the literature , as far as we are aware , uses only the linear approximation to this result .",
    "as a second application , when we want to calculate solutions for a fixed hamiltonian and for values of the action neighboring to those for which solutions are already known , the solutions of the linearized equations can be used to obtain improved starting values for the newton - raphson iteration .",
    "+ a3 ) to obtain solutions for a neighboring hamiltonian , one can again use a form of ( [ eq : ls4 ] ) , with yet another driving term easily derived from the structure of the original nonlinear equations .    an important question that should be susceptible to study by the linearized formalism",
    "is the relation of an instability of a solution of the nonlinear equations to the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath250 .",
    "we now restrict our attention to the solutions of the equations of motion ( [ eq : ls1 ] ) for fixed frequency , i.  e. , we study the purely classical problem , setting aside for the moment the question of how to adjoin a quantization feature .",
    "let us imagine that we are interested in obtaining the fourier coefficients as functions of the frequency values .",
    "there arises the practical problem of how to choose a sensible grid of frequency values .",
    "this problem can be solved presumably by perturbation theory for small coupling , and we can use a form of the linearized analysis described above to show us how to change frequencies locally . as a first approximation to quantization - if only energies are of interest - we can compute values of the action from the fourier coefficients and the frequencies and write @xmath255 where we have used the tilde to indicate a non - quantized value , so that @xmath256 is not an integer . we can then extrapolate to the nearest quantized values of the energy by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : ls6 ] ) .",
    "if we want also the fourier amplitudes for the quantized invariant tori , we have to successively modify the frequencies until they assume values associated with quantized actions . for this purpose",
    "we might use the formula , @xmath257 the most practical way of calculating the required second derivatives would probably be from a grid of energy values .",
    "we finally note another possibly interesting way of utilizing a grid of fixed frequency solutions to quantize a system .",
    "consider , as a simple example , a two dimensional non - resonant system .",
    "write the classical hamiltonian in the normal form @xmath258 it would appear at first sight that the number of points on our grid of solution values will determine the number of terms that we can use in this equation , which yields a set of linear inhomogeneous values for the coefficients @xmath259 .",
    "we would then quantize the resulting hamiltonian by using the ebk quantization conditions or some variant , following the discussion of ref.@xcite .",
    "if we consider the usual procedure for constructing a form such as ( [ eq : ls9 ] ) , however , we would guess that our previous remarks are much too naive .",
    "one s ability to carry the expansion to a higher and higher order is contingent upon obtaining a perturbation expansion to the appropriate order . to make contact with methods based on fourier series",
    ", we must note that an analysis can be carried out which informs us which fourier components must be included to guarantee equivalence to a perturbation expansion up to a prescribed order .",
    "the solution of a nonlinear scheme including only these components , at the same time that it contains a selective ( and uncontrolled ) summation of higher order terms , is at least perturbatively correct to some controlled order .",
    "it is this latter order which would determine how many terms are allowed in the expansion ( [ eq : ls9 ] ) .",
    "to our knowledge this relationship between the methods based on fourier expansion and those based on normal forms has not been considered previously .",
    "can one use the variational principle directly to simply solution of the nonlinear equations ?",
    "let @xmath260 be the @xmath248 approximation to the average lagrangian .",
    "expanding to first order , @xmath261 consider first the fixed frequency case and choose @xmath262 this is useful provided the average lagrangian is truly an extremum .",
    "it would then appear that a suitable choice of the constant @xmath263 both as to magnitude and sign would move the average lagrangian to its extreme value .",
    "the reason that we must allow the constant to depend on the order of approximation is that we want to guarantee that the retained first order correction is larger than the omitted second - order terms .",
    "this means that we must start out with conservatively small values of the constant and let it increase toward unity as ( if ) we approach convergence .",
    "if we carry out a calculation at fixed action , we have to consider the equation , @xmath264 comparison with ( [ eq : ls10 ] ) suggests that we choose @xmath265 from this assumption , the assumption of fixed @xmath266 , and ( [ eq : ls11 ] ) we can derive a pair of linear equations for @xmath267 , namely @xmath268 here indices indicating the order of approximation are omitted . in the present case , there is no guarantee that the two first order correction terms in ( [ eq : ls10 ] ) are of the same sign , and thus the way that convergence may be achieved , if at all , is somewhat more problematical .",
    "in this paper we have presented a new view of the transition from heisenberg matrix mechanics to the theory of invariant tori .",
    "we have suggested a number of possible applications of the ideas that were presented mainly in secs .",
    "ii , iv , and vii .",
    "we have applied the ideas developed in secs .",
    "ii and iv to several standard models .",
    "the most important feature that has emerged from these applications is that the heisenberg mechanics can be developed into a quantum calculus that is only modestly more complicated than the semiclassical calculations associated with the theory of invariant tori .",
    "this can be done in two ways , either by starting with the semiclassical approximation and building a correction scheme about it , or else by constructing a fully quantum scheme starting from the ground state .    if one were now to ask for the most important next step that one could take with the heisenberg methods , an excellent candidate for an answer would be to produce solutions for a globally chaotic system such as the one studied by martens _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "it would also be worthwhile to revisit some old ground .",
    "as an example , we might restudy the edges of the regions , as a function of coupling strength and quantized actions , beyond which converged solutions of our equations can not be found .",
    "though some of this was done in the present work , the issue is somewhat muddied for the model chosen , since it does not , strictly speaking , possess a hilbert space .",
    "there is evidence , based on calculations for the standard mapping @xcite , that this failure represents an independent method for studying the disappearance of invariant tori .",
    "another idea that might be reexamined is that of approximate tori .",
    "reinhardt and associates have championed this idea , that permits ebk quantization to be applied past the point of breakdown of the associated invariant torus . this idea is suggested both by their work on the quantization of normal - form hamiltonians @xcite and on adiabatic switching @xcite .",
    "it reappears in the work of martens and ezra @xcite in that trajectories that appear to be associated with locally chaotic regions show enough well - defined fourier components so that quantized actions can be calculated .",
    "independently , we realized that this phenomena would manifest itself in our work as follows : the non - linear equations underlying our approach yield a solution when only a small number of fourier components are retained , but the solution blows up when an attempt to add components is made .",
    "by contrast , when invariant tori exist , this is signaled by insensitivity of the solution to the addition of fourier components beyond a fixed number .",
    "the finite fourier sums describe approximate invariant tori in the same general sense , though in a different approximation , as the approximate normal - form hamiltonians .",
    "the transition from the quantum to the classical domain by the methods of this paper presents a new aspect of the study of the consequences of the order in which the two limits @xmath269 , @xmath270 are taken @xcite . for the order studied in this paper , in which the time limit is taken first",
    ", it is quite impossible to strictly reach the regime of multiply periodic motion , as has already been pointed out in the body of our work .",
    "it may be of interest to to undertake a further study of the equations that can be obtained in this limit .",
    "there may also be some connection of these ideas with the idea of approximate tori .",
