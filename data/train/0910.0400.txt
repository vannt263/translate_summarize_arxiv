    "in addition , the possibility to control the magnetism of edge states in nanoribbons by applying external electric fields ,  @xcite make them very attractive for spintronic applications .",
    "@xcite however , for the design of realistic devices the effect of defects and impurities have to be taken into account . for this reason",
    ", quite a lot of work has been devoted to the study of defects and different types of impurities in these materials .",
    "it has now become clear that defects and dopants severely affect some the properties of graphenic systems and can be used to tune their response .",
    "for example , the strong interplay between the presence of defect or dopants and the magnetic properties of carbon nanostructures has been stressed by several authors .",
    "@xcite    here we focus on substitutional impurities in graphene , in which a single metal atom substitutes one or several carbon atoms in the layer .",
    "direct experimental evidence of the existence of these kind of defects has been recently provided by gan _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . using high - resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem )",
    ", these authors were able to visualize individual au and pt atoms incorporated into a very thin graphitic layer probably consisting of one or two graphene layers . from the real - time evolution and temperature dependence of the dynamics they obtained information about the diffusion of these atoms .",
    "large diffusion barriers ( @xmath42.5  ev ) were observed for in - plane migration , which indicates the large stability of these defects and the presence of strong carbon - metal bonds .",
    "these observations seem to indicated that the atoms occupy substitutional positions .",
    "there also exists evidence for the existence of substitutional ni impurities in single - walled carbon nanotubes ( swcnt )  @xcite and graphitic particles .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that ni substitutional defects were present in swcnt samples even after careful purification and that , according to their analysis of the x - ray absorption data , the most likely configuration was one in which the ni atom replaces a carbon atom , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the presence of substitutional defects can have important implications for the interpretation of some experimental evidence .",
    "for example , substitutionals of magnetic transition metals are expected to strongly influence the magnetic properties of graphenic nanostructures .",
    "interestingly transition metals , like fe , ni or co , are among the most common catalysts used for the production of swcnt  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , rodriguez - manzo and banhart  @xcite have recently demonstrated the possibility to create individual vacancies at desired locations in carbon nanotubes using electron beams .",
    "this ability , in combination with the observed stability of substitutional impurities , can open a route to fabricate new devices incorporating substitutional impurities in certain locations or arranged in particular ways .",
    "such devices would allow for experimental verification of some of the unsual magnetic interactions mediated by the graphenic carbon network that have been predicted recently .",
    "@xcite    in this work we study theoretically the structural , electronic and magnetic properties of 3@xmath0 transition metals , noble metals and zn as substitutional impurities in graphene using density functional ( dft ) calculations .",
    "we only consider the configuration proposed by ushiro _",
    "et al . _ ,  @xcite in which a single metal atom binds to a carbon monovacancy . throughout the paper",
    "we will refer to this structure as substitutional configuration .",

    "@xcite in particular , krasheninnikov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have presented the most complete first - principles study to date of metal atoms interacting with single and double vacancies in graphene . in most cases our results are in good agreement with their predictions and similar general trends are found .",
    "however , the electronic structure of these defects has not been analyzed in detail to date and no simple model to understand the observed behaviors has been presented so far . here",
    "we present the evolution of the electronic structure of the substitutional defects as we move along the transition series and correlate the observed changes with a simple picture of the metal - vacancy interaction .    in our study",
    "we pay special attention to the electronic and magnetic properties of the metal impurities .",
    "one of our key results is that the electronic and magnetic properties of these substitutional metals can be fully understood using a simple model based on the hybridization between the states of the metal atom , particularly the @xmath0 shell , and the defect levels associated with the unreconstructed carbon vacancy .",
    "the predictions of this model are in good agreement with the calculated dft band structures . with this model",
    "we can easily understand the non - trivial behavior found for the binding energy and for the size and localization of the spin moment as we increase the number of valence electrons in the impurity . in brief ,",
    "we have identified three different regimes that can be correlated with the electron filling of different carbon - metal hybridized levels : ( _ i _ ) bonding states are filled for sc and ti , and these impurities are non - magnetic ; ( _ ii _ ) the non - bonding @xmath0 shell is partially occupied for v , cr and mn and , correspondingly , these impurities present large and localized spin moments ; ( _ iii _ ) antibonding states with increasing carbon character are progressively filled for co , ni , the noble metals and zn , giving rise to spin moments that oscillate between 0 and 1  @xmath2 and are increasingly delocalized .",
    "we have also found that zn becomes non - magnetic due to a jahn - teller distortion .",
    "however , it is possible to stabilize a symmetric configuration with a spin moment of 2@xmath2 with a very small energy penalty of @xmath4150  mev .",
    "finally , our calculations confirm that , the unexpected result that au substitutionals  @xcite present a spin moment of 1@xmath2 , also holds for ag and cu , and thus stems only from the number of valence electrons ( see the slater - pauling - like plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "we have studied with special detail the complex case of fe .",
    "this impurity occupies a distinct position at the boundary between two different regimes and its magnetic behavior stems from the competition between the carbon - metal hybridization and the electron - electron interaction within the 3@xmath0 shell . as a result , the spin moment of fe is specially difficult to describe : although non - magnetic using standard functionals within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite , the magnetism of fe appears using the so - called lda+u methodology with reasonably low values of the u parameter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after a brief description of the computational approach in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] , we present a summary of the structure , energetics and magnetic properties of all the studied elements in sec .  [ sec : summary ] . in this section we also indicate the general ideas behind our model of the metal - carbon hybrization in these systems . in sec .",

    "the zn substitutional impurity with its janh - teller distorsions is described in sec .  [",
    "sec : zn ] . a special section ( sec .",
    "[ sec : femnborder ] ) is devoted to describe the special role of fe at the border between two different regimes",
    ". finally , we close with some general conclusions .",
    "we have used two different approaches to perform our dft calculations : the siesta method  @xcite using a basis set of localized numerical - atomic - orbitals  @xcite ( naos ) and the vasp code@xcite using a basis set of plane waves .",
    "we have used the perdew - burke - ernzerhof  @xcite gga ( pbe - gga ) functional in all our calculations .",
    "most of our results are obtained using a 4@xmath54 supercell .",
    "this supercell is sufficiently large to obtain reliable results .",
    "this has been proven by performing calculations using larger supercells up to 8@xmath58 for several elements .",
    "the utilized codes perform three - dimensional periodic calculations . in order to avoid spurious interactions between periodic images of the defective graphene layer ,",
    "the size of the supercell perpendicular to the plane was always larger than 15   .",
    "the convergence with respect to the number of @xmath6-points was specially critical to obtain accurate results for the spin moment in the studied systems .",
    "for all the impurities and different supercell sizes we have used a large number of @xmath6-points , consistent with a 136@xmath5136 monkhorst - pack  @xcite sampling of the unit cell of graphene , in combination with a fermi - smearing of 21  mev .",
    "all the atomic coordinates were always optimized until forces along all directions were smaller than 0.05 ev /  .    for the siesta calculations we have used troullier - martins norm - conserving pseudopotentials",
    "@xcite generated using the pseudization radii shown in the appendix .",
    "the pseudopotentials for the metal atoms include nonlinear core corrections  @xcite for exchange and correlation .",
    "the pseudocore radii ( @xmath7 ) have been optimized for each element and are also presented in the appedix .",
    "using nonlinear core corrections is known to be critical to describe properly the spin moment and magnetic properties of transition metals .",
    "we have tested that these pseudopotentials yield the correct spin moments and band structures in bulk phases .",
    "the spacing of the real - space grid used to calculate the hartree and exchange - correlation contribution to the total energy and hamiltonian with siesta was equivalent to a 180 ry plane - wave cutoff .",
    "a double-@xmath8 polarized ( dzp )  @xcite basis set has been used for the calculation of the magnetic and electronic properties .",
    "however , we have checked that using a double-@xmath8 ( dz ) basis set for carbon yields almost identical relaxed structures as the dzp basis and , therefore , we have used the smaller dz basis for most of the structural relaxations .",
    "the shape of the basis orbitals was automatically determined by siesta using the algorithms described in ref .  .",
    "the cutoff radii of the different orbitals was obtained using an _ energy shift _ of 50  mev .",
    "although this basis set proved to be sufficiently accurate to describe the geometries , spin moments and band structures , for some metal atoms the binding energies where slightly overestimated .",
    "for those atoms the radii of the basis orbitals were enlarged ( using smaller values of the _ energy shift _ parameter ) until binding energies were converged within a few tens of mev .",
    "the resulting radii are shown in the appendix .    with the vasp code",
    "we have used a well converged plane - wave cutoff energy of 400 ev combined with the projected - augmented - wave ( paw ) method .",
    "using the provided paw potentials allows to check the possible limitations of pseudopotential calculations .",
    "however , as shown below , the agreement between both sets of calculations is excellent .",
    "we have also performed gga+u calculations using the formulation of dudarev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite . in this formulation",
    "a single u parameter is used , which we have taken as an empirical parameter and varied in the range 1 - 4.5  ev in our calculations for all the studied impurities . only for fe , gga+u results showed significant ( qualitative ) differences respect to those of pbe - gga calculations .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "in most cases the metal atom occupies an almost perfect symmetric configuration with c@xmath9 symmetry .",
    "exceptions are the noble metals , that are slightly displaced from the central position , and zn that suffers a jahn - teller distortion in its most stable configuration .",
    "however , we have found that it is also possible to stabilize a symmetric configuration for zn with a binding energy only @xmath4150  mev smaller .",
    "this configuration was overlooked in a recently published study on these systems  @xcite and we will refer to it as zn@xmath15 throughout the paper .    figures  [ fig : fig2 ] presents a summary of the structural parameters of substitutional 3@xmath0 transition metals , noble metals and zn in graphene .",

    "we have also performed calculations using a larger 8@xmath58 supercell and find almost identical results .",
    "this is particularly true for the total spin moments , which are less dependent on the size of the supercell , but require a sufficiently dense k - point sampling to converge . in the following we will mainly discuss the results obtained with the smaller cell since the plots of the band structures are easier to interpret in that case . finally ,",
    "as already mentioned , noble metals and zn present a distorted configuration . a detailed description of the structural parameters in these cases will be given below , here we only present the averaged structural data for noble metals and those corresponding to the zn@xmath15 case .    the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] are basically consistent with those reported by krasheninnikov _",

    "transition metals these distances decrease as we increase the atomic number , with a small discontinuity when going from mn to fe .",
    "the carbon - metal bond length reaches its minimum for fe ( d@xmath16=1.76   ) , keeping a very similar value for co and ni . for cu and zn the distances increase",
    "reflecting the fully occupied 3@xmath0 shell and the large size of the 4@xmath17 orbitals . among the noble metals we find that , as expected , the bond length largely increases for ag with respect to cu , but slightly descreases when going from ag to au .",
    "the latter behavior can be understood from the compression of the 6@xmath17 shell due to scalar relativistic effects .",
    "the binding energies of the studied substitutional metal atoms in graphene can be found in panel ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] . in general , the behavior of the binding energies can be correlated with that of the carbon - metal bond length , although the former is somewhat more complicated .",
    "binding energies for transition metals are in the range of 8 - 6  ev .",
    "ti presents the maximum binding energy , which can be easily understood since for this element all the metal - carbon bonding states ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : scti ] ) become fully occupied .",
    "one could expect a continuous decrease of the binding energy as we move away from ti along the transition metal series and first the non - bonding 3@xmath0 and later the metal - carbon antibonding levels become populated .",
    "however , the behavior is non - monotonic and the smaller binding energies among the 3@xmath0 transition metals are found for cr and mn , while a local maximum is observed for co. this complex behavior is related to the simultaneous energy down - shift and compression of the 3@xmath0 shell of the metal as we increase the atomic number .",
    "this will become more transparent when discussing in detail the metal - carbon hybridization levels . in brief , the behavior of the binding energies of the substitutional 3@xmath0 transition metal comes from two competing effects :    ( _ i _ ) as the 3@xmath0 shell becomes occupied and moves to lower energies the hybridization with the carbon vacancy states near the fermi energy ( e@xmath13 ) is reduced , which decreases the binding energy ;    ( _ ii _ ) the transition from mn to late transition metals is accompanied by a shift of the metal - carbon bond length of @xmath40.1   , which increases the carbon - metal interaction and , correspondingly , the binding energy .",
    "binding energies for noble metals are considerably smaller than for transition metals and mirror the reverse behavior of the bond lengths : 3.69 , 1.76 and 2.07  ev , respectively , for cu , ag and au . the smallest binding energy ( @xmath41  ev ) among the metals studied here is found for zn , withh filled @xmath17-@xmath0 electronic shells .",
    "the spin moments of substitutional transition and noble metals in graphene are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "again they are in agreement with the results of ref .  .",
    "however , we advance a simple model to understand the observed behavior which was not presented in that reference .",
    "one of the fundamental results of our study is a detailed model of the bonding and electronic structure of substitutional transition metals in graphene . as we will see below",
    ", the evolution of the spin moment can be completely understood using such model . in brief",
    ", we can distinguish different regimes according to the filling of electronic levels of different ( bonding , non - bonding and antibonding ) character :    ( _ i _ )",
    "all the carbon - metal bonding levels are filled for sc and ti and , correspondingly , the spin - moment is zero ;    ( _ ii _ ) non - bonding 3@xmath0 levels become populated for v and cr giving rise to a spin moment of , respectively , 1 and 2  @xmath2 with a strong localized @xmath0 character ;    ( _ iii _ ) for mn one additional electron is added to the antibonding @xmath18 level and the spin moment increases to 3  @xmath2 ;    ( _ iv _ ) finally , for fe and heavier atoms all the non - bonding 3@xmath0 levels are occupied and the spin moment oscillates between 0 and 1  @xmath2 as the antibonding metal - carbon levels become occupied .",
    "the sudden decrease of the spin moment from 3  @xmath2 for mn to 0  @xmath2 for fe is characterized by a transition from a complete spin - polarization of the non - bonding 3@xmath0 levels to a full ocuppation of those bands . however , this effect depends on the ratio between the effective electron - electron interaction within the 3@xmath0 shell and the metal - carbon interaction ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : femnborder ] ) . as we will see below ,",
    "if the hybridization with the neighboring atoms is artificially reduced , for example by increasing the fe - c distance , fe impurities develop a spin moment of 2  @xmath2 . our results also show that it is also possible to switch on the spin moment of fe by changing the effective electron - electron interaction within the 3@xmath0 shell .",
    "this can be done using the so - called gga+u method . for a large enough value of u ( in the range 2 - 3  ev ) ,",
    "fe impurities develop a spin moment of 1  @xmath2 .",
    "this will be also explained in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : femnborder ] .",
    "for the time being we just point out that this behavior is unique to fe : using similar values of u for other impurities does not modify their spin moments .    at the level of the gga calculations",
    "fe constitutes the border between two different characters of the spin moment associated with the substitutional metal impurities in graphene : 3@xmath0 magnetism for v - mn and a `` defective - carbon '' -like magnetism for heavier atoms . for co , ni , the noble metals and zn the electronic levels close to the e@xmath13 have a stronger contribution from the carbon nearest - neighbors and resemble the levels of the isolated d@xmath1 carbon vacancy .",
    "in particular , mulliken population analysis show that the spin moment of the noble metals impurities has a dominant contribution for the three nearest carbon neighbors ( see table  [ tab : spinmoment ] ) . for zn",
    "two electrons occupy a two - fold degenerate level reminiscent of the e @xmath11 level of the unreconstructed carbon vacancy ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : d3hvac ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the system suffers a jahn - teller distortion and has a zero spin moment .",
    "however , it is possible to stabilize a symmetric configuration ( zn@xmath10 ) with a moment of 2  @xmath2 and only slightly higher in energy .",
    "we have seen in the previous summary of results that , as substitutional impurities in graphene , most of the metal atoms studied here present a threefold symmetrical configuration .",
    "for this reason we have found particularly instructive to analyze their electronic structure as the result of the hybridization between the atomic levels of the metal atoms with the electronic levels associated with an unrelaxed d@xmath1 symmetrical carbon vacancy .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ]  ( a ) shows the electronic structure of such d@xmath1 carbon vacancy as calculated using 4@xmath54 graphene supercell , while panel ( b ) presents a simplified scheme that highlights the defect levels associated with the vacancy and indicates their different character and symmetry .",
    "the defect levels of the d@xmath1 vacancy can be easily classified according to their @xmath11 or @xmath12 character and whether they transform according to a or e - type representations .",
    "close to the e@xmath13 we can find a fully symmetric a @xmath12 level ( thus belonging to the a@xmath19 irreducible representation ) and two degenerate ( at @xmath20 ) defect levels with e symmetry and @xmath11 character ( e@xmath21 representation ) .",
    "approximately 4  ev below e@xmath13 we find another defect level with a @xmath11 character ( a@xmath22 representation ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that it is not possible to identify any localized defect level with e @xmath12 ( e@xmath23 ) character .",
    "this is due to the strong coupling with the delocalized states in the graphene layer and contrasts to the case of the a @xmath12 level .",
    "the a @xmath12 level lies very close to e@xmath13 , where the density of states is low , and due to its a symmetry can not appreciably couple to the delocalized @xmath12 states of graphene in that energy range . on the contrary",

    "the sc - vacancy @xmath12-@xmath18 impurity level captures an electron from the extended states of the graphene layer which becomes p - doped . in total",
    ", the substituional sc - graphene system does not show any spin polarization .",
    "we can now contrast the expectations from our model with actual calculations .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig6 ] shows the band structure of sc ( a ) and ti ( b ) close to the e@xmath13 . as expected , the main contribution from the 3@xmath0 shell is found above e@xmath13 .",
    "below e@xmath13 we find one defect band with @xmath12-@xmath18 character and two bands ( degenerate at @xmath20 ) with @xmath11-@xmath0 character .",
    "these bands are in close correspondence with the bonding a and e levels appearing in our model . in the case of ti",
    "the e@xmath13 is located inside a gap of @xmath40.5  ev that opens at k point in the brillouin zone .",
    "this gap appears due to the relatively small 4@xmath54 supercell used in these calculations and is reduced when larger supercells are used .",
    "thus , the filling of the graphene extended bands is not appreciably changed by substitutional doping with ti . for sc",
    "the situation is different . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ]  ( a ) e@xmath13 moves away from the k point , the sc - vacancy complex captures one electron and the graphene layer becomes doped with holes .    regarding the unocuppied bands , the 3@xmath0 contribution for sc above e@xmath13 appears quite broadened due to the strong hybridization with the graphene states .",
    "indeed , the defect levels are somewhat difficult to identify and to correlate with our model .",
    "one exception is a flat band with strong @xmath18 character appearing at @xmath41.5  ev that , due to its symmetry , does not couple so efficiently with the host states .",
    "the case of ti is much easier to interpret in terms of the simplified model presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ]  ( a ) .",
    "in particular , we can find two bands at @xmath40.6  ev with strong @xmath27 and @xmath28 contribution that correspond with the non - bonding @xmath0 impurity levels , and one band with @xmath18 character at @xmath40.8  ev corresponding with the a @xmath12-@xmath18 antibonding level .",
    "around 2.6  ev we can also find the two e @xmath11-@xmath0 antibonding defect levels , although in this case much more hybridized with the host .",
