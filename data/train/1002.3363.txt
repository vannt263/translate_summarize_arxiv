    "this infinite process is called a cascade .",
    "we will later define it more precisely .",
    "it has been repeatedly observed in a large variety of scientific contexts that the presence of infinitely many period - doubling cascades is a precursor to the onset of chaos .",
    "for example , cascades occur in what numerically appears as the onset to chaos for both the double - well duffing equation , as shown figure  [ fig : vdp ] , and the forced - damped pendulum , shown figure  [ fig : pend ] .",
    "cascades were first reported by myrberg in 1962  @xcite , and studied in more detail by feigenbaum  @xcite .",
    "this cascade is not the only cascade .",
    "in fact , there are infinitely many distinct period - doubling cascades .",
    "namely , there are infinitely many windows , that is , disjoint intervals in the parameter that begin with a saddle - node ( or source - sink ) bifurcation , and continue with the attractor undergoing an infinite sequence of period doublings within that interval of parameters .",
    "quadratic maps as in the example in figure  [ fig : mu - xx ] has the quite atypical property that as the parameter increases , there are no bifurcations that destroy periodic orbits .",
    "such maps are called * monotonic*. ( this monotonicity was originally proved implicitly by douady and hubbard in the complex analytic setting .",
    "see the milnor - thurston paper @xcite for a proof . )",
    "once one knows that a map is monotonic , it is easy to show that as chaos develops there must be infinitely many cascades .",
    "see figures  [ fig : mu - xx ] , and  [ fig : quadratic][fig : perdoubcascade ] .",
    "the monotonicity property is a quite severe restriction , even in one - dimension .",
    "no higher dimensional maps that develop chaos are monotonic ; yet numerical studies indicate that there are infinitely many cascades whenever there is one . see for example figures  [ fig : vdp ] ,  [ fig : pend ] , and  [ fig : henon1 ] . in this paper we summarize our progress and give new extensions to our theory that explains why there are infinitely many cascades in the onset to chaos .",
    "our explanation is also valid for maps of arbitrary dimension .    in the first result of this paper",
    ", we consider the context in which virtually all periodic saddles have the same unstable dimension .",
    "( by * virtually * we mean all except for a finite number . ) in this case , the onset of chaotic behavior always includes infinitely many cascades .",
    "there is an extensive literature on routes to chaos ; that is , situations in which for some @xmath15 and @xmath0 , the trajectory of @xmath16 under @xmath1 is in the basin of a chaotic attractor , whereas under @xmath17 it is not .",
    "whatever might have happened that caused this change between @xmath15 and @xmath0 is called a route to chaos .",
    "we prefer to call these `` routes to a chaotic attractor '' to be more specific .",
    "there are many different routes to a chaotic attractor .",
    "see our discussion section for a partial enumeration .",
    "for many maps there is competition between instability and stability .",
    "for example , the appearance of an attracting periodic orbit as a parameter is varied may mask the chaotic dynamics , and when the orbit becomes unstable , a chaotic attractor is likely to appear .",
    "hence a periodic orbit s loss of stability is one example of a route to a chaotic attractor .",
    "this approach ignores the question we address here : how did the chaotic dynamics arise in the first place ?",
    "* cascades for @xmath18 . *",
    "the logistic map has infinitely many cascades of attracting periodic orbits , and all cascades start at the stable orbit of a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "the unstable orbits form what we call the * stems * of the cascades ( shown in color ) .",
    "each stem continues to exist for all large @xmath12 values . by our terminology",
    ", this means that all the cascades shown are solitary ( on any parameter interval @xmath19 $ ] , for @xmath20 and any @xmath21 ) since the stem does not connect its cascade to a second cascade .",

    "see section  [ sec : definitions ] for full definitions of these terms .",
    "furthermore , the chaos persists for all parameters larger than a certain value .",
    "however , in many scientific contexts , it is common to see chaotic behavior appear and then disappear as the parameter @xmath12 increases .",
    "thus as it increases there is both a route to chaos followed by a route away from chaos . in this situation",
    "virtually all cascades are * paired * ; that is , two cascades are connected by a path of regular periodic orbits .",
    "see figure  [ fig : henon1 ] .",
    "* solitary cascades are robust . * in our second set of results , we show that while paired cascades can be easily created and destroyed , solitary cascades are far more robust even in the presence of rather large perturbations of a map .",
    "solitary cascades usually have stems with a constant period .",
    "this * stem - period * can be thought of as the period that starts the cascade .",
    "these ideas give quite striking results .",
    "for example for each period @xmath23 the following two maps @xmath24 and @xmath25 have exactly the same number of solitary cascades of stem - period @xmath23  assuming the bifurcations of the second map are * generic*. namely , we call a map generic if its periodic orbit bifurcations are all generic .",
    "see section  [ sec : definitions ] for the full definitions of these terms .",
    "we know that all the bifurcation orbits are generic for almost every smooth map , and that if a smooth map is not generic , then it has infinitely many generic maps arbitrarily close to it , but unfortunately  with few exceptions  we can not tell if a given map is generic .",
    "the map @xmath26 has no paired cascades , but the @xmath27 may .",
    "for example there is exactly one solitary cascade with stem - period @xmath28 and one with stem - period @xmath29 .",
    "these results extend to @xmath30 where g is smooth ( ie .",
    "infinitely continuously differentiable ) and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are uniformly bounded  as would be the case if @xmath33 was smooth and periodic in each variable , again assuming the map @xmath3 has generic bifurcations",

    "* the paper proceeds as follows : in section  [ sec : definitions ] , we give some basic definitions , including what we mean by a cascade , the definition of chaos that we use here , and the class of generic maps with which we work .",
    "section  [ sec : firstresult ] contains a series of results relating chaos and cascades , with an explanation of the concrete relationship between periodic orbits within the chaos and the resulting cascades along the route towards this chaos . in section  [ sec : secondresult ] , we discuss the fact that all cascades are either paired or solitary , and show that solitary cascades are robust under changes in the map .    in section  [ sec : paired ] , we show that if there is chaotic behavior interspersed with non - chaotic behavior , then virtually all cascades are paired .",
    "it is common in scientific applications that chaos is interspersed with orderly behavior , in what we call * off - on - off chaos * ( defined formally in section  [ sec : paired ] ) .",
    "our numerical studies indicate that this occurs multiple times for both the forced - damped pendulum and double - well duffing examples .",

    "thus rpo is locally a curve consisting of c and either a or b , depending on which is regular . for the quadratic map @xmath37 , only ( a ) and ( d ) occur .",
    "that is , periodic orbits are created but never destroyed as @xmath12 increases .",

    "a cascade is a path of regular periodic orbits that has infinitely many period - doubling bifurcations with the periods going to infinity at the end of the path .",
    "solid lines denote regular orbits , and dashed lines denote flip orbits .",
    "this figure uses only the orbit - creation bifurcations , ( a ) and ( d ) in figure  [ fig : snpd ] .",
    "if only bifurcation types ( a ) and ( d ) are present and @xmath16 is scalar , then each saddle - node spawns an unstable branch and an attractor as @xmath12 increases . for @xmath38 , there are no attractors for @xmath39 for @xmath0 sufficiently large .",
    "hence this branch of attractors can not continue forever and must bifurcate . only ( d ) is available , spawning a flip orbit branch and a doubled - period branch of attractors . again",
    "this new branch of attractors can not continue forever as @xmath12 increases . in this way , an infinite set of period - doublings results before @xmath12 reaches @xmath0 .",
    "much more complicated patterns are possible when all four types of bifurcations are allowed , including period - halving as well as period - doubling , and the path may contain many saddle - node bifurcations . ]",

    "( in one dimension , this condition is : derivative with respect to @xmath16 is @xmath52 . in dimension two ,",
    "flip orbits are those with exactly one eigenvalue @xmath53 . )",

    "this is equivalent to the statement that for some @xmath67 , we have @xmath68    * periodic orbit chaos . * chaotic behavior is a real world phenomenon , and trying to give it a single definition is like trying to define what a horse is .",

    ". a child s definition of a horse might be clear but would be unsatisfactory for a geneticist ( whose definition might be in terms of dna ) and neither would satisfy a breeder of horses who might give a recursive definition , `` an offspring of two horses . ''",
    "definitions of real - life phenomena describe aspects of that phenomena .",
    "they might agree in the great majority of cases on which animals are horses , though there may be rare atypical exceptions like clones where they might disagree . just as it is impossible currently to connect the shape and sound of a horse with its dna sequence , it is similarly impossible currently to identify in full generality positive lyapunov exponents with exponential growth of periodic orbits .",
    "similarly `` chaos '' and `` chaotic '' should have definitions appropriate to the needs of the user . on the other hand , an experimenter might insist that to be chaotic , there must be a chaotic attractor , until he / she starts looking for chaos on basin boundaries and finds transient chaos .",

    "we make no such restriction .",

    "this occurs whenever there is a horseshoe for some iterate of the map .",
    "it is sufficiently general to include having one or multiple co - existing chaotic attractors , as well as the case of transient chaos .",

    "<S> the appearance of infinitely - many period - doubling cascades is one of the most prominent features observed in the study of maps depending on a parameter . </S>",
    "<S> they are associated with chaotic behavior , since bifurcation diagrams of a map with a parameter often reveal a complicated intermingling of period - doubling cascades and chaos .    </S>",
    "<S> period doubling can be studied at three levels of complexity . </S>",
    "<S> the first is an individual period - doubling bifurcation . </S>",
    "<S> the second is an infinite collection of period doublings that are connected together by periodic orbits in a pattern called a cascade . </S>",
    "<S> it was first described by myrberg and later in more detail by feigenbaum . </S>",
    "<S> the third involves infinitely many cascades and a parameter value @xmath0 of the map at which there is chaos . </S>",
    "<S> we show that often virtually all ( i.e. , all but finitely many ) `` regular '' periodic orbits at @xmath0 are each connected to exactly one cascade by a path of regular periodic orbits ; and virtually all cascades are either paired  connected to exactly one other cascade , or solitary  connected to exactly one regular periodic orbit at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the solitary cascades are robust to large perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> hence the investigation of infinitely many cascades is essentially reduced to studying the regular periodic orbits of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> examples discussed include the forced - damped pendulum and the double - well duffing equation . </S>"
