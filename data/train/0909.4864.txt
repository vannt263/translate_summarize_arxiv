    "jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model ( jcm ) , describing the basic interaction of a two - level atom with a quantized electromagnetic field , is a cornerstone to describe the interaction between light and matter in _ quantum optics",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "this famous model can explain many quantum phenomena and can be implicated in recent quantum - state engineering and quantum information processing ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "usually , jcms are implemented with the natural atoms in the cavity qed systems ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . there",
    ", the cavities refer to the quantized optical or microwave resonators , and the natural atoms are usually prepared at certain rydberg states  @xcite . during the flying atoms crossing the cavity ,",
    "the jc interaction between two selected internal electronic levels of the atoms and the cavity mode can be realized .",
    "certainly , there has been also interested to realize the jc hamiltonian with other physical systems such as the trapped ions  @xcite .",
    "electrons on the liquid helium ( called usually the surface - state electrons ) is one of the promise candidates , introduced first by platzman and dykman  @xcite , to implement quantum information processing .",
    "electrons on the surface of liquid helium are trapped in a set of one - dimensional ( @xmath1d ) hydrogenic levels by their dielectric image potentials , and laterally confined by the voltage on the micro - electrodes set below the liquid helium .",
    "a set of electrons trapped on the liquid helium are effectively coupled together via their coulomb interactions . by applying microwave radiation to these surface - state electrons from the micro - electrodes , their  atomic \" states ( acting as qubits )",
    "could be coherently controlled . due to its scalability , easy manipulation , and relative long coherence time ,",
    "this system has been paid much attention in recent years to implement quantum information processing ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    in a recent work  @xcite , we have first shown that , under the drivings of the applied laser beams , two directional motions ( i.e. , the vertical direction s  artificial \" hydrogen and the in - plane bosonic modes ) of the trapped electrons could be coupled together to generate the desirable jcms . this is similar to the laser - assisted coupling between the internal electronic and external motional states of trapped ions  @xcite . in order to implement jcms with significantly strong coupling in the system of electrons floating on liquid helium , here a thz cavity , instead the quantized in - plane vibration of the electron ,",
    "is introduced to _",
    "resonantly _ couple the  artificial \" hydrogen .",
    "the configuration considered here is a single surface - state electron trapped in a thz cavity .",
    "the cavity - induced interaction between the electron s in - plane oscillation ( the relevant vibrational region is much smaller than the wavelength of the cavity mode ) and the atomic levels is negligible .",
    "thus , the  artificial \" hydrogen could only be resonantly coupled to the quantized thz mode and the desirable jcm with strong coupling could be realized .",
    "furthermore , a driven jcm  @xcite could also be generated by additionally applying an external classical laser beam to drive the electron . with such a driven jcm",
    ", we show that some nonclassical quantum states , such as the coherent states and schr@xmath0dinger cat states , of the thz cavity could be easily prepared .",
    "a single electron floating on the surface of liquid helium ( e.g. , @xmath2 ) is weakly attracted by the dielectric image potential @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is electron ( with mass @xmath5 ) charge , @xmath6 is the distance above liquid helium surface , and @xmath7 with @xmath8 being dielectric constant of liquid @xmath2  @xcite . a barrier ( due to the pauli force ) about @xmath1  ev is formed to prevent the electron penetrates into the liquid helium .",
    "thus , the electron s motion normal to the liquid helium surface can be approximately described by a @xmath1d hydrogen .",
    "the energy levels associated with this motion form a hydrogen - like spectrums @xmath9 , which has been experimentally observed  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding wave functions read  @xcite @xmath10l_{n-1}^{(1)}(\\frac{2z}{nr_b}),\\ ] ] with the bohr radius @xmath11   , and laguerre polynomials @xmath12.\\ ] ]    in the plane of the liquid helium surface , the electron could be confined by an potential generated by the charge @xmath13 on the micro - electrode , which is located at @xmath14 beneath the liquid helium surface ( see fig.1 ) . for simplicity , on the liquid helium surface the electron",
    "is assumed to be effectively constrained to move only along the @xmath15-axes .",
    "therefore , under the usual condition @xmath16 , the total potential of the electron can be effectively approximated as  @xcite @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this indicates that the motions of the trapped electron can be regarded as a 1d _ stark - shifted _ hydrogen along the @xmath6-direction , and a harmonic oscillation along the @xmath15-direction .",
    "following dykman et.al .",
    "@xcite , only two lowest levels ( i.e. , the ground state @xmath20 and first excited state @xmath21 ) of the 1d hydrogen are considered to generate a qubit . as a consequence ,",
    "the hamiltonian describing the electron reads @xmath22 here , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the bosonic creation and annihilation operators of the vibrational quanta ( with frequency @xmath25 ) of the electron s oscillation along the @xmath15-direction .",
    "@xmath26 is the pauli operator .",
    "the transition frequency @xmath27 is defined by @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 being the corresponding energies of the lowest two levels , respectively .     submerged by the depth @xmath14 beneath the helium surface.,width=340 ]",
    "we now suppose that the above surface - state electron is trapped just right in a qed cavity , see fig.1 . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that a standing wave propagate on the @xmath15 axis and the electric vector of the cavity takes the form  @xcite @xmath31 here , @xmath32 is the vacuum dielectric constant , @xmath33 is the frequency of the electric field , @xmath34 is the normalized volume of the field , @xmath35 represents the unit polarized vector of @xmath6-direction , @xmath36 is the wave number , @xmath15 denotes the position of the oscillating electron from its trapped center , @xmath37 accounts for the relative position of the center of the electron to the standing wave and @xmath38 means that the ion is centered at an antinode of the standing wave , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the creation and annihilation operators of the basic mode of the cavity field , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the whole motion of the electron now reads @xmath41 with @xmath42 certainly , a more realistic model should include the cavity mode and electron s interaction with a dissipative environment ( e.g. , the liquid helium and the finite quality factor cavity ) . here , we are interested in the strong coupling regime wherein the dissipation could be neglected . with the pauli and bosonic operators defined above , the positions @xmath6 and @xmath15 can be expressed as @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 . as a consequence",
    ", the hamiltonian ( 6 ) can be rewritten as ( @xmath38 ) @xmath47 where @xmath48 describes the strength of coupling between the electron and cavity field .",
    "@xmath49 , due to _ the broken parities _ of the quantum states of the above 1d hydrogen . finally , @xmath50 ( where @xmath51 is the velocity of light ) is the so - called ld parameter describing the strength of the cavity field induced coupling between the @xmath6- and @xmath15-direction motions of the trapped electron . for the typical parameters @xmath52",
    "v / m and @xmath53  m  @xcite , the @xmath6-direction transition frequency and the @xmath15-direction s vibrational frequency of the electron are estimated as @xmath54  thz and @xmath55  ghz , respectively .",
    "consequently , the above ld parameter @xmath56 for the resonant condition : @xmath57 .",
    "for such a sufficiently small ld parameter , one can perform an approximation @xmath58\\approx1 $ ] ( which means that the cavity - induced interaction between the @xmath6- and @xmath15-direction s motions of the trapped electron is robustly neglected ) .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian ( 9 ) can be further simplified to @xmath59 in the interaction picture defined by @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 assume that the applied the cavity is resonant with the atomic qubit , i.e. , @xmath62 , the famous jcm @xmath63 could be obtained under the usual rotating - wave approximation ( rwa )  @xcite . for an initial state @xmath64 or @xmath65",
    "the time - evolution under the hamiltonian ( 12 ) reads @xmath66 with @xmath67 being the effective rabi frequency , which depends obviously on the initial occupation number @xmath68 of the cavity .",
    "with such a jcm , the coherent vacuum rabi oscillation  @xcite between the present artificial qubit and the vacuum cavity could be presented .",
    "now , we apply an additional classical laser beam : @xmath69 to the floating electron , and then write the total hamiltonian describing the present model as @xmath70 here , @xmath71 , @xmath35 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 are the amplitude , unit polarized vector of @xmath6-direction , wave - vector , frequency , and initial phase of the applied classical laser beam , respectively . @xmath75 describes the coupling strength between the electron and the applied classical laser field .",
    "@xmath76 due to again the broken parities of the quantum states of the 1d hydrogen . also , the new ld parameter @xmath77 describes the strength of the laser induced coupling between the motions of @xmath6-and @xmath15-directions of the trapped electron . again , under the resonant condition : @xmath78 , all the relevant ld parameters are significantly small , i.e. , @xmath79 . as a consequence , @xmath58\\approx 1 $ ] , and thus the hamiltonian ( 15 ) can be simplified to @xmath80 which reduces to @xmath81 in the interaction picture defined by @xmath60 .    under the above resonant condition and the usual rwa , a driven jcm  @xcite :",
    "@xmath82 is realized .",
    "where , the first term corresponds to the jc interaction , and the second term is due to the driving of the classical laser field . the above driven jcm is solvable and the relevant time - evolution operator reads @xmath83 here , @xmath84 is the displacement operator with @xmath85 .",
    "one can easily prove that @xmath86 a potential application of the driven jcm proposed here is that it can be utilized to prepare certain typical nonclassical quantum states ( e.g. , the displaced fock states  @xcite and schr@xmath0dinger cat states  @xcite ) of the thz cavity . in order to implement these preparations",
    ", we first set @xmath87 and perform a basis transformation @xmath88 to rewrite the driven jcm hamiltonian as @xmath89+\\hbar\\omega_{l}\\hat{\\tau}_z\\ ] ] with @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 . in the interaction picture defined by @xmath93",
    ", we have @xmath94.\\ ] ] note that the amplitude @xmath71 of the applied laser field is experimentally controllable , and thus @xmath95 can be effectively increased with the increasing of @xmath71 .",
    "next , let us consider the strong driving case where @xmath96 . under the rwa , the hamiltonian ( 22 ) yields the combination of a jc and an anti - jc interactions  @xcite @xmath97 obviously , if the electron - cavity is initially prepared in @xmath98 , then a coherent state @xmath99 of the thz cavity field can be generated .",
    "on the other hand , if the electron - cavity is initially prepared in @xmath100 , then a schr@xmath0dinger cat state of the thz cavity : @xmath101\\ ] ] is implemented .",
    "furthermore , if the electron is detected in @xmath20 , then the cavity field collapses to the so - called even coherent states ; whereas if the electron is detected in @xmath21 , then the cavity field collapses to the so - called odd coherent states .",
    "in principle , the device proposed here is experimental feasibility .",
    "first , trapping electrons in a small region on the surface of liquid helium by setting suitable micro - electrodes has been experimentally realized  @xcite . for the typical vibrational frequency @xmath55  ghz and transition frequency @xmath54  thz ,",
    "the localization length of the electron moving in the plane is @xmath102  nm , which is far less than that of the size of the corresponding cavity ( it is on the order of wavelength @xmath103  mm ) .",
    "also , the vertical motions of the electron ( which is estimated on the order of @xmath104   ) is far less the typical value of cavity waist ( probably on the order of @xmath105 m ) .",
    "second , the superfluid helium ( @xmath106k ) naturally provides a sufficiently low temperature surrounding of the present system . as consequence",
    ", the thermal noise of the cavity could be well suppressed .",
    "for example , for the thermal state @xmath107e^{-m\\hbar\\omega_c/(k_bt)}|m\\rangle\\langle m|\\ ] ] most of photons are at the vacuum state , e.g. , the probability @xmath108 of the photons at the vacuum state is significantly large : @xmath109 , for the cavity with frequency ( e.g. , @xmath110thz ) . above",
    ", @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the boltzmann constant and temperature of the cavity , respectively .",
    "thirdly , the system proposed here could work in a strong - coupling regime , i , e .",
    ", the interaction strength is sufficiently larger than the decays of the artificial atom and the cavity .",
    "in fact , the decay rate of the above artificial 1d hydrogen is estimated  @xcite to be @xmath113  khz for the typical vibrational frequencies @xmath114  ghz and transition frequency @xmath115  thz .",
    "the main source of the noises on the atom is the so - called ripplons , i.e , the thermally excited surface waves of liquid helium  @xcite .",
    "probably , decay rate of the atom could be significantly decreased by localizing electrons more strongly in the plane ( corresponding to a larger frequency of in - plane vibrations ) .",
    "worthy of note , localizing electrons more strongly in the plane of the liquid helium surface deceases also the ld parameters , making the ld approximations performed above work better .",
    "on the other hand , the decay of the cavity is mainly due to the photon scattering or absorbing on the imperfect cavity mirrors . a high finesse cavity can significantly decrease the decay rate , as @xmath116 . here , @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the length and finesse of the cavity , respectively . for example , the decay rate of the fabry - perot cavity ( with @xmath119  mm and @xmath120 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite is as low as @xmath121  mhz . slightly differing from the cavity in ref .",
    "@xcite , let us consider a cavity with a modest size , e.g. , @xmath122  mm , which is comparable to the typical wave length : @xmath123 , of the present system @xmath54  thz .",
    "the decay rate of this cavity could be further lowered to be @xmath124  mhz . also , the transition matrix element is estimated as @xmath125 and the volume mode of the cavity is @xmath126 for a typical waist @xmath127 m  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the so - called coupling strength could be up to @xmath128 , which is significantly larger than the decay rates of the above atom and cavity . as a consequence  @xcite , the number of photons inside the cavity needed to appreciably affect the electron is calculated as @xmath129 , and the number of electrons needed to appreciably affect the cavity field is @xmath130 .",
    "this implies that the present system could work in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "compared to the usual system of a natural atom interacting with an microwave cavity  @xcite , one of the most advantages of the present system is that it possesses a sufficiently long electron - cavity interaction time .",
    "indeed , the interaction time between the flying atoms and microwave cavity are relatively short ( i.e. , on the order of @xmath131  @xcite ) . in order to increasing cavity - atom interaction time",
    ", the optical lattice technique  ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) have been utilized to trap the atoms in cavities , and the recent experiments showed that such a time can be increased to the order of @xmath132  @xcite . like the trapped ions inside the cavity  @xcite , the present system has sufficiently long electron - cavity interaction time , because the surface - state electron can be , in principle , always trapped in the cavity waist by the applied micro - electrode .    * acknowledgements * : this work is partly supported by the nsfc grant no . 10874142 , 90921010 , and the grant from the major state basic research development program of china ( 973 program ) ( no .",
