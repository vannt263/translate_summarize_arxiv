    "the scientific race in reaching high temperature superconductivity ( @xmath34 ) started by the famous ginzburg s proposal of an _ excitonic mechanism of pairing _ _ in metallic - semiconducting sandwich - structures _",
    "in such a system an electron from the metal tunnels into the semiconducting material and virtually excites high - energy exciton , which is absorbed by another electron , thus making an effective attractive interaction and cooper pairing . however , this beautiful idea has not been realized experimentally until now . in that sense",
    "v. l. ginzburg founded a theoretical group of outstanding and talented physicists , who studied at that time almost all imaginable pairing mechanisms . in this group",
    "an important role has played the ginzburg s collaborator e. g. maksimov , who was an `` inveterate enemy '' of almost all other mechanisms of pairing in @xmath34 but for the electron - phonon one - see his arguments in @xcite .",
    "it seems that the recent discovery of superconductivity in a @xmath35-based material made of one monolayer film of the iron - selenide @xmath4 grown on the @xmath5 substrate - further called @xmath36 @xmath37 , with the critical temperature @xmath38 @xmath17 @xcite , as well as grown on the rutile @xmath6 ( 100 ) substrate with @xmath39 @xmath17 @xcite - further called @xmath36 @xmath40 , in some sense reconciles the credence of these two outstanding physicists .",
    "namely , @xmath34 is realized in a sandwich - structure but the pairing is due to an high - energy ( @xmath41 @xmath8 ) _ oxygen optical phonon_. this ( experimental ) discovery will certainly revive discussions on the role of the electron - phonon interaction ( @xmath0 ) in @xmath34  cuprates and in bulk materials of the @xmath35-pnictides ( with the basic unit @xmath42 ) and fe - chalcogenides ( with the basic unit @xmath43 or @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) . as a digression , we point out that after the discovery of high @xmath46 in @xmath35-pnictides a non - phononic pairing mechanism was proposed immediately , which is due to : @xmath47 ) nesting properties of the electron- and hole - fermi surfaces and ( @xmath48 ) an enhanced ( due to ( @xmath49 ) ) spin exchange interaction ( @xmath50 ) between electrons and holes @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is called the _ nesting sfi pairing_. however , the discovery of alkaline iron selenides @xmath51 with @xmath52 @xmath17 , and intercalated compounds @xmath53 , @xmath54 , which contain _ only electron - like fermi surfaces _ , rules out the nesting pairing mechanism as a common pairing mechanism in fe - based materials . in order to overcome this inadequacy of the @xmath50 nesting mechanism a pure phenomenological `` strong coupling '' @xmath50 pairing",
    "is proposed in the framework of the so called @xmath55 heisenberg - like hamiltonian , which may describe the @xmath21-wave superconductivity , too .",
    "however , this approach is questionable since the lda calculations can not be mapped onto a heisenberg model and there is a need to introduce further terms in form of biquadratic exchange @xcite .",
    "it is interesting , that immediately after the discovery of high @xmath46 in pnictides the electron - phonon pairing mechanism was rather uncritically discarded .",
    "this attitude was exclusively based on the @xmath56 band structure calculations of the electron - phonon coupling constant @xcite , which in this approach turns out to be rather small @xmath57 , thus giving @xmath58 @xmath17 .    in the past",
    "there were only few publications trying to argue that the @xmath0 pairing mechanism is an important ( pairing ) ingredient in the @xmath35-based superconductors @xcite-@xcite .",
    "one of the theoretical arguments for it , may be ilustrated in the case of 2-band superconductivity . in the weak - coupling limit @xmath46",
    "is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "in the nesting @xmath50 pairing mechanism one assumes a dominance of the repulsive inter - band pairing ( @xmath61,@xmath62 ) , i.e. @xmath63 . since the intra - band pairing depends on @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the intra - band @xmath0 coupling constant and @xmath66 is an screened intra - band coulomb repulsion , then in order to maximize @xmath46 the intra - band @xmath0 coupling it is wishful that @xmath65 at least compensate negative effects of @xmath67 ( on @xmath46 ) , i.e. @xmath68 . since in a narrow band one expects rather large screened coulomb repulsion @xmath67 ( @xmath69 ) then the intra - band @xmath0 coupling should be also appreciable",
    ". moreover , from the experimental side the raman measurements in fe - pnictides @xcite give strong evidence for a large phonon line - width of some @xmath70 modes ( where the @xmath71 vibration along the c - axis dominates ) .",
    "they are almost @xmath72 times larger than the @xmath56 band structure calculations predict . in @xcite a model was proposed where high electronic polarizability of @xmath71 ( @xmath73 @xmath74 ) ions screens the hubbard repulsion and also give rise to a strong @xmath0 with a@xmath75 ( mainly @xmath71 ) modes . an appreciable @xmath71 isotope effect in @xmath20",
    "was proposed in @xcite , where the stable @xmath76 should be replaced by unstable @xmath77 - with the life - time of @xmath78 days , quite enough for performing relevant experiments .",
    "the situation is similar with @xmath43 compounds , where an appreciable @xmath0 is expected , since @xmath79 is also highly polarizable ( @xmath80 @xmath74 ) and can be replaced by a long - living @xmath81 isotope - the half - time @xmath82 days .",
    "unfortunately these experiments were never performed .",
    "we end up this digression by paying attention to some known facts , that the @xmath56 band structure calculations are unreliable in treating most high @xmath46 superconductors , since as a rule @xmath56 _ underestimates non - local exchange - correlation effects and overestimates charge screening effects _ - both effects contribute significantly to the @xmath0 coupling constant . as a result , @xmath56 strongly underestimates the @xmath0 coupling in a number of superconductors , especially in those near a metal - isolator transition .",
    "the classical examples for this claim are : ( _ i _ ) the @xmath83superconductor with @xmath84 @xmath17 which is @xmath17-doped from the parent isolating state @xmath85 . here , @xmath56 predicts @xmath86 and @xmath87 @xmath17 , while the theories with an appropriate non - local exchange - correlation potential @xcite predict @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xmath17 ; ( _ ii _ ) the high temperature superconductors , for instance @xmath90 with @xmath91 @xmath17 , whose parent compound @xmath92 is the mott - insulator @xcite , @xcite .    after this digression we consider the main subject of the paper - _ the role of the",
    "_ @xmath0 _ _  with forward scattering peak ( _ _ @xmath1 _ _ ) in pairing mechanism _ _ of the @xmath36 @xmath37 ( and also @xmath36 @xmath40 ) superconductor(s ) with high critical temperatures @xmath38 @xmath17 . in that respect , numerous experiments on @xmath36 @xmath37 ( and also on@xmath36 @xmath40 ) , combined with the fact that the @xmath4 film on the graphene substrate has rather small @xmath93 @xmath17 ( like in the bulk @xmath4 ) , give strong evidence that interface effects , due to @xmath5 ( and @xmath6 ) , are most probably responsible for high @xmath46 .",
    "it turns out , that the most important results in @xmath36 @xmath37 ( and also @xmath36 @xmath40 ) , related to the existence of quasi - particle _ replica bands _ - which are identical to the main quasiparticle band @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , can be coherently described by the @xmath32 _ _  _ _ theory .",
    "this approach was proposed in seminal papers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the beauty of these papers lies in the fact that they have recognized sharp replica bands in the @xmath94 spectra and related them to a sharp forward scattering peak in the @xmath0 .",
    "( this is a very good example for a constructive cooperation of experimentalists and theoreticians . )",
    "let us mention , that the @xmath32 theory was first studied in a connection with @xmath34 cuprates @xcite , while the extreme case of the @xmath32 pairing mechanism with delta - peak is elaborated in @xcite - see a review in @xcite .",
    "physically , this ( in some sense exotic ) interaction means that in some specific materials ( for instance in cuprates and in @xmath36 @xmath37 ) electron pairs exchange virtual phonons with small ( transfer ) momenta @xmath95 only , and as a result the effective pairing potential becomes long - ranged in real space @xcite .",
    "it turns out that this kind of pairing can in some cases give rise to higher @xmath46 than in the standard ( migdal - eliashberg ) @xmath96-like theory .",
    "namely , in the @xmath32 pairing mechanism one has @xmath97 @xcite - see below , instead of the @xmath96 dependence @xmath98 . here ,",
    "@xmath99 and @xmath100 are the corresponding _ mass - independent _",
    "@xmath0 coupling constants , where @xmath101 - is the phonon energy , @xmath102 - the electronic density of states ( per spin ) at the fermi surface .",
    "so , even for small @xmath103 the case @xmath104 can be in principle realized .",
    "we inform the reader in advance , that the @xmath32 theory predicts also that @xmath105 , ( @xmath106 is the dimensionality of the system ) , which means that when @xmath107 high @xmath108 is hardly possible in @xmath109 systems .",
    "however , the detrimental effect of the phase - volume factor @xmath110 on @xmath108 can be compensated by its linear dependence on the pairing potential @xmath14 . in some favorable materials",
    "this competition may lead even to an increase of @xmath46 .",
    "we stress that properties of the superconductors with the @xmath32 mechanism of pairing are in many respects very different from the standard ( bcs - like ) superconductors , and it is completely justified to speak about _",
    "exotic superconductors_. for instance , the @xmath32 theory @xcite-@xcite predicts , that in superconductors with the @xmath32 pairing _ the isotope effect should be small _ in leading order , i.e. @xmath111 @xcite-@xcite - see discussion in the following .",
    "this result is contrary to the case of the isotropic @xmath0 theory in standard metallic superconductors , where @xmath112 is maximal , @xmath113 ( for @xmath114 ) .",
    "we point out , that the @xmath32 pairing mechanism in strongly correlated systems is rather strange in comparison with the corresponding one in standard metals with good electronic screening , where the large transfer momenta dominate and the pairing interaction is , therefore , short - range . as a result , an important consequence of the @xmath32 pairing mechanism in case of @xmath34-cuprates is that @xmath46 in the @xmath22-wave channel is of the same order as in the @xmath21-wave one .",
    "since the residual repulsion is larger in the @xmath21- than in the @xmath22-channel ( @xmath115 ) this result opens a door for @xmath22-wave pairing in @xmath34-cuprates , in spite of the fact of the @xmath0 dominance @xcite-@xcite .    in the following , we study the superconductivity in @xmath36 @xmath37 ( and @xmath36 @xmath40 @xcite ) in the framework of a semi - microscopic model of @xmath0 first proposed in seminal papers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "namely , due to oxygen vacancies : @xmath116 an electronic doping of the @xmath4 monolayer is realized , which gives rise to electronic - like bands centered at the @xmath117-points in the brillouin zone , while the top of the hole - bands are at around @xmath118 @xmath8 below the electronic - like fermi surface ; @xmath119 the formed charge in the interface orders dipoles in the nearby @xmath6 layer ; @xmath120 the free charges in @xmath5 screen the dipolar field in the bulk , thus leaving the @xmath6 dipolar layer near the interface as an important source for the epi . the oxygen ions in the @xmath6",
    "dipolar layer vibrate with high - energy @xmath121 @xmath8 , thus making a long - range dipolar electric field acting on metallic electrons in the @xmath4 monolayer .",
    "this gives rise to a long - ranged @xmath0 @xcite , @xcite , which in the momentum space gives a forward scattering peak - the @xmath32 _ _  pairing mechanism__.    in this paper we make some analytical calculations in the framework of the @xmath32 theory with a very narrow @xmath122-peak , with the width @xmath123 , wher @xmath124 is the fermi momentum @xcite . here",
    ", we enumerate the obtained results , only : ( @xmath125 ) in leading order the _ critical temperature _ is linearly dependent on the pairing potential @xmath126 , i.e. @xmath127 . in order to obtain @xmath16",
    "@xmath17 we set the range of semi - microscopic parameters ( @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 - see below ) entering @xmath133 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath133 is independent of the the oxygen ( @xmath134 ) mass , then @xmath20 is _ mass - independent _ in leading order with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "this means , that in @xmath36 @xmath37 ( and @xmath36 @xmath40 ) one expects very small @xmath134-isotope effect ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "note , in @xcite large @xmath136 is found ; ( @xmath137 ) the _ self - energy _",
    "@xmath138  at @xmath23",
    "is calculated analytically which gives : ( @xmath49 ) the positions and spectral weights of the replica and quasiparticle bands at @xmath23 - all this quantities are _ mass - dependent _ ; ( @xmath48 ) the slope of the quasiparticle self - energy for @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) is _ mass - dependent _ , since @xmath141 ; ( @xmath142 ) in the @xmath32 model ( without other interactions ) the critical temperature for @xmath21-wave and @xmath22-wave pairing is degenerate , i.e. @xmath143 . the presence of non - magnetic impurities ( with the parameter @xmath144 ) lifts this degeneracy .",
    "it is shown , that even the @xmath21-wave pairing ( in the @xmath32 pairing mechanism ) is sensitive to non - magnetic impurities , which are _ pair - weakening _ for it , i.e. @xmath145 is decreased for large @xmath146 , but never vanishes .",
    "it is also shown that for @xmath22-wave pairing @xmath147 strongly depends on impurities , which are _ pair - breaking_. the curiosity is that in the presence of non - magnetic impurities @xmath147 in the @xmath32 pairing mechanism is more robust than the corresponding one in the @xmath96 model ; ( @xmath148 ) the long - range @xmath32 pairing potential in real space makes a short - range potential in the momentum space . the latter gives rise to numerous low - laying excitation energy ( above the ground - state ) of pairs , thus leading to strong internal pair fluctuations which reduce @xmath20 . at @xmath33 a pseudogap behavior is expected .",
    "the structure of the paper is following : in _ section ii _",
    "we calculate the @xmath32 pairing potential as a function of semi - microscopic parameters in the model of a dipolar layer @xmath6 with vibrations qf the oxygen ions @xcite-@xcite . in _ section iii _ the self - energy effects , such as replica bands and their intensities at @xmath23 , are studied .",

    "it is important to point out that in @xmath36 @xmath37 material , with @xmath150-monolayer of @xmath4 grown on the @xmath5 substrate - mainly on the @xmath151 plane , the fermi surface in the @xmath4 monolayer is _ _ electron - like  _ _ and",

    "the absence of the ( nested ) hole - bands on the fermi surface rules out all @xmath50 nesting theories of pairing .",
    "even the pairing between an electron- and incipient hole - band @xcite is ineffective since : ( @xmath150 ) in the @xmath4 monolayer the top of the hole band lies below the fermi level around @xmath152 @xmath8 ; ( @xmath153 ) because of ( @xmath150 ) the sfi coupling constant is ( much ) smaller than in the nesting case .",
    "this brings into play the interface interaction effects .",
    "the existence of _ sharp replica bands _ in the @xmath19 spectra at energies of the order of optical phonons with @xmath154 @xmath8 , implies inevitably that the dominant interaction in @xmath36 @xmath37 ( and also in @xmath36 @xmath40 @xcite ) is due to @xmath0 with strong forward scattering peak @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the physical mechanism for @xmath32 is material dependent and the basic physical quantities such as the width of the @xmath1 , phonon frequencies and bare @xmath0 coupling can vary significantly from material to material .",
