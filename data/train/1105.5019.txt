    "radio pulsars are highly periodic variable astrophysical objects , powered by neutron stars rotation with periods evolving with time",
    ". observational determination of their timing parameters  instantaneous period and its derivatives  is an extremely complex task @xcite , but after the correction of pulse times of arrivals ( toas ) for the effects of radio wave propagation in the interstellar medium , motion and position of the earth , gravitational delays in solar system potential etc .",
    ", the resulting phase of the light curve may be well described by an ( infinite ) taylor series @xmath10 dominated by the lower order terms .",
    "this may also be expressed in terms of observed rotational frequency as @xmath11 where values of @xmath12 and its derivatives are attributed to the epoch @xmath13 .    at the same time , the majority of published theoretical models of pulsar braking predict the spin - down described by a differential equation of the form @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a ( constant ) braking index and @xmath16 depends on the individual physical properties of the pulsar . for the vacuum magnetodipolar model the canonical value is @xmath17 , pulsar wind decreases it to @xmath18 and",
    "multipole magnetic field increases it to @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "for such a spin - down with _ constant _ @xmath16 the braking index is equal to a simple combination of frequency and two its derivatives ) broken down to the third order term , are always biased even if the spin - down is exactly according to equation ( [ eq_dipole ] ) due to influence of non - zero higher - order terms . for actual pulsars , however , this bias is negligible and will be ignored below . ]",
    "@xmath20 that is why the determination of spin frequency second derivative via pulsar timing is important for understanding the pulsar spin - down .",
    "several decades of very detailed timing of hundreds of pulsars @xcite , including the best studied one  crab pulsar @xcite  demonstrated , however , that the measured rotational phase ( [ eq_phi_series ] ) evolution is not generally consistent with the one expected for a braking law ( [ eq_dipole ] ) with physically reasonable parameters . observed rotational phase @xmath21 ( as well as @xmath12 , @xmath8 ) includes components with a very complex , irregular behaviour .",
    "the first kind of such irregularities is `` glitches ''  sporadic fast changes of pulsars periods and spin - down rate with up to few months relaxation timescale ( e.g. @xcite ) , while the other one  quasi - random phase variations with typically red fourier spectrum and characteristic timescales of a few months to few years  `` timing noise '' ( e.g @xcite ) .    both of them affect the measurements of @xmath12 , @xmath8 and @xmath1 , and often make them dependent on the duration and epoch @xmath13 of the observations time span , when it is shorter or comparable to timescales of these processes .",
    "but , if observations are performed over sufficiently long intervals of about a decade or longer , the observed coefficients of series ( [ eq_phi_series ] ) become more stable  the influence of these irregularities is mostly suppressed ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec_f2data ] for additional discussion ) . to date",
    ", there are more than 200 pulsars observed for longer than 15 years @xcite , and still the majority of @xmath1 values , measured over such long intervals , lead to extremely high , up to @xmath22 ( and even more ) , braking indices .",
    "moreover , their values are negative for nearly a half of all objects . in general , measured braking indices drastically differ from physically reasonable values , and this raises serious problem on the pulsars long term spin evolution .    while glitches are widely believed to be caused by a rapid transfer of momentum from the neutron stars interior ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , the nature of the timing noise is still unclear and no self - consistent and widely accepted model of pulsars phase residuals irregularities is constructed .",
    "there have been numerous attempts to attribute it to various stochastic phenomena in the neutron star magnetosphere @xcite , in the interior @xcite , to spin - down torque variations @xcite , and to the existence of a number of different spin - down regimes for a single pulsar @xcite .",
    "purely phenomenological attempts to describe observed noise as random walks of different orders ( in phase , frequency or its derivative ) @xcite have also not succeeded as with the increase of observations time spans the noise appeared to be more complex than these simple models predict .",
    "some characteristics of this essentially irregular process , however , have been parametrized through several noise strength parameters and their correlations .",
    "so , @xcite parametrized pulsars timing noise through @xmath23 quantity and found a good @xmath24 correlation , where @xmath25 is a pulsar period .    in turn , @xcite , @xcite and",
    "then @xcite have investigated activity parameter @xmath26 , which is a direct measure of timing residuals variance .",
    "a good correlations of @xmath26 versus @xmath8 and @xmath1 was also found .    however , the quantities used in these papers to parametrize timing noise were in fact just the measures of observed frequency second derivative .",
    "even the activity parameter @xmath26 was calculated using timing residuals after subtraction of a second order polynomial in series ( [ eq_phi_series ] ) .",
    "therefore , the correlations obtained simply reflect the quite strong @xmath2 dependence .    at the same time , only a few long - term mechanisms have been offered to explain observed anomalous braking indices .",
    "@xcite studied the variations of pulsar timing parameters due to existence of possible massive partner ",
    "most of radio pulsars are , however , believed to be isolated objects .",
    "@xcite investigated the impact of unresolved or missed glitches on the observed timing parameters , but it is very difficult to explain some extremely high braking indices @xmath27 by such mechanism .",
    "@xcite considered variations of pulsar braking torque with timescales of @xmath28 years , probably due to interaction of the pulsar with interstellar medium in its vicinity .",
    "the idea of spin - down torque variations itself is quite promising and reasonable , but the nature of variations on such timescale was not pointed out in their note and remained unclear .    in turn , in @xcite and @xcite we considered the existence of a long - term cyclic variational process affecting pulsars spin - down on a timescale of thousands of years .",
    "one may call such a process a third type of timing irregularities .",
    "later , @xcite suggested that the physical nature of such a process may be related to the `` anomalous '' magnetodipolar braking torque , which may produce a forced precession of pulsar s rotational axis around its magnetic moment with the period of @xmath6 years , and demonstrated the possibility of significant variations of observed rotational parameters on such timescale .",
    "even earlier , @xcite also investigated the triaxial neutron star rotation taking into account this torque and demonstrated that the rotation of such star may be very complex and even induce variations of magnetic inclination angle , which will also affect the neutron star spin - down .",
    "as a further development of this concept of a long - term variational process , in the current work we analyse the ensemble of 297 pulsars with published data on second frequency derivatives and demonstrate that these values may be used to estimate the parameters of both secular ( evolutionary , monotonous ) and additional , cyclic , components of a pulsar spin - down under simple and reasonable assumptions .",
    "we formulate such a two - component model of pulsar braking and derive its parameters using a maximum likelihood estimator .",
    "the results are quite reasonable , as the parameters of monotonous component are in a good agreement with a standard magnetodipolar spin - down model . the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_data ]",
    "we justify that measured @xmath1 values can indeed be used to analyse pulsars spin - down . in section  [ sec_statistics ] , statistical analysis of a 297 objects is performed , phenomenology of a two - component pulsars spin - down is presented and parameters of its irregular term are roughly estimated using model - independent arguments . in section  [ sec_model ] this two - component model is used for the determination of the secular spin - down parameters also . in section  [ sec_discuss ]",
    "we discuss the results and its astrophysical implications .",
    "the conclusions are given in section  [ sec_conclude ] .",
    "anomalous values of @xmath1 ( and braking indices ) for most of ordinary pulsars raise at least two principal questions , critical for any serious analysis of these quantities .",
    "namely :    * are values measured over long timespans ( decades ) really related to pulsars or interstellar medium physics or they are just artifacts of somewhat incorrect observations and/or data reduction ?    and",
    "* if they are not artifacts , then is the anomaly induced by the same phenomena responsible for the short time scale ( months ) quasi - periodic timing irregularities with red - like spectra , observed in timing residuals ?",
    "the answer to the first question above is clear .",
    "pulsar timing is a complex , but well - defined and thoroughly described procedure , and the sources of observational uncertainties arising in it are well known and are taken into account during the reduction , as well as various effects that affect the timing systematically ",
    "e.g. motion of the earth , relativistic effects , etc ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "there is no reason to believe the significant cubic trends , clearly seen in phase solutions for hundreds of pulsars @xcite , are artifacts .",
    "there is also a method for indirect measurements of a pulsar second derivative by comparing @xmath8 values acquired over sufficiently distant , separated by @xmath29 years , time spans @xcite . results of such estimation are anomalous too , and are generally consistent with directly measured values .    obviously , all accurately measured @xmath1 values , even being anomalous , are physically meaningful ",
    "they are indeed due to peculiarities of pulsars spin down , while their anomalousness is just an indication of insufficiency of our models of pulsars braking .",
    "on the other hand , the answer to the second question is not so obvious , as stochastic timing irregularities , seen in a large fraction of pulsars , still are not well understood and are complex phenomena .",
    "phenomenologically , timing residuals irregularities and unexpected anomalous parameters of timing solution have to be separated in the analysis .",
    "indeed , the former ones are seen directly within observational datasets and their stochastic nature is clear while the origin of the latter ones can only be speculated about .",
    "below we argue in favour of indeed different origins of these phenomena .    the phase residuals after all appropriate corrections and quadratic trend subtraction ( i.e. after extraction of @xmath12 and @xmath8 only ) form a very plural zoo over the pulsar population",
    ". there are at least several different classes of typical pulsars timing series ( see figure 3 in @xcite )  the ones with dominant influence of a cubic term ( e.g. psrs b0959 - 54 , b0943 + 10 , b1657 - 13 etc . ) , the ones with more complex but generally smooth behaviour ( psrs b1620 - 26 , b1706 - 16 , b1727 - 47 etc . ) , and the ones that are purely white noise supposedly due to measurement errors .",
    "the latter class typically contains pulsars with inaccurate or unmeasured second frequency derivatives , and will not be analysed here .",
    "the second one is often used to depict the timing deviations from an expected spin - down law as a process with red noise - like spectrum ; there are , however , some evidences that this behaviour in fact is a combination of a cubic order term and a quasi - periodic component @xcite .",
    "moreover , young pulsars ( e.g. crab , b1509 - 58 , b2011 + 38 ) show strong short - term quasi - periodic timing noise , along with cubic trends corresponding to a spin - down with physically meaningful braking indices @xmath30 @xcite .    also",
    ", the behaviour of @xmath1 s with the increase of observational span is not consistent with their origin due to stochastic or short timescale noise processes .",
    "for example , for psr b1706 - 16 , variations of @xmath31 with an amplitude of @xmath32 s@xmath33 have been detected on a timescale of several years ( see figure  7 in @xcite )  its values , however , are always around the one revealed by the fit over the entire 25 year time span ( @xmath34 s@xmath33 ) , which still leads to a braking index @xmath35 .    all this strongly suggest that timing noise is a process distinct from the one producing large ( and anomalous ) cubic trends in  ; this noise acts mostly as a randomizing factor decreasing the accuracy of @xmath1 measurements , but not defining their properties in general .    as a result , we believe the second derivative values to be very promising tool for studying long timescale features of pulsars spin - down . although the @xmath1 values of individual pulsars bring little information on the spin - down of neutron stars , the properties of its distribution over an _",
    "ensemble _ of all pulsars seems to be appropriate for spin - down study under a simple and reasonable assumptions on the properties of process producing these anomalous cubic trends .",
    "the set of pulsars under investigation is similar to the one used in our previous works @xcite . from the 393 objects of the atnf catalogue @xcite with known @xmath31 we have compiled a list of `` ordinary '' radio pulsars",
    "that    * have @xmath36 ms and @xmath37 s / s ( i.e. had not been recycled ) ; * have relative accuracy of second derivative measurements better than 75% ; * are not components of binary systems and not in a list of known anomalous x - ray pulsars .    19 supplementary pulsars from other sources @xcite have been added .",
    "the final set consists of 297 objects including 247 from @xcite .",
    "18 of them are associated with young supernova remnants",
    "our work is based on the study of relations between quantities derived from pulsars timing : spin frequency , its two derivatives @xmath8 and @xmath1 , observed braking index @xmath39 and characteristic age @xmath40 .",
    "as we previously demonstrated in @xcite , the logarithms of @xmath41 show significant correlation with the ones of @xmath42 for both positive ( 172 pulsars , correlation coefficient @xmath43 ) and negative ( 125 pulsars , @xmath44 ) branches of the @xmath2 diagram ( figure  [ fig_diagram ] ) .",
    "the apparent separation of branches on the @xmath45 diagram is primarily due to the logarithmic scale of the plot , and actually objects continuously cover the full range of @xmath31 values , excluding only the gap on small ones due to limited accuracy of measurements ( which is not better than @xmath46 @xmath47 ) .",
    "young pulsars confidently associated with supernova remnants are systematically shifted to the left on the diagram ( open symbols in figure  [ fig_diagram ] ) and are absent on the right .",
    "hence , pulsars seem to evolve towards lower values of @xmath48 . moreover , if @xmath49 is an appropriate pulsar age estimator , then @xmath48 is the same too , as they are highly correlated ( @xmath50 in logarithmic scale , see fig .",
    "[ fig_f1_tau ] )    on the @xmath3 diagram , shown in figure  [ fig_f2f0 ] , pulsars behaviour is similar : they are born with higher values of @xmath12 and , since @xmath51 , evolve toward lower values .",
    "the direction of the evolution is the same for positive and negative branches of @xmath3 .",
    "so all older pulsars have systematically lower values of @xmath41 which is consistent with evolutionary interpretation of @xmath2 diagram .",
    "so , we conclude that each pulsar during its evolution moves along the branches of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 diagrams while its @xmath52 value increases and @xmath12 value decreases .",
    "however , on the negative branch of @xmath2 , the value of the first derivative , being negative too , can only decrease with time , since @xmath31 is a formal derivative of @xmath52 , and both of them are regular components of the observed rotational phase ( [ eq_phi_series ] ) .",
    "so , pulsar motion along the branch may only be backward , which clearly contradicts its evolutionary interpretation suggested earlier .",
    "the solution we offer is to assume a _",
    "behaviour of pulsars on this diagram .",
    "as pulsars evolve , they repeatedly change sign of @xmath31 , in a spiral - like motion from branch to branch , and spend roughly half their lifetime on each one .",
    "such behaviour is sketched in figure  [ fig_sketch ] .",
    "the timescale of such variations has to be much shorter than the pulsar life time , and at the same time significantly larger than the one of the observations to systematically affect the timing solution .",
    "of course , such cyclic behaviour should also affect other spin - down parameters  @xmath12 and @xmath8 .",
    "then , on @xmath4 plot , shown in figure  [ fig_f0f1 ] , pulsars move from bottom right to the upper left , from high to low @xmath12 and @xmath48 , forming quasi - evolutionary sequence , with linear regression coefficient @xmath53 in logarithmic scale .",
    "unfortunately , this diagram itself ca nt be used to study the spin - down evolution of pulsars , as it is distorted by various selection effects ( death line crossing , emission beam width dependency on pulsar frequency @xcite , etc ) and correlation of pulsars initial @xmath12 and @xmath8 at birth .",
    "now we introduce an appropriate phenomenological description of the complex timing evolution of pulsars including the cyclic variations we proposed above .",
    "the exact form of a pulsar s trajectory on the @xmath2 diagram is unknown , but in general its rotational evolution may be described as the superposition of the regular component of the observed rotational phase @xmath54 , and an irregular , _ cyclic _",
    "one @xmath55 : @xmath56 where @xmath57 over a long enough time interval @xmath58 comparable to a pulsar s lifetime .",
    "after term by term differentiation of equation ( [ eq_phi_decomp ] ) one gets : @xmath59 for the rotational frequency and @xmath60    \\label{eq_dnu_decomp}\\ ] ] for the spin - down rate @xmath8 . obviously , due to secular loss of rotational energy , the value of @xmath61 should be always negative for an isolated pulsar .",
    "quantity @xmath62 is a spin - down rate relative deviation , which is not necessarily small , and is likely greater than -1 : @xmath63 due to the absence of `` ordinary '' pulsars with @xmath64 in the subset under investigation .",
    "it is clear that deviation @xmath65 is also cyclic ; in the simplest case it is a harmonic function of variational phase @xmath66 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath26 is the relative amplitude of the @xmath8 oscillations , related to the absolute amplitude @xmath69 : @xmath70    by second differentiation of equation ( [ eq_phi_decomp ] ) for a rotational frequency second derivative we get : @xmath71\\ ] ] where @xmath72 ( i.e. @xmath73 ) for most pulsars , and this is the reason behind anomalously high values of observed @xmath41 and braking indices .",
    "in other words , the absolute amplitude of the @xmath1 variations @xmath74 is much greater than the regular term @xmath75 .",
    "note also that cyclic terms @xmath65 and @xmath76 are not independent  they are connected through the relation : @xmath77    since pulsars secularly evolve to the higher values of @xmath8 and @xmath78 , the sign of @xmath79 should always be positive : @xmath80    such positive contribution should introduce a small asymmetry of the observed values of @xmath1 in respect to @xmath81 , even if the variations of @xmath82 are intrinsically symmetric .",
    "such asymmetry drives the average motion to the right on the @xmath2 diagram and affects the times that pulsars spend with positive and negative @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , numbers of pulsars with positive ( @xmath83 ) and negative ( @xmath84 ) values of @xmath1 within the subset are significantly different .",
    "if this difference is just accidental , its probability is too small , @xmath85 only , assuming binomial distribution of 297 objects with @xmath86 chance to be on a positive branch .",
    "therefore , null hypothesis of exactly symmetric branches is rejected on a @xmath87% significance level , and the branches are indeed asymmetric in number of objects of positive and negative branches on a 2.5% significance level . ] .",
    "we investigated in detail the behaviour of such significance levels for a number of subsets of pulsars with @xmath8 greater than and @xmath12 less then a given value .",
    "corresponding dependencies are plotted in the fig .",
    "[ fig_pvalues ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that branches of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 diagrams are significantly different only when relatively young pulsars are taken into account , while behaviour of the older pulsars seems to be the same for both signs of @xmath1 .",
    "it is consistent with the existence of a positive evolutionary trend @xmath75 , which is negligible for older pulsars , but is large enough to affect the second derivatives of the younger ones .    in other words , for the initial stages of pulsars life , values of @xmath88 are less than @xmath75 ( i.e. @xmath89 ) , and the second derivatives are always positive ( see the upper left region of fig .  [ fig_diagram ] ) .",
    "later on , as @xmath48 decreases , the @xmath75 becomes quite small and the relative deviations @xmath90 grow up extremely over unity ; as a result , observed values of @xmath1 turn out to be significantly different from an intrinsic @xmath75 , and it corresponds to the great increase of their absolute braking indices ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_ntau ] ) .",
    "these different stages of pulsars evolution are illustrated in the fig .",
    "[ fig_sketch ] .    at the same time",
    ", the absence of a significant difference between the @xmath2 branches for relatively old pulsars  their symmetry  implies an important fact that @xmath82 variations are indeed approximately symmetric in respect to evolutionary trend : a pulsar deviates to higher and lower values of @xmath1 with nearly the same amplitude and spends an equal amounts of time with @xmath1 greater and less than @xmath75 .",
    "this fact will be used in section  [ sec_model ] for the estimation of the parameters of pulsars two - component spin - down model .",
    "however , some generic characteristics of the cyclic , irregular component of @xmath1 behaviour  its amplitude and timescale  may be easily derived from an exploratory analysis of the @xmath2 and @xmath5 scatter plots using simple , model - independent arguments .",
    "such analysis is presented in the next two subsections .      as stated above , for the majority of pulsars",
    "the amplitude @xmath74 of the second derivative variations is much greater than the positive evolutionary trend @xmath75 .",
    "all the pulsars on the negative branch of @xmath2 diagram are due to subtraction of this amplitude from the trend .",
    "therefore , the values of @xmath41 of the lower envelope of this branch ( in terms of @xmath41 ) are sensible estimation of a _ lower _ limit on @xmath74 . at the same time , the values of @xmath1 of pulsars near upper envelope of positive branch may be considered an _",
    "upper _ limit of @xmath74 .    indeed , due to existence of the secular trend @xmath91 , the amplitude of the variational term @xmath82 can not exceed the values of @xmath1 s of the upper envelope of the positive branch ( for a given @xmath8 ) . for pulsars there @xmath92 , while for ones on the lower envelope of the negative branch @xmath93 .",
    "we used the boundfit generalized least - squares code developed by @xcite to acquire an analytical expressions for the mentioned envelopes of the negative and positive branches on the @xmath2 diagram , and found them to be @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively .",
    "they are shown as dashed lines in figure  [ fig_diagram ] .    since we consider pulsars on fits ( [ eq_f2bound_low ] ) and ( [ eq_f2bound ] ) to be observed with amplitude values of frequency second derivative , their @xmath1 s are close to turning points , where corresponding @xmath96 change signs during the oscillations ( see also the sketch in figure  [ fig_sketch ] ) , and are obviously small ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "hence , the assumption of @xmath98 in equations ( [ eq_f2bound_low ] ) and ( [ eq_f2bound ] ) is justified .",
    "due to the absence of pulsars with positive @xmath8 , the amplitudes of variations of frequency first derivatives are likely to be less than their secular values : @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "also , for any more or less stable cyclic process , the following relations should be true : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a characteristic frequency of cyclic variations .",
    "( for the special case ( [ eq_eps_cos ] ) these relations are exact ) . for the upper limit @xmath103 while for the lower one @xmath104 .",
    "hence , one can estimate : @xmath105 which leads to upper limit on the timescale @xmath106 : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is normalized to @xmath109 s@xmath110 .",
    "the value of @xmath106 changes from @xmath111 years for oldest to @xmath112 years for youngest pulsars . then , the value of lower limit @xmath113 should depend on the upper limit of @xmath74 and typical minimal relative @xmath96 amplitude @xmath114 : @xmath115 . hence @xmath116 or @xmath117 however , @xmath118 should be more than few times of typical observational span length for the pulsars under investigation , which is @xmath119 years .",
    "hence , @xmath120 and @xmath114 is unlikely less than @xmath121 .",
    "moreover , we will show below that @xmath122 is even greater than @xmath123 .    at the same time , assuming that fit to negative branch of @xmath2 diagram @xmath124 represents in the same way a _ typical _",
    "variational amplitude ( shown as solid line @xmath125 in figure  [ fig_diagram ] ) , one may , in a similar way , estimate a typical timescale able to provide observed @xmath1 spread .",
    "so , @xmath126 or @xmath127 with spread from @xmath128 to @xmath129 years for oldest and youngest objects , respectively .    finally ,",
    "according to equation ( [ eq_tdef ] ) the amplitudes of the pulsars frequency variations should be roughly @xmath130 times the ones of its derivative and @xmath131 times  its second one . for typical maximal timescale ( [ eq_ttyp ] ) : @xmath132 these values do not exceed a few hertz even for young pulsars and significantly less than observed frequencies for most of pulsars .",
    "it justifies the neglection of variational term in the rotational frequency decomposition ( [ eq_nu_decomp ] ) : @xmath133      there are number of widely accepted estimators of pulsars physical properties based on results of timing solution and power - law ( [ eq_dipole ] ) spin - down model with constant @xmath16 and @xmath17 : characteristic age @xmath40 , rotational energy loss rate @xmath134 and surface magnetic field @xmath135    but , if the amplitude of frequency derivative variations , @xmath136 , is large , these quantities may be significantly biased , as they are computed using observed @xmath8 values , and not actual evolutionary ones @xmath108 .    using phenomenology introduced earlier and assuming power - law spin - down defined by equation ( [ eq_dipole ] ) with constant @xmath16 and evolutionary braking index @xmath15 , observed quantities @xmath0 and @xmath49 may be expressed as : @xmath137 and @xmath138 where @xmath139 is pulsar initial period , @xmath140  its real age , and @xmath141 and @xmath142 are relative @xmath8 and @xmath1 deviations according to equations ( [ eq_dnu_decomp ] ) and ( [ eq_ddnu_decomp ] ) .",
    "if @xmath17 , then @xmath143 years for the typical pulsar and @xmath144 for the older objects .",
    "so , if @xmath141 varies in @xmath145 range , then half of pulsars will be observed as up to @xmath146 times older than their true unbiased characteristic ages , while another half as @xmath147 times younger .",
    "the effect is therefore seemingly asymmetric , as characteristic ages will mostly appear overestimated .",
    "the same bias will also appear in the rotational energy loss rate , while magnetic fields will be @xmath148 times underestimated for pulsars with @xmath149 .",
    "moreover , since observed braking indices @xmath150 , their absolute values will be additionally increased up to order of magnitude for a half of pulsars .",
    "since @xmath0 and @xmath49 depend on @xmath65 and @xmath76 , the pulsar behaviour on the @xmath5 plane , shown in figure  [ fig_ntau ] , is similar to that in the @xmath2 one .",
    "the positive and negative branches are not identical : the numbers of pulsars and shapes of branches are significantly different .",
    "the most interesting regions of the diagram are the areas i , ii and iii with the relatively young pulsars .",
    "there are 19 pulsars with positive and only 2 with negative @xmath0 in the area iii ( psr b1338 - 62 and psr b1610 - 50 ) , while satisfying to the formal selection criteria described in sec .",
    "[ subsec_subset ] , have relatively bad data sets  b1338 - 62 shows significant glitch activity , and time spans for both of them are only about 200 days long . ] .",
    "binomial test with @xmath151 rejects the hypothesis of an accidental origin of such asymmetry on a 0.01% significance level .",
    "the pulsars with positive @xmath0 have measured @xmath152 , which are larger than any reasonable secular value .",
    "moreover , they slightly deviate from the rest of positive branch of the diagram .",
    "is it possible to explain these @xmath0 as a result of decay of @xmath16 coefficient in spin - down law ( [ eq_dipole ] ) , probably due to evolution of magnetic inclination angle ( e.g. @xcite ) ? to yield pulsars with both @xmath153 and @xmath154 years , corresponding timescale @xmath155 should be as short as few thousands years only .",
    "however , e.g. @xcite have shown that there is no significant decay of coefficient @xmath16 on a timescale @xmath156 years for isolated pulsars .",
    "we plotted pulsar evolutionary tracks corresponding to spin - down law ( [ eq_dipole ] ) with @xmath17 and @xmath157 and @xmath158 years on the @xmath5 diagram ( blue dashed lines in figure  [ fig_ntau ] ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that first of them is insufficient to explain @xmath0 of pulsars in area iii , while second one is unable to affect observed distribution of pulsars @xmath0 at all .",

    "the unusual timescale of these variations ",
    "thousands of years  is much larger than the pulsar rotational period and , on the other hand , much shorter than its typical lifetime . at the same time",
    ", even the canonical magnetodipolar braking model seems to already include an essential mechanism for long - term variations .",
    "more than half a century ago @xcite derived the vacuum solution for the electromagnetic field of a perfectly conducting , rigidly rotating spherical star .",
    "the full braking torque affecting such a star with magnetic moment @xmath276 and spin angular velocity @xmath277 may be described as a superposition of three orthogonal terms ( in observer s frame ) : @xmath278 where @xmath279 .",

    "the near - field torque is up to four orders of magnitude greater than far - field one .",
    "however , being very strong , this torque does not directly affect pulsar spin - down rate and can not change magnetic inclination angle @xmath284 , as it is always perpendicular to both rotational and magnetic axes , in contrast to the far - field part of the torque driving the evolution of pulsar @xmath285 and @xmath284 @xcite .",
    "this near - field torque induces an additional complex rotation of the star .",
    "indeed , first term of torque ( [ eq_torque ] ) describes a precession of a neutron star around its magnetic axis with angular frequency @xmath286 . due to the strength of the near - field torque ,",
    "the characteristic timescale of this precession is significantly shorter than the pulsars typical lifetime .",
    "precisely , in a simple vacuum magnetodipolar case , precession period remains constant and is equal to @xcite @xmath287 here @xmath288 ",
    "pulsar s initial frequency normalized to @xmath289 ; @xmath290  surface magnetic field normalized to @xmath291 ; @xmath292  ns moment of inertia normalized to @xmath293 , and @xmath281  ns radius normalized to @xmath294 ; @xmath295  initial magnetic inclination angle .",
    "the value of @xmath296 depends strongly on the ns parameters , hence one can expect a wide range of precession periods , from hundreds to thousands years . the distribution of these periods for reasonable values of ns parameters is shown in figure  [ fig_omegas ] and is in a good agreement with estimations of variational process timescales derived in this work .",
    "note , that similar long - term precession on a timescales of few thousand years can be also caused by the ns distortion along the magnetic axis due to the strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , if we associate pulsar beam symmetry axis with ns magnetic moment then it is possible to show that such ns precession itself can not cause large observed deviations of @xmath1 ( and @xmath8 )  moreover , it is unable to power a cyclic variations in observed ns spin - down rate at all .",
    "indeed , the braking torque vector ( [ eq_torque ] ) is dominated by the strong near - field term .",
    "hence , assuming @xmath297 and @xmath298 : @xmath299 where @xmath300 is a constant precession frequency .",
    "at the same time , observed pulsar spin frequency is defined by rotation of @xmath276 .",
    "however , this vector rotates around angular velocity @xmath277 : @xmath301 which also changes its direction relative to observer .",
    "therefore , the value of _ observed _ spin frequency of @xmath302 is not equal to @xmath285 and is not clear from equations ( [ eq_dotomega ] ) and ( [ eq_dotmu ] ) only .    but , combining these two equations we found that @xmath303 , which suggests introduction of the vector @xmath304 which is useful for the description of @xmath302 rotation by a simpler equation similar to ( [ eq_dotmu ] ) : @xmath305 since @xmath306 , it is clear that a star precessing around its magnetic axis looks like a non - precessing star with a bit biased observed spin frequency @xmath307 where @xmath284 is a magnetic inclination angle",
    ".    therefore , even slow _",
    "monotonous _ evolution of @xmath256 , @xmath285 and @xmath284 are unable to introduce any irregularities in observed spin - down rate .",
    "the discussed type of precession is indiscernible for an observer .",
    "therefore , if observed long - term spin - down variations are really caused by such precession , some geometrical or physical mechanism connecting rotation of @xmath277 around @xmath302 with modulation of @xmath284 , @xmath308 etc should be suggested .",
    "thus , @xcite considered an alteration of electric currents in the ns magnetosphere caused by such precession , which leads to modulation of @xmath308 . at the same time , @xcite have shown that for non - spherical but biaxial or triaxial ns , near - field torque will strongly affect its rotation . if pulsar s rotational axis ( and magnetic moment ) significantly deviates from the one of its main inertia axes , then a very large variations of @xmath284 ( and consequently of @xmath308 ) occur .",
    "however , variations so large are not observed @xcite .",
    "generally , any change in the observed pulsar timing parameters are determined by the variations of the @xmath309 , where @xmath310 is the dihedral angle between two planes  the plane of symmetry axis of a pulsar beam and the plane formed by rotational axis and direction to the observer .",
    "detailed investigations of observed complex timing behaviour should always take into account the geometry of pulsar emission .    ultimately , whether the monotonous precession of ns rotation axis around the magnetic moment able to produce any non - monotonous peculiarities in observed @xmath8 and @xmath1 is not clear , but at least this process operates on sufficiently long timescales of thousands of years . on the other hand ,",
    "there are no obvious physical reason behind some hypothetical stochastic process with ultra - red spectrum , able to produce the same amplitude of pulsars second derivatives variations .",
    "the regular nature of these variations seems phenomenologically preferable .",

    "<S> we discuss the possible physical connection of long term oscillation with a complex neutron star rotation relative its magnetic axis due to influence of the near - field part of magnetodipolar torque .    </S>",
