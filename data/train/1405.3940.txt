    "experimentally we measure a time - integrated history of the emission .",
    "photons from hadron decays need to be removed to reveal the so - called direct contribution , i.e. photons that are produced before the formation of the matter as well as from the matter itself .",
    "further removal of the early component , usually considered prompt production from @xmath8 scattering of the partons from the incoming nuclei , gives access to the radiation emitted from the matter .",
    "if the matter is in local equilibrium the photon spectrum is a time - integrated image of the evolution of the temperature and collective motion of the matter as it expands and cools .",
    "phenix discovered evidence of thermal photons from collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite ; similar findings have recently been reported by alice from collisions at the large hadron collider  @xcite .",
    "photons in both energy regimes exhibit a large yield and an azimuthal anisotropy  @xcite with respect to the reaction plane , often referred to as elliptic flow and quantified as @xmath9 . comparing the measured spectra to model calculations of thermal photons based on a hydrodynamic evolution of the system , microscopic transport models , or a more schematic time evolution gives reasonable agreement when assuming an initial temperature of 300  mev or above  @xcite for @xmath10  gev @xmath11 collisions at rhic .",
    "however , it is a challenge for these types of models to simultaneously explain the large observed azimuthal anisotropy of the radiation and the large yield  @xcite .    the challenge for these model calculations results from the interplay between the time evolution of the collective motion and the cooling of the matter that emits photons . in the model calculations , the collective motion builds up over time .",
    "the flow velocity is initially small and increases throughout the collision as the matter continues to expand .",
    "the yield of thermal photons is expected to be largest early in the collision when the matter is the hottest .",
    "theoretical models that create large photon @xmath9 typically underestimate the direct photon yield .",
    "attempts to improve hydrodynamic models by implementing next - to - leading - order thermal rates  @xcite , initial state fluctuations  @xcite , formation time effects  @xcite , increased radial flow and enhanced coupling at @xmath12  @xcite , fail to reconcile yield and anisotropy .    to resolve this puzzle ,",
    "new production mechanisms have been proposed .",
    "some enhance the thermal yield in the presence of the strong magnetic field perpendicular to the reaction plane , which creates a large anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "other new mechanisms , such as synchrotron radiation  @xcite at the plasma boundary or photon production in a glasma phase  @xcite , create an anisotropy due to the initial geometry of the overlap region .",
    "in this paper we present the first measurement of low momentum real direct photons from collisions at 200 gev center of mass energy .",
    "this measurement compliments earlier measurements of direct photons that were obtained by extrapolating low mass virtual photons to the real photon point @xcite .",
    "we are able to extend the range down to 0.4 gev / c and provide new information on the centrality dependence of the direct photon yield .",
    "in particular , the centrality dependence holds the promise to help to distinguish between different production mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "to measure direct photons , we analyzed large data samples of @xmath13 and @xmath14 minimum - bias au@xmath15au collisions recorded with the phenix central arm spectrometers during the 2007 and 2010 runs , respectively .",

    "the energy is determined with the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) .",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath22 are identified utilizing the ring - imaging erenkov detector by requiring a minimum of three phototubes associated with both charged tracks at the expected ring radius as well as requiring the respective energy / momentum ratios to be greater than 0.6 .",
    "we select photons that converted in the readout plane of the hbd that is located at a radius of @xmath24 and has a radiation length @xmath25 .",
    "our method to identify photon conversions uses only the phenix central arm detectors , with the hbd playing no active role .",
