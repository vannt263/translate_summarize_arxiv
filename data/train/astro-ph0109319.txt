    "a basic exercise in the design of any astronomical camera or observing program is the estimation of the expected uncertainties , typically in the form of the photometric @xmath0 ratio for a source of a given angular size in a given exposure time .",
    "calculation of the @xmath0 from aperture photometry is straightforward once the characteristics of the source , sky background , telescope , and detector have been ascertained .",
    "derivations of these calculations , and web - based forms to perform them , can be found , for example , in the online documentation for the _ hst _ and for noao telescopes .",
    "the common aperture - photometry formulae give a good rough estimate of the expected performance , but do not address several issues that are critical to optimizing a telescope design or observing - program design .",
    "the goal of this paper is to demonstrate a means to incorporate the following issues into an exposure - time analysis :    * aperture photometry is not optimal ; for unresolved sources , point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting techniques are optimal .",
    "what is the accuracy of psf - fitting photometry , especially for diffraction - limited point - spread functions ( psfs ) from obscured circular apertures ?",
    "* the aperture formulae assume pixels either much smaller than or much larger than the optical psf .",
    "the intermediate case is more common , and must be handled by creating an `` effective psf '' which includes the pixelization .",
    "* what are the errors for positional measurements on point sources ( astrometry ) , galaxy magnitudes / colors ( photometric redshifts ) , and galaxy ellipticities ( weak lensing ) under optimal analyses ? * how does undersampling or sub - pixel dithering affect accuracy ?",
    "* how do intrapixel sensitivity variations_e.g . _",
    "the `` picture frame '' effect typical of hgcdte detector pixels  affect these measurements ?",
    "likewise , what about charge diffusion within the detector ?",
    "* how does one quantitatively assess the impact of cosmic - ray hits without having to produce monte - carlo images ?",
    "* how does uncertainty in the source position affect photometric estimates ?",
    "the impetus for this work is to predict precisely the performance of various configurations of the proposed _ supernova acceleration probe _",
    "( _ snap _ ) satellite in its primary mission of supernova photometry , and its additional capabilities for weak lensing , photometric redshift , and astrometric surveys . in any astronomical camera design",
    "there is a trade - off in choosing an angular scale for the pixels : pixels small enough to finely sample the instrument resolution will prevent the degradation or aliasing of small - scale image information .",
    "larger pixels , however , ameliorate read noise and may allow a larger field of view ( fov ) in cases where detector pixels or bandwidth are scarce , or due to optics constraints .",
    "how severe is the penalty in photometric accuracy that one incurs from degraded sampling and resolution of larger pixels , and when does the loss outweigh the potential gains in fov ?",
    "such tradeoffs are apparent in the 01 pixel scale of the wfpc2 wide - field ccds . given the volume of data taken with wfpc2 , surprisingly few examinations of this tradeoff have been published .",
    "several recent publications in the astronomical literature have discussed aspects of the more general exposure - time issues delineated above :    * @xcite[l99a ] gives a good review of the mathematics of undersampled images , and presents a method for removing aliased signals given an arbitrary pattern of dithered exposures .",
    "i will follow the l99a conventions where possible .",
    "* @xcite[l99b ] continues with a discussion of point - source photometry in undersampled images , giving numerical results for the errors inherent in naive aperture photometry ( and centroiding ) on _ hst _ images . in this document",
    "i discuss extensively what l99b briefly mentions : that proper psf - fitting photometry can be much more accurate , both for flux and centroid , than simple aperture - summing .",
    "* @xcite give a lengthy discussion of the derivation of accurate astrometric information from wfpc2 .",
    "the psf - fitting techniques i use here would extract the same information from the images .",
    "* @xcite ( and references therein ) discuss the reconstruction of dithered undersampled images , particularly the drizzle algorithm , which is a robust spatial - domain technique . in this document",
    "i will be concerned not with image reconstruction , but with quantitative extraction of various image moments ( fluxes , centroids , and ellipticities ) , so i ll not make use of drizzle .",
    "* @xcite describe several kinds of psf figures of merit  including several given in this paper  with regard to the _ wfhri _ concept of an array of ground - based tip - tilt telescopes .",
    "further information may be found on the web pages for the _ wfhri _ and _ poi _ projects . * technical reports for space - based telescope projects",
    "have addressed some of these issues , primarily with simulated data , _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite investigate the undersampling issue for _",
    ", @xcite examine the maximum cosmic - ray load for _ ngst _ instruments , and @xcite use the _ ngst mission simulator _ to investigate optimal pixel sizes .",
    "all of the techniques used in this paper are familiar to the image - analysis community and many of the elements are discussed in the above and other references .",
    "but i have not found in the astronomical literature : an application of the fisher information matrix to point - source photometry in the presence of cosmic rays ; a quantitative discussion of the effects of pixel size on weak lensing measurements ; or a quantitative derivation of the required amount of dithering .",
    "more importantly , there is not to my knowledge a publication or software tool which combines all of these important effects to make detailed exposure - time estimates .",
    "that is the goal of this publication .    following this introduction is a general discussion of pixelization and sampling upon imaging observations , giving the analytical framework for the calculations .",
    "the next section briefly describes the implementation of these ideas in the etc++ software package . ",
    "[ results ] demonstrates the capabilities of the methods and software by providing quantitative answers to some general questions : what is the @xmath0 penalty for oversized pixels ?",
    "what amount of dithering is required to reach optimal @xmath0 ?",
    "then i address some more specific questions about optimizing camera configurations , and comparing the performance of state - of - the art space - based imaging vs ground - based imaging .",
    "following the l99a and l99b exposition : the scene being imaged has intrinsic intensity distribution @xmath1 , with fourier transform @xmath2 .",
    "the fourier transform convention is `` system 2 '' of @xcite : @xmath3 the telescope optics convolve the image with some optical point - spread function ( psf ) @xmath4 ( which i take to have unit integral ) . with the above convention for the fourier transform ,",
    "the convolution @xmath5 has transform @xmath6 .",
    "the pixelization of the image by the detector entails two operations : first , the optical image is convolved with the * pixel response function * ( prf ) @xmath7 ( which i normalize to unit integral ) , and sampled on the two - dimensional grid of pixel centers on spacing @xmath8 .",
    "the data from a single array readout are thus the image @xmath9       \\shah({x\\over a},{y \\over a})\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the 2d _ shah _ function , @xmath11 in the fourier domain , the pixelated , sampled image is @xmath12 \\ast a\\shah\\left ( { a k_x \\over 2\\pi } , { a k_y \\over 2\\pi}\\right ) \\\\   & = & \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^\\infty \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty      \\tilde o \\tilde p \\tilde r(k_x+m\\delta k , k_y+n\\delta k ) \\\\",
    "\\delta k & \\equiv & { 2\\pi \\over a}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the detected image , therefore , looks like the source image as convolved with an _ effective psf _ ( epsf ) @xmath13 , and sampled at interval @xmath8 .",
    "the sampling mixes power at spatial frequency @xmath14 down to frequency @xmath15 , leaving the nature of the original @xmath16 ambiguous .",
    "this _ aliasing _ is detrimental to our efforts , as we can not from a single measurement know exactly either the epsf ( from observing point - source stars ) or the intrinsic scene @xmath17 .",
    "an optical telescope can not transmit spatial frequencies beyond @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the largest dimension of the telescope aperture and @xmath20 is the wavelength .",
    "there is no aliasing if @xmath21 for @xmath22  meters , @xmath23 , this _ nyquist _ sampling corresponds to 005 pixels .",
    "when the data have been sampled at nyquist or higher density , we can produce shifted , rotated , or deconvolved versions of the image with no ambiguity ( apart from noise ) .",
    "in the _ snap _ mission , this will mean that subtraction of the host galaxy from supernova images will be essentially perfect , as long as the template image is nyquist - sampled .",
    "this holds for other time - domain signals , such as microlensing , planetary transits , and kuiper belt surveys . for weak lensing surveys ,",
    "it means that the systematic ellipticities imposed on galaxies by the psf can , in theory , be removed nearly perfectly .",
    "nyquist sampling is thus highly desirable .      by taking a series of exposures with pointings _ dithered _ by a fractional pixel amounts",
    ", we can sample the epsf - convolved scene more densely than the pixel grid .",
    "it is important to realize that the two effects of pixelization are in fact separable : the epsf depends on the size of the pixel through the prf @xmath7 ; but _ the sampling density can be denser than the pixel grid @xmath8_. if we choose dither positions on a grid @xmath24 , then we eliminate aliasing as long as @xmath25 .",
    "we can therefore obtain nyquist - sampled data even with large pixels . to first order",
    "this comes with no noise penalty : if we replace a single exposure of time @xmath26 with a dithered grid of @xmath27 exposures each of time @xmath28 , then the total counts from the source are the same ; the final image has the same number of sky photons per unit area ( fewer per sample , but more samples per unit area ) .",
    "there is , however , an increase in overhead and read noise from the extra exposures , and the data rate must be higher .    what is the optimal dither pattern ?",
    "l99a demonstrates that , for image reconstruction , a regularly interlaced grid offers the lowest noise .",
    "i have not encountered any reason to execute any other pattern .",
    "interlacing makes the analysis straightforward , and the l99a and drizzle techniques can be rendered equivalent in this case .",
    "given that interlacing can recover nyquist sampling , the remaining drawback to larger pixels is the poorer resolution in the epsf , which degrades the s / n for background - limited photometry and for centroid and ellipticity measurements of marginally resolved galaxies .",
    "i will quantify this below .",
    "there are two important differences between space - based and ground - based data  one obvious and one more subtle  that suggest that a spaced - based observatory is likely to make use of larger pixels ( relative to the psf fwhm ) than a ground - based imager :    1 .",
    "* dithering does not work easily for ground - based images .",
    "* this is because atmospheric seeing is constantly changing the psf .",
    "each successive exposure would be sampling a different psf , rendering the de - aliasing difficult or impossible .",
    "if the psf varies on spatial scales of @xmath29 , then there must be enough psf - template stars in each @xmath30 area to sample different pixel phases and solve for the unaliased psf .",
    "space observatories , however , can have exceptionally stable psfs , longer than the time required to complete a dither sequence .",
    "for _ hst _ , the psf varies significantly on the 90-minute orbit time due to thermal cycling .",
    "_ snap _ will rarely go into earth eclipse , and even the earthshine thermal load will vary only on the 15-day orbital period .",
    "* the `` dynamic range '' of a ground - based psf is larger than in space . *",
    "colloquially an image is considered `` nyquist - sampled '' if there are @xmath31 pixels across the fwhm of the psf . on large ( 8-meter ) ground - based telescopes in excellent seeing , this requires pixels @xmath32 , which is easily accommodated , in fact difficult to avoid given the plate scales of 8 m telescopes .",
    "in fact the psf can have structure all the way to @xmath33 , which is only 6  mas for @xmath34-band observations , so a formally complete sampling of the psf is not practical .",
    "the high-@xmath35 image power is strongly suppressed by the atmospheric seeing , however , so there is some sampling density at which the aliased power can be deemed insignificant .",
    "for a psf generated by kolmogorov turbulence ( @xmath36 $ ] ) , sampling at 2.5 pixels per fwhm limits the aliased fourier amplitude to about 1% of the total amplitude .",
    "this may not suffice for some applications , such as high - precision difference imaging , or weak - lensing surveys which need systematic ellipticity errors reduced to @xmath37 .",
    "cutting the aliased amplitudes down to 0.1% requires 3.1 samples per fwhm . +",
    "a diffraction - limited circular telescope , on the other hand , has a fwhm of @xmath38 and can have no structure shorter than @xmath39 . hence putting @xmath40 pixels ( or samples ) across the fwhm",
    "leaves _ no _ ambiguities .",
    "the strict cutoff of the airy psf at @xmath41 also means that space - borne observatories will be relatively insensitive to pixel response functions that depart from the ideal unit - square model .",
    "if the prf has structure at wavelengths @xmath42 the pixel spacing , it will be irrelevant , since the psf does not pass spatial frequencies much smaller than the fwhm , which will be close to the pixel size .",
    "similarly , subtle pixel - to - pixel variations in the prf will not matter if they occur at high spatial frequencies . in  [ results ] we will quantify the effect of a sharply bounded `` dead zone '' within each pixel , which can be taken as an extreme case of intrapixel variation .",
    "all space - based observations intended for use as image - differencing templates or weak - lensing measurements should be interlaced by a factor @xmath43 sufficient to reach nyquist sampling .",
    "it is _ not _ necessary to nyquist - sample exposure sequences intended solely for photometry of time - variable point sources , as investigated below .",
    "the most accurate method for point - source photometry is psf - fitting .",
    "the vector of unknown parameters @xmath44 ( fluence and position ) is varied to minimize deviations from a model psf .",
    "we minimize @xmath45 ^ 2 \\over { \\rm var}(i({\\bf x}_i ) ) } , \\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the measured fluence ( counts per readout ) at position @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the epsf .",
    "minimization of @xmath49 is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood of the observations under the assumption of gaussian noise statistics .",
    "the _ fisher information matrix _",
    "@xmath50 is defined as the second derivative of the ( log ) likelihood function with respect to the parameters . in our case",
    "this becomes @xmath51 it can be shown that the inverse of the fisher matrix is the best attainable covariance matrix for the unbiased parameter estimates ( if a best indeed exists ) @xcite .",
    "fisher matrices have been widely discussed and applied to cosmic background anisotropy measurements , for example by @xcite .",
    "if the centroid is known _ a priori _ , then the uncertainty in fluence is just @xmath52 . to calculate the fisher matrix , we need the epsf , the incident flux , and a noise model .",
    "the sum runs over all pixels in all exposures of a sequence .",
    "i will describe an observing sequence by the interlacing factor @xmath43 , and by the number @xmath53 of exposures taken at each of the @xmath27 dither positions . in _",
    "parlance , @xmath53 is the `` cr - split . ''",
    "ideally the noise is dominated by shot noise from the source and from a uniform sky background of @xmath54 counts per unit solid angle per readout . in this case @xmath55 in the limit of bright sources , the flux uncertainty reduces to @xmath56 , ( @xmath57 is total source counts ) , independent of the pixel or dithering configuration .    in the background - dominated limit",
    ", when we take the centroid as fixed , the flux uncertainty simplifies to @xmath58 ^ 2}.\\ ] ] if the image has been sampled at the nyquist density or higher , then we can apply parseval s theorem to obtain the simple form @xmath59 thus in the limit of faint , nyquist - sampled , unresolved sources , the @xmath0 for detection / photometry depends up the effective area @xmath60 of the psf , and we can easily see how the prf affects this .",
    "the @xmath35-space integral form is particularly convenient since the airy psf is bounded to @xmath61 , and no convolutions must be executed .",
    "@xcite , for example , derive and make use of this form .",
    "read noise and dark current produce white noise that can be subsumed into @xmath54 in the simple formula ( [ areasn ] ) . when the image is not nyquist sampled , it is easier to transform the epsf to @xmath62-space and use .",
    "the fisher matrix also allows us to evaluate the astrometric accuracy for point sources .",
    "this is not a primary goal for _ snap _ , but i will present some results in  [ astrometry ] . in the background - limited case , the one - dimensional uncertainty of point - source astrometry",
    "is simply quantified as @xmath63 this and related forms are given by @xcite and used for analysis of the proposed _",
    "poi _ project .",
    "the incorporation of cosmic - ray ( cr ) hits into the fisher formalism is easy .",
    "we just remove from the sum ( [ fisher ] ) the information contributed by pixels that are ruined . in the _ snap _ mission , we expect the crs to span many pixels , while the epsf will be @xmath64 pixels across .",
    "hence the probability of losing the entire exposure s information is essentially equal to the probability @xmath65 of the central pixel being contaminated during an exposure . for detectors with non - destructive readout ( such as hgcdte arrays ) , being sampled continuously during the exposure , the information lost is only that fraction accumulated _ after _ the cr hit .",
    "there should be little difficulty identifying cosmic rays in space - borne images , as the vast majority of hits cover many pixels and deposit thousands of electrons .",
    "on the ground , cosmic rays cause negligible loss of information",
    ".      in the _ snap _ mission it will be important to derive accurate colors for resolved galaxies so as to obtain photometric redshift estimates for host galaxies .",
    "this places performance requirements on the @xmath0 of galaxy photometry . for a galaxy with known intrinsic flux distribution @xmath66 ,",
    "the best possible @xmath0 on the total flux is derivable through the same fisher information formalism as for point sources .",
    "this is equivalent to measuring the flux in a wiener - filtered image . in practice , however , galaxies come in an infinite variety of shapes , so one can not _ a priori _ choose the ideal filter for each image .",
    "more practical is to measure the flux through some predetermined aperture of shape @xmath67 : @xmath68 this weighted flux is not useful for studies requiring absolute total luminosities for galaxies , but will provide very accurate galaxy colors if matched apertures are used in different wavelength bands .",
    "i will assume , for simplicity , that both the galaxy and the weight are circularly symmetric .",
    "then a simple propagation of errors gives a @xmath0 ratio for the @xmath69 , when nyquist - sampled , of @xmath70 ^ 2}.\\ ] ] the first term in the numerator is the source shot noise , the second term is from the white - noise background arising from sky ( or dark , read ) counts of @xmath54 per unit area .    a useful choice of weight is the gaussian , @xmath71 .",
    "the fourier transform is of course also a gaussian , and can be evaluated for any candidate epsf @xmath48 and galaxy profile @xmath72 .",
    "the size of the weight function @xmath73 can be adjusted to optimize the @xmath0 for each galaxy on an image .    clearly",
    "the effect of finite resolution in the psf or prf is to remove high-@xmath35 information which might be present in the galaxy image .",
    "if the galaxy scale is larger than the psf , then the psf is irrelevant .",
    "small galaxies reduce to the point - source limit .",
    "below i evaluate the resultant @xmath0 for exponential - disk galaxies ( @xmath74 ) . in this case a gaussian - weighted flux measurement is only a few percent noisier than the optimally - weighted measurement .      for weak gravitational lensing measurements ,",
    "we wish to detect small shears to the intrinsic shapes of galaxies .",
    "a poorly resolved or noisy galaxy image will inhibit this .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that for a background - limited , nearly circular , nyquist - sampled galaxy with radial flux profile @xmath75 , the photon - noise contributions to the uncertainty in the ellipticity components @xmath76 and @xmath77 are each optimally @xmath78^{-1}.\\ ] ] this is again easily calculated if we assume an exponential @xmath75 and know our epsf . in weak - lensing measurements , this photon noise level must be reduced below the _ shape noise _ level of @xmath79 attributable to the intrinsic variation in galaxy ellipticities .",
    "non - circular galaxies will have slightly more photon noise than for a given magnitude and size , but this is a minor effect .",
    "a further limitation to weak lensing measurements is systematic contamination of the intrinsic shapes by uncorrected artifacts of asymmetric epsf s .",
    "as noted above , a nyquist - sampled space - telescope image provides complete information on the epsf , and hence will permit nearly - perfect suppression of these systematic errors .",
    "ground - based images must be sufficiently well - sampled to avoid aliasing any significant power .",
    "furthermore , as the psf is temporally and spatially variable in ground - based images , the mean spacing between bright psf - template stars must be less than the angular scale of psf variation .",
    "the space telescope has the luxury of constructing a psf map by combining template stars from a series of exposures .",
    "the above formulae have been implemented as a set of c++ classes and driver programs .",
    "this etc++ software is available from the author .",
    "the interesting elements of the code are described here .",
    "psfs or epsfs can be created as instances of the psf class .",
    "a psf can be an airy pattern , a gaussian , a square prf , a kolmogorov - turbulence seeing function , or an arbitrary convolution of any of these .",
    "any psf can return its value at some @xmath80 vector , or the real - space transform ; the point - source sensitivities @xmath60 and @xmath81 can be calculated ; or , given a galaxy specification , the photometric accuracy or ellipticity variance can be calculated .",
    "the galaxy base class describes a galaxy image .",
    "a galaxy has a flux and half - light radius .",
    "one can request the intensity of the galaxy at any point in @xmath62 or @xmath35 space , or the derivative @xmath82 required for .",
    "there are currently two options : galgaussian and galexp .",
    "the params class contains all the specifications of an observatory and observing scheme that are necessary to calculate the @xmath0 quantities : telescope aperture , obscuration , quantum efficiencies , filter specifications , detector characteristics , exposure times and sequences , cosmic - ray rates , etc .",
    "these are input from text files , and then can be parsed to produce the effective psf for the observation , the source and sky count rates , etc .      given an observing scheme , count rates , detector noise model , and epsf , the fishercalc class can produce the fisher information matrix using , then report the parameter errors .",
    "if cosmic rays are present , then there is a distribution of possible flux and centroid errors : this error distribution is calculated either by an exhaustive search of possible cosmic - ray outcomes , or by monte - carlo sampling of cosmic - ray outcomes .",
    "the uncertainty distribution can also include an integration over a grid of possible source positions relative to the pixel grid .",
    "there are top - level programs that make use of the above classes to return the photometric or astrometric @xmath0 of point sources for a given observing scheme .",
    "because the @xmath0 depends upon pixel phase ( for undersampled images ) and cosmic - ray outcomes , the @xmath0 levels are in fact reported as percentile values , _",
    "e.g. _ the median , 5th and 95th percentile flux errors .",
    "other top - level programs report the photometric and ellipticity measurement speeds for galaxies .",
    "more interesting is the optimize program , which seeks the observing scheme ( exposure times , interlacing and cr - split factors ) that reaches a desired @xmath0 on point sources in minimum total observing time .",
    "the target @xmath0 must be specified , as well as the `` confidence level '' giving the fraction of sources which must be measured to the target accuracy .",
    "this calculation is meant to be quite realistic , including all time overheads , cosmic rays , sampling , etc .",
    "this section demonstrates some applications of the above tools .",
    "some of the questions addressed here are very general , while some are specific to the _ snap _ optimization .",
    "if the pixels are larger than the nyquist size @xmath39 , what interlacing factor @xmath43 is required to recover most of the photometrically useful information ?",
    "estimation of the point - source flux via psf - fitting does not require nyquist sampling , as long as an unaliased psf template is available ; the loss of information from aliasing can be minor if the sampling is adequate .",
    "figure  [ choosen ] shows the recovered @xmath0 ratio for a diffraction - limited psf observed on perfect square pixels of some size @xmath83 , for various interlacing factors @xmath43 .",
    "the total observing time is held fixed , i ignore overheads and read noise , and assume here a background - limited observation .",
    "the heavy line shows the @xmath0 for nyquist - sampled images ( relative to infinitesimal pixels ) .",
    "the degradation of point - source @xmath0 as the prf broadens is apparent .",
    "the solid red line shows the median @xmath0 in the @xmath84 case , _",
    "i.e. _ no interlacing .",
    "there is up to 30% degradation when @xmath85 .",
    "the dashed red line shows the @xmath0 at the worst pixel phase .",
    "a little dithering helps a lot , however . for @xmath86 ( blue lines ) , both the rms and worst - case are very close to nyquist for @xmath87 . for @xmath88 ( blue lines ) , both rms and worst - case are within a few percent of nyquist at all pixel sizes .",
    "photometrically speaking , therefore , there is little point to interlacing at @xmath89 .",
    "the reason is that the prf itself rolls off sufficiently quickly that there is little aliasing for @xmath89 , regardless of the psf .",
    "many detectors do not have uniform response across the geometric pixel square . as a canonical example i consider a case where the pixel contains dead `` gutters '' at the outer 10% of each pixel edge , so the active area covers only 64% of the geometric pixel .",
    "for oversized pixels one might worry that the star could fall into the dead area .",
    "since the psf is not finite , there is always some flux in the sensitive areas . while naive aperture photometry will fail in this case",
    ", a psf fit will recover an unbiased flux estimate and centroid  but the loss of information could be significant , as intuition suggests .",
    "the second panel of figure  [ choosen ] shows the photometric @xmath0 vs pixel size in this case .",
    "non - interlaced exposures ( @xmath84 , red line ) are far worse than nyquist sampling for @xmath85 . interlacing with @xmath86 recovers the nyquist @xmath0 up to @xmath90 , however , and @xmath88 interlacing again recovers almost the full nyquist @xmath0 for any sensible pixel size .",
    "once the epsf is known from bright stars , the non - uniformity of the prf is immaterial .",
    "of course if each pixel has a different prf , then the template epsfs will be incorrect , leading to magnitude errors .",
    "but it is important to recall that only variations at spatial frequencies below @xmath91 can make any difference .",
    "unless the prf is grossly larger than the airy disk ( and the charge - diffusion scale ) , inter - pixel variations will be strongly damped in the epsf .",
    "i plot in figure  [ centrnyq ] the relative _ position _ accuracy for a pixellated airy psf as a function of pixel size and interlacing .",
    "the penalty for large pixels is more severe for astrometric observations than for photometry .",

    "for @xmath94 we see that @xmath88 interlacing recovers the nyquist accuracy in the median case , but an unfavorably positioned star can have greatly degraded astrometric accuracy .",
    "in contrast to the photometric measurement , an astrometric measurement of a bright star is degraded by large pixels .",
    "but the dependence of @xmath95 on @xmath96 is not as steep as in the faint ( background - limited ) case .    for point - source measurements , therefore , i find it is typically necessary to interlace exposures only to about half the nyquist density , though complications may arise for very large ( @xmath97 ) pixels",
    ". if a large number of exposures must be taken , however_e.g .",
    "_ to avoid saturation or cosmic - ray loading  one might as well interlace to the nyquist level .",
    "what choice of pixel scale allows a science goal to be achieved with the fewest resources ?",
    "the most typical scarce resource is total observing time @xmath26",
    ". there may be an additional constraint on the fov imposed by the optical design , in which case one typically tries to reduce the pixel scale @xmath96 until read noise is important or @xmath98 .",

    "@xmath60 is simply the pixel area @xmath105 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the common heuristic approximation @xmath106 will _ underestimate _ @xmath60 , and hence the required exposure time , by up to 40% between these limits . in particular , note that nyquist - sampling pixels ( @xmath107 ) degrade the airy @xmath60 level by 13% , while pixels at the airy fwhm of @xmath108 degrade the speed by about a factor 1.5 , assuming interlacing to the nyquist level .",
    "the degradation of point - source @xmath0 is more severe if the detector has significant diffusion of charge before collection into pixels .",
    "the dashed line in figure  [ asnfig ] shows @xmath60 when there is gaussian charge diffusion with @xmath73 of one - half pixel . in this case",
    "even the nyquist - sized pixels increase @xmath60 by 30% , and the @xmath60 for @xmath109 is @xmath110 pixels , three times worse than the pure airy value .    on the other hand",
    ", the overall speed of a photometry project can be an increasing function of pixel size if the number of pixels is constrained . if the science goals require surveying a fixed , large number of square degrees to a given depth , then the total time to complete the project scales as @xmath111 so for fixed pixel count @xmath99 , the figure of merit is @xmath112 , which we see from figure  [ asnfig ] is always increasing with @xmath96 , to an asymptotic value of unity .",
    "a grossly undersampled camera at @xmath113 conducts a point - source survey 10 times faster than a nyquist - sampled camera ! in the presence of charge diffusion ,",
    "the undersampled camera is still @xmath114 faster .    for sources brighter than the sky background ,",
    "the @xmath0 is independent of pixel size , hence the survey speed grows with the fov , or @xmath115 if @xmath99 is fixed  an even stronger advantage than the background - limited case .",
    "the gains of larger pixels are realized only as long as the fov increases linearly with pixel size . in reality",
    ", aberrations and engineering difficulties will place lower bounds on the focal length and upper bounds on the fov .",
    "but these results suggest a very strong motivation toward coarse pixels in space - based survey projects .",
    "coarse pixels can have other well - known practical advantages with respect to dark current , read noise , and telemetry rates .",
    "the above calculations assume psf - fitting on isolated point sources .",
    "this is wholly appropriate for time - domain projects ( supernova hunting , microlensing , moving objects ) in which a high - s / n template image can remove all but the ( rare ) variable objects from an image . for other projects , however ( crowded - field stellar photometry ) , the large pixels will impose a severe crowding penalty , and @xmath116 will be strongly preferred .",
    "a project for which morphological information is essential will of course suffer with coarse pixels as the high - frequency information is strongly attenuated when @xmath104 .",
    "such projects really require optimization of image reconstruction as discussed in l99a and @xcite .",
    "even time - domain projects will suffer significantly when the pixels become large enough that the shot noise from neighboring ( static ) objects begins to outstrip the ecliptic sky background in a typical pixel .",
    "this occurs when the pixel size is comparable to the typical spacing between objects that have surface brightness above that of the zodiacal light background . at high galactic latitudes ,",
    "stars are rare , and galaxies with surface brightness above 2324  mag  arcsec@xmath117 will be many arcseconds apart from each other . for nearby supernovae , the host galaxy s central surface brightness may exceed the zodiacal light , so we favor small pixels which do not blend the nucleus / center with the supernova .",
    "microlensing and stellar - variability surveys will typically point toward nearby galaxies with many bright individual stars , so very large pixels may increase the effective background level .    in summary , for survey - oriented projects",
    "there are very strong efficiency gains from @xmath118 if pixel count and/or telemetry bandwidth are limited .",
    "astrometric measurements place a higher premium on compact epsf than do flux measurements since the centroid is a higher moment ( first ) of the stellar image than is the flux ( zeroth ) . in figure  [ astrompix ]",
    "i plot the relative survey speed for a background - limited , nyquist - sampled astrometric measurement as a function of pixel size , again assuming a fixed @xmath99 . in this case",
    "there is a very well - defined optimum size of @xmath119 .",
    "unlike the flux - measurement case , there are no gains to larger pixels ; bright stars as well as background - limited stars will prefer intermediate pixel scales .",
    "the only reason to use nyquist - sampled pixels ( @xmath120 ) on an orbiting astrometric satellite would be if there is no fov gain from a coarser scale .",
    "the optimization for weak - lensing observations depends upon the size of the target galaxy .",
    "figure  [ lensfig ] shows the time required to reach @xmath121 for a background - limited galaxy as a function of the galaxy size @xmath122 at fixed galaxy magnitude .",
    "when the galaxy is large , the required time scales as @xmath123 since the galaxy is well - resolved , but is spread over more background .",
    "when the galaxy size @xmath122 is below the epsf size , the required time grows as a strong function @xmath124 because the ellipticity information is suppressed by the epsf .",
    "there is , hence , a significant penalty to making the pixel scale too coarse , even if the fov can be increased along with pixel size .",
    "this is quantified further in figure  [ lensfig ] , in which i plot the relative speed vs pixel size @xmath96 for lensing measurements .",
    "if @xmath125 is the time required to reach @xmath121 , then the survey speed is @xmath126 .",
    "the figure plots relative lensing survey speeds as a function of pixel size under the assumption of fixed @xmath99 . in this case @xmath127 , and the curves show the speed for exponential - disk galaxies with @xmath128 .",
    "the vast majority of observable galaxies fall within this range @xcite .",
    "the smallest and largest galaxies are very poorly observed with this @xmath129 regardless of pixel size . for the intermediate sizes",
    ", we see that the optimal pixel scales are @xmath130 . if @xmath99 is fixed , therefore , it is once again advisable to make the pixels @xmath131 in size_not _ at the nyquist size @xmath39 .      here",
    "i use the methods and software described above to compare the survey capabilities of two proposed observatories : _ snap _ would represent the state of the art in orbiting imaging observatories late in the decade , with a 1  deg@xmath132 ccd fov behind a 2-meter telescope . the _ large synoptic survey telescope _",

    "from the figure it is clear that _ lsst _ surveys large galaxies about 45 times faster than _ snap _ , due to the larger aperture and fov , if i assume fixed @xmath158 vs wavelength .",
    "in actuality most galaxies are redder than this , so the relative speed of _ lsst _ will be decreased by about @xmath159 ( if @xmath160  mag ) .    for galaxies smaller than 03 half - light radius , _ snap",
    "_ is faster because the ground - based seeing dilutes the signal and squelches the ellipticity signal .",
    "indeed the required exposure times rise very rapidly ( @xmath161 ) when galaxies are poorly resolved , so in fact an orbiting observatory is essentially required to extract lensing information the bulk of galaxies at @xmath162 . high - order adaptive optics are never likely to cover sufficient fov to make practical weak - lensing observations , but the wide - field tip - tilt - correction scheme of _ wfhri _ @xcite may allow ground - based weak - lensing observations of smaller galaxies .",
    "i hope to analyse the relative merits of the _ wfhri _ configuration in the near future ; my expectation ( and that of @xcite ) is that _ wfhri _ will be faster for @xmath163 observations but the low background of _ snap _ will win out in @xmath147 or @xmath145 .",
    "i have completely neglected _ systematic _ errors in correcting galaxy shapes for psf anisotropies .",
    "eliminating these errors will certainly be much more difficult in ground - based images , both _",
    "lsst _ and _ wfhri _ type , because the psf will have strong variation in both space and time .",
    "the density of point sources must be high enough to be able to track these variations to the desired accuracy .",
    "the tools presented herein , while not particularly original or clever , permit one to optimize hardware and observing - protocol designs while accounting for effects that are typically ignored in aperture - photometry exposure - time estimates",
    ". proper consideration of pixelization effects and cosmic - ray hits can easily change the expected @xmath0 levels by a factor of 2 , for example . with this machinery in hand ,",
    "i have addressed a few issues of general interest , such as quantifying the effects of `` oversized '' pixels on photometric , astrometric , and lensing measurements , and showing that interlacing exposures in a @xmath164 pattern will extract essentially all the useful information .",
    "the phase space of observations for which orbiting imagers are advantageous has been delineated as well .",
    "more importantly , the tools presented here are very general and flexible , and can be applied to a great variety of future design optimizations .",
