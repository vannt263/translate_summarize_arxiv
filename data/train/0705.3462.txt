    "following star formation throughout the universe s history is key to understanding how galaxies have evolved . a wide variety of methods have been used to probe galaxies and their star formation activity over the cosmic ages . at high redshifts ,",
    "most of the information at our disposal comes on the one hand from direct observations of star - forming galaxies over most of the electromagnetic spectrum  from x - ray to radio wavelengths  and , on the other , from indirect , but more precise , studies of the interstellar absorption lines produced by intervening galaxies in the spectra of background quasars ( qsos ) .",
    "these two techniques should be complementary , and yet it has proved difficult until recently to bring their respective results together into one comprehensive picture .",
    "the aim of this paper is to bridge this gap by presenting _",
    "direct _ imaging and spectroscopic observations of galaxies originally selected via their absorption characteristics .    the class of qso absorption - line systems ( qals ) which has been studied most extensively in this respect are the damped lyman-@xmath6 systems ( dlas ) , defined by neutral hydrogen column densities @xmath9 .",
    "at the upper of the column density distribution of qals , dlas should account for most of the neutral gas in the universe at @xmath10 and have thus long been regarded as the likely reservoirs of gas available for star formation @xcite .",
    "however , this potential for star formation is apparently yet to be realized by most galaxies identified as dlas .",
    "attempts to measure the star - formation rate of dla hosts  whether through direct imaging ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and spectroscopic detection ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , or through indirect arguments based on the inferred heating rate @xcite  have generally returned relatively modest values , lower than expected from a straightforward application of the schmidt law to their surface mass densities of .",
    "similarly , the metal content of most dlas is less than 1/10 solar at most redshifts @xcite , lower than that of the disk of the milky way over most of its past history @xcite .",
    "these characteristics are in stark contrast with those of galaxies detected directly through their starlight at similar redshifts in surveys such as those of @xcite .",
    "such ` lyman break ' , or more generally uv - bright , galaxies have star - formation rates @xmath11 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and have already reached near - solar metallicities at @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "if we are to reconcile these apparently contradictory results , it is essential to image the dla absorbers and measure the metallicities of their star - forming regions , for comparison with the values measured in the cold gas which evidently dominates the absorption cross - section .",
    "clearly , such efforts should focus first on dlas at @xmath13 , where both imaging and spectroscopy are easier to perform than at higher redshifts .",
    "once the connection between galaxies and dlas has been clarified at @xmath13 , it may be easier to interpret the data at higher redshifts .",
    "while there have been a few attempts in this general direction ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the body of relevant data is still very thin , mainly because surveys of dlas at @xmath14 require ultraviolet spectroscopy from space which is currently unavailable until the next servicing mission installs the cosmic origin spectrograph on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .    until then we have to rely on methods other than the direct detection of a damped lyman-@xmath6 absorption line to identify dlas at @xmath15 .",
    "we are greatly aided in such endeavours by the unprecedented statistical power of the _ sloan digital sky survey _ ( sdss ) . in a recent development",
    ", @xcite identified a sample of rare qals characterized by strong @xmath163934,3969 absorption .",
    "@xcite showed that caii systems selected to have a rest - frame equivalent width of the stronger member of the doublet @xmath17 are likely to have high values of @xmath18 ; they may well be a subclass of dlas ( * ? ? ? * henceforth ) .",
    "however , their connection to the ly@xmath6-selected dlas has yet to be fully clarified",
    ". also found that the @xmath19 strong  absorbers have higher average dust extinction than most dlas [ @xmath20 and average dust - to - metals ratio as high or higher than the milky way .",
    "their number density was also found to be @xmath212030 per cent that of the dla population at the same redshift . from recent @xmath22band imaging of strong  absorbers ,",
    "also at @xmath23 , @xcite find a mean impact parameter of @xmath24 with a filling factor of only @xmath2110 per cent for their sample .",
    "they also find that the luminosity dependence of the  absorber cross - section [ @xmath25 is stronger than the dependence established for strong  absorbers .    from the extensive body of work carried out on  absorption in the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) over the last 50 years , we do know that , locally at least , the  lines are seldom very strong because : ( i ) with an ionization potential close to , but lower than , that of  ( 11.9ev compared to 13.6ev ) ,  may not be the major ionization stage of ca in  regions where a significant fraction of ca may be doubly ionized ; and ( ii ) more importantly , ca is among the most depleted elements in the gaseous phase of the ism , being readily incorporated into dust grains ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it is conceivable that strong  absorption may preferentially arise in environments where some fraction of the grains has been destroyed  and the proportion of gaseous ca consequently enhanced by a large factor  by supernova - driven shocks associated with star - formation activity @xcite .",
    "partly to test this hypothesis , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth ) stacked the sdss spectra of qsos with strong  systems to search for emission from the absorbing galaxies .",
    "they found that the population as a whole exhibits only modest levels of in - situ star formation activity , with an average rate @xmath26 . in order to place this result in context , establish the nature of the strong  absorbers , and clarify their relationship ,",
    "if any , to the dla population , we have begun a programme of deep imaging and spectroscopy targeting initially the fields of sdss qsos with strong  absorption at @xmath27 . in this paper",
    "we report the first results of this survey for five fields : in each case we have detected galaxies at the redshift of the absorber and , unlike previous studies , we find them to be luminous , actively star - forming , and rich in metals and dust . while this may be partly due to the bias of our first observations in favour of easily recognized , and therefore luminous , galaxies , these initial results show that  absorbers should play an important role in improving our understanding of the general absorber population in the future .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : data ] we review our sample selection , describe the observations , which were conducted with the fors2 spectrograph on the very large telescope ( vlt ) of the european southern observatory , and discuss the subsequent data reduction steps .",

    "[ sec : caii_gen_results ] we describe the general properties of our -selected galaxies . in section [ sec : z_sfr_caii ] we deduce star formation rates and oxygen abundances using well established emission line diagnostics and compare them with analogous measures from the literature for the hosts of ly@xmath6-selected dlas .",
    "finally , sections [ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : conclusions ] present our discussion and conclusions , respectively .    throughout this paper",

    "in addition to describing the observations , data reduction and analysis , we pay particular note to the systematic effects involved in our analysis .",
    "this includes fitting the underlying stellar absorption along the balmer series and dust reddening corrections .",
    "absorbers were identified by searching for features with rest frame equivalent width , @xmath31 at @xmath32 significance in the sample of all 49409 sdss dr3 qsos with @xmath33 , classified by having ` specclass ' @xmath34 or @xmath35 in the sdss .",
    "it was also required that the @xmath36 line had a significance @xmath37 .",
    "detections were required to lie outside the @xmath38 forest and if two detections were separated by less than @xmath39 in redshift space they were classified as a single absorption system .",
    "absorber redshifts were measured using gaussian profile fits . for a candidate absorber to be confirmed as real it also had to show  absorption with @xmath40 significance at @xmath41 or , for @xmath42 ,  absorption at @xmath37 since the wavelengths of the  lines then lie outside the sdss spectral range .",
    "the sample was restricted to @xmath43 to allow the @xmath44 emission line to be observed in the optical and to allow easier identification of host galaxies from sdss imaging .",
    "finally , the sample spectra were visually inspected , to reject absorbers which did not look convincing .",
    "this left a sample of 40 absorbers . despite these checks",
    "there is a possibility that up to ten per cent of the absorbers in the sample could be spurious due to the difficulty of identifying the relatively weak  features , particularly at low-@xmath8 when stellar photospheric  h&k lines are often detected .",
    "photospheric  h&k detections can usually be eliminated by their very strong  equivalent widths combined with presence of other strong photospheric absorption features such as the ,  and  lines .",
    "however , some  absorption was subsequently found to be of stellar , rather than interstellar , origin from fors2 observations detailed in section [ sec : obs ] .",
    "these systems were removed from the sample and are not discussed in this paper .",
    "where possible , comparison between @xmath45 measured in sdss and , less contaminated , fors2 qso spectra offers another method of ensuring the interstellar origin of the absorber ( see table [ tab : sources ] ) .",
    "the sdss images were then examined by eye to identify likely host galaxies in each field .",
    "four sight lines , with particularly obvious choices for host galaxies were chosen for follow up spectroscopy . two of the targets already had sdss galaxy spectra , one observed through the qso fibre ( j0912@xmath465939 ) , the other observed through a separate fibre ( j1118@xmath470021 ) , but we wished to improve upon the s / n of the sdss data for the latter .",

    "the most important results from this work are the galaxy emission line metallicities and sfrs . before discussing these",
    "we briefly review what we have learnt about the general properties of our sample to set the context in which to consider the main results .",
    "the dominant property of the galaxies in our sample , with reference to the derived metallicities and sfrs , are their @xmath58 luminosities .",
    "it is likely this is a selection bias , which is highlighted by the fact that the lowest luminosity galaxy is one we did not identify through sdss imaging , but rather through its galaxy spectrum superimposed on the qso spectrum .    given their luminosities , one might expect these galaxies to have rotational speeds similar to the mw .",
    "the measured @xmath44 line widths of @xmath59 provide lower limits which are not inconsistent with this .",
    "however , given a random distribution of galaxy inclinations one might also expect some of these lower limits to be nearer the mw rotational speed if the @xmath44 emission is truly tracing galactic rotation .",
    "focusing on their velocity structures using with long - slit or integral field spectra would demonstrate whether this is the case or whether the @xmath44 emission traces other processes like outflows from the  regions .",
    "galaxy impact parameters in table  [ tab : galprop ] are similar to those of dlas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which is consistent with the  absorber population significantly overlapping with that of dlas .",
    "whilst this somewhat justifies our comparison between dla and  absorber sfrs , it is based on small number statistics .",
    "one might generally expect there to be a greater distribution of  absorber impact parameters ; dlas and other absorbers , such as those with strong , certainly have a broader impact parameter distribution .",
    "recent @xmath22band imaging of  absorbers by @xcite confirms this at high redshift , where they find mean impact parameters of @xmath24 .",
    "however , it is not obvious how our selection procedure would bias the data in this respect .",
    "the sed fits to the sample suggest that the -selected galaxies are normal star - forming spirals .",
    "since spirals should have relatively high gas cross - sections , it is not surprising that such galaxies are selected via their absorption properties .",
    "however , in general , direct imaging of low - redshift dlas reveals a mix of host galaxy types , including irregular , spiral and low - surface brightness galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is supported by a blind 21-cm emission study of local galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is unclear whether the predominance of spirals in our -selected sample is a consequence of the selection itself or our aforementioned luminosity bias .",
    "more detailed imaging and spectroscopic study of velocity structure of a larger sample is required to make more specific conclusions about the general properties of these -selected galaxies and to avoid the luminosity bias inherent in our current sample .",
    "nevertheless , some interesting conclusions can be drawn from the metallicities and sfrs measured in our galaxies .",
    "at least four out of the five galaxies studied are metal - rich , with solar or super - solar oxygen abundances ( table [ tab : caii_z ] ) .",
    "interestingly , similar values have been found in both cases where emission line abundances could be deduced in the host galaxies of known dlas at @xmath60 ( table [ tab : dla_sfrs ] ) .",
    "potentially , the oxygen abundance could be significantly super - solar in the galaxies where we estimate ( o / h)@xmath61(o / h)@xmath62 , because the strong - line indices at our disposal are poorly calibrated in the super - solar regime and the whole issue of how best to measure metallicities in nebulae with ( o / h ) @xmath63 ( o / h)@xmath62 remains controversial ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such high metallicities contrast with the generally sub - solar element abundances measured in most dlas from interstellar absorption lines . in the latest census by @xcite , the average ( column density weighted ) metallicity of confirmed dlas is @xmath64 at @xmath65 .",
    "there are several reasons which could explain such a dichotomy .",
    "one possibility is that such differences arise from the fact that different elements are being considered in the two sets of measurements . while emission line abundances measure ( o / h ) ,",
    "the interstellar determinations of @xmath66 are based on zn which behaves like a fe - peak element ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , in most dlas  and indeed in galactic stars  the @xmath6-element enhancement expected at metallicities [ fe / h]@xmath67 ( i.e.  1/7 solar ) is less than a factor of three .",
    "thus , this possibility is unlikely to explain fully the difference between our observations here and the typical dla absorption line abundances .",
    "a second option , which has already been mentioned , is the luminosity bias of our selection . as we favoured brighter galaxies in this initial study , we are also likely to have selected the more metal - rich galaxies within the presumably broad distribution of metallicities of dla hosts ( given the wide spread of values of [ zn / h ] measured in absorption ) .",
    "thirdly , it is conceivable that in some cases we may have misidentified the absorbing galaxy and that the host galaxy of the dla is a low luminosity dwarf below the detection limit of our images located close to the bright galaxy we have identified .",
    "galaxy clustering certainly makes this a possibility in some instances , although it is unlikely that we should be misled in every case .",
    "the prevalence of this scenario is being tested by searches for galaxies near faded gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and for dla galaxy hosts along sight - lines where high-@xmath8 lyman - limit systems block the qso flux from blue imaging bands @xcite .",
    "a fourth possibility , and potentially the most interesting to explore further , is that there may be systematic differences between emission- and absorption - based abundances if the two sets of data sample different regions within the galaxies .",
    "one could envisage a scenario where the nebular emission lines are stronger in the inner , higher surface brightness , regions , while the cross - section of the neutral gas producing the dla is larger in the outer parts . in the presence of radial abundance gradients ,",
    "a systematic offset of the sign and magnitude observed could result .",
    "this possibility has already been discussed by @xcite and @xcite and , while certainly plausible , its importance has yet to be quantified .",
    "what is required is a direct comparison of emission- and absorption - based abundances in the same galaxies and using elements which share the same stellar nucleosynthesis and degree of interstellar depletion .",
    "these requirements have so far been met in only one case , studied by @xcite , where no offset was found between nebular and dla abundances . however , the galaxy in question is a dwarf spiral where no abundance gradient was expected over the radial distance probed .    in this respect ,",
    "the sample of galaxies presented here , while still small , constitutes a prime set of targets for future ultraviolet observations once the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) in installed on a refurbished _ hst_. in particular , by measuring the abundance of sulphur ( an undepleted , @xmath6-capture element ) in the absorption systems , it will be possible to ( i ) obtain a quantitative estimate of radial abundance gradients in galaxies at earlier epochs  a parameter which is a fundamental importance in galactic chemical evolution models ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and ( ii ) clarify the reasons why @xmath66 remains sub - solar at all redshifts .",
    "recently , @xcite studied ` metal strong ' dlas ( msdlas ) , which are defined to have @xmath68 or @xmath69 , where the column densities are measured in @xmath70 . given the high metallicities of our -selected galaxies , it could be that the  absorber population overlaps more strongly with that of msdlas compared to that of dlas in general .",
    "studying the  and  line strengths in a sample of  absorbers would be interesting in this respect .",
    "this is already possible at absorption redshifts @xmath71 since the  and  transitions fall in the optical region .",
    "we have begun such a study with high resolution qso spectra from the vlt . clearly , for the redshifts studied here ( @xmath72 ) , uv spectra are required .",
    "the galaxies in our sample are actively star - forming .",
    "luminosity bias probably affects the measured sfrs more than the measured metallicities because the observed luminosity is , in part , caused by current star formation , while the high metallicities more strongly reflect past star formation .",
    "thus , although it is possible that most low-@xmath8 -selected galaxies could have near solar metallicities , it is unlikely they all have such high sfrs .",
    "we reiterate that the systematic effects discussed in section [ sec : systematics ] will have reduced the sfrs we measure and so all our sfrs are technically lower limits .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_oii ] that the dla - selected galaxies in the literature have similar  emission - line sfrs , before correcting for extinction , to our -selected galaxies .",
    "this is unsurprising , given that they were generally selected in a similar way to how we chose the  galaxy sample ( i.e.  relatively bright galaxies were found close to the qso sight - lines ) .",
    "however , what _ is _ surprising is that this suggests that the dla - selected galaxies should have similar _",
    "extinction corrected _ sfrs to our galaxies ( assuming the star formation regions in those galaxies have similar levels of dust extinction ) ; i.e.  the dla galaxies are also actively star - forming .",
    "the amount of star - formation associated with these dlas has therefore been underestimated in the literature .",
    "extinction corrections are important in star - forming regions , irrespective of the amount of dust associated with the absorber itself , which is generally very low ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; ) .",
    "previous authors have generally found much lower rates of star - formation associated with dlas ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is perhaps an indication that dlas , whilst not being the sites of _ in situ _ star - formation , are nonetheless closely associated with it .",
    "if one naively attempts to directly compare our sample s  sfrs to the higher redshift measurement of , who stack many  absorption spectra to measure an sfr based on , one concludes that our sfrs are too high to be applicable to the general -selected galaxy population .",
    "this is most likely due to differences between the impact parameter and luminosity distributions of the two samples .",
    "for example , two broad scenarios could plausibly explain the difference between the relatively unbiased results and our own :    1 .",
    "the relatively low  star - formation signal measured in could be dominated by @xmath73 galaxies at low impact parameters ( i.e.  inside the sdss fibre radius ) .",
    "these galaxies dominate the evolution in the madau diagram .",
    "that is , only some  absorbers in this scenario would be closely associated with the sites of star - formation . assuming this to be true",
    ", the following simple correction to the results allows a comparison with our more directly measured sfrs , thereby providing a crude estimate of the luminosity bias in our sample .",
    "firstly , at high redshift @xcite find that only thirty per cent of the excess galaxy luminosity associated with the  absorbers falls within the sdss fibres , thus the results must be altered to account for this .",
    "secondly , corrected their sfr measurement only for the very small dust extinction found in the absorbers themselves , not that appropriate to @xmath73 galaxies .",
    "for local galaxies , the average @xmath74 is @xmath75mag @xcite , corresponding to an extinction factor of @xmath76 at .",
    "thus , the sfr of @xmath77 translates to @xmath78 in this scenario .",
    "this is @xmath79 times the mean dust - corrected sfr in our sample ( @xmath80 ) . from the madau diagram @xcite",
    ", we expect a factor of @xmath81 drop in sfr density between the mean redshifts of the sample ( @xmath82 ) and ours ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "that is , our galaxy sample would appear to be @xmath84 times more star - forming than expected for -selected galaxies at low-@xmath8 .",
    "2 .   star - formation could be ubiquitous amongst  absorbers . in this case its signature would be dominated by low level _ in situ _ star - formation and the required reddening corrections would be low , i.e.  those used by .",
    "if this scenario were true then we have no basis on which to compare our low redshift results to this higher redshift one .",
    "however , our luminosity bias would be significant since our galaxy sample would represent highly unusual  galaxies .",
    "knowing  from the galaxy emission lines in the sample would help distinguish between these scenarios .",
    "unfortunately , their stacked  absorber spectrum has too low s / n to put meaningful constraints on  via @xmath85 and it is not clear that the @xmath85 limit from their stacked  dla sample applies equally to the  sample",
    ". nevertheless , the limits on  from their  sample favour scenario ( ii ) above . thus , while favour low levels of _ in situ _ star - formation associated with  absorbers and dlas , our work provides clear examples of highly star - forming  galaxies .",
    "it seems likely that some mix of these scenarios more closely reflects reality .",
    "indeed , @xcite find that their higher redshift  absorbers have a stronger galaxy luminosity  dependence on the absorber cross - section ( @xmath86 ) compared with that for other qals , such as  absorbers ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "a study of the sfrs in less luminous -selected galaxies will help to elucidate the situation ; we are currently undertaking such a study on the gemini telescope .",
    "we have presented the first direct study of -selected galaxies . the five galaxies in our sample are metal rich and actively star - forming .",
    "we have also demonstrated the importance of both stellar absorption along the balmer series and dust extinction in such galaxy studies .",
    "prior to this work , the literature contained emission - line fluxes of just seven dla - selected galaxies at @xmath88 from which sfrs could be derived . in only two of these galaxies was it possible to make the all - important dust corrections required for a robust interpretation of the observed sfrs .",
    "given the probable overlap between the  and dla populations , the current work represents a significant contribution to our fledgling understanding of low-@xmath8 dla - selected galaxies and the galaxy  absorber connection .",
    "it is likely that luminosity bias , introduced during our sample selection , is an important factor in the high metallicities and sfrs we observe . as such",
    ", it is unlikely that the sfrs presented here are applicable to all -selected galaxies .",
    "this is probably also true of the super - solar metallicities measured , though the slope and scatter in the luminosity ",
    "metallicity relationship ensures that the effect should be less pronounced .",
    "further observations of a larger , less biased sample of -selected galaxies is required to confirm this .",
    "a larger sample would also allow identification of general trends in -selected galaxy properties , such as the relationships between luminosity , sfr , metallicity , impact parameter , morphology etc",
    ".    it may be possible to estimate this luminosity bias by comparison with the results of who derived an -based sfr from stacked sdss spectra of higher - redshift absorbers .",
    "however , such a comparison is only possible if one assumes that s star - formation signal originates from some fraction of -selected galaxies with low impact parameters and @xmath73 luminosities . another plausible scenario ( and one favoured by ) is that most strong  absorbers host low levels of _ in situ _ star formation . in this case",
    ", the luminosity bias in our sample can not be determined but it clearly must be large since we do observe some highly star forming galaxies .",
    "future observations of a more representative -selected galaxy sample will focus on quantifying the relative importance of these scenarios .",
    "reddening corrections and proper treatment of the stellar absorption at @xmath85 and @xmath44 proved vital for a robust measurement of the sfrs in our -selected galaxies .",
    "if no dust extinction corrections were applied , our sfrs would be a factor of 20 smaller and would be consistent with the low sfrs reported in previous low-@xmath8 emission - line studies of dla host galaxies that did not apply a dust correction .",
    "it is therefore likely that previous conclusions about the apparently low sfrs in dla - selected galaxies should be revised .",
    "indeed , it is probable that the majority of such galaxies studied , via their emission - lines , to date are actively star - forming .    the observed slow increase in dla metallicity from high redshifts to the current epoch has raised concerns that dlas may not be reliable tracers of star formation in the universe . however , the fact that we find high emission - line metallicities and sfrs in -selected galaxies at low-@xmath8 is consistent with previous studies which conclude that dlas can be closely linked to star formation without themselves having high absorption - line metallicities .",
    "a study comparing absorption- and emission - line metallicities as a function of impact parameter would be an excellent way to assess this more directly ; it would constrain the relative contributions of dust and metallicity gradients to any observed discrepancies .",
    "a handful of individual dla galaxies have already been studied in emission and absorption @xcite , but a more complete sample of such galaxies is required for a comprehensive study . since  absorbers and their host galaxies are relatively easy to identify at @xmath89 , they will be the ideal targets for such a study when the community next has access to a space - borne uv spectrograph .",
    "those observations would also be vital for quantifying the ( likely strong ) overlap between the  and dla absorber populations .",

    "<S> we present new imaging and spectroscopic observations of the fields of five qsos with very strong intervening  absorption systems at redshifts @xmath0 selected from the sloan digital sky survey . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies of these very rare absorbers indicate that they may be related to damped lyman alpha systems ( dlas ) . in all five cases </S>",
    "<S> we identify a galaxy at the redshift of the  system with impact parameters up to @xmath1 . in four out of five cases </S>",
    "<S> the galaxies are luminous ( @xmath2 ) , metal - rich ( @xmath3 ) , massive ( velocity dispersion @xmath4 km  s@xmath5 ) spirals . </S>",
    "<S> their star formation rates , deduced from h@xmath6 emission , are high , in the range @xmath7 . in our analysis , we paid particular attention to correcting the observed emission line fluxes for stellar absorption and dust extinction . we show that these effects are important for a correct sfr estimate ; their neglect in previous low-@xmath8 studies of dla - selected galaxies has probably led to an underestimate of the star formation activity in at least some dla hosts . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible links between -selected galaxies and dlas and outline future observations which will help clarify the relationship between these different classes of qso absorbers .    </S>",
