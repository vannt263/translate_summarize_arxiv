    "we analysed archival observations of 2o  maser sources in the mcs taken in atca observations made on 2001 january 7 ( program c901 ) , and in the period of 2002 february2003 may ( c973 ) .",
    "table [ tab : setup ] summarises the observing strategy and correlator setup used for the observations . in each of the observing sessions",
    "all six 22-m antennas were used in the array , but for some observations only three baselines were useable .",
    "data reduction was undertaken using the _ miriad _ package , following the standard procedures for atca data .",
    "the visibility amplitude and phases were calibrated by referencing them to observations of flux density and phase calibrator sources .",
    "phase calibration solutions were obtained from the scans on the phase calibrators , j045005.4@xmath0810102 and j050644.0@xmath0610941 , one of which was observed every 1020 min .",
    "although there was a difference in the channel resolution for the correlator outputs in the different sessions , all data were smoothed to the achieve the same velocity resolution of @xmath10.5 .",
    "we then constructed synthesis images for each source to search for 2o  masers and to check the image fidelity .    for sources where",
    "a maser detection was confirmed and there was sufficient coverage of the uv - plane ( mainly in the c973 2003-june session ) , we attempted to obtain the spectrum and the coordinates of the maser emission from the image cube .",
    "even for the sources with sufficient uv - coverage , there existed significant side lobes , making the astrometry difficult .",
    "the angular resolution of the atca observations was typically @xmath10.5 ( corresponding to a linear resolution of @xmath10.1  pc at the distance of the lmc ) , within which most velocity components of a single maser source will be contained .",
    "because we are mainly interested in the number of independent maser sources rather than the internal structures of the individual maser sources in this paper , we have only determined the coordinates of the brightest velocity components of the maser sources .",
    "the uncertainty in the measured maser positions is 12  in the cases where we could not uniquely determine the brightest point of the maser source due to the high side lobe levels .",
    "columns 2 and 3 of table [ tab : lmc - h2o ] give the coordinates of the detected maser sources where we were able to determine them .",
    "a total of twelve 22-ghz 2o  masers were detected towards the lmc in the c901 and c973 atca observations , eight and one of which are newly discovered interstellar and circumstellar sources , respectively .",
    "table [ tab : lmc - h2o ] lists the sixteen interstellar 2o  masers in the lmc known to date ( see also the latest review of maser source surveys towards the mcs in @xcite ) . table [ tab : lmc - h2o - agb ] gives the parameters of the circumstellar maser newly detected .",
    "figure [ fig : spectra ] shows the atca cross - power spectra of the 2o  masers in the lmc .",
    "the stellar source o - agb 815 ( 2mass j05351409@xmath06743558 ) corresponds to an m4-type variable star ( hv 1001 ) with a @xmath2magnitude of 8.14 .",
    "its 2o  maser is apparently weak ( @xmath10.2  jy ) and the maser luminosity is comparable to or lower than that seen in supergiants in the mw ( e.g. , vy cma with an 2o  maser flux density of up to 1000  jy at a distance of 1.1  kpc , @xcite ) .",
    "the eight newly detected interstellar 2o  masers ( those where column 7 of table [ tab : lmc - h2o ] contains only the reference 4 ) are irasf04521@xmath06928 , hii 1107 , hii 1186 , n113a ( in n113/mc24 ) , iras  05202@xmath06655 , ngc  1984/oh  279.6@xmath032.6 , n214b and n180 . in some regions ,",
    "2o  maser sources were spread over an area of order 1 .",
    "taking into account the position uncertainty , we regarded maser emission located within a radius of 12  as a single source and they are shown in a single line in table [ tab : lmc - h2o ] .",
    "there are fifteen independent 2o  maser sources that are separated from each other by more than 1  ( 15  pc at the distance of the lmc ) .",
    "some bright 2o  maser sources were first detected more than 25 years ago ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , even for regions where there has been persistent maser emission over a long period , the sources have exhibited large flux density variability and sometimes drop below the detection threshold .",
    "for example , in the brightest maser source n113/mc24 , the peak velocity of the brightest maser component has dramatically changed and the strongest spectral feature observed in this paper ( observation in 2003 may ) was not detected in the observations of ebcqf10 ( 2008 august ) . as a result , apparent position shifts ( @xmath31  or @xmath30.25  pc ) may occur due to the maser sources with such flux variability in the different locations ( a christmas tree effect ) .",
    "clustering of 2o  maser sources on parsec scales is observed in some galactic star formation regions ( e.g. , w51 north and main ; w3(oh ) and w3  irs5 ) .",
    "therefore , the observed position shifts may be due to variation in the relative flux density between maser sources within a cluster , although we can not rule out the possibility that these shifts occur just due to the relative positional errors of the observations made at different epochs . n113/mc24 and n113a present one example of a cluster of 2o  maser sources ( @xcite ; ebcqf10 ) .",
    "we looked for corresponding objects within 10  of the maser sources and these are listed in column 9 of table [ tab : lmc - h2o ] .",
    "only the nearest sources from the maser position are listed .",
    "the corresponding 2mass sources are located within 3  of the masers .",
    "note that iras  05202@xmath06655 seems to be associated with an extended infrared source ( 2masx j05201653@xmath06652544 ) and its population is unclear .",
    "proximity to sources listed by @xcite may be a good indication of association with a yso .",
    "here we estimate possible detections of 2o  masers in the lmc using an 2o  maser luminosity function ( 2o - lf ) .",
    "@xcite derived the 2o - lf for the mw , which will be improved by further unbiased 2o  maser surveys in the mw ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "similar to the approach used by @xcite to estimate the expected number of 2o  masers in m31 , we need to rescale the 2o - lf using the relative star formation rates of the mw and the lmc ( @xmath14 and @xmath4 , respectively , @xcite ) .",
    "the shortest on - source integration time for the present data was @xmath13  min . with a velocity resolution of 0.5 , the corresponding detection limit for the peak of any 2o maser emission",
    "is estimated to be 1  jy . adopting a distance to the lmc of 51  kpc ( corresponding to a distance modulus of 18.55 , e.g. , @xcite )",
    "our detection limit corresponds to an isotropic 2o maser luminosity of @xmath5 .",
    "we calculate the expected number of 2o  masers with the luminosities higher than this value in the lmc to be @xmath115 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the actual number of the identified sources over 1  jy ( 16 sources in table  [ tab : lmc - h2o ] ) .",
    "this supports the argument that the number of 2o  maser detections in the lmc is consistent with mw expectations when the difference in the star formation rates between the lmc and the mw are taken into account ( @xcite ; ebcqf10 , and references therein ) .",
    "although the same approach when applied to m31 results in an underestimation of the expected number of detections ( prediction of @xmath13 compared to the 5 detected , @xcite ) , the difference is less than a factor of 2 and within the estimated uncertainty of this approach .",
    "ebcqf10 used the lmc yso catalogue of @xcite to investigate the infrared properties and spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of star formation regions with an associated 2o  maser and compared them to the entire sample .",
    "they showed that 2o - associated ysos have higher central mass , larger envelope radius , higher ambient density and higher total luminosity than the general yso population .",
    "ebcqf10 classified yso within 2of the 2o  maser position as being associated .",
    "applying the same criterion to the 8 new lmc 2o masers listed in table  [ tab : lmc - h2o ] , we find three ( hii 1186 , n214b & n180 ) have a definite yso each within 2  ( table 9 of @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , for the 16 lmc interstellar masers investigated by ebcqf10 , 11 were within 2  of a definite yso identified by @xcite .",
    "the cause of this discrepancy is not clear , it may indicate that the newly detected lmc 2o  maser sources are primarily associated with more evolved star formation regions than the sample of ebcqf10 , which targeted all the ch@xmath6oh , oh and 2o  masers known at that time .",
    "the three associations from the newly detected masers have similar sed properties to the maser - associated sources of ebcqf10 .",
    "however , none of them are sources identified by ebcqf10 as a high - probability maser candidate , so future searches towards these sources may provide additional 2o masers in the lmc .",
    "including the three circumstellar 2o  masers associated with red supergiants ( iras  04553@xmath06825 , 05280@xmath06910 , @xcite ; hv  1001 ) as members of the young stellar population , there are 19 independent maser sources in the lmc .",
    "even limited to 16 interstellar masers brighter than 0.5  jy , through measurement of the proper motions of these masers ( better than 100  @xmath7as  yr@xmath8 in a time baseline of one year ) it is possible to obtain 48 observables ( the three - dimensional velocity vector components for each source ) .",
    "a basic dynamical model of the lmc requires nine free parameters in the fitting : a source distance , a three - dimensional centre - of - mass space motion vector , the galactic rotation axis inclination and position angle and a third ( or higher order ) polynomial galactic rotation curve .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] shows that the 2o  masers are distributed throughout the lmc , mitigating the likelihood of bias in the model fitting which may occur if only a small number of independent locations were available .",
    "if the distance to the lmc and the axis of the galactic rotation are fixed in the model fitting ( using previous accurate determinations ) , it will be possible to extract the velocity field of the lmc and more precisely determine the centre - of - mass space motion of the lmc from maser proper motion observations .",
    "with the current sample of 2o  masers in lmc ( 19 in total ) and the existence of position - reference quasars within a few degrees of arc of these masers ( imai  in preparation ) , vlbi astrometric observations to estimate the centre - of - mass space motion vector for the lmc are feasible .",
    "they may provide an opportunity for independently checking the results of optical astrometry measurements . furthermore , measurement of the trigonometric parallax of the lmc ( @xmath9as ) may be possible . with a position measurement accuracy achieved by the state - of - the - art vlbi astrometry mentioned previously , an individual measurement of the parallax will yield only a marginal detection .",
    "however , with independent measurements from @xmath110 regions , each with potentially a few detections of the maser spot parallax , it will be possible to statistically improve the reliability and precision of the parallax detection .",
    "in the same observations it will also be possible to investigate the spatio - kinematical structure for each 2o  maser source and to study the physical properties of the star formation regions and the final stellar mass loss in the mcs .",
