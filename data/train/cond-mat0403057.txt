    "the density of states , corresponding to each spin branch , is equal to @xmath6 .",

    "( [ nonperturbed ] ) , the net density of states is still identically equal to @xmath4 .",
    "since the magnitude of the splitting , @xmath11 , at the fermi level @xmath12 is inversely proportional to the length of the spin rotation , this magnitude represents an important characteristics of the 2d structure , containing the electron gas .",
    "the importance of the spin - rotation length was appreciated since 1990 , when the proposal for device application of the spin - polarized currents was put forward@xcite .",
    "this proposal has lately attracted a lot of interest .",
    "if the magnitude of the so - splitting is large enough , it can be inferred from the beating pattern of the shubnikov - de haas oscillations , as was first demonstrated by dorozhkin and olshanetskii@xcite for @xmath13-based structures , and subsequently@xcite by luo _",
    "et al . _ for narrow - gap heterostructures",
    "while for large @xmath2 ( several _ mev _ ) , as in @xcite , the beats of the shubnikov - de haas oscillations yield a rather accurate value of so - splitting , extracting small splittings from the beating pattern is complicated in two regards : ( i ) very low magnetic fields ( with cyclotron energy smaller than @xmath2 ) and , correspondingly , very low temperatures are required to observe the beatings ; ( ii ) presence of even moderate disorder suppresses the shubnikov - de haas oscillations by the dingle factor , which gets large at low fields .    in the present paper",
    "we demonstrate that the disorder can , actually , _",
    "reveal _ the so - splitting even if @xmath2 is smaller than the single particle scattering rate , @xmath14 . in a disordered sample the local density of states ( ldos ) fluctuates randomly in space and these fluctuations contain information about so coupling .",
    "our main point is that this information , which is lost in the average ldos , is preserved in the correlation function of ldos at two different energies , @xmath15 .",
    "this function , whose magnitude is inversely proportional to the disorder , exhibits peaks at @xmath16 . even for @xmath17",
    "the peaks are well pronounced when the disorder is smooth , so that the transport relaxation time , @xmath18 , is much longer than @xmath19 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "smooth disorder implies that the momentum transfer in a single scattering act is small compared to the fermi momentum , @xmath20 . in this way",
    ", the states with energies @xmath21 and @xmath22 remain correlated after many , @xmath23 , scattering acts .",
    "therefore , the so - induced satellites in @xmath15 are sharp even in the presence of a strong disorder , @xmath24 , if the condition @xmath25 is met . in terms of underlying physics",
    ", the observation that a small so - splitting can be resolved in a smooth potential is quite analogous to the observation made in ref . concerning the manifestation of the landau levels in @xmath15 in the presence of a strong disorder , when the landau level structure in the average density of states is completely smeared out@xcite .",
    "let us emphasize , though , that in our case ( unlike ref . )",
    "the density of states in the absence of disorder is constant , which does not contain @xmath2 .",
    "thus , it is only in the presence of disorder that ldos becomes sensitive to the so splitting .    concerning the experimental consequences of so - induced satellites in @xmath15 , we note that the local density of states governs the probability of electron tunneling from the impurity in the barrier into the 2d gas@xcite .",
    "this fact was recently utilized in the resonant - tunneling spectroscopy@xcite of the ldos .",
    "more specifically , the correlator of the ldos determines the behavior of correlation function , @xmath26 , of the fluctuations of the tunneling conductance with the change , @xmath27 , of the source - drain bias . from the analysis of @xmath26 , measured experimentally ,",
    "the authors@xcite were able to extract the quantitative information about the structure of states and their inelastic lifetime in the disordered emitter . in the present paper",
    "we demonstrate that the so - induced correlations in the ldos give rise to the new characteristic features in @xmath26 .",
