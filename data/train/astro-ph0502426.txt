    "in the integrated spectra of old stellar systems , the strength of the balmer absorption lines reflects the luminosity - weighted effective temperature , which is dominated by the main sequence turn - off . in a simple ( i.e. single - age , single - metallicity ) system ,",
    "the turn - off luminosity and temperature are sensitive primarily to the age of the population . on this basis ,",
    "measurements of  and  line strengths have been widely used to constrain the ages of early - type galaxies both in clusters and in the field ( see thomas et al . 2004b , and many references therein ) . despite extensive work ,",
    "some fundamental questions remain unresolved , such as the influence of age variations in driving the `` red sequence '' of cluster ellipticals ( e.g. caldwell 2003 ; thomas et al .",
    "2004b ; nelan et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the interpretation of the balmer lines suffers from at least three complications .",
    "first , horizontal branch morphology is not included in most stellar population models ; if blue horizontal branch stars are present , they enhance the balmer lines and mimic the effect of younger ages ( maraston & thomas 2000 ; thomas et al . 2004b ) .",
    "second , the indices are measured on low effective - resolution spectra ( usually limited by the internal velocity dispersion of the galaxy itself ) .",
    "this causes the balmer absorption and neighbouring continua to be blended with a forest of nearby metal absorption lines .",
    "thus rather than true equivalent widths , one measures `` indices '' ( such as those of the lick system , see burstein et al . 1984 ) , which have residual sensitivity to metallicity and abundance ratios .",
    "third , many early - type galaxies exhibit weak nebular emission which `` fills in '' the stellar absorption , leading to over - estimates of the population ages ( e.g. gonzlez 1993 ) . the contamination is reduced for the higher - order lines ,  and , as a result of the typical line ratios for nebular emission .",
    "unfortunately , however , the usual index definitions for these lines are highly contaminated by metal - line blanketing , and depend more strongly on the overall metallicity ( worthey & ottoviani 1997 ; but see vazdekis & arimoto 1999 ) . moreover , they are sensitive to the enhancement of @xmath7-elements , as shown by thomas , maraston & korn ( 2004a ) . by contrast , the low - order line ,  is a less ambiguous tracer of age , if the nebular emission problem can be overcome .    in this paper , we explore whether these trends extend to the lowest - order balmer line , . in section  [ sec : popsynth ] , we review two index definitions ,  and , introduced by nelan et al .",

    "nelan et al . commented on an apparent steepening of the relation for low - mass systems , which could account for some of the disagreement with thomas et al . , and comparable studies .",
    "moreover , there are indications that nfps galaxies with stronger disks show a steeper age ",
    "mass relation than pure ellipticals or bulge - dominated s0s .",
    "both effects act in the sense which could explain the discrepancy between nfps and thomas et al . finally , the nfps colour  magnitude selection excludes any massive ` blue ellipticals ' .",
    "if included , and if present in sufficient numbers , such objects would tend to flatten the age ",
    "mass relation .",

    "mass slope of age@xmath38 ( see their figure 21 and table 9 ) , in agreement with nelan et al . and with our  results .",
    "again , this seems argue for a dependence on the mass - range , with giant ellipticals favouring a flatter age  mass relation , and low-@xmath13 objects yielding a steeper slope .",
    "as already hinted at , the above discussion neglects an important source of error , arising from uncertainties in the population synthesis model itself .",
    "these errors can be included in the constraints by propagating the bootstrap - response distribution of figure  [ fig : bootresp ] .",
    "recall that each bootstrap - realisation of the input stellar library was used to determine a new estimate of the parameter responses .",
    "most of the bootstrap realisations yield responses close to the `` best '' values , and hence yield ( @xmath19)-constraints similar to the picture described in the previous section . on the other hand ,",
    "some bootstrap points show strong [ fe / h ] responses ( e.g. around -0.5  in  per dex fe / h ) .",
    "these clearly improve the chances of observing a strong @xmath2 trend with neither a strong age - trend nor an excessive [ fe / h]@xmath2 scaling .",
    "finally , the spray of `` anomalous '' bootstrap results , due to realisations which lack cool dwarfs , assigns some ( low ) probability to quite unexpected ( @xmath19 ) pairs .    , the likelihood of the observed  gradient , given scaling relations age@xmath39 and fe / h@xmath40 .",
    "in addition to the observational errors on the @xmath2 slope , the likelihood explicitly accounts for synthesis model errors , using the bootstrap simulations .",
    "bold contours show the resulting 1@xmath13 , 2@xmath13 and 3@xmath13 confidence regions for two parameters",
    ". for comparison , dashed contours show the equivalent limits if model errors are neglected .",
    "the labels ` n ' and ` t ' refer to the scaling relations from nelan et al .",

    "as expected , the range of viable scaling relations is considerably expanded when the model errors are included .",
    "formally , for a constant - metallicity sequence , we obtain age@xmath42 from . in the constant - age case , the fe / h@xmath2 relation has a slope of @xmath43 at 1@xmath13 ( @xmath44 at 2@xmath13 ) , with no meaningful upper limits .",
    "thus if a constant age is imposed , the implied metallicity trend remains much steeper than values favoured by lick - index studies .",
    "allowing both parameters to vary , the nelan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) scalings lie at the @xmath45 contour .",
    "the scalings of thomas et al .",
    "( 2004b ) remain disfavoured at the @xmath93@xmath13 level .",
    "two curious aspects of figure  [ fig : bootscal ] are worthy of brief comment .",
    "first , the change in shape of the likelihood contours , which now form a closed curve at 1@xmath13 suggests that allowing for the bootstrap errors has actually tightened the constraint on the metallicity - gradient taken separately .",
    "however , if we integrate over the age - gradient as a nuisance parameter , to obtain the one - parameter constraint , the vertical `` flaring '' of the likelihood function compensates for this effect .",
    "second , because the likelihoods were derived from only 1000 bootstrap realisations , the 3@xmath13 contour is not well - determined .",
    "the noisy features at the lower - left of the  panel result from the anomalous bootstrap solutions , i.e. from the upper right of figure  [ fig : bootresp ] .",
    "the 3@xmath13 contour is retained in the plot mainly to show this effect , and to illustrate the discrete tracks which contribute to @xmath41 .",
    "the greatest obstacle to the use of  absorption as a stellar age indicator is its potential for contamination by nebular emission , both at  itself , and in the neighbouring [ nii ] lines . in section  [ sec : obsdat ] , we used the emission measurements at  and [ oiii ] to reject the objects most strongly affected .",
    "this approach lacks precision for very low - level contamination , since the  emission is weaker than . moreover , the  measurements are themselves made in the presence of imperfectly - known stellar absorption , potentially leading to underestimated equivalent widths .    as a result ,",
    "our `` low - emission '' subsample will include some galaxies with low - level contamination .",
    "in general , weak emission will yield smaller values for , causing galaxies to appear older . in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : data ] ,",
    "the scatter of outliers below the mean @xmath2 relation suggests such an effect , with a few galaxies showing negative  values , i.e. net emission . for",
    "the situation is more complicated , since [ nii ] in the red continuum region leads to increased index values , which may explain the absence of such dramatic outliers in the @xmath2 relation .",
    "this compensating influence depends on the ratio of [ nii ] to  emission , which is strongly correlated with absolute magnitude ( phillips et al .",
    "most of the outliers in  are fairly high mass objects , where the [ nii ] compensation will be most efficient . in this case",
    "however , it is surprising that they are not detected at [ oiii ] which should also be strong in such objects .",
    "although clipping of deviant points can remove a small number of outliers , a more serious concern is whether the mean relation itself might be driven by variations in emission characteristics , rather than age or metallicity .",
    "one test for this is to repeat the fits , allowing for terms in  and [ oiii ] emission , as well as velocity dispersion . in these",
    "fits the @xmath2 and @xmath2 slopes are very little changed , and the emission - line coefficients are not significant . to generate",
    "the observed @xmath2 trends with emission variations would require increasing  emission with increasing mass ( opposite to the behaviour at ) .",
    "the similarity of results from  and  is also difficult to explain if the @xmath2 slopes are mainly due to emission : because the two indices respond differently to [ nii ] , we would need either very low [ nii]/  ratio throughout , or else very little variation in this ratio as a function of mass . either option is contrary to the behaviour observed in galaxies with strong emission ( phillips et al .",
    "moreover , the amount of emission would have to be very precisely determined at any given mass , in order to retain a tight @xmath2 relation at all .",
    "a related concern is whether the -based selection itself biases the sample against low - mass weak - absorption objects .",
    "this is conceivable , since separating emission and absorption components of  is more difficult at low-@xmath13 ( nelan et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the signature of such a bias would be an increased proportion of emission - rejected galaxies below the fit , at small @xmath13 .",
    "the effect is not readily apparent in figure  [ fig : data ] .",
    "running the fits with a variety of alternative emission rejection schemes , including that of nelan et al .",
    ", the  gradients are stable at the 15% level . for , the results are less stable , yielding steeper slopes when the looser selection criteria are used .",
    "finally , emission does not easily account for the absolute age discrepancy between  and .",
    "recall that  yields older ages at given @xmath13 than .",
    "the emission effect should cause both indices to yield older ages , but  should be less strongly affected , as a result of the [ nii ] compensation .    in conclusion ,",
    "emission contamination remains a very serious concern for  absorption studies .",
    "emission undoubtedly generates outliers from the observed relations , some of which can not easily be excluded using other observations . on balance",
    "however , it appears unlikely that emission variations are responsible for the strong , decreasing trends of  and  with velocity dispersion .      as well as sensitivity to nebular emission , our result is subject to a number of other caveats , relating to assumptions and limitations of the synthesis model .",
    "the following paragraphs consider three such concerns : blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars , non - solar abundance ratios and imf slope variation .",
    "the balmer lines measure the luminosity - weighted temperature of a stellar population , so the  trend could be generated by any hot stellar component which becomes stronger at low @xmath13 .",
    "maraston & thomas ( 2000 ) and thomas et al .",
    "( 2004b ) have explored models with bhb populations , and shown that the strong  absorption of some ellipticals might indeed arise from bhb stars rather than from younger ages . because these stars have blue continua , they contribute more strongly to the higher - order lines than to  ( schiavon et al .",
    "2004 ) , and their impact will be weakened further at .",
    "quantitative modelling of the relative responses should offer one approach to constraining the importance of bhb stars in old populations .",
    "we have argued that non - solar abundance ratios are unlikely to have a strong effect on , since there are no strong metallic features within the band - passes used by our indices",
    ". the only feature of concern is the cai 6573  line , which affects the  and  indices in opposite senses .",
    "the similarity of the scaling relation slopes obtained from the two indices suggests that variations of ca abundance with @xmath13 do not strongly influence the results . on the other hand , the difference in absolute ages implied by the two indices could be related to this line",
    ". in particular , if ca is under - abundant for the whole sample ( relative to stelib ) , then  will be anomalously low ( leading to older ages ) , while  will be larger ( yielding younger ages ) .",
    "thus the sense of the effect is as observed . however , to force  and  to give consistent ages at given @xmath13 , we need a large metallicity difference , of @xmath460.3dex . on balance , simple differences in flux - calibration or resolution - matching seem more likely explanations for the 0.1  offset required to resolve the absolute age inconsistency .    finally , we have explored the effects of changing the assumed imf slope in the synthesis . for power - law exponents in the range 1.03.5 ( cf .",
    "default 2.35 ) , the predictions for  and  vary by @xmath470.3 . thus the full range of @xmath90.75  can not be generated by plausible levels of variation in the imf slope .",
    "having reviewed some of the potential systematic effects , in this section we consider whether a steep age  mass relation is compatible with other constraints , focusing on observations of cluster galaxies at lookback times of a few gyr . in what follows , we will adopt the -derived relation of age@xmath48 , which assumes no metallicity variations . considering that lick index studies suggest a mix of age and metallicity effects",
    ", this slope should be regarded as an upper limit .    since the absolute ages implied by the  synthesis are unacceptably old , we fix the age zero - point by forcing the most massive galaxies to the age of the universe .",
    "( note that if  were used instead , this rescaling would not be necessary , and all other results would be essentially unchanged . ) in this section we adopt the wmap cosmological parameters , @xmath49 ( bennet et al .",

    "`` formation redshift '' is to be understood as a luminosity - weighted mean age for the stars and does not imply the galaxy assembly time . at times earlier than this `` age '' , the galaxy may have been present in the cluster but with the bluer colours indicative of a star - forming system .",
    "the steep @xmath2 trend then appears to favour a picture in which galaxies now at the faint end of the red sequence ceased forming stars only at modest redshifts , @xmath51 .",
    "a testable implication is that the red sequence in high redshift clusters should be deficient in faint galaxies , with the depletion mass increasing with increasing redshift .",

    "however , there is very suggestive agreement with our  results , both in terms of the absolute age of the faint red sequence galaxies , and in the trend for fainter objects joining the red sequence at lower redshifts .",
    "additional support comes from the rapidly - evolving characteristic mass scale of e+a ( or post - starburst ) galaxies , as determined by tran et al .",

    "again , there is a suggestive level of agreement with our  results : the slope of the e+a mass evolution itself suggests age@xmath60 , slightly steeper than our result .",
    "the e+a `` ages '' fall @xmath91gyr younger than our relation would predict .",
    "qualitatively this is expected , since the e+a phase signals the last star - formation episode , while our relation describes the mean stellar age , which is necessarily older .    in conclusion , local galaxy studies which suggest rapid recent evolution in the red sequence population ( caldwell et al .",
