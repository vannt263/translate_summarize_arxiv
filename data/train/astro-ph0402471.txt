    "several indirect methods have been devised to estimate smbh masses .",
    "one set of these methods assumes that the broad emission - line region ( blr ) is in gravitational equilibrium with the central source , so that the smbh mass can be estimated by applying the virial theorem , @xmath3 , to the measured line widths ( peterson 1993 ; peterson 1997 ; wandel et al .",

    "these reverberation mapping studies have demonstrated an observed relation of @xmath5(5100  )@xmath6 that can be used to estimate @xmath7 for agns over a wide range of redshifts ( kaspi et al .",

    "netzer ( 2003 ) has argued that the slope is not known to an accuracy better than about 0.15 .",
    "a second set of methods is based on the tight correlation between the masses of smbhs and the velocity dispersions , @xmath8 , of their host galaxy spheroidal components ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",

    "early studies showed a large scatter , as much as two orders of magnitude between smbh mass and @xmath10 ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "however , more recent studies that carefully model the bulge light profiles of disk galaxies and thus obtain more accurate values of @xmath10 show less scatter in @xmath11 , similar to that in the @xmath12 relationship ( mclure & dunlop 2002 ; erwin et al .",
    "2002 ; bettoni et al .",

    "it is difficult to compare our results directly to shemmer & netzer ( 2002 ) because they measure only / and / ratios for a sample of individual objects .",
    "however , it does appear that the metallicity enhancement we derive as an average from several line ratios is smaller than the shemmer & netzer result based only on / and /.",
    "there is evidence supporting super - eddington accretion rates for @xmath3727% of the objects shown in figures 1 and 4 .",
    "previous studies have also found quasars that appear to be accreting at super - eddington rates ( e.g. , collin et al .",
    "2002 , vestergaard 2004 ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that changing the index on the @xmath88 relationship ( see  1 ) from 0.7 to 0.5 ( e.g. netzer & laor 1993 ; shields et al .",
    "2003 ) would actually increase our estimates of @xmath0 , by as much as a factor of @xmath37 4 in the brightest quasars ( see also netzer 2003 ) .",
    "super - eddington accretion can be explained simply by non - spherically symmetric accretion ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that accretion disks with radiation - driven inhomogeneities could produce luminosities up to 100 times eddington ( begelman 2002 ; wang 2003 ) .",
    "woo & urry ( 2002 ) find that only 9%  of their objects ( 21 out of 234 , see their fig .",
    "7 ) have @xmath2 .",
    "however , this may be due to the selection effect that their sample contains only 9 objects with @xmath89 ergs s@xmath14 . in our sample ,",
    "only 13%  of the objects with @xmath90 ergs s@xmath14 have @xmath2 ( compared to 8% , 18 out of 225 , in woo & urry 2002 ) , but 41%  of the objects in our sample with @xmath89 ergs s@xmath14 have super - eddington ratios .",
    "the nls1 composite spectrum exhibits many properties unlike the @xmath0 composite spectra .",
    "the nls1 composite has a much steeper (  softer \" ) uv continuum than the @xmath0 composites , consistent with studies finding that nls1s generally have redder uv continua than typical agns ( e.g. , crenshaw et al .",
    "2002 ; constantin & shields 2003 ) .",
    "there is no apparent trend between continuum shape and @xmath0 ( table 1 ) , but there are trends between continuum shape and both smbh mass ( see table 1 ; warner et al . 2003 ) and luminosity ( table 1 ; m. dietrich , private comm . ) , such that objects with lower smbh masses and lower luminosities have steeper (  softer \" ) uv continua .",
    "therefore , the steeper uv continuum in the nls1 composite may be due to the nls1 composite having a much lower average @xmath15 and @xmath29 than the @xmath0 composites .    interestingly , figure 2 shows that the nls1 composite spectrum most strongly resembles the composite spectrum created from objects with @xmath80 .",
    "it seems to fit at the top of figure 2 and not where it would be placed based on its average @xmath0 of 0.67 .",
    "based on this similarity between nls1s and quasars with high @xmath0 , it has been suggested that high - redshift ( @xmath20 ) , high - luminosity , narrow - lined quasars are analogs of nls1s ( mathur 2000 ) . however , despite the similarity in figure 2 between the nls1 composite and the @xmath80 composite , the rews of some emission lines in the two spectra can be quite different ( see figure 7 , constantin & shields 2002 ) .",
    "moreover , the nls1s do not fit the general trends in figure 7 between emission line rew and @xmath0 .    if host galaxy mass , which correlates strongly with smbh mass ( see  1 ) , is the fundamental parameter affecting blr metallicity , it is reasonable to expect no trend between metallicity and @xmath0 because there is no trend between @xmath0 and smbh mass in the @xmath0 composites .",
    "the results in figures 10 and 11 confirm this expectation .",
    "the different @xmath0 composites have similar average smbh masses ( table 1 ) and similar metallicities .",
    "however , the nls1 behavior is surprising .",
    "they have roughly the same metallicity as the @xmath0 composites even though their average smbh mass and luminosity are almost two orders of magnitude lower .",
    "figure 11 shows more directly that the nls1s have slightly high metallicities for their luminosities and smbh masses ( see also shemmer & netzer 2002 ; shemmer et al .",
    "if host galaxy mass , correlated with @xmath15 , is the main driver behind agn metallicities ( figure 11 and warner et al .",
    "2003 ) , then clearly some other factor is enhancing the metallicities in nls1s .",
    "the magnitude of the nls1 enhancement is modest , roughly 30%40% .",
    "note , in particular , that the nls1 metallicities are still well below the values derived for most luminous ( e.g. , high - redshift ) quasars .",
    "shemmer & netzer ( 2002 ) suggest that high @xmath0 is driving the high metallicities in nls1s .",
    "however , we have shown that there is no correlation between metallicity and @xmath0 ( figures 10 and 11 ) .",
    "in addition , luminous narrow - lined quasars with the highest values of @xmath0 ( such as br2248 - 1242 , warner et al .",
    "2002 ) do _ not _ have high metallicities for their smbh masses .",
    "we conclude that the additional parameter affecting nls1 metallicities is not related to @xmath0 .",
    "constantin & shields ( 2003 ) suggest that the result for nls1s having lower metallicities than high - redshift quasars runs counter to the hypothesis that these two groups of objects are in a similar early evolutionary phase .",
    "however , because the high - redshift quasars have higher smbh masses and luminosities than nls1s , they would naturally be expected to have higher metallicities .",
    "if both types of objects are in similar early evolutionary phases , and/or reside in young or rejuvenated host galaxies and the metallicities of both types of objects are thus enhanced by a similar amount , then the high - redshift quasars would still exhibit a higher metallicity than the nls1s due to their higher smbh masses .",
    "thus , we conclude that more information is necessary to determine if either nls1s or the high - redshift quasars ( or both ) are preferentially young objects .",
    "we have examined a large sample of 578 agns that spans five orders of magnitude in smbh mass , seven orders of magnitude in luminosity , and a redshift range from @xmath1 .",
    "we estimate smbh masses using the virial theorem and formulae given in kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and then derive eddington ratios . to improve the signal - to - noise ratio and average over object - to - object variations , we calculate composite spectra for different ranges in @xmath0 .",
    "we include a composite spectrum of a sample of 26 nls1s for comparative analysis .",
    "our main results are as follows .",
    "\\1 ) we find that a large fraction ( 27% ) of the objects in our sample have @xmath2 .",
    "these super - eddington ratios may be explained by non - spherically symmetric accretion .",
    "while nls1s generally show high eddington ratios for their luminosities , the objects with the highest @xmath0 are high - luminosity , narrow - lined quasars .",
    "\\2 ) there is no trend between @xmath0 and either redshift or smbh mass .",
    "@xmath0 does correlate positively with luminosity and negatively with fwhm ( ) , but these trends may be attributed largely to our derivation of @xmath0 from these quantities ( see equation 4 ) .",
    "\\3 ) there is no trend between the shape of the uv continuum and @xmath0 .",
    "the nls1 composite has a much steeper ( softer ) continuum than the @xmath0 composites .",
    "this is consistent with a trend between continuum shape and smbh mass .",
    "\\4 ) the composite spectra sorted by @xmath0 exhibit an unusual emission - line behavior : nearly constant peak heights and decreasing fwhms with increasing @xmath0 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the origins of this behavior are not understood , but it is in marked contrast to the emission - line behaviors in composite spectra sorted by luminosity , smbh mass , and fwhm ( ) ( figure 8) , all of which clearly show trends in the line rews analagous to the baldwin effect .",
    "\\5 ) the composite spectra show no trend between @xmath0 and metallicity ( figure 10 ) .",
    "this is consistent with smbh mass being related to the fundamental parameter affecting blr metallicity ( warner et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "\\6 ) the nls1 composite exhibits several unusual behaviors .",
    "it generally does not fit the trends between emission line rews and @xmath0 as defined by the @xmath0 composites .",
    "it also has a metallicity that is slightly high for its average smbh mass and luminosity , although still well below the high metallicities exhibited by the most luminous quasars with the most massive central smbhs .",
    "the quasars with the highest @xmath0 , high - luminosity quasars with narrow emission , do not have high metallicities for their smbh masses and luminosities .",
    "our earlier work ( warner et al . 2003 ) is consistent with the theory that host galaxy mass , correlated with smbh mass ( and agn luminosity ) , is the fundamental parameter affecting blr metallicity .",
    "we conclude that i ) there must be some secondary effect enhancing the metallicity in nls1s , and ii ) this secondary effect is not related to @xmath0 .    _",
