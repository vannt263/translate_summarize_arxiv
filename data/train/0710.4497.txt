    "a companion article  @xcite in this volume investigates curves of finite total curvature .",
    "this class includes both smooth and polygonal curves , and allows a unified treatment of curvature .",
    "here we briefly review the theory of smooth curves from the point of view we will later adopt for surfaces .",
    "the  @xmath1 ( which we usually assume is parametrized by its arclength  @xmath2 ) are the local properties of its shape , invariant under euclidean motions .",
    "the only first - order information is the tangent line ; since all lines in space are equivalent , there are no first - order invariants . second - order information ( again , independent of parametrization )",
    "is given by the osculating circle ; the one corresponding invariant is its curvature @xmath3 .",
    "( for a plane curve given as a graph @xmath4 let us contrast the notions of curvature  @xmath5 and second derivative  @xmath6 . at a point  @xmath7 on the curve , we can find either one by translating  @xmath7 to the origin , transforming so the curve is horizontal there , and then looking at the second - order behavior .",
    "the difference is that for curvature , the transformation is a euclidean rotation , while for second derivative , it is a shear @xmath8 .",
    "a  parabola has constant second derivative @xmath6 because it looks the same at any two points after a shear .",
    "a circle , on the other hand , has constant curvature because it looks the same at any two points after a rotation . )",
    "a plane curve is completely determined ( up to rigid motion ) by its ( signed ) curvature  @xmath9 as a function of arclength @xmath2 . for a space curve , however , we need to look at the third - order invariants ; these are the torsion  @xmath10 and the derivative  @xmath11 , but the latter of course gives no new information .",
    "curvature and torsion now form a complete set of invariants : a space curve is determined by  @xmath9 and  @xmath12 .",
    "generically speaking , while second - order curvatures usually suffice to determine a hypersurface ( of codimension  @xmath13 ) , higher - order invariants are needed for higher codimension . for curves in  @xmath14 , for instance , we need @xmath15 generalized curvatures , of order up to  @xmath16 , to characterize the shape .",
    "let us examine the case of space curves @xmath17 in more detail .",
    "at every point @xmath18 we have a splitting of the tangent space  @xmath19 into the tangent line  @xmath20 and the normal plane .",
    "a framing along  @xmath1 is a smooth choice of a unit normal vector  @xmath21 , which is then completed to the oriented orthonormal frame @xmath22 for  @xmath0 , where @xmath23 . taking the derivative with respect to arclength",
    ", we get a skew - symmetric matrix ( an infinitesimal rotation ) that describes how the frame changes : @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is the _ curvature vector _ of  @xmath1 , while  @xmath10 measures the twisting of the chosen orthonormal frame .",
    "if we fix @xmath21 at some basepoint along  @xmath1 , then one natural framing is the or _ bishop frame _  @xcite defined by the condition  @xmath26 .",
    "equivalently , the vectors  @xmath27 are parallel - transported along  @xmath1 from the basepoint , using the riemannian connection on the normal bundle induced by the immersion in  @xmath0 .",
    "one should note that this is not necessarily a closed framing along a closed loop  @xmath1 ; when we return to the basepoint , the vector  @xmath21 has been rotated through an angle called the of  @xmath1 .",
    "other framings are also often useful .",
    "for instance , if  @xmath1 lies on a surface  @xmath28 with unit normal  @xmath29 , it is natural to choose @xmath30",
    ". then @xmath31 is called the _ cornormal _ vector , and",
    "@xmath32 is the ( adapted to @xmath33 ) .",
    "the curvature vector of  @xmath1 decomposes into parts tangent and normal to  @xmath28 as @xmath34 . here",
    ", @xmath35 measures the _ normal curvature _ of  @xmath28 in the direction  @xmath36 , and is independent of  @xmath1 , while  @xmath37 , the _ geodesic curvature _ of  @xmath1 in  @xmath28 , is an intrinsic notion , showing how  @xmath1 sits in  @xmath28 , and is unchanged if we isometrically deform the immersion of  @xmath28 into space .    when the curvature vector of  @xmath1 never vanishes , we can write it as @xmath38 , where  @xmath39  is a unit vector , the _ principal normal _ , and @xmath40",
    ". this yields the orthonormal @xmath41 , whose twisting  @xmath10 is the _ torsion _ of  @xmath1 .",
    "the _ total curvature _ of a smooth curve is @xmath42 . in",
    "@xcite we review a number of standard results : for closed curves , the total curvature is at least  @xmath43 ( fenchel ) and for knotted space curves the total curvature is at least @xmath44 ( fry / milnor ) . for plane curves , we can consider instead the signed curvature , and find that @xmath42 is always an integral multiple of  @xmath43 .",
    "suppose ( following milnor ) we define the total curvature of a polygonal curve simply to be the sum of the turning angles at the vertices .",
    "then , as we explain in  @xcite , all these theorems on total curvature remain true .",
    "our goal , when defining curvatures for polyhedral surfaces , will be to ensure that similar integral relations remain true .",
    "given a ( two - dimensional , oriented ) surface  @xmath28 smoothly immersed in  @xmath0 , we understand its local shape by looking at the @xmath45 given by the unit normal vector @xmath46 at each point @xmath47 .",
    "the derivative of the / map at  @xmath7 is a linear map from  @xmath48 to  @xmath49 .",
    "since these spaces are naturally identified , being parallel planes in  @xmath0 , we can view the derivative as an endomorphism @xmath50 .",
    "the map  @xmath51 is called the ( or weingarten map ) .",
    "the shape operator is the complete second - order invariant ( or curvature ) which determines the original surface  @xmath28 .",
    "( this statement has been left intentionally a bit vague , since without a standard parametrization like arclength , it is not quite clear how one should specify such an operator along an unknown surface . ) usually , however , it is more convenient to work not with the operator  @xmath51 but instead with scalar quantities .",
    "its eigenvalues  @xmath52 and  @xmath53 are called the _ principal curvatures _ , and ( since they can not be globally distinguished ) it is their symmetric functions which have the most geometric meaning .",
    "we define the @xmath54 as the determinant of @xmath51 and the _ mean curvature _ @xmath55 as its trace . note that the sign of @xmath56 depends on the choice of unit normal @xmath29 ,",
    "so often it is more natural to work with the _ vector mean curvature _ ( or mean curvature vector ) @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , some authors use the opposite sign on  @xmath51 and thus  @xmath58 , and many use @xmath59 , justifying the name `` mean '' curvature .",
    "our conventions mean that the mean curvature vector for a convex surface points inwards ( like the curvature vector for a circle ) . for a unit sphere oriented with inward normal ,",
    "the / map  @xmath29 is the antipodal map , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "the / curvature is an intrinsic notion , depending only on the pullback metric on the surface  @xmath28 , and not on the immersion into space .",
    "that is , @xmath62 is unchanged by bending the surface without stretching it .",
    "for instance , a developable surface like a cylinder or cone has @xmath63 because it is obtained by bending a flat plane .",
    "one intrinsic characterization of @xmath64 is obtained by comparing the circumferences @xmath65 of ( intrinsic ) @xmath66-balls around  @xmath7 to the value @xmath67 in  @xmath68 .",
    "we get @xmath69    mean curvature , on the other hand , is certainly not intrinsic , but it has a nice variational interpretation . consider a variation vectorfield  @xmath70 on  @xmath28 ; for simplicity assume  @xmath70 is compactly supported away from any boundary .",
    "then @xmath71 in the sense that @xmath72 with respect to the @xmath73 inner product @xmath74 on vectorfields , the vector mean curvature is thus the negative gradient of the area functional , often called the first variation of area : @xmath75 .",
    "( similarly , the negative gradient of length for a curve is its curvature vector  @xmath76 . )    just as @xmath5 is the geometric version of second derivative for curves , mean curvature is the geometric version of the laplacian @xmath77 .",
    "indeed , if a surface @xmath28 is written locally near a point  @xmath7 as the graph of a height function  @xmath78 over its tangent plane @xmath79 , then @xmath80 . alternatively , we can write @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the position vector in @xmath0 and @xmath83 is the laplace / beltrami operator , the intrinsic surface laplacian .    we can flow a curve or surface to reduce its length or area , by following the gradient vectorfield @xmath76 or @xmath84 ; the resulting parabolic ( heat ) flow is slightly nonlinear in a natural geometric way .",
    "this so - called _ mean - curvature flow _ has been extensively studied as a geometric smoothing flow .",
    "( see , among many others , @xcite for the curve - shortening flow and @xcite for higher dimensions . )",
    "for surfaces , we will consider various integral curvature relations that relate area integrals over a region @xmath85 to arclength integrals over the boundary @xmath86 .",
    "first , the //bonnet theorem says that , when @xmath87 is a disk , @xmath88 here , @xmath89 is the vector line element along  @xmath1 , and @xmath90 is again the cornormal . in particular , this theorem implies that the total / curvature of  @xmath87 depends only on a collar neighborhood of @xmath1 : if we make any modification to  @xmath87 supported away from the boundary , the total curvature is unchanged ( as long as  @xmath87 remains topologically a disk ) .",
    "we will extend the notion of ( total ) / curvature from smooth surfaces to more general surfaces ( in particular polyhedral surfaces ) by requiring that this property remain true .",
    "our other integral relations are all proved by stokes s theorem , and thus require only that  @xmath1 be the boundary of  @xmath87 in a homological sense ; for these @xmath87 need not be a disk .",
    "first consider the @xmath91 the right - hand side represents the total vector area of any surface spanning @xmath1 , and the relation shows this to depend only on  @xmath1 ( and this time not even on a collar neighborhood ) .",
    "the integrand on the left - hand side depends on a choice of origin for the coordinates , but because we integrate over a closed loop , the integral is independent of this choice .",
    "both sides of this vector area formula can be interpreted directly for a polyhedral surface , and the equation remains true in that case .",
    "we note also that this vector area  @xmath92 is one of the quantities preserved when  @xmath1 evolves under the hasimoto or smoke - ring flow @xmath93 .",
    "( compare @xcite . )    a simple application of the fundamental theorem of calculus to the tangent vector of a curve  @xmath1 from  @xmath7 to  @xmath94 shows that @xmath95 this can be viewed as a balance between elastic tension forces trying to shrink the curve , and sideways forces holding it in place .",
    "it is the key step in verifying that the vector curvature @xmath76 is the first variation of length .",
    "the analog for a surface patch  @xmath87 is the mean - curvature equation @xmath96 again this represents a balance between surface tension forces acting in the conormal direction along the boundary of @xmath87 and what can be considered as pressure forces ( espcially in the case of constant  @xmath56 ) acting normally across  @xmath87 .",
    "we will use this equation to develop our analog of mean curvature for discrete surfaces .",
    "the force balance equation can be seen to arise from the translational invariance of curvatures .",
    "it has been important for studying surfaces of constant mean curvature ; see for instance @xcite .",
    "the rotational analog is the following : @xmath97 somewhat related is the following equation : @xmath98 it gives , for example , an interesting expression for the area of a minimal ( @xmath99 ) surface .",
    "for us , a discrete or polyhedral surface @xmath100 will mean a triangulated surface with a continuous map into space , linear on each triangle . in more detail , we start with an abstract combinatorial a simplicial complex  representing a @xmath101-manifold with boundary .",
    "we then pick positions @xmath102 for all the vertices , which uniquely determine a linear map on each triangle ; these maps fit together to form the polyhedral surface .",
    "the union of all triangles containing a vertex  @xmath7 is called @xmath103 , the _ star _ of  @xmath7 . similarly , the union of the two triangles containing an edge  @xmath104 is  @xmath105 .",
    "it is well known how the notion of / curvature extends to such discrete surfaces  @xmath28 .",
    "( banchoff  @xcite was probably the first to discuss this in detail , though he notes that hilbert and cohn - vossen  @xcite had already used a polyhedral analog to motivate the intrinsic nature of / curvature . )",
    "any two adjacent triangles ( or , more generally , any simply connected region in  @xmath28 not including any vertices ) can be flattened ",
    "developed isometrically into the plane .",
    "thus the / curvature is supported on the vertices @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , to keep the //bonnet theorem true , we must take @xmath106 here , the angles  @xmath107 are the interior angles at  @xmath7 of the triangles meeting there , and @xmath108 is often known as the angle defect at  @xmath7 .",
    "if  @xmath87 is any neighborhood of  @xmath7 contained in @xmath103 , then @xmath109 ; when the triangles are acute , this is most easily seen by letting  @xmath110 be the path connecting their circumcenters and crossing each edge perpendicularly .",
    "analogous to our intrinsic characterization of / curvature in the smooth case , note that the circumference of a small @xmath66 ball around  @xmath7 here is exactly @xmath111 .",
    "this version of discrete / curvature is quite natural , and seems to be the correct analog when / curvature is used intrinsically .",
    "but the / curvature of a smooth surface in  @xmath0 also has extrinsic meaning ; for instance the total absolute / curvature is proportional to the average number of critical points of different height functions . for such considerations , brehm and khnel  @xcite suggest the following :",
    "when a vertex  @xmath7 is extreme on the convex hull of its star , but the star itself is not a convex cone , then we should think of  @xmath7 as having both positive and negative curvature .",
    "we let @xmath112 be the curvature at  @xmath7 of the convex hull , and set @xmath113 .",
    "then the absolute curvature at  @xmath7 is @xmath114 , which is greater than @xmath115 .",
    "this discretization , is of course , also based on preserving an integral curvature relation  a different one .",
    "( see also  @xcite . )",
    "we can use the same principle as before  preserving the //bonnet theorem  to define / curvature , as a measure , for much more general surfaces .",
    "for instance , on a piecewise smooth surface , we have ordinary  @xmath62 within each face , a point mass ( again the angle defect ) at each vertex , and a linear density along each edge , equal to the difference in the geodesic curvatures of that edge within its two incident faces .",
    "indeed , clothes are often designed from pieces of ( intrinsically flat ) cloth , joined so that each vertex is intrinsically flat and thus all the curvature is along the edges ; corners would be unsightly in clothes .",
    "returning to polyhedral surfaces , we note that  @xmath108 is clearly an intrinsic notion ( as it should be ) depending only on the angles of each triangle and not on the precise embedding into  @xmath0 .",
    "sometimes it is useful to have a notion of combinatorial curvature , independent of _ all _ geometric information .",
    "given just a combinatorial triangulation , we can pretend that each triangle is equilateral with angles @xmath116 .",
    "( such a euclidean metric with cone points at certain vertices exists on the abstract surface , independent of whether or not it could be embedded in space .",
    "see the survey  @xcite . )",
    "the curvature of this metric , @xmath117 , can be called the _ combinatorial ( / ) curvature _ of the triangulation . ( see  @xcite for combinatorial applications of this notion . ) in this context , the global form @xmath118 of //bonnet amounts to nothing more than euler s formula @xmath119 .",
    "( we note that forman has proposed a combinatorial ricci curvature  @xcite ; although for smooth surfaces , ricci curvature is / curvature , for discrete surfaces forman s combinatorial curvature does not agree with ours , so he fails to recover the //bonnet theorem . )",
    "our discrete / curvature  @xmath108 is of course an integrated quantity .",
    "sometimes it is desirable to have instead a curvature density , dividing  @xmath108 by the surface area associated to the vertex  @xmath7 .",
    "one natural choice is @xmath120 , but this does not always behave nicely for irregular triangulations .",
    "one problem is that , while @xmath108 is intrinsic , depending only on the cone metric of the surface , @xmath121 depends also on the choice of which pairs of cone points are connected by triangle edges .",
    "one fully intrinsic notion of the area associated to  @xmath7 would be the area of its intrinsic voronoi cell in the sense of bobenko and springborn  @xcite ; perhaps this would be the best choice for computing / curvature density .",
    "the formula @xmath122 needs no special interpretation for discrete surfaces : both sides of the equation make sense directly , since the surface normal @xmath29 is well - defined almost everywhere .",
    "however , it is worth interpreting this formula for the case when @xmath87 is the star of a vertex @xmath7 .",
    "more generally , suppose @xmath1 is any closed curve ( smooth or polygonal ) , and @xmath87 is the cone from @xmath7 to @xmath1 ( the union of all line segments @xmath123 for @xmath124 ) .",
    "fixing @xmath1 and letting @xmath7 vary , we find that the volume enclosed by this cone is an affine linear function of @xmath102 , and thus @xmath125 is independent of the position of  @xmath7 .",
    "we also note that any such cone @xmath87 is intrinsically flat except at the cone point @xmath7 , and that @xmath126 is the cone angle at @xmath7 .",
    "the mean curvature of a discrete surface  @xmath28 is supported along the edges .",
    "if @xmath104 is an edge , and @xmath127 , then we set @xmath128 here @xmath129 is the normal vector to the triangle @xmath130 , and the operator @xmath131 rotates by @xmath132 in the plane of that triangle .",
    "note that @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the exterior dihedral angle along the edge , defined by @xmath135 .",
    "no nonplanar discrete surface has @xmath136 along every edge .",
    "but this discrete mean curvature can cancel out around vertices .",
    "we set @xmath137 the area of the discrete surface is a function of the vertex positions ; if we vary only one vertex @xmath7 , we find that @xmath138 .",
    "this mirrors the variational characterization of mean curvature for smooth surfaces , and we see that a natural notion of discrete minimal surfaces is to require @xmath139 for all vertices  @xcite .",
    "suppose that the vertices adjacent to @xmath7 , in cyclic order , are @xmath140 , ",
    ". then we can express  @xmath142 and  @xmath143 explicitly in terms of these neighbors .",
    "we get @xmath144 and similarly @xmath145 where @xmath146 and @xmath147 are the angles opposite edge @xmath148 in the two incident triangles .",
    "this latter equation is the famous `` ''  @xcite which also arises naturally in a finite - element discretization of the laplacian .",
    "suppose we change the combinatorics of a discrete surface  @xmath28 by introducing a new vertex  @xmath7 along an existing edge  @xmath104 and subdividing the two incident triangles .",
    "then @xmath143 in the new surface equals the original @xmath149 , independent of where along  @xmath104 we place  @xmath7 .",
    "this allows a variational interpretation of  @xmath149 .      a somewhat different interpretation of mean curvature for convex polyhedra is found in the context of minkowski s theory of mixed volumes .",
    "( in this simple form , it dates back well before minkowski , to steiner  @xcite . )",
    "if @xmath150 is a smooth convex body in @xmath0 and @xmath151 denotes its @xmath152-neighborhood , then its steiner polynomial is : @xmath153 here , by //bonnet , the last integral is always @xmath44 .",
    "when @xmath150 is instead a convex polyhedron , we already understand how to interpret each term except @xmath154 .",
    "the correct replacement for this term , as steiner discovered , is @xmath155 .",
    "this suggests @xmath156 as a notion of total mean curvature for the edge  @xmath104 .",
    "note the difference between this formula and our earlier @xmath157 .",
    "either one can be derived by replacing the edge @xmath104 with a sector of a cylinder of length  @xmath158 and arbitrary ( small ) radius @xmath159 .",
    "we have @xmath160 , so that @xmath161 the difference is explained by the fact that one formula integrates the scalar mean curvature while the other integrates the vector mean curvature .",
    "again , these two discretizations both arise through preservation of ( different ) integral relations for mean curvature .",
    "see  @xcite for a more extensive discussion of the analogous situation for curves :",
    "although as we have mentioned , the sum of the turning angles  @xmath162 is often the best notion of total curvature for a polygon , in certain situations the `` right '' discretization is instead the sum of @xmath163 or @xmath164 .",
    "the interpretation of curvatures in terms of the mixed volumes or steiner polynomial actually works for arbitrary convex surfaces .",
    "( compare  @xcite in this volume . ) using geometric measure theory  and a generalized normal bundle called the normal cycle  one can extend both / and mean curvature in a similar way to quite general surfaces .",
    "see  @xcite .      a smooth surface which minimizes area under a volume constraint has constant mean curvature",
    "; the constant @xmath56 can be understood as the lagrange multiplier for the constrained minimization problem .",
    "a discrete surface which minimizes area among surfaces of fixed combinatorial type and fixed volume will have constant discrete mean curvature @xmath56 in the sense that at every vertex , @xmath165 , or equivalently @xmath166 .",
    "in general , of course , the vectors @xmath143 and @xmath142 are not even parallel : they give two competing notions of a normal vector to the discrete surface at the vertex  @xmath7 . still , @xmath167 gives a better notion of mean curvature density near  @xmath7 than , say , the smaller quantity @xmath168 where @xmath120 .",
    "suppose we want to discretize the elastic bending energy for surfaces , @xmath169 , known as the .",
    "the discussion above shows why @xmath170 ( which was used in  @xcite ) is a better discretization than @xmath171 ( used fifteen years ago in  @xcite ) .",
    "several related discretizations are by now built into brakke s evolver ; see the discusion in  @xcite .",
    "recently , bobenko  @xcite has described a completely different approach to discretizing the willmore energy , which respects the mbius invariance of the smooth energy .      as mentioned above",
    ", we can define a _ discrete minimal surface _ to be a polyhedral surface with @xmath139 .",
    "an early impetus to the field of discrete differential geometry was the realization ( starting with  @xcite ) that discrete minimal surfaces are not only critical points for area ( fixing the combinatorics ) , but also have other properties similar to those of smooth minimal surfaces .    for instance , in a conformal parameterization of a smooth minimal surface , the coordinate functions are harmonic . to interpret this for discrete surfaces ,",
    "we are led to the question of when a discrete map should be considered conformal .",
    "in general this is still open .",
    "( interesting suggestions come from the theory of circle packings , and this is an area of active research .",
    "see for instance  @xcite . )",
    "however , we should certainly agree that the identity map is conformal .",
    "a polyhedral surface @xmath28 comes with an embedding @xmath172 which we consider as the identity map .",
