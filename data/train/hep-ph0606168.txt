    "quantum chromodynamics is made special among phenomenologically relevant field theories by the property of confinement . given that the lagrangian is written in terms of fields that do not appear in the construction of the true asymptotic states of the theory , it may seem surprising that perturbative calculations performed around the trivial vacuum have any relevance at all . the predictive power of perturbative qcd , in the presence of a kinematic scale @xmath2 much larger than the confinement scale @xmath3 , is rescued by asymptotic freedom , combined with quantum - mechanical incoherence and gauge invariance .",
    "these are the necessary ingredients entering the proof of factorization theorems  @xcite , which are the cornerstones of all pqcd calculations .",
    "factorization theorems in essence provide a bound for the parametric size of nonperturbative corrections to high energy inclusive cross sections .",
    "such corrections are typically suppressed by powers of the hard scale @xmath2 . it should be emphasized , however , that factorization theorems are proven perturbatively , by examining the all - order structure of long - distance singularities in feynman diagrams .",
    "their phenomenological relevance must then rely upon the additional ( if plausible ) assumption that confinement be a relatively soft process , happening without a violent rearrengement of momentum configurations , as colored particles evolve away from the hard scattering event .",
    "decades of experience with qcd phenomenology have taught us that this assumption is very well borne out by the data .",
    "indeed , granted this assumption , the bound on the size of nonperturbative effects provided by the factorization theorem is the first and simplest case of nonperturbative information extracted form qcd by purely perturbative methods .    the general idea that perturbation theory ,",
    "whenever genuine all - order information is available , can provide important clues to understand nonperturbative effects , has subsequently been applied successfully in a variety of situations .",
    "typically , the perturbative expansion is found to diverge , and the uncertainty in the physical prediction due to this divergence is interpreted as a measure of the size of the expected nonperturbative correction . specifically , the nonperturbative contribution must be ambiguous by an amount matching the uncertainty in the perturbative prediction .",
    "the assumption that the actual size of the nonperturbative corrections should be well represented by this ambiguity is sometimes referred to as ultraviolet dominance of power corrections  @xcite .",
    "the all - order perturbative information required to begin any study of power corrections has mostly been provided by two complementary sources : renormalon - type calculations ( reviewed in @xcite ) , which roughly speaking target running - coupling effects by summing up fermion bubble corrections to single gluon emission , and soft gluon resummations , which make use factorization and universality to compute leading multigluon contributions in the soft and collinear limits ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , it was shown that the two appoaches can be combined @xcite , yielding a strongly constrained and rather elegant model of power corrections in the sudakov region .",
    "event shape distributions in hard collisions are an especially interesting class of observables for power correction studies , and indeed a lot work has been done in the past several years on the subject , especially in the context of @xmath0 annihilation and dis  @xcite .",
    "event shape distributions , in fact , provide a continuous interpolation between processes featuring mostly hard , perturbative radiation and configurations dominated by soft and collinear gluon emission .",
    "the corresponding theoretical prediction must then be constructed matching a variety of tools : nlo perturbative results for hard emissions , soft gluon resummations when the value of the event shape forces radiation to be soft , and finally models of power corrections very close to threshold .",
    "in general , models of power corrections involve nonperturbative parameters or functions , which must be determined from experiment , much as one does with parton distributions . the predictive power of these models must then rely on a degree of universality of soft radiation , which is well understood in perturbation theory , and must be assumend to hold nonperturbatively as well . by comparing theoretical predictions for",
    "different but related event shapes one can then test our understanding of qcd at or beyond the strict limits of applicability of perturbation theory .",
    "the application of these techniques has lead in recent years to quantitatively testable and quite successful models of power corrections . here",
    "i will mostly discuss results obtained by dressed gluon exponentiation ( dge ) @xcite , as applied to thrust @xcite , the c - parameter @xcite , and the class of angularities @xcite .",
    "these examples show that current tools lead to simple , analytical , quantitative results that can readily be compared with experimental data .",

    "the fact that @xmath25 dpends on the scale @xmath27 , however , has important consequences on power corrections , as discussed below",
    ".      one can deduce from ( where the integration variable @xmath28 in the exponent plays the role of @xmath16 ) that for small values of @xmath16 there are two relevant momentum scales : @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this can be understood from the physical picture underlying sudakov factorization : at small @xmath16 gluon radiation can be organized into jets of particles collinear to the primary partons , with invariant mass proportional to @xmath31 , plus the contribution of wide - angle soft gluons , characterized by their total energy @xmath32 .",
    "it is natural to expect that power corrections will be organized by these two scales , and thus be of the form @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively . clearly , when @xmath35 all power corrections of this second kind become important , and must be collectively taken into account .",
    "power corrections in the larger scale , on the other hand , become important only when @xmath36 , a value which is too small to be relevant for lep fits .",
    "the need for power corrections is apparent in , since the integrals over momentum scales are perturbatively ill - defined because of the landau singularity of the running coupling .",

    "the basic assumptions are the applicability of the factorization underlying all the way down to values of @xmath16 such that @xmath37 , and the existence of a nonperturbative definition of the running coupling rendering the scale integrals well defined .",

    "renormalons arise when taking moments of the distribution , because of the convergence constraints on the borel integral at small values of @xmath16 .",
    "one also notes that the first term in is associated with soft wide - angle radiation , since it generates in terms proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "similarly , the second term in is associated with the jet function , contaning collinear as well as soft enhancements .",
    "the key step in dge is to note that at ll level sudakov resummation yields a simple exponentiation of the one - gluon emission cross section in moment space .",
    "one can then retain all large-@xmath47 information , and the corresponding model of power corrections , in the sudakov exponent by simply using the single dressed gluon cross section as kernel of exponentiation .",

    "first of all , the borel functions contain perturbative information on sudakov logarithms : although the exponentiation was performed assuming independent gluon radiation , it can be shown  @xcite that one can upgrade the formalism to nll accuracy by simply replacing the running coupling with the two - loop expression , and by changing renormalization scheme , including in the constant @xmath62 the contribution of terms singular as @xmath63 in the nlo altarelli - parisi splitting function ( the `` gluon bremsstrahlung '' scheme  @xcite ) . beyond nll ,",
    "the coefficients of all subleading logarithms can be computed in the large @xmath47 limit , by simply expanding the borel function in powers of @xmath28 , and replacing @xmath64 .",
    "computing subleading logarithms uncovers the factorial growth of their coefficients , and can be used to gauge the reliability of perturbative resummation in different kinematical regimes .",
    "next , one may observe that the infrared safety of @xmath16 and @xmath1 is once again reflected in the cancellation of the poles of both borel functions at @xmath58 .",
    "one also notes that wide - angle soft radiation and collinear gluons contribute as before two separate terms , and the jet functions ( the terms proportional to @xmath65 ) are identical for the two observables is computed for a rescaled @xmath1 parameter , @xmath66 .",
    "they contribute renormalons at @xmath67 , corresponding to exponentiated power corrections of the form @xmath68 .",
    "soft gluon contributions , on the other hand , have renormalons at @xmath69 , for all odd values of @xmath5 , yielding the leading power corrections @xmath70 , and they are quantitatively different for @xmath16 and @xmath1 , distinguishing the two observables .",
    "specifically , by taking the ratio of the two `` soft functions '' ( the terms proportional to @xmath71 ) and expanding in powers of @xmath28 , one can verify that the two observables begin to differ perturbatively at nnll level , as predicted in  @xcite , but the growth of the coefficients of further subleading logarithms is weaker for the @xmath1-parameter than for the thrust .",
    "similarly , if one boldly takes the large-@xmath47 residues of the poles of the borel functions as a reasonable estimate of the size of the corresponding power corrections , one observes that @xmath72 corrections are systematically smaller for the @xmath1 parameter : the two shape functions should therefore differ , and one expects that the resummed perturbative prediction , as well as the approximation of the shape function by a constant shift , should work better phenomenologically for @xmath1 than for @xmath16 .",
    "the discussion in sect .",
    "( [ soft ] ) illustrates the predictive power of dge .",
    "another interesting application concerns angularities , whose definition , , can be rewritten for massless particles as _ a = _ i _ i ( _ i ) ^a ( 1 - | _",

    "angularities ( so christened in @xcite ) were introduced in @xcite as auxiliary shape variables used to tame nonglobal logarithms  @xcite for observables related to out - of - jet energy flow .",

    "the scaling rule was tested against the output of pythia , with positive results  @xcite .",
    "the physical picture underlying the scaling rule is appealing , and once again reminiscent of the `` tube model '' .",
    "the relevant feature of the radiation pattern is boost invariance , which applies to soft gluons emitted in the two - jet limit , since such emissions are correctly represented by the eikonal approximation .",
    "this means that soft gluons contribute to the event shape a rapidity - independent amount , and in turn the integration over rapidity simply measures the size of the region where gluons can be emitted without strongly affecting the event shape .",

    "the derivation of the scaling rule neglects correlations between gluons emitted into the opposite hemispheres defined by the thrust axis , which however are expected to become important only for @xmath87 , the region excluded by the present treatment .",

    "( [ soft ] ) , it is interesting to verify whether these nice features of angularities are preserved in specific models for the shape function , such as dge .",
    "this is particularly relevant in this case , since the key result , , is related to boost invariance , which is broken by the formal introduction of gluon virtuality , which is a necessary tool of renormalon analysis .",
    "the study of angularities with dge was performed in  @xcite .",
    "it is technically nontrivial , since the interplay of the parameter @xmath74 with gluon virtuality and phase space constraints makes it difficult to extract the @xmath74 dependence analytically .",

    "one such definition is _ a =  , [ defo ] where @xmath90 are the customary energy fraction variables , and the definition applies to the phase space region where the gluon is soft ; @xmath91 is then the ( anti)quark energy fraction . with this definition , it is possible to construct the borel function for the sudakov exponent for angularities , in analogy with eqs .",
    "( [ bnut ] ) and ( [ bnuc ] ) .",

    "collinear power corrections are much more difficult to handle analitycally , and the collinear counterpart of can at best be expressed in terms of a one - dimensional integral representation , which reduces to combinations of hypergeometric functions for rational values of @xmath74 .",
    "this is however enough to classify the singularities in the borel parameter @xmath28 , and thus the pattern of power corrections .",
    "one indeed finds that all these subleading power corrections can be organized in a single shape function @xmath92 , depending only on the combination @xmath93 , as in .",
    "dge thus confirms the general scaling behavior found from resummation , showing that the introduction of gluon virtuality does not spoil the effects of boost invariance in the sudakov limit .",

    "as we approach the expected date for the start up of the large hadron collider at cern , it is natural and appropriate to ask whether tools like those described here could be applicable in the environment of hadron collisions , and , if so , to what extent power corrections might be relevant to our understanding of the data , at the extreme energies available at the lhc . beginning with the second question",
    ", one might naively observe that @xmath94 must be a very small number for any reasonable value of the hard scale @xmath95 that one might envisage at the lhc .",
    "it would not be wise , however , to neglect power correction studies on this basis , for at least three different reasons .",
    "first of all , it has already been shown at the tevatron that power corrections have an impact even on observables which are largely dominated by high @xmath96 events , and even at very high energy  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , mangano considered the single - jet inclusive @xmath97 distribution , comparing data at different cm energies .",
    "one sees that ratios of cross sections at different energies do not have the proper scaling behavior dictated by nlo qcd , but the correct behavior can be recovered by including a power correction determined by a single parameter associated with the normalization of the jet transverse energy .",
    "the reason is that even a small shift in the jet @xmath97 is amplified in the distribution by the fact that the cross section is falling steeply for increasing @xmath97 , so that @xmath98 if @xmath99 .",
    "one can expect that in general power corrections will be important for the determination of jet energy scales , and in turn accurate knowledge of these scales may well turn out to be crucial for many high energy studies .",
    "the second reason is that almost any lhc observable will require , before it can be compared with a theoretical prediction , a subtraction of all hadronic activity unrelated to the hard scattering , loosely referred to as `` underlying event '' .",
    "there is currently very little , if any , theoretical control on the underlying event , which at the lhc will contain a mix of multiple parton scattering , beam - beam interactions and soft radiation associated with the selected hard process .",
    "even monte - carlo methods have difficulties in finding the proper tuning to describe this kind of physics ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) . in this context",
    ", the lesson of power correction studies in the gentler environment of @xmath0 annihilation or dis is that we might learn to discriminate between the different components of soft radiation in hadron collisions .",
    "on the one hand there are soft and collinear gluons associated with the hard scattering event : their effects are in principle computable in pqcd , using generalizations of the known techniques , and their distribution in phase space and in the space of color configurations will be nontrivial and predictable .",
    "on the other hand , there is soft radiation which is in practice out of reach for the techniques of pqcd , such as minijets due to multiple parton scattering or soft gluons arising from beam - beam interactions .",
    "this second kind of radiation fills phase space with a high degree of uniformity , and will have to be modelled with different techniques , including monte - carlo tools .",
    "this kind of statistical modelling is bound to be more successful if we can first achieve a better understanding of the `` pure '' hard scattering process , including the energy and color flow that it generates at all scales .    finally , it should be emphasized that the physics of event shapes at hadron colliders is interesting for its own sake , as a probe to understand hadronization in terms of both momentum and color flow .",
    "it is well known that for hadron collisions , where most processes involve four partons already at born level , sudakov resummation is expressed in terms of anomalous dimension matrices that tie together color exchange and momentum flow .",
    "this interplay is bound to influence the pattern of power corrections as well , and studies of this kind may well lead to deep insights into the mechanics of color neutralization and hadron formation .",
    "preliminary studies of resummed event shapes at hadron colliders have already been performed  @xcite , and a generalization of the notion of angularity to a hadronic environment has been proposed  @xcite . for most of these proposals ,",
    "a primary concern is that of suppressing the contributions of particles close to the beam axis , where beam remnants interfere with all measurements .",
    "it should be noted , however , that soft radiation associated with the underlying event tends to fill phase space , including regions separated in rapidity from both the beam and the high-@xmath96 jets .",
    "it would therefore be of great interest to find event shapes designed to focus on this kind of wide - angle radiation , where it would be most useful to disentangle soft gluons generated by the hard scattering from the genuine underlying event ( a pioneering study with a similar goal is  @xcite ) .",
    "a promising avenue of investigation might be the use of observables such as those introduced in  @xcite , joint distributions correlating energy flow in a chosen angular region @xmath100 with a standard event shape such as ordinary angularity .",
    "the form of such a correlation is ( _ 1 , _ 2 , a ) = _ n ( _ 1 - f_(n ) ) ( _ 2 - _ a^(1 ) ( n ) - _ a^(2 ) ( n ) )  , [ esefc ] where @xmath101 is an observable related to energy flow into the angular region @xmath100 , away from hard jets , while @xmath102 are the contributions to angularity from the two hemispheres defined by the thrust axis .    in a hadronic environment , one might envisage measuring angularities with respect to the current jet axis , as suggested in  @xcite , or even introducing a third parameter @xmath103 to constrain radiation near the beam remnants . tuning the various parameters and energy threshold in such observables one would be able to focus on different regions of phase space , forcing the observable to be more or less inclusive for soft gluons , or for particles collinear either to the beam or to the current jets .",
    "notice that boost invariance , underlying the scaling rule for angularities , is lost in hadron collisions , where correlations between beam jets and current jets must be taken into account .",
    "clearly , event shape studies at hadron colliders are in their early days .",
    "i believe that such studies will be both instrumental to further our understanding of qcd , and very helpful in order to exploit the full potential of the lhc , a task which will require a solid understanding of strong interactions as much as good skills in the building and testing of new physics models .",
    "i would like to thank carola berger and einan gardi , who worked with me on the research described here , and went over the draft of this contribution , spotting several misprints and one significant inaccuracy , now fixed .",
    "i also thank george sterman and mrinal dasgupta for sharing their insights , and the organizers and frif for the opportunity granted by the workshop , which was conducted in a friendly and constructive atmosphere .",
    "this work was supported in part by miur under contract @xmath104 .",
