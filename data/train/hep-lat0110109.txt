    "the critical wavenumber @xmath0 which separates low and high momentum behaviors is determined by the thermodynamic potential which governs the long wavelength behavior of the system .",
    "we have previously shown that the confined phase of pure @xmath2 gauge theory decays via spinodal decomposition after a rapid change from below the deconfinement temperature to temperatures above@xcite .",
    "the first order character of the deconfinement transition in pure @xmath3 gauge theory implies that the confined phase is metastable for a range of temperatures above the deconfinement temperature @xmath4 at higher temperatures @xmath5 the confined phase is unstable and decays via spinodal decomposition .",
    "the spinodal temperature @xmath6 separates the metastable and spinodal temperature ranges .",
    "as a consequence of asymptotic freedom , the perturbative form of the effective potential for the polyakove loop at high temperatures is valid . writing the polyakov loop in the form @xmath7 , the perturbative form of the effective action is at 1 loop @xcite@xcite@xcite @xmath8 where the constant black body term has been discarded .",
    "we assume that the long distance behavior of the polyakov loop 2-point function can be calculated using the 1-loop perturbative effective action @xmath9 and the langevin equation , @xmath10 where @xmath11 , the gaussian noise term , is such that the equipartition theorem holds@xcite .",
    "a linearized solution to the langevin equation gives for the polyakov loop 2-point function ( also refered to as the structure function ) @xmath12 where @xmath13",
    "when the equation is linearized about @xmath14 the mass squared is negative @xmath15 causing exponential growth for values of the wavenumber less than the critical value @xmath0 . at late times , the equation is linearized about the non - trivial minimum at @xmath16 . here",
    "the mass is the debye screening mass @xmath17 and the system relaxes to the non - trivial minimum .",
    "after integrating out all other fields at the scale @xmath18 we are left with an action just in terms of the polyakov loop .",
    "the minimal landau - ginsberg action which is gauge invariant , @xmath19 invariant , and only involves terms up to the fourth power in the polyakov loop is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the trace of the polyakov loop in the fundamental representation . the langevin equation without noise is then used as an ansatz for the evolution of the low momentum modes . in fourier space",

    "the potential obtained above has a minimum which is not the equilibrium value of the vacuum expectation value of the polyakov loop(see figure 2 ) .",

    "the absolute normalization of the coefficients of the effective potential can not be determined .",
    "however the ratio of the curvature at the nontrivial minimum to the curvature at zero is equal to the ratio of the square of the debye mass to the square of the critical wavenumber @xmath29 which is comparable to the perturbative result for this ratio .",

    "the initial exponential rise in the structure function is evident . at intermediate times",
    "the growth levels off , with the appearance of `` shelves '' in some of the modes which is presumably a consequence of mode - mode coupling . at late times",
