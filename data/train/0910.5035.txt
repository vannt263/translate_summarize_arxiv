    "compact symmetric objects ( csos ) are characterized by compact bright radio emission at scales @xmath1kpc with lobes on both sides of a central engine ( wilkinson et al.@xmath01994 ) .",
    "csos tend to be associated with bright elliptical galaxies , although some appear to be associated with quasars and even spiral galaxies ( readhead et al.@xmath01996 ; augusto et al.@xmath02006 ; perlman et al.@xmath01996 ) .",
    "many csos have an overall gigahertz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) , and the cores are often undetected at frequencies of 5@xmath0ghz or higher ( taylor et al.@xmath01996 ) .",
    "csos are very luminous radio sources , significantly brighter ( by more than a factor of 10 ) than the luminosity threshold between fr@xmath0i and ii radio galaxies ( i.e. , @xmath2w@xmath0hz@xmath3sr@xmath3 at 178@xmath0mhz , fanaroff & riley 1974 ; readhead et al.@xmath01996 ) .",
    "it has been proposed that the small source size could be caused by `` frustration '' of the radio jets , which fail to escape from a dense galactic medium ( e.g. , van breugel et al.@xmath01984 ; odea et al.@xmath01991 ; de young 1993 ) . however",
    ", a different scenario is currently preferred : csos may be young progenitors ( @xmath410@xmath5  10@xmath6years ) of powerful extended radio sources ( e.g. , phillips & mutel 1982 ; augusto et al.@xmath02006 ; augusto 2007 ) . based on xmm - newton observations of five csos , vink et al.@xmath0(2006 ) found that their absorption column density ( @xmath7@xmath8 ) is on average greater than that of broad - line radio galaxies , but similar to column densities observed toward narrow - line and other types of radio galaxies ( nlrgs , rg ; see sambruna et al.@xmath01999 for definitions ) .",
    "these results argue against the frustration scenario because much higher x - ray absorption column densities than found by vink et al .",
    "( 2006 ) are expected if the expansion of the radio jets were confined ( see also guainazzi et al . 2006 ) .",
    "in contrast , the dynamical age of csos measured from the expansion velocity of hotspots in the radio lobes supports the youth hypothesis ( taylor et al.@xmath02000 , polatidis & conway 2003 ) .",
    "the youth interpretation is also supported by limits on molecular gas content ( odea et al.@xmath02005 ) ,  observations ( pihlstrm et al.@xmath02003 ) , and under - luminous o@xmath0iii line emission ( vink et al.@xmath02006 ) .",
    "the study of csos is therefore fundamental for the understanding of the formation and evolution of radio galaxies .",
    "in addition , csos are good candidates to investigate the fueling of supermassive black holes given that the compact radio emission enables very high angular resolution observations of circumnuclear gas via absorption studies . in this work we report high sensitivity and high angular resolution observations of  toward b2352 + 495 ; an archetype of the cso class .      according to curran et al.@xmath0(2008 ) ,  absorption associated with sources at redshifts greater than @xmath9 has been detected toward 37 sources , 13 of them classified as csos , gps , or hfp ( high frequency peaked ) sources .",
    "an overview of  absorption in compact radio sources was published by vermeulen et al.@xmath0(2003a ) .",
    "they report an  detection rate of @xmath10 based on westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) observations of 59 sources ( i.e. , 19 detections ) . of the 59 sources ,",
    "11 were classified as cso by augusto et al.@xmath0(2006 ) and polatidis & conway ( 2003 ) . from this subsample of 11 csos ,",
    "6 ( 54@xmath11 ) show  absorption .",
    "other studies show similar results , e.g. , peck & taylor ( 2001 ) report a cso  detection rate of @xmath12 , and gupta et al.@xmath0(2006 ) report a detection rate of @xmath13 in gps sources ( see also vermeulen 2002 ) .",
    "the optical depth range of the 6 csos with  absorption from vermeulen et al.@xmath0(2003a ) is 0.2 to 1.7@xmath11 , with linewidths between 13 and 297  and column densities between @xmath14 and @xmath15@xmath8 . to estimate  column densities , vermeulen et al.@xmath0(2003a )",
    "assumed that the atomic gas was uniformly covering the radio continuum ( covering factor of 1 ) and a spin temperature of 100@xmath0k , that may underestimate the spin temperature by more than an order of magnitude if the gas were located at parsec - scales from the agn .",
    "thus , the column densities reported by vermeulen et al.@xmath0(2003a ) are lower limits .    including the results reported in this work ,  imaging at high angular resolution",
    "has been reported toward five csos ( table  1 ) .",
    "we also list in table  1 all non - cso agn and starbursts that have been imaged at high angular resolution in , i.e. , in interferometric observations using baselines greater than 100@xmath0 km .",
    "in the rest of this section we review the most salient characteristics of the csos that have been studied in  at high angular resolution :    _  b1946 + 708 : _ high angular resolution  observations were conducted by peck et al.@xmath0(1999 ; see also peck & taylor 2001 ) .",

    "the maximum optical depth of the lines is @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "mirabel ( 1990 ) interpreted the narrow absorption as being caused by clouds similar to high velocity  clouds in our galaxy .    _",
    " 4c@xmath037.11 : _ in contrast to the two previous csos ,  in 4c@xmath037.11 has been detected only toward one of the radio lobes .",

    "the peak optical depth of the  lines is @xmath22 .",
    "rodrguez et al.@xmath0(2009 ) concluded that the  absorption likely originates in a thick circumnuclear torus .    _",

    "the  optical depth is @xmath24 and the line is quite narrow , between 16 and 18 .",
    "perlman et al.@xmath0(2002 ) concluded that the  absorption is likely from a giant molecular cloud in the outer disk of the host galaxy .",
    "although pks@xmath23 was classified by perlman et al.@xmath0(1996 ) and gugliucci et al.@xmath0(2005 ) as a cso , it has several characteristics that differ form a typical cso . in particular , it was originally classified as a bl lac object based on its optical spectrum ( bregman et al . 1981 ) , the nucleus dominates by more than 50@xmath11 of the total cm flux density , the radio emission is variable , and the host appears to be a spiral galaxy ( see perlman et al.@xmath01996 ) .    finally , two additional sources ( b1934@xmath25638 and 4c@xmath012.50 ) are worth discussing in detail .",
    "b1934@xmath25638 is a compact - double gps source that has been classified as a cso ( augusto et al .",
    "2006 ) , however , no flat - spectrum radio core has been detected ( tzioumis et al . 2002 ) . even though no  imaging has been reported at high angular resolution",
    ", the  absorption is against the compact radio continuum as shown by detection of absorption with three baselines of the lba ( vron - cetty et al .",
    "the absorption is narrow ( fwhm = 18 ) and redshifted 260  from the optical systemic velocity , thus , the  is probably not located in the nuclear region of the galaxy .",
    "we include b1934@xmath25638 in table  1 although no vlbi  imaging is available and the radio core has not been detected .    in the case of 4c@xmath012.50 ,",
    "high angular resolution  absorption observations were reported by morganti et al.@xmath0(2004 ) .",
    "they found  absorption against a weak counterjet and concluded that the  likely traces a jet / cloud interaction and not a circumnuclear torus or disk .",
    "this source was classified as a cso by lister et al.@xmath0(2003 ) despite several atypical characteristics .",
    "for instance , while the 1.3@xmath0ghz continuum image reveals a s - shaped distribution with a total extend of @xmath26pc ( morganti et al.@xmath02004 ) , the 15@xmath0ghz vlba observations are consistent with a core - jet morphology plus a weak counterjet ( i.e. , inconsistent with the typical symmetrical morphology of csos ) .",
    "4c@xmath012.50 has no clear hotspots , it is classified as a css ( compact steep spectrum ) , the radio jet exhibits superluminal motions , some isolated features have unusually high ( @xmath27 ) linear polarization in comparison to other csos , and more importantly , there appears to be continuity between the @xmath26pc compact radio jets and large scale ( @xmath28kpc ) radio lobes ( stanghellini et al.@xmath02005 ) .",

    "taylor et al.@xmath0(1996 ) detected the radio core of the system , i.e. , the putative location of the central engine .",
    "the core is approximately located symmetrically between the radio lobes , and drives a collimated jet that is brighter toward the northern side of the core .",

    "given the non - standard frequency of the observations , a reliable flux density calibration using the t@xmath58 method was not possible , thus we scaled the flux density to a total radio continuum emission of 2.55@xmath0jy at 1.14@xmath0ghz .",
    "this value was obtained by interpolating the flux density measurements reported by readhead et al.@xmath0 ( 1996 ) .",
    "the use of the readhead et al.@xmath0(1996 ) values to interpolate the flux density is valid because the radio emission is dominated by extended radio lobes ( see below ) and not by a compact core ( and thus it is less likely to exhibit strong variability ) . despite the uncertainty on the flux density calibration , the peak flux density values of the narrow and broad  lines detected in this work are very similar to those obtained with wsrt ( vermeulen et al.@xmath02003a ) .",
    "in addition , our discussion of  absorption is based on opacity considerations , which are not affected by systematic flux density calibration errors .",
    "we transferred the self - calibration tables from the continuum data set to the line file , and subtracted the radio continuum using the task uvlin in aips .",
    "we used a brigg s robust 0 weighting for the final imaging that resulted in a @xmath59mas ( @xmath60pc linear scale ) , pa = 0.5 , rms = 0.71  ( in continuum ) and 7.1  ( per frequency channel ) .",

    "the radio continuum has a symmetric s - shaped distribution that is consistent with previous radio continuum images of the source ( e.g. , wilkinson et al.@xmath01994 , readhead et al.@xmath01996 , owsianik et al.@xmath01999 ) .",
    "absorption is only detected toward the brightest continuum emission close to the center of the cso . in figure",
    "2 we show the optical depth channel maps ; only signal above 4@xmath62 in the continuum and  data were used to calculate the opacity .",
    "the  absorption spectrum has two features , a broad component ( @xmath63 , fwhm @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) that is almost centered at the systemic velocity of the galaxy (  centroid heliocentric velocity = @xmath66 ; systemic velocity v@xmath56 = 71321@xmath3848 , optical definition ) , and a narrow component ( fwhm @xmath67 ) redshifted from systemic by @xmath68 .",
    "our measurements are therefore consistent with those of vermeulen et al.@xmath0(2003a ) within our velocity resolution.(2003a ) , it should read 1147.0 instead of 1147.2@xmath0mhz . ]",
    "as in the case of the  gas associated with the nucleus of b1946 + 708 ( peck et al.@xmath01999 ) , we estimate the  column density assuming a covering factor of 1 and a spin temperature of 8000@xmath0k , i.e. , assuming that the  gas is directly associated with the agn . using the standard column density / opacity relation ( e.g. , rohlfs & wilson 2000 ) , we estimate a total column density of @xmath69 and @xmath70@xmath8 for the broad and narrow  lines , respectively ( only statistical errors from the fit were used to estimate the column density uncertainty ) .",
    "the values are greater than the b2352 + 495  column densities reported by vermeulen et al.@xmath0(2003a ) , however , as mentioned above , their values are lower limits because of the assumption of uniform coverage of the radio continuum ( which is not the case , see figure  1 ) and the assumption of a lower spin temperature ( @xmath71k ) . if the  clouds have physical dimensions comparable to the synthesized beam ( note that there appears to be structure in the opacity channels , figure  2 ) , then the  density would be between @xmath72 and 10@xmath73@xmath74 , corresponding to total  masses of @xmath75 and @xmath76  for the broad and narrow features , respectively .",
    "if the  absorption profile of the broad component is the superposition of many narrow  features , and assuming a typical optical depth of @xmath77 for the narrow features , then we could not have detected  absorption ( at a @xmath783@xmath62 level ) anywhere except toward the brightest continuum region at the center of the cso ( i.e. , the region where  absorption was indeed detected ) .",
    "this implies that , given our sensitivity limit , our data do not set significant constraints on the scale height of the  distribution .",
    "as discussed below , we favor the interpretation that the broad  component is associated with rotation of a disk / torus around the supermassive black hole in b2352 + 495 .",
    "the detection of a narrow  feature redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity indicates infall .",
    "however , we can not establish whether the  feature is associated with circumnuclear material or with a foreground  cloud in the host galaxy , e.g , whether it is located in the narrow - line region ( nlr ; e.g. , b2050 + 364 , vermeulen et al.@xmath02006 ) or associated with a high velocity cloud .",
    "we note that other studies ( e.g. , van gorkom et al.@xmath01989 , peck & taylor 1998 , conway 1999 ) have also found evidence for infalling material in galaxies with compact radio cores ( see however vermeulen et al.@xmath02003a ) .",
    "we now discuss the nature of the radio continuum having the  absorption . in principle , the brightest 1.14@xmath0ghz continuum source ( located close to the center of the two radio lobes , figure  1 ) is suggestive of the active core , i.e. , the location of the supermassive black hole . however , comparing our continuum data with higher angular resolution observations reveal a different scenario . in figure  3 ( upper panel )",
    "we show our 1.14@xmath0ghz continuum map superimposed on the 15.4@xmath0ghz observations of taylor et al.@xmath0(1996 ) .",
    "both continuum data sets were self - calibrated , and thus no absolute astrometry is available . to overlay the two images",
    ", we used an average offset computed from the peak in the northern and the southern radio lobe emission ; we assume that position shifts due to opacity effects are small there , since their measured separation is the same within the errors at 1.14@xmath0ghz and 15.4@xmath0ghz .",
    "the brightest radio emission at the center of the radio lobes was _ not _ used to estimate the offset .",
    "taylor et al.@xmath0(1996 ) found a compact radio source characterized by an inverted spectral index ( @xmath79 ; @xmath80 ) , which convincingly indicates the location of the active core ( see figure  3 ) . assuming a flat spectral index between 1 and 8@xmath0ghz , the flux density of the core at 1@xmath0ghz is @xmath81mjy .",
    "our  optical depth limit toward the radio core is @xmath820.1 ( 3@xmath62 ) .",
    "a prominent radio jet is detected to the north of the core , and a weaker counterjet to the south ( taylor et al.@xmath01996 ; 2000 ) .",
    "the northern edge of the jet is coincident with the brightest 1.14@xmath0ghz continuum source reported in this work , implying that the  absorption is not against continuum from the core , but radio emission from the jet . among other possibilities ,",
    "the detection of the radio jet and weaker counterjet could be due to relativistic beaming ( see taylor et al.@xmath0[1996 ] for this and other interpretations ) . the  absorption in b2352",
    "+ 495 is thus similar to the absorption observed in b0402 + 379 ( rodrguez et al.@xmath02009 ) and ngc@xmath04151 ( mundell et al.@xmath01995 , 2003 ) where  is detected only toward one side of the radio jet .",
    "it is interesting to note that the radio continuum source toward which the  is detected ( figure  3 ) is the location where the radio jet begins to change its position angle .",
    "this would suggest that , as for example in the case of 3c@xmath0236 ( conway 1999 ) , the  absorption marks the location of a jet / cloud interaction responsible for disturbing ( and possibly bending ) the jet .",
    "however , the b2352@xmath83495 morphology is quite symmetric in both radio lobes which suggests that the deviation of the radio jets is not due to local jet / cloud interactions but governed by the large scale magnetohydrodynamical properties of the galactic nucleus . in the next section ,",
    "we propose a different interpretation for the nature of the  absorption in b2352 + 495 .",
    "it is difficult to reliably investigate the velocity field of the broad  line given that the absorption is only detected toward the central continuum source and , as shown in figure  2 , the velocity field is complex .",
    "nevertheless , a velocity gradient may be present : the two channels with stronger absorption at velocities above 10  from systemic appear to have stronger absorption toward the west , whereas most of the blueshifted absorption is stronger toward the east ( velocity channels @xmath84  from systemic , see figure  2 ) .",
    "figure  4 shows the position - velocity diagram of the broad  absorption line in the east - west direction . as also seen in the individual channel maps ,",
    "there is a hint of a velocity gradient between blueshifted and redshifted material . to illustrate the possible gradient",
    ", we show in figure  3 ( top panel ) the opacity channels that correspond to the rest frame velocities of 17.6 and @xmath85  ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the existence of a velocity gradient is tantalizing given that it is approximately centered at the systemic velocity of the galaxy , and the position angle of the gradient is almost perpendicular to the north - south jet , i.e. , the  gas could be tracing some kind of rotating structure around the supermassive black hole .",
    "we explore this hypothesis in the rest of this section , however , we stress that more sensitive global - vlbi observations are required to confirm the velocity gradient .",
    "to investigate whether rotation around the supermassive back hole is physically plausible , we followed the formulation presented by rodrguez et al.@xmath0(2009 ; see their appendix ) . to model the  rotating structure , we used the position and velocity of the peak optical depth of the 17.6 and @xmath2531.4  channels ( figure  2 ) .",
    "the position of the radio core ( figure  3 upper panel ; see also taylor et al.@xmath01996 ) was assumed to be coincident with the center of mass of the system . for a black hole mass of 10@xmath86  ( snellen et al.@xmath02003 ) and assuming circular trajectories coplanar with the supermassive black hole , we obtain that the orbit of the  clouds from the 17.6 and @xmath2531.4  channels would have a radius of @xmath87pc with an orbital inclination of @xmath88  with respect to the plane of the sky . such an orbit is reasonable",
    "given the expected distribution of atomic clouds around agns ( e.g. , peck 2005 ) .",
    "similar results are obtained in the case that the orbital plane of the  clouds is not coplanar with the supermassive black hole but located above by distances of the order of the projected separation between the agn core and the  absorption .",
    "this estimate is clearly a zero - order approximation because non - radial inhomogeneities in the gravitational field due to stars and gas are neglected .",
    "in addition , the radius of influence of the supermassive black hole ( @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the gravitational constant , @xmath91 is the mass of the black hole , and @xmath92 is the stellar velocity dispersion ; e.g. , neumayer et al .",
    "2007 ) is @xmath93pc , thus , the stellar mass enclosed by the atomic gas is likely comparable to the black hole mass .    in figure  3 ( bottom panel )",
    "we show two possibilities for the nature of the  distribution , i.e. , a thick torus ( characterized by an  scale height similar or greater than the length of the radio source ) or a thin ( most likely warped , e.g. , pringle 1996 ) disk .",
    "the obvious method to discriminate between these possibilities is to check whether there is  toward the southern radio lobe .",
    "however , as mentioned above , our optical depth sensitivity limit does not set significant constraints on the  distribution , i.e. , clouds like those detected toward the brightest radio continuum emission could be present throughout the region .    an indirect approach to discriminate between the models",
    "is to compare our observations with lower angular resolution data .",
    "as mentioned in @xmath94 , the peak flux density measured with wsrt ( vermeulen et al.@xmath02003a ) is approximately the same peak intensity we measured with the vlba ( figure  1 ) and the linewidths are also consistent .",
    "thus , in contrast to other systems where vlbi observations resolve / filter out significant  signal ( e.g. , ic@xmath05063 , oosterloo et al.@xmath02000 ) , the  in b2352 + 495 is compact and mostly distributed along the central continuum source , i.e. , consistent with the thin disk interpretation .",
    "the thin disk interpretation is also circumstantially supported by x - ray observations .",
    "vink et al.@xmath0(2006 ) reported a x - ray absorption column density of @xmath95@xmath8 , which is similar to the column density of the narrow  component , but several times smaller than the value of the broad line .",
    "if the  absorption originates from an inclined ( and warped ) thin disk that does not substantially obscure the agn ( figure  3 , bottom panel ; see also fig . 5 of orienti et al.@xmath02006 )",
    "then as observed , the column density toward the agn derived from x - ray observations is expected to be smaller than that of the neutral disk .",
    "we note that the thin disk interpretation does not necessarily imply a misalignment between the jet and the disk , i.e. , the position angle of the jet changes as a function of distance from the core ( figure  3 ) and the disk could be warped , thus , the jet and disk could be perpendicular at ( sub)parsec scales .",
    "in addition , given that the detection rate of  absorption in csos is @xmath12 ( see @xmath96 ) , it is certainly possible that in some cases the atomic gas is distributed in a circumnuclear structure that is seen in projection only toward one radio lobe / jet .    assuming the orbital parameters from the thin disk model , we now explore the stability of the  disk with respect to gravitational fragmentation .",
    "we used the toomre stability formulation as presented by gallimore et al.@xmath0(1999 ) , i.e. ,    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is the atomic hydrogen surface density , @xmath99 is the critical surface density above which the disk is unstable to fragmentation , @xmath100 is the  column density in units of 10@xmath101@xmath8 , @xmath102 is the rotation velocity in , and @xmath103 is the orbital radius in parsecs . in the case of b2352 + 495",
    "we obtain @xmath104 , thus , the disk is expected to be unstable to fragmentation .",
    "we note that reducing the assumed spin temperature by an order of magnitude would not significantly modify this conclusion , i.e. , @xmath105 would still be @xmath106 .",
    "this simple stability test indicates that the  can not be distributed in a homogeneous disk .",
    "indeed , the opacity variations from channel to channel ( figure  2 ) suggests that the  gas is not homogeneously distributed .",
    "we therefore concur with the standard schematic of clumpy atomic gas around agns ( e.g. , peck et al.@xmath01999 ) .      in this section",
    "we discuss the properties of  absorption in b2352 + 495 with respect to other  extragalactic absorbers that have been studied at very high angular resolution ( i.e. , interferometric observations with baselines @xmath107 km ; table  1 ) .",
    "as is clear from table  1 and the discussion in @xmath96 , high angular resolution observations of  in csos reveal that the absorption does not trace a specific kind of cloud , instead , the absorbing clouds appear to be in quite different locations throughout the host galaxy , from infalling high velocity clouds and giant molecular clouds at kiloparsec scales , to torus and disks closer ( @xmath108pc ) to the nucleus .",
    "only two of the five csos imaged at high angular resolution exhibit  absorption toward both radio lobes ( table  1 ; b1934@xmath25638 has not be imaged at high angular resolution , see @xmath1091.1 ) . in general",
    "( four out of six , table  1 ) , csos studied at high angular resolution are characterized by a broad ( @xmath110 100 )  absorption component , and tend to be multi - peaked , with narrow ( @xmath111 100 ) lines detected in five of six cases .",
    "high angular resolution observations of  toward non - cso radio galaxies ( table  1 ) show a similar trend as the csos counterparts , i.e. , the  absorption appears to trace a variety of environments , from disks directly associated with the agn to clouds at kiloparsec - scale distances from the active nucleus .",
    "an apparent difference is the occurrence of  clouds interacting with radio jets . in the case of several non - cso with double jet / lobe radio emission ,",
    "the  appears to trace regions of interaction between atomic gas and radio jets , whereas such an interpretation has not been preferred in any of the csos imaged in  at high angular resolution .",
    "this trend does not appear to be due to bias of the researchers but , in most cases , seems due to real differences in the samples .",
    "for instance , the  absorption associated with tori / disks in csos is found very close ( @xmath108pc ) to the radio core , close to the systemic velocity , and/or has evidence of rotation .",
    "conversely , the  in non - cso double jet / lobe sources with possible jet / cloud iteration is found at larger distances from the core ( @xmath112pc ) , shows no evidence of rotation , and/or has significantly different velocity from systemic .",
    "although a more robust statistical sample is needed to achieve strong conclusions , the apparent absence of  interaction with the radio jets supports the current view that csos are young radio galaxies instead of being confined by dense circumnuclear material as proposed in the frustration scenario .",
    "arguments for the youth scenario are mostly based on the overall radio continuum properties of the sources , power budget estimates of the jets , expansion velocities , and properties of the nuclear molecular / atomic gas .",
    "csos lack strong extended radio emission related to energy deposited by the jets over long periods , and vlbi studies reveal proper motions that imply short dynamic ages ( of the order of @xmath113yr , e.g. , gugliucci et al . 2005 ) .",
    "in addition , if the advance of the radio lobes would be truly frustrated , then for them to be in ram - pressure equilibrium the density of the surrounding medium should be above @xmath114@xmath74 . however , if the high density material is confined to a disk / torus then the frustration scenario is not viable .",
    "b2352 + 495 has evidence of being a young source based on all these arguments : it has no detected extended radio emission , the expansion velocity implies a dynamic age of @xmath30yr ( taylor et al.@xmath02000 ) , and , as discussed above , the high density atomic gas appears to be distributed along a disk or torus which does not interact with the radio jet .",
    "hence , the evidence favors the youth interpretation in this case .",
    "we report high angular resolution ( @xmath115mas ) observations of  in the cso b2352 + 495 .",
    "we detect two absorption features : a broad line almost centered at the systemic velocity of the host galaxy , and a redshifted narrow line indicating infall .",
    "both lines are seen in absorption against the radio continuum of the central radio source of the cso , which is the brightest continuum source in the region at the observed frequency .",
    "the radio continuum originates from the radio jet and not from the core .    in the case of the narrow  component",
    ", our data can not establish the location of the  cloud with respect to the agn , i.e. , the radial distance of the cloud to the galaxy center is unknown . on the other hand ,",
    "the broad component is likely tracing circumnuclear material close ( @xmath116pc ) to the agn . even though we can not constrain the scale height of the  gas ,",
    "the broad  absorption could originate from a clumpy circumnuclear disk .",
    "all available data suggest that b2352 + 495 is a young radio source and not an older source whose radio lobes have been confined by high density circumnuclear material.@xmath0hence , this work supports the study of csos as a key to understand the origin of extended radio galaxies .",
