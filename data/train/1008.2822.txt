    "we plot the fermi surfaces of la at low pressure and at high pressure shown in fig.[fig7 ] . at low pressure",
    "there is only one sheet of fermi surface with rather complex topology .",
    "the electrons occupy around the boundaries except that near the center region of eight hexagons and the 24 vertexes .",
    "when the pressure increases to 29.2 gpa , the topology of fermi surface has significant changes .",
    "a group of very small fermi - surface packets appear near the middle of @xmath100 lines but they are nt displayed in fig.[fig7 ] due to very small sizes .",
    "the occupations of electrons near regions of eight hexagons have large reductions , especially near 36 edges .",
    "this means that the electronic states at the edges of brillouin zone are electron - like states at low pressure and hole - like states at high pressure .",
    "the large reconstruction of fermi surface for la will lead to the structural transition between different phases . for metal cu , the increasing pressure only generates very small changes of lattice constant .",
    "so its electron - like fermi surface has very small change at high pressure ( 153.7 gpa ) shown in fig.[fig7 ] with the well - known shape of fermi surface at ambient pressure .",
    "the high - symmetry points of brillouin zone characterize the long - range orders of crystal structure determined by space - group symmetries .",
    "the electrons with wave vectors near high symmetrical points , line and boundaries of brillouion zone have potentially strong interactions with lattice vibrations .",
    "the main contributions to @xmath1 come from the parts of fermi surface contacted with boundaries of brillouion zone .",
    "this is why noble metals have very small @xmath1 and metal la , pb and hg have very larger @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the structural phase transition will lead to the sharp increases of @xmath1 with increasing pressure for metal la .",
    "in summary , we have calculated t@xmath0 map in the region of weak electron - phonon coupling . the threshold effect of @xmath31 is found in small @xmath1 region .",
    "it origins from the competition between electron - phonon interaction and electron - electron coulomb interaction when @xmath1 is comparable with @xmath3 .",
    "the threshold effect of @xmath1 can explain why noble metals are not superconductors even at high pressure and why t@xmath0 of most of simple metals are higher than 0.1k .",
    "the phonon spectra and eliashberg functions have been calculated by using linear response method in the framework of density functional theory .",
    "the obtained eliashberg functions @xmath5 are then used in the calculations of strong - coupling theory .",
    "our calculations illustrate how the superconducting parameters of simple metals distribute on the t@xmath0 map and how they run on the map with increasing pressure .",
    "our results explain the pressure - dependent t@xmath0 of metal li at high pressure ( @xmath9580gpa ) .",
    "thus the t@xmath0 maps studied in this paper and in previous papers  @xcite are very useful tools for studying the superconductivity of simple metals and hopefully extend to other types of superconductors .",
    "the fermi surfaces are plotted using xcrysden software .",
