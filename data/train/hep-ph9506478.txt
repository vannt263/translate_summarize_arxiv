    "<S> whatever be the mechanism for the generation of the baryon asymmetry realized by nature , its final value was determined by the @xmath0 violating processes within the standard model which are active at the epoch of the electroweak phase transition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a particularly important quantity is the rate at which @xmath0 violation proceeds in the  symmetric \" phase of the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity determines , together with the set of conserved charges , how much of any primordial @xmath0 and/or b excess survives until the universe undergoes the electroweak phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it also enters all scenarios of electroweak baryogenesis @xcite .    as a starting point for discussions of b+l violation at high temperatures </S>",
    "<S> it is customary to approximate the electroweak theory by an su(2 ) higgs model . in the broken phase </S>",

    "<S> the free energy @xmath8 of the system is evaluated by expanding in gaussian fluctuations around the sphaleron and the vacuum solutions , respectively , and @xmath9 denotes the negative eigenvalue of the unstable mode . in the symmetric phase , due to the vanishing of the vacuum expectation value and the vector boson mass , no non - trivial solution of the classical field equations </S>",
    "<S> is known , the loop expansion breaks down and a semiclassical calculation seems impossible . </S>",
    "<S> the general form of the rate may nevertheless be inferred from dimensional analysis to be @xcite [ rate ] = c  ( _ w t)^4  . the dimensionless coefficient @xmath3 was found in lattice simulations to be of order @xmath10 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , these simulations have been criticised recently @xcite and it is not clear how reliable this result for @xmath3 is . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore particularly desirable to have an independent analytical calculation of the rate in the symmetric phase .    </S>",
    "<S> a semiclassical calculation for temperatures above the critical temperature @xmath11 of the electroweak phase transition becomes possible if a transverse mass @xmath12 is generated dynamically for the spatial components of the vector field . </S>",
    "<S> such a  magnetic mass \" screens infrared singularities of the order @xmath13 , thus making a loop expansion possible . </S>",
    "<S> however , the coefficient @xmath14 of this mass is entirely non - perturbative @xcite . with a massive vector boson , </S>",
    "<S> one expects again a potential barrier between the different winding number sectors of the theory , peaked at a saddle point providing the means to use semiclassical techniques . on the other hand , the presence of a barrier leads to a boltzmann factor @xmath15 at inverse temperatures @xmath16 suppressing the rate of transitions @xcite . with a temperature dependent mass @xmath17 , </S>",
    "<S> the sphaleron energy is of the form e_s= </S>",
    "<S> 8m_0 b(/g^2)t . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the boltzmann factor is temperature independent and the strength of the supression depends exponentially on the coefficients of the vector boson mass , @xmath14 , and the sphaleron energy , @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> based on this observation a non - linear sigma model describing massive vector bosons was studied in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and the rate of sphaleron transitions was estimated as a function of the coefficient of the magnetic mass . </S>",
    "<S> the main motivation for this model was the fact that it implements the vector boson mass in a gauge invariant manner , while the higgs degrees of freedom with their thermal masses of the order @xmath19 may be viewed as decoupling heavy particles compared to the scale of interest @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the maximal rate achievable in this model was found to be @xmath20 for @xmath21 , but smaller by many orders of magnitude for other values of @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> non - perturbative effects in finite temperature field theory are related to the infrared behaviour of the corresponding three - dimensional theory . in a recent paper @xcite dynamical mass generation </S>",
    "<S> was studied in a gauge invariant manner in the three - dimensional su(2 ) higgs model . supplementing mass resummations with vertex resummations led to a set of gauge independent gap equations for the higgs boson and vector boson masses . </S>",
    "<S> for parameter values generally associated with the  symmetric \" phase , the gap equations exhibit solutions with non - vanishing vacuum expectation value and vector boson mass . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the  symmetric \" phase is again a higgs phase , just with modified parameters . in subsequent work </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a comparison of the gap equation approach as applied to the abelian and non - abelian higgs model established that the appearance of a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value and vector boson mass in the  symmetric \" phase is specific to the non - abelian model and hence not an artifact of the resummation scheme .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> i shall assume that the picture developed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite gives a reliable description of the  symmetric \" phase and explore its consequences for the sphaleron rate . </S>",
    "<S> given the structure of the resummed action , the calculation of the rate in the modified loop expansion is straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> since the resummed three - dimensional theory appears again to be in a higgs phase , all that needs to be done is to match its parameters properly to previous calculations of the rate in the broken phase @xcite-@xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> i work with the effective three - dimensional theory without fermions , following the calculation in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly convenient because in this case the results of @xcite can be used directly . as will be discussed after the presentation of this limiting case , a complete treatment including fermions and keeping the non - zero matsubara modes , analogous to that in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , should also be possible in principle .    in order to illustrate the reduction of the rate calculation in the  symmetric \" phase to the known ones in the broken phase it is necessary to briefly outline the approach of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that for high temperatures and small enough couplings the su(2 ) higgs model may be perturbatively reduced to yield an effective three - dimensional model [ s3 ] s_3 = d^3x , where the effective parameters are related to the original four - dimensional ones by @xcite [ match ] g_3 ^ 2 & = & g^2(t)t  , _ 3 = ( ( t ) - 3128 g^3(t ) + o(g^4 , ^2 ) ) t  , + ^2_3 & = & ( 316 g^2(t ) + 12(t ) -316g^3(t ) + o(g^4 , ^2 ) ) ( t^2 - t_b^2 ) . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 denotes the  barrier temperature \" , t_b=^1/2 , which coincides with the critical temperature @xmath11 for a second - order phase transition but is slightly lower than @xmath11 for a first - order phase transition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the main interest here is in temperatures well above the phase transition , this difference is immaterial in what follows . at tree level , for @xmath23 , the higgs field in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ s3 ] ) develops a vacuum expectation value @xmath24 , the system is in the higgs phase , has a sphaleron solution and the loop expansion in @xmath25 with @xmath26 is convergent . for @xmath27 , @xmath28 and a loop expansion in terms of the parameter @xmath25 is not possible . </S>",
    "<S> this situation can be remedied by rearranging the perturbation series , s_3=s_3+s_3 - s_3s_3r - s_3 , where @xmath29 contains mass and vertex corrections from higher orders in the ordinary loop expansion . in the modified expansion one - loop calculations are performed starting from @xmath30 while the terms included in @xmath31 are treated as counterterms which have to be taken into account in higher orders . calculating self - energies in this scheme leads to a coupled set of non - linear gap equations in which the physical pole masses of the vector boson ( @xmath32 ) and the higgs boson ( @xmath33 ) as well as the the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field are determined self - consistently as functions of the parameters of the theory , [ rmass ] m^2&=&f(m / m , v_3;_3/g_3 ^ 2,^2_3/g_3 ^ 4 ) + m^2&=&g(m / m , v_3;_3/g_3 ^ 2,^2_3/g_3 ^ 4 ) + </S>",
    "<S> v_3&=&h(m / m , v_3;_3/g_3 ^ 2,^2_3/g_3 ^ 4 ) , where the explicit forms of the functions @xmath34 are given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the resummed action may be written in terms of the solutions of these equations as [ lresum ] s_3r = d^3x , + with the resummed parameters [ rpar ] _ </S>",
    "<S> 3r=,^2_3r =- m^2 . from this form of the action it follows that the  symmetric \" phase is again a higgs phase , since @xmath35 is a physical mass and always positive . </S>",
    "<S> the first - order phase transition with a jump in the masses found for small values of @xmath36 changes to a smooth crossover at large @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> this reorganisation of the perturbative series assumes that the classical vacuum solution of the field equations is not the true ground state of the theory , as is also indicated by the breakdown of the loop expansion . </S>",
    "<S> instead , it perturbs around the true vacuum containing quantum interactions . correspondingly , the classical field equations have no sphaleron solution for @xmath27 , while the field equations derived from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lresum ] ) with @xmath37 do have a non - trivial solution . </S>",
    "<S> clearly the form of these field equations and their sphaleron solution is the same as that of the classical ones in the broken phase , with the replaced parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in particular </S>",
    "<S> this means that the calculation of the rate now is the same as that in the broken phase .    in order to transform the action ( [ lresum ] ) to the form used in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite coordinates and fields have to be rescaled to be dimensionless , x_i_i/ 2m , w_i2 m w_i , 2 m . using @xmath40 with @xmath41 </S>",
    "<S> then leads to [ rmcl ] s_3r = d^3 . </S>",

    "<S> , a gauge has to be fixed . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by imposing the @xmath44 background gauge condition d_i(w^b)w_i+i(^-^)=0 , with the fadeev - popov determinant _ </S>",

    "<S> however , the results of ref .  @xcite and ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite agree within 10% accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> i have therefore chosen to take the data for the contributions to @xmath45 from ref .  </S>",

    "<S> is for @xmath69 or @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> close to the phase transition @xmath3 is strongly temperature dependent , dropping exponentially as @xmath22 is approached . for temperatures higher than @xmath71 the sphaleron rate reaches its asymptotic form ( [ rate ] ) with constant c , where it is also rather insensitive to the value of the higgs mass . in this asymptotic region </S>",
    "<S> the constant coefficient takes on the value @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized that the onset of the asymptotic behaviour is a non - trivial prediction within the modified loop expansion , relying on the temperature dependence of the resummed scalar coupling as shown in fig .  2 .    </S>",
    "<S> comparing with the results obtained earlier for the non - linear sigma model @xcite one finds that keeping the higgs degree of freedom enhances the rate considerably , even though it apparently has little influence on the dynamics and the mass of the vector field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the relevant saddle point solution of the non - linear sigma model has , at the same value of @xmath14 , substantially higher energy than the sphaleron solution of the higgs model , resulting in a stronger boltzmann suppression . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the higgs degree of freedom may not be neglected in a semiclassical treatment , even though it seems to play only a marginal role dynamically .    in the case of @xmath72 , </S>",
    "<S> the actual baryon number dissipation rate is related to the sphaleron rate by @xcite _ </S>",
    "<S> b =- n_f^3 , for @xmath73 fermion generations . the temperature @xmath74 at which the sphaleron processes drop out of equilibrium may be estimated by equating the dissipation rate @xmath75 with the hubble expansion rate of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> well above the phase transition the latter is @xmath76 @xcite and one obtains t_*n_f m_pl_w^4 c~10 ^ 11gev .    </S>",
    "<S> an important question concerns the accuracy of the numerical result presented in fig .  2 . within the framework of the three - dimensional theory , </S>",
    "<S> there are essentially two sources of possible corrections . </S>",
    "<S> first , there might be higher order corrections to the masses calculated from the resummed action , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rmass ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient of the vector boson mass @xmath14 enters the prefactor exponentially so that corrections to this quantitiy are expected to alter the value of @xmath3 significantly . </S>",
    "<S> other changes , like small shifts in @xmath56 also due to mass corrections , should only have a minor impact in comparison . </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative estimate of the leading effect may be obtained by substituting @xmath77 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ resc ] ) , with @xmath78 varying between , say , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> one finds that the prefactor varies accordingly between @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively , at a fixed temperature @xmath83 . or , to put it the other way round , the result @xmath20 is stable as long as @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the order of magnitude of the coefficient @xmath3 can not be considered to be fixed until the dynamical vector boson mass is determined with sufficient accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> second , there is the question of the applicability of the langer - affleck formula ( [ langer ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the saddle point expansion is to be valid , the one - loop contribution should be small compared to the saddle point contribution . in this calculation the fluctuations make up less than @xmath85 of the saddle point energy , for all values of @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour is improved for larger vector boson mass but worse for smaller vector boson mass , which also follows from the the effective loop expansion parameter , @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , the role of fermions and non - zero matsubara modes needs to be discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the three - dimensional effective action ( [ s3 ] ) approximates the full four - dimensional one up to terms of the order @xmath87 @xcite , where @xmath7 now is a generic temperature dependent mass @xmath88 of any particle of the original theory . for fermions , scalars and the zero component of the gauge field @xmath89 , while for the spatial vector bosons @xmath90 in the  symmetric \" phase , so corrections are suppressed by powers of coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath91 is not very small and the corrections might be important numerically . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since these are corrections to the three - dimensional action which , up to a normlization , coincides with the sphaleron energy functional , their effect on the rate may be quite substantial . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the sphaleron fluctuation determinants were calculated for the four - dimensional theory at finite temperature in the broken phase , including also a doublet of fermions . </S>",
    "<S> indeed it was found that the fermion determinant enhances the sphaleron energy by about @xmath92 , leading to an additional suppression of the rate . since the scenario of </S>",
    "<S> the  symmetric \" phase discussed in this paper resembles the broken phase in several respects , a similar effect may occur here too . </S>",
    "<S> an investigation of the full four - dimensional theory should be possible in principle , albeit technically complicated . </S>",
    "<S> it would require a separation of the zero and non - zero matsubara modes which after the resummation of the zero mode sector could not be treated on the same footing anymore . </S>",
    "<S> instead , a separate diagonalization of the corresponding fluctuation operators would be necessary .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the gap equation approach suggested in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite was applied to the problem of b+l violation in the  symmetric \" phase of the standard model and found to be a useful calculational method . </S>",
    "<S> it yields the expected asymptotic behaviour of the rate as well as the temperature where this behaviour sets in , and the numerical coefficient of the rate . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the coefficient turns out to be sensitive to higher order corrections to the dynamical vector boson mass . </S>",
    "<S> given this uncertainty the numerical result obtained at one - loop level may be regarded as compatible with previous results from lattice monte - carlo simulations @xcite . in order to tighten the results obtained here the underlying picture of the  symmetric \" phase needs to be confirmed by some other non - perturbative method . </S>",
    "<S> once this is achieved , one can go on and attempt to generalize to the four - dimensional case including fermions .    </S>",
