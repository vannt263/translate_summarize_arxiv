    "the sixteenth international symposium on very high energy cosmic ray interactions has brought together high energy physicists from the domains of collider experiments and cosmic ray observatories .",
    "fermilab is a natural setting for this interaction , as it now has strong participation in both communities .",
    "the instrumentation of high energy particle physics is common to all .",
    "close cooperation and dialog between the communities is now especially timely , as data from lhc collider experiments begin to establish particle interaction properties up to higher energy , and measurements of air showers produced by ultra - high energy cosmic rays offer constraints on interactions at still higher energies .",
    "collider experiments make and measure individual collisions between particles of known energy and type .",
    "observations of cosmic ray interactions are indirect , and the energy and particle type of the incident cosmic ray must be inferred .",
    "cosmic accelerators provide an uncontrolled beam , but that cosmic beam provides access to interactions with energies far beyond what can be reached in laboratories .    in his colloquium during the conference ,",
    "dietrich mueller emphasized the two persistent questions about cosmic rays : what are these particles ? and",
    "where do they come from ? direct measurements of cosmic rays at the top of the atmosphere have established the distribution of nuclear masses at low energies .",
    "these cosmic rays are known to be of galactic origin from the abundances of radioactive nuclei , and the column density ( g/@xmath0 ) of matter which they traverse in the disk of the galaxy before escaping is determined for different energies from the relative abundance of isotopes that are produced by spallation .",
    "gev and tev gamma ray observations provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that supernovae and pulsar wind nebulae produce these cosmic rays in the galaxy , although observational proof is still lacking that those gamma rays are produced by cosmic ray interactions rather than electromagnetic processes .",
    "direct measurements of electrons and positrons ( atic and pamela ) have found excesses that have prompted widespread speculation that they could be evidence for dark matter annihilation or decay .",
    "alternatively , the overdensities relative to expectation might be due to one or more nearby sources .",
    "curious anisotropy features observed both by milagro and argo might also be evidence of cosmic ray particles from nearby sources .",
    "the answers to mueller s questions are even less clear at energies where the low flux requires indirect measurements by air showers .",
    "this includes the especially interesting region of the spectrum s knee near 3 pev .",
    "open questions remain as to what causes the knee .",
    "is it a rigidity limit of supernova shock acceleration , with the spectrum for each nuclear type breaking at an energy proportional to its charge ? does the knee result from an abrupt change in the rigidity dependence of the time needed for escape from the galaxy ? or could it be a measurement artifact stemming from an interaction energy threshold effect that would create a spectral break at a particular value of e / a rather than e / z ? is the sharpness of the knee indicative of a single prominent source ?",
    "of particular interest is the energy of transition where the low energy cosmic rays of galactic origin give way to a different population that come from extragalactic sources .",
    "a transition between two power law spectra would necessarily be concave upward in the transition region ( on a log - log plot of the spectrum ) .",
    "the only prominent upward concavity in the spectrum is at the ankle near 5 eev .",
    "( 1 eev = @xmath1 ev . )",
    "dominance by galactic cosmic rays to such high energy requires something other than supernova accelerators , i.e. the galactic `` source b '' of hillas ( cf .",
    "talk @xcite ) .",
    "another popular picture is that the ankle is a feature carved from an extragalactic proton spectrum by @xmath2 pair production , with the transition energy being somewhere below the ankle @xcite . in that case",
    ", the challenge is to find evidence for the transition in the energy spectrum or composition at some energy below the ankle .",
    "kascade grande extended upward the energy range of the kascade array for this purpose .",
    "the tale extension of the telescope array and the heat enhancement of auger are extending downward their energy ranges for this search .",
    "evidence for upward concavity just before a `` second knee '' was shown in talks by arteaga - velzquez @xcite and martirosov @xcite .",
    "see section [ below - ankle ] .",
    "ironically , the answers to mueller s questions may be easier for the extremely rare trans - gzk @xcite particles with energy above @xmath3 ev .",
    "cosmic rays can not retain such high energy for more than roughly 100 mpc due to pion photoproduction ( protons ) or nuclear photodisintegration .",
    "their sources must therefore lie within that `` gzk sphere , '' and protons can arrive from those sources with magnetic deflections of only a few degrees .",
    "also , except for heavy nuclei like iron , photodisintegration is so rapid that any contributing sources of nuclei must be within just tens of mpc .",
    "unless there are one or more strong sources very close , the composition can only be protons , heavy nuclei like iron , or some mixture of just those two types .",
    "heavy nuclei are deflected much more than protons by magnetic fields ( both galactic and extragalactic ) .",
    "compelling evidence for small deflections from candidate sources would identify the sources and also establish a population of extremely high energy protons .",
    "that leads to the next questions : how are the protons accelerated in those sources ? and what do we learn about high energy hadronic interactions from air shower development properties using that proton beam ?",
    "intriguing results from the auger observatory are suggesting some exciting results in this direction .",
    "analyses of hires data , however , do not confirm trans - gzk anisotropy , and there are differences in measured properties of air shower developments between hires and auger .",
    "there were a large number of exciting talks about experiments and observations ",
    "too many to summarize here .",
    "the written versions are available in these proceedings .",

    "@xmath6 production ratio is lower than mc tunings at 900 gev , but agreement with predictions is good at 7 tev .",
    "results from alice were reported by henner buesching @xcite .",
    "these include multiplicity distributions at 900 gev , 2.6 and 7 tev , transverse momentum distribution at 900 gev and mean p@xmath7 as a function of multiplicity , and the anti - baryon / baryon ratio at 900 gev and 7 tev .",

    "detectors built for studies of particle collisions and neutrino beams have been used also to detect cosmic ray muons .",
    "those muons are helpful in analyzing detector performance , but the measurements can also be used for cosmic ray physics .",
    "yuqian ma @xcite reported on results from the l3+c collaboration .",
    "they have measured the atmospheric muon energy spectrum , the muon charge ratio ; the moon s shadow , the anti - proton / proton ratio , and properties of muon bundles .",
    "they have not found any muon excess from candidate point sources , but they identified a hot spot as a candidate unknown source .",
    "they do not detect anisotropy in sidereal time .",
    "cms results for muon measurements were reported by gavin hesketh @xcite .",
    "measurements were made above ground and in the cavern underground .",

    "philip schreiner @xcite reported results from minos on atmospheric muons .",
    "they make careful corrections for temperature , which affects their muon detection rates .",
    "they have been able to determine several meson production rate ratios for primary cosmic rays above 7 tev : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and also @xmath11 .",
    "the direct measurements were divided according to whether or not the detectors used magnetic spectrometers .",
    "john mitchell @xcite reviewed the missions with detectors that include magnetic spectrometers .",
    "those include both missions in space as well as balloon payloads .",
    "the magnet allows charge separation for particles of the same mass and energy , so in conjunction with other detectors these can distinguish matter from anti - matter .",
    "the talk focused primarily on four different missions : ( 1 ) the two balloon flights of bess - polar ( balloon - borne experiment with a superconducting spectrometer ) , ( 2 ) pamela satellite ( payload for antimatter matter exploration and light - nuclei astrophysics ) , ( 3 ) ams ( alpha magnetic spectrometer ) , its first ride on the space station and plans for the upcoming ams-02 , ( 4 ) the future pebs ( positron electron balloon spectrometer ) .",
    "results on the energy dependence of the positron / electron ratio from pamela have attracted enormous attention due to possible explanations in terms of dark matter annihilations .",
    "the updated pamela plot is shown in figure [ pamela ] .",
    "mitchell s talk included not only a discussion of various dark matter scenarios , but also astrophysical explanations in terms of a nearby source ( supernova or pulsar ) .",
    "andrei kounine @xcite presented details about the ams mission .",
    "in particular , he explained the reason for the recent announcement that the permanent magnet used in ams-01 would be used also in ams-02 instead of the planned superconducting magnet .",
    "the hope is to collect data until 2020 or 2028 . with the superconducting magnet , the lifetime",
    "would be limited to less than 3 years by the cryogenics , without an option to refill .",
    "the detector has been reconfigured to work with the weaker field of the permanent magnet , and launch is expected in november of this year .",
    "eun - suk seo @xcite reviewed the missions that measure cosmic rays directly without a magnetic spectrometer .",
    "these include atic ( advanced thin ionization calorimeter ) , fermi gamma - ray space telescope , calet ( calorimetric electron telescope ) , crest ( cosmic ray electron - synchrotron telescope ) , tracer ( transition radiation array for cosmic energetic radiation ) , tiger ( trans - iron galactic element recorder ) , and cream ( cosmic ray energetics and mass ) .",
    "the atic collaboration reported a significant excess electron intensity near 500 gev in 2008 ( relative to model expectations ) , which , taken along with the pamela result , ignited interest in the interpretation of dark matter annihilating to a light boson .",
    "astrophysically the excess flux can be attributed to the presence of individual sources @xcite    seo emphasized results from the five flights of cream : the boron / carbon ratio up to tev / nucleon , and elemental spectra over four decades of energy .",
    "the energy spectra show a distinct hardening near 200 gev / nucleon ( figure [ cream ] ) , and a variety of explanations have been proposed to account for it .",
    "satoru takahashi @xcite presented plans for a balloon - borne gamma - ray telescope with nuclear emulsions .",
    "it is expected to have excellent angular resolution ( figure [ takahashi ] ) and polarization sensitivity .",
    "although direct measurements of cosmic rays have provided rich details about the energy spectra of individual components up to energies exceeding 100 tev , important additional information about anisotropy of those cosmic rays is coming from air shower detectors and large muon detectors . in particular ,",
    "jordan goodman @xcite summarized anisotropy results from milagro , icecube , argo , and the tibet air shower array that show a consistent large scale anisotropy pattern .",
    "figure [ goodman - a ] shows a full - sky anisotropy map using icecube ( muon ) data for the southern sky and milagro cosmic ray data for the north .        a one - dimensional plot of the intensity variation with right ascension is shown in figure [ goodman - b ] for a strip of declinations between 10@xmath12 and 20@xmath12 .",
    "the large - scale variation with right ascension is statistically unquestionable .",
    "the amplitude ( @xmath13 is less than the compton - getting @xcite effect ( @xmath14 ) which would be expected if our motion relative to the cosmic rays were that of our motion relative to the cmb , and the dipole component is not in the direction of that motion . it is interesting that milagro has measured a modest time dependence of the anisotropy that is not confirmed by tibet as .",
    "figure [ goodman - b ] shows a narrow feature marked as `` region a '' in that declination strip .",
    "it is seen , along with `` region b '' in figure [ goodman - c ] , where the same narrow features are clear also in the argo data .",
    "these features are due to cosmic rays , not gamma rays , in the milagro data , and it is a fascinating open question how charged particles with such small larmor orbits in the galactic magnetic field can produce these narrow features on the sky .",
    "results above the knee of the spectrum were reported from kascade - grande by j.c .",
    "arteaga - velzquez @xcite .",
    "inferences about the composition based on separate measurements of muons and electromagnetic particles have dependence on which hadronic interaction model is used ( qgsjet or sibyll ) .",
    "the all - particle spectrum can not be fit by a simple power law above the knee .",
    "figure [ arteaga ] shows a region of upward concavity followed by a steepening that might be interpreted as an `` iron knee . ''",
    "the upward concavity was not proposed as a transition to extragalactic cosmic rays . like the spectral hardening seen at lower energy by cream , favored interpretations are shock broadening by the accelerating particles themselves @xcite or the effect of a nearby source .",
    "the kascade collaboration is pursuing multiple avenues for determining the elemental composition of the cosmic rays .",
    "one particularly interesting approach is muon tracking , as presented by paul doll @xcite .",
    "the idea is to use the muon arrival directions to determine the heights of muon production and the muon pseudorapidity distribution .    as reported by romen",
    "martirosov @xcite , the gamma experiment on mt .",
    "aragats has also found an upward concavity followed by a steepening of the energy spectrum just below @xmath15 ev .",
    "the bump , shown in figure [ martirosov ] may be consistent with the kascade features of figure [ arteaga ] .",
    "icetop is an air shower array built directly above the icecube observatory at the south pole , with a pair of ice cherenkov tanks deployed above each icecube string .",
    "serap tilav @xcite presented the status of the array as icecube nears the end of its construction .",
    "the high elevation is favorable for detecting air showers near maximum development with an energy threshold near 100 tev , and the ability to study high energy muon bundles with icecube will be a powerful tool for analyzing the composition in the region of the knee .",
    "the build - up of snow on older detectors affects the trigger rate and signal levels and must be considered in the analysis .",
    "a raw energy distribution shows the spectral steepening at the knee .",
    "sunil gupta @xcite presented results from the grapes-3 detector at ooty .",
    "it also has a low energy threshold and can compare its composition analyses based on air showers against direct measurements .",
    "they have measured their angular resolution using the shadow of the moon .",
    "they have studied in detail the trigger rate dependence on atmospheric pressure and temperature .",
    "in addition , the rates respond to space weather , and they track the effects of coronal mass ejections .",
    "a presentation by jing huang @xcite for the tibet air shower @xmath16 collaboration was given by yuqian ma .",
    "the results focused on the spectrum and composition at the knee .",
    "the tibet results indicate that the knee is produced by nuclei heavier than helium , as they dominate the lightest elements by that energy . beyond the knee",
    "the composition is expected to be heavy . to check these results in detail",
    ", they plan to construct , in three stages , the yac : yangbajing air shower core array .",
    "its goal is to study spectra of individual components at the knee .",
    "yac - i is already operational , and some early results were shown .",
    "the study of the highest energy cosmic rays is challenged by the extremely small flux of particles .",
    "the auger observatory in argentina runs continuously with an aperture of 7000 km@xmath17sr . despite that large size",
    ", the results on anisotropy and composition are limited primarily by inadequate statistics .",
    "paolo privitera described plans for auger north , which would operate with 47,000 km@xmath17sr , increasing the aperture by almost a factor of eight , while retaining good control of systematics with hybrid detections at night and careful atmospheric monitoring .",
    "jim adams @xcite presented plans for jem - euso , a space - based air fluorescence telescope to be flown on the international space station .",
    "expected to launch in 2015 , it will have an enormous aperture by virtue of a wide field of view ( 60@xmath18 ) and its large distance from the air showers .",
    "its duty cycle is limited by sunlight , moonlight , high clouds , and city lights .",
    "its energy threshold will be approximately 70 eev , roughly the energy above which auger has reported cosmic ray anisotropy .",
    "it will have full sky coverage , and it is expected to distinguish neutrinos , gamma rays , and hadronic cosmic rays .",
    "chris williams @xcite spoke about midas , an experimental study of the feasibility of observing air shower longitudinal developments day and night by using molecular bremsstrahlung radiation instead of air fluorescence .",
    "overcoming the limited duty cycle of air fluorescence telescopes would be a major advance for the study of ultra - high energy cosmic rays .",
    "fred kuehn @xcite reported on the status of the airfly measurements of the air fluorescence yield .",
    "that yield is an important normalizing constant for air fluorescence detectors that is the basis of the energy scale for ultra - high energy cosmic ray observatories .",
    "relative yield dependence on atmospheric pressure , temperature , and humidity , on photon wavelength and electron energy have all been published already . a final result for the absolute yield",
    "is expected by the end of 2010 with uncertainty less than 5% .",
    "masaki fukushima @xcite presented preliminary results obtained with the telescope array in utah , including a hybrid energy spectrum and composition analysis using stereoscopic measurements .",
    "the results are consistent with published hires results . in particular , the mean depths of maximum @xmath19 in three energy bins below and above 10 eev are at least as deep as expected for protons using conventional air shower models .",
    "of special interest is an upcoming end - to - end calibration of their fluorescence detector using a linac to accelerate electrons in an upward - going beam at a distance of 100 meters from a ta telescope .",
    "tale is a proposed low - energy extension of the ta which would permit air fluorescence measurements of cosmic ray shower longitudinal profiles down to energies below 100 pev .",
    "charlie jui @xcite presented plans for 15 additional telescopes to cover an elevation angle range from @xmath20 to @xmath21 over a @xmath22 azimuthal range . at those lower energies , air showers",
    "can only be measured relatively nearby , and the depth of maximum is therefore viewed at a high elevation angle .",
    "pierre sokolsky @xcite reported `` final results from the high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) experiment . ''",
    "those results include the stereo energy spectrum , anisotropy , and composition analysis .",
    "the energy spectrum was shown to agree well with the auger energy spectrum by a shift of energies commensurate with the combined systematic uncertainty of the two observatories .",
    "no significant anisotropy is found - not the clustering reported by agasa , not the agn correlation reported by auger , not any detected correlation with nearby large scale structure represented in the 2mrs catalog , and no confirmation of a tentative hires correlation with bl lacs reported earlier .",
    "the hires analysis of depths of maximum is shown in figure [ hires_xmax ] .",
    "the results are consistent with simulations of proton - initiated air showers .    .",
    "the upper plot shows the mean @xmath19 as a function of energy .",

    "the data are compared with expectations from customary models for protons and for iron.,width=226 ]    paolo privitera @xcite presented results from the pierre auger observatory .",
    "the energy spectrum shows a clear steepening at the energy expected for the gzk pion photoproduction by protons or photodisintegration of iron .",
    "the structure is very similar to the hires spectrum , differing only by about a 20% shift in energy .",
    "the status of the correlation of arrival directions above 55 eev with agn locations was updated with new data .",
    "the correlation has decreased from roughly 70% to 40% .",
    "however , the 2.5@xmath23 statistical significance of the deviation from the 21% isotropic expectation is the same as when the correlation was first reported in 2007 .",
    "figure [ auger_corr ] shows the history and present status of the agn correlation .",
    "the auger @xmath19 results appear different from those of hires , as can be seen by comparing figure [ auger_xmax ] with figure [ hires_xmax ] .",
    "the left plot shows the mean @xmath19 as a function of energy , and the right plot shows the width of the @xmath19 distribution for each energy bin.,width=302 ]    of special interest is the trend toward narrow @xmath19 distributions in the decade from 4 to 40 eev .",
    "using customary extrapolations of hadronic models to these energies , the narrow distribution near 20 eev is not consistent with a mixture of heavy nuclei and protons , and it is significantly narrower than expected for a pure proton composition .",
    "it is suggestive of a purely heavy composition and , in view of the magnetic field of the galaxy , not easily reconciled with the correlation of arrival directions with agns at somewhat higher energy .",
    "if the narrow distribution is assumed to be protons at the next - to - highest energy bin , for example , a conservative minimum proton - air cross section is obtained by assuming that the spread in @xmath19 is entirely due to the spread in first interaction depths .",
    "figure [ auger_xsection ] shows this lower limit in relation to some standard models of how the proton - air cross section may rise with energy .",
    "values near 20 eev _ if the primary particles are protons_. the dotted circle is the upper limit obtained from the `` 1-sigma '' upper limit on that @xmath19 distribution width.,width=302 ]",
    "accelerator experiments and cosmic ray observations are two arenas of high energy physics that have been intertwined since particle accelerators came into existence in the second half of the last century .",
    "the high energy frontier always belongs to cosmic rays , but measurements with controlled conditions belong to the accelerators .",
    "indirect ( air shower ) studies of cosmic rays rely on models of particle interactions , and presently the models extrapolate interaction properties to energies which have not been investigated experimentally . for example , different extrapolations result in different composition inferences near the knee using kascade data .",
    "it is therefore exciting that detectors like totem , lhcf , and castor will be providing data in the essential forward region .",
    "the center of mass interaction energy is now 7 tev and will increase to 14 tev .",
    "as seen in figure [ auger_xsection ] , a measured cross section at the lhc energy will be a powerful constraint on extrapolations to the regime of ultra - high energy cosmic rays .",
    "air shower simulations also require accurate modeling of secondary interactions .",
    "the mipp measurements , with its variety of beam particles and nuclear targets and with its measurements over all of phase space , will provide vital data for this .",
    "cosmic ray observations are now rich in details over the entire energy spectrum of ten decades .",
