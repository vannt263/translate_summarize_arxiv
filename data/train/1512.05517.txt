    "the nature of the transition to large - scale clustered states in bounded _",
    "neutral _ vortex systems remains an open problem and fundamental questions remain unanswered : what is the exact transition temperature , and the universality class of the transition ?",
    "what is the precise mechanism of cluster formation ?",
    "a rigorous theory capable of addressing these questions may expand our knowledge of critical phenomena  @xcite and pattern formation  @xcite , and lead to a deeper understanding of collective vortex states in a broad class of 2d systems  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we develop an analytical treatment within mean field theory  @xcite of the clustering transition in a neutral point - vortex model confined to a uniform disc geometry .",
    "the theory provides a systematic description of the negative temperature phenomena in terms of inverse temperature @xmath2 , a function of the system energy @xmath3 parametrizing microcanonical states .",
    "we analytically find @xmath4 at which a clustering transition occurs , whereby large - scale aggregation of like - sign vortices can occur , breaking the underlying symmetries of the system .",
    "our mean field analysis gives analytical expressions for the structure of the clustered phase and critical behavior of the macroscopic dipole moment that serves as a global order parameter .",
    "in contrast to conventional second - order phase transitions linked to a local order parameter , the vortex clustering transition thus develops via the emergence of global order characterized by a non - zero macroscopic dipole moment . at high energy",
    "the system enters the supercondensation limit at @xmath5  @xcite , involving point - like concentration of vortices with the same circulation , and divergence of the system energy .",
    "the supercondensation does not break any symmetry ( it occurs within the symmetry broken phase ) and is an end point of a continuous process as energy increases .",
    "we test the microcanonical theory against monte carlo ( mc ) sampling of the microcanonical ensemble for finite vortex numbers , and find good agreement even for a modest system containing a total of @xmath6 vortices . to probe the role of finite vortex number further , we compute the energy dependence of the macroscopic dipole moment , for a range of @xmath7 from 50 to 1000 . the critical exponent determining the order parameter scaling emerges clearly even for @xmath6 vortices .",
    "as a measure of motion , absolute temperature is always positive . however under certain conditions , negative temperature states can occur for an almost isolated subsystem .",
    "the concept of temperature is applicable to such a subsystem if it is in a long - lived metastable state . since the coordinates @xmath8 of a vortex are conjugate variables ,",
    "the crucial feature of 2d point - vortex systems in a bounded domain is that the phase space volume is finite .",
    "let the phase space volume be @xmath9 for a given energy @xmath3 , then the thermodynamic entropy is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "for the extreme situation in which all the vortex dipoles ( vortex - antivortex pairs ) collapse , we then have @xmath12 .",
    "the opposite limit occurs when all the like - sign vortices concentrate into a point , in which case @xmath13 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath14 must reach its maximum at an intermediate energy @xmath15 .",
    "then the inverse temperature @xmath16 is thus negative for @xmath17 .",
    "high energy equilibrium vortex states at negative temperature correspond to large - scale clusters  @xcite .",
    "negative temperature states can arise in systems with finite and discrete degrees of freedom , for instance localized spin systems  @xcite .",
    "recently such negative temperature states have been realized for motional degrees of freedom  @xcite , where the finite band width sets an upper bound for the energy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "an interesting scenario for potential realization of onsager vortex states may occur in planar bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) . in atomic becs",
    "the point - vortex model provides an excellent description of vortex dynamics in a hydrodynamic regime  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , experimental observations of small - scale clustering  @xcite , and gross - pitaevskii simulations demonstrating clustering in forced  @xcite and decaying @xcite homogeneous systems , in harmonic traps  @xcite , and disc geometries  @xcite have raised the prospect that large - scale clustered states may be realized , amid increasing theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite interest .",
    "the scenario of negative temperature vortex states within a low positive temperature superfluid may appear implausible as the superfluid in a bec is compressible and the vortex - sound coupling must be taken into account . in general , vortex - sound coupling can play an important role in a compressible superfluid  @xcite , however , there are also regimes where the acoustic loss rate can be much slower than the dynamical timescales of vortex evolution .",
    "several theoretical works have considered the viability of negative temperature vortex states using the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe )  @xcite .",
    "they show that the compressibility of the quantum fluid does not prevent the clustering of like - sign vortices , and moreover it can even provide a mechanism to drive clustering , via an evaporative heating process  @xcite , whereby annihilations of low - energy vortex - antivortex pairs  heat up \" the remaining vortices and the end state shows a clustered configuration of like - sign vortices . experimental observations",
    "that like - sign vortices can aggregate into long - lived multiply charged structures provides further evidence that such a regime may be accessible  @xcite .",
    "these experiments can be seen as first steps towards realizing large - scale , negative temperature , clustered states of quantum vortices .",
    "several works have considered the possibility of an inverse energy cascade in two - dimensional bec , suggesting that the compressibility of the fluid may be fatal for large - scale clustering , instead causing transport of energy to small scales driven by vortex dipole annihilation  @xcite .",
    "however , these works considered specific scenarios that immediately prohibited clustering , due to either starting from initial conditions dominated by acoustic energy  @xcite , or evolving the system according to an over - damped equation of motion  @xcite .",
    "as shown in a systematic study of energy transport  @xcite , a clear regime exists where energy is transported to large scales via a vortex clustering process .",
    "the regime is one of weak dissipation , and large vortex number .",
    "recent analytical calculations further support the possibility that the sound - vortex interaction is not strong enough to prevent energy transport to large scales  @xcite , consistent with gpe simulations  @xcite .    in summary , although the temperature of the bulk liquid is always positive , rendering the negative temperature states ultimately unstable , if the temperature of a bec is low enough and the mean distance between vortices is much larger than the healing length , the clustered phase is expected to be long - lived . indeed , gpe simulations indicate that a regime exists where a separation of timescales allows clustered states to be long - lived .",
    "the cause of this timescale separation appears to have two sources : ( i ) the vortex - antivortex recombination rate is rather slow in 2d ( stemming from weak coupling to the sound field ; this weak coupling also holds for single vortices ) , ( ii ) clustering of same sign vortices suppresses close approaches of vortices and antivortices .",
    "thus , in a long time window , a system of 2d quantum vortices may evolve as an almost isolated subsystem of a confined bec at sufficiently low temperature .",
    "such quasi - equilibrium states may also have connections with non - thermal fixed point behavior  @xcite . while much evidence points to a weak coupling regime ,",
    "a detailed microscopic picture of the mechanism remains an open problem and such states have yet to be observed in the laboratory , posing a exciting future challenge for both theoretical and experimental work .",
    "we consider a total of @xmath7 quantum vortices in a planar superfluid , with core size determined by the healing length @xmath18 . in a bec at sufficiently low temperature , coupling to",
    "the thermal cloud is negligible , and provided that the average distance between vortices greatly exceeds the healing length , vortices are only weakly coupled to phonon modes .",
    "the point - vortex model then applies , and the other degrees of freedom can be neglected . in this regime the point - vortex model can also be rigorously obtained from the gpe  @xcite and the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum of quantum vortices in the gpe is well approximated by the point - vortex energy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "let us now consider @xmath19 quantum vortices consisting of @xmath20 vortices and @xmath21 anti - vortices confined to a uniform disc with radius @xmath22 , by a hard - wall boundary .",
    "hereafter we set @xmath23 , giving the point - vortex hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the circulation of a vortex at position @xmath26 .",

    "and @xmath27 is the position of the @xmath28th image vortex .",

    "depends on the shape of the domain and is absent for an unbounded domain .",
    "the disc geometry is chosen not only because it can be realized in current bec experiments  @xcite but also the simple form of the domain leads to the possibility of an exact analytical treatment . in general the point - vortex model",
