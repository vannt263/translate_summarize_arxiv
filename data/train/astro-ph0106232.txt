    "mr 2251 - 178 at redshift @xmath1=0.064 was the first quasar initially discovered by x - ray observations ( ricker et al . 1978 ) , and the first one found to host an ionized absorber ( halpern 1984 ) .",
    "the quasar turned out to be outstanding in many respects .",
    "it has a high ratio of @xmath2 , is surrounded by the largest quasar emission line nebula known , and is located in the outskirts of a cluster of galaxies ( e.g. , bergeron et al .",
    "our analysis of the _ rosat _ pspc observations of this source and its environment revealed a number of surprises , summarized below .",
    "results presented here are based on the analysis of two _ rosat _ pspc observations of mr2251 - 178 , carried out in nov .",
    "1990 ( all - sky survey ) and nov .",
    "1993 ( 18.3 ksec duration ) .",
    "details of the data analysis and the discussion of results is presented by komossa ( 2001 ) .",
    "the following results were obtained :      there is evidence for an x - ray flaring event with variability by a factor @xmath32 within 10 ksec during the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ; rarely observed in such a luminous source , but similar to pds456 ( reeves et al . 2000 ) and pks0558 - 504 ( wang et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the source was a factor @xmath33 brighter during the later pointed _",
    "rosat _ observation .",
    "the mean observed soft x - ray luminosity at that epoch , @xmath4 erg / s , places the quasar among the most x - ray luminous agn in the local universe .",
    "remarkably , we do not detect any excess x - ray _ cold _ absorption expected to originate from the giant [ oiii ] gas nebula surrounding mr2251 - 178 .",
    "this finding excludes the presence of a huge hi extent of the hii emission line gas ( along the line - of - sight ) , and constrains some formation scenarios ( e.g. , shopbell et al .",
    "2000 ) of the gas nebula .",
    "on the other hand , we do find that the x - ray spectrum is modified by lots of amounts of gas along the line of sight - but this material is _",
    "highly ionized_. as indicated by some , but not all , earlier x - ray observations of mr2251 - 178 , a single powerlaw does not provide an acceptable spectral fit ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the presence of an _ ionized absorber _ markedly improves the fit .",
    "we find an ionization parameter @xmath6 and a column density @xmath7 of the ionized material ( see komossa 1999 for a general review on warm absorbers ) . the presence of highly ionized material along the line of sight is consistent with the detection of absorption lines in the uv spectrum of mr2251 - 178 ( monier et al . 2001 ) .",
    "our best - fit warm - absorber model still leaves some residuals at the low - energy part of the spectrum , suggesting the presence of a very soft excess .",
    "none of the other optically bright member galaxies of the cluster to which mr2251 - 178 belongs , are detected in x - rays .",
    "however , east of the quasar there is a significant excess of x - ray sources ( a factor of 4 compared to the log n ",
    "log s distribution of hasinger et al .",
    "1994 ) , several of them without optical counterparts on the uk schmidt plates .",
    "the x - ray emission from the intra - cluster medium is weak or absent .",
    "we derive an upper limit on the x - ray luminosity of @xmath8 erg / s from the direction of the optical center of the cluster , weaker than other clusters of comparable richness .",
    "this may indicate that what appears as one single cluster could be just a chance projection of several poorer clusters or groups .",
    "alternatively , the cluster x - ray emission might be off - set from the optical center ."
