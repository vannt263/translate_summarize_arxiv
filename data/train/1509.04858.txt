    "in the early 1996s , grover search algorithm ( ga ) has attracted much interest , since it could work in quantum computer . the quantum search , from computational point of view ,",
    "is proved to get approximately @xmath0 operations ( in comparison with the @xmath1 classical operations ) , which indicates a quadratic speedup @xcite .",
    "many efforts have been devoted to achievement of this algorithm theoretically and experimentally by using superconducting qubits @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , atom cavity qed systems @xcite and nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite . also , most previous studies for improving the quantum ga were general and do not depend on a physical system .",
    "further , all previous implementations of quantum ga have been developed depending on grover visualizations , where the control phase parameter for the controlled phase gates or oracle is switched to @xmath2 or @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , an interesting work by long et al @xcite has replaced the grover s arbitrary phase by @xmath4 .",
    "the combination of strong resonant interactions with tight subwavelength traps gives an excellent opportunity to implement much faster quantum gates .",
    "however , there is no way to achieve single site addressability in those systems .",
    "existing proposals circumventing this problem @xcite do not consider an arbitrary controlled phase parameter or dispassion effect , as the interaction need not to be restricted by certain values of the phase control .",
    "+ in this article , we propose to add new factors allowing for significant speedup . by combining a multi - qubit system with dissipation taking into account an arbitrary phase control",
    ", we can achieve a fast search in a realistic setting .",
    "we assume that the control phase is time - dependent to realize the dynamical quantum controlled phase gates .",
    "it is shown that the involved time is the crucial factor for controlling and searching of any marked state regardless the number of qubits .",
    "consequently , we define a new algorithm called a dynamical quantum search algorithm ( dqsa ) . the proposed algorithm is a generalization of grover algorithm and ( i ) gives a higher probability of finding any marked state in shorter time , ( ii ) there is no restriction on the controlled phase parameter and ( iii ) the presence of qubits dissipation is allowed .",
    "the effect of a thermal bath has been used to improve the performance of a quantum adiabatic search algorithm @xcite .",
    "vega et al @xcite compared the effects of the field dissipation on the algorithm performance with those of a structured environment similar to the one encountered in systems coupled to an electromagnetic field that exists within a photonic crystal .",
    "they show that , the algorithm performance has been improved by tuning the environment parameters to certain regimes @xcite .",
    "we consider the problem with a different perspective , where the algorithm may be implemented within a system taking into account the qubit dissipation .        here , we consider a dense multi - qubit system sample interacting with a single surface plasmon injected from outside . in this case",
    ", we consider all the possible interactions between any arbitrary pair or more inside the sample ( see fig.[ff-1 ] ) .",
    "the direct contact between the qubits and the plasmone surface yields dissipation effects . as a consequence ,",
    "we assume that the dipole - dipole interaction potential is nonidentical for all qubits . other appropriate systems could be superconducting qubits @xcite or double quantum dot excitonic systems @xcite .",
    "such a model can be written as follows @xmath5 where @xmath6 refer to the labels of the qubits , @xmath7 is the number of qubits , @xmath8 are the dissipation rates of different qubits , @xmath9 , ... , @xmath10 are the energies biases , @xmath11 is the coupling constant and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , ... , @xmath15 are the interaction energies between two qubits or more . in the proposed model ,",
    "the interaction energy between qubits is set to provide the maximum ferromagnetic coupling . here",
    ", we consider the number of qubits is @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "to realize the dynamics of the controlled phase gates for different qubits , we write , for simplicity , that the sub - indexes @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and so on .",
    "+ first , we use the case of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "hence , the time evolution of system ( [ z1 ] ) in these cases is given by @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , we can realize a two - qubit dynamical controlled phase gates in the presence of qubits dissipation in the following context .    * if @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we get @xmath29 and @xmath30 . * if @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , we obtain @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",

    "hence , after applying these steps , the time evolution of system ( [ z1 ] ) is given by @xmath45 .",

    "+ using the same technique , one realizes the dynamical controlled phase gates in the presence of the dissipation for the case of @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "the calculations of the dynamics gates when @xmath156 and @xmath157 lengthy and are not presented here .",
    "but we present some results of application of these dynamic controlled phase gates for different qubits in calculating the probabilities of marked and un - marked states in the presence of dissipation , see appendix . if @xmath158 , one obtains the ideal dynamical controlled phase gates .",
    "the dynamical conditional phase gates for @xmath7 qubits is governed by a dynamical control parameter phase @xmath159 the parameter @xmath160 for different qubits is given by : @xmath161 + for an individual qubit and based on the available experimental data as given in @xcite , we assume that the value of @xmath162 @xmath163 to realize one qubit gate in the presence of dissipation .",
    "now , one can realize a one - qubit gate @xmath164 in the following context .",
    "the time evolution of system under @xmath165 is given by @xmath166 , and the time evolution of system under @xmath167 is given by @xmath168 .",
    "then , it is concluded that @xmath169 with @xmath170 .",
    "+ the current algorithm has two registers , the @xmath7 qubits in the first register and one qubit in the second register .",
    "therefore , the proposed system contains @xmath171 qubits .",
    "initialize an @xmath171 qubits system to the state @xmath172 @xmath173 , where the state in the second register refers to the excited state of an auxiliary working qubit .",
    "now , we implement the dynamical quantum search algorithm in the presence of dissipation as follows : performing @xmath174 on the first register and performing @xmath175 on the second register",
    ". then , we apply the dynamical controlled phase gates @xmath176 on the first register ( where @xmath177 and @xmath178,@xmath179,@xmath180 , ... ,",
    "@xmath181,@xmath182 ) and apply @xmath183 on the second register .",
    "consequently , it is to observe the state of @xmath184 which has been stored in the data qubits before applying the dynamical controlled phase gates or oracles .",
    "also , we note that after applying this step the dynamical controlled phase gates have effects only on the states to be searched in the first register and the state of the second register does not change .",
    "so , we can omit the auxiliary working qubit or one can discard the state of the second register at this point via normalization of this state .",
    "finally , we apply a new dynamical diffusion transform matrix , @xmath185 , on the first register and measure the resulting state .",
    "consequently , the final formula of the dissipation dqsa is given by : @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the number of iterations . in the absence of dissipation ,",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath188 at any time , are @xmath189 for @xmath190 @xmath191 while all diagonal elements @xmath192 are equal . also , in the presence of qubits dissipation rates , whether similar or different values , the matrix elements at any time are @xmath189 for @xmath190 while all diagonal elements @xmath192 are often close to each others .",
    "+ now , we give the probabilities definitions of finding any marked state @xmath193 and finding unmarked states ( or remaining states ) @xmath194 .",
    "the probabilities are exactly calculated in the presence of different values of dissipation rates and different @xmath7 , where both of @xmath195 and @xmath196 are one subset of the set @xmath184 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath193 and @xmath194 are give by : @xmath197 @xmath198 where @xmath199 .",
    "from eq.[k2 ] , in calculating the probabilities of unmarked states , it should be noted that at least one of @xmath196 is not equal to one of @xmath195 for the same qubit .",
    "here , we write , for simplicity , that the sub - indexes in the marked state @xmath200 and un - marked states ( @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath203 @xmath204 pr .",
    "r. s. ) ; marked state @xmath205 and unmarked states ( @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 , @xmath212 @xmath204 pr .",
    "r. s. ) ; and so on for all states of the @xmath213qubit .",
    "also , @xmath214 and so on .",
    "in table ( [ ff1 ] ) , we compare our proposed algorithm ( oa ) results with grover algorithm s results .",
    "it is shown that the probability reach @xmath215 for the two - qubit case , in both : our case and ga case , but the time needed in our case , @xmath216 is shorter than the grover time , @xmath217 ( say , @xmath218 and @xmath219 ) .",
    "this means that the efficiency of our algorithm is higher than the efficiency of ga .",
    "once we increase the number of involved qubits , we see that a significant difference between oa and ga , is seen .",
    "the probability of finding any marked state using 3 qubits , 4 qubits and 5 qubits in oa is @xmath215 while the corresponding case using ga does not exceed @xmath220 for 3 qubits , @xmath221 for 4 qubits and @xmath222 for 5 qubits .",
    "moreover , the times needed of finding any marked state are shorter than grover times .",
    "this is an interesting advantage of the proposed algorithm since the sensitivity is much higher than the grover sensitivity to the number of qubits .",
    "also , we can say that using oa , exact observation is clearly obtained even whether the number of involved qubits gets higher ( say 5 ) and one still have @xmath215 probability of finding any marked states .",
    "when we consider the number of qubits is greater than or equal 6 , it is shown that the same probability of finding any marked state is obtained using oa and ga , but the time needed to obtain such probability is shorter in our case , which is still gives oa an advantage .",
    "it is interesting to observe here that as the number of qubits is increased the probability find any desired state still coincide using oa while in grover case there does not coincide , where from @xmath223 qubits the results do not coincide with the fact that increasing the number of qubits leads to decreasing the probability .",
    "moreover , as the number is increased further , ga shows the logic behavior . in these calculations",
    ", we expect that our results ( times and probabilities ) are almost the same as ga for the large number of qubits ( say , @xmath224 ) .",
    "the reason of such agreement between our results and grover results is that when @xmath7 is increased the time for finding the highest probability of any marked state is increased to reach almost @xmath225 for finding the probability of any marked state when @xmath226 .",
    "after that , one obtains the highest probability for finding any desired states for the different qubits at times @xmath227 , this case is compatible with grover case .",
    "this observation shows that using the dynamical quantum search algorithm has some advantage , where ga is obtained as a special case from the proposed general algorithm .",
    "+ in fig.[ff2 ] we plot the probabilities of finding any marked or unmarked states as a function of dynamical phase @xmath228 , in the absence of dissipation .",
    "it is shown that for 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 qubits , see fig.[ff2]a and fig.[ff2]b , the probabilities of marked states reach one at several points rather than grover observation , where ga shows the maximum probability at @xmath229 only . in 3 qubits and 4 qubits cases ,",
    "we find that the behavior of curves peaks are between the two maxima there is a local minimum . while 2 and 5 qubits cases the maximum stays longer as a function of the phase , which means that the long lived maximum probability is obtained for 2 and 5 qubits compared with 3 and 4 qubits cases where the maximum stays for a short period .",
    "this observation is no longer existing once the number of qubits is increased ( say @xmath230 ) , where the maxima probability always less than one , see fig.[ff2]c and fig.[ff2]d .",
    "also , the unmarked states are observed for the low number of qubits and reach the maximum of @xmath231 for 2 qubits case , while this value is decreased once the number of qubits is increased .",
    "this phenomenon becomes more pronounced once the number of qubits exceeds @xmath232 after this number of qubits the probabilities are very close to zero . from our further calculations ( which are not presented here ) , the probabilities of unmarked states vanish completely when the number of qubits is greater than 20 qubits .",
    "+          +          +              + in fig.[ff3 ] , we display the behavior of the dynamical search of the probabilities of marked states @xmath233 and @xmath234 with the same dissipation rates . in the absence of dissipation , see fig.[ff2]b and table ( [ ff1 ] ) , the probabilities of the current marked states or any other marked states at times @xmath235 for 4 qubits and @xmath236 for 5 qubits are @xmath215 and the probabilities of un - marked states are zero . it is shown that when times are decreased from these values , the probabilities values of finding any marked states are less than @xmath215 and decrease more and more according to the decreasing times . with",
    "these time decreases , the probabilities of finding any marked states are decreased and this decreasing is added to the un - marked states probabilities .",
    "this means that the revivals for the probabilities of un - marked states when the time is decreased more and more to become larger when the time is close to zero .",
    "however , when the time reaches zero , the probabilities of any marked or un - marked states are @xmath237 and @xmath238 for 4 and 5 qubits , respectively .",
    "this means that both marked and un - marked states have the same chance to contribute . in the presence of weak dissipation rate",
    ", one sees that the probabilities of current marked states in fig.[ff3]a and fig.[ff3]b or any other marked states at different values of the time are gradually decreased .",
    "the probabilities values of any desired state for any number of @xmath7 at a weak values of similar dissipation are often close to each others . if the dissipation value is taken to be @xmath239 @xmath240 , the probabilities values of any desired state are sometimes increased or decreased to each other and one can not distinguish between the probability of any marked and un - marked states at any time .",
    "however , it is difficult to observe the probability of any marked state for any qubit at large dissipation rates , where small values of the probability of marked state is shown .",
    "which means that both marked and un - marked states have the same chance to contribute . + also , we display the behavior of the probabilities of current marked states in fig.[ff3]c and fig.[ff3]d for different values of qubits dissipation rates with time @xmath241 for 4 qubits and @xmath242 for 5 qubits . in the absence of dissipation",
    "the probabilities of any marked state for 4 qubits and 5 qubits at these values of times start from 0.8332 and from 1 , respectively .",
    "when a weak value of qubits - dissipation is considered , one finds that the probabilities of the current states in fig.[ff3]c and fig.[ff3]d and any other marked states for 4 and 5 qubits are gradually decreased .",
    "the values of any desired states for 4 and 5 qubits in weak dissipation are often close to each other .",
    "it is shown that for strong dissipation , the probabilities of any marked states for 4 and 5 qubits are decreased further , while one can not distinguish between different probabilities of some un - marked states .",
    "it is interesting to mention here that the observation of any desired state will be more difficult when dissipation rate is equal to @xmath243 for 4 qubits and @xmath244 for 5 qubits or more than that , where there is some probabilities of un - marked states are larger than marked state .",
    "this means that both marked and un - marked states have the same chance to contribute .",
    "+ however , the behavior of the probability of finding any remaining marked state for any different number of @xmath7 in the dissipation presence , is similar to the previous behavior , see fig.[f1 ] .",
    "it is shown that , the time is a main factor in the appearance of different probabilities of marked states using different number of qubits . therefore , the probabilities for the remaining marked states ( 3 states for 2 qubits , 7 states for 3 qubits , 14 states for 4 qubits , 29 states for 5 qubits and 63 states for 6 qubits ) have the same behavior as in the figures displayed in the above . in fig.[f2 ] , we plot dqsa for the probabilities @xmath245 and @xmath246 when the dissipation rates is considered .",
    "it is shown that the probabilities @xmath246 and @xmath245 are gradually decreased once dissipation rate takes small values , and the values of @xmath245 are less than the values of @xmath246 at any time .",
    "also , one observes that the probability @xmath246 is shown as larger values compared with the probability @xmath245 which shows small values once dissipation rate @xmath247 is increased .",
    "therefore , we can distinguish the probability @xmath248 for multi qubits at any time once dissipation rate is decreased or increased ( or varied ) .",
    "+ now , we give a short discussion to observe un - marked states in the presence of dissipation rates either similar or different .",
    "the probabilities of un - desired states for weak dissipation are distinguished by a very small values and non - zero compared with the absence of dissipation . while for strong dissipation",
    ", the probability of the desired state is becoming less and is decreased due to the influence of strong dissipation and some of this decrease is added to the un - desired states . on the other hand ,",
    "the results of finding any marked and un - marked states , in table ( [ ff1 ] ) are completely in agreement with the results shown in fig.[ff3 ] and fig.[f1 ] , under the same conditions .",
    "we have demonstrated on - demand generation of dynamic multi - qubit quantum search algorithm , which can be maintained for multi - qubit system .",
    "the algorithm we have demonstrated , gives favorable performance for multi - qubit ( up to 9 qubits ) and would survive even in the presence of the qubit dissipation .",
    "we have focused our attention on the probabilities of the first 9 qubits and have obtained that their optimal values come either to diagonalizing or to symmetrizing probabilities , that implies analytical formula for its calculation .",
    "comparing these results with grover algorithm analysis allows to give a similar result when the number of involved qubits get much larger , and is an example of a prefect observation which is suitable for a particular purpose , e.g. , for the time dependent interaction and dissipation processes .",
    "the long life time of this multi - qubit algorithm is due to a high symmetry of the generated forms .",
    "we have used different values of the controlled phase to improve the suggested algorithm performance .",
    "a new technique is used to generate the dynamical quantum gates that helps in implementing the current algorithm .",
    "the multi - qubit character of the interaction used for the creation of dynamical algorithm allows for the potential applications and extension of the present method to other models , possibly including , superconducting materials or solid state models with long lived spin states .",
    "in this appendix , we took four optional values of times ( say , @xmath249 , @xmath250 , @xmath251 and @xmath252 ) to calculate the probabilities of some marked and unmarked states for different number of @xmath7 .",

    ", it is easy to see that the sum of all probabilities for all marked and unmarked states at any time in the absence of dissipation rates is equal to one , see fig.[ff2 ] .",
    "also , from figs.[ff3 ] , fig.[f1 ] , fig.[f2 ] and the above tables , one can note that the sum of all probabilities in the presence of dissipation at different times are gradually decreased than one , and reaches almost zero at high values of dissipation rates .",
    "+ second , from tables ( [ s1]-[s10 ] ) , one observes and distinguishes between different values of times for the probabilities of each marked state at weak values of the dissipation rates .",
    "moreover , we observe for times @xmath251 , and a weak dissipation , that the probabilities of each marked states have higher probabilities than any marked state probabilities through other times .",
    "further increasing of @xmath319 and for different values of times , one can not distinguish the probabilities of some marked states for the different number of qubits , where some of un - marked states due to the influence of large dissipation exchange their values either increase or decrease the probabilities of marked states .",
    "moreover , if dissipation rates are taken to be @xmath239 , @xmath320 , one determines and observes at different times the probabilities of some marked states for different values of the number of @xmath7 .",
    "however , when @xmath321 , we can not distinguish any marked states where very small values for the probability of marked state is shown . which means that both marked and un - marked states have the same chance to contribute .",
    "one concludes that at @xmath321 , the system is destroyed completely as well as it can not search for any desired state whatever the number of qubits .",
    "it is interesting to discuss the influence of large values of dissipation on the probabilities of marked states at these optional times in the following scenario : + through the optional times @xmath249 and the number of qubits up to @xmath322 , we can not distinguish and observe the probability of any marked state for any number of qubits except the probabilities of marked states of the kind @xmath323 , @xmath324 , @xmath325 and @xmath326 .",
    "as for the case of @xmath327 , we can not distinguish the probabilities of any marked states , where the probabilities of un - marked states show larger values compared with the probability of marked state which shows a small values .",
    "+ at times @xmath250 , one distinguishes the probability of marked state for @xmath328 , @xmath329 and @xmath330qubit but for 5-qubit one can not distinguish the probabilities of any marked states except the marked states which are of the kind @xmath331 one can distinguish the probabilities for it . while through this time when @xmath327 , we can not distinguish and determine the probability of any marked state , where both marked and un - marked states have the same chance to contribute in the search .",
    "+ also , at times @xmath251 , we distinguish the probability of any marked state for different number of qubits until @xmath322 except the probabilities of the marked states @xmath332 and @xmath333 . for @xmath334 , one can not observe and determine the probability of any marked state except the marked states of the kind @xmath335 @xmath336 , where the value of any marked state probability for this kind is distinguished and shows small value and larger than the probabilities of the remaining states .",
    "however , we expect through these times for @xmath337 that one can not distinguish and determine the probability of any marked state .",
    "+ finally , at times @xmath252 , it is shown that the probability of any marked state for the different number of qubits until @xmath71 can be distinguished . as for 5-qubit and 6-qubit , we can not distinguish the probability of some marked state , see tables ( [ s8],[s10 ] ) , except the marked states of the kind @xmath331 and @xmath338 .",
    "after that , through these times , one can not observe the probabilities of any marked states at @xmath339 and more .",
    "consequently , through the large dissipation values , most marked states are distinguished through the optional times @xmath251 for the different number of qubits . as a result",
    ", one can distinguish and observe , at large values of dissipation , the probabilities of many different marked states for multi qubits at different values of times .",
