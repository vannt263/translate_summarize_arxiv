    "the application of the network formalism in the field of socioeconomic science has seen an unprecedented growth in the last decades  @xcite . most of our actions take place in network environments and neglecting such structures can lead to insufficient interaction models  @xcite and poor policy regulation  @xcite . on the global scale , the analysis of the international trade network ( itn ) , also known as the world trade web , has taken a prominent role in the study of economic systems  @xcite motivated by the ongoing process of globalization .",
    "the itn can be represented by a bipartite network in which the two layers are respectively countries and products  @xcite : a link between the two layers is present if the selected country is able to export the chosen item . in this framework",
    ", @xcite proposed an algorithm that uncovers productive capabilities of countries , as well as the complexity of products .",
    "several works  @xcite proposed different algorithms to infer relations among products from this bipartite network . however",
    ", very often such methods are either too tailored to the problem at hand and therefore lack generalizability or the observed similarity between products neglects the validation by a statistical null - model , so that the signal is indistinguishable from the noise .",
    "surprisingly , few general methods for projecting bipartite networks are present in literature , among which the seminal method proposed in  @xcite .",
    "call respectively @xmath0 and @xmath1 the two layers and suppose we want to project the bipartite network on the layer @xmath0 ; according to this method , the original bipartite network is divided into slices that are homogeneous in the degree of nodes of the opposite layer @xmath1 . comparing the presence of actual links with uniform distributions in each slice permits to establish the statistical significance of the observation and validate the co - occurrence of links between node pairs in the layer @xmath0 .",
    "even though this approach is poorly effective due to the high number of hypotheses to be tested ( one for every couple of nodes in @xmath0 for every slice ) , @xcite defines a controlled framework in which a statistical analysis can be performed .",
    "recently , many efforts have been spent in providing an unbiased monopartite projection for bipartite networks  @xcite . summarizing , through the comparison of the actual measurements with the expectations of the bipartite configuration model ( bicm ,  @xcite ) , it is possible to state if a node couple belonging to the same layer share a statistically significant fraction of their connections .",
    "actually , the bicm may be too `` strict '' and could account for all the observations in the data  @xcite : otherwise stated , the method may be too effective in reproducing original data .",
    "although the original proposal embeds the bicm  @xcite , the framework is very general and nothing prevents from using ",
    "weaker \" null - models  @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we apply the aforementioned approach ( discussed in details in  @xcite ) to the international trade network .",
    "the configuration model class is essentially obtained from the entropy maximization and , since their derivation follows the general approach of @xcite , we will refer to this method as the _ grand canonical projection algorithm_. we observe that the bicm induces a community structure which largely agrees with the socioeconomic distinction between developed , newly industrialized , developing and mainly raw material exporting countries .",
    "our analysis reveals a division within the group of developed countries around year 2000 into a core ( germany , usa , japan , france , etc . ) and a periphery ( austria , italy , spain , eastern european countries , etc . ) , with the latter acting as a bridge to developing countries .",
    "the grand canonical projection shows also the presence of communities of products , which essentially reflect the development of their exporters .",
    "in particular , technological chemistry products cluster together because they are exported by the same developed countries , while electronic devices , textiles and garments form a community since they represent the typical exports of newly industrialized and developing countries .",
    "literally , every community of countries occupies the projected network of products in a particular way , focusing their efforts on few product communities , thus implying the presence of a statistically significant signal of specialization .",
    "note that , usually , the picture arising from the analysis of the bipartite itn is interpreted as the fact that the most developed countries export literally all possible products . in the present article , we refine this picture by highlighting that developed countries focus more on the most complex , i.e. technologically advanced , goods .",
    "a similar signal was already mentioned in the supplementary information of @xcite , though not discussed in details : the observed network appeared much more disassortative than the randomisation , implying that countries with the widest export baskets link to the products with the lowest degrees , i.e. with the highest complexity , much more than expected .",
    "these new results put in relation the topological network structure with economical meaning of the case study considered .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows .",
    "firstly , we briefly introduce the ingredients of the grand canoncial projection algorithm in the methods section ; more details on the bicm and on the projection technique of the original article  @xcite are provided in the appendix a. the results section presents the monopartite projections obtained from different null - models and their composition in terms of country communities , which reflect their stages in economic development , as well as product communities , based on their technological sophistication . finally , we comment on the results and the performance of the methodology in the conclusions .",
    "we consider a binary bipartite network composed of two distinct node sets and a collection @xmath2 of undirected and unweighted edges . in the following , we distinguish the nodes sets by using latin and greek indices .",
    "the bipartite network is described by a binary biadjacency matrix @xmath3 of dimension @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the dimensions respectively of the latin and the greek layer and an edges between node couples @xmath7 is represented by the matrix entry @xmath8 .",
    "+ in a bipartite network the similarity between two nodes belonging to the same layer is usually measured by the number of common connections . even though this method is direct and intuitive",
    ", it neglects the crucial problem of determining which edges contain statistically relevant information and which do not . to address this question , in the present paper",
    "we employ the grand canonical projection methodology proposed in @xcite , since it provides exact results and a coherent formalism . in the following ,",
    "we will briefly review the method , inviting the interested reader to the original article .",
    "the grand canonical projection algorithm proposed in @xcite yields a statistically validated monopartite projection of a bipartite network by comparing the observed node similarities with the expectations from a suitable null - model .",

    "the bicm is an entropy based null - model in which the information of the degree sequence of both layers is discounted .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the degree sequence is able to capture much of the structure of the bipartite international trade , as the triangular nested shape of the biadjacency matrix .",
    "hence , discounting the degree sequence with a null - model allows to uncover more detailed substructures , which are otherwise hardly observable .",
    "+ in a nutshell , the methods is divided into two steps : the entropy maximisation and the likelihood maximisation . at the first step , we defined @xmath16 , an ensemble of bipartite graphs in which the number of nodes per layer is fixed to the value of the network under analysis , and the number of links can vary .",
    "then we can define the entropy of the ensemble as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the probability assigned to every @xmath19 . in bicm , we want to maximize the entropy constraining the degree sequence of both layers .",
    "call @xmath20 and @xmath21 the degrees of the node @xmath22 and @xmath23 , defined respectively on the latin and the greek layer , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 their relative lagrangian multipliers ; after the entropy maximisation the probability per graph reads @xmath26 ( see appendix a for more details ) .",
    "the probability obtained is function of the unknown lagrangian multipliers @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in order to have an estimation of them ,",
    "let us maximise the likelihood @xmath27 of the real network .",
    "it can be shown that the maximisation of the likelihood is equivalent to imposing that the expectation values over the ensemble for the degree sequence are equal to those of the real network , in formulas @xmath28 where starred quantities indicates values measured on the real network . by solving the previous equations in @xmath24 and @xmath25 , it is possible to obtain the explicit value of the probability per graph in the ensemble .",
    "one of the most powerful properties of the bicm is that it provides independent probabilities per link , which in turn permits to readily calculate the expectation values of more complicated quantities .",
    "for instance , the average number of v - motifs between @xmath22 and @xmath29 is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the probability of observing a link between nodes @xmath22 and @xmath23 according to the bicm . in the following we",
    "compute the expected values of the bipartite motifs presented in the previous paragraph according to the bicm .",
    "for the present target , the constraints may turn out to be too strict , meaning that they capture the main information contained in the network and no statistical significant signal can be seen . in this case , it is opportune to relax the constraints and fix the degrees of just a single layer ; this model was proposed as bipartite partial configuration model ( bipcm ,  @xcite ) .",
    "implicitly , the bipcm@xmath32 , i.e. the one in which only the degree sequence of the latin layer is captured , is equivalent to a bicm in which all nodes in the greek layer have degrees equal to their mean .",
    "the bipcm@xmath32 is more effective in reproducing the observed number of v - motifs rather than the number of @xmath11 .",
    "intuitively , the degrees of the nodes @xmath22 and @xmath29 carry more information about the @xmath33 than the degree of the opposite layer ; analogously , the bipcm@xmath34 reproduces @xmath11-motifs better than v - motifs . in some cases , the projection of the real bipartite network is completely reconstructed by its ( bipartite ) degree sequence and , as a filter , the bicm would be too strict to validated any links in the projection algorithm and the use of the bipcm is thus recommended . by neglecting the information contained in the degree sequence of the layer opposite to the one of the projection , the bipcm allows for stronger fluctuations stemming from the heterogeneity of the degrees which can be captured by the projection . a unique criterion for deciding a priori which null - model is more effective is currently missing and we are currently examining the limits of the different projections .",
    "this notwithstanding , as a rule of thumb , we suggest that the bipcm should be used when one deals with bipartite layers of very different lengths ( @xmath35 ) and one intends to project on the longer layer . since the variability of the bipartite motifs is determined by the opposite layer , which is much shorter in this case , the bicm is likely not to validate any links . in all other cases , the bicm should be preferred .",
    "+ in the literature , the recent curveball algorithm is another possible way to discount the degree - sequence information in an unbiased null model for bipartite networks .",
    "the authors implement a degree - sequence - preserving rewiring algorithm in order to explicitly build the ensemble of networks .",
    "remarkably , the method is ergodic , i.e. it explores the phases space uniformly  @xcite ( note that the ergodicity of bicm is automatically obtained by construction ) .",
    "although the algorithm is relatively fast , the fact that it is micro canonical does not permit to calculate the expectation values of different quantities , thus preventing the possibility of writing an expression like eq.([eq : expectedv ] ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath36 can be estimated as the average over a sample of the original ensemble defined by the curveball algorithm . however , this sample has to be big enough in order to provide a sufficient statistics , i.e. to represent at best the whole ensemble without losing its statistical properties . for big networks ,",
    "this procedure implies the presence of a large sample , which is hard to handle and makes the calculation times increase dramatically .    [",

    "the bipcms provide different distributions : for bipcm@xmath32 , v - motifs follow a different binomial distribution for every couple @xmath37 , whereas @xmath11-motif distribution is the same poisson - binomial distribution for every couple @xmath38 .",

    "we use the baci hs 2007 database from cepii   to construct the bipartite network , which comprises the export data for the years 1995 - 2010 .",

    ", we adopt the 2007 code revision ( hs 2007 ) with four digit codes describing 1131 different products . in order to binarize data ,",
    "it is customary to apply the revealed comparative advantage ( rca ) , also referred to as balassa index  @xcite , which describes whether a specific country is a relevant exporter of a product ( rca@xmath40 ) or not ( rca@xmath41 ) by comparing the relative monetary importance of the product in the country s export basket to the global average .",
    "the rca is defined as @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the export value of product @xmath44 in country @xmath45 s export basket .      in the bipartite itn ,",
    "the degree distributions resemble a power - law for the countries and a gaussian for the products .",
    "the degree heterogeneity can be approximately captured by the coefficient of variation ( cv ) , i.e. the standard deviation over the mean , @xmath46 . as a rule of thumb ,",
    "the larger the cv the less informative is the mean about the whole distribution .",
    "the probabilities per link of the partial model bipcm@xmath47 ( bipcm@xmath34 ) are those of bicm in which the degree sequence of the opposite layer is approximated by its mean , i.e. @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , where @xmath50 is the total number of edges .",
    "since the cv varies between 0.5 and 0.55 for the products and between 0.82 and 0.89 for the countries , the bipcm@xmath47 will reproduce the v - motifs better between the countries than the bipcm@xmath34 the @xmath51motifs between the products . generally speaking",
    ", the approximation implied by the partial null - models will work best for small cv and lose accuracy as the cv increases . in the trade data set we examine , the number of products is almost 10 times the number of countries and the biadjacency matrix is hence strongly rectangular .",
    "the connectance varies during the years between 0.09 and almost 0.13 .",
    "this feature is related to the division of products in categories ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the degree sequences of the binary bipartite trade network represent the sizes of country export baskets and the number of exporters of products , respectively . implementing a null - model which discounts the information from the degree sequence ( e.g. bicm and bipcm ) implies focusing on structures that are not already contained in the heterogeneity of the degree distribution .",
    "for instance , in the bicm the us export basket keeps its size while the composition of export products within the basket is randomized . in the following",
    ", we shall observe effects in the structure of the international trade that are not explained by dishomogeneities of the degree sequence .",
    "the projection on the country layer induced by the bicm reveals important information on different levels of economic development and the roles played by various countries in the globalization process .         for the year 2001 .",

    "furthermore , we discern a fifth group whose composition fluctuates strongly during the considered time interval",

    "the community includes , among others , australia , new zealand , canada , chile , and argentina .",

    "this explains why they are loosely linked to poorly industrialized nations like mauritania , whose most important trade goods derive from fishing activities . as a result of the weak connectivity within the group , countries oscillate between different communities , which can clearly be seen , for example , for australia and canada in fig .

    "[ fig : bipcm_c_map_3 ] that the fluctuating community disappears and the division of countries is more static , thus weakening the constraints of the null - model reduces the noise in the projection . as a matter of fact",
    ", neglecting the constraints on the product layer means considering just the mean of the product degree sequence .",

    "for instance , the bicm manages to capture the split - off of italy and spain from the developed countries , as well as the separation of the developed european countries in an eastern and a western part during the years 1997 - 2002 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bicm_bipcm_net ] , germany and austria form a bridge between the western and eastern nations , with the latter themselves connecting to developing countries .",
    "+ another striking result of the analysis of the country projection is the fact that many post - soviet states still share a similar economic development years after the dissolution of the soviet union .",
    "a similar signal was detected in @xcite .",
    "the bicm - induced projection of the bipartite itn network on the product layer does not reveal any statistically significant links , as already mentioned in @xcite .",
    "in other words , the degree sequence of both countries and products contains enough information to account for the observed product similarities in terms of the @xmath11-motifs .",
    "this observation stands in stark contrast to the country projection and is mainly due to two reasons connected to the different cardinalities of the layers .",
    "firstly , the effective _ p_-value threshold for the validation procedure is proportional to the ratio of the significance level @xmath23 over the number of tests that have to be performed , i.e. @xmath54 for @xmath55 nodes , as shown in appendix a. hence , the statistical validation is more restrictive on `` longer '' layers . in our case ,",
    "the product layer is almost ten times larger than the country layer , which leads to a comparatively smaller effective threshold level .",
    "secondly , the variability of node degrees depends on the length of the opposite layer , as mentioned in the methods section , since the degree of each node stays in the interval between 1 and the dimension of the opposite layer .",
    "the degree heterogeneity of the longer layer is thus generally more limited compared to the shorter layer , which reduces the possible different values of the bipartite motifs between products , in the present case .",
    "+ due to the behavior of the bicm , we implemented the bipcm@xmath56 to perform the validation procedure for product similarities .",
    "as mentioned in the methods section , constraining the degrees of the projected layer is more effective in reproducing the @xmath11-motifs distribution .",
    "however , bipcm@xmath56 is going to be less effective in reproducing @xmath51motifs than bipcm@xmath52 in reproducing v - motifs . as mentioned above , it is recommendable to constrain the product degrees to reproduce the @xmath51motif distribution rather than the country degrees .",
    "compared to the application of the bipcm@xmath57 for the v - motifs , however , we expect the bipcm@xmath58 to perform worse since the coefficient of variation for the countries cv@xmath59 indicates a higher loss of information when approximating the country degree sequence by its mean .",
    "the bipcm@xmath56-induced product networks are sparse with connectances in the range of 0.009 - 0.013 and highly fragmented for the years 1995 - 2010 . as shown by the jaccard indices of the edge sets in fig .",

    "it is possible to observe two hot areas , one in the top left corner , showing that low fitness countries export basic wares much more than the average ( @xmath69 ) ; the other one in the opposite corner , which highlight the tendency of developed countries export significantly sophisticated products ( @xmath70 ) . on the other hand , high fitness country export of basic goods is much less than expected : the bottom left corner has @xmath71 .",
    "basically , it is possible to observe a  hot \" line just below the diagonal of the matrix and a  cold \" one just below , highlighting the tendency of countries to focus on the most sophisticated products they are able to export , compatibly with the dimension of their export basket .",
    "in the present paper we analyze the relations among countries and among products in the bipartite representation of the international trade network ( itn )  @xcite by implementing a recently proposed strategy for the projection of bipartite networks  @xcite .",
    "such methods are based on the bipartite configuration model  @xcite , an entropy - based null - model discounting the information of node degrees . as a matter of fact",
    ", it has been shown that the degree sequence is responsible for the main characteristics of the international trade network , such as the triangular structure of the biadjacency matrix between countries and products , see fig .",
    "[ fig : biadj ] , @xcite using the bicm as a filter permits to uncover the structure of the network not explained by node degrees .",
    "the application of the bicm to the itn as a statistical null - model reveals communities of countries with similar economic development , namely developed , newly industrialized , and developing countries , and raw material ( e.g. oil ) exporters .",
    "these groups are stable during the years 1995 - 2010 except for some small deviations due to different progress in the ongoing globalization process .",
    "the communities become even more stable using the bipcm ( a weaker version of bicm in which the degree sequence of only a single layer is constrained ) for the monopartite projection . at the same time , however , the bipcm is not able to detect smaller details like , for example , the post - soviet state community , which , instead bicm is able to capture .",
    "regarding the product layer , the bicm turns out to be too restrictive to uncover any significant product similarities . in other words ,",
    "the information contained in the degree sequence of both layers is enough to account for the observed product relations in the data . investigating the similarity among products",
    "therefore requires a relaxation of the constraints , logically leading to the application of the bipcm .",
    "such a phenomenon is essentially due to the rectangularity of the biadjacency matrix , i.e. to the dimension of the support of the distribution of bipartite motifs ( for details see the methods section ) . using the bipcm",
    ", we find product communities which define different industrialization levels and reflect the economic stages of their exporting countries .",
    "highly sophisticated chemical products distinguish developed from newly industrialized and developing countries , whose exports focus mainly on electronic articles like diodes and telephones , or textiles and garments",
    ". it is worth pointing out that the communities are generally not due to productive chains , which should be reflected in a tree - like organization of the network . observed clusters suggest that they are rather defined by the way countries organize their export baskets .",
    "remarkably , our methods reveals a deeper structure than those discussed in @xcite .",
    "as had already been observed in previous studies , the biadjacency matrix of the country - product itn is approximately triangular , which highlights the tendency of developed countries to export all possible products and not just the most exclusive ones .",
    "this observation conflicts with the ricardo hypothesis , according to which countries should specialize their pro - duction on the most sophisticated products according to their resources .",
    "however , as already mentioned , but not fully discussed , in the supplementary material of  @xcite , the real network appears as more disassortative than expected by discounting the degree sequence",
    ". otherwise stated , countries with a larger export basket tend to export more sophisticated products than expected . in the present paper",
    "we fully observe such a phenomenon through the different occupation patterns of product networks : different country communities , with different technological levels tend to organise differently their export baskets , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : okk ] .",
    "the heat color of fig .",
    "[ fig : biadj ] shows this phenomenon directly on the biadjacency matrix",
    ". for every entry we considered a box 20 countries @xmath65 80 products : the colours represent the z - scores encoding the discrepancy between the number of observed links in the box and its expectation of bicm null - model ( results are independent on the dimension of the box ) .",
    "lighter colours represent abundances of links that are not explained by the null - model , while darker colours a lack in the links presence not compatible with bicm . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : biadj ] , countries do not abandon the production of the most basic wares ,",
    "but anyway they focus their exports on the most exclusive products , such that the hotter areas are close to the diagonal , i.e. for the most exclusive products in country export baskets",
    ". one can argue that the ricardo hypothesis appears as a sort of second order effect : at first order the structure of the biadjacency matrix shows that most developed countries are those with the largest export baskets ( not those focused on most exclusive ones ) , at the second order a tendency to specialisation is visible through a denser area in the export basket for the most sophisticated products .",
    "+ summarising , the grand canonical projection algorithm uncovers subtle structures in the network under analysis : in the case of the world trade web , it reveals an industrial specialisation effect of country exports which is not appreciable without the implementation of a null - model .",
    "this observation reconciles the apparent contrast between recent studies that describe the development of national productive capabilities in terms of the size of the export baskets on the one hand , and standard economics and the ricardo hypothesis expecting an industrial specialization on increasingly complex products on the other hand . from our analysis",
    "we can conclude that the degree sequence of the bipartite network is responsible for the triangular shape of the country - product biadjacency matrix , and thus for the former , whereas the specialization effect is uncovered only once this information is discounted with the help of appropriately defined null - models .",
    "+ we expect that the application of the grand canonical projection algorithm may reveal deeper structures even in other fields in which bipartite networks are heavily used . in biology , for example ,",
    "statistically validated projections of mutualisitic network of pollinators and plants could uncover interaction patterns among pollinator species due to competition , for which measurements are rarely available and which remain generally unknown @xcite .",
