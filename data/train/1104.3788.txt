    "the map is named for torelli who proved that it is injective @xcite .",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath1 are quasi - projective varieties .",
    "the deligne - mumford compactification @xmath0 is obtained by adding nodal curves having a finite number of automorphisms . while this is often taken to be the best compactification of @xmath2 , the closure in any compactification of @xmath1 of the image of @xmath2 under the torelli map gives an alternative one .",
    "in particular , if the torelli map extends to a morphism from @xmath0 to that compactification of @xmath1 , then one may be able to say something interesting about the moduli space of curves .",
    "for example , the satake compactification @xmath7 is the normal projective variety constructed by taking proj of the graded ring of siegel modular forms @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the torelli map extends to a morphism @xmath8 , and by studying the image @xmath9 in @xmath7 , one can prove the very interesting and nontrivial fact that @xmath2 contains a complete curve for @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "there are infinitely many toroidal compactifications @xmath11 of @xmath1 , each dependent on a choice of fan @xmath12 , which describes a decomposition of the cone of real positive quadratic forms in @xmath3 variables ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "also , for each @xmath12 , there is a morphism @xmath14 from @xmath11 to satake s compactification @xmath15 .",
    "the first result of this short note is that any regular extension of the torelli map from @xmath0 to a compactification of @xmath1 having these properties is given by a sublinear system of a divisor lying on what will be shown to be a 2-dimensional extremal face of the nef cone of @xmath0 :    [ general ] let @xmath16 be any compactification of @xmath1 that contains mumford s partial compactification @xmath13 and maps to satake s compactification @xmath17 .",
    "then if @xmath18 is any extension of the torelli map and @xmath19 any ample divisor on @xmath16 , then @xmath20 lies in the interior of the face @xmath21 .    mumford and namikawa @xcite , have shown that @xmath22 extends to a morphism @xmath23 to the voronoi compactification of @xmath1 , and very recently alexeev and brunyate @xcite have shown that the torelli map extends to a morphism @xmath24 , to the perfect cone compactification . by using the morphism @xmath25 , it is possible to see that every divisor in @xmath26 gives rise to such an extension of the torelli map :    [ perfect]let @xmath27 be the toroidal extension of the torelli map defined in @xcite .",

    "as is proved in corollary [ semiample ] , it follows from @xcite that if we take @xmath0 to be defined over @xmath30 , then the nef divisor @xmath31 is actually semi - ample for @xmath32 . to exhibit the nontriviality of these statements , in remark [ bpf ]",

    "in contrast , the picard group of @xmath33 has rank @xmath55 , and the nef cone of @xmath33 has been explicitly described @xcite .",
    "the result from theorem [ general ] , that all pullbacks of ample divisors from toroidal compactifications lie in the face @xmath26 , begs the question of whether , in fact , the images of @xmath0 under these extensions are all isomorphic . there is some evidence for this possibility already .",
    "alexeev and brunyate @xcite show that the image of @xmath0 under @xmath56 is isomorphic to its image under their extension of torelli map to the perfect compactification .",
    "one consequence of theorem  [ general ] gives at least a rough comparison of the images of @xmath0 under morphisms to them :    [ pic]the image of @xmath0 under any extension of the torelli map to a compactification of @xmath1 that contains mumford s partial compactification @xmath13 and maps to satake s compactification @xmath17 has picard number @xmath55 .",
