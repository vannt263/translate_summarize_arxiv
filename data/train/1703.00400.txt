    "gravitationally lensed quasars are very well suited to study the inner structure of agn @xcite .",
    "the magnification of lensed quasar images depends on the mass distribution of the lens galaxy and on geometrical considerations ( distances and alignment between quasar , galaxy and observer ) .",
    "therefore , the mean ( or macromodel ) flux ratios between images would be very useful observables to study the mass density profile in lens galaxies , assuming that all the lens galaxy mass is smoothly distributed .",
    "however , compact objects such as stars in the lens galaxies induce strong spatial gradients in the gravitational potential that give rise to anomalies in the flux ratios compared to the predictions of macromodels .",
    "this effect ( so - called microlensing ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) complicates the macro - modeling of lens systems but in exchange it has a very useful property : it is sensitive to the source size ( with smaller source regions showing larger magnifications ) .",
    "thus , we can study the size of the emitting region by measuring flux ratios to deduce the effects of microlensing .",
    "taking advantage of this property , the inner structure of agns can be studied by searching for the effects of microlensing on different regions of single - epoch spectra of the images of a lensed quasar @xcite .",
    "the cores of the emission lines , which likely arise from extended regions , is insensitive to microlensing , so their flux ratios are a baseline against which we can measure the effects of microlensing on other regions of smaller size , such as the wings of the emission lines @xcite and the continuum generated by the accretion disk . according to the thin disk model @xcite , the size of the continuum varies with wavelength with a @xmath10 law , and hence the microlensing magnification will show some wavelength dependence ( so - called microlensing chromaticity ) .",
    "the objective of this paper is to use single - epoch spectra of three gravitationally lensed quasars ( he0435 - 1223 , wfi2033 - 4723 , and he2149 - 2745 ) to discuss the presence of microlensing in the emission lines ( which would yield information on the structure of the blr ) and in the continuum ( to estimate sizes and temperature gradients in the accretion disk ) .",
