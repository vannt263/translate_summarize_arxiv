    "@xmath169 become negative , there is the point @xmath193 such that @xmath194 . at @xmath195 ,",
    "therefore , we can connect two @xmath74branes without tension terms . if the junction point @xmath172 is @xmath196 , we need positive tension terms to connect two @xmath74branes , while negative tension terms are needed if @xmath197 .",
    "this configuration is possible only in the case with @xmath180 .",
    "since the @xmath92brane can be in the range @xmath198 for the positive mass , branes should be connected in this region .",
    "we can easily obtain @xmath199 while we saw @xmath192 . since @xmath200 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath65 ,",
    "@xmath201 is always positive for @xmath198 .",
    "therefore , we see from eq .",
    "( [ 3djun ] ) that only negative tension terms can make the branes connected .    for the negative mass bulk ,",
    "the situation is similar to the positive mass case .",
    "first of all , it is easy to see @xmath202 through the direct calculation , where @xmath203 .",
    "the value of @xmath204 is written as @xmath205 introducing the parameter @xmath185 as @xmath206 we regard @xmath204 as the function of @xmath185 as @xmath207 here note that @xmath188 is the same as that introduced before . since we have already shown the positivity of @xmath188 for @xmath208 , @xmath204 is positive .",
    "then the monotonically decreasing property of @xmath200 implies the positivity of @xmath201 for @xmath209 , and eq .",
    "( [ 3djun ] ) shows us that the negative tension terms are needed to connect the branes .    as a result , for this configuration of branes , we need a negative tension term in this configuration .",
    "it is probably unphysical because of the negative energy density .",
    "this configuration is possible only for @xmath210 .",
    "we can consider both cases of positive and negative mass bulks .",
    "this configuration always has the junction between two @xmath92branes .",
    "let us look at the details shortly .",
    "@xmath211 becomes zero at @xmath177 for a positive mass bulk and at @xmath212 for a negative mass bulk .",
    "the monotonically decreasing property of @xmath211 leads to the positivity of @xmath211 . as a result ,",
    "it is impossible to construct physically interesting solutions without introducing negative tension terms .",
    "in this paper we constructed the dgp braneworld with a bubble of nothing .",
    "surprisingly , we could have the single brane solutions .",
    "this is impressive because we could not for the randall - sundrum braneworld .",
    "the solution with a single brane exists only for @xmath68 , while for @xmath89 solutions with connected two branes can be constructed even without any matter fields on branes .",
    "therein , the contribution of deficit structure on five - dimensional spacetime is balanced with that of a singular surface on the brane , that is , codimension - two objects in the bulk aspect . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it may be out of applicable range of the dgp - braneworld description because both contributions diverge",
    ". however , the tensionless solution sets the expectation that even in an uv completion for the dgp model less matter field is to construct the solution with two branes .",
    "in general , the existence of the configuration founded here could lead to the semiclassical instability of dgp braneworld .",
    "if so , this may be fatal to the dgp braneworld model .",
    "but , as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the supersymmetry may protect such instability .",
    "moreover , there is a question for the initial state before the decay ; that is , is the dgp vacuum with the single brane the initial state for the solution founded here ?",
    "since the size of the junction point is larger than @xmath7 , the bubble size is also large .",
    "@xmath7 is expected to be a cosmological scale , and then the decay rate of the dgp vacuum to the bubble is exponentially suppressed .",
    "this is because the decay to spacetimes with large volume has a tendency to be suppressed as usual .",
    "the solutions constructed in this paper have the same asymptotic structure as the normal branch solutions on the minkowski bulk with compactification to the extra direction .",
    "thus , the solutions probably describe the spacetime after the decay of the normal branch . however , if one could have the solutions for the self - accelerating branch , the suppression for the decay rate to the single - brane solution might be relaxed . the detailed analysis based on quantum gravity will be interesting .",
    "there is also a problem that the self - accelerating brane is copiously nucleated @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that our solutions themselves could be worth investigating .",
    "the geometry on a single brane is like the einstein - rosen bridge .",
    "since we consider the vacuum brane , any energy conditions are not violated .",
    "this is an example of wormhole spacetime which satisfies the energy conditions .",
    "the detailed analysis will be reported in the near future @xcite .",
