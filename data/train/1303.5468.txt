    ", @xcite proposed a separation between moderately and strongly irradiated planets .",
    "the higher atmospheric temperatures of the more strongly irradiated planets allow the presence of highly opaque molecules ( like tio and vo ) at high altitudes .",
    "these strong absorbers produce hot stratospheres ( thermal inversion layers ) .",
    "in contrast , for the moderately irradiated hot jupiters , these absorbers condense and rain out to altitudes below the photosphere , thus presenting no thermal inversions .    in general ,",
    "the observations agree with this hypothesis , but exceptions indicate that the picture is not yet completely understood .",
    "for example , secondary - eclipse observations of the highly irradiated wasp-12b @xcite , wasp-14b @xcite , and tres-3 @xcite do not show evidence of thermal inversions .",
    "conversely , xo-1 has an inversion layer even though it receives a much lower stellar irradiation @xcite .",
    "photochemistry provides one explanation .",
    "the non - equilibrium atmospheric chemistry models of @xcite suggested that heating from sulfur compounds in the upper atmospheres of hot jupiters could explain these inversions .",

    "the planet orbits the brighter component ( wasp-8a ) of a binary stellar system .",
    "the angular separation ( 4.83 ) with the secondary ( wasp-8b ) sets a minimum separation of 440 au between the stars .",

    "wasp-8b is a 2.18 jupiter - mass ( @xmath8 ) planet with 1.08 times jupiter s radius ( @xmath9 ) in a retrograde 8.16 day orbit .",
    "its large eccentricity ( @xmath10 ) should make the planet s dayside temperature vary by hundreds of degrees along the orbit , possibly forcing an unusual climate .",

    "the _ spitzer _",
    "bandpasses at 3.6 , 4.5 , and 8.0 @xmath1 m  contain strong spectral features due to several carbon and oxygen - based molecules that are expected in hot - jupiter atmospheres .",
    "methane ( ch4 ) has strong spectral features in the 3.6 and 8.0 @xmath1 m  bands , carbon monoxide ( co ) and carbon dioxide ( co2 ) have features at 4.5 @xmath1 m , while water vapor ( h2o ) has features in all three bands @xcite .",
    "the spectral features of the various molecules appear as absorption troughs or emission peaks in the emergent spectrum depending on whether the temperature decreases or increases with altitude , respectively .",
    "consequently , strong degeneracies exist between the temperature structure and molecular composition derived from a spectral dataset ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we assume a kurucz model for the stellar spectrum @xcite given the stellar parameters .",
    "the pressure - temperature ( @xmath11@xmath7 ) profile and molecular mixing ratios are free parameters in the model , which can be constrained from the data .",
    "the @xmath11@xmath7  profile comprises of six free parameters and the mixing ratio of each molecular species constitutes an additional free parameter . following @xcite , we parametrize the mixing ratio of each species as deviations from thermochemical equilibrium assuming solar elemental abundances @xcite . we include the dominant sources of opacity expected in hot jupiter atmospheres , namely molecular absorption due to h2o , co , ch4 and co2 ( @xcite ; r.s .",

    "we explore the model parameter space in a bayesian way using an mcmc sampler @xcite . given the limited number of observations ( @xmath13=3 ) ,",
    "our goal is not to find a unique model fit to the data ; instead , we intend to constrain the region of atmospheric parameter space that is allowed or ruled out by the data .",
    "our observations rule out a thermal inversion in the dayside atmosphere of wasp-8b .",
    "this is evident from the planet ",
    "star flux contrasts in the three irac bands at 3.6 , 4.5 , and 8.0 @xmath1 m . in the presence of a thermal inversion , the planet ",
    "star flux contrasts in the 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath1 m  bands are both expected to be greater than the flux contrast in the 3.6 @xmath1 m  band @xcite , due to spectral features of the dominant molecules appearing as emission peaks as opposed to absorption troughs",
    ". however , the low 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath1 m  flux contrasts relative to the 3.6 @xmath1 m  contrast requires significant absorption due to h@xmath12o and co across the spectrum , and hence the lack of a thermal inversion in the atmosphere .",
    "figure [ fig : atm ] shows model spectra of wasp-8b with no thermal inversion in the temperature profile .",
    "the observed 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath1 m  flux contrasts are explained to a good level of fit by a model without a thermal inversion and with solar abundance composition , as shown by the green curve in figure  [ fig : atm ] .",
    "our inference of the lack of a thermal inversion in wasp-8b is independent of any assumption about chemical composition or c / o ratio ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the lack of a thermal inversion in wasp-8b is not surprising , since it is amongst the cooler population of irradiated hot jupiters , which are not expected to host inversion - causing species such as tio or vo in their upper atmosphere @xcite .",
    "our models are unable to reproduce the high planet ",
    "star flux contrast observed in the 3.6 @xmath1 m  irac band , independent of the composition .",
    "the major sources of absorption in the 3.6 @xmath1 m  band are h2o and ch4 . in principle , decreasing the ch4 and/or h2o abundances can lead to a higher 3.6 @xmath1 m  contrast . however , as shown by the red curve in figure  [ fig : atm ] , such an increase also simultaneously increases the contrast in the 8.0 @xmath1 m  band , thereby worsening the fit overall .",
    "another hindrance to fitting the observed 3.6 @xmath1 m  contrast is that it requires a hotter @xmath11@xmath7profile , with @xmath14 1550 k in the lower atmosphere , predicts much higher fluxes in the 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath1 m  bands than observed . on the other hand , a cooler @xmath11@xmath7  profile than shown in figure  [ fig : atm ]",
    "would provide a better fit in the 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath1 m  bands , but would further worsen the fit in the 3.6 @xmath1 m  band .",
    "consequently , we choose an intermediate @xmath11@xmath7  profile that provides a compromise fit to all three data points .",
    "although the one - dimensional ( 1d ) models shown in figure  [ fig : atm ] output less energy than the instantaneous incident irradiation during the eclipse ( concurrent with periastron passage ) , they output @xmath15 20% higher energy compared to the time - averaged incident irradiation received at the substellar point . considering that a pseudo - synchronous rotation should facilitate the redistribution of energy to the night side , the high emission measured suggests that wasp-8b is quickly reradiating the incident irradiation on its dayside hemisphere , i.e. nearly zero day  night redistribution .",
    "such a scenario would lead to a large day  night temperature contrast in the planet which can be confirmed by thermal phase curves of the planet observed using warm spitzer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the high emergent flux also implies a very low albedo , as with most hot - jupiter planets @xcite .",
    "as seen in the previous section , the 3.6-@xmath1 m  brightness temperature is anomalously higher than expected .",
    "the hemisphere - averaged equilibrium temperature for instantaneous reradiation ( time - averaged around the orbit ) is only 948 k ; even the instantaneous equilibrium temperature at periapsis , 1128 k , is far lower than this observation .",
    "thus , we modeled the orbital thermal variation due to the eccentricity to determine if such a high temperature is possible from irradiation alone .",
    "following @xcite , we solved the energy balance equation in a one - layer latitude  longitude grid over the planetary surface .",
    "the change in temperature of a cell with time , @xmath16 , is determined by the difference between the absorbed flux from the star and the re - emitted blackbody flux , @xmath17 , \\label{eq : ebalance}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the heat capacity per unit area ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the star s effective temperature and radius , respectively ; @xmath21 is the planet ",
    "star separation ; @xmath22 is the cosine of the angle between the vectors normal to the planet surface and the incident radiation , with @xmath23 the latitude of the cell and @xmath24 the longitude from the substellar meridian ; @xmath25 is the stefan  boltzmann constant .",
    "tidal interactions drive the planet s rotational angular velocity ( @xmath26 ) toward synchronization with the orbital angular velocity ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "hence , if the spin synchronization timescale ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is shorter than the system age , we expect @xmath28 . in the case of wasp-8b ,",
    "the timescale for tidal synchronization is on the order of 0.05 gyr , much shorter than the age of the star .",
    "however , a planet in an eccentric orbit , where @xmath27 changes in time , is actually expected to reach a pseudo - synchronization state ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which the planet does not exchange net angular momentum with its orbit .",
    "the planet acquires then a constant rotational angular velocity close to the orbital angular velocity at periastron ( @xmath29 ) . in the literature we found different predictions for this equilibrium angular velocity , from @xmath30 @xcite to @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the tidal evolution drives the orbit of a planet toward zero obliquity in a timescale similar to the spin synchronization @xcite .",
    "we thus adopted zero obliquity for our simulations .",
    "we also assumed @xmath32 , supported by the atmospheric analysis ( section [ sec : atmosphere ] ) . beyond these assumptions ,",
    "the parameters of interest that control equation ( [ eq : ebalance ] ) are the radiative time @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 is the substellar equilibrium temperature at periastron ) and the rotational angular velocity of the planet @xmath35 ( which determines the substellar longitude of a cell through the equation @xmath36 ) . with these definitions equation ( [ eq : ebalance ] )",
    "can be re - written as : @xmath37 .",
    "\\label{eq : ebalance2}\\ ] ]    we derived the temperature of each cell as a function of time to study its thermal evolution . assuming that each cell emits as a blackbody , we calculated the photometric phase curve of the planet by integrating over the hemisphere observable from earth , weighted by the viewing geometry .",
    "our simulations were for planets nearly in pseudo - synchronous rotation ( @xmath38 0.8 , 1.0 , and @xmath39 ) .",
    "we tested values of @xmath40 between 1 and 3 hours .",
    "figure [ fig : model ] shows simulated brightness - temperature lightcurves of wasp-8b after reaching a periodic stationary state ( after a few @xmath40 ) .",
    "we noted that the higher irradiation at periastron is not the only contribution to a higher temperature . for @xmath41 ,",
    "the substellar angular velocity ( @xmath42 ) is minimum during periastron , allowing the temperature to increase due to the longer exposure to the irradiation . for @xmath43 ,",
    "the substellar angular velocity is negative for an instant around periastron .",
    "later , when the planet emerges from secondary eclipse the over - heated region becomes observable from earth .",
    "as a result , the lightcurve shows a delayed maximum .    ) for different radiative times ( see legend ) .",
    "the curves with smaller @xmath40 show larger amplitudes . for @xmath40",
    "comparable to the orbit period , and since @xmath44 , opposite sides will face the star during successive periastron passages , leading to two bright spots and hence three periodic peaks per orbit . ]",
    "our models show that for large radiative timescales , the temperatures at secondary eclipse are lower than 1150 k , regardless of @xmath26 . for radiative times shorter than @xmath5",
    "hr , the temperatures can be as high as 1400 k , similar to the 3.6-@xmath1 m  measurement ( figure [ fig : model ] , top panel ) .",
    "however , these models still can not explain the observed brightness - temperature discrepancy with wavelength .    the study of eccentric hot - jupiter atmospheric circulation by @xcite hints at a resolution to this discrepancy .",
    "their figure  4 ( top panel ) shows that , as the planet passes through periapsis , the time that the peak temperature is reached varies as a function of pressure .",
    "this is typical of their simulations ( t. kataria 2009 , private communication ) .",
    "if this differential response is significant in wasp-8b , it would introduce a discrepancy in the observations since the _ spitzer _  bands sample different altitudes ( see figure [ fig : model ] right panel ) .",
    "another possibility is to compare the radiative and advective timescales at the altitudes sampled by each band .",
    "evaluating equation ( 1 ) of @xcite using wasp-8b s @xmath11@xmath7 profile , indicates that @xmath40 increases with depth between 0.1 and 1.0 bar , so there should be less longitudinal temperature contrast at depth . on the other hand , models of @xcite show that wind speeds decrease with depth , and thus @xmath40 also increases with depth .",
    "if the increase of @xmath40 with depth is sharper than that of @xmath40 , then one would expect less - homogenized temperatures at depth ( but still above the photosphere ) .",
    "hence , the rise in temperature ( due to the increasing incident irradiation ) near periapsis could be more pronounced at 3.6 @xmath1 m than at longer wavelengths , given the weighting functions of figure [ fig : atm ] .",
    "_ spitzer _  observed secondary eclipses of wasp-8b in the 3.6 , 4.5 , and 8.0 @xmath1 m  irac wavebands . in our joint - fit model , we estimate eclipse depths of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 at 3.6 , 4.5 , and 8.0 @xmath1 m , respectively .",
    "these depths correspond to brightness temperatures of 1552 , 1131 , and 938 k , respectively .",
    "although the 3.6-@xmath1meclipse depth is unexpectedly large , most of the ramp models had consistent depths ( within 1@xmath25 ) , while those with inconsistent depths fit the data poorly .",
    "considering the @xmath11@xmath7  profile of wasp-8b , kcl , zns , li , lif , or nas clouds could form ( see figure 2(a ) of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in analogy to brown dwarfs",
    ", partial cloud coverage can cause photometric variability @xcite ; however , our three 4.5 @xmath1mobservations , spanning 1.5 years , have consistent eclipse depths , suggesting no temporal variation at secondary eclipse above a hemispheric - mean level of @xmath48 k ( 1@xmath25 ) .",
    "a moderate cloud layer at altitudes higher than those probed by _",
    "spitzer _  would produce a featureless planetary spectrum at wavelengths shorter than 2 @xmath1 m  @xcite and would block some of the stellar flux , decreasing the temperatures at levels probed by _",
    "spitzer_. yet , the observed temperatures , which exceed the time - averaged equilibrium temperature , challenge this idea .",
    "given the high eccentricity , spin - orbit misalignment , and observed rv drift in the of wasp-8 system , @xcite suggested the existence of an additional , unseen body in the system .",
    "our orbital analysis is consistent with theirs .",
    "it also improves the orbital parameters and extends the baseline of sampled epochs .",
    "this constrains the long - term evolution of the orbit and aids the search for a second planet , for example through the study of timing variations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the eclipse depths probe the dayside atmosphere of wasp-8b .",
    "our results rule out the presence of a thermal inversion layer , as expected , given the irradiation level from the host star .",
    "a model with solar - abundance composition explains the 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath1mplanet - star flux contrast ; however , including the high 3.6 @xmath1mflux contrast requires models that output nearly 20% of the orbit - averaged incident irradiation , independent of the atmospheric composition .",
    "if the orbit were circular ( and thus the irradiation steady - state ) , the high brightness temperatures would indicate a very low energy redistribution to the night side of the planet .",
    "for an eccentric planet , it at least indicates a short @xmath40 ( figure [ fig : model ] ) .    by modeling the orbital thermal variations due to the eccentricity of the orbit",
    ", we determined that it is possible for wasp-8b to achieve temperatures as high as the 3.6 @xmath1 m  brightness temperature .",
    "however , the differing brightness temperatures in the other two bands remain puzzling .",
    "neither the radiative - transfer model ( section [ sec : atmosphere ] ) nor the phase - variation model ( section [ sec : discussion ] ) embraces all the physics of the problem .",
    "the radiative transfer code is a 1d , steady - state model representing typical dayside conditions .",
    "the phase - variation model describes emission as a blackbody on a single - layer grid ; it does not consider absorption or emission features from the species in the atmosphere .",
    "clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , atmospheric dynamics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and photochemistry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are not directly considered by these models .",
    "what we can say for certain is that the assumptions of our simple models have been violated , which is not surprising for this eccentric planet . while it may be possible to construct consistent , realistic models",
    ", model uniqueness may be elusive until more and better data are available .",
    "relatively few exoplanets with equilibrium temperatures below 1500  k have been observed at secondary eclipse @xcite . the same is true for eccentric planets .",
    "the characterization of wasp-8b in this work thus addresses a particularly interesting , and challenging , region of the exoplanet phase space .",
