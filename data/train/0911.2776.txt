    "over the last decade , deep and wide multiwavelength galaxy surveys have been key in addressing critical issues regarding galaxy evolution . by using a variety of color selection techniques , and deriving photometric and/or spectroscopic redshifts ,",
    "different galaxy populations have now been probed to unprecedented detail up to at least @xmath6 . also ,",
    "the history of cosmic star formation as well as the corresponding build  up of stellar mass has now been constrained using different observational approaches .",
    "less well understood are the physical processes that regulate the star formation activity in these young systems and the question of if and how galaxy star formation at high redshift differs from what is seen in the local universe . while it has been established that star formation rates ( sfrs ) in galaxies were on average higher in the past and that the cosmic sfr density peaked at @xmath5 ( see , e.g. , leborgne et al .",
    "2009 ) , it is still a matter of debate how much of this increase is due to more frequent merging / interactions between galaxies , or other processes .",
    "analysis of the ultraviolet ( uv ) and optical rest frame morphology and h@xmath7 velocity fields of high redshift galaxies suggest that the galaxies responsible for the bulk of the sfr density at @xmath8  to  3 are disks ( e.g. , bell et al .",
    "2005 ; elbaz et al . 2007 ; genzel et al .",
    "these findings confirmed early hints for the presence of extended disks at high redshift , based on damped ly@xmath7 studies ( e.g. , wolfe et al .",
    "some authors , however , advocate a predominant role of mergers based on , e.g. , irregularities in high signal to noise ( s / n ) 3d observations of emission lines ( e.g. , flores et al . 2006 ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is also found that distant star forming galaxies show irregular morphologies with high clumpiness , especially in the rest - frame uv ( e.g. , cowie et al .",
    "1996 ; chapman et al .",
    "2003 ; daddi et al . 2004 ; elmegreen & elmegreen 2005 ) . in this context",
    "it is interesing to note that the existence of such bright clumps can explain the observed kinematic irregularities in high  z galaxies ( i.e. , without the need to require the presence of mergers , immeli et al .",
    "2004 ; bournaud et al .",
    "more direct evidence for an important role of in situ , quiescent star formation in distant galaxies came from the estimate that the duty cycle of star formation is high in massive @xmath9 galaxies ( daddi et al .",
    "2005 ; 2007a ; see also caputi et al .",
    "2008 ) , with typical durations of @xmath101  gyr .",
    "this is much longer than the typical duration expected for starbursts ( @xmath11  myr ) triggered by mergers , based on simulations ( e.g. , mihos & hernquist 1996 ; di  matteo et al . 2008 ) and also on the observed gas consumption timescales for ir luminous merging galaxies ( e.g. , downes & solomon 1998 ) .",
    "a recent major step forward in characterizing the nature of star formation in distant galaxies was based on the discovery that star forming galaxies define a narrow locus in the stellar mass - sfr plane ( in this paper we will refer to the ratio of sfr to stellar mass as the specific sfr , ssfr ) .",
    "this correlation has been estimated to have a slope of 0.71.0 in log space and a dispersion of a factor of only @xmath02 from redshifts @xmath12 to @xmath13 ( noeske et al .",
    "2007 ; elbaz et al . 2007",
    "; daddi et al . 2007a ; magdis et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the normalization in this correlation , i.e. the ssfr at a given stellar mass , is higher by a factor of 30 at @xmath143 compared to the local universe . at even higher redshifts",
    "the situation is unclear as the sfrs are typically less well constrained ( as they are primarily based on uv luminosities ) .",
    "however , the available data is still consistent with the picture that the correlation extends to earlier epochs ( @xmath15 ) with a normalization similar to that seen at @xmath14 ( daddi et al . 2009",
    "; stark et al . 2009 , gonzales et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the existence of this correlation has major implications for our understanding of galaxy formation .",
    "for example , the cosmic evolution of the normalization of the relation ( daddi et al . 2009 ; pannella et al .",
    "2009 ; gonzales et al .",
    "2009 ) is similar to the cosmic evolution of the sfrd ( hopkins & beacom 2006 ; 2008 ; le borgne et al .",
    "2009 , etc ) .",
    "it is possible in fact to describe most of the sfrd evolution as the combined result of the evolution of the stellar mass - sfr correlation and that of the space densities ( e.g. , the mass / luminosity functions ) of galaxies .",
    "the possible peak at @xmath163 ( pannella et al .",
    "2009 ; magdis et al .",
    "2009 ; daddi et al .",
    "2009a ) of the ssfrs is thus likely more fundamentally related to the physics underlying galaxy formation than the peak at @xmath5 of the sfrd evolution , as it is hinting at a change in the physical processes that regulate star formation .",
    "the remarkable tightness of this relation implies a very high degree of homogeneity in these galaxies . in other words , despite the physical complexity of the process by which stars are formed , for a normal , near - ir selected star forming galaxy , the star formation rate is ultimately linked to its stellar mass ( which in itself is presumably related to the mass of the underlying dark matter halo ) .                    in order to make further progress in understanding how galaxy formation proceeds in distant galaxies , and to shed light on the origin of the stellar mass - sfr correlations , we need to start probing the properties of molecular gas reservoirs in these galaxies ,",
    "since it is the molecular gas out of which stars form .",
    "if the assembly of galaxies is mostly driven by mergers , one would expect most star formation in merger - driven starbursts with concentrated gas cores ( like in submm galaxies ) and very efficient star formation , and much less molecular gas and star formation in regular objects . if , on the other hand , most star formation is due to smooth gas flows , then star formation would predominantly take place in more quiescent disk galaxies , accreting gas from their surrounding medium .",
    "in addition , one could speculate that the tightness in the stellar mass - sfr correlation might be pointing to homogeneous properties of the molecular gas reservoirs and star formation modes inside the galaxy populations .",
    "the increase in the normalization of this correlation with cosmic lookback time could then possibly be simply linked to an increase of the average gas fractions in galaxies , as well as in the ratio of the molecular ( h@xmath17 ) over the atomic ( hi ) hydrogen fraction ( see , e.g. , obreschkow & rawlings 2009 ) .",
    "the presence of massive gas reservoirs seem to be a major requirement for justifying high sfrs , with the lack thereof possibly supporting instead the need for changes in the initial stellar mass function ( imf ) .",
    "recently , we reported the detection of large molecular gas reservoirs in two near - ir selected massive galaxies at @xmath4 ( daddi et al.2008 ) .",
    "based on the knowledge available at the time , i.e. , the previously known empirical correlation between co line luminosity ( @xmath18 ) and total ir luminosity ( @xmath19 ) those galaxies should not have been detected in co. however , observations were still attempted based on the results of daddi et al .",
    "( 2005 ; 2007 ) that suggested a high duty cycle and long duration for star formation in massive high-@xmath20 galaxies .",
    "the subsequent detections of co[2 - 1 ] emission indeed implied low star formation efficiencies ( @xmath21 , defined as the ratio @xmath22 ) .",
    "these sfes are similar to what is seen in local spirals and much lower than previously seen in high redshift galaxies .",
    "subsequent studies revealed low - excitation co [ 3 - 2 ] to [ 2 - 1 ] line ratios in these galaxies ( dannerbauer et al . 2009 ) that are more typical of local spirals .    given that both galaxies were detected in co , this early result suggested commonplace large molecular gas reservoirs in distant massive galaxies ( daddi et al .",
    "however , improved statistics would clearly be needed in order to formally confirm the result and to estimate the variations in gas properties among the high-@xmath20 galaxy populations .",
    "higher spatial resolution observations are further required to constrain the sizes of the molecular emission ; i.e. , given the low sfes one would expect extended reservoirs rather than the compact emission lines seen in submm selected galaxies ( smgs ) for which tacconi et al .",
    "( 2006 ; 2008 ) find typically half light radii of order 2  kpc .",
    "in this paper we report on low - resolution ( d - configuration ) observations with the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) of co[2 - 1 ] ( redshifted to 3 mm ) in four additional bzks ( near - ir selected galaxies at @xmath4 ) thus tripling the number of sources in our sample .",
    "in addition , we report on higher resolution ( @xmath231.5@xmath24 ; b - configuration ) observations of four galaxies .",

    "we thus observe a very strong evolution in the gas fractions of disks at fixed stellar mass . assuming that most of the gas within @xmath72 in bzk galaxies is molecular , this corresponds to an average increase of molecular gas content of a factor of 18 , at fixed stellar mass , from @xmath80 to 1.5 .",
    "this is very similar to the increase of the ssfr ( or the normalization of the stellar mass - sfr relation ) between @xmath80 and 1.5 .",
    "hence the increase in ssfr can be consistently explained by the increase of molecular gas content inside star forming galaxies .",
    "dividing the gas masses by the sfrs we estimate gas consumption timescales in the range of 0.30.8  gyr .",
    "the sfrs can in principle continue for even longer timescales , once accounting for gas accretion .",

    "however , we should investigate if there are issues that could have led to an overestimation of the conversion factor .",
    "a first possible issue deals with systematics in the derivation of the dynamical masses .",
    "our analysis is calibrated on clumpy disk numerical modeling , which seems well justified given that our sources are observed to be highly clumpy . if we were to neglect the factor of 1.3 in eq .",
    "[ eq : mdyn ] , the combined constraint on @xmath38 would get smaller , but still 3 times higher than the ulirg - like value . nevertheless , this correction factor is unlikely to be a numerical artifact , as it is theoretically justified from the high velocity dispersions observed in high - redshift gas disks ( burkert et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "if we interpreted our sources as merging galaxies rather than clumpy disks , the implied dynamical masses would have grown even higher ( see , e.g. , tacconi et al .",
    "2008 ) , and so would the conversion factor",
    ".    we might also consider systematic effects in the determination of the stellar mass .",
    "we have used a bottom - light imf that is the best choice according to observations in the local universe ( chabrier 2003 ; see also kroupa et al .",
    "several authors have suggested that more top - heavy imfs might be appropriate in the distant universe ( dav 2008 ; van dokkum 2008 ) , which would further decrease the estimated stellar masses and hence increase the conversion factor .",
    "there remains the possibility that these galaxies could contain large reservoirs of old stars , formed at very high redshifts , that could be missed because the light is dominated by young stars . in practice , we would need to postulate hidden stellar mass reservoirs that should increase the total stellar masses by factors of 23 in order to bring our estimate of @xmath38 to the ulirg - like level .",
    "however , here we use observations up to the near - ir rest - frame ( from irac ) that should correctly retrieve the masses of old stars without such a strong bias .",
    "also , these putative old stellar reservoirs would most likely be in bulges and halos , which actually can _ not _",
    "contain most of the stellar mass around @xmath106 disks according to the modeling of bournaud & elmegreen ( 2009 ) .",
    "in addition , the existence of the stellar mass - sfr correlations suggests that the appropriate star formation histories for high redshift galaxies have sfrs that are rising rapidly with time ( e.g. , renzini 2009 ) so that the galaxies that we observe formed most of their stars quite recently .",
    "another assumption that we have made is a dark matter fraction of 25% inside the effective radius .",
    "there is of course a plausible range around this value .",

    "thus , our choice of 25% lies on the conservative side of the plausible range .",

    "[ fig : both_plot_6co ] , smgs typically also have depletion timescales of @xmath114100myr .      the fact that we are presumably looking at non - interacting rotating disks instead of on - going mergers does not in itself imply that these massive disks were not assembled by past mergers .",
    "remnants of major mergers can have massive rotating gas disks , especially when the gas fraction is high ( e.g. , robertson & bullock 2008 ) .",
    "numerical models predict that , under some physical assumptions , merger remnants can contain extended gas disks ( e.g. hopkins et al .",
    "however , bournaud & elmegreen ( 2009 ) argued that the overall spatial distribution of the mass in high - redshift disks is inconsistent with the majority of them being merger remnants , suggesting that their mass assembly was dominated by relatively smooth mass infall along gas streams ( see also dekel et al .",
    "this is because the morphology of these disk galaxies , in particular their supermassive star - forming clumps , can not be accounted for if the main assembly channel is by mergers .",
    "our co observations add further support to this picture .",

    "if major mergers played a role in the formation of @xmath64 bzk galaxies , their large molecular disks must have been replenished by the smooth infall of baryons at a rate higher than the merger - driven mass assembly in order to keep extended gas disks .",

    "2006 ) . most of the observed properties of the two classes can be understood within this scheme : there is a population of disk galaxies having low excitation co , spatially extended gas reservoirs , low sfe ( and hence long gas consumption timescales ) , low ssfr and optically thin uv emission .",
    "these are the familiar spirals in the local universe , and likely most of the near - ir ( or optical ) selected disk galaxies in the distant universe .",
    "conversely , there are galaxy populations with opposite properties : high co excitation , compact gas reservoirs , high sfe , high ssfr and with optically thick uv emission .",
    "these are the local ulirgs and high redshift smgs , both classes likely corresponding to major ( wet ) mergers of massive star forming galaxies .      based on our results of a remarkably low scatter in observed sfe and gas fractions for the co - detected bzk galaxies , we suggest that the molecular gas content plays an important role in driving the tight stellar mass - sfr correlation in high redshift sources .",
    "a simple scenario may be that the gas properties are tightly connected to that of the underlying dark matter halo , possibly via the regulation of cold gas accretion rates through cosmic times ( e.g. , keres et al . 2005 ; see also bouch et al .",
    "this in turn could regulate the amount of star formation in each halo and its time integral , i.e. the stellar mass , which , as a result , are tightly connected . ultimately , there might be a stellar mass - sfr correlation because the gas content of galaxies tightly correlates with the masses of hosting dark matter halos over cosmological timescales .",

    "this is probably one of the rare cases where models of galaxy formation have preceded observations , showing truly predictive power . also , such models had qualitatively predicted an increase in the normalization of the correlation toward higher redshifts .",
    "however , existing models fail in reproducing the actual magnitude of the normalization increase to @xmath9 ( falling short by factors of 35 compared to observational estimates ; see e.g. daddi et al .",

    "the sfrs estimated for distant galaxies are generally too high compared to the prediction of models , a fact that has been long known for smgs ( bough et al .",
    "dav ( 2008 ) suggest that this discrepancy between models and observations can be solved by adopting substantial evolution in the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",

    "however , new theoretical frameworks have recently been proposed in which feeding of star formation through cold flow filaments ( dekel et al . 2009a ; see also keres et al .",
    "2005 ) can more easily justify high star formation rates in distant galaxies .",
    "in addition , we have also found large gas reservoirs , reaching @xmath115 in some cases , i.e. the gas accounts for a major fraction of the baryons in these sources .",
    "we are thus witnessing a phase in galaxy formation in which massive galaxies were truly gas  dominated systems .",

    "<S> we present evidence for very high gas fractions and extended molecular gas reservoirs in normal , near - infrared selected ( bzk ) galaxies at z@xmath01.5 . </S>",
    "<S> our results are based on multi - configuration co[2 - 1 ] observations obtained at the iram plateau de bure interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> all six star forming galaxies observed were detected at high significance . </S>",
    "<S> high spatial resolution observations resolve the co emission in four of them , implying sizes of the gas reservoirs of order of 611  kpc and suggesting the presence of ordered rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxies have uv morphologies consistent with clumpy , unstable disks , and uv sizes that are consistent with those measured in co. the star formation efficiencies are homogeneously low within the sample and similar to those of local spirals  the resulting gas depletion times are @xmath1  gyr , much higher than what is seen in high - z submm galaxies and quasars . </S>",
    "<S> the co luminosities can be predicted to within 0.15  dex from the observed star formation rates and stellar masses , implying a tight correlation of the gas mass with these quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we use new dynamical models of clumpy disk galaxies to derive dynamical masses for our sample . </S>",
    "<S> these models are able to reproduce the peculiar spectral line shapes of the co emission . after accounting for the stellar and dark matter masses </S>",
    "<S> we derive molecular gas reservoirs with masses of 0.41.2@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the implied conversion ( co luminosity - to - gas mass ) factor is very high : @xmath3 , consistent with a galactic conversion factor but four times higher than that of local ultra - luminous ir galaxies that is typically used for high - redshift objects . </S>",
    "<S> the gas mass in these galaxies is comparable to or larger than the stellar mass , and the gas accounts for an impressive 5065% of the baryons within the galaxies half light radii . </S>",
    "<S> we are thus witnessing truly gas - dominated galaxies at @xmath4 , a finding that explains the high specific sfrs observed for @xmath5 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the bzk galaxies can be viewed as scaled - up versions of local disk galaxies , with low efficiency star formation taking place inside extended , low excitation gas disks . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies are markedly different than local ulirgs and high - z submm galaxies and quasars , where higher excitation and more compact gas is found . </S>"
