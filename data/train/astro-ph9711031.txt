    "star formation ( sf ) is a fundamental process in the evolution of galaxies . but this process is far from being well understood .",
    "the sf is usually characterized by the initial mass function ( imf ) and the total sf rate ( sfr ) , which depends on many factors such as the density of the interstellar gas , its morphology , its metallicity , _ etc .",
    "_    according to larson ( 1987 ) , four major factors drive star formation in galaxies : large scale gravitational instabilities , cloud compression by density waves , compression in a rotating galactic disk due to shear forces , and random cloud collisions . in galaxies with previous stellar generations ,",
    "additional sf triggers exist , such as shock waves from stellar winds and supernova explosions . in dense environments , such as clusters of galaxies and compact groups , tidal interactions and collisions with other galaxies",
    "probably play some role in triggering star formation ( _ e.g. , _ the blue compact dwarf and the i m galaxies apparently formed at the ends of the tidal tails of arp 105 : duc and mirabel 1994 ) .",
    "while `` global''phenomena , such as the first two sf triggers of larson ( 1987 ) , play a large part in grand design spirals , random collisions of interstellar clouds may provide the best explanation for dwarf galaxies with bursts of sf .",
    "therefore , understanding sf in dwarf galaxies should be simpler than in other types of galaxies .",
    "understanding this type of objects has also cosmological implications , as some star forming dwarf galaxies may be genuinely young .",
    "one way to derive the star formation history of galaxies is with a combination of credible spectral synthesis models and observations in as many spectral bands as possible , which should provide constraints on the imf .",
    "this approach is usually followed for a sample of galaxies of similar type , in which the star formation parameters would be basically similar .",
    "surface photometry in broad - bands , from which the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is derived , together with a tracer of massive stars , such as h@xmath0 or uv measurements , makes it possible to obtain the total ongoing sfr .",
    "the h@xmath0 radiation is directly coupled to the radiation at wavelengths @xmath1912 ( _ e.g. _ , kennicutt 1983 ) , indicating the ongoing star formation .",
    "uv radiation longward of the lyman break , mainly emission detected by space experiments such as iue and hst , which is longward of lyman @xmath0 , is produced not only by the most massive stars , but also by cooler stars that do not ionize hydrogen significantly .",
    "almoznino ( 1995 ) studied a sample of bcds in the virgo cluster selected from the binggeli , sandage , and tamman ( 1985 , hereafter bst ) catalog , with hi measurements from hoffman ( 1987 , 1989a ) . among the objects in his sample he found one exceptional object , vcc 144 , which could be a truly young galaxy . here",
    "we describe our observations of this object , combine them with existing information , compare them with evolutionary population synthesis models , and present our interpretation .",
    "the virgo cluster contains a very unusual object ( hi 1225 + 01 ) , discovered serendipitously by giovanelli & haynes ( 1989 ) as an extragalactic hi cloud within the cluster .",
    "subsequently , an optical counterpart was identified ( _ e.g. , _",
    "djorgovski 1990 ) , was studied by salzer ( 1991 ) , and was recently mapped in hi with the vla ( chengalur 1995 ) .",
    "salzer showed it to be a system which witnessed a burst of star formation @xmath21 gyr ago , with signs of a recent ( @xmath210 myr ) second burst .",
    "chengalur ( 1995 ) found rotation in the hi distribution and identified the star - forming clump as the only region where the hi surface density exceeds 4.6 10@xmath3 atoms @xmath4 .",
    "the system is probably the result of a tidal interaction between two hi components .",
    "a general review of properties of dwarf galaxies was given by thuan ( 1992 ) and a review of spectroscopic properties of star - forming dwarfs was presented by vlchez ( 1995 ) .",
    "lately , a number of papers reported extended hi envelopes , or hi companions , of dwarf galaxies ( _ e.g. , _",
    "taylor 1995 ; van zee 1995 ; hoffman 1996 ; szomoru 1996a , 1996b ) .",
    "as will be seen below , we detected an extended hi envelope connected with vcc 144 .",
    "it is possible that this object represents a more intensely star - forming case than hi 1225 + 01 and that dwarf galaxies with extended hi distributions have other common characteristics .",
    "therefore , we will compare our measurements and derived properties for this virgo bcd with those of the optical counterparts of the dwarf galaxies with extended hi and with hi 1225 + 01 .",
    "below we first review published observations of vcc 144 and describe our own observations together with additional data collected from the literature or data banks .",
    "we adopt here a uniform distance of 18 mpc to the virgo cluster , and by inference to all its members , including vcc 144 .",
    "a smaller cluster distance , @xmath5 mpc , is suggested by the [ oiii ] distances to planetary nebulae ( jacoby 1990 ) , but visvanathan & griersmith ( 1979 ) give 17.9 mpc , in agreement with sandage & tammann ( 1974 ) .",
    "we note other values for the distance to the virgo cluster , in particular 16.8 mpc ( tully 1988 ) and the estimate of the distance to m100 from observations of cepheids ( 17.1 mpc : freedman 1995 ) , while considering the depth of the cluster to be some 3 - 4 mpc .",
    "note that vcc 144 could be located in the w cloud ( hoffman 1989b ) .",
    "if this is the case , its distance could be 1.7 to 2 times greater than adopted here .",

    "three 20 min exposures were obtained through each of the two filters .",

    "the spectrum was obtained through the iue large aperture with the short wavelength primary camera in low dispersion setup .",
    "vcc 144 is a very compact object , and the radiation comes almost entirely from its central 10 \" , thus iue collected essentially all of its uv flux .",
    "the iue spectrum ( swp 46761 ) was very weak after its extraction .",
    "we measured two regions 100 wide and averaged the flux densities within each to obtain two uv photometric indices at 1350 and at 1850 .",

    "the profile is triangular - shaped , asymmetric , and shows no sign of a two - horn profile expected for a flat rotation curve .",
    "while a solid - body rotation curve can give rise to a triangular profile ( skillman 1996 ) , it is unusual to find evidence of significant rotation in dwarf galaxies which exhibit triangular central beam profiles as narrow as this one ( hoffman 1996 ) .",

    "continuum observations were conducted with 50 mhz bandpasses at 6 and 20 cm .",
    "calibration was performed using sources from the vla calibrator list in the usual way , with map - making and deconvolution performed using the standard routine imagr within the nrao aips software package . for the hi data , the continuum was subtracted in the @xmath31 domain , and zero - spacing fluxes",
    "were interpolated for each channel from the arecibo spectrum .",
    "the rms noise achieved after cleaning was 0.21 mjy / beam for the l band continuum data , 0.053 mjy / beam for the c band data , and 2.0 mjy / beam in each channel for the hi line data .",
    "we measured for vcc 144 the following integrated photometric properties : v=14.83@xmath140.03 , ( b  v)=0.46@xmath140.03 , ( v  r)=0.22@xmath140.02 , and ( r  i)=0.23@xmath140.02 .",
    "the photometry was performed through a polygonal aperture , which traced the `` limits '' of the galaxy as estimated visually on the deepest ( v - band ) image .",
    "this corresponds to a surface brightness of @xmath225.5 mag / square arcsec .",
    "this rather shallow limit is the result of the low exposure collected for vcc 144 , which is one of the brightest galaxies in our sample .",
    "although the v magnitude we measure reproduces that by gh86 , there is a possible discrepancy in the b band , as the color ( b  v ) is marginally redder ( 2@xmath32 ) than what they measured . the difference could be related to a radial color gradient in the galaxy , as gh86 measured only the innermost 19 `` while we include an additional @xmath210 '' external region .",
    "however , a test of the image profiles in the b , v , and r bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , below ) shows that they are @xmath2identical , thus vcc 144 is _ not _ redder in its outer regions . with the measured photometry , and an adopted distance of 18 mpc to the virgo cluster",
    ", vcc 144 appears to be a low luminosity dwarf galaxy ( m@xmath3316.4 ) .",
    "if in cloud w , as mentioned above and @xmath34 further away , m@xmath3317.6 mag , it would still be a dwarf galaxy , although on the brighter side .",
    "the h@xmath0 frames were combined and the final image was shifted to match the broad - band images , and the galaxy was measured inside the same polygonal area used for its broad - band image .",
    "the method of measurement was basically the same as for the broad - band frames , with the exception that the sky background level was computed several times using different boxes around the objects ( see almoznino 1993 ) .",
    "the mean of these results was adopted as the object counts , while the error was taken as the largest of the errors of each measurement .",
    "the standard deviation of the results was smaller than this .",
    "the integrated h@xmath0 flux was measured to be 7.05@xmath140.76 10@xmath20 erg s@xmath15 @xmath4 .",
    "the average line equivalent width , obtained by dividing the net line image by the off - line continuum image , is 159@xmath1422 , with a peak value of 390 .",
    "the intense h@xmath0 emission implies that @xmath213% of the r band photons originate from this line and from [ nii ] emission .",
    "we have not corrected the magnitudes and colors for line emission , either for h@xmath0+[nii ] in r , for [ oiii ] in v , or for [ oii ] in u. the contribution of line emission is strongest in the r band ; the other lines have smaller equivalent width and are located near the edges of bands .",
    "we smoothed all final images , combined from different images through the same filter , with a gaussian of full width at half - maximum of 4 pixels=3``.5 , which corresponds to the typical seeing in our images .",
    "we then obtained an intensity profile for each image , by fitting ellipses to the isophotes .",
    "the intensity profiles for the b , v , r , and i bands , as well as that for the net - h@xmath0 image , were scaled to the same peak intensity ( of the b image ) , and the widths of the profiles were compared .",
    "we found that all five images had virtually identical profiles , to within 5% of the peak intensity at @xmath212 pixels@xmath2411 '' galactocentric distance .",
    "the intensity profiles are plotted in fig .",
    "the images are all resolved , with very similar eccentricities of @xmath20.6 in all colors .",
    "the surface brightness is high with an average value of @xmath35=20.5 mag/@xmath36 \" .",
    "note that because of the smoothing , there are only very few `` independent '' points , thus fitting the light distribution to any of the usual profiles seems pointless .",
    "the high surface brightness , the strong h@xmath0 emission , and the compact and blue appearance of the galaxy point to an interpretation favoring a strong burst of star formation taking place at present in vcc 144 .",
    "we did not find any faint extensions or disturbances in our images ; thus the triggering of star formation in vcc 144 can not be attributed to a recent interaction with another visible galaxy . both vla continuum images ( figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] ) show a single gaussian feature centered on the optical image of the galaxy . at 20 cm ,",
    "the feature has a size @xmath37 after deconvolution with the @xmath38 beam .",
    "the peak intensity of a fitted gaussian is @xmath39 mjy / beam and the integrated intensity over the feature is @xmath40 mjy . at 6 cm",
    "the galaxy is still only marginally resolved ( the other features on the map are all well outside the optical and hi boundaries , and are almost certainly unrelated to vcc 144 ) , with a size about @xmath41 after deconvolution with the @xmath42 beam , a gaussian peak at @xmath43 mjy / beam and an integrated intensity of 1.78@xmath140.19 mjy .",
    "this gives a global spectral index of 0.23@xmath140.25 if the integrated intensities are used , or 0.13@xmath140.15 if the peak intensities are used instead .",
    "the 21 cm line data were processed at full resolution ( 16 `` ) and at 45 '' , to bring out extended features at lower column densities .",
    "the maps at full and at reduced resolution are presented below and are discussed in detail .    the total hi map at 16 \" resolution was computed by integrating over the emission - bearing channels with no blanking applied .",
    "the resulting contour map , overlaid on a grey scale version of the b - band image , is shown in fig .  [ fig4 ] and reveals one concentration of about @xmath44 coincident in position with the optical image , with hints of more diffuse emission extending perhaps one beam width to the southwest , and about 1.5 arcmin to the northeast .    to confirm that the extension is real",
    ", we convolved the map with a gaussian to smooth it to a resolution of 45 arcsec .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , and the ne extension stands out clearly .",
    "in fact , the two figures show that the hi distribution extends on both sides of the minor axis of the galaxy .",
    "integrating over the entire hi distribution gives a total mass of @xmath45 , about 50% larger than the flux estimated from the single - beam spectrum obtained with the arecibo telescope , which partially resolves the hi cloud .",
    "our images and inspection of the palomar sky survey copies show no optical counterpart within the ne extension to a surface brightness limit of @xmath224 mag / square arcsec .",
    "the hi linear extent is about 11.5 kpc .",
    "all masses are appropriate to a distance of 18 mpc as assumed throughout , and would be larger by a factor of @xmath46 if vcc 144 were at the w cloud distance .    to obtain isovelocity contours at 16 \" resolution it was necessary to blank the cube in two stages : first everything outside the lowest contour on the smoothed total hi map ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , presumably unrelated to vcc 144 , was blanked .",
    "then only features in each channel that exceeded 2 mjy / beam were retained for computation of the first moment map , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .    a 45 \" resolution",
    "first moment map was also produced , retaining only features in each channel of the spatially smoothed cube that exceeded 5 mjy / beam .",
    "everything outside the lowest contour on the smoothed total hi map was then blanked from the smoothed first moment map , which is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig6 ] and  [ fig7 ] , and the individual channel maps shown in figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] and  [ fig9 ] as mosaics , leads us to the following interpretation : the dominant clump , centered on the optical image , has a mean velocity around 2010 km @xmath30 with a roughly gaussian velocity profile of width about 80 km @xmath30 .",
    "the ne extension lies generally at higher velocity , but has a more complex velocity profile with prominent narrow features at about 2070 , 2040 and 1980 km @xmath30 .",
    "this suggests some bulk motion of the diffuse gas with respect to the main concentration , but we can not say conclusively from these observations whether that motion is more properly described as infall , ejection , or rotational motion . other considerations , to be discussed below , lead us to favor a gas blow - out .",
    "we do not have adequate signal nor spatial resolution to determine whether the main concentration rotates about its own axis , or has purely turbulent internal motions . in any case ,",
    "turbulent motions appear to be at least as significant as ordered motions in the dynamics of the clump and of the system as a whole .",
    "we estimate here a representative total dynamical mass for the system , and masses of its different components ( stars , gas , and dust ) .",
    "dwarf irregular galaxies often show little rotation and their dynamics are dominated by turbulent motions ( _ e.g. , _ sargent 1983 ) .",
    "it is possible to estimate an indicative gravitational mass m@xmath47 for the galaxy using the half - width at half - intensity of the single beam 21 cm profile @xmath48 : @xmath49 for a typical hi maximal extent from the center of the hi distribution of r=4 kpc the gravitational mass is m@xmath47=1.56 10@xmath50 m@xmath13 .",

    "the hi mass is thus comparable with the stellar mass , as derived from the blue luminosity for a m / l@xmath541 assumption , but is only @xmath220% of the indicative dynamical mass .    the location of vcc 144 in a fir color - color diagram , such as that by helou ( 1986 ) , coincides with that of starburst , bcd , and extragalactic hii region galaxies , and the exact location of the point indicates that most fir emission is produced by the current star formation , _",

    "the sed shows a steep decline with increasing wavelength , both in the uv and in the optical .",
    "since our derived sed is very sparse because of having only broad - band colors , it can not be tested against detailed spectra , but can be compared , in general , to various typical seds of different stellar populations . a comparison with the experimentally - derived spectral templates of kinney ( 1996 ) in fig .",

    "the line radiation comes from the entire galaxy and , as mentioned above , no optical extension to the galaxy is visible beyond the line emitting region even in the broad - band images .",
    "this intense h@xmath0 emission indicates a high sfr at present",
    ". the lower limit on the [ oiii ] line ratio from the gallagher & hunter ( 1989 ) spectrum indicates an electron temperature @xmath61k .",
    "the present star formation rate is estimated from the h@xmath0 , again using a relation from ght : @xmath62 this requires correcting the h@xmath0 emission for extinction . adopting our h@xmath0 flux and comparing it with the h@xmath16 from gh89",
    ", we find h@xmath0/h@xmath16=6.18 , apparently indicating a significant amount of extinction for case b recombination theory .",
    "the comparison is valid , although our h@xmath0 measurement is _ global _ while that of gh89 was taken through a 22 `` aperture , because the h@xmath0 image of vcc 144 s is @xmath63 pixels@xmath2422 '' wide , but is elongated .",
    "gh89 estimate e(b ",
    "v)@xmath540.0 from h@xmath16/h@xmath19 .",
    "the h@xmath0/h@xmath16 inconsistency , produced by two different observations , may result if gh89 missed part of the total h@xmath16 flux in their round aperture .",
    "we conclude that the extinction for vcc 144 is probably `` negligible '' , as indicated by the reasonable fit to the kinney ( 1996 ) sed .",
    "this yields sfr@xmath64=0.29 m@xmath13/yr , assuming no extinction of the h@xmath0 line .",
    "the discrepancy between sfr@xmath60 and sfr@xmath64 found above may result from an incompatibility of the model .",
    "a similar result was found for an irregular galaxy by thronson ( 1988 ) . as will be shown below",
    ", our preferred interpretation of vcc 144 is of a recent and first star formation burst .",
    "therefore , the ght method of deriving sfr@xmath60 will not be correct .",
    "a comparison with the spectral energy distribution of different young starbursts may be more adequate .",
    "the lack of heii and typical wr emission signatures indicates that high mass stars ( m@xmath6540m@xmath13 ) are missing from the present population mix , while ght assumed an upper mass cutoff of 100 m@xmath13 ; only if the sf burst happened instantaneously a few 10@xmath66 yrs ago , the most massive stars and their wr remnants could be absent now , which would explain the discrepancy between sfr@xmath60 and sfr@xmath64 .",
    "another hint about the present population of massive stars , derived from the radio continuum mapping , will be discussed below .",
    "the far - ir flux , from lonsdale ( 1985 ) , is : @xmath67 \\ , 10^{-14}\\ ] ] for vcc 144 , at the nominal distance of 18 mpc , this implies a fir luminosity of 7.6 10@xmath68 l@xmath13 , thus @xmath69=4.7 and the galaxy is not a strong fir source .",
    "the sfr in vcc 144 can also be estimated from the iras data , using the method of thronson and telesco ( 1986 ) .",
    "this assumes that essentially the entire luminosity of the massive ob stars is absorbed by the dust and is reemitted in the infrared .",
    "this yields the following relation : @xmath70 with the fir luminosity @xmath71 given in solar units and approximated by : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the distance to the object in mpc and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the two iras flux densities in jy .",
    "the sfr resulting from this method is similar to that derived from the h@xmath0 data ( @xmath20.3 m@xmath13 yr@xmath15 ) , increasing our confidence in the `` negligible extinction '' case for this galaxy and , coincidentally , in the assumption that most photons from ob stars heat the dust .",
    "it is worthwhile to consider a distance - free parameter , such as the star formation per unit galactic area .",
    "this can be derived using the size of the galaxy from its ccd image , or profile , as exhibited in fig .",
    "1 . in this case",
    ", the ongoing sfr per unit area is given by : @xmath76 where the sfr / area is in m@xmath13/yr/@xmath77 and @xmath78 is the observed h@xmath0 flux per square arcsecond .",
    "the high sfr / area value , 2.28@xmath79 , originates from the strong luminosity and compactness of the object .",
    "not surprisingly , with a high specific sf but small size vcc 144 undergoes strong star formation per unit galactic area , but shows only modest total sfr . for comparison",
    ", the milky way has a total sfr of @xmath80 and sfr / area of @xmath81 .",
    "large , active , star forming galaxies have sfr / area similar to that of vcc 144 ( _ e.g. , _ pogge and eskridge 1987 ) .",
    "thus , once the star formation activity is triggered , its intensity , as manifested by the sfr / area , is similar in small and large galaxies .",
    "this interpretation implies that mechanisms believed to be responsible for star formation in large galaxies but not in dwarf galaxies , such as compression due to density waves or from rotational shear forces , are as efficient as other mechanisms , such as random collision between clouds or gravitational instabilities caused by other effects .",
    "otherwise , there would be significantly more star formation per area in large star - forming galaxies than in late - type dwarfs .",
    "it is worth mentioning that here the _ efficiency _ of the star formation process , caused by the various mechanisms , is tested , rather than how wide - spread these mechanisms are .",
    "therefore , the conclusion at this stage is that once star formation is induced , its efficiency is approximately the same , regardless of the mechanism which induced it .",
    "the radio synthesis observations indicate that the continuum source is connected with the presence of stars , as the emission is localized in the cloud which coincides with the optical counterpart .",
    "the spectral index is consistent with thermal emission processes .",
    "the thermal radio continuum can be calculated from the physical conditions in the hii region : @xmath82 for the observations at 20 cm , with t@xmath83=1.3 10@xmath58k ( upper limit , from the [ oiii ] lines ) , with the number of ionizing photons calculated from h@xmath0 ( see below ) and at 18 mpc , s(1420 mhz)=0.9 mjy . at 5 ghz",
    "the thermal radio continuum is 0.8 mjy and makes up @xmath230% of the detected flux .",
    "the fraction of non - thermal 20 cm contribution is @xmath21.5 mjy and at 6 cm it is @xmath21.0 mjy .",
    "the resultant non - thermal spectral index is @xmath20.3 . with an average flux from a snr at 18 mpc of @xmath21 mjy",
    "there should be at present at most a couple of radio snrs in vcc 144 .",
    "this is consistent with the present number of early - type stars ; with @xmath22000 o7 stars present ( see below ) , with a lifetime to supernova explosion of @xmath210@xmath68 years and a radio snr lifetime of 10@xmath58 yrs , a couple of snrs should be detectable at present in radio continuum .",
    "above we derived a number of sfrs , which can be combined with the observationally - derived masses to yield two indicative time scales .",
    "in particular , it is possible to use the `` star formation timescale '' , defined by hodge ( 1993 ) as : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the total mass in stars , estimated with the assumption of @xmath86 , and @xmath87 is the present sfr . for vcc 144",
    "we obtain @xmath88=1.2 gyrs , similar to hodge s value for the most extreme starburst galaxy in his list .",
    "this is an indication on the production of the present - day luminosity with solar - type stars ; for an imf rich in young stars",
    "m / l is lower .",
    "mateo ( 1992 ) found one magellanic cluster with m / l@xmath540.1 for an age of 8 10@xmath68 yrs .",
    "for three magellanic clusters , elson and freeman ( 1985 ) found m / l between 0.11 and 0.56 ; if this is the case for vcc 144 , the mass in stars would be lower and @xmath88 could be @xmath89 yrs or even less .",
    "the roberts time scale measures the time to exhaust the galactic hi reservoir given the present sfr : @xmath90 we obtain for vcc 144 @xmath91=0.9 gyrs if the entire hi reservoir is considered , or 0.4 gyrs for the hi coincident with the optical image .",
    "the estimate of the roberts time scale assumes no recycling of material from the stars ; otherwise , the time to exhaust the hi will be longer for a constant sfr . for a star formation proceeding in bursts followed by long periods of quiescence",
    ", the galaxy could survive for a hubble time , provided the star formation duty cycle is @xmath542% .",
    "this constraint can be relaxed if the total hi would include the diffuse extended cloud of hydrogen .",
    "we compared our results with population synthesis models of leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) and found reasonable matches for single star burst models 5 - 7 myrs old .",
    "we emphasize that the matches are not perfect , but indicative .",
    "we tested also the h@xmath0 data through the number of ionizing photons , following osterbrock ( 1989 ) for a simple case b recombination theory and with the h@xmath0 luminosity in erg / s : @xmath92 the color index ( h@xmath0v ) for the models , for this purpose , is obtained as @xmath93=129.8 - 2.5 \\ , log(n_c)-m_v\\ ] ] we compared the observed color index [ h@xmath0v]=2.5 log [ f(h@xmath0)]v=15.56 , ( b  v ) , and m@xmath94 with the model predictions .",
    "the indices fit a @xmath26 myr old single star burst model from leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) but are not compatible with continuous star formation .",
    "these are much too blue to fit the observations . from the value of n@xmath95 found for vcc 144 , using l(h@xmath0)=2.7 10@xmath96 erg s@xmath15 and adopting a lyman continuum photon flux of 10@xmath97 s@xmath15 from a typical o star , it appears that some 2000 late - o or b stars are needed in vcc 144 at present to ionize the hydrogen . for a salpeter imf",
    ", this implies that the present star burst produced some 10@xmath66 m@xmath13 in stars of all masses .",
    "the observational and derived parameters related to vcc 144 are summarized in the table below . for comparison",
    ", we included a few `` typical '' values from the compilation of vlchez ( 1995 , v ) for star - forming dwarfs , from huchra ( 1977 , h ) for markarian galaxies , and from thuan ( 1992 , t ) for late - type dwarfs .",
    "the metallicity was derived from the [ oii]+[oiii ] lines as measured from gh89 data and it compares well with the typical metallicity found by vlchez ( 1995 ) for his sample of dwarf galaxies .",
    "we conclude that our observations , combined with data from the literature , indicate that a single , short and recent burst of star formation can account for the observed properties of this object .",

    "thus , its star forming activity could be explained , despite the object being relatively isolated .",
    "vcc 144 appears to be similarly isolated from other optical galaxies at the southern outskirts of the virgo cluster , with ngc 4197 at @xmath254 kpc projected distance as nearest neighbor , but shows a much more intense star forming activity .",
    "the bcds studied by van zee ( 1995 ) are sometimes extended in hi ( 16/41@xmath5440% of the cases ) .",
    "an extended ( @xmath109 size of the optical galaxy ) , but symmetrical , envelope was found for the nearby irregular galaxy leo i ( young & lo 1996 ) . in most cases of diffuse hi near bcds",
    "the hi extension is @xmath2symmetrical around the optical object .",

    "[ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] appear as two lobes on the extension of the galaxy minor axis .",
    "the extensions , mainly the large one to the ne , represent large amounts of kinetic energy , just from considering the mass and velocity difference with respect to the hi on the optical counterpart ( @xmath25 10@xmath110 erg ) .",
    "at least an equal amount of mechanical energy was probably injected as turbulent motion in the blown - out gas .",
    "leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) calculated a total mechanical energy injected by supernovae and stellar winds of @xmath21.6 10@xmath111 erg ( scaled to the present m@xmath94 and for an instantaneous starburst 6 10@xmath66 yrs old ) .",
