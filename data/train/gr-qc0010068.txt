    "the absence of a unique way of defining energy and momentum in general relativity has caused much debate .",
    "this subject continues to be one of the most active areas of research in general relativity . in spite of many attempts aimed at obtaining an adequate expression for local or quasi - local energy and momentum",
    ", there is still no generally accepted definition known .",
    "this has resulted in diverse viewpoints on this subject . in a series of papers ,",
    "cooperstock @xcite hypothesized that in general relativity energy and momentum are located only to the regions of nonvanishing energy - momentum tensor and consequently the gravitational waves are not carriers of energy and momentum .",
    "this hypothesis has neither been proved nor disproved . since the advent of",
    "einstein s energy - momentum complex , used for calculating energy and momentum in a general relativistic system , many energy - momentum complexes have been found , for instance , landau and lifshitz , papapetrou , and weinberg ( see in @xcite and also references therein ) .",
    "the major difficulty with these definitions is that they are coordinate - dependent , with the computations of energy and momentum only giving meaningful results if calculations are carried out in `` cartesian coordinates '' .",
    "this motivated mller @xcite to construct an expression which enables one to evaluate energy in any coordinate system . however , mller s energy - momentum complex suffered some criticism ( see @xcite ) .",
    "over the past two decades a large number of definitions of quasi - local mass ( associated with a closed two - surface ) have been proposed ( see in @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "though penrose@xcite pointed out that a quasi - local mass is conceptually important , a serious problem with the known quasi - local mass definitions is that these do not comply even for the reissner - nordstrm and kerr space - times@xcite .",
    "moreover , the seminal quasi - local mass definition of penrose is not adequate to handle the kerr metric@xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "several energy - momentum complexes have been showing a high degree of consistency in giving the same and acceptable energy and momentum distribution for a given space - time .",
    "this has been found for many asymptotically flat@xcite as well as asymptotically non - flat space - times@xcite .",
    "recently virbhadra@xcite investigated whether or not the energy - momentum complexes of einstein , landau and lifshitz , papapetrou , and weinberg give the same energy distribution for the most general nonstatic spherically symmetric metric , and to a great surprise he found that these definitions disagree .",
    "he noted that the energy - momentum complex of einstein furnished a consistent result for the schwarzschild metric whether one calculates in kerr - schild cartesian coordinates or schwarzschild cartesian coordinates .",
    "the definitions of ll , papapetrou and weinberg give the same result as in the einstein prescription if computations are performed in kerr - schild cartesian coordinates ; however , they disagree with the einstein definition if computations are done in schwarzschild cartesian coordinates .",
    "thus , the definitions of ll , papapetrou and weinberg do not furnish a consistent result .",
    "based on this and some other investigations , virbhadra remarked that the einstein method is the best among all known ( including quasi - local mass definitions ) for energy distribution in a space - time . recently in an important paper lessner@xcite argued that the mller energy - momentum expression is a powerful concept of energy and momentum in general relativity .",
    "so in the present paper we wish to revisit the mller energy - momentum expression and use it to compute the energy distribution in the most general nonstatic spherically symmetric space - time and compare this result with one obtained by virbhadra in the einstein prescription . throughout this paper",
    "we use @xmath0 units and follow the convention that latin indices take values from @xmath1 to @xmath2 and greek indices take values from @xmath3 to @xmath2 .",
    "virbhadra@xcite explored the energy distribution in the most general nonstatic spherically symmetric space - time .",
    "he used the energy - momentum complex of einstein .",
    "the most general nonstatic spherically symmetric space - time is described by the line element @xmath4 this has , amongst others , the following well - known space - times as special cases : the schwarzschild metric , reissner - nordstrm metric , vaidya metric , janis - newman - winicour metric , garfinkle - horowitz - strominger metric , a general non - static spherically symmetric metric of the kerr - schild class ( discussed in virbhadra s paper@xcite ) .",
    "the einstein energy - momentum complex is given as @xmath5 where @xmath6_{,m } \\ .\\ ] ] @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote for the energy and momentum density components , respectively .",
    "( virbhadra@xcite mentioned that though the energy - momentum complex found by tolman differs in form from the einstein energy - momentum complex , both are equivalent in import . )",
    "the energy - momentum components are expressed by @xmath9 further gauss s theorem furnishes @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the outward unit normal vector over the infinitesimal surface element @xmath12 . @xmath13 give momentum components @xmath14 and @xmath15 gives the energy .",
    "virbhadra transformed the line element @xmath16 to `` cartesian coordinates '' @xmath17 using @xmath18 and @xmath19 remaining the same and then used the einstein energy - momentum complex to obtain the energy distribution , which is given below .",
    "@xmath20 }             { 2 \\sqrt{\\alpha \\beta+\\gamma^2}}. \\label{eeinst}\\ ] ] in the next section we obtain the energy distribution for the same metric in mller s formulation .",
    "in this section we first write the energy - momentum complex of mller and then use this for the most general nonstatic spherically symmetric metric given by the equation @xmath16 .",
    "note that as the mller complex is not restricted to the use of `` cartesian coordinates '' we perform the computations in @xmath21 coordinates , because computations in these coordinates are easier compared to those in @xmath22 coordinates .",
    "the following is the mller energy - momentum complex @xmath23 @xcite : @xmath24 which satisfy the local conservation laws : @xmath25 the antisymmetric superpotential @xmath26 is @xmath27   g^{km } g^{nl}\\text { \\ . }",

    "further gauss s theorem furnishes the energy @xmath32 given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the outward unit normal vector over an infinitesimal surface element @xmath12 .",
    "for the line element @xmath16 under consideration we calculate @xmath35 which is the only required component of @xmath36 for our purpose .    using the above expression in equation @xmath37",
    "we obtain the energy distribution @xmath38 it is evident that the energy distribution for the most general nonstatic spherically symmetric metric the definitions of einstein and mller disagree in general ( compare @xmath39 with @xmath40 ) .",
    "however , these furnish the same results for some space - times , for instance , the schwarzschild and vaidya space - times@xcite .",
    "in the next section we will compute energy distribution in a few space - times using @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "in this section we discuss a few examples of space - times in the einstein as well as the mller prescriptions .    1 .",
    "* the schwarzschild solution * + this solution is expressed by the line element @xmath41 equations @xmath39 and @xmath40 furnish ( see also in @xcite ) @xmath42 showing that these two definitions of energy distribution agree for the schwarzschild space - time .",

    "for @xmath53 this solution furnishes the schwarzschild solution .",
    "+ virbhadra@xcite computed the energy expression for this metric using the eq .",
    "we do the same here using equation @xmath40 .",
    "thus we find that @xmath54 which exhibits that these two definitions of energy distribution agree for the janis - newman - winicour space - time .",

    "virbhadra@xcite proved that for @xmath64 the garfinkle - horowitz - strominger solution reduces to the janis - newman - winicour solution ; this fact was not noticed by garfinkle , horowitz and strominger in their paper .",
    "+ chamorro and virbhadra@xcite computed the energy distribution in garfinkle - horowitz - strominger space - time using the energy - momentum complex of einstein .",
    "they found that @xmath65 we compute the energy distribution for the garfinkle - horowitz - strominger space - time using equation @xmath40 and obtain @xmath66 thus , these two definitions give different results ( there is a difference of a factor @xmath67 in the second term ) .",
    "+ now defining @xmath68 the equations @xmath69 and @xmath70 may be expressed as @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath73 ; however , they differ for any other values of @xmath74 . for any values of @xmath75 , @xmath76 as well as @xmath77 decrease with an increase in @xmath78 and increase with increase in @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80 and they asymptotically ( @xmath81 ) reach the value @xmath3 . the situation is just opposite for any values of @xmath82 : @xmath76 as well as @xmath77 increase with an increase in @xmath78 and decrease with increase in @xmath83 .",

    "+ we plot the energy distributions @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath63 ( reissner - nordstrm space - time ) in the figure 1 and for @xmath85 in figure 2 .",
    "based on some analysis of the results known with many prescriptions for energy distribution ( including some well - known quasi - local mass definitions ) in a given space - time virbhadra@xcite remarked that the formulation by einstein is still the best one . in a recent paper lessner@xcite argued that the mller energy - momentum expression is a powerful concept of energy and momentum in general relativity , which motivated us to study this further .",
    "we obtained the energy distribution for the most general nonstatic spherically symmetric metric using mller s definition .",

    "this question must be considered important .",
    "energy- momentum complex is not constrained to the use of any particular coordinates ( unlike the case of the einstein complex ) ; however it does not furnish expected result for the reissner - nordstrm space - time .",
