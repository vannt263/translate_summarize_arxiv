    "<S> lett .  * 117 * , 156403 ( 2016 ) ] , we presented the first _ ab initio _ quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) results of the warm dense electron gas in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> however , a complete parametrization of the exchange - correlation free energy with respect to density , temperature , and spin polarization remained out of reach due to the absence of ( i ) accurate qmc results below @xmath0 and ( ii ) of qmc results for spin polarizations different from the paramagnetic case . here </S>",
    "<S> we overcome both remaining limitations . by closing the gap to the ground state and by performing extensive qmc simulations for different spin polarizations , </S>",
    "<S> we are able to obtain the first complete _ ab initio _ exchange - correlation free energy functional ; the accuracy achieved is an unprecedented @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this also allows us to quantify the accuracy and systematic errors of various previous approximate functionals .    </S>",
    "<S> the uniform electron gas ( ueg ) , i.e. , coulomb interacting electrons in a homogeneous positive background , is one of the seminal model systems in physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> studies of the ueg led to key insights such as fermi liquid theory @xcite , the quasi - particle picture of collective excitations @xcite , and bcs theory of superconductivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , accurate parametrizations of its ground state properties @xcite based on _ ab initio _ quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) simulations @xcite have sparked many applications @xcite and facilitated the success of density functional theory ( dft ) simulations of atoms , molecules , and real materials @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , over the last decade , there has emerged an increasing interest in matter under extreme excitation or compression , such as laser - excited solids @xcite and inertial confinement fusion targets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> astrophysical examples such as white dwarf atmospheres and planet interiors @xcite provide further motivation . </S>",
    "<S> this so - called warm dense matter ( wdm ) regime @xcite is characterized by values close to unity of the wigner - seitz radius ( quantum coupling parameter ) @xmath2 and degeneracy parameter @xmath3 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 denotes the @xmath5-dependent fermi energy , @xmath6 the particle number per volume , @xmath7 the mean interparticle distance , and @xmath8 the bohr radius . </S>",
    "<S> a third parameter is the degree of spin polarization , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is the number of spin - up ( spin - down ) electrons . </S>",
    "<S> an accurate theoretical description of this exotic state is most challenging since it must capture the nontrivial interplay of coupling , excitation , and quantum degeneracy effects . naturally , an accurate parametrization of the exchange - correlation ( xc ) free energy per electron , @xmath12 , of the ueg at wdm conditions is a fundamental step towards this goal as it constitutes key input for , e.g. , thermal dft @xcite , quantum hydrodynamics @xcite , and the construction of equations of state for astrophysical objects  @xcite .            </S>",
    "<S> the first parametrizations of @xmath12 were constructed based on uncontrolled approximations such as interpolations between known limits  @xcite , semi - empirical quantum - classical mappings @xcite , and dielectric ( linear response ) methods @xcite . _ </S>",
    "<S> ab initio _ qmc simulations of the ueg are severely limited by the fermion sign problem ( fsp ) @xcite , so the pioneering results of brown _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite were based on the restricted path integral mc ( rpimc ) approach , in which the nodal structure of the density matrix is assumed . </S>",
    "<S> however , the accuracy of the rpimc data has recently been challenged , as they are afflicted with systematic errors exceeding @xmath13 at @xmath14  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , these data were used as input for several parametrizations of @xmath12 @xcite , the most sophisticated being that of karasiev _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> ( ksdt )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unsurprisingly , all the aforementioned models substantially deviate from each other ( cf .  fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kachel_mann ] ) in the wdm regime  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this unsatisfactory situation has sparked remarkable recent progress in the field of fermionic qmc simulations @xcite . </S>",
