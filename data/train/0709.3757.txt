    "the most well studied constructions of brane inflation in string theory are within the context of orientifolds of calabi - yau flux compactifications of type iib superstring theory .   in these constructions",
    "it is possible to stabilize all phenomenologically dangerous moduli ( complex structure and dilaton as well as khler moduli ) .",
    "the stabilization involves both fluxes threading cycles of the calabi - yau and non - perturbative elements such as d7-branes ( or euclidean d3-brane instantons ) wrapping four - cycles  @xcite .",
    "the fluxes can produce a large warped throat region providing a relatively stable and concrete setting for the study of brane dynamics .",
    "we consider the motion of a d3-brane probe in this throat both from the point of view of an observer on the brane and from the point of view of an observer living _ elsewhere _ ( somewhere in the compactification where the standard model can be embedded ) .",
    "in addition to examining radial motion of the brane we allow the brane to move with angular momentum in the extra dimensions .",
    "and @xmath0 cycles decrease in size from the ultraviolet to the infrared where they end in a smooth @xmath1 and zero size @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the geometry is composed of @xmath3 d3 and @xmath4 d5-branes . ]    in general , calabi - yau spaces are nonsingular ; however , for certain values of parameters they can develop singularities .",
    "locally these singularities appear as a cone , or `` conifold '' .",
    "when fluxes are introduced this cone can become a warped throat region . here",
    "we take this throat to be the nonsingular warped deformed conifold ( or klebanov - strassler ( ks ) geometry )  @xcite .   and",
    "the singular warped conifold are considered in  @xcite . ]",
    "far from the tip the space is approximated by the conifold @xmath5 ( topologically an @xmath2 fibered over an @xmath1 ) . in calabi - yau manifolds",
    "three - cycles come in poincar duals .",
    "the throat decomposes into two such three - cycles , the @xmath6 and dual @xmath0 cycle .",
    "the geometry is supported by @xmath3 d3-branes and @xmath4 d5-branes wrapping the @xmath2 of @xmath7 ( so - called fractional d3-branes ) .",
    "the background fluxes are composed of both the rr and ns - ns three - forms present in type iib superstring theory and thread the @xmath6 and @xmath0 cycles respectively : _ a f_3 ~m , _",
    "b h_3 ~-k , where @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath6 cycle ends in a smooth @xmath1 ( see figure  [ kstrc.eps ] ) .",
    "the fluxes stabilize the dilaton and complex structure ( shape ) moduli but do not lift the closed string khler moduli associated with the volumes of four - cycles in the compactification  @xcite .",
    "this stabilization is accomplished by nonperturbative effects such as d7-branes wrapped around the four - cycles @xmath10 in the space  @xcite .",
    "the ks throat is smoothly glued onto the calabi - yau space in the ultraviolet ( uv ) ( see figure  [ warped.eps ] ) .",
    "consider the dynamics of a d3-brane probe in this background .",
    "the d3 brane fills four - dimensional spacetime @xmath11 and appears point - like in the internal space .",
    "the metric ansatz is : d",
    "s_10 ^ 2=h^-1/2 g _",
    "d x^ d x^ + h^1/2 g_m n d y^m d y^n , where @xmath12 is the warp factor , @xmath13 is the metric in four - dimensions and @xmath14 is the metric of the internal space .",
    "the location of the brane in the extra dimensions is parameterized by a field @xmath15 .",
    "this field is related to the proper radial throat coordinate @xmath16 ( the proper length with respect to the internal metric ( _ i.e. _  @xmath17 ) ) by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the brane tension given in terms of the string length , @xmath20 , by @xmath21 . in principle the brane is free to move in the five angular coordinates @xmath22 .",
    "it is the motion in these angular coordinates that is usually ignored and that we focus on here .",
    "the brane motion is described by the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action plus wess - zumino term : s= -t_3 g_s^-1 , where @xmath23 is the string coupling , @xmath24 is the dilaton and @xmath25 .",
    "the warp factor of the ks geometry is : h ( ) = ( g_s m )^2 2 ^ 2/3 ^-8/3_^.[hks ] here @xmath26 is a dimension - full parameter , @xmath27 = \\ell$ ] , and @xmath28 is the _ dimensionless _ geometric coordinate parameterizing the throat .",
    "the geometric variable is related to the radial coordinate via the transformation : r = _ 0^ .",
    "[ ksrdef ] a tedious calculation yields the surprisingly simple result for the ten - dimensional ricci curvature of the ks space : r = - .    as an illustrative example , we allow the brane to move in the radial @xmath28 direction and in the angular @xmath29 and @xmath30 directions : v^2 = a()+b ( ) _ 1 ^ 2 , where a()= , b ( ) = and k ( ) = . in general , the conserved angular momenta are given by : _",
    "r = , corresponding to the conserved q - numbers of the symmetry group .",
    "the conserved angular momenta in our example are @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and the conserved energy ( per unit mass ) is [ energyks ] = where @xmath33 the time evolution of the radial coordinate @xmath28 is [ etadotks ] ^2 = = q .",
    "the zeros of @xmath34 determine turning ( bounce ) points in the brane trajectory .",
    "we plot @xmath35 for typical values of the parameters in figure  [ qksc100.eps ] .     for a brane moving in the ks background as the angular momenta",
    "is increased from @xmath36 ( top , dashed line ) to higher values . in @xmath37",
    "we keep @xmath38 , and allow @xmath39 to vary , whereas in @xmath40 we keep @xmath41 and change @xmath42 .",
    "the zeros of @xmath34 correspond to turning points in the brane trajectory . ]",
    "an observer living on the d3-brane experiences expansion and contraction depending on the motion of the brane in the warped throat .",
    "the projected metric in four dimensions may be written in friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) form : ds^2 = h^-1/2(-(1-hv^2)dt^2 + dx_i dx^i ) = -d^2 + a^2()dx_i dx^i , with scale factor a()= h^-1/4 ( ( ) ) and with brane cosmic time related to the bulk time coordinate by d= h^-1/4dt .",
    "the resulting expansion on the brane is induced by the warping of the background as in  @xcite . from figure  [ qksc100.eps ] , it is clear that the brane observer can experience bounces in the scale factor @xmath43 either when the brane reaches the end of the smooth ks geometry or when a bounce occurs due to large angular momentum ( zeros of @xmath34 ) . when the brane moves down the throat the brane scale factor contracts and when the brane moves up the throat it expands .",
    "the expansion and contraction rate is determined by the warp factor in the throat , @xmath12 , and is quantified by the hubble parameter @xmath44 .",
    "the lowermost solution in figure  [ qksc100.eps ] ( b ) is a bound state where the brane bounces back and forth between two zeros of @xmath34 .",
    "this corresponds to a cyclic cosmology from the brane observer s point of view .",
    "the above models provide interesting string theory motivated , time - dependent solutions that yield bounces and cyclic motion in the scale factor .",
    "they therefore provide testing grounds for discovering general physical features more realistic cyclic and bouncing cosmologies may posses .",
    "there are serious challenges , however , for a cosmological scenario based on the mirage picture to overcome .",
    "for example , because the cosmological expansion is induced by the background warping , it is unclear how to reheat the universe or recover einstein gravity on the brane at late times  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , mirage cosmology branes bouncing through the tip of ks typically have an unacceptably large blue tilt to the scalar spectral index , @xmath45 , on super - hubble scales in the expanding phase  @xcite .",
    "alternative to the mirage picture , one may study cosmological dynamics from the perspective of an observer living elsewhere in the calabi - yau ( _ e.g . on a stack of @xmath46 d3-branes )  @xcite . in this case",
    "the motion of the d3-brane in the throat gives rise to an inflaton field @xmath15 ( related to the geometric radial coordinate @xmath28 ) in the four - dimensional effective theory of the elsewhere observer  @xcite .",
    "if the brane is spinning , the conserved angular momentum may appear as a field ( or several fields , @xmath47 ) in the effective theory obtained by integrating out the internal coordinates : [ dbigrav ] s & = & + & & -g_s^-1 , where the field theory function @xmath48 is related to the warp factor @xmath49 by @xmath50 .",
    "the four - dimensional einstein - hilbert action arises from dimensional reduction of the closed string sector of the ten - dimensional action  @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations of the brane are described by the dirac - born - infeld action .",
    "the planck mass , @xmath51 is relate to the internal six - dimensional volume , @xmath52 , by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 .",
    "the potential @xmath55 generally arises once the system is coupled to other sectors of the theory . in a realistic model",
    "the potential can be quite complicated , however , for our purposes it suffices to consider the simple @xmath56 potential .",
    "_    assuming an frw ansatz for the metric and defining @xmath57 , the equations of motion can be written @xmath58\\cdot   \\left(1+f\\left(\\frac { h^2}{\\beta }          - v\\right ) \\right)^{-1}\\label{hdot1 }          \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] subject to the friedmann constraint h^2 = ( + v ) , where we have defined the hubble parameter @xmath59 and angular momentum @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the `` lorentz '' factor generated by the non - standard kinetic term for the fields in ( [ dbigrav ] ) : [ gammal ] = .",
    "equation ( [ gammal ] ) places an upper bound on the brane velocity in the radial direction : @xmath63 .",
    "the velocity bound operates independently from the presence of angular momentum and leads to inflation in models with potentials normally too steep to do so  @xcite .",
    "it would appear , however , that it is difficult to build a successful model of dbi inflation in the ks geometry , as @xmath62 seemingly grows too large to ignore back reaction effects of the probe brane  @xcite .    from the point of view of the elsewhere observer and in contrast to the brane - bound observer the d3-brane inflaton",
    "_ always drives expansion of the four - dimensional scale factor @xmath64 .",
    "the brane probe bounces up and down through the tip of the ks throat leading to inflation sourced by the dbi action ( [ dbigrav ] ) .",
    "the bounces are strongly damped by the force due to the potential @xmath55 .",
    "if the inflaton couples to standard model fields ( _ e.g. _ through couplings of the form @xmath65 or @xmath66 ) reheating will occur  @xcite .",
    "_    the addition of angular momentum alters the form of the acceleration parameter : - . using equations ( [ phidot1 ] ) and ( [ hdot1 ] ) we have : = \\ { ^2 + ^-1 } [ epsilonpar ] .",
    "although the angular momentum term adds a positive contribution to @xmath67 , its dominant effect is to decrease the overall value of @xmath67 by decreasing the brane speed @xmath68 .",
    "hence , the addition of angular momentum tends to prolong the inflationary period by allowing the acceleration parameter to remain small for a slightly longer period of time .",
    "the angular momentum is suppressed by @xmath69 and is therefore rapidly diluted during inflation ; however , _ spinflaton _",
    "fields can help a given inflationary scenario by providing a small number of extra e - foldings of expansion at early times .",
    "it would be interesting to look for observable signatures of spinflaton fields , for example , in the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "such a search requires an understanding of cosmological perturbation theory in multi - field models with non - standard kinetic terms .",
    "we have initiated this study in @xcite .",
    "we found the distinctive feature that non - adiabatic entropy modes and adiabatic curvature perturbations propagate with different speeds .",
    "this leads to a suppression in the conversion of isocurvature to curvature perturbations and unique observable features in the form of non - gaussianities  @xcite , above and beyond the familiar non - gaussianities associated with dbi inflation  @xcite .",
