    "xte j1908 + 094 is an x - ray transient serendipitously discovered with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( @xmath3 ) proportional counter array ( pca ) when it went into outburst in 2002 february @xcite .",
    "the source flux in the 210kev band rose by a factor of @xmath23 in one month @xcite and reached about 100 mcrab on 2002 april 6 @xcite .",
    "the power density spectrum showed a broad quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) at 1hz without any coherent pulsation between 0.001 and 1024hz @xcite . in the x - ray energy spectrum ,",
    "an iron emission line and a hard tail up to 250kev were detected @xcite .",
    "the hard x - ray spectrum did not agree with an extrapolation of the absorbed power - law model in the 230kev band reported by @xcite , and showed a high - energy cut - off at @xmath2 100kev @xcite .",
    "given the timing and spectral characteristics , xte j1908 + 094 is suggested to be a black hole candidate @xcite .",
    "the broad band x - ray spectrum of xte j1908 + 094 is well fitted with two continuum components , a multi - temperature disk blackbody with @xmath4 @xmath2 0.8kev and a compton plasma with a temperature near 40kev , and an emission line centered on the location of the fe k@xmath5 line @xcite .",
    "the emission feature is very broad with fwhm@xmath6kev ( line width @xmath7kev ) , which may be due to compton scattering in a corona or the relativistic effects from gravitational redshift and doppler broadening of orbital motion @xcite . in the latter case , the broadening of the fe emission line would be expected to be asymmetric , and could be used to measure the black hole ( bh ) spin @xcite .",
    "based on this method , @xcite measured the dimensionless spin of xte j1908 + 094 to be @xmath8 .",
    "the radio counterpart of xte j1908 + 094 was discovered with the very large array ( vla ) at r.a.=@xmath9 , decl.=+@xmath10 ( j2000.0 ) @xcite , which is consistent with the @xmath11 position , r.a.=@xmath12 , decl.=+@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified a likely near - infrared ( nir ) counterpart for the source , but the possible counterpart was resolved into two sources separated by @xmath2 0.8arcsec in subsequent observations @xcite .",
    "both potential counterparts are consistent with xte j1908 + 094 being a low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb )",
    ". one of the nir sources would indicate an intermediate / late type ( a - k ) main - sequence companion star , while the other would indicate a late - type main - sequence companion star with spectral type later than k @xcite .",
    "recently , @xmath1/uvot observed the x - ray source ; however , no counterpart was found in the @xmath14 band with the 3@xmath15 limiting magnitude to be @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the distance to xte j1908 + 094 is not well established .",
    "based on its x - ray flux , the source is suggested to be at a distance greater than 3kpc @xcite . from the optical measurements , the possible distance range is 310kpc @xcite .",
    "an estimate using the x - ray and radio fluxes puts the source at a distance of @xmath2 210kpc @xcite .",
    "previously , xte j1908 + 094 went through two outbursts in 2002 and early 2003 with very similar spectral evolution @xcite . on 2013",
    "october 26 , another outburst of xte j1908 + 094 was detected by the @xmath1 burst alert telescope ( bat ) , with the 1550kev flux reaching @xmath2 60mcrab two days later @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a number of telescopes , including @xmath0 , @xmath1 @xcite , the vla @xcite , the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ) large array @xcite , the _ monitor of all - sky x - ray image _ ( _ maxi _ , * ? ? ?",

    "the long exposure obtained with @xmath0 between mjd 56605 and mjd 56606 occurred after the source reached the soft state .",

    "[ fig : mo1],scaledwidth=48.0% ]      the @xmath0 light curves of fpma and fpmb ( see the top panels of figure  [ fig : bum ] ) with background subtraction show a flare of @xmath37 ks duration with the peak rate being @xmath240% above the non - flare rate .",

    "the background light curves are stable at an average value of 1.3 @xmath29 , less than 6% of the net source count rate .",
    "thus , although the high background caused by grs 1915 + 105 affects the statistical quality of the xte j1908 + 094 spectrum , figure  [ fig : bum ] demonstrates that the flare in the light curves comes from xte j1908 + 094 . to study whether the flare has a different spectrum from the non - flare emission , we first checked the ratios of the 1079 kev count rates to the 3 - 10 kev count rates . during the flare ,",
    "this hardness ratio increased ( bottom panels of figure  [ fig : bum ] ) , indicating that there is spectral variation .",
    "to investigate further , we extracted the 379kev spectra prior to the flare , during the flare and after the flare and fitted them together using a simple model combining an energy - independent multiplicative factor ( constant ) , an absorption model ( tbabs ) , adopting abundances from @xcite , a power - law model ( pegpwrlw ) and a multi - temperature disk - blackbody model ( diskbb ) , i.e , constant @xmath38 tbabs @xmath38 ( pegpwrlw + diskbb ) .",

    "then , we used the model constant @xmath38 tbabs @xmath38 ( pegpwrlw + diskbb ) ( model 1 ) to fit the flare spectra plus combined non - flare spectra , and freed the power - law component in these two data sets .",

    "the model calculates the disk continuum around a kerr black hole and fully takes the relativistic effects into account .",
    "moreover , following previous papers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an empirical comptonization convolution model , simpl @xcite , which assumes that a fraction of seed photons are scattered into a power - law component , was used instead of the power - law model ( model 5 ) .",
    "spectra and components of model 5 in @xmath180 representation .",
    "black and red crosses are , respectively , fpma and fpmb spectra from the non - flare times ; green and blue crosses are the flare spectra .",
    "the two upper dotted lines exhibit the simpl @xmath38 kerrbb components of the flare and non - flare spectra , while the two lower dashed lines exhibit the reflection components .",
    "the reflection component of the flare spectra is stronger than that of the non - flare spectra .",
    "[ fig : mo4],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    similar to the fits above , a high folding energy was preferred by model 5 .",
    "although we also tested the fits with @xmath181 fixed at 100 kev and the iron abundance left as a free parameter , we only show the spectral fitting with @xmath182 kev and fe / solar=1.5 in table  [ tab : mo2 ] and figure  [ fig : mo3 ] because there is only a slight change in the goodness of fit for other values of those parameters .",
    "the distance of xte j1908 + 094 is thought to be @xmath183 kpc ; thus , @xmath121 was set to be 2kpc or 10kpc .",
    "the spin and the inclination of kerrbb are linked to those of relconv .",
    "other model parameters were fixed at the default values .",
    "we obtained a very small improvement in the fits with the reduced @xmath166 of 1.06 for 2092 dof . except for the normalization of the kerrbb model ,",
    "all model parameters show little changes if @xmath121 was changed from 10kpc to 2kpc .",
    "thus , we only show the spectral fitting with @xmath184 kpc ( see figure  [ fig : mo4 ] ) .",
    "the bh spin can take values in a wide range , from @xmath179 to @xmath185 .",
    "the unabsorbed flux in the 212 kev band are @xmath186  and @xmath187  for the non - flare and flare spectra , respectively . using the average flux over the non - flare and flare stages , and assuming a typical @xmath117 of @xmath188 and @xmath189 kpc , the source luminosity is @xmath190  and the eddington fraction ( @xmath191 ) is 0.1%  2.7% .",
    "while the upper part of the @xmath191 range would not be unusual for a soft state , the lower part of the range is low for a soft state ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this may favor a source distance closer to 10 kpc than 2 kpc .    previously , using the @xmath192 mecs spectra from the 2002 outburst , @xcite measured the spin of the black hole in xte j1908 + 094 .",
    "the thermal emission was not detected in these spectra ; thus , they used the reflection component to constrain the spin and reported a value of @xmath193 .",
    "if we fix the spin at 0.75 and set the other parameters to be the same as for model 5 , the quality of the spectral fit is still good .",
    "other than the bh mass being larger , the parameters are similar to those of model 5 .",
    "however , given the large uncertainties in the spin , distance and inclination , it is impossible to constrain @xmath117 with our current data .",
    "the inclination measurement is independent of the bh spin that we assume with a value of @xmath194 , similar to @xmath195 reported by @xcite .",
    "although these models containing the disk , the power - law ( comptonization ) and the reflection components fit the @xmath0 spectra well , upon closer inspection , we find a small bump in the residuals near 89kev ( see figure  [ fig : mo3 ] ) .",
    "a similar feature is also observed in some other @xmath0 spectra , such as cyg x-1 @xcite . adding a gaussian emission line with @xmath196 kev and @xmath197 kev ,",
    "the spectral fits are improved with @xmath198 , and the key parameters change only slightly .",
    "the line feature is likely related to a combination of iron k@xmath199 and nickel emission , neither of which are included in the reflionx_hc model @xcite .",
    "we have presented @xmath0 and @xmath1 observations of xte j1908 + 094 during its 2013 outburst .",
    "similar to the two previous outbursts , the source was first detected in the hard state , then went into the soft state and decayed rapidly afterwards .",
    "the time interval between the 2013 outburst and the last one is about 10 years , which is much longer than that between the two previous outbursts .",
    "the @xmath0 light curves show a flare of @xmath2 40 ks duration . fitting the spectra with the two components combining model of diskbb plus pegpwrlw prior to , during and after the flare , we found the power - law component , rather than the disk component , exhibited major changes during the flare .",
    "the power - law was softer and brighter during the flare but seems to be stable in the stages prior to and after the flare .",
    "a possible scenario is that there was an injection of high - energy particles ( perhaps due to a jet ejection or shocks in the accretion disk ) during the flare ; thus , the flux of the power - law component increased , and the power - law index varied .",
    "if we keep the power - law model constant during the whole observation and add another power - law model in fitting the flare spectrum , the extra emission is found to have a photon index of @xmath200 with a 379 kev flux of @xmath201 .",
    "jet ejections are not unusual in galactic x - ray binaries .",
    "other sources , such as grs 1915 + 105 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gro j1655 - 40 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and cygnus x-1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , also show ejection events",
    ". there are at least two types of ejections : one is the discrete outflow usually appearing in the hard - to - soft state transition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the other is the compact jet occurring in the hard state and disappearing in the hard - to - soft state transition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the radio flux of xte j1908 + 094 showed a significant increase between 2013 november 5 and november 6 @xcite , which was 23 days before the @xmath0 observations . @xcite and @xcite suggested that the source ejected some optically thin radio - emitting plasma during the period .",
    "in fact , the radio flux peaked during the @xmath0 observation .",
    "also , the radio polarization measurements and the radio spectrum are consistent with the discrete ejection interpretation @xcite .",
    "moreover , we note that radio flares are accompanied by x - ray flares in some x - ray binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "based on the facts that the source was in a transition from the hard state to the soft state and the radio flare was apparent , such x - ray ejections would not be surprising .",
    "the x - ray flare observed by @xmath0 may have been caused by a discrete ejection .",
    "although a couple of faint x - ray jets were detected from microquasars a few years after the ejection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the x - ray emission produced by the plasmoid ejection may not be enough to explain the observed flux of xte j1908 + 094 .",
    "thus , sudden changes of the temperature or the size of the corona may be another scenario .",
    "we used a comptonization model comptt @xcite to replace the power - law model in model 1 , and untied different combinations of parameters in the non - flare and flare spectra .",
    "if the plasma temperature , @xmath202 , and the 379 kev flux in units of @xmath203 , @xmath204 , are allowed to be different for the different spectra , we obtain @xmath205kev and @xmath206 from the non - flare spectra , and @xmath207kev and @xmath208 during the flare , with @xmath209 ; if , instead of the temperature , the plasma optical depth parameter , @xmath210 , is allowed to be free , we obtain @xmath211 and @xmath212 from the non - flare spectra , and @xmath213 and @xmath214 during the flare , with @xmath215 .",
    "we note that the ejection might remove material and cause a drop in the optical depth .",
    "if the corona is actually part of the jet , such as its base @xcite , the two explanations that we discuss ( an ejection or a change in the coronal properties ) might be related .    during the hard state of the 2002 outburst , a broad line feature with an average energy of @xmath216kev and a line width of @xmath217 kev was observed by @xcite .",
    "the feature disappeared in the soft state , whereas it reappeared when the source later entered into the hard state .",
    "the flux of the line component is strongly linked to that of the power - law component ; thus , @xcite suggested that the line feature might be the fe k@xmath5 line from the reprocessing of the hard x - ray photons by cooler material close to the central object . in order to search for the line feature over the whole 2013 outburst",
    ", we used the same model as @xcite to fit the @xmath1 spectra .",
    "however , for most observations , the line feature is not remarkable , and the two component model containing the diskbb and power - law components could also fit the spectra successfully ( figure  [ fig : para]b ) .",
    "this may be due to the lower throughput of @xmath1/xrt above 6 kev , making the line feature undetectable .",
    "moreover , in several observations of the soft state , the spectra show a possible fe k@xmath5 line feature , and this is further confirmed by the @xmath0 observation ( see figure  [ fig : mo1 ] and figure  [ fig : mo3 ] where there is an iron line and hard x - ray bump ) . the gaussian emission line models could fit the line feature , with model 2b ( free @xmath79 ) providing a better fit ( see figure  [ fig : mo3 ] and table  [ tab : mo1 ] ) .",
    "if a moderate @xmath79 of @xmath156 or @xmath159 is used , @xmath158 agrees with the energy range of iron emission ; if @xmath79 is allowed to be free , @xmath158 is well below this energy range , in which case the emission line may be redshifted due to the gravitational effect .",
    "regardless of the value of @xmath79 , the line widths are about 1 - 2 kev , which are similar to those reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the reflection component can also be well fitted by the reflionx_hc model , although the folding energy is not well constrained . as would be expected due to the stronger power - law flux during the flare ,",
    "the ionization parameter , @xmath165 , during the flare is larger than for the non - flare spectra .    adding a relativistic blurring model ( model 4 ) , relconv , provides only a small improvement on the quality of the fit to the spectrum , and the parameters of model 4 and model 5 ( replacing the multi - temperature disk - blackbody by the kerrbb model ) , agree with those of model 3 .",
    "the reflection covering fractions , calculated from the ratio in 2040kev flux between the reflection and the power - law component , are 1.12.2 for the non - flare spectra and 1.63.9 for the flare spectra based on the different models .",
    "we note that the covering fractions are larger than 1 , which indicates that the x - ray emission may come from closer to the black hole and the relativistic effects are stronger so that the light is gravitationally bent @xcite .",
    "based on the relconv parameters , all possible values for the spin of the black hole ( @xmath179 to 0.998 ) are allowed when the inner radius is fixed to the isco , which means that the spectra may be extremely blurred , with a maximal bh spin , or somewhat less blurred with a retrograde disk or with the inner disk being ionized . following @xcite ,",
    "the reflection fraction can give a lower limit on the black hole spin when assuming a lamppost geometry ( i.e. , a point - like corona above the spin axis of the bh ) ; in that case a covering fraction above 1.6 implies a spin greater than 0.6 .",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 observed xte j1908 + 094 during its 2013 outburst .",
    "the @xmath1 monitoring observations show that the source reached the soft state very close to the time that @xmath0 observed the source .",
    "a flare with a duration of @xmath218ks appears in the @xmath0 light curve , peaking at @xmath240% above the non - flare level .",
    "when fitting the non - flare and flare spectra with two - component models , consisting of diskbb plus pegpwrlw or diskbb plus comptt , we found that the power - law component ( or the comptonization component ) , rather than the disk component , went through great changes during the flare . changes of the corona , including variations of its temperature or its size , or the ejection of hot plasma , are two possible and potentially related scenarios for the flare .",
    "a broad iron line feature with @xmath219kev is observed in the @xmath0 spectrum , which motivates a spectral model that combines a thermal disk , a power - law and a reflection component , providing a good fit to the spectrum .",
    "although the broad iron line provides evidence for relativistic blurring of the reflection component , we are not able to constrain the bh spin in the spectral fits , and all possible spin values , from @xmath179 to @xmath220 , are allowed .",
    "the strong reflection component requires a covering fraction in excess of 1.0 , which may be explained if light bending by the bhs gravitational field enhances the flux incident on the inner disk and suggests a spin larger than 0.6 .",
