    "distinctive properties of slow @xcite , stored @xcite and stationary @xcite light have been extensively studied for more than a decade . the research has been motivated both by the fundamental interest in the slow and stationary light and also because of the potential applications including inter alia the reversible quantum memories @xcite and non - linear optics at low intensities @xcite .",
    "the slow light is formed due to the phenomenon known as the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite .",
    "the eit emerges in a medium resonantly driven by several laser fields and involves the destructive quantum interference between different resonant excitation pathways of atoms . as a result",
    "a weaker ( probe ) beam of light tuned to an atomic resonance can propagate slowly and almost lossles when the medium is driven by one or several control beams light with a higher intensity . under suitable conditions reshaping of the dispersive properties of",
    "the medium by the control beams leads to a drastic reduction in the group velocity of the probe pulse .",
    "group velocities as small as several of tens of meters per second have been reported @xcite .",
    "most of the work on the slow light dealt with a single probe beam and one or several control beams resonantly interacting with atomic media , with @xmath0 configuration of the atom - light coupling being one the mostly exploited @xcite .",
    "recently it was suggested to create a two component slow light using a more complex double tripod setup @xcite involving three ground atomic states coupled with two excited states .",
    "such a setup supports a simultaneous propagation of two probe beams and leads to the formation of a two - component slow light . by properly choosing the control lasers one can generate a tunable coupling between the constituent probe fields .    the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) @xcite provides an additional possibility in manipulating the slow light .",
    "the optical oam represents an extra degree of freedom which can be exploited in the quantum computation and quantum information storage @xcite .",
    "most of the previous studies on the vortex slow light considered situations where the incident probe beam carries an oam @xcite , yet the control beam has no vortex .",
    "application of a vortex control beam causes a potential problem , because its intensity goes to zero at the vortex core leading to the disappearance of the eit accompanied with the absorption losses in this spatial region . to avoid such losses",
    "it was suggested @xcite to employ an extra control laser beam without an optical vortex making a more complex tripod scheme of the atom - light coupling previously considered for the non - vortex beams of light @xcite .",
    "the total intensity of the control lasers is then non - zero at the vortex core of the first control laser thus avoiding the losses .",
    "using such a scheme a transfer of an optical vortex can be accomplished during the switching off and on the control beams @xcite .    here",
    "we show that the transfer of the vortex between the control and probe beams can be accomplished without switching off and on the control beams using a more complex double tripod scheme of the atom - light coupling .",
    "the scheme shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig : double - tripod ] involves three atomic ground states coupled to two excited states via four control beams two of them carrying optical vortices .",
    "if the incoming probe beam does not carry an optical vortices , the coupling with the control beams generates another component of the probe beam containing an oam .",
    "we explore the efficiency of such a transfer of the optical vortex .",
    "we analyze the losses resulting from the exchange of the optical vortex between the control and probe beams , and provide conditions for the optical vortex of the control beam to be transferred efficiently to the second component of the probe beam .",

    "the atoms are characterized by three hyperfine ground levels @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 which have dipole - allowed optical transitions to the electronic excited state levels @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the atom - light coupling scheme involves two laser fields of low intensity ( probe fields ) and four fields of much higher intensity ( control fields ) .",
    "the probe beams are described by the electric field amplitudes @xmath9 and @xmath10 with the corresponding central frequencies @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "they drive atomic transitions @xmath13 and @xmath14 , characterized by the dipole moments @xmath15 and @xmath16 . control fields having frequencies @xmath17 couple the atomic transitions @xmath18 and @xmath19 with coupling strength being characterized by rabi frequencies @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "we assume the four photon resonances with the probe beams for each pair of the control lasers , meaning that @xmath22 .",

    "the double tripod scheme can be implemented using atoms like rubidium or sodium which contain two hyperfine ground levels with @xmath24 and @xmath1 , as illustrated in fig .",

    "such atoms have been used in the initial light - storage experiments involving a simpler @xmath0 setup @xcite . in the present context the states @xmath4 and @xmath25",
    "correspond to the magnetic states with @xmath26 and @xmath27 of the @xmath24 hyperfine ground level , whereas the state @xmath28 represents the hyperfine ground state with @xmath1 and @xmath27 .",
    "the two states @xmath29 and @xmath30 correspond to the electronic excited states with @xmath31 of the @xmath24 and @xmath1 manifolds . to make the double tripod setup both probe beams are to be circular @xmath2 polarized and all four control beams are to be circular @xmath3 polarized .",
    "note that such a scheme can be implemented by adding three extra control laser beams to the @xmath0 setup used previously in the experiment by liu _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "in the previous studies of the multicomponent light @xcite the counterpropagating probe and control beams have been considered . here",
    "we analyze an opposite situation where the probe and control fields co - propagate ( along the @xmath32 axis ) .",
    "probe fields can then be written as @xmath33 , @xmath34 , with @xmath35 being the central wave - vector of the @xmath36-th probe beam .",
    "the copropagating setup is more suited for the efficient transfer of an optical vortex between the control and probe beams we are interested in . for paraxial beams the amplitudes @xmath37 and @xmath38 depend weakly on the propagation direction @xmath32 , the fast spatial dependence being accommodated in the exponential factors @xmath39 .",
    "the same applies to the control beams which copropagate along the @xmath32 axis and has the form @xmath40 , with @xmath41 being the central wave - vector .",
    "we shall neglect the atomic center of mass motion .",
    "the electronic properties of the atomic ensemble is described by the atomic flip operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 describing the coherences between the atomic internal states @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath4 at a certain spatial point . for the convenience",
    "we introduce the column of the probe field amplitudes @xmath46 and columns of atomic flip operator @xmath47 and @xmath48 . defining the parameter @xmath49 characterizing the atom - light coupling strength ( assumed to be equal for both probe fields ) , the equation for the slowly in time and in space varying amplitudes of the probe fields",
    "can be written as follows : @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the atomic density and @xmath52 is a diagonal @xmath53 matrix of the probe field wavevectors .",
    "the diffraction term containing the transverse derivatives @xmath54 can be neglected when the change in the phase of the probe fields due to this term is much smaller than @xmath55 .",
    "the transverse derivative can be estimated as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a characteristic transverse dimension of the probe beams .",
    "if the probe beam carries an optical vortex , @xmath57 can be associated with a width of the vortex core . on the other hand , for the probe beam without an optical vortex",
    ", @xmath57 is a characteristic width of the beam .",
    "the change in time of the probe field can be estimated as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the length of the atomic cloud and @xmath60 is the change of the field .",

    "it can be neglected when the sample length @xmath59 is not too large , @xmath62 .",
    "taking the length of the atomic cloud @xmath63 , the characteristic transverse dimension of the probe beam @xmath64 and the wave - length @xmath65 , we obtain @xmath66 .",
    "therefore we can drop out the diffraction term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s - electric-0 ] ) obtaining @xmath67 equations describing the atom - light coupling are @xmath68 where the dagger refers to a hermitian conjugated matrix .",

    "if the rabi frequencies of the control beams driving transitions from the level @xmath6 are proportional to the rabi frequencies of the beams driving transitions from the level @xmath5 ( @xmath77 ) , the double tripod system becomes equivalent to a double @xmath0 system for zero two photon detuning . on the other hand if @xmath78 , the double tripod system is equivalent to two not connected tripod systems for zero two photon detuning .",
    "we shall concentrate on the case where the double tripod system is not equivalent to a double @xmath0 system and the inverse matrix @xmath79 does exist .",
