    "quantum turbulence is a common phenomenon in superfluids , ranging from the dense @xmath0he and @xmath10he liquids to the very dilute bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) .",
    "it consists of vortices having a quantized circulation that can be created , e.g. , by stirring the superfluids with a moving object or by rotation . in the helium",
    "superfluids the easiest way to produce vorticity is by using oscillating objects like spheres , tuning forks or vibrating wires .",
    "because of the simple geometry of a sphere its behavior is more transparent and more easily analyzed than that of the more complicated oscillating structures .    in the case of a bec",
    "the moving object is typically a laser beam that presents an obstacle to the condensate .",
    "the laser beam is swept continuously through the condensate .",
    "in addition to the experiments there is a large body of theoretical work on the transition to turbulence based on numerical solutions ( mostly 2-dimensional ) of the nonlinear schrdinger equation , often known as gross - pitaevskii equation , which is applicable for becs but not for the dense helium liquid .",
    "the motivation for the present article is a comparison of the frequencies at which the vortices are shed in both types of superfluids .",
    "we find that in spite of the very different experimental parameters ( density , coherence length , speed of sound , interaction strength , linear dimensions , etc . )",
    "the shedding frequencies are similar .",
    "moreover , the change from oscillatory flow to steady flow will be discussed for both superfluids .",
    "the behavior of a microsphere ( radius @xmath11 = 0.12 mm ) oscillating in superfluid @xmath0he at mk temperatures has been investigated at regensburg university since 1994 @xcite and a detailed analysis of the results has been published in a series of reports since then @xcite . of particular interest is the transition from pure potential flow to turbulence at a critical velocity @xmath4 = 2.8 @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 10@xmath14 m@xmath15/s is the circulation quantum and @xmath16 is the oscillation frequency ) @xcite . in a small velocity interval @xmath2 , where @xmath17 3 @xmath18 , an instability of the flow pattern is observed , switching intermittently between phases of potential flow and turbulent phases",
    "@xcite , see fig.1 .",
    "+     corresponds to turbulent drag while the increase of the velocity amplitude occurs during potential flow , occasionally reaching the maximum value @xmath19 given by ballistic phonon drag .",
    "note the rapid increase of the lifetimes of the turbulent phases with the driving force.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    by analyzing the lifetimes of the turbulent phases we find that they are exponentially distributed as exp(-@xmath20 ) and the mean lifetimes @xmath21 grow very rapidly with increasing driving force @xmath22 : @xmath23,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 = 0.5 s for @xmath25 = @xmath26= 119 hz and 0.25 s for 160 hz . from a fit of ( 1 ) to the data we obtain the force @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the density of liquid @xmath0he .",
    "this expression is identified as the drag force resulting from the shedding of one vortex ring of size @xmath11 per half - period ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we conclude that the number @xmath29 can be interpreted as the average number of vortex rings that are shed during one - half period .",
    "we write @xmath30 in our experiments @xmath31 lies in the interval 0.7 @xmath32 3 , see fig.2 .     as function of the average number @xmath31 of vortex rings",
    "shed during one - half period .",
    "blue squares : oscillation frequency 119 hz , temperature 301 mk .",
    "black dots : 160 hz , 30 mk , with 0.05@xmath33he .",
    "note that the data are independent of oscillation frequency , of temperature , and of @xmath10he impurities .",
    "the dotted line is calculated from eq.2.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    replacing the driving force @xmath22 by the measured drag force @xcite @xmath34 we find @xmath35 , with a ",
    "characteristic \" velocity @xmath36 = 0.48 @xmath37 = 0.40 mm / s , which is of the same order as the velocity of a vortex ring of radius @xmath11 @xcite . + from @xmath31 we obtain the average shedding frequency @xmath38 where the coefficient @xmath6 = 2@xmath39 . at @xmath40",
    "= 119 hz we obtain @xmath6 = 0.60 @xmath41m@xmath42 and at 160 hz @xmath6 = 0.80 @xmath41m@xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 is a relevant length scale that is given here by @xmath44 , and which can be interpreted as the distance a vortex ring travels during one - half period .",
    "the linear scaling of @xmath6 with the oscillation frequency is likely to break down at very large frequencies , i.e. , when the period becomes shorter than the time it takes a vortex ring to be shed .",
    "then our picture of shedding of individual rings will no longer be applicable .",
    "reconnections and annihilations near the surface of the sphere will become important . in the opposite limit , when the frequency goes to zero ( steady motion ) , it is clear that the shedding frequency must remain finite because vortices can clearly be created also in the case of steady motion .",
    "therefore , there must be a crossover from the linear frequency dependence to a constant value . in that case",
    ", the relevant length scale @xmath44 is assumed to become equal to the radius @xmath11 of the sphere .",
    "this will happen at a frequency @xmath45 = 1.7 hz which is almost 2 orders of magnitude smaller than our oscillation frequencies .",
    "from @xmath46 we find @xmath47m@xmath42 , a small but finite value instead of zero . for a sketch of the frequency dependence of the coefficient @xmath6 , see fig.3 .     of @xmath48 as a function of the oscillation frequency @xmath16 . at small frequencies",
    "the radius @xmath11 of the sphere is the characteristic length scale , hence @xmath49 , whereas at large frequencies @xmath6 scales as @xmath50 , see ( 3 ) .",
    "the characteristic frequency that marks the transition between both regimes is given by @xmath51 .",
    "( numerical factors of order 1 are neglected.),scaledwidth=70.0% ]    these considerations are similar to those we used to estimate the change of the critical velocity for oscillatory flow @xmath52 when the oscillation frequency approaches zero for steady motion . in that case",
    "the characteristic length scale changes from the oscillation amplitude to the size of the sphere @xcite , reproducing the feynman critical velocity @xmath53 .",
    "the transition occurs at a characteristic oscillation frequency @xmath8 when @xmath54 , i.e. , at @xmath55 .",
    "it is interesting to note , that @xmath8 is the same ( except , may be , for some numerical factor ) as the frequency where the shedding @xmath1 has its transition , see above .",
    "thus , our experiments with the sphere in @xmath0he are clearly in the regime of oscillatory flow for both the critical velocity @xmath4 and the shedding frequency @xmath1 .",
    "quantum turbulence has been observed recently at seoul national university by moving a repulsive gaussian laser beam steadily through a bec of @xmath56na atoms @xcite . the authors observed shedding of vortex dipoles in a stable and periodic manner .",
    "the shedding frequency @xmath1 is found to increase linearly with @xmath57 : @xmath58 , where @xmath4 = 0.99 mm / s and @xmath6 = 0.25 @xmath41m@xmath42 . because the beam was moved steadily",
    "the relevant length scale is the size of the beam 2@xmath11 = 9.1 @xmath41 m , in accordance with the arguments presented above",
    ". therefore we estimate @xmath49 = 0.22 @xmath41m@xmath42 , in fair agreement with the experimental result , and @xmath59 = 3.7 mm / s ( where @xmath60 = 1.7 @xmath61 m@xmath15/s for the @xmath56na bec ) .",
    "if the beam would have been oscillating at a frequency substantially larger than @xmath62 = 803 s@xmath42 ( or 128 hz ) we would expect a shedding frequency @xmath1 proportional to @xmath16 and a critical velocity scaling as @xmath63 , in accordance with our results in @xmath0he .",
    "earlier experiments with a moving beam were performed by ketterle s group @xcite . in that work",
    "the beam was moved back and forth at frequencies below 200 hz and the diameter of the beam was 10 @xmath41 m .",
    "although the motion was not a sinusoidal one , we can estimate @xmath64 680 s@xmath42 ( or 108 hz ) , which is of the same order of magnitude as the applied frequencies and , therefore , the frequencies are too close to the steady regime to show the frequency dependencies of both @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "more details of the work in @xcite can be found in @xcite where care was taken to distinguish between the critical velocity for heating the bec due to phonon emission by the moving beam and that of vortex production . in our experiments in helium",
    "the situation is simpler because of the very different ratio of the critical velocity to the speed of sound that is of the order of @xmath65 in @xmath0he while in the becs it is typically 0.1 to 0.5 .",
    "therefore , in our case the critical velocity is not affected by phonon emission .",
    "numerical work @xcite confirmed the linear increase of the energy dissipation above @xmath4 which is equivalent to a linear increase of @xmath1 .",
    "that result agrees also with earlier numerical work on the drag force at steady motion @xcite from which also a linear behavior of @xmath1 can be inferred .",
    "more recently , an oscillating object in a bec has been investigated theoretically @xcite , but shedding frequencies have not been calculated so far . the frequency range in that work",
    "was limited to 0.2@xmath661.0 and , therefore , is also in the regime of steady flow , which is also evident from the frequency independence of the critical velocity for multiple vortex pair production @xmath67 .    a very recent work by v.p .",
    "singh et al .",
    "@xcite presents exciting details of the effect of laser stirring of a bec .",
    "if the stirrer is repulsive the critical velocity is governed by vortex production while for an attractive one phonon emission is the relevant mechanism for heating . both circular and linear motion of the beam were used .",
    "vortex shedding frequencies were not an issue in that work but an estimate of the characteristic frequency @xmath8 gives a value close to the rotation frequency .",
    "therefore , the flow regime was again near the steady limit .",
    "the similarity of the vortex shedding frequency in both superfluid @xmath0he and in a bec is prominent although the systems are quite different , at least at first sight , one reason is that the circulation quanta and the size of the obstacles both differ by an order of magnitude but the ratio @xmath68 is similar .",
    "the major difference is that the oscillation frequency of the sphere is much larger than the characteristic frequency @xmath8 whereas the laser beam was moved through the bec in the steady regime .",
    "another difference is that we find an average shedding frequency of up to 3 vortex rings per half - period in our experiment while in @xcite a strictly periodic emission is observed .",
    "based on our results with the sphere in @xmath0he predictions have been made here for experiments with oscillating laser beams in a bec at much larger frequencies than the characteristic one .",
    "it would be interesting to test these considerations experimentally ."
