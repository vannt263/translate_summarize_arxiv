    "the minkowski sum of simplices yields an important class of polytopes that includes and generalizes many known polytopes . for related references and some of the history of the significance of minkowski sums of simplices we refer to the introduction in  @xcite . in  @xcite a closed formula for the @xmath6-flag polynomial ( see definition  [ def : flag - poly ] ) for an arbitrary minkowski sum of @xmath2 simplices is derived .",
    "in particular , this yields a closed formula for the @xmath7-vectors of generalized associahedra from  @xcite . this mentioned formula , however , is in terms of the _ master polytope _ @xmath8 , a @xmath9-dimensional polytope , the structure of which little is known about except when @xmath10  @xcite ,  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the family of minkowski sum of the simplices of a fixed dimension .",
    "these polytopes are interesting for a variety of reasons .",
    "we mention a few here without attempting to be exhaustive : ( i ) the polytopes in this family are all simple , and so they have a nice enumeration of their flags of arbitrary length as we will see shortly ( see lemma  [ lmm : simple ] ) .",
    "( ii ) this family forms a chain , or an incremental bridge , between the simplex of a given dimension and the standard permutahedron of the same dimension , where each step , or link , is between two such simple polytopes that differ minimally , as we will see in section  [ sec : our - fam ] .",
    "( iii ) each polytope in this family is symmetric with respect to permutation of their coordinates , like the simplex and the standard permutahedron .",
    "in fact , they make up a subclass of the class of generalized permutohedra studied in  @xcite and  @xcite , something we will discuss in more detail in section  [ sec : gen - perm ] .",
    "( iv ) by contracting each face formed by vertices of identical positive support of any polytope of this family , one obtains a hypersimplex ; a particular matroid base polytope ( or matroid basis polytope ) of the uniform matroid formed by all subsets of a fixed cardinality ( the rank of the matroid ) from a given ground set . in fact , each matroid base polytope of a matroid of a given rank is contained in a `` mother''-hypersimplex , that is , its vertices are among the vertices of the `` mother''-hypersimplex .",
    "the flags of matroid base polytopes have been studied in the literature , in particular in  @xcite and  @xcite , in which a characterization of the faces of the matroid base polytopes is presented .",
    "also , a formula for the @xmath11-index of rank - two matroid base polytope is presented , describing the number of their flags in the most compact way possible , from a linear relations perspective .",
    "( v ) last but not least , this family forms a minkowski basis for certain generalized permutahedra of the form @xmath12 as defined and discussed in  @xcite in terms of non - negative integer combination as minkowski sums . indeed , matroid base polytopes form a subclass of the family of generalized permutahedra as shown in  @xcite where some of the work from  @xcite is generalized , especially the volume of a general matroid base polytope .",
    "this will discussed in section  [ sec : gen - perm ] .",
    "the motivation for this paper stems from an observation on the enumeration of the flags of the standard permutahedron , presented in proposition  [ prp : exp - gen - func ] here below , which we now will parse through and discuss .",
    "recall that the _ permutahedron @xmath5 _ is defined to be the convex hull of @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the symmetric group of degree @xmath3 .",
    "the faces of @xmath5 have a nice combinatorial description as presented in ziegler  @xcite : each @xmath15-dimensional face of @xmath5 can be presented as an ordered partition of the set @xmath16 = \\{1,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] into exactly @xmath17 distinct parts . in particular , @xmath5 has @xmath18 faces of dimension @xmath15 for each @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the stirling number of the 2nd kind .    conventions : ( i ) for an @xmath6-tuple @xmath21 of variables and an @xmath6-tuple of numbers @xmath22 , let @xmath23 .",

    "( ii ) for a given vector @xmath38 and a polytope @xmath25 , we denote by @xmath39 or just @xmath40 the unique face of @xmath25 determined by @xmath38 as the points that maximize @xmath37 when restricted to @xmath25 .",
    "further , we denote the set of all the faces of @xmath25 by @xmath41 .",
    "more specifically we denote the set of the @xmath15-dimensional faces of @xmath25 by @xmath42 , in particular , @xmath43 denotes the set of vertices of @xmath25 .",
    "( iii ) finally , for a vector @xmath38 the set @xmath44 is the _ support _ of @xmath38 .",
    "consider now the well - known description of the @xmath15-dimensional faces of @xmath5 as the ordered partitions of @xmath16 $ ] into @xmath17 parts : more explicitly , each functional @xmath37 where the support @xmath45 has exactly @xmath17 distinct values @xmath46 , when restricted to @xmath5 , takes its maximum value at exactly one @xmath15-dimensional face @xmath47 . here",
    "each value @xmath48 of the support corresponds uniquely to one of the ordered parts defining the face @xmath47 . also , by `` merging '' two such consecutive values @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( for example , by replacing both @xmath49 and @xmath50 by their average ) , we obtain a new functional @xmath51 which is maximized at a face @xmath52 of dimension @xmath53 that contains the face @xmath47 .",
