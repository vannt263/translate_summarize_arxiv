    "a deeper understanding of the magnetic ground state as well as of finite - temperature properties of a system with local magnetic moments can be obtained in terms of corresponding exchange interactions .",
    "this is particularly true for new , artificially prepared systems , like , e.g. , monolayers of magnetic atoms on nonmagnetic substrates .",
    "a strong hybridization of the electronic states of the magnetic atoms and of the substrate may significantly influence the magnetic ground state of these systems .",
    "we mention as a typical example the fe - monolayer on bcc - w(001 ) substrate . while bcc - fe in bulk state is a ferromagnet ( fm ) , the fe - monolayer on the bcc - w(001 )",
    "surprisingly has a @xmath3 antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ground state , as was recently found by spin - polarized stm measurements @xcite .    in a subsequent theoretical study , ferriani _",
    "et al._@xcite demonstrated a strong dependence of the magnetic state of an fe - monolayer on the substrate by studying its stability on the ( 001)-face of bcc - ta@xmath0w@xmath1 random substrates .",
    "it was found that the ground state of the fe - monolayer on ta(001 ) is the fm rather than the afm one and there thus exists an interesting crossover between these two magnetic configurations at an intermediate substrate composition .",
    "results of this study also confirm the robustness of such behavior - even the unrelaxed system exhibits the same behavior although large inward relaxation of about 18  % exists between the fe monolayer and the first substrate w - layer , which can modify the result quantitatively .",
    "the authors of ref .   also clearly demonstrated the usefulness of exchange interactions for a deeper understanding of the phenomenon .",
    "based on these facts we wish to present here a more general approach to the study of the magnetic stability of such systems .",
    "let us first remind the reader of the approach adopted in paper @xcite as well as in a number of other studies.@xcite exchange interactions are estimated by evaluating the total energies of the fm and a few afm configurations by conventional bandstructure methods . in particular , in the case of fe overlayer on the w(001 ) or ta(001 ) , the authors of ref .   chose @xmath3- and @xmath4-afm configurations and mapped the total energy differences of these configurations and of the reference fm state onto the classical two - dimensional heisenberg hamiltonian ( hh ) .",
    "in this way they obtained two nearest - neighbor exchange couplings . this approach has certain limitations : ( i ) the choice of afm configurations is dictated by requirements of simplicity , although any other configuration can be used as well .",
    "one has to be aware that if some atypical configuration is chosen , the results can be biased ; ( ii ) the number of determined exchange interactions depends on the number of chosen configurations , which is limited .",
    "this is in a striking contrast with the existence of long - range interactions in such systems .",
    "for example , the presence of the surface state , e.g. , on the fcc(111 ) surfaces of noble metals leads to the decay of corresponding exchange interactions with the distance @xmath5 as @xmath6 ( see ref .  ) as compared to the @xmath7-decay known from bulk systems ( the rkky - interactions ) .",
    "in addition , the bandstructure methods do not yield directly individual exchange interactions , but rather their certain infinite sums ; ( iii ) the use of conventional bandstructure methods is strongly complicated in the presence of disorder , either in the magnetic overlayer or in the substrate . on the other hand ,",
    "if the substrate disorder is weak , a simple approach ( the virtual - crystal approximation ) can be successfully used as it was done in ref .   for the case of fe - overlayer on the taw - alloy substrate .",
    "an alternative approach is to estimate magnetic interactions among magnetic atoms directly by evaluating the energy cost related to small rotations of spins at arbitarily chosen two sites with the help of the adiabatic theorem and the green function method .",
    "this approach , first introduced by lichtenstein _",
    "@xcite for bulk ferromagnets and by oguchi _",
    "@xcite for bulk paramagnets within the disordered local moment ( dlm ) state , was then successfully generalized to a number of magnetic systems including magnetic overlayers on crystal substrates @xcite ( for further magnetic systems see the review paper @xcite ) . in this method",
    "the limitations mentioned above are removed . as the method is formulated in the real space ,",
    "the systems without perfect translational symmetry ( e.g. random alloys , overlayers , and surfaces ) can be treated on an equal footing with the crystals .",
    "one remark concerns the choice of the reference state from which the exchange interactions are extracted .",
    "conventionally , this is the fm state @xcite , but it is possible to employ also the afm reference state or any other reference state such as the dlm state . in the dlm state",
    "the spin - spin correlations are missing while in the fm- or afm - states the spins are strongly correlated .",
    "the dlm state is thus particularly suitable for discussion of the electronic origin of the magnetic phase stability as no specific magnetic order is assumed in this reference state .",
    "a traditional approach to the exchange interactions in the dlm - reference state @xcite rests on the generalized perturbation method ( gpm ) ; @xcite however , the final formula can also be obtained from the method of infinitesimal rotations of local moments applied to a random binary alloy .",
    "this equivalence is briefly sketched in section ii and in the appendix .",
    "once the exchange interactions are found , and it should be noted that they can be found even for very distant pairs of spins , one can study the ground state of the classical hh . in this way one can search over much broader class of possible magnetic systems , including incommensurate configurations , than it is possible by using a conventional supercell approach .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the supercell approach can be highly accurate and useful and we wish to point out the usefulness and complementarity of both above mentioned approaches for various aspects of the magnetic stability rather than to argue that one approach is better as compared to the other .",
    "the electronic properties of the fe - overlayer on random ta@xmath0w@xmath1(001 ) substrate will be studied in the framework of the tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbital ( tb - lmto ) method combined with the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) to treat alloy disorder in the substrate as well as the magnetic disorder in the dlm state .",
    "the effect of the surface is included in the framework of the surface green function ( sgf ) approach @xcite which employs a realistic semi - infinite sample geometry ( no slabs or periodic supercells ) .",
    "the one - electron potential is treated within the atomic sphere approximation , but the dipole barrier due to the redistribution of electrons in the vicinity of the surface is included in the formalism . the tb - lmto - sgf method can include the effect of layer relaxations approximately provided that they are known either from high - accuracy ab - initio calculations or from experiment .",
    "an important advantage of the tb - lmto - sgf approach is the possibility to estimate exchange interactions between magnetic atoms in the overlayer .",
    "we will describe such magnetic interactions in terms of the two - dimensional classical heisenberg hamiltonian , @xmath8 in which @xmath9 denotes the exchange integral between fe - spins at sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 on the surface , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are unit vectors in the directions of the local magnetization on sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "exchange interactions @xmath9 can be evaluated in the the fm reference state and in the framework of the tb - lmto - sgf method as @xmath14 where @xmath15 characterizes the exchange splitting of the fe - atom at the site @xmath10 , @xmath16 is the configurationally averaged green function describing the motion of an electron between fe - sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the magnetic overlayer on a random nonmagnetic substrate which corresponds to the spin @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and the integration is done over the contour @xmath19 in the complex energy plane @xmath20 which starts below the valence band and ends at the fermi energy .",

    "the quantity @xmath15 is defined in the tb - lmto method in terms of the potential functions @xmath23 of fe atoms as @xmath24 .",
    "the above expression represents a straightforward generalization of the corresponding bulk expression @xcite since it is formulated in the real space .",
    "we refer the reader to refs .   for details of evaluation of the real - space configurationally averaged green function @xmath16 for the magnetic overlayer on a random substrate .    in the dlm - reference state , the exchange interactions",
    "@xmath9 bear a standard form of effective pair interactions of the gpm .",
    "they are given explicitly by @xmath25 where the @xmath26 is the spin - independent configurationally averaged green function in the dlm state between fe - sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the electronic structure of the dlm state is treated in an alloy analogy , i.e. , the fe - sites are randomly occupied by two fe - species with equal probability , representing local fe - moments pointing in two opposite directions .",
    "the quantity @xmath27 is defined as @xmath28 , where the symbols @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) refer to single - site t - matrices of the tb - lmto method describing scattering due to both magnetic species on the @xmath10-th site with respect to a spin - independent effective dlm medium , see eq .",
    "( [ eqa_tmat ] ) . in the appendix , the form of eq .",
    "( [ jij - dlm ] ) is derived from the previous formula , eq .",
    "( [ jij - fm ] ) , applied to the dlm state within the alloy analogy .",
    "the exchange integrals @xmath9 characterize magnetic interactions between two particular atomic sites .",
    "it is also convenient to define the exchange parameter @xmath31 that reflects the molecular field experienced by a single moment in the ferromagnetic layer @xmath32    a negative value of this parameter indicates an instability of the fm state .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the magnetic stability employs the lattice fourier transform of the pair exchange interactions @xmath9 , see section iii c ; the parameter @xmath31 represents a special case of the fourier transformed interaction , namely , its value for zero reciprocal vector , see eq .",
    "( [ jq - def ] ) .",
    "the calculations were done assuming the vegard s law for the bulk lattice constant @xmath33 of bcc - ta@xmath0w@xmath1 random alloy ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "the electronic structure is calculated selfconsistently for a model of the system which consists of 7 atomic layers representing the alloy substrate , one fe layer , and 4 layers of empty spheres representing vacuum that are embedded between the semi - infinite substrate and the semi - infinite vacuum .",
    "similarly as in ref .  , we assume a constant inward layer relaxation of 18  % between the fe - overlayer and the bcc(001)-ta@xmath0w@xmath1 substrate . we have employed the @xmath36-basis and the vosko - wilk - nusair exchange - correlation lsda potential in all calculations .",
    "we used 20 points on the contour in the complex energy plane and 210 k - points in the irreducible wedge of the surface brillouin zone in selfconsistent calculations and up to 19600 k - points in the surface brillouin zone to calculate exchange integrals for 172 inequivalent neighbors .",
    "we compare in fig .",
    "[ dos ] the fe - projected densities of states ( pdos ) for an unsupported monoatomic fe(001 ) layer ( assuming the in - plane lattice constant of bcc - w , but the results for that of bcc - ta are very similar ) with the pdos for fe@xmath37w(001 ) and fe@xmath37ta(001 )",
    ". results for the fm and for the dlm states are shown .",
    "we observe a much stronger effect of hybridization among the fe - located and the substrate states in the case of the w substrate than for the ta substrate .",
    "the pdos for fe on the ta substrate , especially that for the majority spin , is only weakly broadened as compared to the unsupported fe layer in striking constrast to the case of the w substrate .",
    "we thus argue that the strong fe - w hybridization is the reason for the afm ordering on the w - substrate : the ground state of the weakly hybridized fe@xmath37ta(001 ) is similar to that of the unsupported fe layer , namely the fm state .",
    "roughly speaking , the stronger fe - substrate hybridization also reduces the dos at the fermi energy in the non - magnetic state and thus reduces the tendency to ferromagnetism ( the stoner criterion ) .",
    "it should be noted that the generally broader minority pdos as compared to the majority one is due to the large exchange splitting of fe electron levels : majority levels are closer to the nucleus and thus are more strongly bound giving a narrower band and just the opposite holds for the more loosely bound minority bands .",
    "another indication of a stronger hybridization of the fe - w states as compared to the fe - ta states is documented by fig .",
    "[ magmom ] , where the concentration dependence of local magnetic fe - moments evaluated in the fm and dlm states is shown .",
    "generally , a stronger hybridization of fe - w states results in an increasing difference between fm and dlm magnetic moments . the local magnetic fe moments for the unsupported fe layer are large and almost the same ( about 3.35  @xmath38 ) in both the fm and dlm configurations .",
    "a stronger hybridization reduces more the local magnetic moments for the fe@xmath37w(001 ) overlayer as compared to the fe@xmath37ta(001 ) one .    in fig .",
    "[ deepdos ] we present layer - resolved pdos for first few top layers of the fe@xmath37w(001 ) and fe@xmath37ta(001 ) systems ( averaged over spins ) and corresponding bulk substrates .",
    "we first note a large similarity between the bulk ta and w total dos which justifies the virtual crystal approximation used in ref .   to study the effect of alloy disorder in the substrate .",
    "the main difference is the position of the fermi energy which is shifted downwards in the bcc - ta because of a smaller number of valence electrons . as a consequence",
    ", the fermi energy lies inside the bonding peak of the bcc - dos while it is shifted to the energy region between the bonding and antibonding states in the bcc - w .",
    "we also mention that only the interface substrate layer and to some extent also the second substrate layer differ noticeably from the bulk substrate while the doss of other substrate layers are already quite similar to those of bulk .",
    "this is , of course , a typical feature of metallic systems in which the corresponding friedel - like oscillations ( which originate from the presence of an abrupt change of the charge density at the surface ) are quickly damped inside the substrate due to the high density of screening electrons .",
    "concentration dependence of the exchange integrals @xmath39 for the first few shells of neighboring atoms @xmath40 is shown in fig .",
    "first , this figure illustrates the principal difference between the approach used in ref .   and the present approach . in the former method ,",
    "the total enegy differences between three magnetic configurations , namely the fm , @xmath3- and @xmath4-afm configurations , are used to estimate two exchange integrals .",
    "one can call this approach the first - principle fitting as compared to the direct first - principle calculation of exchange integrals in our present approach .",
    "clearly , realistic exchange integrals are not limited to the first two shells and , in particular , not in the two - dimensional case where exchange integrals can decay in general more slowly than in the three dimensional case ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "it should be noted that we have plotted the exchange integrals without corresponding degeneracies ( multiplicities of equivalent surface atoms in the shells ) that are 4 or 8 in the present case .",
    "the most remarkable feature observed in fig .  [ j5 ] is a dramatic change of the leading first nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interaction from the strongly afm coupling in fe@xmath37w(001 ) to the fm coupling in fe@xmath37ta(001 ) .",
    "the crossover between the afm and fm couplings roughly coincides with the crossover between the fm and afm ground state of the fe overlayer .",
    "the concentration dependence of other interactions on the substrate alloy composition is generally weak .",
    "the second nn interaction has the afm character in the whole concentration range while the third nn interaction is fm - like for a w - rich substrate .",
    "the first two nn interactions agree reasonably well with those fitted from total energies for three magnetic configurations @xcite both qualitatively and quantitatively ( note that the definitions of the heisenberg hamiltonian used in the present paper and in ref",
    ".   differ by a factor of two ) .",
    "the quantitative agreement of these nn interactions also proves that the chemical disorder in the taw alloy substrate , which ref .   treated in a simple virtual crystal approximation but which the present study treats in the cpa , is really weak .    in fig .",
    "[ j0 ] we compare the difference between total energies of the dlm and fm phases with the calculated exchange parameter @xmath31 , eq .",
    "( [ j0-sum ] ) , for the dlm reference state adopted in this paper .",
    "overall good agreement between both dependences over the whole concentration range should be pointed out .",
    "this confirms that the dlm state is a reasonable reference state for the estimate of exchange integrals .",
    "the small deviations are due to approximations inherent to the heisenberg model ( fixed size of local moments , the neglected contribution of induced moments in the substrate ) .",
    "the observed concentration trend of the first nn interaction and of the relative stability of the fm and dlm states can be understood qualitatively on the basis of general properties of a broad class of physical quantities in tight - binding models as functions of band filling .",
    "@xcite these quantities include , e.g. , total - energy differences , local and non - local susceptibilities , magnetic and chemical interactions , etc . ; all of them change their sign due to variation of the fermi energy across the @xmath5-band . in the present case , the position of the fermi level with respect to the fe @xmath5-band",
    "is directly controlled by the concentration of the ta - w alloy substrate .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ converg ] we illustrate the convergence of the exchange parameter @xmath31 , eq .",
    "( [ j0-sum ] ) , as a function of the number of shells included in the summation .",
    "note that now the shell degeneracies , @xmath41 , are included . obviously , the inclusion of about 20 nn shells is sufficient for practical purposes ( the deviation of the partial sum from the converged value is less than 1  % ) .",
    "at least 10 shells have to be considered in order to predict the formation of an incommensurate magnetic ground state of fe@xmath37ta@xmath42w@xmath43(001 ) ( see the next subsection for details ) .",
    "this is demonstrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ converg ] , where the lattice fourier transform @xmath44 of the real - space exchange interactions @xmath45 is magnified for the relevant wavevectors @xmath46 in the surface brillouin zone .",
    "the position of the minimum of the spin - spiral energy , i.e. , the wavevector @xmath46 for which @xmath44 has maximum , begins to approach the converged position for more than 10 shells while about 70 shells are needed to reach the converged position with the precision of @xmath47 of the wavevector @xmath46 .",
    "the first two dominating nn interactions are obviously not enough to reproduce this local spin - spiral energy minimum .",
    "let us consider a class of possible arrangements ( the so - called @xmath48waves ) of magnetic moments defined as @xmath49 where the polar angle @xmath50 is a constant and the azimuthal angle @xmath51 is a function of the position vector @xmath52 of site @xmath10 .",
    "the energy per lattice site corresponding to the hh ( [ hh - def ] ) @xmath53 is expressed in terms of the lattice fourier transform of the site - dependent exchange integrals @xmath54 it is easy to show that @xmath55 and that @xmath56 if the minimum of energy is achieved for @xmath57 . let us note that @xmath44 is closely connected to the energies of magnetic excitations ( magnons ) in the system decribed by the hh , eq .",
    "( [ hh - def ] ) .",
    "the maximum of @xmath44 , or , equivalently , the minimum of @xmath58 , reached for a particular value of the vector @xmath59 in the surface brillouin zone indicates a tendency of the magnetic system to form a magnetic ground state characterized by that wave vector @xmath60 .",
    "the wave vector @xmath61 ( point @xmath62 in the surface brillouin zone ) correponds to the fm ground state while a nonzero wave vector @xmath60 corresponds to a more complex ground state including possible afm or spin - spiral states .",
    "for example , @xmath60 at the point @xmath63 of the surface brillouin zone corresponds to the @xmath3 ( checkerboard - like ) afm ground state and @xmath60 at the point @xmath64 corresponds to the @xmath4 ( row - wise ) afm ground state .",
    "a minimum of @xmath58 outside any point of high - symmetry in the surface brillouin zone suggests a tendency to form an incommensurate ( spin - spiral ) magnetic ground - state structure .    in this way ,",
    "we are able to investigate the stability of a much broader class of magnetic systems as compared to the conventional total energy search . it should be noted , however , that possible more general ground states are not included in the present search and a more advanced search based on the overlayer heisenberg hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ hh - def ] ) , would be needed .",
    "finally , we mention that in the present study we neglect the anisotropic part of the effective magnetic hamiltonian , i.e. , the anisotropy that concerns orientation of the spins with respect to the underlying lattice .",
    "thus the relativistic effects ( the magnetic anisotropy and the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions ( dmi ) ) as well as the magnetostatic ( magnetic dipole - dipole ) interactions are missing in the present analysis",
    ". the dipole - dipole pair interactions between the first and second nn fe - fe pairs are at least two orders of magnitude weaker ( below 0.01 mev ) than the typical exchange interactions in the present case .",
    "however , their long range contributes significantly to formation of domain walls and it might influence other details of the magnetic order too .",
    "it is also known that the dmi can lead to long - range chiral structures due to weakening of fm - interactions , as it happens in the mn@xmath37w(110 ) @xcite and mn@xmath37w(001 ) @xcite systems .",
    "we note that in a consistent theoretical treatment all possible anisotropic terms would have to be included on the same footing .",
    "the curves of @xmath58 plotted in fig .  [ jq ] and",
    "especially the positions of their minima reflect the dependence of the magnetic ground state on the composition of the substrate . a clearly pronounced minimum for fe@xmath37w(001 ) at the @xmath63 point in the surface brillouin zone confirms the total energy search , namely that the checkerboard @xmath3-afm is the ground state of the system . with increasing ta content",
    ", the stability of the @xmath3-afm state weakens and for about 20  % of ta atoms a weak minimum corresponding to an incommensurate state ( with the wavevector on the line @xmath65 close to @xmath63 ) develops .",
    "it should be noted that this minimum is sensitive to the number of shells included in the evaluation of @xmath58 and is missing if we consider only few leading exchange interactions ( see previous subsection ) .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility , however , that this shallow local minimum will disappear when the relativistic effects are included .",
    "the magnetocrystalline anisotropy , for example , strengthens the tendency towards collinear afm alignment and competes with the dmi interaction which promotes the rotating , non - collinear magnetism as it was demonstrated recently for the fe - double chains on the fcc - ir(001 ) surface @xcite .",
    "if the ta content further increases , the @xmath4-afm configuration becomes the ground state as it is illustrated for the case with 50  % of ta atoms where the minimum of @xmath58 occurs at @xmath64 , see fig .",
    "[ jq ] . in the ta - rich alloy the stability of the fm phase increases as compared to the @xmath3 one until for fe@xmath37ta(001 ) the wave vector at @xmath62 ( or the fm state ) becomes the magnetic ground state .",
    "the observed tendency to a non - collinear ground state for @xmath66 can be explained by frustration effects on the square fe lattice accompanying the dominating first and second nearest - neighbor interactions that are both negative for concentrations @xmath67 , see fig .",
    "[ j5 ] . for w - rich substrates ( @xmath68 ) , the first nearest - neighbor interaction dominates ( @xmath69 ) and the @xmath3 afm ground state is not frustrated . for equiatomic concentrations ( @xmath70 ) ,",
    "the second nearest - neighbor interaction is the strongest one ( @xmath71 ) and the @xmath4 afm ground state is not frustrated either .",
    "however , for compositions around @xmath72 , both interactions are of comparable magnitudes ( @xmath73 ) which leads to pronounced frustration of these simple afm states .",
    "moreover , these afm states become nearly degenerate at @xmath74 , where the two leading interactions satisfy roughly a relation @xmath75 .",
    "@xcite the formation of a single-@xmath46 spin spiral for @xmath66 ( or of a more complex spin arrangement not considered here ) represents thus a natural consequence of existing interactions in the fe - monolayer .",
    "finally , the present results ( e.g. , the critical concentration for the afm to fm crossover ) can be influenced quantitatively by possible structural changes in real system .",
    "a recent study @xcite indicates a possibility for the b2-ordering in a bulk bcc - taw alloy over a broad concentration range .",
    "also , a smaller surface energy of bcc - ta as compared to the bcc - w @xcite together with the larger size of ta atoms seems to indicate a possibility for the segregation of ta - atoms at the bcc-(ta , w)(001 ) alloy surface . on the other hand , the qualitative conclusions of the present paper",
    "remain unchanged .",
    "we have developed a new approach to study the magnetic phase stability of magnetic overlayers on non - magnetic substrates .",
    "the approach consists in the evaluation of exchange integrals between local magnetic moments in the magnetic overlayer using the adiabatic approximation and the real - space green function approach .",
    "this allows us to use this approach also for magnetic overlayers on a random substrate and/or for random alloy magnetic overlayers .",

    "such a search allows one to investigate the stability of a much broader class of possible magnetic configurations as compared to the conventional total energy search which is limited to a few empirically chosen configurations .",
