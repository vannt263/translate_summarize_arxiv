    "wavelength multi / demultiplexers are central components in optical telecommunication networks , and they have been subject of intense research and development since the advent of wavelength - division multiplexing ( wdm ) in the early 90s@xcite .",
    "components for these networks are subject to demanding requirements , both in terms of performance and manufacturing .",
    "while performance depends on the particular component , all need to provide stable operation . in terms of manufacturing requirements ,",
    "a reproducible and mass fabrication process is mandatory .",
    "hence , photonic integration is usually the basis for large count wdm multiplexers .",
    "the cost of an integrated circuit is fundamentally related to its footprint @xcite , and it has a direct impact on the economies of scale for manufacturing , where in general more devices per wafer , i.e. more compact devices , are desired .    amongst the different implementations for multiplexers , the arrayed waveguide grating ( awg )",
    "@xcite is one of a few that aligns with the previous statements .",
    "traditionally manufactured on silica on silicon integration technology @xcite , it finds room nearly in all the relevant material platforms , such as indium phosphide , silicon on insulator , silicon and silicon nitride ( for a summary see @xcite ) .",
    "the physical layout of an awg consists of the combination of waveguides and slab couplers @xcite . in its most common shape ,",
    "two slab couplers with input / output waveguides are inter - connected by a set of waveguides , usually referred as arrayed waveguides ( aws ) .",
    "consecutive waveguides in the array have a length differing a constant amount , which imposes a wavelength - dependent lineal phase front on the signal fed from the first slab coupler .",
    "this linear phase front , in combination with the second slab coupler , enable the spatial separation of different wavelengths in different outputs .    in terms of footprint , other integrated multiplexer implementations as the echelle diffraction grating ( edg ) achieve considerable size reduction compared to the awg @xcite .",
    "the layout of an edg includes a single slab coupler , with input / output waveguides on one side , and a reflective grating on the opposite end .",
    "it is a so - called reflective multi / demultiplexer .",
    "one issue with edgs is to maximize the reflection on the grating , in order to minimize the overall insertion losses , issue which is otherwise not present in a regular awg .",
    "different approaches exist to increase the reflectivity of the grating in an edg , the most employed being the deposition of metal layers at the edge of the grating @xcite , or the addition to the grating of other structures such as bragg reflectors @xcite . while the former supplies broadband reflectors , it requires resorting to additional fabrication steps .",
    "conversely , bragg reflectors can be manufactured in the same steps that the edg , but it is well known the reflection bandwidth is inversely proportional to their strength @xcite .    similarly , awg layouts with reflective structures midway in the array , i.e. reflective awgs ( r - awg ) are possible as well .",
    "they can have a footprint ideally half of a regular awg , and closer to the one of an edg .",
    "hence , the signals travelling in the arrayed waveguides arrive to the reflectors , and are bounced back to the ( single ) slab coupler .",
    "although the functionality is the same than in the case of a regular awg , some additional design considerations are required @xcite .",
    "the reflectors can be implemented in similar ways to the ones for the edgs , and the literature shows solutions as reflective coatings on a fact of the chip where the arrayed waveguides end @xcite , photonic crystals @xcite , external reflectors @xcite and even bragg reflectors @xcite at the end of the arrayed waveguides .",
    "a common issue of all the described approaches for the reflector is that broadband full reflectivity requires additional fabrication steps , and therefore increases the final cost of the multiplexer . in this paper",
    "we propose a novel configuration for a r - awg , where the well known sagnac loop reflectors ( slr ) are used as reflective elements at the end of the arrayed waveguides .",
    "a slr is composed of an optical coupler with two output waveguides , that are connected to each other forming a loop .",
    "these reflectors are broadband , can supply total reflection , and can be fabricated in the same lithographic process than the rest of the awg .",
    "moreover , the reflection of a slr depends on the coupling constant of the coupler .",
    "hence , it can be different for each of the waveguides in the array .",
    "the modification of the field pattern in the arrayed waveguides of an awg allows for spectral response shaping , as for example box like transfer function @xcite and multi - channel coherent operations @xcite amongst other .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : model ] , the theoretical equations describing the full field ( amplitude and phase ) transfer function of the r - awg are developed , following the model in @xcite .",
    "the equations are then particularized for two cases : firstly , the case for which all the slrs have total reflection , and the awg response obtained is gaussian ; secondly , the case where the reflectivity of each slr is designed to be such a way that the field profile in the array is a sinc function as in @xcite to obtain a flat - top response at the output . in section [ sec : sims ] , the equations are used to design and simulate a r - awg on silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) technology .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] presents the summary and outlook .",

    "the layout consists of a group of input and output waveguides connected to one side of the ( single ) slab coupler .",
    "each of the arrayed waveguides , which are connected to the opposite side of the slab coupler , is terminated with a slr .",
    "the lengths of consecutive waveguides in array differ by a constant amount @xcite .",
    "the layout in fig .  [ fig : srawg ] includes a phase shifter ( ps ) section in between the waveguides in the array and the slr , the purpose of which will be detailed later on .    hence , this configuration allows for adjusting independently the field amplitude and phase in each aw .",
    "though the operation is similar to a regular awg , is summarized here for completeness .",
    "the field introduced through an input waveguide is diffracted in the slab coupler , and collected by the arrayed waveguides on the opposite side .",
    "then the light travels forth and back through each individual and independent aw , ps and slr . the reflection ( amplitude and phase ) in each slr can be different , depending on the coupling constant for the coupler .",
    "the overall reflected field reaching back the slab coupler will be diffracted by the aws .",
    "the overall phase relations between aws will determine the r - awg behaviour .",
    "in the most simple case , a constant phase difference between consecutive propagation paths in the array will spatially separate the different wavelengths on the input / output side of the slab coupler .      though well known , further details are given for the slr , for which a reference layout is shown in fig .",

    "note that the equations include a phase change due to the length of the loop , @xmath9 . for coupling constants @xmath10 other than 0.5",
    ", the reflected power will be less than 100% .",
    "the coupler for the slr can be implemented in multiples ways : directional coupler ( dc ) @xcite , wavelength insensitive coupler ( winc ) @xcite or multimode interference coupler ( mmi ) @xcite .",
    "the reflectors for the proposed r - awg need to be broadband , i.e. the coupling constant needs to be constant over a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "therefore only the winc and mmi couplers satisfy this condition .",
    "moreover , footprint considerations lead to the selection of mmi vs winc , since the latter is in general larger than the former .",
    "finally , mmis can be designed to have arbitrary coupling constant , as described in @xcite .",
    "different coupling constants may ultimately result in different mmi lengths / phase shifts .",
    "the purpose of the formerly introduced ps sections is to compensate the phase imbalances between aws due to different phase shifts / coupling constant / reflection between the slrs of the different aws . as the coupler",
    ", the phase shifter is required to be broadband .",
    "this is possible by means of regular straight waveguides , or by tapered waveguides as in @xcite .",

    "as expected , an increase in the channel bandwidth is attained at the expense of more insertion losses .      ) for each different profile applied at the aws.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    although the semi - analytical model in previous sections was only derived for the gaussian and flattened response cases , in principle it is possible to apply any desired field distribution for the aws , which will result in different spectral responses . in this subsection",
    "we present several field distributions and corresonding spectral responses , which we take from well - known fourier transform pairs . to be precise ,",
    "we targetted triangular , decaying exponential , truncated cosine and lorentzian spectral responses . fig .",
    "[ fig : field_k ] shows the required aws field distributions , i.e. at plane @xmath60 .",
    "note the legend labels are for the target transform pair , not the actual function employed in the field distribution for the aws .",
    "detailed expressions can be find elsewhere , as for instance in @xcite .",
    "similar to the previously shown case for the flattened response ( aws sinc distribution ) , the required coupling factors @xmath10 to be applied in each aw are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : field_k ] .",
    "note there is no plotted value for the gaussian case , since all the slrs are use @xmath71 for full reflection .",
    "an additional important remark is how the regular gaussian field distribution ingoing to the array is transformed into the targeted one . in principle",
    "some field distributions , can have amplitudes higher than those of the gaussian for some of the waveguides in the array .",
    "this would required amplification , which is not contemplated with the proposed slr - based layout .",
    "therefore , the targeted profile needs to be inscribed under the starting gaussian profile .",
    "hence , the amplitude in each aw needs to be reduced to inscribe the profile inside the gaussian , at the cost of more insertion losses .",
    "this is the result in fig .",
    "[ fig : field_k ] , where all the field profiles at the aws have amplitude levels below the starting gaussian distribution .",
    "the flat spectral response case developed in section [ subsubsec : flat ] shows the shape of the field at the output plane is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fmp ] ) .",
    "for all the targeted spectral responses , this far field at the output plane is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fosn_all ] for @xmath44 .",
    "the far field is not exactly the fourier transform pair of the aws field distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : field_k ] . as expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fmp ] ) , the field profiles at @xmath112 have a finite extensions ( i.e. a finite number of aws is employed ) , therefore the field profiles are truncated and the far field is in fact the convolution between a sinc function ( fourier transform of a truncation function in the array ) and the fourier transform of the profile applied at the aws . from all the curves in fig .  [ fig : fosn_all ] the triangular function case ( red line ) is the most suitable to understand this fact .",
    "ideally , for an infinity ( unpractical ) number of aws , one would expect a perfect ( sharp ) triangular shape , but in practice the truncation by a finite number of waveguides results in some smoothing in the curves .",
    "this is similar to the well - know problem of function approximation with fourier series using a finite number of terms .",
    "in addition to this intrinsic smoothing , the corresponding end - to - end transfer functions for the r - awgs involves the calculation of the convolution integral between the ( already smoothed ) far field at the output plane and the mode at the output waveguide , as described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tq ] ) .",
    "the transfer functions are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : t2_all_lineal ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : t2_all ] , using linear and logarithmic units , for one output waveguide , in this case o@xmath113 placed at a distance 2.24  @xmath109 m from the slab center .",
    "this paper proposes a novel type of reflective arrayed waveguide grating , that makes use of a configuration based on phase shifters and sagnac loop reflectors , build with an optical coupler with looped back waveguides .",
    "the layout enables the control of the field amplitude and phase per arm in the array , with the combination of phase shifters and slrs whose reflectivity is set through the coupling constant of the optical coupler . a theoretical model for the analysis and design of the device has been provided , both for the cases of gaussian and flattened response , the latter achieved by adjusting the aw field distribution to a sinc function by means of the slrs and phase shifters .",
    "the model was used to design and simulate silicon - on - insulator implementations using typical waveguide cross - sections for the technology .",
    "this was presented for the gaussian and flattened spectral response cases , as well as for different field distributions in the awg arms that result in principle with an arbitrarily customizable spectral response .",
    "we believe profiles in the aws can be found to pre - equalize the intrinsic spectral response smoothings described , in order to obtain closer to target spectral responses .",
    "the processing of photonic signals in the wavelength domain , i.e. multi - wavelength spectral filtering / shapping , is just one of the possible applications of this versatile and novel r - awg layout .",
    "we envisage more applications for which the field distribution in the aws is determinant , as the use of awgs for pulse rate multiplication , where the envelope of the train of pulses generated by the awgs is directly dictated by the field distribution in the arms @xcite .",
