    "the introduction of supersymmetry into classical mechanics has been motivated in part by the study of supersymmetric _ quantum _ mechanics , e.g. in the influential paper by witten @xcite , not the least with the aim to find a classical `` background '' for these models .",
    "that this can be achieved has been long known , namely that classical supersymmetric mechanics can be consistently constructed by replacing all dynamical quantities of the theory in question by even and odd elements of a grassmann algebra @xmath1 according to their respective bosonic or fermionic nature .",
    "this grassmann - valued mechanics has been studied first by berezin and marinov @xcite and casalbuoni @xcite . a more recent account devoted to one - dimensional systems",
    "was given by junker and matthiesen in @xcite .",
    "for a general review of grassmannian geometry the reader may turn to the book by de witt @xcite .",
    "an interesting but somewhat different approach has been taken in a series of papers by gozzi et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "using path integral methods in classical mechanics he and coauthors construct an @xmath2 supersymmetric theory for any given hamiltonian system , where fermionic fields correspond to sections of various cotangent and tangent bundles of the configuration manifold . it should be noted , however , that the resulting model differs from the one analyzed in this paper , so that solutions or symmetries can not be directly compared .    while there is thus a considerable amount of literature on supersymmetric mechanics and interest in the topic",
    "has grown recently , there is a surprisingly low number of specific models that have been investigated and solved .",
    "furthermore , attention is usually restricted to the case of one spatial dimension .",
    "an interesting exception on two - dimensional liouville systems is given in @xcite .",
    "we try in this paper to address both of these shortcomings , first by establishing some general properties of multidimensional supersymmetric mechanics , especially for centrally symmetric potentials and then by analyzing and solving a particular classical model , the coulomb problem .",
    "the @xmath3-potential is one of the oldest and most prominent potentials that has been studied in physics .",
    "this is not only since it properly describes both the gravitational and the electrical interaction of massive or charged point particles , respectively but also because it has some very attractive features .",
    "one example is that by a theorem of bertrand @xcite the attractive version of the potential is the only centrally symmetric potential next to the harmonic oscillator such that every admissable trajectory is closed .",
    "furthermore one can derive an explicit time - dependent solution for every given set of initial data .",
    "this is a very useful property because it implies , if perhaps unexpectedly at first sight , that the supersymmetric version of the theory can be explicitly solved , too .",
    "this paper is based on the experience gained from an earlier investigation into one - dimensional supersymmetric problems .",
    "both in @xcite and @xcite , where a different concept of complex conjugation for grassmann variables was used , one of the ideas of tackling the supersymmetric problem was the assumption of a _",
    "finitely _ generated grassmann algebra @xmath1 .",
    "this led to a layer - by - layer structure of the theory which could be used to solve one - dimensional models by subsequently solving higher layers based on the solutions of all lower ones .",
    "we shall take a similar approach in this paper .",
    "the starting point for our investigation will be the statement of the lagrangian in section [ coulomb ] .",
    "it is obtained ultimately from the familiar @xmath2 supersymmetric @xmath4-dimensional field theory with yukawa interaction via dimensional reduction which leads to the description of one - dimensional supersymmetric point particle mechanics analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the resulting lagrangian can then be generalized to more than one dimension .",
    "notice that supersymmetry requires the bosonic potential to be non - negative .",
    "this means that our attention has to be restricted to the case of repulsive interaction .",
    "we go on to derive the complete set of @xmath5 equations of motion and show that as in the one - dimensional model there are two independent supersymmetries as well as a purely fermionic invariance transformation which can be seen as an internal `` rotation '' of the fermionic variables .",
    "we proceed by giving one explicit solution to the fermionic equations of motion utilizing the supercharges  except in the one - dimensional case this can not be the complete solution , though .",
    "we then restrict our attention to a special class of models , namely those with a centrally symmetric scalar potential . after restating",
    "the equations of motion we derive in section [ centralpotentials ] the explicit form of the supersymmetric angular momentum and show that it is a supersymmetric invariant .",
    "the symmetries of our model can be understood best from its poisson algebra which we therefore describe completely in section [ poisson ] .    in section [ coulombproblem ]",
    "we write down the complete set of equations governing the supersymmetric coulomb problem . even in three dimensions",
    "these are still nine coupled first and second order differential equations and it seems by no means obvious that there will be an explicit analytical solution for every possible set of initial data .",
    "we use section [ solutions ] to show that such an explicit solution exists .",
    "this is achieved by utilizing a method originally employed in @xcite and then applied further in @xcite .",
    "the key idea is to decompose all dynamical quantities ( and therefore every equation ) into terms containing the same number of grassmann generators .",
    "the model then naturally obtains a layer structure which can be analyzed from the bottom layer ",
    "the classical problem  upwards .",
    "in particular , solutions to higher layers may be found by using all those already derived for the lower layers .",
    "we will carry out this programme here up to second order in the grassmann algebra  since our results indicate a close resemblance of the multi - dimensional to the one - dimensional case we can suspect that higher order solutions exhibit many of the characteristics described already for the one - dimensional case",
    ". we will give a short summary of these in our conclusions .",
    "as mentioned we begin our analysis in section [ sectionbottom ] with the bottom layer of the system which is identical to the classical , i.e. non - supersymmetrized problem .",
    "although the solutions to the problem are well - known we explain briefly how explicit time - dependent expressions can be found  we do this because the textbook treatments of the problem usually only derive the possible orbits but do not specify the actual functions of time that describe it .",
    "the fermionic equations of motion comprise the next layer and we study their solutions in detail in subsection [ fermionic - equations ] . as in the one - dimensional case",
    "we find that fermionic motion is not only compact but restricted to a spherical space .",
    "furthermore , while there is a plane of motion for the bosonic variables ( of lowest order ) the same is not true for the fermionic variables or , in other words , fermionic motion is non - trivial in all three spatial directions .",
    "finally , we solve the top layer of our system , consisting of the bosonic quantities of second order in the generators .",
    "though the particular solutions found in the one - dimensional case can not be applied directly to the coulomb problem we can carry over the most important aspect to the three - dimensional case , namely that solutions to the homogeneous equations of motion of the top layer system are _ variations _ of the bottom layer system with the free parameters of that motion .",
    "in particular , we show that every top layer solution to the homogeneous equations of the coulomb problem can be explained as a linear combination of the variations with initial time , energy , eccentricity , orientation of angular momentum and orientation of the hyperbola in the plane of motion .",
    "we conclude our analysis by a full statement of the explicit solutions of the inhomgeneous equations including the boson - fermion - interaction term .",
    "as is well - known , the classical coulomb problem exhibits a hidden @xmath6-symmetry as a consequence of which there is an extra vector - valued conserved quantity , the runge - lenz - vector .",
    "it comes as an unexpected surprise that this symmetry is broken in the supersymmetric version of the problem .",
    "we demonstrate this , i.e. that there can be no supersymmetric version of the runge - lenz vector , in the appendix .",
    "we assume that supersymmetric mechanical models can be described by the following lagrangian : @xmath7 which is a generalization of the familiar supersymmetric lagrangian in one - dimensional mechanics @xcite , ultimately derived from @xmath8-dimensional field theory .",
    "the dynamical quantities @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are @xmath12-component vectors , e.g. @xmath13 , @xmath9 is grassmann - even and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are grassmann - odd .    in addition , @xmath14 is taken to be a vector - valued @xmath12-component grassmann - even function of @xmath9 , so that @xmath15 is a @xmath16-tensor with elements @xmath17 . we will usually take this tensor to be symmetric which will always be the case if @xmath14 is derived from a scalar potential term as @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 denotes the standard euclidean inner product , extended if necessary in the obvious way : @xmath20 , being an @xmath16-tensor , stands e.g. for the component expression @xmath21 .",
    "the equations of motion can now be read off from the lagrangian : @xmath22 every equation is vector - valued and has @xmath12 components .",
    "invariance with respect to time - translation means that there is a conserved hamiltonian which can be calculated to be @xmath23 in addition there are two independent supersymmetry transformations , namely @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an infinitesimal scalar grassmann - odd parameter .",
    "the corresponding conserved supercharges are given by the expressions @xmath26 finally , an internal transformation in the fermionic part of the grassmann algebra , given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes an infinitesimal scalar grassmann - even parameter , also leaves the lagrangian invariant .",
    "the resulting charge is simply @xmath29    one of the results from @xcite , that can be carried over from the one - dimensional case almost without alteration , is that solutions to the fermionic equations can be found using the supercharges . in one dimension ( [ q ] ) and ( [ qtilde ] )",
    "can be formally inverted to yield : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the constant grassmann - valued energy .",
    "this is still a solution in the @xmath12-dimensional case , though special care has to be taken if the real part @xmath32 is zero .",
    "unlike the situation in one dimension , however , ( [ fermion1-solution ] ) and ( [ fermion2-solution ] ) give only part of the fermionic solution . in the multi - dimensional case",
    "there is still a @xmath33-dimensional solution space that needs to be determined .",
    "so far these formulae have been straightforward generalizations of formulae from the one - dimensional case .",
    "however , in more than one dimension there can be additional conserved quantities if there are extra symmetries in the system .",
    "we will now assume that the scalar bosonic potential @xmath34 is central , i.e. a function of @xmath35 only .",
    "this can be easily achieved by demanding that the scalar potential @xmath36 is a function of @xmath37 , for then @xmath38 will be of the form @xmath39 with @xmath40 denoting the unit vector @xmath41 .",
    "the equations of motion can now be written as follows : @xmath42{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\hat{x}$}}}\\nonumber\\\\ { \\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\dot{\\psi}}_{+}$}}}&=&-\\left(\\frac{w'}{{\\ensuremath{|\\mbox{\\boldmath$x$}|}}}\\right){\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\psi}_{-}$}}}-\\left(\\frac{w''{\\ensuremath{|\\mbox{\\boldmath$x$}|}}-w'}{{\\ensuremath{|\\mbox{\\boldmath$x$}|}}}\\right)({\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\psi}_{-}$}}}{\\ensuremath{\\!\\cdot\\!}}{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\hat{x}$}}}){\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\hat{x}$}}}\\label{fermion1-equation - central}\\\\ { \\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\dot{\\psi}}_{-}$}}}&=&\\quad\\left(\\frac{w'}{{\\ensuremath{|\\mbox{\\boldmath$x$}|}}}\\right){\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\psi}_{+}$}}}+\\left(\\frac{w''{\\ensuremath{|\\mbox{\\boldmath$x$}|}}-w'}{{\\ensuremath{|\\mbox{\\boldmath$x$}|}}}\\right)({\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\psi}_{+}$}}}{\\ensuremath{\\!\\cdot\\!}}{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\hat{x}$}}}){\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\hat{x}$ } } } , \\label{fermion2-equation - central}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the argument of @xmath43 is @xmath37 .",
    "note that the purely bosonic part of the problem is described just by the first term on the right hand side of ( [ boson - equation - central ] ) .    for convenience we will now restrict ourselves to the three - dimensional case relevant for the coulomb problem ,",
    "although our discussion should generalize easily to more than three dimensions .",
    "the particular form of the potential function @xmath43 means that there is an extra symmetry in the system , given by rotating both the bosonic and the fermionic variables by the same amount around the same axis @xmath44 .",
    "infinitesimally , we can write @xmath45;\\quad \\delta_{a}{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\psi}_{+}$}}}=\\epsilon[{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath$a$}}},{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\psi}_{+}$}}}];\\quad \\delta_{a}{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\psi}_{-}$}}}=\\epsilon[{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath$a$}}},{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\psi}_{-}$}}}],\\ ] ] where @xmath46 $ ] denotes the three - dimensional vector product , i.e. @xmath47^{i}=\\epsilon_{ijk}x_{j}y_{k}$ ] .    this leads to the conserved angular momentum : @xmath48-{\\ensuremath{\\frac{i}{2}}}\\left[{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\psi}_{+}$}}},{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\psi}_{+}$}}}\\right ] -{\\ensuremath{\\frac{i}{2}}}\\left[{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\psi}_{-}$}}},{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\psi}_{-}$}}}\\right].\\ ] ] note that the second and third term of @xmath49 are non - zero since @xmath10 and @xmath11 are grassmann - odd .",
    "it is an interesting observation that the strict condition for the existence of angular momentum is that @xmath43 is central . by choosing @xmath50",
    "we end up with a rotationally invariant bosonic potential @xmath51 but angular momentum is not conserved .",
    "finally we point out that the following two expressions are also time - independent : @xmath52{\\ensuremath{\\!\\cdot\\!}}[{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\psi}_{-}$}}},{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\psi}_{-}$}}}]\\\\ \\left([{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\psi}_{+}$}}},{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\psi}_{+}$}}}]{\\ensuremath{\\!\\cdot\\!}}{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\psi}_{+}$}}}\\right){\\ensuremath{\\!\\cdot\\!}}\\left([{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\psi}_{-}$}}},{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\psi}_{-}$}}}]{\\ensuremath{\\!\\cdot\\!}}{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath${\\psi}_{-}$}}}\\right ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ] which can be said to denote the product of the oriented `` areas '' and `` volumes '' of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . they do not , however , constitute independently conserved quantities as the first one is proportional to @xmath53 and the second one to @xmath54 .",
    "apart from invariance under time translation , another important aspect is that of invariance under supersymmetry .",
    "it can be shown directly that angular momentum and energy are supersymmetric invariants whereas e.g. the extra charge @xmath55 is not : @xmath56 here @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the two supersymmetry transformations introduced in equation ( [ susy ] ) and @xmath25 is a grassmann - odd infinitesimal parameter .",
    "for a better understanding of the symmetries of our mechanical system we will now derive the poisson - algebra of the problem .",
    "therefore , we must write down the definition of the poisson brackets for grassmann - valued quantities . to do this we have to introduce the canonical momenta @xmath59 and @xmath60 by @xmath61 for the specific choice of our model one finds immediately that @xmath62 the fact that the canonical momenta associated with the fermionic variables are up to a constant factor identical to these variables themselves means that @xmath63 and @xmath64 can not be expressed uniquely as a function of configuration and momentum variables separately .",
    "it is therefore sensible to view ( [ constraint ] ) as a constraint and replace all occurences of @xmath65 and @xmath66 accordingly .",
    "hamiltons equations can then be written as @xmath67 so that the poisson brackets for even quantities @xmath68 and odd quantities @xmath69 have to be : @xmath70 where summation over @xmath71 is implied .",
    "the result is the same as in @xcite if the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) is used to replace the occurences of @xmath65 and @xmath66 in the formulae given there .",
    "we can then calculate the brackets between the dynamical variables and find the only non - zero elements : @xmath72 from these we can finally determine the following algebra relations between all the conserved quantities : @xmath73",
    "the supersymmetric coulomb problem , characterized by an @xmath3 repulsive bosonic potential , can now be obtained from ( [ lagrangian ] ) by setting @xmath74 or equivalently by choosing @xmath75 in ( [ boson - equation - central])([fermion2-equation - central ] ) .",
    "it follows that the equations of motion now read : @xmath76 we will proceed to solve these equations for a grassmann algebra with two generators in the next section .",
    "the formulae for all the conserved quantities need not be written out again for our special choice of @xmath14 but it is worth mentioning the explicit form of the hamiltonian : @xmath77    in the purely bosonic case the coulomb potential admits a further well - known conserved quantity , the runge - lenz vector , given by : @xmath78-{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\hat{x}$}}}\\ ] ] unfortunately this extra conserved quantity does not seem to exist for the supersymmetric case .",
    "we will outline a proof for this in the appendix .",
    "we will now solve equations ( [ bose - coulomb])([fermi2-coulomb ] ) for the case of a grassmann algebra with two generators .",
    "in other words , we assume that all physical quantities take their values in an algebra that is spanned by two grassmann - odd elements @xmath79 and @xmath80 , satisfying the relations @xmath81 using a method similar to the one deployed in @xcite we split the bosonic variable @xmath9 into components according to the number of generators involved : @xmath82 taylor - expanding the potential function @xmath14 then gives us @xmath83 notice that all quantities are vector - valued",
    ". we will indicate components , if necessary , by lower indices .    the fermionic variables are time - dependent multiples of @xmath79 and @xmath80 since for the particular grassmann algebra chosen there can be no product of three or more generators .",
    "therefore in products of bosonic and fermionic quantities only bosonic terms of zeroth order in the generators contribute .",
    "writing @xmath84 both fermionic variables decompose into two terms with _ real - valued _ time - dependent coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively , where @xmath87 .",
    "the equations of motion for the coefficients are similar to ( [ fermi1-coulomb ] ) and ( [ fermi2-coulomb ] )  the only differences being that @xmath10 and @xmath11 have to be replaced by the component functions @xmath85 and @xmath86 and @xmath9 has to be replaced by @xmath88 .",
    "while the fermionic equations thus do not look much different after the decomposition the bosonic equation ( [ bose - coulomb ] ) splits in two , namely @xmath89 where @xmath90 does not contain @xmath91 .",
    "following @xcite we will now systematically solve these equations by working `` upwards '' from the bottom layer of the system ( [ bottom ] ) through the fermion equations ( [ fermi1-coulomb ] ) and ( [ fermi2-coulomb ] ) to the top layer ( [ top ] ) .",
    "the lowest order equation ( [ bottom ] ) is of course just the familiar equation of the coulomb problem .",
    "its solutions are the well - known hyperbolae in the plane orthogonal to the angular momentum vector @xmath49 ( if we set apart for a moment the special case @xmath92 ) . in order to make use of the solutions for the remaining equations it will be necessary to write them down in an explicit time - dependent fashion . to do this",
    "we utilize a method first devised by moser in @xcite for the kepler problem with a negative total energy and then extended to the positive energy case by belbruno @xcite .",
    "we can summarize these results adapted to our problem by saying that there is a diffeomorphism between the constant energy surface @xmath93 in the phase space of the coulomb problem and the tangent bundle of the upper ( or lower ) sheet of the hyperboloid @xmath94 specified in four - dimensional euclidean space by @xmath95 .",
    "this diffeomorphism takes geodesics on @xmath94 into solutions to ( [ bottom ] ) requiring only a change of the time variable .",
    "more explicitly , if we parametrize a geodesic on @xmath94 by @xmath96 and denote by @xmath97 its tangent , then @xmath98 transforms this geodesic into a solution of the kepler problem for the energy @xmath99 , when we assume the following transcendental relationship between the geodesic `` time''-parameter @xmath100 and physical time @xmath101 : @xmath102 solutions for arbitrary energy can then be obtained by the scaling @xmath103    every geodesic on @xmath94 can be mapped using an appropriate @xmath104-transformation into @xmath105 for the coulomb problem this equates to choosing the plane of motion and the orientation of the hyperbola in it .",
    "( note that for the specific parametrization chosen we have also fixed the origin of time . )",
    "specifically we get @xmath106 where @xmath107 represents the eccentricity of the hyperbola .",
    "the relationship between @xmath100 and @xmath101 is given by @xmath108 this equation can not be inverted analytically .",
    "one can read off from ( [ boson - solution ] ) that the motion is indeed hyperbolic , taking place in the with the focal points on the @xmath109-axis and the origin of time chosen such that @xmath110 at the point of closest approach to the potential centre .",
    "we just mention that @xmath49 is oriented in @xmath111-direction and ( for constant energy ) @xmath112 ; the scattering angle @xmath69 is determined by @xmath113 .",
    "there are two special cases worth mentioning , namely @xmath114 when the scattering angle @xmath69 is @xmath115 and the angular momentum is zero and @xmath116 when @xmath117 and the equations describe free motion at an infinite distance to the center of the potential .      to solve equations ( [ fermi1-coulomb ] ) and ( [ fermi2-coulomb ] ) for @xmath118 we can first go back to our general solutions ( [ fermion1-solution ] ) and ( [ fermion2-solution ] ) .",
    "they state in this circumstance that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are linear combinations of @xmath119 and @xmath120 with grassmann - odd coefficients .",
    "( note that we can safely assume @xmath121 due to the repulsive nature of the coulomb potential . )    to analyse the fermionic movement it is therefore sensible to look at the motion of @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the first interesting aspect is that if we combine velocity and potential in a six - dimensional vector @xmath122 then the motion of this vector takes place on @xmath123 , since @xmath124 for our particular solution , but @xmath125 trivially .",
    "this is in fact very similar to the one - dimensional problem where motion takes place on @xmath126 instead @xcite .",
    "if we project the motion into the @xmath127-plane then this two - dimensional vector describes a circle with center at @xmath128 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the motion starts for @xmath129 at the intersection of this circle with @xmath126 , running initially towards the origin but then bending towards the @xmath130-axis and reaching its nearest point to the origin at @xmath131 .",
    "then it turns back outwards and runs symmetrically to the other intersection point , reaching it at @xmath132 .",
    "the projection into the @xmath133-plane shows a different picture . due to the factor @xmath134 in ( [ coulombpotential ] )",
    "the motion starts and ends at the origin .",
    "it runs radially outwards along an asymptote determined by the angular momentum but then bends towards the @xmath135-axis , crossing it at time @xmath110 and returns to the origin in a symmetric way ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .    when we come back to solutions ( [ fermion1-solution ] ) and ( [ fermion2-solution ] ) we can immediately state that @xmath136 so that we know the asymptotic behaviour of these solutions .",
    "however , we can visualize the fermionic motion completely if we refer to the bosonic motion on @xmath123 .",
    "for this it is more convenient to use the real - valued components @xmath85 and @xmath86 than the grassmann - valued quantities .",
    "one advantage is that we can meaningfully define the length of these vectors : for example , @xmath137 is a conserved quantity arising from invariance of the component equations of motion under change of generators .",
    "note that because we are dealing with real - valued quantities now , none of the two products is zero .    to understand the close connection between the above - mentioned bosonic motion on @xmath123 and fermionic motion",
    "let us ignore the third components @xmath138 and @xmath139 for a moment , since , as we will later see , their equations decouple . combining the remaining fermionic terms into the vector - valued object",
    "@xmath140 we see that @xmath141 lies in the plane spanned by the bosonic vector @xmath142 and one specific orthogonal vector @xmath143 obtained by rotating @xmath144 by ninety degrees in the @xmath145-planes for @xmath146 .",
    "( we are neglecting the trivial third components here ) .",
    "the angle between @xmath141 and the two bosonic vectors is entirely specified by the two supercharges @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "( to be more precise , it is specified by their real - valued components @xmath149 and @xmath150 with respect to the two grassmann generators . for simplicity",
    ", we will not indicate this difference in our notation assuming that the precise meaning is always clear from the context . ) in other words , as the bosonic vector @xmath144 moves on @xmath123 , determined by the bosonic equation of motion , the fermionic vector simply follows this movement rigidly , its direction being fixed with respect to the bosonic vector and its orthogonal complement by the two supercharges .",
    "this result is very similar to the one - dimensional case where one finds similarly constructed bosonic and fermionic vectors corotating on @xmath126 .",
    "still , there is a major difference in more than one dimension .",
    "this lies in the fact that @xmath147 and @xmath148 do not specify the fermionic solutions uniquely .",
    "the solution in one dimension can be derived by inverting equations ( [ q ] ) and ( [ qtilde ] ) , yet in two or more dimensions this inversion is no longer possible .",
    "instead these two equations only specify the two angles between @xmath141 and the _ two _ bosonic vectors @xmath151 but not more .",
    "this means that the general @xmath141 ( again neglecting third components ) moves simultaneously on two regular four - dimensional cones with center at the origin and their symmetry axes @xmath144 and @xmath152 , respectively .",
    "as @xmath144 and @xmath152 move with time @xmath141 follows rigidly attached to the surface of both cones and thus lies on the intersection of them . in the particular solution that we gave above",
    "this intersection corresponds just to one point ( taken at fixed distance from the origin )  thus specifying this particular solution completely .",
    "however , in general the intersection of the two cones ( and @xmath123 ) will yield a one - dimensional sphere ( just as the intersection of two three - dimensional cones and @xmath153 is equivalent to a zero - dimensional sphere , i.e. two discrete points ) .",
    "all points on this sphere have the same combination of supercharges @xmath147 and @xmath148 , which means that there exists a one - dimensional space of degrees of freedom for the fermionic motion that is not determined by the supercharges .",
    "in fact , we will now derive a second solution to ( [ fermi1-coulomb ] ) and ( [ fermi2-coulomb ] ) that fixes the motion of @xmath141 on this one - dimensional space . since the particular solution involving the supercharges described above lies entirely in the @xmath144-@xmath152-plane we will now look for a solution in the plane orthogonal to it .",
    "( remember , that the space we are considering is four - dimensional . )",
    "this plane can be spanned by the two vectors : @xmath154 a straightforward ansatz for the second solution is @xmath155 , where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are grassmann - odd constants . yet",
    ", this ansatz turns out to be too simple and does not yield a solution .",
    "instead we have to allow for time - dependent coefficients of @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "in other words we make the assumption that @xmath160 where the @xmath161 are grassmann - odd functions of time which still have to be determined .",
    "inserting this ansatz into ( [ fermi1-coulomb ] ) and ( [ fermi2-coulomb ] ) we find that the equations of motion are satisfied as long as the coefficient functions @xmath162 obey the condition : @xmath163 this first order differential equation for @xmath161 can be solved by : @xmath164 where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are two grassmann - odd constants and @xmath165 this integral can not be evaluated analytically but it can be written in terms of the standard first elliptic integral @xmath166 as @xmath167 we can immediately read off from ( [ omega ] ) that @xmath168 is a monotonically growing function that converges to a constant as @xmath169 and that has only one zero at @xmath170 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath171 can be described by the formula @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the legendre function of first kind .",
    "there are two interesting limiting cases , namely @xmath114 and @xmath174 . because @xmath175 and @xmath176 is a finite",
    "constant we find that @xmath177 in the first and @xmath178 in the second case .",
    "in other words , @xmath179 is a monotonically falling function of @xmath180 , taking values in the interval @xmath181 $ ] .",
    "going back to equations ( [ lambda1-solution ] ) and ( [ lambda2-solution ] ) and inserting them into our ansatz ( [ fermion2-solution - general ] ) we find thus the result : @xmath182 which can be interpreted as follows ( substituting the real components @xmath141 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 for the grassmann - valued quantities , if necessary ) : in addition to motion in the @xmath185-plane the fermionic vector can also move in the plane orthogonal to it . as in the previous case",
    "it is rigidly attached to and corotating with two orthogonal bosonic vectors .",
    "the motion of these two vectors , however , is slightly more complicated than before .",
    "they are not rigidly connected to @xmath144 and @xmath152 in a vierbein but rather have a time - dependent phase ( unless the eccentricity tends to infinity so that our formulae describe a freely moving particle at infinite distance to the origin , in which case @xmath186 . )",
    "this phase changes in a continuous fashion between @xmath187 and @xmath179 , where @xmath179 depends on the eccentricity of the bosonic solution and takes its maximum value @xmath188 in case @xmath114 , i.e. in the absence of angular momentum .",
    "thus the second solution describes a circular motion orthogonal to the first but with a time - dependent phase difference with respect to the rigid frame provided by the bosonic vector @xmath144 and its three chosen orthogonals .",
    "we can think of this motion as parametrizing the motion on @xmath189 that we mentioned above .",
    "so far we have neglected the third components of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , those in the chosen direction of angular momentum , for which the bosonic movement is trivial ( i.e. @xmath190 ) .",
    "it was one of the results from @xcite that triviality of the bosonic solution does not extend to the fermionic solution and the same can be observed in the multidimensional case .",
    "since the bosonic motion takes place in the @xmath109-@xmath191-plane and therefore @xmath192 equations ( [ fermi1-coulomb ] ) and ( [ fermi2-coulomb ] ) simplify considerably : @xmath193 incidentally , up to a factor of two these are the same equations as ( [ lambda - equation ] ) and therefore have ( again up to a factor of two ) the same solutions : @xmath194 where @xmath195 and @xmath196 are two further grassmann - odd constants and @xmath168 is the same function as before .",
    "the only difference consists of the extra factor of two and is responsible for a slight change in the asymptotic behaviour : whereas the maximum phase obtained for @xmath197 still converges to zero for @xmath174 implying that @xmath198 and @xmath199 are both constants , this maximum phase now tends to @xmath115 rather than @xmath188 for @xmath114 meaning that for zero angular momentum @xmath200 and @xmath201 describe a full circle .",
    "so although there is no bosonic motion in the third direction ( to lowest order ) the fermions somehow `` see '' the bosonic potential and behave accordingly .",
    "in fact , we can think of ( [ fermion3-equation ] ) as fermionic equation of motion for a one - dimensional coulomb potential  the only difference is that the strength of this potential is quadrupled with respect to the original problem . to see this we have to interpret the right - hand sides of ( [ fermion3-equation ] ) as @xmath202 where @xmath203 is given by @xmath204 thus the imagined one - dimensional bosonic potential has to be @xmath205",
    "this can be seen as an explanation for the extra factor of two appearing in the solutions ( [ fermion3-solution1 ] ) and ( [ fermion3-solution2 ] ) .",
    "we want to finish this section by a short discussion of the newly found fermionic constants @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 since there is a major difference between them and the supercharges @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "formally we can write all four constants as conserved quantities by simply inverting equations ( [ fermion2-solution - general ] ) , ( [ lambda1-solution ] ) , ( [ lambda2-solution ] ) , ( [ fermion3-solution1 ] ) and ( [ fermion3-solution2 ] ) .",
    "however , they can not be seen as an original symmetry of the lagrangian , in the sense that they can not be derived as noether charges by a variation just involving the dynamical variables . on the contrary , to derive those charges from the lagrangian we have to presuppose a certain knowledge of the system , e.g. the orientation of angular momentum , to find the correct variation .",
    "as an example , @xmath195 and @xmath196 can be formally found as conserved quantities using the following variation : @xmath206 evidently , neither function on the right hand side is a function of the dynamical variables only , instead we find a rather complicated function of time involving @xmath168 .",
    "in addition this variation would have to be different if we would alter the initial data of the bosonic motion , for example , by making a different choice for the orientiation of angular momentum .",
    "thus @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 should be seen as `` lesser '' charges , not comparable with the two supercharges @xmath147 and @xmath148 which are genuine noether charges as we have seen above .",
    "there are , however , some interesting observations about the interrelation of these extra fermionic quantities to be made .",
    "firstly , one can read off from ( [ fermion3-solution1 ] ) and ( [ fermion3-solution2 ] ) that the product @xmath207 or , more generally , @xmath208 is conserved , where @xmath209 denotes the bottom layer angular momentum .",
    "this is a consequence of the symmetry @xmath210 since we have restricted ourselves to two grassmann generators we can replace @xmath209 simply by @xmath49 and so find a genuine symmetry of the lagrangian , involving only the dynamical quantities .",
    "moreover , between all six fermionic constants mentioned there then exists the remarkable relation @xmath211 where , as we have seen , the bosonic constants @xmath55 and @xmath31 are genuine noether charges for arbitrary grassmann algebra .",
    "we finally have to solve equation ( [ top ] ) for the bosonic top layer , concentrating first on the homogeneous part of this equation , i.e. ignoring @xmath212 .    in the one - dimensional case there were two solutions to the analogue of this equation , namely @xmath213 whereas the first term is still a solution to the three - dimensional problem , the second one is not . a more fruitful generalization from the one- to the multidimensional case",
    "is given by the idea that solutions to the top layer equation describe variations of the bottom layer system with the free constants of that motion .",
    "we will explain this idea in more detail below .    to find an explicit form for the solutions we try the following ansatz @xmath214 inserting this ansatz into ( [ top ] ) and using the bottom layer equation ( [ bottom ] ) we can evaluate both sides and write them as time - dependent linear combinations of @xmath88 and @xmath119 .",
    "comparison of the coefficients then yields the two relations @xmath215 integrating equation ( [ aux - top - solution2 ] ) and inserting the result @xmath216 into ( [ aux - top - solution1 ] ) we get the following equation for @xmath217 : @xmath218 we can recognize that the homogenous part of this equation is nothing else than the bottom layer equation and this means that we can write its two solutions as the two component solutions of ( [ bottom ] ) given in ( [ boson - solution ] ) . since the inhomogenous solution is just the constant @xmath219 we can write @xmath220 applying this result to ( [ f2 ] ) we find that @xmath221 where @xmath222 inserting these results back into our ansatz ( [ xone - ansatz ] ) we find that @xmath223    there are still two solutions to ( [ top ] ) missing .",
    "as all solutions found so far lie in the plane of motion spanned by @xmath224 and @xmath225 we have to look now at solutions in the third direction , i.e. for @xmath226 .",
    "the equation of motion simplifies here to @xmath227 since @xmath228 .",
    "again this is just the bottom layer equation of motion , solved by @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "the general solution to the homogenous part of ( [ top ] ) is thus given by ( [ xone - solution ] ) and @xmath231    when we look for an interpretation of these solutions the analogy with the one - dimensional case will be  as mentioned  quite fruitful . in one dimension the solution to the homogenous part of the @xmath232-equation could be written as a sum of variations : @xmath233 the same turns out to be true in the three - dimensional case .    to start with , the term with coefficient @xmath234 in ( [ xone - solution ] )",
    "can be clearly interpreted as variation of our bottom layer solution with initial time @xmath235 : @xmath236    variation with energy can also be found in the solution for @xmath91 as can be seen in the following way : while solution ( [ boson - solution ] ) is valid only for energy @xmath237 we can obtain a solution for arbitrary energy @xmath31 by scaling both @xmath88 and @xmath101 according to ( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "the variation of @xmath88 with energy is then obtained by comparing @xmath238 with @xmath239 : @xmath240 evaluating this result at @xmath237 yields @xmath241 leaving us with the term in ( [ xone - solution ] ) with coefficient @xmath242 .",
    "it is quite important to realize that we have to compare two solutions of different energy at the _ same _ physical time @xmath101 , i.e. we must not change clocks and use @xmath243 as a parameter for the solution @xmath244 .",
    "these two variations comprised the homogenous part of the solution to the one - dimensional problem .",
    "for the coulomb problem there are four more independent ways to vary the bottom layer solution .",
    "one of these consists of rotating the hyperbolic orbit in the plane of motion by a small angle @xmath245 around the angular momentum axis .",
    "the variation is thus given by @xmath246 this variation coincides with a linear combination of two terms in ( [ xone - solution ] ) , namely @xmath247.\\ ] ] we can thus interpret the term with coefficient @xmath248 in ( [ xone - solution ] ) as a combination of rotation in the plane of motion and variation of the initial time parameter .    another way to vary @xmath88 is to change the eccentricity of the hyperbola which is explicitly included as a parameter in the solution ( [ boson - solution ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath249 where we have used that @xmath250 we again find this variation as a linear combination of two terms in ( [ xone - solution ] ) , namely : @xmath251,\\ ] ] and so the the @xmath252-term in ( [ xone - solution ] ) describes a combination of variation with eccentricity and energy .",
    "it is now to be expected that the two remaining terms of the homogenous @xmath91-solution are connected to a tilt of the plane of motion or , equivalently , to a change in the orientation of angular momentum @xmath209 : @xmath253 here @xmath254 and @xmath255 represent unit vectors in the respective directions .",
    "we find that @xmath256 which are evidently proportional to the two terms in ( [ xone - solution2 ] ) since @xmath209 is oriented in the third direction in our particular solution to the bottom layer system .",
    "thus we have now derived and found an interpretation for all the terms of the homogeneous solution to the top layer system . as was the case for one - dimensional systems this solution describes all the possible variations of the bottom layer with all possible parameters describing this layer . in our case",
    "we need six parameters to describe the motion of the original coulomb problem ( initial time , energy , eccentricity , orientation of major axis and two parameters describing the plane of motion ) and correspondingly there are six independent solutions to the top layer .",
    "the last step is now to find one particular solution to the inhomogenous equation ( [ top ] ) .",
    "the general idea is to take linear combinations of the inhomogeneous terms @xmath257 , integrate them over time and multiply them by one of the solutions @xmath258 of the homogeneous equation , then sum over all solutions : @xmath259 we determine the coefficient functions @xmath260 by two conditions : firstly , in taking the time derivative we want to get @xmath261 i.e. all the terms involving derivatives of the integrals must cancel out each other .",
    "then for the second time derivative we arrive at @xmath262 because the @xmath263-terms satisfy the homogeneous equation the first sum will give the homogeneous part of ( [ top ] ) .",
    "for the next term to give the inhomogeneous part we need the second condition that the sum in parenthesis is equal to the unit vector @xmath264 .",
    "we will now demonstrate this procedure : for simplicity we begin with the third component of @xmath91 .",
    "since it decouples from the other components we can safely assume @xmath265 , i.e. writing @xmath266 instead of @xmath267 we can make the ansatz @xmath268 our first condition then yields @xmath269 and thus we can set @xmath270 and @xmath271 .",
    "then we find @xmath272 and so by equating @xmath273 we end up with the required result , namely @xmath274 since the equations for the first and second components are coupled we need all four remaining homogenous solutions to give the correct inhomogeneous term .",
    "we just write down the result : @xmath275.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because we know both the bottom layer bosonic and the fermionic quantities contained in @xmath44 we can now in principle insert these into the integrals and evaluate the solutions as explicit functions of time . however , since the knowledge of these functions does not provide new insights , we refrain from writing them down here .    in summary ,",
    "the complete solution to the top layer bosonic equation is given by the sum of the homogeneous solutions ( [ xone - solution ] ) and ( [ xone - solution2 ] ) and the inhomogeneous solution given by ( [ inhomogen - solution1 ] ) and ( [ inhomogen - solution2 ] ) .",
    "our aim in this paper has been not only to analyze and solve a fascinating problem in supersymmetric classical mechanics but also to stress the relations between supersymmetric mechanical models in one and more than one dimensions .",
    "an example is that the fermionic variables should really be thought of as components of a @xmath276-dimensional vector @xmath277 which moves on a @xmath278-sphere . in the one - dimensional case",
    "this means that all fermionic vectors move on circles  which is consistent with our findings in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the motion is coupled to the motion of a purely bosonic vector , made of the dynamical variables @xmath279 and @xmath14 , by the supercharges . while these completely determine the fermionic motion in one dimension",
    "we have seen that the situation in higher dimensions is more complicated and the supercharges only prescribe a geometric subspace for the true solution . motion on this subspace is then no longer characterized by the rigid connection of bosonic and fermionic motion found in the one - dimensional case but exhibits a rather interesting time - dependent phase .",
    "we have shown that for rotationally invariant scalar potentials there will always be a conserved angular momentum so that to lowest order bosonic motion takes place in a plane .",
    "it is not unreasonable to conjecture that for every direction orthogonal to that plane we will have to solve a one - dimensional problem for the fermionic quantities corresponding to that direction  as was the case for the coulomb problem .",
    "this leads us to another generalization from the one - dimensional case , namely that trivial solutions to the bosonic equations of motion do not imply that the corresponding fermionic equations can only be solved trivially .",
    "in fact , for our particular problem we found that the third components of the fermionic quantities still `` felt '' the presence of the bosonic motion in the plane orthogonal to them .",
    "one of the most fruitful ideas for the higher bosonic layers which can be applied in any dimension turned out to be that solutions for these layers are variations of the solutions of the classical problem . while in one dimension every solution can be conveniently described by the energy and some choice for the initial time , in higher dimensions more of these parameters",
    "are needed  in case of the coulomb problem we have conveniently related them to the elements describing the classical orbit .",
    "so the view taken in @xcite for the one - dimensional case , namely that supersymmetric dynamics captures information over a whole range of _ energies _ of the system , can be confirmed in a more general sense for our higher dimensional model : the bosonic ( but grassmann - valued ) part of the solution describes not only one particular classical solution ( by its component of order zero ) but also includes all possible variations of it with all possible free parameters or , in other words , a bosonic solution corresponds not just to a point in the real parameter space but to something like a fuzzy subset .    for reasons of simplicity",
    "we have described in this paper solutions for a grassmann algebra with two generators . from our experience with the one - dimensional model and the clear links that it exhibits to the three - dimensional system we have studied in this paper",
    ", we conjecture that the picture for a larger number of generators is similar to that in the one - dimensional case .",
    "there we were able to show that solutions to the fermionic equations corresponding to three generators consist of two parts : one that looks like the first order solutions themselves ( i.e. movement on a circle in one dimension ) and one that consists of the _ variations _ of these solutions with energy and initial time .",
    "similarly , the bosonic equations for four generators are solved by the first and second variations of the lowest order bosonic solutions _ and _ first variations of the interaction term .",
    "it is therefore not unreasonable to assume that the general picture in three dimensions is not much different and that the higher order equations of motion can be solved by a suitable combination of ( first and higher order ) variation terms with respect to the free parameters of the physical model in question .",
    "in this section we want to outline a proof that the supersymmetric coulomb problem discussed in this paper does not admit a conserved runge - lenz vector . in the classical problem this conserved quantity can not be constructed as a noether charge but arises as a consequence of the hidden @xmath104-symmetry of the problem , explicitly recognizable in our construction of the bottom layer solution to the equations of motion in section [ sectionbottom ] .",
    "this symmetry must be broken in the supersymmetric case .",
    "we start with the assumption that there is a conserved runge - lenz vector in the supersymmetric problem . setting all fermionic variables to zero ( for our choice of grassmann algebra",
    "this can be accomplished by choosing @xmath280 ) we expect to get the classical result for this vector , namely @xmath281-{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\hat{x}$}}},\\label{runge - lenz}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is given just by its bosonic part @xmath282 $ ] .",
    "( we will use @xmath283 for this section ) .",
    "notice that the hamiltonian and the angular momentum vector also have this property .",
    "of course , here all quantities are grassmann - even rather than real , but this makes no difference and , of course , ( [ runge - lenz ] ) is a conserved quantity if we set all fermionic terms in the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) to zero .",
    "returning now to the general case with non - trivial fermionic variables we take the time - derivative of ( [ runge - lenz ] ) and find ( still taking the classical result for @xmath49 ) : @xmath284.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the result is clearly non - zero but then we can expect the supersymmetric version of the runge - lenz vector to have an additional fermionic piece",
    ". however , the derivative of this piece should yield exactly the same result as above with an extra minus sign so that the derivative of the total will be zero and hence @xmath285 a conserved quantity .",
    "we will now try to construct this fermionic piece .",
    "we start by writing our result for the bosonic part of @xmath285 in components , so that the linearity in @xmath59 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be seen in a more explicit way : @xmath286 we now try to assemble all terms whose derivative could possibly contribute to this result .",
    "fortunately , there are restrictions as to which terms to consider that shorten the list of expressions to look at .",
    "firstly , we need only to analyze terms quadratic in the fermionic variables : since @xmath285 is even their number has to be divisible by two , all terms containing no fermionic quantities at all can be assumed to be contained already in ( [ runge - lenz ] ) and if there were four or more fermionic variables in @xmath285 the time derivative would still contain the same number of these variables in contradiction to ( [ rv - decomposition ] ) .",
    "furthermore since our system is symmetric under the exchange @xmath287 we have to include only terms subject to this symmetry .",
    "this leaves us with multiples of the terms @xmath288 when we now classify all terms according to the type of their fermionic part and the even or odd number of @xmath289-variables involved in each one of them , then the time derivative can be seen as acting on these classes as follows :    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     here @xmath289 even / odd means the number of @xmath289-variables contained in a term is even or odd , respectively .",
    "since we want to derive a term of type a with an _ odd _ number of @xmath289 s , namely just one , we can read off from the summary above that we need not consider combinations of type ii or iii , since their time derivatives do not yield such a term nor can they compensate the b - terms that will arise from combinations i or iv .",
    "this means we only have to consider these latter combinations .",
    "however , even those are not unproblematic : as mentioned , they give rise to fermionic terms of type b which we do not want in our derivative , so we must hope that we can cancel these terms against each other .    in the next step",
    "we make  preliminarily  the assumption that the number of @xmath289-variables involved is either zero or one .",
    "we will later see that allowing for higher powers of @xmath289 will not change anything .    up to this point the allowed combinations left are @xmath290 we now have to contract these with the remaining natural tensors , namely @xmath291 and @xmath292 , to leave only one free index .",
    "for terms of type a ) we have the following options : @xmath293,@xmath294 , @xmath295,@xmath296 .    for terms of type",
    "b ) we have some extra restrictions : first , since they are antisymmetric under the exchange @xmath297 we need not to consider @xmath291-terms that contract the two fermionic variables .",
    "second , if we include any @xmath298-term the time - derivative will automatically yield an additional @xmath289-term so that the result would be quadratic in the @xmath289 s  a case which we have excluded above . therefore the only option left for combination b ) is @xmath299",
    ".    we still have to determine the prefactor of each term .",
    "it can be derived by dimensional arguments . as can be read off from the coulomb - hamiltonian ( [ coulomb - hamiltonian ] )",
    "the dimension of energy is @xmath300 . from this",
    "we can calculate the dimension of every other dynamical quantity : @xmath301    since the bosonic part of the runge - lenz vector is dimensionless we have to multiply each candidate term for the fermionic part by the appropriate factor of @xmath302 to make it dimensionless , too .",
    "we end up with the list in the first column of the following two tables .",
    "these tables describe the action of the time - derivative on each candidate term . in the top rows",
    "we have specified all tensorial combinations that can possibly be generated by applying the time - derivative to the candidate terms in the first column .",
    "the table itself then specifies the correct numerical prefactors of each tensor in the time - derivative of a particular candidate term .",
    "for example , one can read off from the table entries for the third term that @xmath303 for comparison we have added the bosonic part of the runge - lenz vector and the tensor decomposition of its time - derivative in the last row .",
    "the result is the following :    @xmath304    we now have to choose appropriate coefficients for the candidate terms such that their sum equals the bosonic part of @xmath285 ( with an extra minus sign ) .",
    "looking at the coefficients of @xmath305 and @xmath306 we can immediately see that terms 2 ) and 3 ) can not occur since these tensorial combinations are not part of the bosonic runge - lenz vector and can not be compensated by any other term . looking then at the second table",
    "we can conclude that term ( 5 ) can not occur either  since it contributes a non - zero factor to both columns whereas @xmath285 does not ( and the terms 2 ) and 3 ) have to be zero as deduced above ) .",
    "the column for @xmath307 tells us that the coefficient of the fourth term has to be @xmath308  in contradiction to the column for @xmath309 which says that the same coefficient has to be @xmath310 .",
    "similar contradictions arise for our first candidate term when we compare the columns for @xmath311 , @xmath312 , @xmath313 and @xmath314 .",
    "this leaves us no other option than to conclude that none of our candidate terms can be added to the bosonic part of the runge - lenz vector to achieve a zero derivative .",
    "one loophole remains .",
    "we have excluded further terms of type b ) on the grounds that they yield terms quadratic in momentum .",
    "we might hope , however , that in the right combination these quadratic terms can cancel each other .",
    "there are two possibilities , which can be found in the first column of the following table ; all other tensorial combinations either yield zero or are up to minus sign identical to the two choices below via the index exchange @xmath297 . on taking the time derivative of both terms",
    "the crucial issue is whether the terms quadratic in @xmath289 can be cancelled against each other , so only quadratic components are shown here : @xmath315 evidently , the quadratic terms do not cancel each other .",
    "we conclude that no term at most linear in momentum exists that could be added to @xmath316 to give a conserved quantity in the supersymmetric model .",
    "we can of course ask the question whether the fermionic part of the runge - lenz vector could be quadratic or of some higher power in @xmath317 .",
    "we will now show that the answer to this question is no .",
    "the reason for this can be understood by looking at a general term like @xmath318 where @xmath319 ( @xmath320 is a free index ) is a tensor constructed from two types of building blocks , @xmath321 and @xmath322 , and @xmath323 is some well - determined power of @xmath324 .",
    "since the tensor is of type a we can infer that the number @xmath325 of momentum variables has to be even .",
    "furthermore , to keep ( [ candidate - runge - lenz ] ) dimensionless @xmath323 has to be @xmath326 . clearly for every @xmath327 @xmath323 is a non - trivial function of @xmath324 .",
    "this in turn means that the time - derivative in acting on @xmath323 will produce an extra @xmath317 variable .",
    "there are only two ways to solve this problem : either all the terms in the time derivative of ( [ candidate - runge - lenz ] ) containing extra momentum variables cancel each other  or we have to make use of yet higher powers of @xmath317 in @xmath328 to compensate .",
    "however , those very terms will by the same principle give rise to another extra power of @xmath317 in the derivative and so on . for this series to stop at some point",
    "we must hope that all terms in the derivative of @xmath319 with @xmath329 momentum variables cancel each other .",
    "we find that @xmath330 where the dots indicate further terms containing less than @xmath331 momentum variables , in which we are not interested here .",
    "as mentioned above @xmath319 consists of a sum of tensors built from @xmath321 and @xmath322 terms . while the time derivative does not act on the first type of term , it acts on the second : @xmath332 thus we can write @xmath333 where @xmath334 is a new tensor derived from @xmath319 in the following way , which can be seen as an algebraic version of the leibniz rule : we replace one @xmath322 tensor in @xmath319 with @xmath335 , repeat this step for all other @xmath322 tensors contained in @xmath319  replacing always one tensor at a time  and then sum up every contribution .",
    "therefore @xmath336 so , if we want a cancellation of all terms containing @xmath331 momentum variables , we need : @xmath337 it remains to show that this equation can not be satisfied .",
    "starting with @xmath338 we find @xmath339 inserting these results into ( [ rl - condition ] ) we find the necessary condition @xmath340 , i.e. @xmath341 which is a clear contradiction , so a term like ( [ rl - test ] ) can not occur .",
    "replacing two @xmath342 terms by a @xmath57-tensor we arrive at @xmath343 to name but one possible choice .",
    "the corresponding @xmath344 is then given by @xmath345 where the dots indicate further terms which contain less than @xmath329 @xmath342-tensors .",
    "equation ( [ rl - condition ] ) then yields @xmath346 , which is again a contradiction .",
    "one can now see that as we subsequently replace two @xmath342-terms by one @xmath57-tensor , equation ( [ rl - condition ] ) gives that @xmath347 , where @xmath348 is the total number of @xmath342-terms exchanged as compared to ( [ rl - test ] ) .",
    "but this shows that @xmath325 has to be an odd integer in contradiction to our demand that @xmath325 be an even number . as a result",
    "no type a tensor can have the maximal number of momentum variables in the fermionic part of the runge - lenz vector .",
    "we refrain from repeating the argument for type b tensors since the result is the same : the time - derivative in acting on these tensors increases the number of @xmath317-variables by one and there is no way to cancel all these extra unwanted terms against each other .",
    "we can therefore safely conclude that even the introduction of higher orders of momentum does not change the overall result , namely that a supersymmetric version of the runge - lenz vector does not exist .",
