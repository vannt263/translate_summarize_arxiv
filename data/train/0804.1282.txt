    "the mass of a star is its most fundamental property .",
    "however , a direct measurement is possible in a small number of binary stars only .",
    "white dwarfs , neutron stars and stellar mass black holes are the fibal products of stellar evolution . in most binaries such faint , compact objects are outshone by their bright companions and therefore their orbital motion can not be measured .",
    "only lower limits to the companion mass can be derived . with the analysis method shown here , these limitations can be partly overcome .",
    "subluminous b stars are considered to be helium core burning stars with very thin hydrogen envelopes and masses around @xmath2 .",
    "different formation channels have been discussed . as it turned out , a large fraction of the sdb stars are members of short period binaries @xcite . for these systems",
    "common - envelope ejection is the most probable formation channel @xcite . in this scenario",
    "two main - sequence stars of different masses evolve in a binary system .",
    "the heavier one will first reach the red giant phase and fill its roche lobe .",
    "if the mass transfer to the companion is dynamically unstable , a common envelope is formed . due to friction the two stellar cores loose orbital energy , which is deposited within the envelope and leads to a shortening of the binary period . eventually the common envelope is ejected and a close binary system is formed , which contains a helium core burning sdb and a main sequence companion .",
    "when the latter reaches the red - giant branch , another common envelope phase is possible and can lead to a close binary with a white - dwarf companion and an sdb star .",
    "all known companions of sdb stars in such systems are white dwarfs or late - type main - sequence stars .",
    "if massive stars are involved , the primary may evolve into a neutron star ( ns ) or a black hole ( bh ) rather than a white dwarf . since massive stars",
    "are very rare , only few sdb+ns or sdb+bh systems are expected to be found .    since the spectra of most binary sdbs are single - lined , they reveal no information about the orbital motion of their companions , and thus only their mass functions can be calculated .",
    "@xmath3    although the rv semi - amplitude @xmath4 and the period @xmath5 are determined by the rv curve , two of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 remain free parameters .",
    "binary population synthesis models @xcite indicate a possible mass range of @xmath6=0.30@xmath90.48m@xmath10 for sdbs in binaries , which underwent the common envelope ejection channel .",
    "the mass distribution shows a sharp peak at about @xmath11 .",
    "this theoretical value can be backed up by observations ( edelmann these proceedings ; vuckovic et al .",
    "these proceedings ) as well as asteroseismology ( e.g. charpinet et al .",
    "these proceedings ) .    for close binary systems ,",
    "the components stellar rotational velocities are considered to be tidally locked to their orbital motions , which means that the orbital period of the system equals the rotational period of the companions . if the companions are synchronized in this way the rotational velocity @xmath12 can be calculated .",
    "@xmath13    the stellar radius @xmath14 is given by the mass  radius  relation .",
    "@xmath15    the measurement of the projected rotational velocities @xmath16 therefore allows us to constrain the systems inclination angles @xmath17 . with @xmath6 as free parameter",
    "the mass function can be solved and the inclination angle as well as the companion mass can be derived . because @xmath18 , a lower limit for the sdb mass is given . to constrain the system parameters in this way it is necessary to measure @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 with high accuracy .",
    "ten stars were observed at least twice with the high - resolution spectrograph uves at the esovlt .",
    "additional observations were made at the esontt ( equipped with emmi ) , the calar alto observatory 3.5-m telescope ( twin ) and the 4-m wht ( isis ) on la palma .",
    "two of the stars ( pg1232@xmath9136 , tons183 ) were observed with the high resolution feros instrument at the 2.2 m eso telescope at la silla .",
    "the radial velocities ( rv ) were measured by fitting a set of mathematical functions ( gaussians , lorentzians and polynomials ) to the hydrogen balmer lines .",
    "sine curves were fitted to the rv data points using a @xmath21 minimising method ( singular - value decomposition ) and the temporal power spectrum was generated to obtain a best - fit period ( table  1 ) .",
    "the spectra were corrected for the measured rv and co - added .",
    "atmospheric parameters were determined by fitting simultaneously each observed hydrogen and helium line with a grid of metal - line blanketed lte model spectra .",

    "( these proceedings ) . @xmath24 orbital parameters of this system taken from @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in order to derive @xmath16 , we compared the observed spectra with rotationally broadened , synthetic line profiles .",
    "the latter were computed using the linfor program @xcite . since",
    "sharp metal lines are much more sensitive to rotational broadening than balmer or helium lines , all visible metal lines were included . a simultaneous fit of elemental abundance and projected rotational velocity was performed separately for every identified line using the fitsb2 routine @xcite .",
    "the mean value and the standard deviation were calculated from all measurements .",
    "seeing induced variations in the instrumental profile and the noise level were the dominant error sources .",
    "information on the actual seeing conditions for every exposure have been extracted from the eso seeing monitor archive .",
    "all other possible sources of systematic errors turned out to be negligible .",

    "we adopt the mass range from @xcite , marked by the dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ t19:lock1 ] .",
    "there are no spectral signatures of companions visible .",
    "main sequence stars with masses higher than @xmath26 could therefore be excluded because they would contribute to the total flux and could therefore be identified from the spectral energy distribution and/or indicative spectral features .",
    "the possible companion masses can be seen in table  2 .",
    "four of the analysed systems have companion masses , which are compatible with either typical white dwarfs ( wd ) or late main - sequence stars ( late ms ) .",
    "the companion of wd0107@xmath90342 is a massive white dwarf .",
    "since the total mass of the binary may exceed the chandrasekhar limit , the system is a good candidate for a double degenerate sn ia progenitor with subdwarf primary , only the second one after kpd1930@xmath272752 @xcite .    the very similar he0929@xmath90424 and tons183 have to have quite massive companions .",
    "even in the less likely case that their sdb primaries are of low mass ( @xmath28 ) the companions would be heavy white dwarfs . at the most probable sdb mass , however , their companions would exceed the chandrasekhar mass limit .",
    "there are only two kinds of objects known with such high masses and such low luminosities  neutron stars and stellar mass black holes .",
    "the two systems he0532@xmath94503 and pg1232@xmath9136 have even higher companion masses , which would exceed the chandrasekhar limit for any mass of a core helium - burning subdwarf star ( see fig .",
    "[ t19:lock1 ] ) .",
    "the three long - period binaries he1448@xmath90510 , he2150@xmath90238 and wd0048@xmath9202 could not be solved with the described method .",
    "these systems can not be synchronized ( see sect . 5 ) .",
    "binaries hosting a neutron star or a black hole are a very rare class of objects . from about 50 analysed sdb binaries in our samples , we found two , possibly four candidate systems .",
    "this fraction of 48% is much too high to be compatible with any binary evolution model known so far ( podsiadlowski priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "our results depend strongly on the projected rotational velocity .",
    "the unexpectedly high masses could only be reduced if the @xmath29 were underestimated .",
    "as described above we quantified all possible systematic effects and the overall results were very consistent .",
    "but even if there would be unaccounted systematic effects ( e.g. short period pulsations ) , they would always cause extra broadening of the lines .",
    "the measured broadening is then due to rotation plus the unaccounted effects , which means the deduced rotational broadening would be overestimated .",
    "potential systematic effects yet unaccounted for would therefore lead to even higher companion masses .",
    "our method rests on the assumption of orbital synchronization . in fig .",
    "[ t19:vrotdistrib ] we compare the @xmath29-distribution of close sdb binaries to the distribution of the single stars .",
    "a large fraction of binary sdbs exceeds the maximum @xmath30 , derived for the single sdb stars , significantly .",
    "the most likely reason for this is tidal interaction with the companion .",
    "the question of which mechanisms are responsible for the synchronization of such stars is not yet settled .",
    "subluminous b stars have convective cores and radiative envelopes .",
    "the physical mechanisms for tidal dissipation in such stars are under debate .",
    "different theoretical concepts @xcite predict that the synchronization timescale @xmath31 depends strongly on the orbital period but differs in absolute values .",
    "tidal locking can only be assumed if the synchronization time scales are significantly lower than the average lifetime on the ehb of @xmath32 .",
    "using the formalism of @xcite @xmath31 would exceed t@xmath33 for periods longer than @xmath34 , whereas this would be the case at @xmath35 if we apply the theory of @xcite .",
    "but as long as the question of tidal synchronization is not settled , all timescales have to be taken with caution @xcite .",
    "detailed calculations , which take the internal structure of sdbs into account , are not available and urgently needed .",
    "observational constraints are necessary to guide the development of more sophisticated models .    up to",
    "now such observational constraints are rare .",
    "two short period ( @xmath36 ) sdb binaries with white - dwarf companions show light variations due to their ellipsoidal deformation @xcite and are therefore most likely synchronized .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of shallow ellipsoidal variations in the longer period ( @xmath37 ) sdb+wd binary pg0101@xmath27039 .",
    "@xcite verified that the light variations are due to ellipsoidal deformation and that tidal synchronization is very likely established for pg0101@xmath27039 ( see fig .",
    "[ t19:feige11 ] ) .",
    "we conclude that this assumption should hold for all sdb binaries with orbital periods of less than half a day .",
    "last but not least , van grootel et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) carried out an asteroseismological analysis of the pulsating sdb in the binary feige 48 ( sdb+wd , @xmath38 ) and found it to be synchronized .    in table  2",
    "we show which binaries fulfill the empirical or theoretical criteria for synchronization .",
    "it has to be pointed out that three of our candidate systems with massive compact companions are consistent with all of them .",
    "out of 12 analysed sdb binaries , five have companion masses compatible with white dwarfs of typical mass or late - type main - sequence stars .",
    "the properties of these systems are in full agreement with binary population - synthesis simulations .",
    "four binaries have surprisingly high companion masses , which leads to the conclusion , that the companions have to be white dwarfs of unusually high mass or even neutron stars or black holes . this high fraction can not be explained with current evolutionary calculations . as our analysis assumes synchronization , a better understanding of this process for sdb stars",
    "is urgently needed .",
    "a larger sample of sdb binaries has to be studied with our method to search for systematic trends and improve statistics .",
    "the presence of such a high fraction of heavy binaries in our samples raises several questions .",
    "is the formation and evolution of sdb stars linked to that of heavy compact objects like neutron stars or black holes ?",
    "can sdb stars be used as tracers to find more of these exotic objects ?",
