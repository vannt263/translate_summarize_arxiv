    "in the past few years , a generalization of the standard light - front dynamics ( lfd ) has been proposed : covariant light - front dynamics@xcite ( clfd ) .",
    "the formulation has already been succesfully applied to relativistic particle and nuclear physics and it is particularly useful for describing hadrons , and all observables related to them , within the constituent quark model . in clfd@xcite , the state vector which describes the physical bound state",
    "is defined on the light - front plane given by the equation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is an unspecified light - like four vector ( @xmath4 ) which defines the position of the light - front plane and @xmath5 is a four vector position of the system .",
    "clfd proposes a formulation in which the evolution for a given system is expressed in terms of covariant expressions .",
    "any four vector describing a phenomena can be transformed from one system of reference to another one by using a unique standard matrix which depends only on kinematical parameters and on @xmath3 .",
    "the particle is described by a wave function expressed in terms of fock components of the state vector which respects the properties required under any transformation .",
    "the state vector describing a meson of momentum @xmath6 , defined on a light - front plane characterized by @xmath3 , is given by : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the momentum of the quark @xmath10 .",
    "( [ eq7.8 ] ) @xmath11 is the projection of the total angular momentum , @xmath12 , of the system on the @xmath13 axis in the rest frame and @xmath14 are the spin projections of the particles 1 to 2 in the corresponding rest systems . from the delta function",
    "ensuring momentum conservation , one gets : @xmath15 to keep track of this conservation law , a momentum , @xmath16 , is assigned to the spurion but there is no fictitious particle in the physical state vector ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we emphasize that the bound state wave function is always an off - energy shell object ( @xmath17 due to binding energy ) and depends on the light - front orientation .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 is entirely determined by the on - mass shell condition for the individual constituents .",
    "the two - body wave function @xmath19 written in eq .",
    "( [ eq7.8 ] ) can be parametrized in terms of various sets of variables .",
    "we shall use in the following the usual light - front coordinates @xmath20 , which are defined by analogy to the equal time function in the infinite momentum frame as : @xmath21 and where @xmath22 is decomposed in its spatial components parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the light - front , @xmath23 .",
    "we have by definition @xmath24 , and thus @xmath25 .",
    "the explicit covariance of our approach allows us to write down the general structure of the two - body bound state . for a scalar particle composed of an antiquark and a quark of same mass , @xmath26",
    ", it has the form : @xmath27v(k_1)\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the usual antiparticle and particle dirac spinors , and @xmath30 is the scalar component of the meson wave function , @xmath31 .",
    "the expression for @xmath30 is as follows : @xmath32 where one defines @xmath33 the component @xmath34 will be parametrized by a gaussian wave function written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are parameters to be determined from experimental data and theoretical assumptions . in terms of the variables @xmath38",
    ", we have for the relative momentum between two quarks of same masses : @xmath39 where the relativistic , relative momentum , @xmath40 , corresponds , in the frame where @xmath41 , to the usual relative momentum between the two particles .",
    "in the covariant light - front dynamics formalism , the exact transition amplitude does not depend on the light front orientation .",
    "however , in any approximate computation the dependence is explicit and we can parametrize this dependence since our formalism is covariant . hence ,",
    "the approximate amplitude expressed in clfd is given by the following hadronic matrix , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a non - physical form factor which has to be zero in any exact calculation . the last term in eq .",
    "( 6 ) represents the explicit dependence of the amplitude on the light front orientation @xmath3 . in order to extract the physical form factor @xmath45 , without any dependence on @xmath3 , from the amplitude @xmath46",
    ", we will proceed as follow .",
    "first , we calculate the scalar products @xmath47 and @xmath48 which are defined by , @xmath49   \\\\ + f_{-}(q^{2 } ) ( m_{1}^2-m_{2}^2 )   + b(q^{2 } ) p_1 { \\!\\cdot\\!}\\omega   \\ ; ( 1 +   y ) \\ , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] -0.6 cm @xmath50 with the meson masses , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq9.8 ] ,  [ eq9.9 ] ,  [ eq9.10 ] ) the term @xmath53 defines the ratio between the two momenta @xmath54 and @xmath55 times the light - like four vector @xmath3 as , @xmath56 with @xmath57 for @xmath58 , it is convenient to restrict ourselves to the plane defined by @xmath59 .",
    "this condition is allowed in the system of reference where @xmath60 with @xmath61 . from the scalar products @xmath47 and @xmath62 we can isolate the form factors @xmath63 from @xmath44 .",

    "the leading contribution to the transition amplitude @xmath70 is given by the diagram shown in fig .",
    "2 .        by using the clfd rules",

    "( [ eq9.12 ] ) we are able to compute the form factors @xmath63 as a function of @xmath81 and this over the whole available momentum range @xmath82 .",
    "introducing another set of form factors @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the relationship between the two sets of form factors is @xmath85        note that at @xmath89 , one obtains @xmath90 .",
    "we calculated the transition form factors in the case of the pseudoscalar scalar transitions , such as @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the weak transitions mentioned previously are induced by a current quark transition , @xmath93 or @xmath94 according to which component of the @xmath95 one focuses on .",
    "we are working in a constituent quark model where the clfd formalism is applied .",
    "the wave functions used to describe the particles @xmath96 and @xmath95 have been determined using the same approach as that for the form factors and have been constrained by physical observable such as decay constant and the normalization as well@xcite . in our model of the scalar meson @xmath95 , one assumes it is made of components @xmath97 and @xmath98 with constraints from @xmath99 branching ratios .",
    "all the details regarding its phenomenological determination can be found in paper@xcite .",
    "the results are shown in figs .  3 and  4 where the form factors @xmath100 and",
    "@xmath86 are plotted as a function of the momentum transfer @xmath1 .",
    "note that the theory allows us to directly obtain the behaviour of the form factors for all values of @xmath81 without extrapolation . through the form factors @xmath101 ( that depend on the wave functions @xmath102 and @xmath95 ) , derived within the clfd formalism , the hadronic matrix elements that drives the weak decay transition between two hadronic states can be known more precisely .",
