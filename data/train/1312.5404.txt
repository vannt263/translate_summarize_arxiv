    "the character of  electrons in rare earth and actinide materials , i.e. itinerant vs localized , has been the subject of considerable research effort , yet a complete description is still missing .",
    "of particular interest is the case of plutonium , which bridges the itinerant behavior in lighter actinides where 5  electrons form fairly broad conduction bands and the localized , atomic - like 5  states in heavier actinides @xcite .",
    "this somewhat dual nature of pu s 5  states is linked to the variety of unusual properties displayed by elemental pu and its compounds , as manifested , for example , in the emergence of exotic magnetism and unconventional superconductivity .",

    "the qualitative difference of the 5  character in these compounds , along with the fact that  does not seem to be close to a magnetic instability @xcite , have put forward the possibility that superconductivity may not be mediated by af fluctuations in all members of this class of materials as suggested before @xcite .",
    "instead , it is plausible that the high sc transition temperature of  is associated with the proximity to a valence instability @xcite , while superconductivity in  is mediated by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations associated with a quantum critical point @xcite .",
