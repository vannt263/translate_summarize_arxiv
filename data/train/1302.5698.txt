    "the possibility to construct a generator of magnons on the basis of electron - magnon interaction has been discussed for nearly 50 years@xcite@xmath0@xcite .",
    "interest in this problem is associated with the possibility of designing a submillimeter - range laser possessing unique characteristics which would emit at a frequency controllable by the magnetic field .",
    "the idea that a beam of fast electrons can excite spin waves ( sw ) in magnetically - ordered crystals was first suggested in ref . .",
    "there an assumption was made that excitation of sw occurs as a result of relativistic interaction of the beam with the spins of magnetic atoms .",
    "since this interaction has the value @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the beam velocity , @xmath3 is the speed of light , then the effect may be realized at the velocities close to the speed of light . in subsequent papers , in order to enhance the interaction of electrons with the magnetic moments of the atoms , an idea was put forward to realize this effect in magnetic semiconductors where the concentrations of charge carriers is several orders of magnitude larger than the concentration which can be realized in an electron beam in vacuum .",
    "however , practical attempts to realize generation of sw with the use of semiconductor plasma of ferromagnetic semiconductors have failed ( results of some of them are presented in ref .   and in more recent publications@xcite@xmath0@xcite ) .",
    "as was shown in ref .",
    "we get qualitatively new possibilities for creation of a magnon generator if we use not ferro- , but antiferromagnetic ( af ) semiconductors . in this case generation of magnons",
    "is possible due to a strong s - f(d ) exchange interaction not involving a relativistic factor . in refs .",
    "it was assumed that spin waves are amplified by charge carriers in delocalized states of band type . here",
    "the main problem hindering the effect realization is associated with the necessity to get a drift velocity of current carriers higher than the phase velocity of sw @xmath4 . however , in overwhelming majority of antiferromagnetics , the current carriers have low velocity and very strong electric fields are needed to speed them up so that their velocity should exceed @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    "we suggest a qualitatively different principle of magnon generation by current carriers . it can be realized when charge carriers are in localized spinpolaron states . in this case",
    "the generation takes place with the use of s - f(d ) exchange interaction which does not require that the current carriers should obey the condition @xmath5 .",
    "the states of small - radius spinpolaron type occur in narrow - band antiferromagnetic semiconductors : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the band width , @xmath8 is s - f(d ) exchange integral , @xmath9 is the spin of a magnetic atom.@xcite their effective mass is several orders of magnitude exceeds that of a free electron and therefore they are slightly mobile if at all .",
    "the drift velocity of such charge carriers will be small in an electric field , therefore their contribution into generation of magnons will be small too .",
    "for this reason it will be interesting to consider another type of spinpolarons , i.e. large - radius ones which occur in wide - band antiferromagnetics . as is shown in ref .",
    ", in the absence of an external magnetic field , charge carriers can be self - localized only in antiferromagnetics with extremely low neel temperatures . in ref .",
    "such spinpolaron formations were termed ferron states .",
    "ferron states , similarly to spinpolaron states in narrow - band antiferromagnetics are slightly mobile , therefore their drift velocity can not be large . in rather a strong external magnetic field , which however , does not exceed the value of collapse field , ferron states disappear . as was shown in ref .  , quite a different situation is observed in antiferromagnetics with high neel temperatures .",
    "most antiferromagnetics are high - temperature with sublattices collapse field @xmath10 oe and self - localized ferron states can not form there . if , however , such an antiferromagnetic is placed in a quantizing magnetic field , sinpolaron states become energetically more advantageous.@xcite being large - radius states , they can move in an electric field . as will be shown below , motion of such spinpolarons leads to emission of magnons and can be used for constructing a magnon generator .",
    "in the general form , the hamiltonian describing the motion of a conductivity electron in an anisotropic antiferromagnetic placed in an electric field looks like:@xcite    @xmath11    where @xmath12 describes the electron motion in a magnetic field with the vector potential @xmath13 , @xmath14 is responsible for the interaction between the conductivity electron and the magnetic subsystem of the crystal with the exchange constant s - f ( d ) which hereafter we will put equal to @xmath15 , @xmath16 is an exchange hamiltonian of an anisotropic antiferromagnetic af placed in a magnetic field @xmath17 ( @xmath17 is given in energy units ) . for a single axis antiferromagnetic",
    "whose anisotropy axis lies along @xmath18-axis , exchange integrals have the form :    @xmath19    restricting our consideration to the case when interaction takes place only between two equivalent sublattices , we introduce the notation :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the number of magnet atoms in the sublattice .",
    "let us consider the case when the external magnetic field @xmath22 is directed along the axis @xmath23 , that is perpendicular to the anisotropy axis . in this case over the whole interval of @xmath17 variation ,",
    "the vector of the antiferromagnetic magnetization is directed along the field @xmath24 . in the spin - wave approximation ,",
    "spin operators are replaced by the bose operators of the birth and annihilation of spin deviations and in their own coordinate system ( associated with the direction of the magnetic atom spin ) are given by :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 . believing the electron spin to be fully polarized , i.e. having put @xmath27 and taking into account short - range character of the s -f exchange interaction @xmath28",
