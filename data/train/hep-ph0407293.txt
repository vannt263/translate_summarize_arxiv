    "standard model contributions to @xmath0-@xmath3 mixing and _ cp _ violation in charm decays are greatly suppressed compared to similar contributions in the strange and bottom sectors .",
    "investigations of the k and b systems have and will continue to play a central role in our quest to understand flavor physics , but investigations of the charm - quark sector are fundamental too . since charm is the only _ up - type",
    "_ quark for which the decay modes can be studied , it has a unique role to investigate flavor physics .",
    "charm allows a complementary probe of standard model beyond to that attainable from the _ down - type _ sector .",
    "it is indeed this suppression that makes searching for charm mixing and _ cp _ violation interesting : it provides opportunities to search for new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "mixing occurs because the two weak eigenstates @xmath0 and @xmath1 are not the mass eigenstates . if _",
    "cp _ is conserved , @xmath4 are mass and _ cp _ eigenstates with @xmath5 and @xmath6 different from 0 . experimental limits on @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing indicate that @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is then usual to define :    @xmath9    in the case of _ cp _ conservation ( and if @xmath10 ) the amplitude for @xmath0 to mix into @xmath1 assumes a very simple expression :    @xmath11    to compute the transition rate , one has to take into account other processes that can interfere with mixing . in the case of",
    "the @xmath0 hadronic decays , the transition @xmath12 is fed both by mixing and doubly cabibbo suppressed decay(dcsd ) :    @xmath13    @xmath14 e^{-\\gamma t } \\label{equaws}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is the strong phase shift due to final state interactions ( fsi ) between the dcsd ( @xmath16 ) and the cabibbo favored mode(@xmath17 ) , and @xmath18 is their relative branching ratio .",
    "the net effect of @xmath15 is to rotate the definition of @xmath19 and @xmath20 by the same angle , that is @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "in contrast with @xmath0 hadronic decays , in the @xmath0 semileptonic decays the dcsd terms are absents and the entire mixing rate is proportional to the square of @xmath19 and @xmath20 multiplied by @xmath23 .    a wide range ( roughly 7 orders of magnitude ) of standard model and non - standard model predictions appear in literature@xcite .",
    "most of these theoretical predictions are well below the one percent level for both @xmath19 and @xmath20 . very recently",
    ", however , a theoretical prediction has been published@xcite that shows it is possible for the standard model mixing mechanisms to generate @xmath19 and @xmath20 values of about one percent , complicating searches for new physics .",
    "a well known method to measure mixing parameters is to form the ratio of the number of wrong sign ( ws ) decays @xmath24 to the right sign ( rs ) @xmath25 to measure directly @xmath26 ( throughout this paper the charge conjugate state is implied , unless otherwise noted ) .",
    "the limiting factor for this method is the background under the ws signal",
    ".    another possibility would be to measure directly @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "the measurement of @xmath19 is not feasible since it would require a mass resolution of about 25 @xmath27ev in the most favorable case ( assuming the mixing entirely due to @xmath19 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the measurement of @xmath20 turns out to be one of the best experimental probes of charm mixing .",
    "experimentally instead of @xmath28 one measures @xmath29 which , in the limit of _ cp_-symmetry(see section on _ cp _ violation for present limits ) , equals @xmath28 .",
    "the easiest way to measure @xmath29 is by comparing the lifetimes of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "in fact , assuming that the @xmath32 final state is an equal mixture of _ cp_-even and _ cp_-odd states , one finds that :    @xmath33    the last method is based on the measurement of the interference term between the mixing and dcsd amplitudes ( see equation  [ equaws ] ) : @xmath34 .",
    "information on mixing is massively improving due to the advent of new very high statistics data from babar and belle , both through the study of the interference of mixing with dcsd and lifetime differences .",
    "the current best determination of @xmath35 is @xmath36@xcite and it will be very interesting to see if mixing does occur at the percent level .",
    "there is an excellent review of this subject ( and of _ cp _ violation and rare decays too ) by burdman and shipsey@xcite and i suggest the interested reader to look at this review for more details .",
    "_ cp _ violation occurs if the decay rate for a particle differs from the decay rate of its",
    "_ cp_-conjugate particle@xcite .",
    "_ cp _ violation , which in the standard model ( sm ) is a consequence of a complex amplitude in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , has been observed in @xmath37 and @xmath38 decays . in charm",
    "meson decays ( as well as in @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) two classes of _ cp _ violation exist : indirect and direct . in the case of direct violation ,",
    "_ cp _ violating effects occur in a decay process only if the decay amplitude is the sum of two different parts@xcite , whose phases are made of a weak ( ckm ) and a strong contribution due to fsi : @xmath39 .",
    "the weak contributions to the phases change sign when going to the _ cp_-conjugate process , while the strong ones do not . therefore _",
    "cp _ violating asymmetry will be :    @xmath40    in singly cabibbo - suppressed @xmath41 decays , penguin terms in the effective hamiltonian may provide the different phases of the two weak amplitudes .",
    "compared to the strange and bottom sectors , the sm predictions of _ cp _ violation for charm decays are much smaller @xcite , making the charm sector a good place to test the sm and to look for evidence of new physics . in the sm , direct _",
    "cp _ violating asymmetries in @xmath41 decays are predicted to be largest in singly cabibbo - suppressed decays , at most @xmath42 , and non - existent in cabibbo - favored and doubly cabibbo - suppressed decays .",
    "however , a _",
    "asymmetry could occur in the decay modes @xmath43 due to interference between cabibbo - favored and doubly cabibbo - suppressed decays@xcite .    before searching for a _ cp _",
    "asymmetry one must account for differences , at the production level , between @xmath41 and @xmath44 in photoproduction and hadroproduction fixed target experiments(the hadronization process , in the presence of remnant quarks from the nucleon , gives rise to production asymmetries ) .",
    "this is done usually by normalizing to the cabibbo - favored modes , with the additional benefit that most of the corrections due to inefficiencies cancel out , reducing systematic uncertainties .",
    "an implicit assumption is that there is no measurable _ cp _ violation in the cabibbo - favored decays .",
    "the _ cp _ asymmetry parameter measures the direct _ cp _ asymmetry in the case of @xmath45 and the combined direct and indirect _",

    ".__cp _ asymmetry measurements . _ [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ cptable ]    table [ cptable ] summarizes the current standing of the _ cp _ asymmetry measurements . from this summary",
    "i can draw some conclusions :    * the @xmath46% level have been reached for some decay modes , that is still an order of magnitude bigger than the theoretical expected values , but represents a substantial improvement * the measured _ cp _ asymmetries are all consistent with zero within the errors * there is no evidence of _ cp _ violation in the charm sector    in my opinion , however , with large data sample of reconstructed charm particles it will be possible to study _ cp _ violation ( or better _ t _ violation ) using the _ t_-odd correlation obtained by a triple product .",
    "this type of measurement in the charm sector was suggested by bigi sometime ago@xcite .",
    "for example , consider the decay mode @xmath47 where one can form a _",
    "t_-odd correlation with the momenta :    @xmath48    under time reversal @xmath49 hence the name _ t_-odd .",
    "since time reversal is implemented by an anti - unitary operator , @xmath50 can be induced by fsi .",
    "so @xmath50 does not establish _",
    "violation because fsi can act as an impostor here .",
    "this ambiguity can be resolved by computing @xmath51 from @xmath52 :    @xmath53    finding @xmath54 establishes _ cp _ violation without further troubles .",
    "focus tried to make this measurement but the statistics was low and found no evidence for _ t _ violation .",
    "my advice to present and future experiments is to pursue this type of search .",
    "it is indeed a clean way to search for _ cp _ violation .    another interesting way to search for _ cp _ violation is by means of the dalitz plot analysis , this will be discussed in the hadronic decay section .",
    "one interesting way to search for physics beyond the standard model is to look at decay modes that are extremely _ rare _ or _ forbidden _ in the charm sector . in the charm sector",
    "the rare and forbidden decay modes can be split mainly into three categories :    * flavor changing neutral current(fcnc ) such as @xmath55 and + @xmath56 * lepton family number violating(lfnv ) such as @xmath57 * lepton number violating(lnv ) such as @xmath58    where @xmath59 stands for @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "the first decay modes(fcnc ) are _ rare _ , where rare decays usually means a process which proceeds via an internal quark loop in the standard model ( forbidden at the tree level ) ; i.e. can not proceed via a single charged current w - exchange@xcite .",
    "the other two decay modes(lfnv and lnv ) are strictly _ forbidden _ in the standard model .    the fcnc decay mode @xmath55 can proceed via a w box diagram , also contributing to the @xmath63 mixing .",
    "however it is expected to be helicity suppressed by a factor @xmath64 and current estimates@xcite for the branching fractions are of the order of @xmath65 .",
    "although long - distance effects are predicted to enhance these rates by several orders of magnitude , these expected rates are out of the sensitivity of the present and near future experiments .",
    "this is the reason why these decays modes are so attractive : any detection , in fact , will be a clear sign of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the predictions for the other fcnc decay modes , @xmath56 , are considerably larger .",
    "these decay modes can proceed via several penguin diagrams@xcite , but the 3-body decays do not suffer from helicity suppression .",
    "the branching fraction estimates for these modes are of the order of @xmath66 .",
    "in addition to these short distance diagrams there are contributions from long distance effects , such as photon pole amplitude or resonance decays can be obtained via the decay chain @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "this mode has a composite branching fraction of @xmath69 , three order of magnitude bigger than the corresponding non - resonant decay mode.however this contribution can be handle properly excluding the kinematic regions of the muon couple corresponding to the @xmath70 mass ] , which can be much larger .",
    "the difficulty in the calculation of the long distance contributions is linked to the hadronic uncertainties@xcite .",
    "the estimates for these contributions are around @xmath71 ; in all cases the long distance contributions overwhelm those from the standard model short distance physics .",
    "the lfnv and lnv decay modes test the conservation of the lepton family and of the lepton number .",
    "there is no reason why the lepton number should be conserved , that is no fundamental principle analogous to the gauge invariance exists@xcite .",
    "therefore lepton number conservation could break down , but the question is at what energy scale ?",
    "for example one can consider the decay mode @xmath72 where the particle h , supposed to mediate this interaction , contains the quantum number of quarks and leptons .",
    "it is thus referred as _",
    "considering the standard model analogous process @xmath73 ( mediated by the @xmath74 ) and assuming the same coupling constant one can calculate that for an experimental sensitivity of @xmath75 the non - observation of this mode implies a mass for the h particle greater than @xmath76 , or in other words one is probing the @xmath76 mass scale .",
    "recently cdf published an upper limit for the decay @xmath77@xcite improving by a factor 2 the previous pdg 2002  @xcite limit . the search for new physic effects in charm rare decays is going on ; the gap between the theoretical predictions and the experimental upper limits is still large , even if it is reducing in the recent years .",
    "there is already an upper limit ( @xmath78 ) that tends to exclude a prediction of the minimal supersymmetric standard model@xcite .",
    "the determination of lifetimes allows to convert the branching ratios measured by experiments to partial decay rates predicted by theory .",
    "focus is the only experiment ( with the predecessor experiment e687 ) to have measured the lifetimes of all the weakly decaying charmed particles .",
    "this is particularly important when one forms the ratio of lifetimes because most of the systematic errors cancel out .",
    "fig  [ fig : lifetime ] shows a comparison between the pdg 2002  @xcite values and the focus lifetime measurements .",
    "focus produced new lifetimes results with precision better than the previous world average .",
    "an accurate measurement of the @xmath0 lifetime for the golden decay mode into @xmath79 is a crucial ingredient to determine the lifetime difference , and consequently the parameter @xmath20 of the @xmath63 mixing .    to    the increasingly precise measurements of the heavy quark lifetimes have stimulated the further development of theoretical models , like the heavy quark theory  @xcite , which are able to predict successfully the rich pattern of charm hadron lifetimes , that span one order of magnitude from the longest lived @xmath45 to the",
    "shortest lived @xmath80 . for the charm mesons",
    "a clear lifetime pattern emerges in agreement with the theoretical predictions : @xmath81 .",
    "even the expectations  @xcite for the charm baryon lifetimes reproduce the data , which is quite remarkable since , in addition to the exchange diagram , there are constructive as well as destructive contributions to the decay rate .",
    "the experimental results lead to the following baryon lifetime hierarchy : @xmath82 .",
    "the semileptonic decays of heavy flavored particles can be calculated from first principles .",
    "involving a lepton in the final decay stage implies that one does not have to worry about the usual final state interaction between hadrons .",
    "the possible complications coming from qcd corrections of the decay process are contained in form factors .",
    "the form factors can be calculated by various models : hqet , lattice gauge theories and quark models .",
    "the angular distributions and invariant masses among the decay products would determine the form factors ratios while the branching ratio measurements and information from the ckm matrix would give the absolute scale for the form factors .",
    "charm semileptonic decay provide a high quality lattice calibration crucial to reduce future systematic error in the unitarity triangle .",
    "the same techniques validated in charm can be applied to beauty .",
    "there are recent results from cleo@xcite on the decays @xmath83 both for the cabibbo favored @xmath84 and for the cabibbo suppressed @xmath85 .",
    "these measurements turned out in a big advance in precision for the two branching ratios measurements .",
    "for the last 20 years people regarded the @xmath86 decays ( that is @xmath87 ) as 100% @xmath88 events .",
    "this situation changed when focus started to analyze @xmath86 decays to get form factors . during this form factor analysis@xcite ,",
    "focus checked the angular distribution of kaon in the @xmath89 rest frame ( @xmath90 and found that it showed a huge forward - backward asymmetry below the @xmath91 pole mass while almost no asymmetry above the pole .",
    "since the @xmath92 is a p - wave , pure @xmath93 decays would have shown only a symmetric forward - backward @xmath94 distribution over the entire @xmath89 invariant mass range .",
    "this suggests a possible quantum mechanics interference effect .",
    "a simple approach to emulate the interference effect is adding a spin zero amplitude in the matrix elements of the @xmath86 decays .",
    "focus tried a constant amplitude with a phase , @xmath95 , in the place where the @xmath92 couples to the spin zero component of the @xmath74 particle .",
    "focus determined that the pure @xmath96 events are 94.5% of the selected events and therefore the br has to be modified accordingly .",
    "focus measured also the relative branching ratio between @xmath97 and @xmath98 decays .",
    "this measurement is comparable with all the other measurements in this channel and there is no evidence for s - wave interference in @xmath97 .    for what concerns the @xmath99 form factors",
    ", the vector and axial form factors are generally parametrized by a pole dominance form , and the experiments usually measures @xmath100 and @xmath101 . for the decay mode",
    "@xmath96 the experimental results are getting very precise and more theoretical calculations are needed .",
    "theoretically the @xmath97 form factors should be within 10% of @xmath96 .",
    "the measured @xmath102 values were consistent , but @xmath103 was a factor 2 higher . anyway",
    "the very recent focus measurement@xcite has consistent @xmath103 value as well .",
    "i want to conclude this section with a question : will there be similar effects ( interference ) in other charm ( or beauty ) semileptonic channels ?",
    "we will see , in the meanwhile the analyses of other semileptonic charm decay modes are actively going on and we expect new results soon .",
    "if we have found complications in the simpler semileptonic decays , one can easily imagine that the hadronic decays are much more complicated .",
    "it turned out that fsi play a central role in the hadronic decays .",
    "for example , the focus recent analysis@xcite of the branching ratio @xmath104 ( known as a long standing puzzle of charm decays ) confirm that fsi are fundamental .",
    "actually an isospin analysis of the channels @xmath105 and @xmath106 reveals that the elastic fsi can not account for all the large deviation from unity of this ratio(@xmath107 ) .",
    "the most reasonable explanation seems to be the inelastic fsi that also allow for the transition @xmath108 .    for the multi - body modes , where resonances are present , the amplitude analysis ( dalitz plot analysis ) is the correct way to determine the resonant substructure of the decays .    what does one learn from dalitz plot analysis",
    "bands indicate resonance contribution . for spinless parents , like @xmath45 or @xmath109 , the number of nodes in the bands give the resonance spin .",
    "interference pattern gives relative phases and amplitudes@xcite , so one has access to a complete set of information not only the branching ratio !",
    "but there is a complication for charm dalitz plot analysis : one needs to face the problem of dealing with light scalar particles populating charm meson hadronic decays , such as @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "this requires the understanding of light - quark hadronic physics , including the riddle of @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( that is @xmath114 and @xmath79 states produced close to threshold ) whose existence is still controversial .",
    "let me consider the decay @xmath115 , the problem is to write the propagator for the resonance r. for a well - defined wave with specific isospin and spin ( ij ) characterized by narrow and well - isolated resonances , the propagator can be approximated by a single breit - wigner . in the so - called isobar model",
    "the dalitz plot amplitude is given by the following sum :    @xmath116    where the first term is for the non - resonant component and in the sum the index j runs over the resonances .",
    "the fit parameters are @xmath117 and @xmath118 , and @xmath119 is @xmath120 ( see @xcite for more details ) . nearly all charm dalitz plot analysis use the isobar model .",
    "in contrast , when the specific ij - wave is characterized by large and heavily overlapping resonances ( just as the scalars ) , to write the propagator is not so simple . indeed , it is very easy to realize that the propagation is no longer dominated by a single resonance but it is the result of a complicated interplay among resonances . in this case , it can be demonstrated on very general ground that the propagator may be written in the context of the k - matrix approach@xcite as @xmath121 , where @xmath37 is the matrix for the scattering of particles @xmath46 and @xmath122 , that is to write down the propagator one needs the scattering matrix .    what is the problem with the isobar model ?",
    "the problem is that the sum of two ( or more ) breit - wigner for broad and overlapping resonances does not respect unitary .",
    "moreover the representation in the argand plot shows that the phase is not properly evaluated . on the contrary adding two k matrices respects unitary and has the correct behavior in the argand plot .",
    "very recently focus published a pioneer work@xcite using , for the first time in the analyses of charm decays ( applied to the decay modes @xmath123 ) , the formalism of k - matrix .",
    "the focus amplitude was written as a sum :    @xmath124    where the first term is the usual non - resonant term , the second term ( f ) models the s - wave ( the scalars ) , and the last term is an isobar breit - wigner sum for higher spin resonances .",
    "focus obtains reasonable fits with no re - tuning of the k - matrix parameters@xcite ( this was not obvious at the beginning of the analysis ) and no need to invoke new resonances ( such as @xmath125 ) .    with dalitz plot analysis",
    "we have a new tool to search for _ cp _ violation because one gets amplitude coefficients and phases .",
    "there are two recent results of this type of search .",
    "the first one is from the dalitz plot analysis of the decay mode @xmath126 by cleo@xcite .",
    "they used a smart way to represent the cp violating parameters .",
    "they showed upper limits and computed also an integrated ( over the dalitz ) asymmetry .",
    "the second result was shown by focus in 2002@xcite .",
    "focus presented a dalitz plot analysis of the csd @xmath127 , determining the phases and the amplitude coefficients separately for @xmath45 and @xmath128 .",
    "the fact that this analysis did not produce a paper should be clear from the previous discussion : a k - matrix analysis is necessary to handle properly the scalar resonances present in this final state .",
    "the intention of focus is to revisit this analysis and publish soon a paper .",
    "it was one of the hot topic of the year 2003 .",
    "i want just briefly to remind that in spring 2003 babar discovered@xcite a new particle @xmath129 which decays in @xmath130 violating isospin .",
    "this discovery was later confirmed by cleo and belle .",
    "then a second state @xmath131 was found by cleo@xcite which decays in @xmath132 , and later confirmed by babar and belle .",
    "strange property of these states is their surprisingly low mass compared to the potential model expectations .",
    "their mass are practically equal to those of similar states in @xmath133 system : @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the @xmath136 of @xmath129 seems to be @xmath137 , this is suggested by the low mass , absence of the decay @xmath138 and absence of the decay @xmath139 . for what concerns @xmath131 it seems to have unnatural spin - parity @xmath140 , as suggested by the analysis of belle@xcite .",
    "in addition the widths of these two states ( @xmath141 ) are consistent with the experimental resolution .",
    "looking at the spectroscopy of the @xmath142 states one can conclude that the new states do not fit well : mass below the @xmath143 $ ] threshold .",
    "if interpreted as ordinary @xmath142 states , they decay mainly by isospin - violating @xmath144 emission thus having widths quite narrow .",
    "a possible decay mechanism could be through a virtual @xmath145 followed by @xmath146 mixing .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath147 as predicted by models based on hqet and chiral symmetry@xcite . a lot of interested by theorists : more than 40 papers have been already published .",
    "at 30 years from the discovery of the _ c _ quark the physics analyses of the first heavy quark have reached a complete maturity . with the large statistics now available in the charm sector we start to see unexpected effects which complicate the interpretation of the decay processes , both in semileptonic and hadronic decays . for sure we know that fsi play a crucial role and that the physics of the light hadrons is important for the correct interpretation of the charm decays .",
    "this means lessons for the @xmath38 decays ?",
    "i think yes .      finally let me remind the players in this sector . while e791 and focus are finishing their analysis , the present and the near future are dominated by the results of babar , belle , cleo - c and unexpectedly cdf . in the long range",

    "<S> i was forced to make a selection of topics . </S>",
    "<S> i am going to discuss with the eyes of an experimentalist : @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing , _ cp _ violation , rare decays , charm lifetimes , semileptonic decays , hadronic decays , and the big surprise of the @xmath2 states . </S>",
