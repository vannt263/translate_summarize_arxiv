    "immiscible fluids and non - porous solids occur abundantly in both nature and industry .",
    "the location at which two such fluids and a solid meet is termed a contact line , and the modelling of moving contact lines is consequently of central importance to the understanding of problems as diverse as how insects walk on water and the wetting properties of plant leaves to coating , inkjet printing , and oil recovery  for reviews , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the main focus of this work is to compare a number of prevalent models proposed to resolve the _ moving contact line problem _ in the prototype system of quasistatic spreading of a thin two - dimensional droplet on a planar substrate .",
    "two early papers sparked interest in the moving contact line problem .",
    "the first by moffatt in 1964 @xcite considered the conceptually simple problem of a wedge of viscous fluid in contact with an inviscid fluid ( the interface kept flat ostensibly by the action of gravity ) , and also in contact with a solid substate moving with a constant velocity @xmath0 .",
    "in this situation , moffatt noted that in the absence of fluid inertia , a fluid particle initially on the fluid interface will be moving towards the contact line at a speed independent of the distance away from it , and with a value less that @xmath0 .",
    "the no - slip boundary condition will then enforce the speed of this fluid particle to instantaneously increase to @xmath0 at the contact line , where it ` turns the corner ' .",
    "this would require an infinite acceleration caused by an infinite stress and pressure at the contact line , all of which are physically unacceptable .",
    "this relatively brief glimpse into the moving contact line problem was brought into focus by the seminal work in 1971 of huh and scriven @xcite .",
    "the authors extended the analysis of moffatt to include the situation of two immiscible viscous fluids of arbitrary viscosities and described in detail the _ nonintegrable shear - stress singularity _ alongside offering suggestions as to how it may be overcome .",
    "huh and scriven highlighted the primary cause for the unphysical singularities as the no - slip condition at the wall . to resolve the moving contact line problem ,",
    "huh and scriven suggested that some form of slip in the contact line vicinity could be allowed , such as the navier - slip condition initially proposed in the far earlier work by navier @xcite . whilst this slip boundary condition was not initially proposed with a physical basis",
    ", it should be noted that in the last few decades there is evidence that slip can physically occur at the molecular scale , such as seen in the molecular dynamics simulations of @xcite , and there are numerous physical effects such as viscous heating , dissolved gas or polymer solutions , and surface roughness that may contribute to apparent slip @xcite .    since these important works , including the work of dussan v. and davis  @xcite who in 1974 clarified the moving contact line problem mathematically and with experiments , the volume of literature on the moving contact line problem has increased rapidly , as evidenced in the subsequent review articles  @xcite .",
    "the problem remains an active field of research , due in part to the wide variety of microscale physical effects which can resolve the problem .",
    "further to the above , these include modelling a precursor film ahead of the contact line ( physically realised through the inclusion of a disjoining pressure , which accounts for intermolecular interactions near the contact line )  @xcite ; rheological ( i.e.  non - newtonian ) effects  @xcite ; treating surfaces as separate thermodynamic entities with dynamic surface tensions ( as in the interface formation model )  @xcite ; introducing numerical slip  @xcite ; assuming the contact angle to be always @xmath1 at the solid substrate  @xcite , including evaporative fluxes  @xcite ; considering the interface to be diffuse  @xcite  with different models for liquid - gas  @xcite and liquid - liquid ( binary ) fluids  @xcite being adopted ; and modelling both molecular and hydrodynamic effects in hybrid models  @xcite .    in the present communication",
    "we will compare a variety of models that are used to alleviate the non - integrable stress singularity at a moving contact line , concentrating primarily on slip and precursor film models ( including one derived from diffuse - interface theory ) as well as the aforementioned interface formation model . in slip models",
    ", the no - slip boundary condition is relaxed to allow for fluid particles to move along the substrate . on the other hand ,",
    "the no - slip condition is applied on the substrate for precursor film models , but has only an apparent contact line away from the substrate , thus removing the associated stress and pressure singularities that would have occurred had the contact line been sharp . as the substrate must be entirely covered by a film in these models a disjoining pressure",
    "is included due to long - range intermolecular interactions ( such as from van der waals forces @xcite ) , with both repulsive and attractive contributions to this pressure balancing to create a stable thin - film .",
    "details of the interface formation model will be given in sec .",
    "[ sec : thinfilm ] where it is analysed .    alongside the question of which microscale effects to include in a description of the moving contact line",
    ", for many models there is another related question as to which additional boundary condition(s ) at the contact line should be imposed . for slip models , the boundary condition at the contact line usually takes the form of a prescription of the variation of contact angle with contact line velocity .",
    "a simple , yet widely used condition is that the microscopic contact angle remains at its static value when the contact line is in motion , i.e.  @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the microscopic contact angle in any situation , @xmath4 is the dynamic contact angle , and @xmath5 is the static contact angle .",
    "this is imposed in a number of studies involving slip models such as studies by hocking @xcite and cox @xcite , as well as a recent analysis providing model comparisons for 2d droplet spreading by savva and kalliadasis @xcite .",
    "the analysis of other contact angle conditions and models to extend the work of @xcite , given in sec .",
    "[ sec : thinfilm ] here , is the primary focus of this article .",
    "two forms we consider here to allow for contact line velocity dependence on microscopic contact angle are @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a coefficient with dimensions of velocity , and @xmath8 is a dimensionless exponent . the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 could be determined from experiments ( see , for instance , @xcite for some experimental measurements ) but the question as to whether the contact angle varies dynamically _ at _ the substrate remains an open debate , given the limits of experimental resolution ",
    "see discussion relating to this in @xcite .",
    "forms such as ( [ eq : introcarel ] ) are considered , with @xmath8 specified , for instance by greenspan @xcite , haley and miksis @xcite , hocking @xcite , ehrhard and davis @xcite , and wilson _ et al . _",
    "@xcite .    for the disjoining pressure models considered here , where there is an apparent contact line due to a precursor film , a different contact angle relation may be derived . for long - wave models ( where @xmath9 ) the contact angle is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the height of the free surface",
    ", @xmath12 is the precursor film thickness , @xmath13 is the fluid - fluid surface tension , @xmath14 is the interface potential for a flat film of thickness @xmath11 , and @xmath15 is the disjoining pressure , which here depends on the thin - film height .",
    "this long - wave equilibrium contact angle relation ( [ eq : earlyangledp ] ) is derived through multiple integrations of the equilibrium thin - film equation for precursor film / disjoining pressure models ( e.g.  by eggers @xcite ) , and is also used in the comparison study @xcite .",
    "we note that ( [ eq : earlyangledp ] ) is not an imposed boundary condition , since the effect of the disjoining pressure creates a precursor film and prevents an actual contact line occurring .",
    "the required boundary conditions are instead given by @xmath11 approaching the precursor film thickness @xmath12 at distances far from the bulk liquid region .    before discussing these models and conditions in the thin - film ( long - wave ) approximation in sec .",
    "[ sec : thinfilm ] , we revisit the early work of moffatt @xcite , which imposed no - slip , in sec .",
    "[ sec : mofhuhscriv ] to uncover the nature of the moving contact line singularity .",
    "we then extend the analysis to see how slip models overcome the problem in this simple situation , and to show that no essential physics is missing in the thin - film setting .",
    "the results will be in agreement with the later thin - film analysis of sec .",
    "[ sec : thinfilm ] .",
    "whilst the problems considered by moffatt @xcite and huh and scriven @xcite are unphysical  as in the imposed geometry the normal stress balance condition at the fluid - fluid free surface is not satisfied , it is instructive to revisit the situation and consider how slip conditions change the analysis .    consider the motion of a contact line on a perfectly flat solid surface , with governing equations appropriately nondimensionalised .",
    "it is convenient to work in a frame of reference where the contact line is fixed and the surface translates with steady ( nondimensional ) velocity @xmath16 .",
    "the contact line is the location where the fluid free surface meets the solid , the free surface is assumed to be planar at an angle @xmath17 .",

    "however , we will consider inertialess flow relevant for slow processes such as droplet spreading . in the moffatt wedge flow geometry , this means we consider the creeping ( or stokes , @xcite ) flow regime , where the nondimensional governing equations for inertialess incompressible newtonian flow are @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the fluid velocity , @xmath20 is the extra stress tensor , @xmath21 is the pressure , and @xmath22 is the stream function in polar coordinates . consider the behaviour as @xmath23 of @xmath24 , with @xmath25 an exponent to be determined . from this behaviour",
    "we can determine the order - of - magnitude estimates @xmath26 so that the pressure order - of - magnitude is @xmath27    the momentum equation is easily reduced to the biharmonic equation @xmath28 , after introducing the stream function , and we note the form of the pressure and stresses in polar coordinates , using ( [ eq : genewtonian ] ) , may be found from @xmath29    following moffatt @xcite , we take a separable stream function @xmath30 we note here that the power - law form ( [ eq : newton : psib ] ) for the stream function is used , as in @xcite who looked at other more complex forms of slip .",
    "this is in contrast to the analysis of hocking @xcite for navier - slip , who considered a form consisting of the no - slip solution modified by a logarithm . hocking s analysis gives a full matched asymptotic solution , which yields complex integral expressions that do not afford easy insight into the nature of the stress and pressure behaviours .",
    "we instead focus our simple analysis on the behaviour at the contact line , essentially the limit as the contact line is approached from the hocking inner solution  which becomes @xmath31 for the navier - slip model , as seen from equations ( 2.10 ) , ( 2.11 ) and ( 2.15 ) there .",
    "returning to ( [ eq : newton : psib ] ) , on substituting this into the biharmonic equation we obtain the linear ordinary differential equation ( ode ) for @xmath32 of @xmath33 true for all @xmath25 , including ( in particular ) @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",

    "the boundary conditions we apply in this ( artificial planar wedge ) configuration are of vanishing normal component of velocity at the solid surface and the fluid interface @xmath38 and the continuity of tangential stress at the interface @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the ( dimensionless ) surface tension , @xmath41 is the unit normal pointing out of the fluid , and @xmath42 , is a tangent vector on the interface .",
    "the surface tension in the classical model is usually assumed to be a constant unless temperature variation or variable chemical composition are to be modelled . in this section",
    "we will also assume constant surface tension , so that the boundary condition becomes @xmath43 but will return to discuss this assumption in appendix  [ app : wedge ] .",
    "the final condition is applied on the wall , where the various slip models may be introduced . in classical fluid mechanics problems ,",
    "no - slip is imposed on an interface between a viscous fluid and a solid boundary . for a moving contact line , this leads to a singular stress and pressure at the contact line , as discussed .",
    "navier - slip , discussed in the introduction , has been used extensively , and is of the form @xmath44 . in this representation",
    "the variables are nondimensional , with @xmath45 the wall velocity and @xmath46 the nondimensional slip - length .",
    "the possibilities for slip to overcome this problem we will investigate are : @xmath47 the final two models have the slip length related to the height of the fluid region , with @xmath48 , see figure [ fig : fig1_hs_wedge ] , and for these two models clearly we are restricted to contact angles @xmath49 .",
    "whilst less used , the final two models do appear in the literature . in relation to",
    "the droplet spreading problem which this work will focus on , noteworthy are works by greenspan @xcite who used a form of the ` inverse linear slip ' condition , and the work of haley and miksis @xcite , who employ all three above slip conditions . in the long - wave limit ,",
    "the ` inverse linear slip ' boundary condition reduces to a slip condition proposed by ruckenstein and dunn @xcite , which scales with the pressure gradient , as shown in @xcite .",
    "we now consider the asymptotic behaviour of the various slip models given in ( [ eq : slipmods ] ) .",
    "this should then allow us to choose an appropriate form for the stream function , and thus the general solution of the biharmonic equation for each model .",
    "we use the form of @xmath50 from ( [ eq : stressinpolar ] ) , with the stream function from ( [ eq : genewtonian ] ) , and the separable form of the stream function in ( [ eq : newton : psib ] ) to obtain @xmath51 consider ( [ eq : slipmodsr ] ) now to determine @xmath25 . in the no - slip case ,",

    "the solutions for the different slip models in the moffatt wedge setting may be found in appendix  [ app : wedge ] , however the important results are that the navier - slip model removes the singularity in the stress as the contact line is approached , but a logarithmic singularity in the pressure remains .",

    "however , it is also possible to cancel the logarithmic pressure terms by relaxing the assumption of constant surface tension , thus obtaining a finite pressure solution . more specifically , from ( [ eq : bctanst ] ) , where @xmath252 is the surface gradient of @xmath40 , and which given in terms of the usual gradient operator is @xmath253 , we can determine the dynamic boundary condition as @xmath254 now using the pressure equations from ( [ eq : stressinpolar ] ) with @xmath249 gives @xmath255 and thus ( at leading order in @xmath256 ) @xmath257 . to have a pressure without a singularity",
    "requires @xmath258 , and this third order ode has the general solution @xmath259 where @xmath260 are constant coefficients . from ( [ eq : eqf ] ) and ( [ eq : bhedeg ] ) , we thus impose stream function form @xmath261 keeping two orders in @xmath256 so as to obtain the leading order term in the pressure behaviour .",
    "we find after applying the boundary conditions ( including ( [ eq : bctsgradsig ] ) ) with navier - slip @xmath262 displaying the mathematical possibility of such a flow .",
    "we note here as part of the result the form of the surface tension was forced to satisfy @xmath263 which gives a reasonable result for the surface tension @xmath40 , that it is a constant to leading order when @xmath264 , the regime in which we are interested .",
    "this also gives a motivation as to why a model which allows for variable surface tension , i.e.  surface tension relaxation , may be able to predict a flow which has no logarithmic pressure singularity , but finite and non - zero stresses at the contact line .",
    "such surface tension relaxation is a feature of the interface formation model @xcite , where the surface tension is given as @xmath265 and the surface density is a function of position and time , i.e.  @xmath266 .",
    "motivated by the analysis of @xcite and the matching conditions ( [ eq : innmatch ] ) , we introduce the intermediate scalings @xmath267 where @xmath268 .",

    "clearly suggests matching should be performed with the cube of the free surface slope , indeed we find from ( [ eq : intmpower ] ) using scalings ( [ eq : intscals ] ) ( with our result that @xmath275 ) that @xmath276 } } \\right)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the same result as would be found directly from the inner region behaviour ( [ eq : innmatch ] ) . from the outer region behaviour ( [ eq : outbehav ] ) we have @xmath277},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and thus the matching of these provides the spreading rate result given in ( [ eq : srr ] ) .",
