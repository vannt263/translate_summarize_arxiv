    "in this paper we consider geometric graphs ( i.e. , graphs whose vertices are points in the plane , and whose edges are segments connecting pairs of vertices ) , and in particular , convex geometric graphs ( i.e. , geometric graphs whose vertices are in convex position in the plane ) .    a simple perfect matching ( spm ) in a geometric graph on @xmath0 vertices is a set of @xmath2 pairwise disjoint edges ( i.e. , edges that do not intersect , not even in an interior point ) .",
    "a natural turn - type question ( considered , e.g. , in  @xcite ) is : what is the maximal possible number of edges in a geometric graph on @xmath0 vertices with no simple perfect matching ?    an equivalent way to state",
    "the question is to consider sets which `` block '' all the spms :    a set of edges in a geometric graph @xmath3 is called a blocking set if it intersects ( i.e. , contains an edge of ) every spm of the graph .",
    "using this formulation , the question above is equivalent to the question :    what is the minimal size ( i.e. , number of edges ) of a blocking set in a complete geometric graph on @xmath0 vertices ?",
    "it appears that the answer depends on the position of the vertices of the graph in the plane .",
    "it is easy to show that there always exists a blocking set of size @xmath4 , and there exists a configuration in the plane for which @xmath4 is the minimal possible size .",
    "on the other hand , in an unpublished work  ( @xcite ) , perles proved that for any placement of the vertices , the size of a blocking set is at least @xmath2 .",
    "this lower bound is attained ( among other cases ) in the case of convex geometric graphs ( cgg . ) indeed , consider a complete convex geometric graph on @xmath0 vertices , denoted in the sequel @xmath5 .",
    "the vertices of the graph form a convex polygon .",
    "it is easy to see that any set of @xmath2 consecutive edges on the boundary of the polygon is a blocking set .",
    "the set of all edges of odd order emanating from a single vertex is also clearly a blocking set of size @xmath2 .. ]    in this paper we present a complete characterization of the blocking sets of size @xmath2 in @xmath5 , called in the sequel _ blockers_.",
    "it turns out that all these blockers are simple subtrees of a special structure , called _ caterpillars _ ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "a tree @xmath6 is a caterpillar ( or a fishbone ) if the derived graph @xmath7 ( i.e. , the graph obtained from @xmath6 by removing all leaves and their incident edges ) is a path ( or is empty ) .",
    "a geometric caterpillar is simple if it does not contain a pair of crossing edges .",
    "a longest ( simple ) path in a caterpillar @xmath6 is called a spine of @xmath6 .",
    "our main result is the following :    let @xmath8 be the set of vertices of a convex @xmath0-gon @xmath9 , labelled cyclically from @xmath10 to @xmath4 , and let @xmath3 be the complete convex geometric graph on @xmath8 .",
    "any blocker of @xmath3 is a simple caterpillar graph whose spine lies on the boundary of the polygon and is of length @xmath11 .",

    "an example of a blocker in @xmath19 is presented in figure  [ fig : t1 ] .",

    "since @xmath34 is a prefect matching , it contains an edge emanating from @xmath41 . by the explanation above",

    "the directions define an equivalence relation , whose equivalence classes consist of all the boundary edges and diagonals of the same direction . the equivalence classes of the first type ( odd order ) contain two boundary edges and @xmath47 diagonals , and the equivalence classes of the second type ( even order ) contain @xmath48 diagonals",
