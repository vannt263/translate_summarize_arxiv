    "in physics , all fundamental conservation laws are expected to have associated symmetries .",
    "lepton flavor conservation , however , is an experimentally observed phenomena with no associated symmetry in the standard model .",
    "lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) is expected in many extensions of the standard model such as lepto - quark , supersymmetry , superstring , left - right symmetric models , and models that include heavy neutral leptons  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , both super kamiokande  @xcite and sno  @xcite observe neutrino oscillation , which may imply lfv in the neutrino sector , therefore lfv is expected to occur in charged lepton decay at some branching fraction , albeit very small .",
    "the @xmath0 lepton provides a clean laboratory for such searches .",
    "ilakovac  @xcite has calculated upper limits on branching fractions for many neutrinoless lfv modes within a model involving heavy dirac neutrinos .",
    "the branching fractions depend on the heavy neutrino masses and mixings . for the decays",
    "@xmath8  @xcite , the branching fractions are of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 can be @xmath11 or @xmath12 . for the decays @xmath13 or @xmath14 , the branching fractions are of @xmath15 .",
    "the decays with two kaons in the final state are therefore of particular experimental interest .",
    "previous published upper limits on the branching fractions for the decays @xmath8 are of @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "there are no previous results for the decays @xmath13 . in this paper",
    ", we present the result of a search for the decays into one lepton and one or two @xmath1 mesons , with the @xmath1 decaying into two charged pions .",
    "the data used in this analysis were collected using the cleo detector  @xcite from @xmath17 collisions at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) at a center - of - mass energy @xmath18 gev .",
    "the total integrated luminosity of the data sample is 13.9 @xmath2 corresponding to the production of @xmath19 @xmath20 events .",
    "the cleo detector is a general purpose spectrometer with excellent charged particle and shower energy detection .",
    "the @xmath20 candidate events must contain four or six charged tracks with zero net charge . to reject beam - gas events ,",
    "the distance of closest approach of each non-@xmath1 track to the ip must be within 0.5 cm transverse to the beam and 5 cm along the beam direction .",
    "the polar angle @xmath21 of each track with respect to the beam must satisfy @xmath22 .",
    "photons are defined as energy clusters in the calorimeter with at least 60 mev in the barrel ( @xmath23 ) or 100 mev in the endcap ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we further require every photon to be separated from the projection of any charged track by at least 30 cm unless its energy is greater than 300 mev . in order to diminish qed background such as radiative bhabha and @xmath12-pair events with photon conversion , we require each event to have total energy less than 95% of the center - of - mass energy .",
    "this requirement rejects most of the qed background , while incurring a small loss in detection efficiency .",
    "we divide each event into two hemispheres ( signal and tag ) , one containing one charged track and the other containing three or five charged tracks , using the plane perpendicular to the thrust axis  @xcite .",
    "the thrust axis is calculated from both charged tracks and photons .",
    "the invariant mass of the tag hemisphere must be less than the @xmath0 mass , @xmath25  gev/@xmath26  @xcite .",
    "the signal hemisphere must contain an electron or a muon and one or two @xmath1 mesons .",
    "the electron candidate must have shower energy to momentum ratio in the range , @xmath27 , and when available , the specific ionization lost must be consistent with an electron .",
    "the muon candidate must penetrate at least three absorbtion lengths of iron .",
    "the @xmath1 candidate is reconstructed in the @xmath28 final state with a detached vertex , and the invariant mass must be within approximately three standard deviations of the nominal mass , @xmath29 mev/@xmath26 . in order to diminish radiative bhabha and @xmath12-pair events further , neither pion should be consistent with identification as an electron .",
    "since there is no neutrino in the signal hemisphere while there is at least one neutrino undetected in the tag hemisphere , the missing momentum of the event must point toward the tag hemisphere , @xmath30 . in order to suppress the background from radiative bhabha and @xmath12-pair events , the direction of the missing momentum of the event is required to satisfy @xmath31 . for the decay @xmath32 , @xmath33",
    "is further restricted to be less than 0.99 to reduce the radiative backgrounds .",
    "this corresponds to the minimum ratio of background to detection efficiency .",
    "the background is estimated from the sidebands in the invariant mass vs. total energy distribution of the decay candidates .    to search for decay candidates , we select @xmath0 candidates with invariant mass and total energy consistent with the expectations .",
    "the following kinematic variables are used to select the candidate events : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the beam energy , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the reconstructed @xmath0 energy and mass .",

    "the phase space model is appropriate for an unpolarized tau .",
    "if the lorentz structure of the neutrinoless decay is v - a ( standard model - like ) , correlations between the spins of the two @xmath0 s in the event will lead to slightly higher detection efficiency than phase space , while v+a decays will lead to lower detection efficiency .",

    "no candidate decays are observed , so we take @xmath46 as 2.44 events in each mode at 90% confidence level , according to the frequentist method  @xcite .",
    "the upper limits on the branching fractions with and without systematic errors are shown in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "the systematic errors include the uncertainties in the @xmath20 cross section ( 1% ) , luminosity ( 1% ) , track reconstruction efficiency ( 1% per charged track ) , @xmath1 detection efficiency ( 2% per @xmath1 ) , lepton identification ( 1.5% for electron and 4% for muon ) , and the statistical uncertainties in the detection efficiencies due to limited monte carlo samples ( 1 - 2% ) .",
