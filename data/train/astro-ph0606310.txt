    "strange stars are hypothetical compact stars which are built entirely or almost entirely of strange quark matter ( containing light @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 quarks and possibly electrons ) .",

    "strange stars are attracting permanent attention ( see , e.g. , a recent review of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one can not exclude that at least some stars , which are currently thought to be neutron stars , are in fact strange stars .",
    "the theories predict the existence of bare strange stars ( with the strange matter extended to the very surface ) and strange stars with a thin crust of normal matter extended not deeper than the neutron drip point ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the normal crust may occur , for instance , due to accretion of normal matter onto a bare strange star .",
    "strange stars of masses @xmath6 much lower than the `` canonical '' neutron - star mass , @xmath7 , are predicted to have radii @xmath8 km , essentially smaller than the radii of neutron stars . however , strange stars with @xmath7 have nearly the same radii , @xmath9 km , as typical neutron stars .",
    "we will show that strange stars with crusts could be potentionally distinguished from neutron stars by their oscillation spectra .",

    "@xcite studied three types of quadrupole oscillations of strange stars and hybrid neutron stars .",
    "they found some differences in oscillation frequencies of such stars . also , they demonstrated that the damping times of oscillations are sensitive to the model of strange matter .",
    "recently @xcite showed that the combined knowledge of the frequency of emitted gravitational waves and the mass or radius of a compact object would allow one to discriminate between a strange star and a neutron star and set stringent bounds on the parameters of quark matter .",
    "both groups of authors analyzed global oscillations of strange stars .    in this paper",

    "we have studied oscillations localized in a neutron star crust due to large multipolarity @xmath10 . here",
    "we show that acoustic oscillations in a strange star crust are very specific even for low @xmath0 because of a huge density jump at the interface between the normal crust and the quark core .",

    "finally , for @xmath131 , the oscillations are localized in the outer layers of the crust , and their frequencies become the same as for neutron stars .    oscillations of strange stars with crust have several specific features which can be used to distinguish them from oscillations of neutron stars .    *",

    ". the crust temperature ( important for the viscous damping ) is assumed to be @xmath133  k and the magnetic field strength at the magnetic poles is @xmath134  g. for higher @xmath23 the viscous damping time becomes larger .",

    "this huge difference is produced by several damping mechanisms .",
    "in particular , radial oscillations ( @xmath43 ) decay exclusively through the viscous dissipation ( generating neither gravitational nor electromagnetic radiation ) .",

    "their damping times are relatively large , up to @xmath141  years .",
    "the exclusion is provided by the modes with @xmath142 and 4 , which decay quicker via the emission of electromagnetic waves .    for p modes ( with at least one radial node ) the picture is different .",
    "the modes with @xmath143 decay primarily though the electromagnetic channel . because neither oscillation frequency nor @xmath32 depend on @xmath0 ( see section [ subsecnonradosc ] ) , the @xmath0-dependence of the dissipation time is fully determined by the electromagnetic energy losses ( see eq .",

    "note that for lower @xmath144  g , the main damping mechanism of modes with @xmath145 consists in the emission of gravitational waves , while the electromagnetic channel is important only for dipole modes .",
    "to conclude , the fundamental modes and all radial oscillations have damping times exceeding 1 year and have better chances to be detected .",
    "the modes with @xmath102 have also relatively large damping times @xmath146 year , but it could be difficult to excite and detect them owing to large multipolarity .",
    "let us assume that some oscillation frequencies are detected and corresponding modes are identified .",
    "the frequencies of pressure modes ( in the local stellar reference frame ) are given by eq .",
    "( [ radfreq ] ) . then the measured frequencies @xmath147 would give us the value of @xmath148 the frequencies of fundamental models are given by eq.([fundfreq ] ) .",

    "we would obtain two equations ( for @xmath151 and @xmath152 ) for two important unknown stellar parameters , the mass @xmath6 and the radius @xmath160 , and could determine these parameters .",
    "if we do not know @xmath62 , we would be unable to determine @xmath6 and @xmath160 , but could constrain them taking into account that @xmath62 can not exceed the neutron drip density @xmath161  g@xmath120 ( for the accreted envelope ) .",
    "substituting @xmath162 into ( [ h ] ) and @xmath155 into ( [ c ] ) we would obtain the upper limit on @xmath160 . with this upper limit",
    ", we could easily derive the upper limit on @xmath6 from the value of @xmath163 .",
    "if , on the other hand , the mass @xmath6 is known from independent observations ( e.g. , the star enters to a binary system ) then the equations for @xmath151 and @xmath152 would allow one to determine @xmath160 and @xmath155 .",
    "note , that we do not include density discontinuous g modes into our analysis .",
    "the frequencies of these modes depend on many factors ( such as the densities of phase transitions , associated density jumps , etc . ) .",
    "the uncertainties of such factors would complicate the theoretical interpretation of measured g mode frequencies .",
    "however , if observed , g modes could provide some useful additional information .",
    "for instance , the number of such modes for a fixed @xmath164 is equal to the number of phase transitions @xmath165 ( this statement is strict only in the absence of other sources of buoyancy ) .",
    "this number could bound the maximum crust density @xmath62 in the region between theoretically predicted @xmath165-th and @xmath166-th phase transitions and impose then better bounds on the inferred values of @xmath6 and @xmath160 .",
    "we have studied pressure oscillations of strange star crusts .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) the oscillations are almost insensitive to the various modifications of the eos in the normal crust .",
    "the polytropic eos provides approximately the same eigenfrequencies as the eos of the accreted crust , except for density discontinuous g modes , which are absent for the polytropic eos ( see section [ secnumres ] and figure [ fig_freq ] ) .",
    "( 2 ) the oscillation problem for acoustic modes is self - similar ( in the plane - parallel approximation ) .",
    "once the problem is solved for one stellar model , it can easily be rescaled to strange star models with any mass and radius ( but the same eos and the maximum crust density ; see section [ secformal ] ) .",
    "\\(3 ) for a thin polytropic crust , the oscillation problem is solved analytically ( sections [ subsecnonradosc ] and [ subsecradosc ] ) .",
    "\\(4 ) the oscillation spectrum of a strange star crust is _",
    "specific_. the frequencies of fundamental modes depend linearly on @xmath0 ; the frequencies of p modes are almost independent of @xmath0 .",
    "these features are _ unmistakable seismic signatures of strange stars with crust _ ( section  [ secnumres ] ) .",
    "\\(5 ) a detection and identification of one fundamental mode and one p mode would enable one , in principle , to infer the mass and radius of a strange star ( if the maximum crust density is known ) or at least to obtain corresponding upper limits ( section [ subsecstarparams ] )",
    ".    therefore , oscillation modes of strange stars with crust are potentially good tools to distinguish these strange stars from neutron stars and to determine their masses and radii .",
    "the oscillation frequencies could be detected by radio - astronomical methods very precisely .",
    "a search for these oscillation modes could be useful .",
    "some of them do not damp quickly and can survive for a long time ( section [ secnumres ] ) .",
