    "novae are all semi - detached binary systems where a late - type star transfers mass to a white dwarf companion @xcite . a thermonuclear runaway",
    "eventually ensues in the material accreted onto the surface of the white dwarf resulting in the nova explosion @xcite . the resulting release of energy ( @xmath4  @xmath5  @xmath6 ergs ) is sufficient to expel the accreted envelope and drive substantial mass loss ( @xmath7@xmath8  m@xmath9 ) from the system at high velocities ( @xmath4several hundreds to a few thousand km  s@xmath10 ; * ? ? ?",
    "novae exhibit outburst amplitudes of roughly 10 to 20  mag , and can reach peak luminosities as high as m@xmath11 , second only to grb and supernovae in the energetics of their outbursts , but far more frequent in a given galaxy than either .",
    "their high luminosities and rates ( @xmath12  yr@xmath10 in a galaxy like m31 [ shafter & irby 2001 ; darnley et al .",
    "2006 ] ) , make novae powerful probes of the properties of binary star systems in different ( extragalactic ) stellar populations .",
    "the rapid formation of copious amounts of dust in many novae post - outburst also makes them unique laboratories in which to explore cosmic dust grain formation @xcite .",
    "models show that properties of the eruption ( e.g. the peak luminosity and the decline rate ) are strongly dependent on parameters such as the accretion rate , and the mass and luminosity of the white dwarf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , some or all of which may vary systematically with the underlying stellar population .",
    "the strength of the nova outburst is most sensitive to the mass of the accreting white dwarf , with the increased surface gravity of a more massive white dwarf resulting in a higher pressure at the base of the accreted envelope at the time of thermonuclear runaway and a more violent outburst .",
    "in addition , since a smaller mass of accreted material is required to achieve the critical temperature and density necessary for a runaway , nova outbursts produced on massive white dwarfs are expected to have shorter recurrence times and faster light curve evolution @xcite .",
    "further , since the mean white dwarf mass in a nova system is expected to decrease as a function of the time elapsed since the formation of the progenitor binary ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the proportion of fast and bright novae is expected to be higher in a younger stellar population , which should contain on average more massive white dwarfs .",
    "@xcite became the first to formally postulate the existence of two populations of novae : a relatively young population of `` disc novae '' , which are found in the solar neighborhood and in the lmc , and `` bulge novae '' , which are concentrated towards the galactic center and in the bulge of m31 , and are characterized by generally slower outburst development . the argument in favor of two nova populations was further developed by @xcite , who showed that the average scale height above the galactic plane for `` fast '' novae ( @xmath13  d is the time in days a nova takes to decline by two magnitudes from maximum light . ] ) is smaller than for novae with slower rates of decline . at about the same time",
    ", @xcite was proposing that classical novae could be divided into two classes based on their spectral properties : specifically , the relative strengths of either their fe  ii or he and n emission lines . novae with prominent fe  ii lines ( `` fe  ii novae '' ) usually show p  cygni absorption profiles , tend to evolve more slowly , have lower expansion velocities , and have a lower level of ionization , compared with novae that exhibit strong lines of he and n ( `` he / n novae '' ) .",
    "in addition , the latter novae display very strong neon lines , but not the forbidden lines that are often seen in the fe  ii novae .",
    "following up on their earlier work , @xcite noted that galactic novae with well determined distances that were classified as he / n were concentrated near the galactic plane , and tended to be faster , and more luminous compared with their fe  ii counterparts .",
    "infrared observations offer another avenue for the study of nova populations . models for thermonuclear runaways on the surfaces of white dwarfs predict that the ejecta will contain not only accreted gas , but material dredged up from the white dwarf as well .",
    "thus , spectroscopic analysis of the ejecta offers an opportunity to distinguish between eruptions that occur on co white dwarfs and those occurring on more massive one white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "eruptions occurring on co white dwarfs are expected to produce a significant amount of dust , mainly in the form of carbon grains that shroud the central source , and result in warm ( @xmath41000  k ) blackbody emission that peaks in the near ir ( @xmath14 ) @xmath15 months after eruption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , eruptions seated on the more massive one white dwarfs are believed to produce strong forbidden lines of neon ( [ ne  ii ] @xmath2 and [ ne  vi ] @xmath16 ) , but little or no dust .",
    "the first observational support for a class of novae occurring on massive one white dwarfs was found more than twenty years ago when @xcite discovered that the [ ne  ii ] @xmath2 emission line in qu  vul ( @xmath17 ) reached a flux level @xmath18 times that of the free - free continuum more than four months after eruption . at the time , this was the strongest @xmath2 emission line seen in any astrophysical object . since that time",
    "several additional galactic novae with an overabundance of ne have been discovered , and they are collectively referred to as `` neon '' novae @xcite .",
    "it appears that up to one - third of novae are of this type , with the remainder being co novae .",
    "although much can and has been learned from the study of galactic novae , the nearby spiral m31 , where more than 800 nova candidates have been discovered over the past century ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , offers a unique opportunity to study an equidistant sample of novae from differing stellar environments ( bulge and disk ) while minimizing some of the uncertainties that plague galactic observations ( e.g. , highly variable extinction along the lines of sight to different novae ) . with this motivation in mind ,",
    "we are currently involved in a multi - wavelength program of photometric and spectroscopic follow - up observations of novae discovered in m31 @xcite . as a part of this effort focusing on the nature of the white dwarfs ( co vs one ) , we have obtained both ir photometric and spectroscopic observations of a sample of 10 novae in m31 using the irac and irs instruments on board the _ spitzer _ space telescope .",
    "here , we present the results of our survey .",
    "in order to search for dust formation in a sample of m31 novae we initiated a program of _ spitzer _ infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ? * ) and infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) observations in early 2007 and 2008 .",
    "our observing strategy called for the observations to be triggered approximately three months after discovery of a nova . however , due to the vagaries of _ spitzer _ scheduling , our observations were typically executed anywhere from 3 to as long as 7 months after eruption .    during the first year of observations ,",
    "the same 4 novae were observed with both irac and the irs .",
    "the results from the irs observations were disappointing , with no line emission detected in any nova , and continuous emission detected in just two of the novae .",
    "we concluded that most novae had likely faded beyond detectability by the time the irs observations were scheduled . in order to increase the probability of detection , in the second epoch of observations",
    ", we were able to modify our irs target list to include two more recent novae for observation : m31n  2007 - 11d and 2007 - 11e , resulting in line emission being detected in one of these novae .",
    "our _ spitzer _ observations are summarized in table  [ spitzersummary ] .",
    "irac data were obtained in all four irac bands ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) .",
    "the irac observations consisted of a 12 point reuleaux dither pattern with a medium scale factor .",
    "a single 100  sec frame was obtained at each dither position , resulting in a total of @xmath41200  sec of exposure in each band .",
    "source extraction and photometry were performed on the post - bcd ( basic calibrated data ) mosaics produced by the _",
    "science center ( ssc ) , pipeline version 18.5 .",
    "the extractions and determination of uncertainties were performed using version 2.1 of the idl program atv , written and maintained by @xcite . due to the crowded nature of the observed fields along with rapidly varying background levels ,",
    "it was necessary to use apertures of minimal size to avoid contamination from neighboring objects . therefore we chose an aperture size of radius 2 pixels for each extraction .",
    "we used the nominal positions of the novae as determined by visual photometric observations , along with an atv 3-pixel - radius centering box , to determine the center for each aperture used in extraction .",
    "aperture correction factors , derived by the ssc and provided in the irac data handbook 3.0 , were then used to estimate the true flux of the novae based on the measured flux in each aperture .",
    "finally , we determined the background level for each aperture using an annulus of inner radius of 2 pixels and outer radius 6 pixels .",
    "the energy distributions for the six novae detected by irac are shown in figure  [ iracsed ] and summarized in table  [ iractab ] .",
    "irs data were obtained in the low resolution sl1 module , covering a wavelength range of @xmath23 .",
    "the irs data were obtained using 24 cycles of 60  sec ramps .",
    "as each cycle of an irs observation consists of two nod positions , this resulted in a total of @xmath42880  sec of on - source integration time per target .",
    "the irs data were analyzed in the smart package @xcite using optimal extraction @xcite .",
    "the bcd ( basic calibrated data ) products were cleaned using the irsclean tool with campaign specific masks before all 2d spectra at a given nod position were combined into a single image . for our observations , this resulted in two @xmath41440  sec cleaned two dimensional spectra . prior to spectral extraction , the two nod positions were subtracted from each other to remove the background and mitigate rogue pixels not present in the masks .",
    "the spectral extraction was performed on these background subtracted images . for each object , we selected the `` manual optimal extraction '' option in smart .",
    "the position of the irs slit was projected on our irac images to verify that we were extracting spectra for the correct object . a visual inspection of the two dimensional spectra revealed that only 2 objects ( m31n  2006 - 09c and 2006 - 10a ) had clear traces at the nominal source position .",
    "for the remaining objects ( with the exception of m31n  2007 - 11e , see below ) , we extracted spectra at the nominal source position in each nod position .",
    "as expected from the visual inspection of the two dimensional spectra , no sources were detected . in the case of m31n  2006 - 09c ,",
    "the nova was the only detected source .",
    "the spectrum of m31n  2006 - 09c was extracted using the optimal extraction algorithm with a background order of one ; even though background subtraction was accomplished to first order by subtracting nod positions , residual structure was still present owing to the variation of the local background between the nod positions . in the case of m31n  2006 - 10a ,",
    "there were two objects detected , the brighter nova at the nominal position in the slit as well as a fainter source offset by @xmath43 pixels ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "to extract m31n  2006 - 10a , two sources were specified and the extraction algorithm was allowed to fit the trace within one pixel of the nominal position ( for the nova ) and between one and four pixels from the nominal position for the contaminating source . in the case of m31n  2007 - 11e ,",
    "no source was apparent save for a faint line at the position of [ ne  ii ] @xmath2 . for m31n  2007 - 11e , we forced the extraction aperture to be centered on the nominal source position for each nod .",
    "for all three objects , spectra extracted at each nod position were clipped at the order edges and combined .",
    "the spectra extracted for m31n  2006 - 09c and 2006 - 10a are shown in figure  [ irsed1 ] and the extracted spectrum of m31n  2007 - 11e is shown in figure  [ irsed2 ] .      to complement our _ spitzer",
    "_ observations , we attempted to obtain optical photometric time - series of several novae in our survey using the liverpool telescope ( lt , * ? ? ? * ) , primarily to measure the peak nova brightness and rate of decline ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the lt data were reduced using a combination of iraf and starlink software .",
    "these data were calibrated with standard stars from @xcite and checked against secondary standards from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these observations were augmented by the extensive photometric database compiled by one of us ( kh ) as part of an on - going program to monitor nova light curves in m31 .",
    "the latter observations include both survey and targeted images taken with the 0.35-m telescope of private observatory of kh at lelekovice , the 0.65-m telescope of the ondejov observatory ( operated partly by the charles university , prague ) , and the 0.28-m telescope of the zln observatory .",
    "standard reduction procedures for raw ccd images were applied ( bias and dark - frame subtraction and flat - field correction ) using sims and munipack programs .",
    "reduced images of the same series were co - added to improve the s / n ratio ( total exposure time varied from ten minutes up to about one hour ) .",
    "the gradient of the galaxy background of co - added images was flattened by a spatial median filter using sims .",
    "these processed images were then used to search for novae .",
    "photometry was performed using `` optimal photometry '' ( based on fitting of psf profiles ) in gaia , and calibrated with standard stars from @xcite .",
    "of the ten novae observed by _",
    "spitzer _ we were successful in obtaining a series of photometric observations for five of the novae .",
    "the results of these observations are summarized in tables  [ phot1 ]  [ phot5 ] , with the resulting light curves shown in figures  [ lc1 ]  [ lc3 ] .",
    "in addition to our ground - based photometric observations , we also attempted to obtain optical spectroscopic observations of each nova using the low resolution spectrograph ( lrs ; * ? ? ? * ) on the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) .",
    "we used either the @xmath25 grating with a 1.0@xmath26 slit and the gg385 blocking filter covering 415011000  at a resolution of @xmath27 , or the @xmath28 grating with a 2.0@xmath26 slit and the gg385 blocking filter , covering 42757250  at a resolution of @xmath29 .",
    "when employing the lower - dispersion @xmath25 grating , we limited our analysis to the 41509000  wavelength range where the effects of order overlap are minimal .",
    "the spectra were reduced using standard iraf routines to flat - field the data and to optimally extract the spectra .",
    "a summary of all the het observations is given in table  [ hettab ] . because the observations were made under a variety of atmospheric conditions with the stellar image typically overfilling the spectrograph slit , our data are not spectrophotometric .",
    "thus , the data have been displayed on a relative flux scale .",
    "spectra were successfully obtained for eight of the ten novae observed by _",
    "these data , which were obtained primarily to ascertain the spectroscopic classes @xcite and ejection velocities of the novae , are shown in figures  [ het1 ]  [ het3 ] , and are summarized in tables  [ emission ] and [ spatpos ] .",
    "spectroscopic classes for the two novae that we were unable to observe , m31n  2007 - 07f and 2007 - 08a , were available through spectra obtained by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "seven of the ten novae in our sample clearly belong to the fe  ii class , which is characterized by relatively narrow balmer and fe  ii emission . of the remaining three , m31n  2006 - 10b was a  hybrid \" nova ( a broad - lined fe  ii system that later evolved into a he / n system ) , while m31n  2007 - 08a was described by @xcite as an fe  ii ( or possibly a hybrid ) nova .",
    "the large balmer emission line widths seen in m31n  2006 - 10b are typical of what is found in he / n novae ; however , the relatively narrow lines exhibited by 2007 - 08a are more characteristic of the fe  ii class .",
    "the remaining nova , m31n  2007 - 10a , is quite peculiar spectroscopically ( see figure  [ het2 ] ) .",
    "the spectrum displays narrow emission characteristic of the fe  ii novae , but in addition to balmer emission , shows prominent he  i lines rather than fe  ii emission .",
    "the spatial positions of the 10 novae in our _ spitzer _ sample are shown in figure  [ spat ] .",
    "as has been demonstrated by @xcite from a larger sample of novae , there is no evidence that the spatial distribution of fe  ii and he / n novae differ in m31 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "of the 8 novae observed by irac , only m31n  2006 - 10a shows clear evidence of an infrared excess in the irac bands , peaking at @xmath30 ( see fig .  [ irsed1 ] ) . m31n  2007 - 07f shows evidence for a rather weaker , slightly longer wavelength excess ( see fig .",
    "[ iracsed ] ) .",
    "we may associate such excess emission with that from dust grains condensing in the ejecta of each nova , as has been observed in many galactic novae  see section 1 . both m31n",

    "a summary is presented in table  [ dust ] . in figure  [ tcond ]",
    "we have plotted the condensation time , @xmath33 , of dust grains in galactic novae against @xmath34 .",
    "dust condensation times for this plot have been taken from table 13.1 of @xcite and times of dust breaks in d - type novae from @xcite .",
    "in general , these are consistent within a few days , but we have taken the earlier quoted time in each case , if they are both available for a given nova . speed class , in terms of @xmath34 , has been taken from @xcite .",
    "we have also plotted the two suspected dusty m31 novae on figure  [ tcond ] , where @xmath33 is likely to be an upper limit in both instances ( i.e. we have not necessarily observed the onset of the dust formation event ) .",
    "note that for m31n  2006 - 10a and 2007 - 11d , we have used @xmath34(@xmath35 ) but as this was unavailable for the other m31 novae , we have used @xmath34(@xmath36 ) .",
    "there is a clear trend for the galactic novae in the sense that the faster novae tend to form grains earlier than the slow novae .",
    "an outlier is nova pw vul .",
    "@xcite note that this nova had a very erratic early optical light curve which resembled dq her , but showed no deep minimum as did the latter , archetypal dust - forming nova . indeed pw vul s dust shell was also low mass and optically thin and the quoted value of @xmath37 days was calculated by @xcite from the angular expansion rate of the pseudo - photosphere and the maximum flux of the outburst .",
    "this is consistent with the time of first condensation being in the observational gap between 100 and 290 days post - outburst .",
    "also shown as a lower limit on this plot is the dust condensation time for qu vul , given by @xcite as 40200 days ( we will return to this object below ) .",
    "marking an extreme point on the plot is nova v445 pup .",
    "a dust extinction dip is clearly seen in its light curve and ( relatively sparse ) infrared photometry thereafter confirms the presence of an extensive dust shell , but this is an example of a very rare helium nova outburst ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the apparent correlation between @xmath33 and @xmath24 is perhaps surprising .",
    "if we assume a constant central source luminosity , @xmath38 , and outflow velocity , @xmath39 , for a given nova , and that the grain condensation temperature , @xmath40 , is constant from nova to nova , we can write ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath41    adopting available empirical relations between @xmath39 and @xmath24 , and between @xmath38 and @xmath24 ( the maximum - magnitude vs rate - of - decline relation ) such as those given in @xcite , we find that @xmath42 and @xmath43 . after inserting these relations into eqn  ( 1 ) , it appears that @xmath33 should be essentially independent of nova speed class ! clearly , the empirical correlation shown in figure  [ tcond ] justifies further investigation , but as pointed out by @xcite , dust grain nucleation and growth rely on a complex set of parameters . finally , it should be noted that not all novae form detectable amounts of dust , with examples at both ends of the range of speed class ( e.g. v1500 cyg versus hr del ; * ? ? ?",
    "the reasons for this have been explored by various authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but are not fully understood .",
    "figure  [ tirmax ] shows a plot of nova speed class versus the time of maximum infrared flux , @xmath44 , as observed in galactic novae .",
    "since @xmath44 is not available for our m31 novae , we have instead plotted the speed class and time after discovery ( approximate optical maximum ) for the novae observed with irac . both m31n",
    "2006 - 10a and 2007 - 07f are marked on the plot .",
    "again there appears to be a trend of increasing @xmath44 with speed class for the galactic novae , with the exception of qu vul .",
    "we may note however that this is the time of the maximum flux observed in the @xmath45 silicate feature in this nova by @xcite at @xmath46 days , and not necessarily the time of maximum continuum emission from grains in the expanding shell , which may have been ( much ) earlier .",
    "indeed , an observation on day 206 for this nova by @xcite showed that at this time emission from graphitic dust clearly dominated the @xmath45 continuum in qu vul .    from figure  [ tirmax ]",
    ", it appears that m31n  2006 - 10a may have been observed by _",
    "spitzer _ nearer the time of the infrared emission maximum than 2007 - 07f , which again is consistent with the higher dust shell luminosity and inferred dust temperature in 2006 - 10a compared to 2007 - 07f .",
    "indeed , m31 2006 - 10a might have been observed not too long after @xmath33 at around the time of @xmath44 .",
    "evidence for this comes from its position on figs .",
    "[ tcond ] and [ tirmax ] , coupled with @xmath47 ( @xmath48k ) being much lower than @xmath40 ( @xmath49k ) .",
    "there is in fact a steep drop in observed effective dust grain temperature in well observed dusty novae coinciding approximately with infrared maximum arising from what @xcite termed the  infrared pseudo - photosphere \" in the optically thick ( in the infrared ) dust shells of prolific dust formers such as nq vul @xcite .",
    "as the dust formation rate reduces in the expanding shell , the observed optical depth also reduces and @xmath47 increases again .",
    "@xcite found even better agreement with observations if grains were subject to some size reduction around the time of infrared maximum , possibly due to sputtering . in nq",
    "vul the temperature minimum lasted from around 62 to 130 days post - outburst .",
    "all but one of the faster m31 novae lie above the region occupied by the galactic novae at infrared maximum ( the exception being m31n  2006 - 11a ) .",
    "the non - detection of dust emission in these objects may then be due to them either being observed well after dust emission maximum , or the fact that they did not produce large amounts of dust in the first place .",
    "the latter appears to be the case for 2006 - 11a at least , as it does lie in the region of the plot occupied by the dusty galactic novae .",
    "we may estimate the total mass of dust in m31n  2006 - 10a , @xmath50 , assuming an isothermal , optically - thin dust shell of uniform spherical grains of radius @xmath51 from the equation    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the distance , @xmath54 the bulk density of the grain material , @xmath55 the observed flux density at wavelength @xmath56 , @xmath57 the planck function at @xmath56 and grain temperature @xmath58 , and @xmath59 the grain absorption coefficient . if @xmath60 for small dielectric absorbers , it can be shown that    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the wavelength of maximum emission in @xmath63 .",
    "in the case of m31n  2006 - 10a , the irs spectrum in figure[irsed1 ] shows no apparent @xmath45 silicate feature , and the emitting grains are more likely carbon - based , as seen at some point in the evolution of most dust - forming novae @xcite .",
    "taking for simplicity graphite spheres of size small compared with the wavelength of emission , then @xmath64 @xcite .",

    "this is consistent with the range of dust masses derived for galactic novae , particularly the more prolific dust - formers ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have conducted the first infrared survey of novae in the nearby spiral , m31 , using the _ spitzer _ space telescope . the primary motivation behind the survey was to determine the feasibility of using _ spitzer _ observations of m31 novae to study dust formation property as a function of nova speed class and spectroscopic type .",

    "eight of these novae were observed with irac ( all but m31n  2007 - 11d and 2007 - 11e ) and 8 with the irs ( all but m31n  2007 - 07f and 2007 - 08a ) , with 6 novae observed with both instruments .",
    "observations of galactic novae show that dust formation typically occurs with a timescale , @xmath33 , of between @xmath73 and @xmath74 months post - eruption ( mean @xmath75 months ) , depending on the speed class of the nova . for a typical nova ,",
    "the peak infrared signature occurs shortly thereafter , with the time to infrared maximum , @xmath44 , averaging about 3 months post - eruption .",
    "thus , our observing strategy was to schedule our _ spitzer _ observations approximately 3 months post discovery when the infrared signature due to dust formation was expected to reach a maximum .",
    "unfortunately , the constraints imposed by the _ spitzer _",
    "scheduling process did not allow us to time our observations as precisely as we would have liked , and our observations occurred anywhere between @xmath0 and @xmath1 months post eruption .",
    "our principal conclusions can be summarized as follows :    * ( 1 ) * we were able to detect six of the eight novae observed with irac .",
    "of these , only m31n  2006 - 10a showed clear evidence for an infrared excess peaking at @xmath30 .",
    "the irs spectrum of this nova showed no evidence of silicate emission features and thus we assume that the dust was carbon - based in this case .",
    "we were then able to estimate the total mass of dust formed to be @xmath76  m@xmath9 .",
    "this is comparable to the mass of dust found in galactic novae forming the more extensive dust shells .",
    "another nova , m31n  2007 - 07f , showed evidence of possible dust formation through a weaker infrared excess detected to peak at longer wavelength .",
    "our observations of these two novae occurred 116 and 203 days post discovery , respectively .",
    "thus , it is plausible that that our observations of m31n  2007 - 07f occurred after the peak ir flux was achieved as suggested by our comparison with the times of infrared maximum in galactic dust - forming novae .",
    "both novae are fe  ii systems with relatively slow light curve evolution : @xmath77  d and @xmath78  d , respectively .    *",
    "( 2 ) * we find a surprising correlation between the condensation time for dust grains ( @xmath33 ) and nova speed class ( @xmath24 ) for galactic novae ( see fig .  [ tcond ] ) .",
    "although upper limits , the values of @xmath33 for the two m31 novae with detected ir excesses are consistent with this correlation .",
    "most of the m31 novae in our sample , which have @xmath79 , were likely observed too long after dust condensation for us to detect an ir excess in our data .",
    "one exception is m31n  2006 - 11a , which is a moderate - speed - class , fe  ii nova observed less than 3 months after discovery .",
    "a comparison with galactic dust - forming novae ( see fig  [ tirmax ] ) shows that an ir excess likely would have been visible assuming dust formation had taken place .    * ( 3 ) * three of the eight novae observed with the irs were detected : m31n  2006  09c and 2006 - 10a showed only continuum emission , while 2007 - 11e revealed a [ ne ii ] @xmath2 emission feature characteristic of the class of  neon novae \" .",
    "other than its neon emission , m31n  2007 - 11e , is fairly unremarkable in other respects , being neither a particularly fast or slow fe  ii system .",
    "our preliminary survey has demonstrated that ir observations can be used to detect dust formation in m31 novae .",
    "it is likely that those novae that went undetected were observed too long after maximum light when the dust had cooled sufficiently to render the ir flux below our limit of detection .",
    "future observations , possibly from the ground , of a larger sample of novae will be required to further characterize the relationship between nova speed class , spectroscopic type , and dust formation timescales .",
    "the correlations we find between speed class and @xmath33 and @xmath44 will greatly assist observational planning .",
    "the work presented here is based in part on observations obtained with the hobby - eberly telescope , which is operated by mcdonald observatory on behalf of the university of texas at austin , the pennsylvania state university , stanford university , the ludwig - maximillians - universitaet , munich , and the george - august - universitaet , goettingen .",
