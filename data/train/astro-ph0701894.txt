    "molecular absorptions at intermediate redshift began to be studied more than a decade ago , after the discovery of co absorption in front of the bl lac object pks1413 + 135 at z=0.25 ( wiklind & combes 1994 ) .",
    "although many groups undertook active searches , there are still now only 5 molecular absorbing systems detected at high z : pks1413 + 135 and b3 1504 + 377 , which are self - absorbing systems , and 3 gravitational lens systems b0218 + 357 , pks1830 - 211 , pmn j0134 - 0931",
    "( with oh only ) .",
    "table 1 summarises the properties of these systems , together with the few local extra - galactic ones .    with respect to emission ,",
    "absorption measurements are quite sensitive , even to a small amount of molecular gas along the line of sight .",
    "the detection depends mainly on the background source intensity , and the rarity of the detections until now is due to that of strong millimetric radio sources . due to its sensitivity increase",
    ", there could be @xmath0 30 - 100 times more sources detected with alma .",
    "* scientific goals * the study of molecular absorbers at high - z allows to reach several goals :    * 1 * to detect molecules at high z with much more sensitivity ( down to 1 m@xmath1 ) than with emission and with complementary insight    * 2 * to study the evolution with z of chemical abondances : not only co lines are detectable , but molecular surveys are possible    * 3 * to measure the cmb temperature as a function of redshift , to independently estimate the hubble constant , through the time delay between two gravitational lens images    * 4 * to probe the variation of fundamental constants ( @xmath2 , g@xmath3 , @xmath4= m@xmath5/m@xmath3 ) .",
    "several theories based on superstrings , kaluza - klein theory , or compactified extra - dimensions , predict spatio - temporal variations of the fundamental constants ( uzan 2003 , murphy et al 2003 , chand et al 2006 ) .    *",
    "new local absorptions * the centaurus a ( ngc 5128 ) dust lane is well known to absorb in front of the strong internal radio source , and the absorption is diluted in the emission for the co lines ( the same phenomenon is occurring also for m82 in a lesser extent ) .",
    "the absorption is however completely detached for the high density tracers , like hco@xmath6 and hcn ( wiklind & combes 1997a ) .",
    "the absorption extends over very broad wings , suggesting perturbed kinematics , or outflows .",
    "recently , very broad absorption extending to the blue wing was observed in the hi line towards 3c 293 by morganti et al ( 2003 ) : the total width of 1400km / s absorption implies neutral gas entrained in the radio jet towards the observer .",
    "this observation is confirming theoretical expectations of agn feedback on the interstellar medium of the host galaxies .",
    "the 3c 293 host galaxy has already been observed in the co line , and found quite rich in molecular gas ( evans et al 1999 ) .",
    "garcia - burillo et al ( 2006 ) have observed this strong radio source at 1 mm and 3 mm with the iram interferometer , and found several absorption components , in co , hco@xmath6 and hcn .",
    "the high resolution helps to disentangle absorption from emission in the nucleus .",
    "the shape of the co emission map suggests an interaction between the jet and the ism , able to redirect the jet , and produce the hi outflow .",
    "the molecular lines are however not as broad as the hi line .",
    "the hco@xmath6 absorption has not only a component in front of the nucleus , but also in front of the radio jet .",
    "strong hco@xmath6 and co absorptions are also detected in front of 4c 31.04 , clearly on the blue - side of the total spectrum , delineated by emission .",

    "after the first system pks 1413 + 135 , another internal absorption was detected with several components in b3 1504 + 377 ( wiklind & combes 1996a ) .",

    "this means that the k - correction plays a very negative role here .",
    "in addition , the number of quasars per comoving volume is expected to decrease after z=2 .",
    "a solution is to follow the high - z quasars and their emission in red - shifting our observations , down to the centimeter domain .    with the present instrumentation at iram , a full search was undertaken with selection of candidates as : * 1 * strong mm source ( at least 0.15 jy at 3 mm ) , about 150 sources , searching at the host redshift when known , * 2 * or at a different z , if already an absorption is detected in hi-21 cm , or dlas , or mgii or caii ( e.g. carilli et al 1993 ) , * 3 * all mm - strong radio - source with a known gravitational lens ( vlbi ) ( webster et al 1995 , stickel & khr 1993 , jackson & browne 2007 ) .",

    "1km / s has been found : since the continuum source is highly variable , it was possible to probe the small scale structure of the interstellar medium ( wiklind & combes 1997b ) .    towards b3 1504 + 377 at z=0.672 ,",
    "7 different molecular absorption lines are detected , with a large separation 330km / s , which could be explained by a highly non - circular motions in the center , with a more regular spiral arm in the outer parts .",

    "the observation of several lines of the rotational ladder of the same molecule ( hcn , hnc , n2h@xmath6 , h@xmath38co@xmath6 , cs .. ) can then lead to a measure of t@xmath37 .",

    "the latter is split in 6 apparent images .",
    "surprisingly , only upper limits of hco@xmath6 or h@xmath10co lines were obtained on this source , probably due to small - scale structure of the ism , and very different continuum source extent across the radio spectrum .",
    "the absorption system provides a good probe of the fundamental constant variation .",
    "-6 mm      although laboratory measurements and solar system observations ( e.g. olive et al 2002 , uzan 2003 ) do not show evidence for time variations of the fundamental constant @xmath2 , high - z observations have revealed a possible variation over larger time - scales and also with space ( webb et al 2001 , murphy et al 2003 ) with some controversy ( chand et al 2006 , tzanavaris et al 2006 ) . while from alkali doublet ( civ , siii , siiv , mgii , aliii , .. ) on 22 absorbing systems and the `` many - multiplet '' method on 143 systems , a positive result @xmath39 = ( -0.6@xmath320.1 )",

    "independent methods with radio lines are then welcome to better understand the systematics of the various techniques .",
    "the radio domain has the big advantage of heterodyne techniques , with a spectral resolution of 10@xmath40 or more , and dealing with cold gas and narrow lines . also different constants can be probed , while comparing the optical lines with the hi 21 cm , the oh 18 cm and co or hco@xmath6 rotational lines , which depend very differently on @xmath2 , the electron - proton mass ratio @xmath4 = m@xmath5/m@xmath3 , or the proton gyromagnetic ratio g@xmath3 . in pks1413 + 135 , a resolution of 40 m/s is required to resolve the lines , and the obtained upper limits for variations on y = @xmath41 g@xmath42 are @xmath12y / y = ( -0.20 @xmath32 0.20 ) 10@xmath29 and @xmath12y / y = ( -0.16 @xmath320.36 ) 10@xmath29 for b0218 + 357 ( murphy et al 2001 ) .",

    "statistics with absorptions of hi and hco@xmath6 in our own galaxy in front of remote quasars ( lucas & liszt 1998 ) have measured a dispersion of about 1.2km / s , corresponding to @xmath12y / y = 0.4 10@xmath29 . the results combining lines in pmn j0134 - 0931 and b0218 + 357 on f = g@xmath43^{1.57}$ ]",

    "no variation is detected , while the sensitivity at 2@xmath46 on the @xmath2 variation is @xmath47/@xmath2 @xmath06.7 10@xmath48 , and on the mass ratio @xmath491.4 10@xmath29 over half of the age of the universe ( kanekar et al 2005 ) .",
    "it is then needed to find much more sources with alma .",
    "the number of molecular absorptions so far ( 5 at high - z ) and also the number of hi-21 cm absorbers ( about 50 for z@xmath240.1 ) is surprisingly low .",
    "why so few radio absorbers ?",
    "one explanation , at least for the molecular absorptions , is that the high column density expected obscures the background quasars , introducing a strong bias against the optical detection of these remote sources .",
    "at least some could be known only in radio , but with no redshift available .",
    "curran et al ( 2006 ) have noticed a strong correlation between the molecular fraction and the red colors of the quasars .",
    "those with molecular absorptions are in general compact flat spectrum sources , where most of the emission is covered .",
    "future searches should concentrate on sub - dla systems , where the h@xmath10 fraction is higher , as well as metals ( khare et al 2006 , kulkarni et al 2006 ) .",
    "typical first projects with alma could be ( included in the drsp ) : * 1 * molecular survey of pks1413 , pks1830 , cena , in 7 wide priority bands , with spectral resolution of 1 - 4 km / s ; * 2 * search for new systems , towards 60 selected radio loud agns with mm cont flux @xmath24 50mjy , with criteria of obscuration , gravitational lensing and/or suppressed soft x - ray flux . when no redshift is known",
    ", the search could be over the entire redshift range using the technique of frequency scanning .    as shown in figure 3 ,",
    "it is now well - known that the volumic density of radio quasars peaked around z=2 ( shaver et al , 1996 , wall et al 2005 ) , and there is a cutoff after z=3 .",
    "optical quasars follow the same curve , in a similar way to the star formation history . in parallel , the number of sources as a function of flux n(s ) increases well above the euclidean curve in s@xmath50 , and we could expect to detect 1 or 2 orders of magnitude more quasars with alma .",
    "however at high - z , their millimeter flux is weakened by the non - favorable k - correction ( compact and flat - spectrum sources being rare ) . in this domain , it is interesting to search 3 mm systems at cm wavelengths , with band 1 and 2 of alma in the future .",
