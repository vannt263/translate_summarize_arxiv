    "the poisson  boltzmann equation is the main tool for studying the behavior of ionic solutions @xcite .",
    "its main advantages are its simplicity , which allows for analytical solutions in simple cases , and its surprisingly good agreement with experiments .",
    "aqueous solutions of small and macro - ions are of interest from an industrial point of view ( _ e.g. , _",
    "colloidal suspensions @xcite ) and as an important component in biological systems ( _ e.g. , _ dna , charged membranes ) .",
    "therefore , the poisson ",
    "boltzmann approach was applied to many situations .",
    "of particular interest are : ( i ) adsorption of ions to flat surfaces @xcite ; ( ii ) ion distribution around a charge cylinder and the so - called _ manning condensation _",
    "@xcite ; and ( iii ) ion distribution around a charged sphere and the so - called _ charge renormalization _ @xcite .    in its simpler form",
    ", the linearized poisson - boltzmann equation leads to the debye  hckel expression , thus providing a simple description of screening effects in terms of the debye ",
    "hckel screening length @xcite .",
    "the success of the poisson ",
    "boltzmann approach is quite impressive in view of the various approximations which are included in its derivation : it is a mean field approach which totally neglects correlations and all specific ( non - electrostatic ) interactions between the ions including the ionic finite size .",
    "nevertheless , despite its success in describing a wide range of systems , it has been known for a long time to have some limitations in several cases : ( i ) the phase transition of electrolyte solutions @xcite , ( ii ) the adsorption of charged ions to highly charged surfaces @xcite , and ( iii ) the attractive interactions which can be observed between equally charged surfaces in the presence of asymmetric electrolytes @xcite .",
    "consequently , there have been numerous attempts to improve upon the standard poisson - boltzmann approach @xcite .    in this study",
    "we focus on the second case , where highly charged surfaces attract a large amount of free ions from the solution . at high ion densities",
    "achieved close to the surface , short range ion  ion interactions become comparable to the coulomb interaction and they can no longer be neglected . in particular , the ion density is bounded by the maximum value which is obtained when the ions are closely packed .",
    "recently , cuvillier et al .",
    "@xcite have provided an experimental setup which clearly demonstrates this situation . in their experiments",
    "large tungstic acid ions ( diameter of about 10 ) were adsorbed onto a charged monolayer spread at the air / water interface ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rondelez ] ) .",
    "the insoluble ( langmuir ) monolayer consists of charged amphiphilic molecules having two moieties : a charged head group favoring the water side of the interface , and a hydrocarbon tail favoring the air side .",
    "the surface charge density can be controlled continuously by changing the monolayer density through a lateral surface pressure . in the experiments , a large discrepancy was found between the measured ion concentration near the surface and the high values anticipated by the poisson ",
    "boltzmann approach .",
    "our aim in this study is to include the finite size of the ions in the poisson ",
    "boltzmann approach and study how the ion distribution close to charged surfaces is affected .",
    "the standard way of including the finite size of the ions in the poisson ",
    "boltzmann approach is to define a narrow layer close to the surface as impenetrable to the ions .",
    "this layer is usually referred to as the _ stern layer _ @xcite and its width is equal to the ion radius . outside this layer the regular poisson ",
    "boltzmann equation is implemented . in our approach , a modified poisson ",
    "boltzmann equation is derived where the steric forces lead to saturation of the ion density at high potentials .",
    "this way , the width of the saturated layer depends also on the surface charge and is not limited a - priori to only one counterion layer .    in the next section the modified pb equation",
    "is derived for different combinations of ion valencies .",
    "two derivations are presented : first , a systematic path integral approach where the ions are put on a discrete lattice , and second , a phenomenological free energy formulation where the excluded volume effect is added through the entropy of the solvent .",
    "this equation is then implemented in sec . 3 to study the adsorption of large ions to flat surfaces .",
    "consider an aqueous solution of charged ions .",
    "for simplicity we will assume that both co - ions and counter - ions have the same size @xmath0 .",
    "this assumption can be justified when all the surface charges are of the same sign , since only counterions are then attracted to the surface and reach high charge densities .",
    "another simplification is that we do not distinguish between the counterions which dissociate from the charged surfaces and the ones originating from the added salt .    for the valencies of the ions we will consider three cases : ( i ) a symmetric @xmath1:@xmath1 electrolyte , ( ii ) an asymmetric @xmath2:@xmath1 electrolyte , and ( iii ) @xmath1-valent counterions without additional salt .",
    "the different cases will be used to study the application of the modified equation in different physical systems .    for a symmetric @xmath1:@xmath1 electrolyte",
    "the solution contains two charge carriers , with charges equal to @xmath3 . in order to derive the free energy",
    "we will use a discrete lattice gas formulation . in this approach ,",
    "the charge carriers are placed on a three dimensional cubic lattice where the dimensions of a single cell are @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] ) .",
    "thus , by dividing space into discrete cells ( lattice sites ) and limiting the occupation of each cell to a single ion we introduce a short range repulsion between the ions .",
    "the size of a cell represents the volume of an ion up to a numerical prefactor . in order to describe the occupation of cells by ions we assign to each cell @xmath5 , which is located at @xmath6 , a spin - like variable @xmath7 .",
    "this variable can have one of three values : @xmath8 if the cell is empty ( occupied by a water molecule ) , and @xmath9 according to the sign of the ion that occupies the cell . the partition function of the system can now be written in the form @xcite @xmath10 the first term in the exponent is the electrostatic energy , where @xmath11 is the coulomb interaction .",

    "similar ionic distributions can be also obtained for solid electrolytes @xcite .",
    "this approach deviates significantly from the original pb equation for large electrostatic potentials @xmath66 .",

    "the effect of the additional entropy term and the fact that it limits the concentration of ions near the surface can be demonstrated by the following simple argument : consider a nearly saturated region near a highly charged ( positive ) surface where @xmath71 . on one hand , the system can gain entropy by pushing solvent molecules in between the positive ions .",
    "on the other hand , diluting the saturated layer costs electrostatic energy . altogether",

    "the balance between these two terms results in an optimal non - zero dilution equal to @xmath75 and the free energy gain due to this dilution is @xmath76 we conclude that entropy will always drive solvent molecules into the saturated layer , although at high surface charge densities their amount becomes exponentially small .",
    "the modified pb equation can help to interpret the adsorption experiments of cuvillier et al .",

    "<S> , the same equation can be derived by including the entropy of the solvent molecules in the free energy . in order to visualize the effect of the steric repulsion , a simple case of a single , highly charged , flat surface is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> this situation resembles recent adsorption experiments of large ions onto a charged monolayer . </S>",
    "<S> a simple criterion for the importance of the steric effects is expressed in terms of the surface charge density and the size of the ions . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that when these effects are important a saturated layer is formed near the surface . </S>",
