    ", a head / master node ( i.e. , a base station that serves as a gateway between wired and wireless networks and a center for fusion of data from distributed sensors ) is equipped with a powerful processor and supplied power from outlet , while sensor / slave nodes ( i.e. , nodes measuring data with sensors and connected to a wsn only through wireless channels ) are limited in processing and battery - powered .",
    "it is this _ asymmetry _ that our study focuses on ; unlike most existing schemes trying to save the power of all network nodes ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) , we concentrate on battery - powered sensor nodes , which are many in number , in minimizing energy consumption for time synchronization .    in this paper we mean by _ time synchronization _ a process of establishing a common time frame with which the nodes in a network can operate one another , whether their clocks are synchronized or not . by",
    "_ clock synchronization _",
    ", on the other hand , we mean a process of synchronizing each node clock to that of a common reference node , typically through a logical clock that is a function of a physical clock , which is one way of achieving time synchronization .",
    "note that without synchronizing node clocks , we can still provide a common time frame for the operation of network nodes .",
    "for instance , in multi - hop extension of the reference broadcast synchronization ( rbs ) algorithm @xcite , there are multiple broadcast domains independently maintaining their own clocks . in this case",
    ", the common time frame among multiple broadcast domains is provided through time conversion at gateway nodes belonging to neighboring domains .    in the literature ,",
    "time synchronization is formulated as the problem of estimating clock parameters , often including node distances , in a pairwise ( distributed ) or a network - wide ( global ) manner @xcite .",
    "few works , however , have focused on the mode of operation ( i.e. , time vs. clock synchronization discussed above ) and the way of implementation related with energy efficiency . to achieve better performance , several joint estimation algorithms for both clock parameters and pair - wise distances have been proposed ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "most of them are , however , based on centralized and global offline algorithms , and the estimation of parameters and the way of implementing clock / time synchronization together with the delivery of the results of estimation are not explicitly discussed . while joint estimation algorithms usually assume that all sensor nodes are available in the beginning , recursive and online operation of synchronization schemes are critical for wsn applications because there are nodes who join later or resume their operations in the middle .",
    "in this paper we present an energy - efficient time synchronization scheme based on asynchronous source clock frequency recovery ( scfr ) @xcite and _ reverse _ two - way message exchanges combined with measuring data report messages , where we minimize the number of message transmissions and receptions at sensor nodes , especially the number of message transmissions noting that the energy for message transmission is typically higher than that for message reception @xcite . in the proposed time synchronization scheme ,",
    "only the frequency of a sensor node clock is synchronized to that of the reference clock at the head node , but not its clock offset ; the proposed scheme is based on the idea of the separation of the clock frequency estimation / compensation at sensor nodes and the clock offset and delay estimation at the head node . for the clock frequency recovery",
    ", each sensor node passively listens to any messages with timestamps either broadcasted ( e.g. , beacons ) or unicasted ( e.g. , control messages to a specific node ) from the head node and carries out asynchronous source clock frequency recovery described in @xcite , which is basically one - way clock frequency estimation . for the clock",
    "offset and delay estimation , a simple two - way message exchange procedure @xcite is used but in a reverse direction where the head node initiates the procedure and keeps track of the offsets between its reference clock and sensor node clocks ; also , instead of dedicated , periodical synchronization message exchanges , we embed the synchronization `` response '' messages of the two - way message exchange procedure in the measurement data report messages from sensor nodes in order to minimize the number of message transmissions . in this way we can move most of time synchronization operations to the head node and reduce the complexity and thereby power consumption of sensor nodes for time synchronization . to carry out usual wsn operations with the proposed time synchronization scheme",
    ", the head node translates timestamp values based on clock offset information before transmitting control messages to sensor nodes .",
    "the major contributions of this work are three - fold : first , it provides a new energy - efficient time synchronization scheme for asymmetric wsns to minimize the number of two - way message exchanges by cleverly combining one - way clock skew estimation / compensation and reverse two - way message exchanges .",
    "note that the two - way message exchanges can not be avoided in estimating both clock offset and clock skew because it is impossible to separate the effects of clock offset and propagation delay with one - way message exchanges alone @xcite .",
    "the proposed scheme does not only minimize the number of two - way message exchanges but also enable the use of simple , low - complexity one - way clock skew estimation / compensation algorithms to avoid the high complexity of advanced estimation algorithms taking into nuisance parameters like mean and variance of the propagation delay .",
    "secondly , we formally describe the operations of and analyze the time synchronization performance of the proposed scheme : by separately modeling times of a hardware clock and a logical clock at a network node , we can capture the dynamic nature of the proposed time synchronization scheme in the analysis , which estimates clock parameters of a counterpart and updates its own logical clock recursively .",
    "thirdly , we also analyze the performance of measurement time estimation based on both conventional and reverse two - way message exchanges . as for clock",
    "skew estimation / compensation , we carry out a comparative analysis of the performance of one - way and two - way maximum likelihood ( ml ) and ml - like estimators and derive cramr - rao lower bounds and lower bounds for ml and ml - like estimators , respectively .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : energy - effic - time ] , we describe the proposed time synchronization scheme with hardware and logical clock models ; we also analyze the effect of clock skew on measurement time estimation in both conventional and reverse two - way message exchanges , present joint ml and ml - like one - way clock skew estimators with their performance bounds , and discuss an extension to multi - hop time synchronization through gateway nodes .",
    "section  [ sec : simulation - results ] presents the results of simulations for a comparative analysis of the performance of one - way and two - way clock skew estimators for asynchronous scfr and the investigation of the time synchronization performance and the energy efficiency of the proposed scheme compared to the schemes based on conventional two - way message exchanges with and without scfr .",
    "section  [ sec : comp - relat - work ] reviews the related work in comparison to our work before concluding this paper in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the major idea of the proposed scheme is to allow independent , unsynchronized slave clocks at sensor nodes but running at the same frequency as the reference clock at a head node through the asynchronous scfr described in @xcite , which needs only the reception of messages with timestamps at sensor nodes .",
    "the clock offset , on the other hand , is estimated at the head node based on the reverse two - way message exchanges .",
    "[ fig : proposed_scheme_overview ] illustrates this idea in comparison to conventional two - way message exchanges .",
    "+ ( a ) +   + ( b )    first , the proposed scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : proposed_scheme_overview ]  ( b ) does not have periodic , dedicated two - way message exchanges with synchronization messages like `` request '' and `` response '' shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : proposed_scheme_overview ]  ( a ) ; instead , the `` request '' and `` response '' messages are embedded in the most recent timestamped message  either broadcasted or unicasted to a specific node  from the head node and a measurement data report message from a sensor node , respectively .",
    "when there are no strict timing requirements for the processing of measurement data , the measurement data and their corresponding timestamps can be optionally bundled together in a `` report / response '' message , whose payload structure is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : payload_structure ] , in order to further reduce the number of message transmissions ; in this case the clock offset estimated based on the timestamp of the last measurement data # n is collectively applied to all bundled measurement data in estimating their occurrences with respect to the reference clock at the head node .",
    "secondly , the direction of two - way message exchanges of the proposed scheme is reversed , i.e. , it is the master ( i.e. , the head node ) that sends the `` request '' messages , not the slave ( i.e. , the sensor node ) , unlike the conventional two - way messages exchanges ; as a result , the master knows the current status of the slave clock , but the slave does not .",
    "so the information of slave clocks ( i.e. , clock offsets with respect to the reference clock ) is centrally managed at the head node .    for operations like coordinated sleep wake - up node scheduling , before sending a control message , the head node first adjusts the time for future operation based on the clock offset of the recipient sensor node . in this way , even though sensor nodes in the network have clocks with different clock offsets , their operations can be coordinated based on the common reference clock at the head node .",
    "we consider an asymmetric wsn where one head ( master ) node and @xmath0 sensor ( slave ) nodes all equipped with independent hardware clocks based on quartz crystal oscillators .",
    "for simplicity , we take time @xmath1 of the head node clock as a global reference and describe times of slave hardware clocks as functions of @xmath1 .",
    "we use the first - order affine clock model @xcite to describe time @xmath2 of the hardware clock at the @xmath3th sensor node as follows : for @xmath4 $ ] , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are clock frequency ratio and clock offset , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath8 is called a clock skew in the literature , which is defined as a _ normalized clock frequency difference _ between hardware clocks , and its typical value for clocks based on quartz crystal oscillators is of the order of tens of ppm ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) .",
    "wsn operations at a sensor node is based on a logical clock , whose time is again a function of the time of its physical clock and takes into account the adjustments by an adopted time synchronization scheme ( e.g. , offset adjustment by two - way message exchanges and frequency adjustment by scfr ) .",
    "specifically , time @xmath10 of the logical clock at the @xmath3th sensor node can be modeled as a piecewise linear function as follows : for @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the reference time when a @xmath15th synchronization occurs , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the estimated clock skew and offset from the @xmath15th synchronization .",
    "if the synchronization is only for frequency , we set @xmath17 to 0 in ; if the synchronization is only for offset , on the other hand , we set @xmath16 to 0 in . it should be noted that @xmath10 in is the function of @xmath18 , but not @xmath1 itself , because the reference time @xmath1 is not known at a sensor node and the only available time is from a local hardware clock ( i.e. , @xmath18 ) .",
    "here we compare the effect of clock skew on the measurement time estimation in both conventional and reverse two - way message exchange procedures by an approximate analysis of the best - case performance under a deterministic delay ( i.e. , no random component ) and no bundled measurements .",

    "[ fig : timing_diagrams ]  ( b ) , because the `` request '' message of the reverse two - way message exchanges is embedded in the measurement data `` report '' message from a sensor node as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : payload_structure ] , there is no time difference between the measurement time and the end of two - way message exchange ( i.e. , @xmath28 ) . in this case",
    "the two - way message exchange procedure is the only source of error , i.e. , @xmath29 again , if @xmath24 , the measurement time estimation error can be approximated as @xmath30    from and , we can see that , when being isolated from the effect of random component of delay , the proposed scheme can reduce the effect of clock skew on the measurement time estimation error by a factor of two for @xmath24 . because the time difference @xmath19 between the reception of the last beacon ( or any timestamped message ) from the head node and the measurement occurrence at the sensor node can be a larger value in practice , however , it is still important to compensate the clock skew at sensor nodes in the proposed scheme .",
    "one of the essential components of the proposed time synchronization scheme is the recovery of the reference clock frequency at sensor nodes based on one - way message dissemination from the head node .",
    "once we estimate the clock skew @xmath8 in , the reference clock frequency can be recovered through the clock skew compensation of the logical clock model in .    in case of two - way message exchanges , both joint ml estimation of clock offset and",

    "<S> we consider energy - efficient time synchronization in a wireless sensor network where a head node ( i.e. , a gateway between wired and wireless networks and a center of data fusion ) is equipped with a powerful processor and supplied power from outlet , and sensor nodes ( i.e. , nodes measuring data and connected only through wireless channels ) are limited in processing and battery - powered . </S>",
    "<S> it is this _ asymmetry _ that our study focuses on ; unlike most existing schemes to save the power of all network nodes , we concentrate on battery - powered sensor nodes in minimizing energy consumption for time synchronization . </S>",
    "<S> we present a time synchronization scheme based on asynchronous source clock frequency recovery and reverse two - way message exchanges combined with measurement data report messages , where we minimize the number of message transmissions from sensor nodes , and carry out the performance analysis of the estimation of both measurement time and clock frequency with lower bounds for the latter . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results verify that the proposed scheme outperforms the schemes based on conventional two - way message exchanges with and without clock frequency recovery in terms of the accuracy of measurement time estimation and the number of message transmissions and receptions at sensor nodes as an indirect measure of energy efficiency .    </S>",
