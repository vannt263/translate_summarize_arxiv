    "low temperature expansions for the spin-1 ising model were first obtained by fox and guttmann ( 1973 ) , who gave a 26 term series for the square lattice , of which only the first 24 terms were correct .",
    "the method used to obtain the series was a generalisation of the code method of sykes  ( 1965 ) .",
    "series on other lattices , both two- and three - dimensional were also obtained .",
    "subsequently the finite lattice method of series expansions ( de neef , 1975 ; de neef and enting , 1977 ) has proved to be an extremely powerful technique for deriving series expansions for a range of two - dimensional models .",
    "the formalism is applicable in higher dimensions but the technique becomes progressively less efficient ( guttmann and enting , 1993 ) .",
    "adler and enting ( 1984 ) used the finite lattice method to extend low temperature expansions for the zero - field partition function , the magnetisation and the zero - field susceptibility of the spin-1 ising model to order @xmath2 .",
    "as we have noted elsewhere , developments in computing over the last decade , notably faster computers with more memory , have allowed larger finite lattice calculations to be made . by re - running the program used by adler and enting we easily extended the series to 65 terms .",
    "we have , however , recently implemented a revised algorithm that removes much of the memory - size requirement that has previously limited our finite - lattice calculations .",
    "this involves using two different ways of calculating finite lattice partition functions .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the formalism was given by enting ( 1990 ) .",
    "in this paper we use this new formalism to calculate low - temperature spin-1 ising series to order @xmath3 . using a rather cumbersome correction method described in the appendix we also obtained the coefficients of @xmath4 .",
    "we have also substantially extended the spin-@xmath0 low - temperature susceptibility series .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we describe the finite lattice method of series expansions .",
    "the various expansions are detailed in section 3 .",
    "the results of the series analysis , with the emphasis on the new extended spin-1 series , are presented in section 4 .",
    "finally , section 5 contains a short summary and discussion of our results .",
    "as in the study by adler and enting ( 1984 ) , the series expansions are derived from @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the infinite lattice partition function and the @xmath7 are the partition functions of the @xmath8 lattices .",
    "the weights , @xmath9 are derived from the expressions given by enting ( 1978 ) , modified to exploit the rotational symmetry of the lattice . the difference from enting and adler is that we use a larger cut - off , @xmath10 , which leads to longer series .",
    "the finite lattice method relies on efficient techniques for evaluating the @xmath7 .",
    "we use what are known as ` transfer matrix ' techniques",
    ". these work by moving a boundary through the lattice and constructing a partial sum of boltzmann weights for each possible configuration of the boundary .",
    "the traditional form of transfer matrix calculation involves moving the boundary one column at a time . for a system with @xmath11 states per site ,",
    "evaluating @xmath7 involves @xmath12 iterations of @xmath13 operations on series .",
    "it is more efficient to move the boundary by adding one site at a time .",
    "evaluating @xmath7 involves @xmath14 iterations of @xmath15 series operations .",
    "the ` one - site - at - a - time ' algorithm seems to have been rediscovered independently a number of times .",
    "our use of the technique derives from unpublished work by r.j .",
    "baxter .",
    "the new procedure proposed by enting ( 1990 ) and adopted here is to use ( 2.1 ) as before but to use two different techniques for calculating the @xmath7 .",
    "we define a cut - off parameter @xmath16 so that , for a @xmath11-state system , the maximum vector size is @xmath17 . in evaluating @xmath7 ( and considering only @xmath18 because of our use of symmetry ) , if @xmath19 we use our original procedure of building up the lattice column by column with each column built up one site at a time .",
    "evaluating @xmath7 requires @xmath20 series operations but the evaluation of @xmath7 enables us to determine @xmath21 for @xmath22 with little extra computation . for square ( or nearly square ) lattices we evaluate the partition functions by a technique in which the boundary pivots about a central point .",
    "the general principle is based on unpublished work by r.j .",
    "baxter .",
    "the ` pivoting ' transfer matrix approach use 3 integers , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) to specify the rectangles .",
    "the rectangles are of size @xmath28 by @xmath29 .",
    "we refer to sites by integer coordinates @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the partition function is a sum over the @xmath33 conditional lattice sums in which the @xmath23 sites @xmath34 with @xmath35 are fixed .",
    "transfer matrix techniques are used to calculate the lattice sum conditional on the state of the fixed sites .",
    "the algorithm outlined below requires space for @xmath36 series and takes time @xmath37 .",
    "we consider two alternative forms of ` cut - off '    _ space - limited : _ if the execution time was not limiting then the smallest rectangle that could not be computed by pivoting would be the square of size @xmath38 .",
    "thus we use @xmath39 we use the original transfer matrix technique for @xmath19 and use the pivoting algorithm for rectangles of size @xmath40 by @xmath41 for @xmath24 , @xmath42 . for @xmath43",
    "the longest rectangle is of length @xmath44 , so that in terms of the cut - off , @xmath10 the time requirement grows as @xmath45 .",
    "_ time - limited : _ if we wish to restrict the growth in the time requirement to the @xmath46 that applies to our original technique , then we use the cut - off @xmath47 again we use our original technique for @xmath19 and use the pivoting algorithm for rectangles of size @xmath48 by @xmath49 for @xmath50 from @xmath51 to @xmath52    in the work presented here we have used the ` time - limited ' form . the algorithm for evaluating finite lattices by ` pivoting ' is    * for each of the @xmath53 states of the fixed line ( the filled circles in ): * * construct the conditional lattice sum .",

    "another new feature of our calculations is the choice of a machine ( cray ymp  el ) which emphasises processing speed rather than large memory .",
    "the fact that most of our basic operations in the transfer matrix approach are actually operations on truncated series means that we can readily utilise the vector capabilities of such a machine by ensuring that the series operations are performed in vector mode .",
    "we note that the pivoting algorithm also permits a high degree of parallel operation since each of the sums for a given centre line can be evaluated independently of the others .    in order to deal with the large integer coefficients in the series",
    "the calculations were performed using modular arithmetic ( see , e.g. , knuth 1969 ) .",
    "utilising the standard 46-bit integers of the cray we used the set of primes , @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",

    "the number of terms derived correctly with the finite lattice method is given by the power of the lowest - order connected graph not contained in any of the rectangles considered .",
    "since we are using the _ time - limited _ cut - off the simplest such graphs are chains of @xmath96 sites all in the 0 state . from the spin-1 hamiltonian",
    "we see that such chains give rise to terms @xmath97 .",
    "the series are thus correct to order @xmath98 .",
    "we have checked this explicitly by calculating the series for @xmath99 and checking that the terms through @xmath100 agree with the final 79-term series derived using @xmath70 .",
    "an additional spin-1 coefficient was calculated by a correction procedure explained in the appendix .",
    "these new series are significant extensions to the hitherto longest series ( 45 terms ) due to adler and enting ( 1984 ) .    by the same methods _ mutatis mutandis _ , we calculated , with @xmath101 , a new 78-term series for the spin-@xmath0 ising model in the low - temperature expansion variable @xmath102 .",

    "the spin-@xmath0 magnetisation and specific heat series are of course known exactly , so only the susceptibility series is new .",
    "we nevertheless list the coefficients of all three quantities , partly for completeness and partly for verification of our algorithm .",

    "one of the major differences between the two models appears to be that the non - analytic confluent terms are nt present in the spin-@xmath0 model ( the @xmath112 s equal zero ) .",
    "the low - temperature spin-1 series is ill - behaved because there are non - physical singularities closer to the origin than the physical singularity , thus rendering ratio methods useless .",
    "the series may still be analyzed using differential approximants ( guttmann 1989 ) , which provides an effective analytic continuation beyond the radius of convergence , thus allowing accurate estimation of critical parameters even when the dominant singularity is non - physical .",
    "it is also often useful to change the series variable by a transformation leading to a new series in which the singularity closest to the origin is the physical one .",
    "however , such singularity - moving transformations may introduce long - period oscillations ( guttmann 1989 ) seriously impairing the accuracy of ratio methods .",
    "it turns out that ordinary dlog pad approximants , equivalent to first order homogeneous differential approximants , works best for the magnetisation series . by averaging over several [ n / m ]",
    "approximants with @xmath114 using at least 65 terms of the series ( @xmath115 ) we find the following estimates for the critical point @xmath116 and exponent @xmath117 . the number in parenthesis is the error in the last digit(s ) given as three standard deviations .",
    "we find that approximants using fewer than @xmath118 terms deviate systematically from these averages . in",
    "we have plotted the estimates for @xmath119 _ vs _ the number of terms ( @xmath120 ) from the series utilized in the dlog pad approximants .",
    "we clearly see how the @xmath119-estimates settle down to a plateau around @xmath121 when more than 60 terms are used .",
    "the estimate for @xmath119 is slightly higher than the expected exact value @xmath122 .",
    "in addition to the physical singularity at @xmath113 , we find that the magnetisation series has a singularity on the negative @xmath80-axis at @xmath123 with exponent @xmath124 and a pair of complex roots at @xmath125 with exponent @xmath126 .",
    "note that the non - physical singularity @xmath127 is closer to the origin than the physical singularity @xmath113 .",
    "first order _ inhomogeneous _ and second order differential approximants do not work very well for the magnetisation series , as evidenced by error estimates which are generally at least an order of magnitude larger than in the simple dlog pad case .",
    "if we assume that the exact value of @xmath122 we have to change our estimate of @xmath113 .",
    "we find basically a linear relationship between the estimates for @xmath119 and @xmath113 , and for @xmath109 we find @xmath128 .",
    "we have obtained a very similar result by analyzing the series for @xmath129 using ordinary ( _ not _ dlog ) pad approximants . raising the magnetisation series to the 8th power and looking for simple zeros and poles of",
    "the resulting series obviously corresponds to biasing the magnetisation series to have a leading critical exponent of @xmath130 .",
    "we find that the function given by this series has zeroes at @xmath131 and @xmath132 plus a conjugate pair of simple poles at @xmath133 . for comparison",
    "we note that the spontaneous magnetisation of the quadratic spin-@xmath0 ising model is given by the formula ( onsager 1944 , yang 1952 )    @xmath134^{1/4},\\ ] ]    from which we see that the magnetisation have singularities with exponent @xmath130 at @xmath135 and @xmath136 , with exponent @xmath137 at @xmath138 and finally with exponent @xmath139 at @xmath140 .",
    "the success of ordinary dlog pad approximants in analyzing the magnetisation series stems from the absence of analytic background terms .",
    "in the susceptibility and specific heat series such background terms are indeed present and obscure the leading critical behaviour . however , inhomogeneous differential approximants are generally successful in dealing with such terms . in",
    "we have listed the estimates for @xmath141 and @xmath113 obtained by averaging many different approximants to the susceptibility series .",
    "we find that ordinary dlog pad approximants ( the first order approximants with @xmath142 ) yield quite stable estimates but that the estimate for @xmath113 is quite a bit larger than for the magnetisation , and that @xmath141 is markedly larger than the expected exact value @xmath110 .",
    "however , once the order of the inhomogeneous polynomial is larger than 2 , the estimates for @xmath141 becomes fully consistent with the expected behaviour , indeed we see that the first order approximants favor a value a little larger than @xmath143 whereas the second order approximants favor a value slightly below @xmath143 .",
    "taken together there seems little doubt the exact value indeed is @xmath110 . again assuming a linear relationship between @xmath141 and @xmath113 , we find that @xmath144 .",
    "the estimates for the critical exponent @xmath141 exhibit the same trend as those for @xmath119 , i.e. , when fewer than @xmath118 terms are used the estimates are generally clearly @xmath145 with larger deviations when fewer terms is involved in estimating @xmath141 .",
    "when more than 60 terms are used , the estimates reach a plateau around a value @xmath146 , but with a spread that clearly includes the expected exact value @xmath110 . in this case",
    "we find additional singularities at @xmath147 with exponent @xmath148 and @xmath149 with an exponent of @xmath150 . a closer examination of the various approximants revealed that as the estimates of @xmath151 approach the value found from the magnetisation series , @xmath152 , the exponent approaches @xmath153 .",
    "it is thus very likely that the exponents at @xmath113 and @xmath151 are equal .",
    "the analytic background term is stronger in the specific heat series as can be seen in  where we have listed the estimates for @xmath154 and @xmath113 . the first order approximants yield no useful results with @xmath155 . once the order of the inhomogeneous polynomial becomes larger than 3 the first order approximants clearly yield an estimate consistent with @xmath111 .",
    "this time a linear relationship between @xmath154 and @xmath113 indicates @xmath156 when @xmath157 .",
    "in addition we find a pair of complex roots at @xmath158 with an exponent ( divergence ) of @xmath159 .",
    "these conclusions are fully confirmed by the results of the analysis using second order differential approximants .",
    "there is also evidence for a singularity at @xmath160 , but as can be seen from the size of the error esimate it is not well - defined .",
    "this is also reflected in the estimates of the associated exponent , ranging from 0.5 to -0.5 , with values close to zero when @xmath161 .",
    "this could indicate a logarithmic singularity at @xmath151 , though the evidence is very weak",
    ". a stronger case can be made by looking at the series for the derivative of the specific heat , d@xmath162/d@xmath80 , which should have simple poles at @xmath113 and @xmath151 if @xmath162 has logarithmic singularities at these points .",
    "a dlog pad analysis of the series revealed singularities at @xmath163 with exponent @xmath164 , at @xmath165 with exponent @xmath166 , and at @xmath167 with exponent @xmath168 .",
    "these results thus confirm the results from the analysis of the specific heat series itself .    the scaling law , @xmath169 ,",
    "is seen to hold at both the critical point @xmath113 and at the non - physical singularity @xmath151 . likewise , for the spin-@xmath0 ising model this scaling law holds at the sigularities @xmath135 since @xmath157 , @xmath109 , and @xmath170 in both cases . at the other non - physical singularity @xmath127",
    "we find @xmath171 for the spin-1 model . from the exact solutions for the zero - field partition function and spontaneous magnetisation of the spin-@xmath0 ising model it follows that @xmath157 and @xmath172 at @xmath173 .",
    "a differential approximant analysis of the susceptibility series yields the estimate @xmath174 at @xmath127 .",
    "so for the spin-@xmath0 we find , at @xmath127 , that @xmath175 .",
    "it seems highly likely that @xmath169 holds at all the non - physical singularities .",
    "this would mean that the exponent corresponding to @xmath141 at @xmath176 for the spin-@xmath0 ising model would be @xmath177 exactly . for the spin-1 ising model",
    "the situation is less clear . at @xmath178 ,",
    "the analogue of @xmath154 is 1.172 , and the analogue of @xmath141 is 1.175 .",
    "it is possible that they are both @xmath179 exactly , or that one is 1 and the other is @xmath180 .",
    "we have not been able to make these results more precise .",
    "as mentioned above ratio methods are of use only if one can find a transformation that maps the non - physical singularity outside the transformed physical disc .",
    "one such transformation is given by @xmath181 , which leads to a new ( high - temperature like ) expansion variable , @xmath182 . among the various extrapolation methods ( guttmann 1989 ) we find that the best over - all convergence is obtained from the neville - aitkin table . from the magnetisation and susceptibility series",
    "we obtain the estimates @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "the exponent estimates are from biased approximants using the accurate value @xmath186 obtained from the differential approximant analysis . while this type of analysis yields estimates of lesser accuracy than the analysis based on differential approximants it is nevertheless reassuring that the two methods are in agreement .",
    "other extrapolation methods generally yield similar though less accurate estimates .",
    "the major source of error in all the methods is the presence of long - period oscillations in the extrapolations .",
    "we have calculated the critical amplitudes using two different methods , both of which are very simple and easy to implement . in the first method , we note that if @xmath187 , then it follows that @xmath188 .",
    "so we simply form the series for @xmath189 and evaluate pad approximants to this series at @xmath113 .",
    "the result is just @xmath190 .",
    "this procedure works well for the magnetisation and susceptibility series ( it obviously can not be used to analyse the specific heat series ) . for the magnetisation",
    "we find that the spread of various approximants is minimal at @xmath191 where @xmath192 .",
    "allowing for a value of @xmath113 between 0.55406 and 0.55407 we find @xmath193 .",
    "a similar analysis for the susceptibility yields the closest agreement at @xmath194 with @xmath195 . again allowing for a wider choice in @xmath113 we find @xmath196 .    in the second method , proposed by liu and fisher ( 1989 ) ,",
    "one starts from @xmath197 and then forms the auxiliary function @xmath198 .",
    "thus the required amplitude is now the _ background _ term in @xmath199 , which can be obtained from inhomogeneous differential approximants ( guttmann ( 1989 ) p89 ) . in",
    "we have listed the estimates obtained by averaging over various first order differential approximants using at least 65 terms of the series with @xmath194 .",
    "the results for the magnetisation @xmath200 and the susceptibility @xmath201 agree with those obtained above , though the error estimates are much larger .",
    "these results are not seriously affected by allowing for a wider choice of @xmath113 .",
    "this method can also be used to study the specific heat series .",
    "one now starts from @xmath202 and then looks at the auxiliary function @xmath203 . as before the amplitude can be obtained as the background term in @xmath199 .",
    "the results of the analysis are listed in  from which we get the final estimate @xmath204 .",
    "jugding from the error estimates it would seem that the first method for calculating the amplitudes is superior to the second method .",
    "this apparent superiority does however not hold up under further scrutiny .",
    "we checked the two methods on the spin-@xmath0 susceptibility series where the leading amplitude has been calculated to high accuracy ( wu 1976 ) . in the widely accepted standard notation ( fisher 1967 ) , @xmath205",

    "since , @xmath212 , we find that @xmath213 . using the two methods to calculate @xmath214 we get the estimates @xmath215 from the first method and @xmath216 from the second method .",
    "this clearly shows that the smaller error estimate from the first method can not be taken too seriously as both estimates are only marginally consistent with the exact result .",

    "these conclusions are unaltered by looking at @xmath246 and 0.554070 though we note that by far the best agreement between different approximants is for @xmath194 .",
    "the results for the susceptibility series are listed in  for @xmath247 . in this case",
    "we again confirm the values of the leading critical exponent and critical amplitudes .",
    "the results for the confluent singularity is much more confusing as the [ n / n+1 ] approximants yields the estimate @xmath248 very different from the estimate @xmath249 obtained from the [ n+1/n ] approximants .",
    "the [ n / n ] approximants generally yield no estimates for this value of @xmath113 .",
    "however , at slightly higher values of @xmath113 , the [ n / n ] approximants also become useful , though they favor neither one nor the other of the @xmath240-estimates cited above .",
    "this is clearly seen in  where we have plotted the estimate for @xmath240 _ vs _ the parameter @xmath113 used in the baker - hunter transformation for various approximants with @xmath250 .",
    "the different approximants [ n / n+1 ] , [ n / n ] , and [ n+1/n ] clearly bunch together in three distinct classes .",
    "the [ n / n+1 ] approximants exhibit a narrow crossing at @xmath251 and @xmath252 whereas the [ n+1/n ] approximants cross at @xmath253 and @xmath254 and the [ n / n ] approximant though not intersecting mutually do seem to cross through both the above regions .",
    "note that the [ n / n ] approximants does nt yield any estimates below @xmath255 . from these results it is not possible to infer a final estimate for @xmath240 and we are unable to explain the very different behaviour exhibited by the various sets of approximants .",
    "the second method , due to adler ( 1981 ) , involves studying dlog pad approximants to the function @xmath256 , where @xmath257 the logarithmic derivative to @xmath256 has a pole at @xmath113 with residue @xmath258 , where @xmath259 is the leading critical exponent .",
    "we evaluate the dlog pad approximants for a range of guesses for @xmath113 and @xmath259 . for each such guess",
    "we thus find an estimate for @xmath240 ; for the correct value of @xmath113 and @xmath259 we should see a convergence region in the @xmath260-space . in practice we allways froze @xmath259 at its expected exact value and plotted @xmath240 as a function of @xmath113",
    ".   shows @xmath240 as a function of @xmath113 with @xmath122 using the spontaneous magnetisation series . in this figure",
    "we see a very narrow convergence region at @xmath261 and @xmath245 . in",
    "we have plotted similar results from an analysis of the susceptibility series with @xmath110 . in this case",
    "we find a narrow crossing region at @xmath262 and @xmath263 .",
    "the last method , also due to adler ( 1983 ) , is a generalisation of an approach devised by roskies ( 1981 ) to study the high - temperature susceptibility of the three - dimensional spin-@xmath0 ising model .",
    "the first step is to transform the series @xmath264 to ones in    @xmath265    where @xmath113 is assumed known but @xmath266 is a variable parameter .",
    "next one looks at different pad approximants to the function    @xmath267.\\ ] ]    for the correct guesses for @xmath113 and @xmath240 the various pad approximants should intersect and give a correct estimate for the leading critical exponent @xmath259 . in",
    "we have plotted the estimate for @xmath119 as a function of the transformation variable @xmath266 with @xmath194 using the spontaneous magnetisation series .",
    "a narrow crossing region is found at @xmath268 and @xmath269 .",
    "grt  shows a similar plot but for the susceptibility series ; in this case we locate the crossing at @xmath270 and @xmath271",
    ".    the value of the correction - to - scaling exponent of two - dimensional ising systems has been addressed by several authors .",
    "nienhuis ( 1982 ) has mapped the @xmath11-state potts model in two dimensions onto a model which is in the ising universality class ( when @xmath11 is set to 2 ) . in that case one",
    "obtains a value @xmath272 .",
    "barma and fisher ( 1985 ) obtained @xmath273 at the pure ising critical point of the klauder and double gaussian models .",
    "they point out that while this is inconsistent with the expectation of pure logarithmic corrections to scaling , it is possible for these logarithmic terms to have amplitudes that vanish on approach to the pure ising limit in such a way as to be describable by an apparent correction - to - scaling exponent @xmath274 .",
    "the various estimates we have obtained for the spin-1 model appear to be entirely consistent with this complex and subtle behaviour .",
    "in this work we have substantially extended the existing low - temperature series for the two - dimensional spin-1 ising model by introducing a new version of the finite lattice method which saves considerable space over previous implementations .",
    "the usefulness of such extended series is demonstrated by our analysis , in which we find that the correct results are clearly evident only after more than 60 terms in the series !    the analysis of the new spin-1 series provides us with an accurate estimate of the critical point , @xmath128 , where the error estimate is chosen rather conservatively , and reflects the descripancy between estimates obtained from the three series and using different methods of analysis .",
    "our value is in excellent agreement with a recent estimate @xmath275 obtained by lipowski and suzuki ( 1992 ) from a transfer - matrix version of the double cluster mean - field approximation , and also agrees with the estimate @xmath276 of blte and nightingale ( 1985 ) obtained by phenomenological renormalization using the correlation length of a @xmath277 systems calculated with transfer matrix techniques .",
    "however , our results and those mentioned above , clearly rule out a recent conjecture @xmath278 by urumov ( 1988 ) for the _ exact _ value of the critical point obtained from a generalisation of a method proposed by vraki ( 1980 ) to calculate the exactly known equations for the critical temperature of the spin-@xmath0 ising model on a chequerboard lattice .",
    "the evidence for the leading critical exponents clearly show that the spin-1 ising model belongs to the usual ising universality class , a point also supported strongly by the results of blte and nightingale ( 1985 ) , i.e. , the critical exponents take the values @xmath109 , @xmath170 , and @xmath111 , exactly .",
    "in addition we find a non - analytic confluent correction with an exponent @xmath279 .",
    "generally the magnetisation series favors a value of @xmath280 whereas the susceptibility series yields estimates @xmath281 .",
    "one notable exception is the [ n+1/n ] approximants to the baker - hunter transformed susceptibility series which leads to estimates @xmath282 . from field - theoretic arguments",
    "it is expected that the value of @xmath240 should be the same for both series .",
    "this leads us to the final estimate @xmath283 in good agreement with the result @xmath284 of adler and enting ( 1984 ) , but clearly smaller than the field - theoretic prediction @xmath285 ( le guillou and zinn - justin , 1980 ) , and the `` exact '' value @xmath272 found by nienhuis ( 1982 ) .",
    "the new finite lattic method is also directly generalisable to higher spin ising models , as well as to other two - dimensional systems .",
    "the extended series for the low - temperature susceptibility of the quadratic spin-@xmath0 ising model is in excellent agreement with the numerical predictions of gartenhaus and mccullough ( 1988 ) .",
    "our exact coefficients agree to all 7 predicted significant digits .",
    "we would like to thank michael e. fisher for helpful discussions on the question of correction - to - scaling exponents .",
    "financial support from the australian research council is gratefully acknowledged by ajg and ij .",
    "in section 2 we described how to obtain series expansions from the finite lattice method .",
    "we ran the program upto @xmath286 yielding a series correct through order @xmath3 . when running the program one may actually calculate the truncated series in @xmath80 to orders beyond that to which the series coefficients are correct .",
    "one would expect at least the first incorrect coefficient derived in this fashion to deviate only a little from the correct one . in this appendix",
    "we describe a correction procedure whereby we were able to obtain one additional correct term and thus extend the series to order @xmath4 .",
    "at first we just looked at the first correction term for @xmath287 , i.e. , the difference between the correct series coefficients and the first incorrect ones for a given value of @xmath16 , but were unable to find a pattern allowing us to guess the correction term for @xmath70 .",
    "next we reran the program deriving a series using @xmath288 hoping that the correction terms for the @xmath288 case were the same as those for the spin-1 model ( @xmath289 ) .",
    "it turns out that the correction terms is the two cases are almost identical . in",
    "we have listed the amount by which the @xmath288 correction terms fail to predict the spin-1 correction terms .",
    "one could thus obtain almost correct spin-1 correction terms for @xmath70 just using the @xmath288 correction term .",
    "however , we found that the numbers in  obey recursive relations .",
    "let @xmath290 , then we find the following recurrence relations for the @xmath266 s , in the case of the partition function      using these recurrence relations we find @xmath294 and thus using the @xmath288 correction terms for @xmath70 we can finally find the correction terms for the spin-1 model and thus the correct coefficient to @xmath4 .",
    "though the correction procedure is rather cumbersome it should be noted that the cpu - time required to calculate the truncated series with @xmath295 for @xmath289 and @xmath296 for @xmath288 is insignificant compared to the time it takes to run the program with @xmath70 and @xmath289 .",
