    "standard quantum theories consist of a hilbert space of states defined on spacelike surfaces and a unitary operator which evolves these states through time",
    ". the state may be the wave - function of a particle , as in non - relativistic quantum mechanics , or the quantum state of a matter field , as for quantum field theory .",
    "when we quantize gravity , we expect the spacetime metric , and therefore the causal structure of spacetime , to vary quantum mechanically .",
    "the metric may be in a mixed quantum state , not corresponding to any classical spacetime .",
    "it will therefore be impossible to define whether two points in the spacetime are spacelike , null , or timelike separated , or to define a spacelike surface .",
    "if we can not define states on spacelike surfaces , then we also lose any notion of the unitary evolution of these states .",
    "even if there exist regions of spacetime which are foliable by spacelike surfaces , we can not say that the operator which evolves states between two spacelike surfaces will be unitary",
    ".    given this , the current framework for quantum theory will not be sufficient to express a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "what is needed is a theory which can be expressed covariantly , without dependence on spacelike surfaces .",
    "one possibility is to follow feynman and use a sum - over - histories approach .",
    "the fundamental constituents of the theory are histories of alternatives , which are parameterized paths of the given system through its phase space .",
    "there is no concept of evolution , since there are no states to evolve .",
    "one may , however , be able to assign probabilities to the histories if the quantum interference between histories is negligible .",
    "if so , then we can calculate transition amplitudes between two different configurations of the system by computing a path integral over all possible histories between the two configurations  @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics also fails when applied to spacetime with closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) .",
    "these spacetimes are generally not foliable by spacelike surfaces .",
    "clearly the global causal structure breaks down due to the ctcs , and there may be both spacelike and timelike geodesics between two points in the spacetime . also , many authors  @xcite have shown in perturbation analyses that interacting theories exhibit non - unitary evolution through a region of ctcs .",
    "using quantum theory in a spacetime with ctcs one loses both the notion of a state on a spacelike surface and the unitary evolution of those states .",
    "these problems are similar to those discussed above which occur when trying to quantize gravity .",
    "thus , spacetimes with ctcs may be useful as models in the search for a quantum theory of gravity , since they provide simple examples of spacetimes where quantum mechanics breaks down due to the loss of causal structure .",
    "we can apply generalized quantum mechanics to these spacetimes to see how this expanded framework handles the breakdown of causal structure and the loss of unitarity .",
    "one might expect that if the region of ctcs was bounded in time , then the covariant theory of generalized quantum mechanics might reduce to the standard causal theory before the region of ctcs .",
    "however , in hartle s  @xcite formulation of a prescription to apply generalized quantum mechanics to a spacetime of this type , he finds the theory to be acausal : in addition to the expected acausality due to the presence of the ctcs , he also finds that if the region of ctcs is bounded in time , alternatives occurring before the region of ctcs will be affected by the existence and distribution of the later ctcs .",
    "the acausal effect is evident when the total cross section of a simple two - particle scattering experiment is calculated using generalized quantum mechanics .",
    "the cross - section has different values depending on the existence and configuration of ctcs in the experiment s future .",
    "we will calculate this effect for a simple case and discuss the size of the effect with different ctc configurations .",
    "in section 2 we find an expression for the probability for a transition from one state to another given a bounded region of ctcs to the future of the experiment .",
    "the region of ctcs is bounded in time , and so the regions of spacetime before and after the ctcs will be foliable by spacelike surfaces .",
    "therefore , we will be able to define states on spacelike surfaces and unitary evolution outside the ctc region .",
    "the transition probability is shown to be explicitly acausal due to its dependence on the non - unitary evolution caused by the future ctcs . in section 3",
    "we first specify the background spacetime for our calculation : a flat , non - relativistic spacetime , with an identification made between one spatial region at one time and the same spatial region at another time .",
    "this spacetime was introduced by politzer  @xcite , and has been studied by many authors  @xcite .",
    "this identification creates a region of ctcs between the two identified times . in order to calculate the probability derived in section 2",
    ", we first examine the non - unitary evolution of the pre- and post - transition states through the region of ctcs .",
    "we arrive at a rough estimate for this effect by calculating the non - unitary evolution as a function of the spatial distance between a gaussian wave - function and the center of the identified region .",
    "this is done using the born approximation in non - relativistic quantum mechanics with a contact potential .",
    "the non - unitary evolution occurs as a single particle passes through the region of ctcs and scatters off of a future version of itself or off of a particle trapped inside the time machine .    in section 4",
    "we calculate the deviation this effect causes in the total cross - section of a two particle scattering experiment if ctcs exist in the future of the experiment .",
    "if neither pre - scattering particle is aimed at the identified region , we find that for a specific range of scattering energies , the total cross - section will deviate from the value predicted if no ctcs existed .",
    "this deviation is shown to depend on a number of factors , including the total solid angle subtended by the time machine as viewed from the scattering center .",
    "it is shown that if the time machines are small , sparsely distributed , or far away , then the deviation in the total cross - section may be negligible as compared to the experimental error of known cross- sections .",
    "limits are placed on the possible distributions of identified regions given known errors of scattering experiments . for a spacetime filled with microscopic politzer identifications , or with an isotropic distribution of these identifications ,",
    "the cross - section is shown to agree with the standard result ( with no ctcs ) due to a cancellation effect .",
    "we wish to explore the acausality discussed in the introduction .",
    "hartle s prescription for applying generalized quantum mechanics to spacetimes with ctcs produces an acausal theory  @xcite .",
    "this acausality can be seen by examining a two - particle scattering experiment with a region of ctcs after the experiment .",
    "the total cross - section of the scattering experiment will be different from the value predicted if ctcs were not present . to describe this effect ,",
    "we begin by applying generalized quantum mechanics to a quantum transition when a bounded region of ctcs exists in the future of the transition .    we will use a fixed background spacetime which is flat and non - relativistic everywhere with a region of ctcs which begins at time @xmath0 and ends at @xmath1 .",
    "the transition of interest will be a two particle scattering event which both begins and ends before @xmath0 .",
    "the time evolution operator outside the time interval @xmath2 $ ] will be the standard time evolution operator @xmath3 between two times @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we can not express the evolution of states inside @xmath2 $ ] as an operator , since states are not defined in this region of spacetime .",
    "however , we will express the evolution from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , completely through the region of ctcs , as an operator @xmath6 , which may not be unitary .",
    "we split our hilbert space into a subspace which covers only the particles involved in the quantum transition , and another subspace which covers the remaining variables .",
    "we will call these two subspaces `` the experiment '' and `` the environment '' respectively .",
    "we assume that these subspaces are only weakly coupled .    in the language of generalized quantum mechanics , we begin with an initial density matrix @xmath7 at time @xmath8 , and define a set of alternatives for the post - scattering state at time @xmath9 . since @xmath9 is before the region of ctcs",
    ", we may express these alternatives as a set of projection operators @xmath10 at time @xmath9 .",
    "each coarse grained history will be identified with a given @xmath11 .",
    "using the heisenberg picture , the projection operators take the form [ hproj ]",
    "p_(t_2 ) = u^-1(t_2,t_1 ) p_u(t_2,t_1 ) .",
    "the transition of interest is a two - particle scattering experiment , and so our alternatives will be ranges of position and momentum for both particles in the post - scattering state .",
    "this scattering experiment and its background spacetime are illustrated in figure 1 .    in generalized quantum mechanics",
    "it is not always possible to assign a probability to a given history .",
    "two coarse - grained histories are said to decohere if the quantum interference between the two histories is zero .",
    "this quantum interference is measured by the decoherence functional , which is a complex functional of two coarse - grained histories .",
    "probabilities can be defined for a given exhaustive coarse - graining only if every pair of histories in the coarse - graining decohere  @xcite . for this paper",
    ", we will assume that the weak coupling of `` the experiment '' to `` the environment '' will cause decoherence , and therefore all probabilities are well defined  @xcite .",
    "since our probabilities are well defined , we may use generalized quantum mechanics to calculate the probability of a given coarse - grained history  @xcite .",
    "we do so by stringing together a series of heisenberg operators , as defined in ( [ hproj ] ) , which act on our initial density matrix @xmath12 .",
    "we simply insert the non - unitary operator , @xmath13 , into the string according to when the region of ctcs occurs with respect to the various alternatives .",
    "thus , the probability of an alternative @xmath14 occurring when our initial density matrix is @xmath12 is given by @xmath15}{tr[x\\rho x^\\dagger ] } \\ ; , % \\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the final time , to the far future , where we trace over all final states .",
    "equation ( [ genprob ] ) expresses the probability of a system beginning in a initial configuration represented by @xmath7 , and at some point in the history , one or more variables which represent the system falling into a range corresponding to an alternative @xmath18 .",
    "the latter part is represented by the projection operator @xmath19 .",
    "the system then experiences non - unitary evolution due to the ctcs , and finally we sum over all possible final configurations .",
    "the probability for a given history depends on the non - unitary evolution of the particles after the conclusion of the experiment .",
    "thus , the theory is manifestly acausal .",
    "if there is no region of ctcs to the future of the experiment , the probability reduces to @xmath20 \\ ; , % \\ ] ] which is causal",
    ". we will now find the deviation in @xmath21 if ctcs exist in the future of the experiment .",
    "since both @xmath8 and @xmath9 are before @xmath0 , we can express @xmath7 and @xmath22 in terms of quantum states at these times .",
    "for simplicity , we assume pure states : @xmath23 where @xmath24,@xmath25 are two - particle quantum states defined at @xmath26 respectively . substituting these into ( [ genprob ] ) we have @xmath27 \\ ; , % \\ ] ] where @xmath28 \\ ; .\\ ] ] we now explicitly write the probability in terms of single particle states . @xmath29 we will assume that @xmath13 can be factored into two non - unitary operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which evolve particles 1 and 2 respectively from @xmath0 to @xmath1 : @xmath32 this assumption is sensible as we expect the distance between particles after the scattering event to be large compared to the interaction range . substituting ( [ gfactor ] ) and ( [ xfactor ] ) into ( [ newprob ] ) , we have @xmath33 many authors  @xcite have shown that the operator which evolves a state from before a region of ctcs to after that region is non - unitary for interacting theories in perturbation theory .",
    "these authors showed that the non - unitary component of the evolution is due to particle interactions in the appropriate theory .",
    "when the evolution is expanded using perturbation theory , with a small parameter @xmath34 associated with the interaction , the non - unitary component is of order @xmath34 or higher .",
    "thus , we write @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath37 are operators which express the non - unitary component of the evolution , and @xmath38 is some small parameter .",
    "we will only examine the evolution to first order , so @xmath39 to first order in @xmath34 , @xmath40 where @xmath41 ignoring all terms of @xmath42 or higher , we get @xmath43 \\ ; .",

    "this factor depends on the non - unitary evolution that both the final and initial state experience as they pass between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . without scattering . ]    as noted before , if no ctcs exist in the experiment s future , ( [ prob ] ) reduces to p(_i ) = | _ i| |^2 .",
    "this is the result predicted by standard quantum mechanics , which is causal .",
    "equation ( [ prob ] ) expresses the probability for a certain alternative to occur after a scattering event .",
    "since this result depends on the non - unitary evolution that both the pre- and post - scattering states experience between @xmath0 and @xmath1 we must investigate this effect in detail in order to calculate the total cross section for a scattering experiment .",
    "the post - scattering trajectory of the particles , and their location at @xmath45 will depend on the scattering angle .",
    "since the identified regions are spatially bounded , the non - unitary effect on a given particle may depend on the spatial distance between the particle and the identified region as the particle passes from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "we let @xmath47 represent a generic particle which , in our case , will be one of the particles from the scattering experiment . we will find the behavior of the non - unitary evolution which @xmath47 experiences as a function of the particle s distance from the center of the identified region .",
    "there are many different spacetimes which contain ctcs . for our calculation",
    "we will use a 1 + 1 dimensional spacetime introduced by politzer  @xcite .",
    "this spacetime is simple , yet has all the essential features of a spacetime with ctcs .",
    "we review the politzer spacetime , which is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the horizontal lines of length @xmath48 , centered at @xmath49 , at @xmath45 and @xmath46 are identified so that along them the region immediately before @xmath45 connects smoothly to that after @xmath46 , while the region immediately before @xmath46 connects smoothly to that after @xmath45 .",
    "we define @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52",

    "each particle may interact with a future version of itself or with a particle trapped inside the time machine .",
    "we expect that the inter - particle interaction will be short ranged such as a screened coulomb force or a nuclear force .",

    "although the scattering experiment itself will be considered in 3 + 1 dimensions in section 4 , here we will look at the interaction which occurs as a single particle passes by the time machine in 1 + 1 dimensions for simplicity , and then generalize our result to 3 + 1 dimensions .",

    "therefore , @xmath75 is also the sum of an infinite number of terms .",
    "we will initially simplify the calculation as politzer does @xcite by assuming @xmath76 . for a given @xmath67 ,",
    "each subsequent term has another winding through the time machine and therefore another integral over @xmath54 .",
    "the assumption @xmath76 can be interpreted as choosing @xmath77 and @xmath48 such that the wave packet spreads significantly compared to @xmath48 during the time @xmath77 . for each additional winding through the identified regions ,",
    "more of the wave packet will spread outside @xmath78 and not return to @xmath0 to wind through again .",
    "thus , for each subsequent winding , less and less of the wave packet will remain to contribute to the non - unitary evolution of the next winding .",
    "thus any given term in the expansion is smaller than the previous term by a factor of the small parameter @xmath79 .",
    "we can therefore approximate each @xmath67 by the first term in its expansion , i.e. , the term with the lowest number of windings . with this assumption , the diagrammatic representation for @xmath75",
    "is shown below in figure 4 .    since we are interested in estimating the dependence of @xmath80 on the particle s spatial distance from the center of @xmath78 , we will take @xmath74 to be a stationary gaussian wave packet centered at @xmath81 with width @xmath82 : [ gaussian ] ( x , t_- ) = ^-d^- .",
    "we are looking for the dependence of @xmath83 on @xmath84 for large @xmath84 .",
    "thus we assume x_c & > > & l , + x_c & > > & d , + x_c & > > & .",
    "an expression for @xmath83 is found from its diagrammatic representation .",
    "the full calculation is completed in the appendix , and the dependence on @xmath84 extracted .",
    "in essence , the integral is an overlap between @xmath74 and a particle caught in @xmath53 .",
    "since we are using a contact potential , the overlap integral will fall off exponentially as the gaussian wave packet is moved farther from the time machine .",
    "thus , the dominant @xmath84 behavior is found to be [ aande ] || = 2 re , where @xmath85 due to the contact potential , the non - unitary evolution of @xmath86 is proportional to the overlap between the wave packet and the region @xmath78 .",
    "we interpret the result above to mean that the effect falls off exponentially with the spatial distance between the center of the wave packet and the center of @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , we expect @xmath87 unless there is a significant overlap between the wave packet and the region @xmath78 .",
    "if @xmath88 , the width of the wave packet is smaller than that of @xmath78 , and we expect a significant overlap only when the center of the wave packet is inside @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath89 unless @xmath90 for some time between @xmath45 and @xmath46 . if @xmath91 , the width of the particle is larger than that of the time machine , and we expect that @xmath92 may be significant even if @xmath93 . in this case , we expect the overlap between the wave packet and the region @xmath94 to be non - negligible as long as the wave packet is positioned such that the center of @xmath78 lies a distance less than @xmath82 from the center of the wave packet .",
    "now we generalize our result to include the case when the minimal winding approximation ( @xmath76 ) does not hold . in this case , there are an infinite number of @xmath95 terms in our expansion for @xmath92 .",
    "these terms represent all possible numbers of windings through the identification , and each term can be represented by a diagram .",
    "the summation of these terms is non - trivial .",
    "however , we are only interested in the dependence of @xmath96 on @xmath84 for large @xmath84 . in each term of the expansion @xmath84 will appear only in @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "thus , the dependence of each term on @xmath84 will only come from @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and the propagators which connect the external wave packets to the time machine .",
    "the propagators which connect one identified region to the other , or one of the identified regions to the interaction point will not contribute the to the @xmath84 dependence of the term",
    ". we will therefore organize the infinite set of diagrams into 3 distinct classes .",
    "each diagram has two external propagators which connect @xmath97 and @xmath98 to the identified regions .",
    "since we are limiting our expansion to @xmath95 each term will be represented by a diagram with only one interaction point .",
    "the three classes will be the sets of diagrams where both , one , or neither of the external propagators connect to the interaction point .",
    "we will call these classes a , b , and c respectively .",
    "the lowest winding diagrams are shown below in figure 5 , grouped by class .",
    "as discussed above , all diagrams in a given class will have the same dependence on @xmath84 .",
    "the @xmath84 dependence of diagram ( a.i ) was calculated in the appendix , and is shown in ( [ aande ] ) .",
    "therefore , all diagrams in class a behave like @xmath99 for large @xmath84 .",
    "similar calculations were done for diagrams ( b.i ) and ( c.i ) . both were found to behave like @xmath100 for large @xmath84 , and so all @xmath95 diagrams are dominated by a factor of @xmath101 for large @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , all conclusions made about the non - unitary evolution for the minimal winding case ( @xmath102 ) also hold when all windings are included .",
    "since the non - unitary component of the evolution drops off exponentially with the spatial distance between the wave packet and @xmath78 , the non - unitary component of the evolution will be non - negligible only if the particle passes through @xmath53 , the region of spacetime between the identified surfaces .",
    "in section 2 we found that a region of ctcs could alter the probability assigned to a given history , even if the region of ctcs was in the future of the last alternative in the history .",

    ".    the spacetime chosen here will be the same as that of section 3 except that we will be working in 3 + 1 dimensions .",

    "this expression assumes that neither pre - scattering particle is aimed towards @xmath104 and that the velocity of the particles is within the range specified in ( [ velrange ] ) .",
    "we have shown that with hartle s prescription for calculating probabilities in spacetimes with ctcs the total cross - section of a scattering experiment before the region of ctcs will deviate from the standard ( no ctcs ) value as shown in ( [ dev ] ) .",
    "the question now arises : will this effect be large enough to be measured in a typical scattering experiment",
    "? we will now give an estimate of the size of this effect for a few cases .",
    "if topological or geometric defects which cause ctcs are allowed by the laws of physics we expect that the scale for naturally occurring defects will be the planck scale , for both time and space @xcite .",
    "we will model a defect of this kind using a planck - scale politzer time machine .",
    "we plug in reasonable values for electron - electron scattering into ( [ dev ] ) and take a planck - scale time machine a planck length away from the scattering center . if we assume that the condition on the velocity of the electrons given in ( [ velrange ] ) is met , then the deviation in the total cross - section is approximately @xmath153 part in @xmath154 .",
    "if the planck - scale time machine is @xmath153 meter from the scattering center , the deviation drops to @xmath153 part in @xmath155 .",
    "if we include the possibility of man - made time machines , which could be of a size traversable by humans  @xcite , then the deviation becomes larger .",
    "for a identified region 1 meter from the scattering center with @xmath156 m and @xmath157s , the deviation is @xmath153 part in @xmath158 . for the purpose of comparison to typical experimental error of total cross - sections we will use the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron , which has an accuracy of @xmath153 part in @xmath159  @xcite .",
    "we will use this result as a upper bound on the sensitivity of total cross - section measurements .",
    "therefore , the deviation we have calculated in the total - cross section due to a politzer time machine in our future is negligible compared to the experimental error associated with the measurement .",
    "therefore , even if the time machine is located such that ( [ velrange ] ) is satisfied it would be impossible to detect a single planck - scale or human - scale time machine in our future from its effect on the total cross - section of a scattering event .",
    "if multiple time machines exist , then for a given scattering event the only ones which will contribute to a deviation in the total cross - section will be those located such that the velocity of the particles satisfies ( [ velrange ] ) .",
    "we have found that the effect is additive for multiple time machines which satisfy this condition .",
    "again , we assume that neither of the pre - scattering particles are aimed at any of the time machines which contribute to the deviation .",
    "the total cross section for a specific scattering event can be computed by selecting only the time machines for which the velocity satisfies ( [ velrange ] ) , calculating the deviation in the total cross - section for each time machine using ( [ dev ] ) and adding the deviations for all the time machines selected .",
    "therefore , the more time machines we have in our future , the greater the chance of observing a deviation in the total cross - section of a scattering event in our present , as long as neither pre - scattering particle is aimed at a time machine . for a given event ,",
    "if there are more time machines then there is a greater chance that enough time machines will be at correct locations in spacetime to satisfy ( [ velrange ] ) and cause a measurable deviation .    because of the additive effect it is possible for a distribution of time machines throughout spacetime to cause a deviation in the total cross - section of a scattering event which would be measurable . in general",
    ", we can not place limits on size , number or proximity of time machines , because for any given values for these quantities , it would be possible to design a configuration of time machines such that ( [ velrange ] ) was not satisfied for a given set of scattering events . in other words ,",
    "the time machines could be distributed such that the particles involved in the scattering events would never pass inside any of the time machines , and therefore no deviation in the total cross - section would occur . also , these results are only valid if neither pre - scattering particle is aimed at any of the contributing time machines . what is possible , however , is to rule out specific spacetime distributions of time machines in light of specific scattering experiments .",
    "for example , if we take an electron - electron scattering experiment for which the measured total cross - section agrees with the standard predicted result ( no ctcs ) within the experimental error , then we can rule out a spacetime which has either planck - scale or human - scale time machines everywhere in spacetime except for the region of spacetime which surrounds the trajectory of the pre - scattering particles . when we calculate the deviation in the total cross - section due this distribution using ( [ tcs1 ] ) , we find that the term in the numerator , which comes from integrating the non - unitary effect over all the post - scattering states is infinite .",
    "due to lack of time machines in the path of the initial particle , the term in the denominator , which represents the non - unitary effect of the pre - scattering particles , is simply @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , hartle s prescription predicts an infinite deviation in the total cross section in this case , which is clearly absurd , so such spacetimes are ruled out .    the same result ensues if instead of the spacetime discussed above we have an expanding shell of time machines : at any given moment in time there is a spherical distribution of time machines around the scattering center at the same radius as the post - scattering particles .",
    "again , the region surrounding the trajectory of the pre - scattering particles is empty .",
    "this distribution of time machines has an identical effect as the previous distribution , since this distribution is simply the subset of time machines in the previous example for which the particles velocity satisfies ( [ velrange ] ) .",
    "it is also possible to imagine finite versions of these examples which would cause measurable deviations in the total cross - section . for either of the examples above ,",
    "a finite distribution of time machines would lead to a measurable deviation in the total cross - section section of a given experiment if the radius of the distribution is large enough . for planck - sized time machines",
    ", the radius of the distribution must be approximately @xmath160light years which is extremely large .",
    "however , a distribution of human - scale time machines ( with the dimensions discussed above ) centered on the the scattering event need only have a radius of 10 km in order to cause a measurable deviation in the total cross section . if the distribution is not centered on the event , or is at a distance from the scattering event , the effect is diminished , and therefore we need a larger distribution in order for the deviation to be measurable . if hartle s prescription for applying generalized quantum mechanics to spacetimes with ctcs is correct , then spacetimes with any of these distributions of ctcs must be disallowed .",
    "for reasonably sized time machines , one needs a large number of time machines in close proximity to the scattering center in order for a measurable deviation in the total cross - section to occur .",
    "clearly , there are a number of realistic distributions of politzer time machines which would lead to deviations in the total cross section which are minute compared to the experimental error of any given scattering experiment .",
    "if the time machines are small , far away , or sparsely distributed , then it is very possible that a region of ctc s could go completely unnoticed .",
    "some authors  @xcite have asserted that quantum gravity predicts that at the planck scale , spacetime is filled with ctcs .",
    "one possibility is that spacetime can be viewed as a quantum foam , with planck - scale ctcs throughout spacetime .",
    "another hypothesis is that ctcs will become prevalent during the big bang and the big crunch , due to quantum gravitational effects which are large at these times .",
    "we can model these possibilities simply with planck - scale politzer time machines which pervade spacetime . in any of these cases one might expect a significant deviation in the total cross - section of a scattering experiment due to the dense distribution of time machines .",
    "however , as we will show , this is not the case .",
    "each of these cases involves an isotropic distribution of time machines : all pre- and post - scattering particles will pass through the same distribution of time machine",
    ". we will now use ( [ tcs1 ] ) to examine the total cross section of a scattering event .",
    "we will assume that @xmath161 is the total non - unitary effect of all time machines which affected the particle @xmath162 .",
    "( @xmath163 is generic and could be any of the pre- or post - scattering particles . )",
    "@xmath164 will be identical for all states , including all pre - scattering states , and all possible post - scattering states , since the distribution of time machines is isotropic .",
    "when we calculate the total cross - section using ( [ tcs1 ] ) , the integrals over @xmath141 give factors of @xmath165 , which leads to the result :  = thus , when the distribution of time machines is isotropic , there is a cancellation effect , and the predicted total cross - section agrees with result expected if no ctcs existed .",
    "we see that this is a limiting case as @xmath166 approaches @xmath165 .",
    "therefore , we also expect the effect to be small if the distribution is nearly isotropic , or if only a small fraction of the solid angle has a different distribution of ctcs . in this case",
    "we would expect the effect caused by the initial and final particles to be nearly identical as long as the initial particles are not aimed at the small fraction of solid angle with a different distribution of time machines from the rest .",

    "in addition to finding the large @xmath84 behavior of @xmath83 , we are also interested in finding the exact expression for the non - unitary evolution when the non - unitary evolution is significant . as discussed in section 3 , the non - unitary evolution is dependent on the overlap between the the wave function and @xmath78 between the times @xmath0 and @xmath1 . we will no longer examine stationary particles , but moving ones , whose trajectories are such that the overlap between their wave packets and @xmath78 are significant between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in general , it will be difficult to get a simple analytic expression for the non - unitary evolution , so we will examine the cases where the particle is much smaller or larger than the identified region : @xmath193 and @xmath194 respectively . if @xmath195 this corresponds to the particle passing through @xmath53 , while if @xmath196 , then the particle s trajectory must be such that the center of @xmath78 passes within @xmath82 of the wave packet s center between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "now we will assume that the wave function s overlap with @xmath78 will be constant for the entire time that the overlap is significant .",
    "thus , if @xmath193 , then the width of the wave packet will stay much smaller than @xmath48 for the entire time that the particle is inside @xmath78 , while if @xmath194 the wave packet is very wide , and will not spread enough to change the overlap inside a half- width significantly . thus , if @xmath198 , then the gaussian integral will yield approximately a factor of @xmath199 when the particle is inside @xmath53 , while if @xmath194 , the integral yields approximately a factor of @xmath200 when the center of @xmath104 is within @xmath82 of the center of the wave packet .",
    "if we assume that the particle s motion relative to @xmath104 will cause the particle to pass through @xmath53 for a finite period of time , which we will call @xmath145 , then the the integral over time will yield a factor of @xmath145 .",
    "therefore ( [ longint ] ) reduces to [ directhit1 ] |a | ^v_0 t h(d , l ) , where @xmath201 combining ( [ directhit1 ] ) and ( [ aamp ] ) , we get [ directhit2 ] || 2 ( ) ^ v_0 t h(d , l ) . this is the non - unitary component of the evolution from @xmath0 to @xmath1 when the particle passes through the region @xmath53 in 1 + 1 dimensions . in 3 + 1 dimensions , this result generalizes to || -2 ( ) ^ .",
