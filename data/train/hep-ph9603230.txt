    "the longitudinal structure function @xmath7 which corresponds to the interaction of the longitudinally polarized virtual photon in the one  photon  exchange mechanism of inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering is a very interesting dynamical quantity since at least at low @xmath1 the dominant contribution to it comes from gluons .",
    "the experimental determination of @xmath0 is in general difficult and requires a measurement of the @xmath8 dependence of the deep inelastic cross section for fixed @xmath1 and @xmath2 where , as usual , @xmath9 and @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 denoting the four momentum of the incident lepton , the four momentum of the proton and four momentum transfer between the leptons respectively , see fig .",
    "1 . in the `` naive '' quark - parton model",
    "the structure function @xmath7 vanishes . to be precise , in the limit of large @xmath2 it is proportional to @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the quark mass and @xmath15 is the transverse momentum of the quark which",
    ", in the naive parton model , is by definition limited @xcite .",
    "this remains approximately valid in the leading logarithmic approximation where only collinear gluon emissions are considered .",
    "the limitation of the quark transverse momentum no longer holds in the next - to - leading logarithmic approximation when the point - like qcd interactions allow ( with probability @xmath16 ) @xmath17 to grow as @xmath2 with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "thus @xmath7 acquires a leading twist contribution , proportional to @xmath18 @xcite . at small @xmath1",
    "it is driven by the gluons through the @xmath19 transition and , in fact , @xmath0 can be used as a very useful quantity for a direct measurement of the gluon distribution in a nucleon @xcite .    in the limit @xmath4",
    "the structure function @xmath0 has to vanish as @xmath20 ( for fixed @xmath21 ) .",
    "this kinematical constraint eliminates potential kinematical singularities at @xmath22 of the hadronic tensor @xmath23 defining the virtual compton scattering amplitude @xcite .",
    "it also reflects the simple physical fact that the total cross section @xmath24 describing the interaction of the longitudinally polarized virtual photons has to vanish in the real photoproduction limit .",
    "the differential cross section for inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering is most frequently expressed in terms of the structure function @xmath25 and the ratio @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the structure function associated with transversely polarized virtual photons .",
    "unfortunately measurements of @xmath28 are difficult and thus scarce , especially at low @xmath1 and/or low @xmath2 . for @xmath29 0.01 and/or @xmath300.5",
    "gev@xmath31 the experimental information is particularly poor .",
    "the measurements of @xmath32 are compiled in fig.2 .",
    "preliminary measurements in the low @xmath1 region have been announced by the ccfr collaboration @xcite and by nmc @xcite .",
    "all the data indicate a small value of @xmath32 at moderate values of @xmath1 and an increase of @xmath32 with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "the data collected in fig.2 come from experiments carried out on different targets .",
    "this is justified since the measured differences @xmath33 do not exhibit any significant dependence on @xmath1 and they are consistent with zero , @xcite .",
    "all the data in fig.2 ( except those of slac e140x ) have been fitted to a common function ( the curve in fig.2 ) , @xmath34 , which is constructed to extrapolate to theoretically reasonable values outside the kinematical range of the data : namely at @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "in particular the last constraint means that @xmath34 matches @xmath38 , @xcite , at high @xmath2 .",
    "the fit expression should not however be used for @xmath390.35gev@xmath31 which means that no constraints are given on the behaviour of @xmath32 at low @xmath2 .",
    "this is a serious deficiency in the procedure used to extract polarized and non  polarized structure functions from the experimental data , especially in the calculation of radiative corrections .",
    "thus the procedure commonly accepted in data analysis is to assume @xmath400.35 gev@xmath41 with 100@xmath42 uncertainty for @xmath390.35 gev@xmath31 .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath32 is then propagated into a contribution ( usually the dominant one ) to the systematic error on the extracted structure functions .",
    "the need for a more precise determination of @xmath32 at low @xmath2 is thus clearly seen .    at large @xmath2 and large @xmath1 ( @xmath43 )",
    "perturbative qcd describes reasonably well the available data on the ratio @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "it has however been noticed that in order to correctly accommodate experimental information from the moderately large @xmath2 region , a significant `` higher twist '' contribution , which vanishes as @xmath44 at large @xmath2 , has to be added as well @xcite .    while the longitudinal structure function is ( at least theoretically ) fairly well understood at high @xmath2 very little ( if anything ) is known about its possible extrapolation towards the region of low @xmath2 .",
    "this should be contrasted with the structure function @xmath25 for which several dynamically motivated extrapolations exist , cf .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide an extrapolation of the structure function @xmath7 towards the region of moderate and low values of @xmath2 .",
    "this extrapolation will be based on the photon - gluon fusion mechanism , essential at low @xmath1 and suitably extended into the region of low @xmath2 . a similar description of both the structure functions @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath0 has been considered in ref .",
    "we shall explicitly introduce an additional higher twist term which comes from the contribution of the quarks ( antiquarks ) with limited transverse momentum .",
    "we assume that this term is described by `` soft '' pomeron exchange .",
    "we treat this contribution phenomenologically and determine its normalisation from the ( non - perturbative ) part of the structure function @xmath25 .",
    "the model embodies the kinematical constraint @xmath3 in the limit @xmath4 ( for fixed @xmath21 or @xmath45 ) .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in the next section we discuss the photon ",
    "gluon fusion contribution to the structure function @xmath0 and its extension to the low @xmath2 region . in section 3",
    "we present a phenomenological model for the higher twist contribution to @xmath0 at small @xmath1 which is based on the soft pomeron exchange mechanism .",
    "section 4 contains numerical predictions for @xmath0 and @xmath32 , while section 5 contains a brief summary of our results .",
    "at small @xmath1 and at large @xmath2 the structure functions can be computed from the @xmath46 factorization theorem @xcite which corresponds to the ( virtual ) photon - gluon fusion mechanism shown in fig.3 .",
    "the structure function @xmath0 obtained from the diagram of fig.3 is given by @xcite : @xmath47 where , @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 is the qcd coupling and its argument will be specified later .",
    "the transverse momentum @xmath52 and the variables @xmath53 are defined as follows : @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the transverse momentum of the quark(antiquark ) in the quark box ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "the variable @xmath57 is the corresponding sudakov parameter appearing in the quark momentum decomposition into the basic lightlike four vectors , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the nucleon mass .",
    "the function @xmath62 is the so  called unintegrated gluon distribution .",
    "it is related to the ( scale dependent ) gluon distribution @xmath63 by @xmath64    the parameters @xmath65 are the masses of the quarks .",
    "it should be noted that the integrals @xmath66 defined by ( [ flint ] ) are infrared finite even if we set @xmath67 .",
    "the non - zero values of the quark masses are however necessary if formula ( [ flsum ] ) is extrapolated down to @xmath22 respecting the kinematical constraint @xmath3 .",
    "the non - zero quark masses then play the role of the infrared regulator .",
    "it should be noticed that the expressions ( [ flsum],[flint ] ) define @xmath0 as an analytic function of @xmath2 except for the cut @xmath68 .",
    "equation ( [ flint ] ) can be interpreted as representing the rescattering of the @xmath69 fluctuation of the virtual photon through the exchange of two and more interacting gluons .",
    "both the diagonal and non  diagonal transitions in this rescattering are included .",
    "we assume that equations ( [ flsum],[flint ] ) embody ( at least in the average sense and as far as the position of the singularities in the @xmath2 plane are concerned ) also the virtual vector meson contributions which couple to virtual photons .",
    "this will fix the magnitude of the corresponding quark mass parameters to be @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the mass of the lightest vector meson corresponding to the @xmath72 pair .",
    "the integration limits in ( [ flint ] ) are constrained by the condition : @xmath73 the condition @xmath74 is automatically satisfied ( see eq.([yq ] ) )    the unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath75 should in principle be obtained from the solution of the balitzkij ",
    "fadin  kuraev",
    " lipatov ( bfkl ) equation @xcite . in our calculations",
    "we shall use the following approximation , @xmath76 where @xmath77 satisfies the conventional ( lo or nlo ) altarelli - parisi equations . in this approximation one",
    "neglects the higher order small @xmath1 resummation effects in the gluon anomalous dimension .",
    "the gluon anomalous dimension @xmath78 is the moment of the splitting function @xmath79 , @xmath80 the bfkl equation effectively resums the leading powers of @xmath81 i.e. @xmath82 @xmath83 , where the coefficients @xmath84 can be calculated from the kernel of the bfkl equation @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the sum on the right  hand  side of ( [ andim ] ) only starts at @xmath85 . as a result",
    "it affects the evolution of gluon distribution ( and of observable quantities ) only at very small values of @xmath1 ( @xmath86 ) . in our approximation",
    "this contribution is neglected .",
    "expression ( [ flsum ] ) can be represented in the following `` @xmath87 factorized '' form : @xmath88 where the function @xmath89 can be regarded as the longitudinal structure function of the off - shell gluon with virtuality @xmath90 .",
    "it corresponds to the quark box ( and crossed - box ) diagrams in the upper part of the diagram in fig.3 and is given by the following formula : @xmath91 @xmath92 where @xmath93 are defined by equation ( [ d ] ) .",
    "the leading twist part of the @xmath87 factorization formula can be rewritten in a collinear factorized form : @xmath94 where the leading powers of @xmath95 , ( @xmath96 ) have been resummed in @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "thus for instance the moment function @xmath99 is related to the moment function @xmath100 , by @xmath101 where @xmath102 our approximation corresponds to setting @xmath103 .",
    "it correctly generates the first three corrections to @xmath104 which are presumably most important at moderately small values of @xmath1 .    in the `` on - shell '' approximation one sets @xmath105 in the argument of @xmath106 and restricts the integration over @xmath90 to the region @xmath107 . after taking into account ( [ intg ] )",
    "the structure function @xmath0 can be expressed in terms of the conventional gluon distribution @xmath108 , @xmath109 where now @xmath110 and @xmath111    in order to extrapolate the formula ( [ flsum ] ) to the low @xmath2 region ( with @xmath66 given by ( [ flint ] ) or ( [ iq ] ) ) we have to freeze the evolution of @xmath112 and freeze the argument of @xmath18 . to this end",
    "we substitute @xmath113 instead of @xmath2 as the argument of @xmath51 and of @xmath108 .",
    "this substitution may be justified by analyticity arguments i.e. we want @xmath66 to have `` threshold '' singularities for @xmath114 .",
    "moreover , for heavy quarks , it is the heavy mass squared and not @xmath2 which should control the scale of @xmath51 and of the parton distributions for moderately large values of @xmath2 .",
    "it should be noted that after those modifications the structure function @xmath0 can be continued down to @xmath22 , respecting the kinematical constraint ( @xmath3 in the limit @xmath4 ) .",
    "it follows from ( [ iq ] ) that the structure function @xmath0 in the on - shell approximation can be represented by @xmath115 where @xmath116 @xmath117 and @xmath118 it should be noted that in the large @xmath2 limit , the first term @xmath119 becomes equal to the standard qcd formula describing the leading order contribution to @xmath0 originating from the photon - gluon fusion @xcite , @xmath120 in the large @xmath2 region formula ( [ efel ] ) with non - zero quark masses generates also power corrections enhanced by logarithmic factor present in the term @xmath121 .    when analysing the @xmath46 factorization formula it is convenient to use the `` on - shell '' approximation in the region @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is a parameter of the order 1 gev@xmath31 and to leave the remaining part ( @xmath124 ) unchanged .",
    "the first term is then given by ( [ efel ] ) , ( [ iq3 ] ) , ( [ iq4 ] ) where gluon distribution is evaluated at the scale @xmath123 instead of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this gives the following representation for the structure function @xmath0 : @xmath125 @xmath126 where @xmath127 is given by equations ( [ efel ] )  ( [ iq4 ] ) with @xmath128 instead of @xmath108 in the integrals ( [ iq3 ] ) and ( [ iq4 ] ) .",
    "the argument of @xmath51 in the formulae ( [ iq3 ] ) , ( [ iq4 ] ) defining @xmath129 and in the second term of ( [ flmod ] ) will be set equal to @xmath113 .",
    "the phenomenological description of the experimental data for the ratio @xmath28 in the region of moderately large values of @xmath2 and large values of @xmath1 ( @xmath130 ) requires a significant higher twist contribution , i.e. the term which vanishes as @xmath44 for @xmath131 @xcite .    in this section",
    "we present the phenomenological model for @xmath0 which takes into account the higher twist effect .",
    "the idea is to treat the contributions from the regions of low and high values of quark transverse momenta in different ways .",
    "that is we divide the integration over @xmath132 into two parts : the region @xmath133 , and @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is an arbitrary cut - off , chosen to be of the order of 1 gev@xmath31 .",
    "we leave unchanged the contribution coming from the high @xmath136 region whereas in the low @xmath136 region , which is presumably dominated by the soft physics , we use the `` on - shell '' approximation and make the substitution : @xmath137 this gives the following representation of the higher twist contribution to @xmath0 : @xmath138 where @xmath139 has been defined in ( [ dq ] ) .",
    "the constant @xmath140 is not a free parameter .",
    "we estimate it from @xmath6 assuming that the non - perturbative contribution to @xmath6 in the scaling region also comes from the region of low values of @xmath141 and is controlled by the same parameter .",
    "the term @xmath142 can be interpreted as representing the contribution of soft pomeron exchange with intercept equal to 1 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath142 given by equation ( [ flht ] ) will vanish as @xmath44 in the high @xmath2 limit ( modulo logarithmically varying factors ) .",
    "we call it therefore a `` higher twist contribution '' .",
    "it should be noticed that this term will also respect the kinematical constraint @xmath3 in the limit @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding formula describing the photon - gluon contribution to the structure function @xmath143 is @xmath144\\;. \\label{ft}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we integrate this expression over the low @xmath136 region ( @xmath145 ) after substituting @xmath146 and retain its limiting value as @xmath131 .",

    "the complete structure function @xmath0 is represented as @xmath151 where @xmath152 is calculated from equations ( [ efel ] )  ( [ iq4 ] ) , or from equation ( [ flmod ] ) with the additional constraint @xmath153 in order to avoid double counting .",
    "in this section we present the numerical analysis of the structure function @xmath0 .",
    "we shall also perform the analysis of the ratio @xmath28 and compare it with the available data .    in our calculations",
    "we have included the contributions of the @xmath154 quarks with masses @xmath155 respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath135 was set to be equal 0.8 gev@xmath31 .",
    "we have varied this parameter in the interval 0.81.5 gev@xmath31 and found that the results for @xmath32 are not very sensitive to these changes , i.e. the ratio @xmath32 does not change by more than 10% .",
    "we have used the grv @xcite and mrs(a ) @xcite parton distributions both in the `` on - shell '' and `` off - shell '' approximation . in the case of the grv parametrisation lo gluons and qcd coupling constant were used . in our calculations",
    "we froze the evolution in @xmath2 in the argument of @xmath18 and also in the function @xmath108 as explained before .",
    "besides the dominant ( at small @xmath1 ) photon - gluon fusion @xmath156 contribution , we have also included in @xmath0 a contribution from quarks taking into account threshold effects in the corresponding convolution integral i.e. @xmath157\\;.\\ ] ] where @xmath158 is given by ( [ barxq ] ) .    in figures 4 and 5 we show our results for the longitudinal structure function calculated without an additional higher twist contribution .",
    "@xmath0 is plotted as the function of @xmath2 for different values of @xmath1 , and as a function of @xmath1 for different values of @xmath2 .",
    "the theoretical curves reflect the different behaviour of the mrs(a ) and grv gluon distributions .",
    "the difference between the on  shell and off ",
    "shell approaches is in general small , particularly in the small @xmath2 region .",
    "it can be seen from fig.5 , that the magnitude of @xmath0 strongly decreases as @xmath4 .    in figures 6 and 7",
    "we show results which include the additional higher twist contribution .",
    "it can be seen from these plots that the resulting magnitude of the longitudinal structure function is now bigger in the low @xmath2 region than in the previous case .",
    "it should also be noted that the structure function @xmath0 flattens as a function of @xmath1 in the low @xmath1 and low @xmath2 region .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the `` soft pomeron '' parametrization of the higher twist term .",
    "we have also calculated the ratio @xmath159 .",
    "the structure function @xmath6 was parametrized following the model of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this model",
    "the structure function @xmath6 is represented by @xmath160 the first term describes the vmd contribution and the sum extends over the low mass vector mesons .",
    "the parameter @xmath161 can be estimated from the leptonic widths of the vector mesons , @xmath162 is the total vector meson - proton cross section , and @xmath163 where @xmath61 is the nucleon mass .",
    "the structure function @xmath164 is obtained from the qcd improved parton model .",
    "the variable @xmath165 is defined as @xmath166 in the case of the grv parametrization only the light quarks contribution was included in @xmath167 in the formula ( [ f2vdm ] ) .",
    "the charm quark contribution to @xmath6 was calculated from the on - shell photon - gluon fusion .    in figures 8 and 9",
    "we show our results for the ratio @xmath28 .",
    "we see that this quantity is sensitive to the different parton distributions which were used in calculating both @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "in particular the structure function @xmath6 obtained from the formula ( [ f2vdm ] ) with @xmath167 calculated from the mrs(a ) parametrization turns out to be steeper function of @xmath1 in the low @xmath2 region than that when @xmath167 is calculated from the grv partons . as a result",
    "the ratio @xmath32 decreases with @xmath1 as @xmath35 .",
    "this effect is weaker if @xmath0 does not contain the higher twist modification .",
    "the spread of the theoretical predictions can be used as an estimate of the corresponding errors caused by the uncertainty of @xmath32 in the low @xmath2 , low @xmath1 region . for the intermediate values of @xmath2",
    "this model coincides with slac parametrization , whereas for lower values of @xmath2 , outside the range of the validity of this parametrization , it quickly vanishes as @xmath4 .    in fig .",
    "10 we show extrapolation of our model calculations for @xmath32 up to @xmath168 and confront this extrapolation with the available data .",
    "although this value of @xmath1 is already too large for our model to be applicable one can see that it predicts reasonably well the magnitude and the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath32 .",
    "the agreement with experimental results improves if we renormalise the phenomenological parameter @xmath140 by a factor of 1.2  1.5 .",
    "in this paper we have presented possible parametrization of the longitudinal structure function @xmath0 and of the ratio @xmath28 in the region of low @xmath2 and low @xmath1 .",
    "we based this parametrization on the photon - gluon fusion mechanism suitably extrapolated into the region of low @xmath2 .",
    "the extrapolation respected the kinematical constraint @xmath3 in the limit @xmath4 .",
    "we have also included a separate contribution from the higher twist term which corresponds to soft pomeron exchange .",
    "its coupling to external virtual photons was assumed to be proportional to that of the ( on - shell ) gluons but with limited transverse momentum of the quarks ( antiquarks ) within the quark box ( and crossed - box ) diagram , eq .",
    "( [ flht ] ) .",
    "we have also calculated the ratio @xmath26 utilising the parametrization of the structure function @xmath25 from ref .",
    "our results show that the structure function @xmath0 and the ratio @xmath32 become negligibly small in the region of low @xmath2 ( @xmath1690.1 gev@xmath31 or so ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath28 turns out to be essentially independent of @xmath1 in the low @xmath1 , low @xmath2 region .",
    "we have also noticed that in this region the magnitude of both @xmath0 and of the ratio @xmath32 is relatively insensitive to the variations of the input parton distributions .",
    "we believe that our results will also be useful in the radiative corrections procedure as well as in extracting the magnitude of the spin dependent structure functions from the experimental data .",
