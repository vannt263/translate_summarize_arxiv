    "the irregular and complex structure of the time series ( ecg ) of human heartbeat dynamics is an object of considerable clinical and research interest @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this structure is connected not only to the external and internal perturbations but also depends on the synergetic action of muscle and nervous systems which influences the correlation properties of the time series . in many simple systems",
    "the correlation function of the measured time series usually decays exponentially with the time . in complex systems the correlations can decay with power law and because no characteristic scale is associated with the power law",
    "such systems are called scale - free .",
    "their correlations are called long - range because at large time scales the power law function is always larger than the exponential function .",
    "below we are interested in the presence of long - range correlations in the time series for heartbeat activity of drosophila melanogaster - the classical object of genetics . due to the short reproduction cycle of drosophila",
    "we can investigate the correlation properties of the heartbeat dynamics for three consequent generations .",
    "this allows us to study the relation between genetic properties of drosophila and correlation properties of the time series of its heartbeat activity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we describe the investigated system , recording of the time series and quantities used for their analysis . the analysis of the obtained fractal spectra is performed in sect.3 .",
    "some concluding remarcs are summarized in the last section .",
    "we investigate time series of the heart activity ( ecg ) of drosophila melanogaster obtained from mutant flies and wild type controls provided by bloomington drosophila stock center , u.s.a .",
    "we crossed male dopa decarboxilase ( ddc ) mutant ( fbgn 0000422 located in chromosome 2 , locus 37c1 ) and female shibire ( shi ) ( fbgn 0003392 located in chromosome 1 , locus 13f7 - 12 ) . the ddc mutants heartbeat rate is about 60 % of the normal one .",
    "ddc codes for an enzyme necessary for the synthesis of four neurotransmitters : norepinephrine , dopamine , octopamine , serotonin , related to learning and memory . the shibire ( shi ) mutants cause paralysis at high temperature .",
    "they code for the protein dynamin , necessary for the endocytosis .",
    "its damaging at high temperature stops the transmission of the impulse through the synapses , causes paralysis , and eliminates the effect of the neurotransmitters on the heart @xcite .",
    "ecgs were taken from three consequent generations of species .",
    "drosophila heartbeat was recorded optically and digitalized .",
    "optical ecg records were taken at a stage p1 ( white puparium ) of a drosophila development when it is both immobile and transparent and the dorsal vessel is easily viewed .",
    "the object was placed on a glass slide in a drop of distilled water under a microscope ( magnification 350 x ) .",
    "fluctuation in light intensity due to movement of the dorsal vessel tissue was captured by photocells fitted to the one eyepiece of the microscope .",
    "the captured analogue signal was then digitized at 1 khz sampling rate by data acquisition card and labview data capturing software supplied by national instruments .",
    "600000 data points were taken for each sample .",
    "the obtained time series are analysed by the multifractal formalism which is widely used in mathematics , physics , and biology @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the investigation is based on the spectrum @xmath1 of the local hurst exponent and on the fractal spectrum @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "let us consider a set of points which lies in an @xmath2dimensional cartesian space covered by a grid of @xmath3-dimensional cubes of edge length @xmath4 .",
    "if for small @xmath4 we need @xmath5 cubes to cover our set we can define the spectrum of generalized dimensions @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a continuous index .",
    "@xmath8 is the natural measure , i.e. , it is a measure of the frequency with which a typical orbit visits various cubes covering the investigated attracting set of points for the limit case when the length of the orbit goes to infinity ( in addition the frequences have to be the same for all initial conditions in the basin of attraction of the attractor except for a set with lebesque measure @xmath9 ) .",
    "thus for @xmath8 we have @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the time the orbit originating from @xmath12 spends in the cube @xmath13 in the time interval @xmath14 .",

    "first of all we have to calculate the profile function @xmath48 . for this we calculate the mean @xmath49 of the investigated time series @xmath50 and use it to obtain the profile function @xmath51 the following step is to divide the time series into segments and to calculate the variation for each segment .",

    "the procedure described above is appopriate for determination of positive hurst exponents which are not very close to zero . for close to zero or negative exponents we have to add a step after the calculation of the profile function namely to calculate the profile function of the profile function @xmath65 @xmath66\\ ] ] and the function @xmath67 should be used further in the mfdfa procedure .",
    "the result is that if there is a scaling in the fluctuation function this scaling is connected to the hurst exponent as @xmath68 in our investigation below we use mfdfa(1 ) i.e. the local trend for each segment is approximated by a straight line .",
