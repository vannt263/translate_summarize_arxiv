    "in the description of dynamical models of the @xmath0 system , the corresponding amplitude is determined as a solution of a scattering equation of the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) or lippman - schwinger type . the bs equation in relativistic studies",
    "is usually approximated by a covariant 3-dimensional quasi - potential ( qp ) reduction . in this framework one in principle has a lot of freedom , since there is no unique scheme for the choice of the equation .",
    "certainly , one would like to restrict this freedom not only by fitting to experimental data , some restrictions can come from various symmetries and consistency requirements , such as the correct low - energy limit , the correct one - body limit of the equation @xcite , etc .",
    "another consistency requirement is the symmetry of the renormalization of the positive and negative energy - states .",
    "we find that most of the relativistic qp equations used in practice do _ not _ satisfy this requirement , suggesting that relativistic covariance is violated in these qp formulations .",
    "one particular choice however , the _ equal - time _",
    "( et ) ( or instantaneous ) _ approximation_@xcite of the bs equation , does not suffer from this pathology .    in the next section we consider the self - energy calculation and",
    "demonstrate how the equivalence of the positive and negative energy - state renormalization can be destroyed .",
    "in section 3 we briefly present our model for pion - nucleon scattering based on the solution of the bs equation in the equal - time approximation .",
    "consider the dressed nucleon propagator given by s ( ) = ^-1 , where @xmath1 is the self - energy .",
    "relativistic covariance under general lorentz transformations requires that ( ) = a(p^2 )   + b(p^2 ) . in the c.m .",
    "frame @xmath2 the dirac structure of the self - energy simplifies to @xmath3 where @xmath4 .",
    "a similar decomposition holds for the propagator , s(p_0 ) = s^(+)(p_0)_+ + s^(-)(p_0 ) _ - , with @xmath5^{-1}$ ] .",
    "obviously , @xmath6 corresponds to the positive and @xmath7 to the negative energy - state propagations .",
    "since describes a relativistic spin 1/2 propagation , it has to have poles at @xmath8 with the same field renormalization constant @xmath9 .",
    "this implies that near these poles we have to satisfy the condition _",
    "r ( p_0 ) = _ -r ( -p_0 ) , r=1 .",
    "it is easy to see that is valid as long as the self - energy can be written in the covariant form .",
    "if does not hold , the positive and negative energy - states have different renormalized masses and the standard renormalization procedure@xcite breaks down .",
    "let us now study as a specific example the lowest order @xmath0 bubble self - energy graph .",
    "this occurs in the dynamical models under consideration .",
    "we have after the partial - wave decomposition : _",
    "r(p_0 ) = _ -^ _ 0^ ^2 _ g^()(,k_0;p_0)_r^()(,k_0;p_0 ) , where @xmath10 is the pion - nucleon propagator and @xmath11 represents the @xmath12 vertex contributions with @xmath13 characterizing the @xmath13-spin@xcite of the intermediate state . furthermore",
    ", the integration variable @xmath14 is the relative - energy variable , defined as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the 0-th component of the nucleon ( pion ) 4-momentum , and @xmath18    the singularities of @xmath11 in the @xmath14 plane are associated with those of the potential and the form factors . in the qp approximation , the @xmath14",
    "is usually taken to be constrained to a certain value , depending in general on the 3-momentum @xmath19 .",
    "considering the spectator qp approximation @xcite ( where only the contribution from either the pion or the nucleon pole is taken ) , we find the somewhat surprising result that condition is not satisfied .",
    "the breakdown essentially amounts to that the self - energy doesnot have the form .",
    "in particular , scalar invariants like @xmath20 and @xmath21 are in this approximation functions of not only @xmath22 , but also of @xmath23 .",
    "this signals also a violation of the charge conjugation symmetry .",
    "the same problem arises in the choices given by pearce and jennings@xcite .    removing the @xmath14 singularities ( by taking @xmath24 ) in the @xmath12 vertex functions",
    ", we may perform the @xmath14-integration explicitly by contour integration , leading essentially to the et - approximation .",
    "one can readily demonstrate that this choice of qp prescription does satisfy the above discussed symmetry property .",
    "we turn now to the discussion of our model for pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "we compute the amplitude by solving the bs equation in the et approximation .",
    "the potential we use is given by the tree diagrams in figure 1 .",
    "we thus include the @xmath25-channel @xmath26 and @xmath13(770 ) , and the @xmath27- and @xmath28-channel @xmath29(938 ) , @xmath30(1232 ) and the roper - resonance exchanges .",
    "the @xmath30 and the roper are widthless when included in the driving force , their one - pion - nucleon decay width is then generated dynamically in the calculation .",
    "note that , although the potential is crossing symmetric , the kernel of the equation and thus the resulting amplitude is not .",
    "the bare vertices and propagators are obtained from an effective lagrangian of the meson and the isobar fields , see ref.@xcite .",
    "we allow the pion field to couple only through a derivative coupling , which directly provides the correct low - energy limit , at least at the tree level .",
    "the rescattering can in principle violate the low - energy limit ( in our model this may come due to the lack of the crossing symmetry ) .",
    "we have checked numerically that these violations are small in our model .       for each particle",
    "we have used a form factor depending on the 4-momentum squared of the particle . for a meson",
    "we take the one boson exchange form factor , and for a baryon we use the form factor of pearce and jennings@xcite ( with @xmath31 ) .",
    "the corresponding cutoff masses and other model parameters which were fitted to the @xmath0 phase - shifts are presented in table 1 .    for the propagator of the @xmath30",
    "we use the rarita - schwinger propagator , and the @xmath32 coupling is taken to be of the general structure determined by a coupling constant @xmath33 and an off - shell parameter @xmath34 , cf .",
    "the @xmath13 exchange generates the conserved isovector - vector current .",
    "the strength of its coupling is rather close to that determined by the @xmath12 coupling constant through the kawarabayashi - suzuki relation ( @xmath35 which we use would imply @xmath36 ) .",
    "the @xmath13 thus mainly plays the role of the @xmath0 contact term required in the non - linear realizations of chiral symmetry .",
    "the @xmath26 meson is included so as to simulate the isoscalar - scalar contribution of the correlated two - pion exchange .",
    "therefore , for the @xmath37 coupling constant we take the sign determined in ref.@xcite , and we find that this choice is preferable for the proper description of the phase - shifts .",
    "using this model we are able to get a reasonable fit to the elastic @xmath0 phase - shifts , see figure 2 , with the parameters given in table 1 . to give a feeling about the size of the rescattering contributions in our model ,",
    "we also show ( dashed lines ) the results of the calculation where the principal part of the rescattering integrals is neglected ( the k - matrix approach ) .",
