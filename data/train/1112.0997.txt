    "one of the outstanding problems of the evolution of parton densities is the rapid increase of the number of gluons at low bjorken @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "such growth has to be tamed at some point .",
    "the scale at which this happens is called saturation scale @xmath2 and it depends on the bjorken @xmath1 .",
    "the explicit form of the saturation scale follows from the fact that @xmath3 is related to the gluon distribution in the proton at low @xmath1 @xcite:@xmath4 where @xmath5 gev and @xmath6 are free parameters whose precise values can be extracted from fits to the hera data .",
    "power @xmath7 is known to be of the order @xmath8 .",
    "based on the saturation idea golec - biernat and wsthoff proposed a model @xcite where the reduced cross - section @xmath9 is written as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an amplitude for photon dissociation into a @xmath12 pair of size @xmath13 , which is explicitly known , and @xmath14 is a model dipole - proton cross - section .",
    "there are two important features of @xmath14 that are incorporated in the gbw model .",
    "firstly , instead of taking @xmath14 to depend independently on @xmath13 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 cms energy ) it is assumed that @xmath14 depends on bjorken @xmath1 @xmath17 where @xmath18 stands for the proton mass .",
    "furthermore , in the gbw model @xmath14 depends on @xmath1 through the saturation scale @xmath2 ( [ defqsat ] ) , namely : @xmath19 given the fact that for massless quarks distribution amplitude @xmath11 is a function of a product of @xmath13 and @xmath20:@xmath21 it follows that@xmath22 a phenomenon known as geometrical scaling @xcite .",
    "let us finish this section by recalling that the dipole - proton cross - section @xmath14 is in the gbw model related to the unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath23 @xcite:@xmath24 where@xmath25 the fact that @xmath26 cross - section depends only on the combination @xmath27 implies that@xmath28 and strong coupling constant @xmath29 should be frozen .",
    "for pp collisons for low and moderate @xmath30 one uses gribov  levin ",
    "ryskin formula @xcite@xmath31 here @xmath32 are gluon momenta fractions @xmath33 needed to produce a gluon of transverse momentum @xmath30 and rapidity @xmath34 ( or pseudorapidity @xmath35 ) . unfortunately formula ( [ nchdef ] ) has been proven @xcite only for the scattering of a dilute system on a dense one ( _ i.e. _ @xmath36 or @xmath37 ) . despite that , one is often forced to use ( [ nchdef ] ) in a region of @xmath38 where numerical studies show that it still works reasonably well ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "if unintegrated gluon densities scale according to eq.([gsphi ] ) than also @xmath39 should scale ( provided we freeze @xmath29 and neglect possible energy dependence of constant @xmath40 ) . therefore geometrical scaling for the multiplicity distribution in pp collisions @xcite states that particle spectra depend on one scaling variable@xmath41 where @xmath42 is the saturation scale ( [ defqsat ] ) at @xmath38 ( [ x12 ] ) : @xmath43 where we have neglected rapidity dependence of @xmath32 .",
    "factor @xmath44 corresponds to the choice of the energy scale ( arbitrary at this moment @xmath45 in eq.([defqsat ] ) ) . hence @xmath46 with @xmath5 gev . here",
    "@xmath47 is a universal function of @xmath48 .    in order to examine the quality of geometrical scaling in pp collisions in ref.@xcite we have considered ratios @xmath49 @xmath50    here we shall discuss another way of establishing geometrical scaling , at least qualitatively .",
    "note that if at two different energies @xmath51 and @xmath52 multiplicity distributions are equal @xmath53 then this means that they correspond to the same value of variable @xmath54 ( [ taudef ] ) . as a consequence@xmath55 for constant @xmath7 .",
    "equation ( [ ptw ] ) implies@xmath56    ratios @xmath57 for pp non - single diffractive spectra measured by the cms @xcite collaboration at the lhc are plotted in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ptratios ] together with the straight horizontal lines corresponding to the r.h.s . of eq.([ratiospt ] ) for @xmath58 .",
    "we see approximate constancy of @xmath59 over the wide range of @xmath60 .",
    "a small rise of @xmath59 with decreasing @xmath60 corresponds to the residual @xmath30-dependence of the exponent @xmath7 @xcite .    .",

    "( [ ratiospt ] ) for @xmath58.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we would like to advertise this method as a simple way of looking for gs in the @xmath30 spectra in various reactions .",
    "an obvious advantage is that it is very easy to do : it requires only to interpolate one spectrum ( here we have done this for @xmath61 tev ) .",
    "an obvious disadvantage consists in the fact that it is very difficult to attribute sensible error to the ratios @xmath57 , so for quantitative purposes it is better to consider ratios @xmath49 .",
    "we have already briefly discussed the onset of gs in heavy ion collisions in ref .",
    "this work is still in progress . if gs in hi collisions holds then , analogously to equation ( [ ratiospt ] ) , we can form ratios of @xmath30 s corresponding to the same multiplicity ( in the same centrality class @xmath68 ) at two different energies @xmath69 . in what follows we will neglect possible dependence of the saturation scale upon participant density @xcite ( for review see ref .",

    "[ fig : ptratios ] we plot ratio @xmath71 for two centrality classes : 06 % and 4550 % , together with a line corresponding to @xmath58 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : ptratios ] we might conclude that geometrical scaling works well also in heavy ion collisions .",
    "more detailed studies show , however , that dependence of the saturation scale on the participant densities may be crucial for proper description of the data .",
    "in this note we have proposed a simple procedure to look for geometrical scaling in the @xmath72 spectra , namely to construct ratios of transverse momenta corresponding to the same multiplicity . based on this method",
    "one can qualitatively see gs in the cms spectra @xcite at the lhc energies and in hi collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "many aspects of gs require further studies .",
    "firstly , new data at higher energies ( to come ) have to be examined . secondly , more detailed analysis including identified particles and rapidity dependence has to be performed . on theoretical side the universal shape @xmath47 has to be found and its connection to the unintegrated gluon distribution has to be studied . that will finally lead to perhaps the most difficult part , namely to the breaking of gs in pp .",
    "even more work is needed to understand gs quantitatively for hi collisions . here",
    "the main question arises why hydrodynamic evolution preserves gs over a time of a few fermi until the final state particles are produced .",
    "moreover , the behavior with energy of transverse participant densities for different centralities and for different rapidity regions require further studies . and finally @xmath73 dependence of the saturation scale has to be confirmed . here the new lhc data for different energies and different nuclei will open a new chapter , since the lhc energies are order of magnitude higher than those of rhic .",
