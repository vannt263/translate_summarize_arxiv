    "the antiferromagnetic ising model on the triangular lattice can be considered as the prototype of frustrated lattice models .",
    "it is defined by the ( reduced ) hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the antiferromagnetic interaction , @xmath2 is the reduced uniform magnetic field and @xmath3 is an ising spin at site @xmath4 , which can take the values @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the former sum runs over nearest neighbor ( nn ) pairs and the latter runs over all lattice sites . in zero field the ground state of the model is highly frustrated since the minimization of bond energies would require that all pairs of nn spins are antiparallel , but this condition can not be fulfilled even on a simple triangle . on the contrary ,",
    "six out of the eight possible configurations of a triangular plaquette ( that is , all except the two fully parallel ones ) are selected as the lowest energy ones , and this yields a huge degeneracy of the global ground state . in zero field ,",
    "the model has been solved exactly  @xcite and the solution shows that the disordered phase is stable down to zero temperature and the zero temperature entropy per site ( in the thermodynamic limit ) is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of sites and @xmath9 is the boltzmann constant .    although an exact solution is available , a lot of work has focused on mean - field approximations , since the present model can be viewed as a playground for testing approximate methods against exact results before applying them to more general and difficult models .",
    "the usual ( single site ) mean - field approximation fails qualitatively to predict the zero field behavior of the model : the disordered phase is thermodynamically stable only down to a certain transition temperature , below which one finds a three - sublattice ordered phase .",
    "also the more sophisticated cluster variation method ( cvm ) @xcite gives the same qualitative picture , although with a lower transition temperature , which decreases upon increasing the cluster size .",
    "an interesting approach , which seems to display a qualitatively correct behavior , is the hard - spin mean - field ( hsmf ) theory by berker and coworkers @xcite , although quantities like entropy and free energy are to be calculated according to recipes which are not very well defined  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a new investigation based on the bethe - peierls ( bp ) approximation has been recently carried out by tamashiro and salinas  @xcite : the authors claim that this approximation predicts a paramagnetic phase which in zero magnetic field is stable down to zero temperature .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold : we shall first show that the paramagnetic phase found by tamashiro and salinas  @xcite is unphysical at low temperatures , by explicitly calculating the entropy , which turns out to be negative ; then we shall address the more general issue of analyzing carefully the other approximations , with a particular attention to the zero field , zero temperature case . in the case of the cvm we shall show that the zero field , zero temperature entropy of the disordered phase converges , for increasing cluster size , to the exact value according to a power law , while the critical temperature converges very slowly to the exact value of zero ; furthermore we shall shortly discuss a cvm approximation which does not predict a spurious transition in zero field . in the case of the hsmf theory",
    "we shall give a well - defined recipe to calculate the free energy and the entropy and use it to evaluate the zero field , zero temperature entropy .",
    "the bp approximation  @xcite has long been used to improve upon the ordinary mean - field results .",
    "it is the simplest mean - field like approximation which takes into account two - site correlations .",
    "recently , tamashiro and salinas  @xcite applied the bp approximation to the present model , splitting the triangular lattice in the natural way into its three sublattices .",
    "they report that in the case of vanishing magnetic field the disordered ( paramagnetic ) phase is stable down to zero temperature .",
    "this is actually what the approximation predicts , but a deeper analysis is in order to understand what kind of disordered phase we are talking of at low temperature .",
    "since in the next section we are going to discuss the cvm , it is worth mentioning that the cvm itself reduces , if one chooses a nn pair as the maximal cluster , to the bp approximation .",
    "let us consider the reduced entropy density @xmath10 given by the cvm for the triangular lattice with the assumption of three non equivalent sublattices ( say @xmath11 ) and the above choice of basic clusters ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath12   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{5}{3 }             \\left [ { \\rm tr}(\\rho_{a } \\ln \\rho_{a } ) +                    { \\rm tr}(\\rho_{b } \\ln \\rho_{b } ) +                    { \\rm tr}(\\rho_{c } \\ln \\rho_{c } ) \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath13 is the nn pair density matrix ( which is diagonal since we are dealing with a classical model ) and its diagonal elements @xmath14 represent the probability of finding the nn spins belonging to the sublattices @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the states @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "similarly @xmath19 is the reduced ( single site ) density matrix , whose diagonal elements @xmath20 represent the probability of finding a spin belonging to the sublattice @xmath15 in the state @xmath17 . rewriting these probabilities in terms of the magnetizations @xmath21 and",
    "the nn pair correlations @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote nn spin variables on the sublattices @xmath15 and @xmath25 , respectively and as usual @xmath26 denotes thermal average ) one obtains @xmath27 where the outer sum runs over sublattice pairs ( @xmath28 ) in the former term , over sublattices ( @xmath29 ) in the latter and we have defined @xmath30 . the ( reduced ) internal energy density ( which more rigorously we shall refer to as an enthalpy ) @xmath31 can be written exactly as @xmath32 the minimization of the ( reduced ) free energy density @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the absolute temperature ) with respect to the magnetizations and the nn correlations can then be performed .",
    "we introduce the conditioned average of a spin ( on sublattice @xmath15 ) with respect to its nn ( on sublattice @xmath25 ) @xmath36 which is related to the previous variables by the identity : @xmath37 the stationarity conditions for @xmath38 can thus be written as @xmath39 where the sum involves two sublattices only ( for instance , if @xmath40 then @xmath41 ) . if the following quantity is defined @xmath42 ( being as usual @xmath43 ) , the equations [ derivate_c ] become @xmath44 substituting into eq .",

    "if @xmath57 then the magnetization ( and hence the local effective field ) of the paramagnetic phase vanish , which corresponds to taking @xmath60 in eq .",
    "24 of ref .  .",
    "in this case the free energy reduces to ( using @xmath61 ) @xmath62 where the @xmath63 asymptotic expression clearly agrees with our previous discussion .",
    "a couple of comments on these results are in order .",
    "a pair correlation equal to @xmath6 means that _ every _ pair of nn spins is , in the ground state , in an antiparallel state .",
    "this is of course not possible , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the bp approximation , taking into account only nn pairs and single sites , completely neglects frustration effects and predicts an internal energy ( and hence , at low enough temperatures , a free energy ) which is much lower than the exact one , @xmath64 @xcite thus `` stabilizing '' the disordered phase .",
    "we note in passing that the bp approximation usually gives a free energy which is an upper bound to the exact one .",
    "it is clear that the state which is predicted to be the ground state can not exist , and this is reflected in the _ negative _ value of the zero temperature entropy .",
    "of course , such unphysical effects will not be limited to the point @xmath65 , but will be found in a finite region of the phase diagram around this point . in order to give an idea of the size of this region we only mention that the zero field entropy vanishes at a temperature @xmath66 , and is negative below this temperature .",
    "another , more stringent , criterion , can be based on the nn correlation @xmath51 : a nn pair probability distribution can be obtained by partial trace from a triangle probability distribution only if @xmath67 . in the bp approximation @xmath68 in the ground state and @xmath69 at a temperature @xmath70 .",
    "below such a temperature the bp results are certainly unphysical , since they predict a nn pair probability distribution which can not exist in a triangular lattice . in fig . [",
