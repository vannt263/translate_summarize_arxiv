    "recent experimental progress at @xmath4 factories suggests that precise computation of hadronic matrix elements in lattice qcd is a key to the search for signals of new physics in flavor physics .",
    "however , the two major formalisms for the heavy quark , _ i.e. _ hqet approaches or the relativistic approaches to describe the heavy quarks on the lattice still suffer from perturbative and/or discretization errors , which are typically @xmath5 10% .",
    "we therefore need yet another formalism of the heavy quark for the precise and systematic computation of matrix elements .",
    "ideally , in such a formalism , one should be able to ( i ) take the continuum limit , ( ii ) compute the parameters in the action and the operators nonperturbatively , ( iii ) and compute matrix elements with a modest computational cost .    as a candidate of framework which fulfills these conditions",
    ", we investigate the anisotropic lattice with the temporal lattice spacing @xmath6 finer than the spatial one @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "anisotropic lattice framework evidently satisfies above conditions ( i ) and ( iii ) .",
    "our expectation is that on anisotropic lattices the mass dependence of the parameters becomes so mild that one can adopt coefficients determined nonperturbatively at massless limit .",
    "whether these promises will be practically satisfied should be examined numerically .    as a first step toward this goal , we study the action which is nonperturbatively tuned only for the leading term , while @xmath0 improvement terms are tuned at the tadpole tree level . we measure the heavy - light meson dispersion relation with the anisotropy parameter tuned at the massless limit .",
    "we can then study the breaking of relativity condition as a function of the heavy quark mass , with which we can test if the small mass dependence of the parameter really holds .",
    "our heavy quark formalism basically follows the fermilab approach @xcite but is formulated on the anisotropic lattice  @xcite .",
    "the quark action is represented as @xmath8   \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\hspace{-0.2 cm }      -   \\kappa_{\\sigma } { \\textstyle \\sum_{i } }           \\left [ \\ \\ ( r-\\gamma_i ) u_i(x ) \\delta_{x+\\hat{i},y } \\right .",

    ", we set the spatial wilson parameter as @xmath16 and the clover coefficients as the tadpole - improved tree - level values as @xmath17 , @xmath18 and perform a nonperturbative calibration only for @xmath19 .",
    "the tadpole improvement @xcite is achieved by rescaling the link variables as @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with the mean - field values of the spatial and temporal link variables , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "this is equivalent to redefining the hopping parameters with the tadpole - improved ones ( with tilde ) through @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we define the anisotropy parameter @xmath19 as @xmath26 .    for convenience ,",
    "we also introduce @xmath27 as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the bare quark mass in temporal lattice units .",
    "@xmath19 is the bare anisotropy parameter , which should be tuned so that the physical fermionic anisotropy @xmath30 retains the same value as that of the gauge field , @xmath31 . for the quenched case , as for the present work , one can first calibrate the anisotropy parameter of gauge field separately from the quark field , and then tune @xmath19 so that @xmath32 holds .",
    "the calibration of bare anisotropy @xmath19 was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite using the dispersion relation of mesons for quark masses less than the charm quark mass region , on quenched lattices with @xmath2 for three different lattice spacings .",
    "the quark mass dependence is indeed mild and well represented by a linear form in @xmath33 .",
    "we next study whether the relativistic dispersion relation holds for the heavy - light mesons with @xmath19 tuned for the massless quark @xcite . in general , the lattice dispersion relation for arbitrary values of @xmath19 is described as @xmath34 where the energy @xmath35 and the rest mass @xmath36 are in temporal lattice units while the momentum @xmath37 is in spatial units .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 in this equation defines the anisotropy of the quark fields , whose difference with the gauge field anisotropy @xmath38 probes the breaking of relativity .",
    "numerical simulations are performed on a quenched lattice of the size @xmath39 generated with the wilson plaquette action at @xmath40 for @xmath2 , which is realized by taking the bare anisotropy of gauge field @xmath41 using the numerical formula determined by klassen in one percent accuracy @xcite . the lattice cutoff defined through the hadronic radius @xmath42 is @xmath43 gev .",
    "other details of parameters such as the mean - field values are found in refs .",

    "the result for the pseudoscalar meson is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : xi_f ] .",
    "similar result is obtained for the vector channel .",
    "the measured value @xmath30 for the heavy - light meson coincides with @xmath38 in the quark mass region @xmath44 ( in temporal lattice units ) within 2% accuracy .",
    "( this accuracy is just a guide for argument of uncertainty in this paper . ) therefore , for the range of quark mass @xmath44 which covers the charm quark mass with present lattice cutoff , our quark action with the bare anisotropy tuned for massless quark can successfully describe the heavy - light meson with controlled systematic uncertainty .",
    "we also show the @xmath30 of the heavy quarkonium . in this case",
    ", @xmath30 rapidly increases because of large momentum transfer inside heavy quarkonium , @xmath45 , in contrast to the case of heavy - light systems , where @xmath46 .",
    "the result in the previous section tells us that the framework can be applied to charmed heavy - light meson systems . as a first application , we compute the heavy - light decay constants .",
    "numerical simulations are performed on two quenched lattices at @xmath47 and @xmath48 with the renormalized anisotropy @xmath2 .",
    "the former is the same as in previous section , and the latter has spatial cutoff @xmath49 gev . for the light quark",
    ", we use three values of the hopping parameter @xmath27 which cover the range of quark masses from @xmath50 to 1.5 @xmath50 .",
    "the chiral limit is taken by a linear extrapolation .",
    "the matching to the continuum theory is at the tadpole improved tree level .",
    "the result at @xmath51 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : decayconst ] . in this analysis",
    ", the physical quark masses are defined through the lattice cutoff defined with the @xmath52 meson mass .",
    "we find that the behavior of @xmath53 is consistent with the results on isotropic lattices .",
    "since the currents are matched only at the tadpole tree level and the @xmath0 improvement terms are tuned also only at the tadpole tree level , the present calculation contains rather large renormalization uncertainty as well as the cutoff dependence . in order to suppress these errors",
    "we compute the ratio of decay constants .",
    "our preliminary results are @xmath54 which are consistent with previous works on isotropic lattices @xcite .",
    "a remarkable point is that the lattice spacing dependence of the ratio is small .",
    "in fact , individual decay constants could suffer from both the mass independent and mass dependent errors , but the former can largely cancel in the ratio . therefore , the stability of the ratio may be an indication that the mass dependent errors are suppressed in our formalism on anisotropic lattices as expected .    in conclusion , the results of numerical simulations in quenched lattices are encouraging for further development in this direction .",
    "further improvements , such as nonperturbative tuning of the clover coefficients , are necessary for achieving the desired accuracy .",
