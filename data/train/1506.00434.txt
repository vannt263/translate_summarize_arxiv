    "the swimming of fish and the flying of birds continue to pose challenging theoretical problems .",
    "the physics of bird flight was first studied in detail by otto lilienthal in the nineteenth century @xcite . since then",
    ", significant progress has been made in many years of dedicated research @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the goal of theory is to calculate the time - averaged speed and power for given periodic shape variations of the body , at least for a simple model system .",
    "it is assumed that the motion of the fluid is well described by the navier - stokes equations for an incompressible viscous fluid . on average over a period the force exerted by the body on the fluid vanishes , so that thrust and drag cancel . in early work by lighthill @xcite and wu @xcite",
    "the thrust and power were calculated approximately as functions of the speed on the basis of potential flow theory for a planar strip .",
    "this work and subsequent developments have been reviewed by childress @xcite , by wu @xcite,@xcite , and by sparenberg @xcite .",
    "however , an independent calculation of the mean speed for given periodic shape variations is still lacking .",
    "measurement of the power consumption has led to a surprisingly small friction coefficient , much smaller than that of an inert body , as was first observed by gray @xcite .",
    "it was first shown by taylor @xcite that in the slow swimming of a microorganism the calculation of thrust can be circumvented . in this limiting case one can use the time - independent stokes equations .",
    "the mean swimming velocity and mean rate of dissipation then follow from a purely kinematic calculation @xcite,@xcite . for small amplitude swimming both quantities",
    "are quadratic in the amplitude of the stroke to lowest order . for a simple system , where the body is modeled as an assembly of rigid spheres held together by direct interaction forces and subject to periodic actuating forces which sum to zero",
    ", we have shown that in the high viscosity limit the swimming velocity and power can be calculated for any amplitude of stroke from kinematics alone @xcite,@xcite .    in the following we investigate questions of thrust , velocity , and power for swimming or flying in a fluid of any viscosity , including the limit of low viscosity , for the same mechanical model as before .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the spheres experience stokes friction .",
    "in addition we incorporate hydrodynamic interactions via virtual mass effects , as found from potential flow theory .",
    "we use hamilton s equations of motion with added damping terms . in the limit of high viscosity , where resistive forces dominate ,",
    "the earlier results are recovered .",
    "the model provides valuable insight also in the limit of low viscosity , where reactive forces dominate . in that regime",
    "the motion is dominated by virtual mass effects .",
    "bernoulli forces and modified linear friction should be taken into account in a more realistic model .",
    "nonetheless , the principle of the calculation , which exploits elimination of the fluid degrees of freedom , remains valid .",
    "the flow is assumed to be laminar at all times .",
    "it is now realized that the boundary layer of swimming fish is laminar even at high reynolds number @xcite .",
    "virtual mass effects were discussed earlier by lighthill @xcite .",
    "the numerical modeling of animal swimming and flight was reviewed by deng et al .",
    "@xcite .    as an example",
    "a system of three equal spheres moving along a common axis is studied . for",
    "this simple system the mean swimming speed and mean power to second order in the amplitude of stroke can be evaluated analytically .",
    "the solution to a corresponding eigenvalue problem provides the optimal stroke to this order , as we found elsewhere in the resistive regime @xcite .",
    "in our model the mean thrust , i.e. the frictional force exerted on the fluid averaged over a period in periodic swimming , vanishes identically .",
    "we find that the velocity of the geometric center of the assembly is driven by a different force , which we call the impetus .",
    "it has both a reactive and a resistive component .",
    "the impetus determines the center velocity with retardation .",
    "the mean impetus does not vanish .",
    "it is known for small amplitude swimming in the resistive regime that the mean power is directly proportional to the mean velocity .",
    "we find for our example that the relation between mean power and mean velocity is nearly linear also for large amplitude swimming .",
    "presumably the near linearity holds also for other systems in the whole regime of viscosity .",
    "if true , this would resolve the so - called gray paradox @xcite , which is based on the mistaken notion that the power is quadratic in the velocity , as in stokes friction .",
    "we consider a set of @xmath0 rigid spheres of radii @xmath1 and masses @xmath2 , centered at positions @xmath3 , and immersed in an incompressible viscous fluid of shear viscosity @xmath4 and mass density @xmath5 .",
    "the fluid is of infinite extent in all directions .",
    "the flow velocity @xmath6 and pressure @xmath7 of the fluid are assumed to satisfy the navier - stokes equations @xmath8=\\eta\\nabla^2{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ v$}}-\\nabla p,\\qquad\\nabla\\cdot{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ v$}}=0.\\ ] ] the flow velocity @xmath9 is assumed to satisfy the no - slip boundary condition on the surface of the spheres .",
    "the fluid is set in motion by time - dependent motions of the spheres . at each time @xmath10",
    "the velocity field @xmath6 tends to zero at infinity , and the pressure @xmath7 tends to the constant ambient pressure @xmath11 .    as the spheres move in the fluid they experience a frictional force .",
    "in addition there may be applied forces @xmath12 and direct interaction forces which depend on the relative positions @xmath13 of sphere centers .",
    "we shall assume that the sum of applied forces vanishes , so that @xmath14 the sum of direct interaction forces vanishes owing to newton s third law .",
    "we assume that the frictional forces are linear in the sphere velocities , as given by low reynolds number hydrodynamics on the slow timescale @xcite .",
    "the spheres are freely rotating so that there are no frictional torques .",
    "the forces exerted by pressure gradients resist instantaneous acceleration and give rise to virtual mass effects @xcite .",
    "for a single sphere @xmath15 immersed in infinite fluid the virtual mass would be @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mass of fluid displaced by the sphere .",
    "the virtual mass effect for a collection of @xmath0 spheres is embodied in a @xmath18-dimensional mass matrix @xmath19 .",
    "this can be derived from potential flow theory by considering the irrotational flow pattern generated instantaneously by a set of sudden impulses @xmath20 from a state of rest .",
    "the total corresponding kinetic energy is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the set of sphere velocities .",
    "the kinetic energy is a sum of two contributions , @xmath23 , with @xmath24 where the integration is over the part of space occupied by fluid and @xmath25 is the velocity potential corresponding to the set of instantaneous velocities @xmath26 .",
    "the potential @xmath25 is linear in the sphere velocities @xmath22 , so that the kinetic energy @xmath27 is a quadratic form in @xmath26 .",
    "the contribution @xmath27 to the total kinetic energy defines the virtual mass .",
    "this depends parametrically on the positions @xmath28 , leading to corresponding hydrodynamic interactions .    besides the mass matrix @xmath19 it will be useful to define also the mobility matrix @xmath29 , the friction matrix @xmath30 , and the inverse mass matrix @xmath31 , @xmath32 the four matrices are symmetric and depend on the relative positions of the sphere centers .",
    "the sphere momenta , including the virtual mass contribution , are given by @xmath33 correspondingly we postulate the equations of motion @xmath34 where @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the potential of direct interaction forces .",
    "the partial derivative @xmath38 is taken at constant momenta @xmath39 .",
    "it is clear that the equations of motion ( 2.7 ) have only limited validity .",
    "the frictional forces are assumed to be linear in the sphere velocities , and basset memory forces are neglected .",
    "nonetheless it is of interest to explore the consequences of the equations as they stand .",
    "we note that it follows from eq .",
    "( 2.7 ) that total dressed sphere momentum @xmath40 is not conserved but changes due to friction with the fluid .",
    "if an impulse @xmath41 is imparted at time @xmath42 to the spheres in a state of rest due to applied forces @xmath43 , then part of the momentum is transferred instantaneously to the fluid , reducing the sphere velocities to @xmath44 , as can be seen by integration over an infinitesimal time interval about @xmath42 and use of eq .",
    "the remaining momentum of the spheres is transferred to the fluid in the course of time by friction .",
    "the total momentum of spheres and fluid is conserved at all times .",
    "we are looking for a solution of the equations of motion where the center of the assembly moves on average with uniform translational velocity and the individual spheres perform periodic motions about the moving center .",

    "we choose initial conditions corresponding to the rest configuration @xmath269    the kinetic energy term in eq .",
    "( 2.7 ) makes the direct numerical solution of the equations of motion time - consuming .",
    "instead we use an iterative procedure , neglecting the kinetic energy term in first approximation .",
    "then the equations can be solved by a fast procedure . from the solution the kinetic forces , defined as @xmath270",
    ", can be calculated as a function of time . in the next step",
    "we include the kinetic forces and repeat the procedure .",
    "the kinetic forces are small compared to the actuating forces and the solution converges after a few iterations .    in fig .",
    "9 we show the numerical solution of the equations of motion eqs .",
    "( 2.6 ) and ( 2.7 ) with forces given by eq .",
    "( 8.4 ) for @xmath228 , viscosity @xmath241 , stiffness @xmath271 , and amplitude factor @xmath272 for the first fifty periods . in fig .",
    "10 we show the mean value of the kinetic energy for successive periods .",
    "the orbit for the last period hardly differs from the ellipse given by eq .",
    "( 8.3 ) , as shown in fig . 11 .",
    "the mean swimming velocity and the mean rate of dissipation can be calculated as time - averages over the last period .",
    "the efficiency is @xmath273 , equal to the value calculated from the periodic orbit by use of eq .",
    "( 3.8 ) for displacements @xmath243 with @xmath272 , shown in fig .",
    "in general the performance of a swimmer or flyer can be measured in terms of the dimensionless efficiency @xmath274 , defined as the ratio @xmath275 where @xmath159 is a conveniently chosen length scale , @xmath245 is the mean speed and @xmath276 is the mean power , averaged over a period @xmath112 .",
    "we note that the lower bound of the efficiency @xmath274 vanishes , since for a periodic motion in relative phase space which is time - reversible the mean swimming velocity vanishes .",
    "a striking result of the present analysis is that for the simple three - sphere model , for which analytic calculations can be performed , the maximum efficiency @xmath277 is nearly independent of the dimensionless viscosity @xmath278 , as shown in fig . 1 ,",
    "( 5.10 ) . as a consequence",
    "the mean speed is nearly inversely proportional to the shear viscosity @xmath4 for given power .",
    "we expect that this is a general feature of the mechanical system defined by equations of motion of the type eq .",
    "( 2.7 ) with hydrodynamic interactions as detailed in sec .",
    "this explains the great advantage that birds in air have over fish in water .",
    "a second result of the analysis is that the mean power is equal to the mean rate of dissipation , as shown in sec .",
    "there is no additional energy loss related to the rate of change of the virtual mass .",
    "the mean speed and mean power can be evaluated for more sophisticated model swimmers or flyers by similar analysis .",
    "elsewhere we studied longer chains with both longitudinal and transverse excitation in the resistive limit @xcite .",
    "that analysis can be extended to the full range of viscosity , based on the equations of motion eqs .",
    "( 2.6 ) and ( 2.7 ) .    for assumed periodic displacements",
    "the velocity of the assembly can be derived from the equation of motion eq .",
    "( 3.8 ) by decomposition in harmonics , as demonstrated in the three - sphere model .",
    "the mean power is found as a collateral of the calculation .",
    "the full range of viscosity is covered , so that the analysis provides an interesting link between the flying of birds , the swimming of fish , and the swimming of bacteria .",
