    "<S> this includes challenges for auxiliary heating and current drive by the use of radio frequency waves @xcite and enhanced material erosion of the main chamber walls @xcite , and is likely related to the empirical discharge density limit @xcite . at the outboard mid - plane scrape - off layer </S>",
    "<S> the radial transport is predominantly due to radially outwards motion of blob - like plasma filaments , which leads to order unity relative fluctuation levels , broad plasma profiles and enhanced plasma  wall interactions @xcite .    the statistical properties of plasma fluctuations in the scrape - off layer </S>",

    "<S> based on this , a stochastic model of the plasma fluctuations has been developed @xcite and its underlying assumptions and predictions are found to compare favorably with experimental measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , analytical expressions for the rate of level crossings were obtained from this model , that is , how frequently a realization of the process on average crosses a given threshold level . </S>",
    "<S> this gives novel predictions of threshold phenomena underlying plasma  wall interactions due to transient transport events @xcite .    in this contribution , </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations in the boundary region of the alcator c - mod tokamak are investigated by analysis of gas puff imaging measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the present work may be considered as a continuation of the first studies of these measurement data published in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> a major new finding is that the frequency power spectral density is similar for all radial positions and line - averaged densities . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum agrees with the model prediction , implying that the temporal scale of the fluctuations is the same , while the degree of pulse overlap decreases radially outwards . </S>",
    "<S> predictions of level crossing rates are also found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental measurements . </S>",

    "<S> an on - axis toroidal magnetic field of @xmath10 was used . </S>",
    "<S> the condition at the outer divertor target goes from sheath limited at the lowest density to high recycling at the highest density in this density scan , and the particle density profile at the outboard mid - plane develops the familiar two - layer structure and significant broadening with increasing line - averaged density . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments were part of heat flux footprint studies on alcator c - mod , and have been extensively diagnosed and documented @xcite .    the gas puff imaging diagnostic consists of a @xmath11 ( radial@xmath12vertical ) toroidal views , coupled to an in - vessel optical fiber array . the plasma emission collected in the views </S>",
    "<S> is filtered for he i ( @xmath13 nm ) line emission that is due almost entirely to plasma excitation near the object plane of an extended he gas puff from a nearby nozzle . </S>",
    "<S> the fibres are coupled to high sensitivity avalanche photo diodes and the signals are digitized at a rate of @xmath14 frames per second . </S>",
    "<S> the in - focus spot size is @xmath15 for each of the individual fibre channels . the radial position of the last closed magnetic flux surface at the vertical centre of the image , @xmath16 , is in the range from @xmath17 to @xmath18 for all the discharges presented here . </S>",

    "<S> all time series are rescaled such as to have vanishing mean and unit standard deviation.,width=377 ]    excitation of neutral he gas , and thus the intensity of the gas puff imaging signals , is determined by the neutral he particle density and a combination of the local electron density and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this diagnostic does therefore not give information about the absolute value of any plasma parameters but is rather a proxy for the relative plasma fluctuation level . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , the measurement data for each diode view position is here rescaled such as to have vanishing mean and unit standard deviation . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a measured signal @xmath21 is normalized as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the moving average and standard deviation taken over a window of @xmath25 duration in order to remove low - frequency oscillations and trends in the signals . </S>",
    "<S> previous analysis of langmuir probe data have demonstrated that the statistical properties of the ion saturation current fluctuations in the far scrape - off layer are the same as that inferred from gas puff imaging data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the major advantage of the gas puff imaging diagnostic for these studies is the access to long fluctuation data time series for several radial positions in the scrape - off layer @xcite .    as a representative example of the plasma fluctuations in the boundary region , gas puff imaging signals recorded at three different radial positions for @xmath16 and @xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : traw ] . </S>",
    "<S> the innermost diode view position shown here at @xmath27 is close to the separatrix and the outermost position at @xmath28 is in the limiter shadow where the magnetic field lines intersect limiter structures and have a connection length of the order of @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly seen that the time series from the scrape - off layer are dominated by large - amplitude bursts , attributed to the radially outwards motion of blob - like plasma filaments . </S>",
    "<S> further inward , pulses appear more frequently and at the separatrix the signal resembles random noise . </S>",
    "<S> however , the following analysis suggests that the underlying pulse structure and temporal scale are the same for all these time series , the only difference being the degree of pulse overlap .    consider a stochastic process given by the super - position of a random sequence of @xmath30 pulses in a time interval of duration @xmath31 @xcite , @xmath32 where for each event @xmath33 the pulse amplitude is @xmath34 and the pulse arrival time is @xmath35 , the latter assumed to be uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath36 $ ] . the pulse shape is taken to be the same for all events and described by a two - sided exponential function @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the pulse duration and @xmath39 is a pulse shape asymmetry parameter restricted to the range @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath41 the pulse function has a shorter rise than fall time .    in agreement with previous measurements on several tokamak experiments , </S>",
    "<S> it is in the following assumed that the pulse amplitudes are exponentially distributed with mean value @xmath42 and the waiting times between the pulses are exponentially distributed with mean value @xmath43 @xcite . introducing the scaled variable @xmath44 with zero mean and unit standard deviation , similar to the experimental signals discussed above , the stationary probability density function for the random variable @xmath45 is a gamma distribution , giving @xmath46 the distribution @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the gamma function . here </S>",
    "<S> the shape parameter @xmath49 determines the degree of pulse overlap . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that since @xmath50 it follows that @xmath51 . the mean value of the signal given by eq .   </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath52 , the standard deviation is @xmath53 , and the skewness and flatness moments are @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , there is a parabolic relation between the skewness and flatness moments given by @xmath56 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> like the relative fluctuation level given by @xmath57 , also the skewness and flatness moments increase with decreasing @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath58 of pulse duration and waiting times is thus referred to as the _ intermittency parameter _ of the model . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath58 is small , pulses generally appear isolated in realizations of the process , resulting in a strongly intermittent signal . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath58 is large , there is significant overlap of pulses and realizations of the process resemble random noise and the probability density approaches as normal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the pulse asymmetry parameter @xmath39 does not enter the probability density function in eq .   or any of its moments .    </S>",
    "<S> in the case of the two - sided exponential pulse shape given by eq .  , the frequency power spectral density can readily be calculated @xcite , @xmath59\\left [ 1+\\lambda^2({\\ensuremath{\\tau_\\text{d}}}\\omega)^2 \\right ] } , \\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the angular frequency . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the spectrum is flat for low frequencies and has a steep power law shape for high frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the intermittency parameter @xmath58 does not influence the shape of the power spectral density , it is determined only by the pulse shape given in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the number of up - crossings @xmath61 of a given threshold level @xmath46 can be calculated in closed form for this stochastic process @xcite @xmath62 here it should be noted that the pulse asymmetry parameter @xmath39 only appears in the pre - factor and therefore does not influence the functional form of the level crossing rate . </S>",
    "<S> the number of level crossings is evidently proportional to the duration @xmath31 of the process and is inversely proportional to the pulse duration time @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of level crossings is highest for thresholds close to the mean value of the process . in the normal regime , @xmath63 </S>",
    "<S> , there are few crossings for threshold levels much smaller or much larger than the mean value due to the low probability of large - amplitude fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of level crossings is therefore a narrow gaussian function in this limit . in the strong intermittency regime , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath64 , the signal spends most of the time close to zero value , and virtually any pulse arrival will give rise to a level crossing for finite threshold values . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of level crossings therefore approaches a step function in this limit @xcite .    </S>",
