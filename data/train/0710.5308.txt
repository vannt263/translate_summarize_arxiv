    "in a microscopic description of a rarefied gas , all particles are assumed to be traveling in a straight line with a fixed velocity until they enter into a collision . in such dilute flows , binary collisions",
    "are often assumed to be the main mechanism of particle interactions .",
    "the statistical effect of such collisions can be modeled by collision terms of the boltzmann or enskog transport equation type , where the kinetic dynamics of the gas are subject to the molecular chaos assumption .",
    "the nature of these interactions could be elastic , inelastic or coalescing .",
    "they could either be isotropic or anisotropic , depending on their collision rates as a function of the scattering angle .",
    "in addition , collisions are described in terms of inter - particle potentials and the rate of collisions is usually modeled as product of power laws for the relative speed and the differential cross section , at the time of the interaction . when the rate of collisions is independent of the relative speed , the interaction is referred to as of maxwell type .",
    "when it corresponds to relative speed to a positive power less than unity , they are referred to as variable hard potentials ( vhp ) and when the rate of collisions is proportional to the relative speed , it is referred to as hard spheres . +   + the boltzmann transport equation ( an integro - differential transport equation ) describes the evolution of a single point probability distribution function @xmath1 which is defined as the probability of finding a particle at position @xmath2 with velocity ( kinetic ) @xmath3 at time @xmath4 .",
    "the mathematical and computational difficulties associated to the boltzmann equation are due to the non local - non linear nature of the collision operator , which is usually modeled as a multi linear integral form in @xmath5-dimensional velocity space and unit sphere @xmath6 .",
    "+   + from the computational point of view , of the well - known and well - studied methods developed in order to solve this equation is an stochastic based method called `` direct simulation monte - carlo '' ( dsmc ) developed initially by bird  @xcite and nanbu  @xcite and more recently by @xcite .",
    "this method is usually employed as an alternative to hydrodynamic solvers to model the evolution of moments or hydrodynamic quantities . in particular , this method have been shown to converge to the solution of the classical boltzmann equation in the case of mono atomic rarefied gases @xcite .",
    "one of the main drawbacks of such methods is the inherent statistical fluctuations in the numerical results , which becomes very expensive or unreliable in presence of non - stationary flows or non equilibrium statistical states , where more information is desired about the evolving probability distribution .",
    "currently , there is extensive work from rjasanow and wagner @xcite and references therein , to determine accurately the high - velocity tail behavior of the distribution functions from dsmc data .",
    "implementations for micro irreversible interactions such as inelastic collisions have been carefully studied in @xcite",
    ". +   + in contrast , a deterministic method computes approximations of the probability distribution function using the boltzmann equation , as well as approximations to the observables like density , momentum , energy , etc . , .",
    "there are currently two deterministic approaches to the computations of non - linear boltzmann , one is the well known discrete velocity models and the second a spectral based method , both implemented for simulations of elastic interactions i.e. energy conservative evolution .",
    "discrete velocity models were developed by broadwell @xcite and mathematically studied by illner , cabannes , kawashima among many authors @xcite .",
    "more recently these models have been studied for many other applications on kinetic elastic theory in @xcite .",
    "these models have not adapted to inelastic collisional problems up to this point according to our best knowledge .",
    "+   + spectral based models , which are the ones of our choice in this work , have been developed by pareschi , gabetta and toscani @xcite , and later by bobylev and rjasanow  @xcite and pareschi and russo  @xcite .",
    "these methods are supported by the ground breaking work of bobylev  @xcite using the fourier transformed boltzmann equation to analyze its solutions in the case of maxwell type of interactions .",
    "after the introduction of the inelastic boltzmann equation for maxwell type interactions and the use of the fourier transform for its analysis by bobylev , carrillo and one of the authors here @xcite , the spectral based approach is becoming the most suitable tool to deal with deterministic computations of kinetic models associated with boltzmann non - linear binary collisional integral , both for elastic or inelastic interactions .",
    "more recent implementations of spectral methods for the non - linear boltzmann are due to bobylev and rjasanow  @xcite who developed a method using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) for maxwell type of interactions and then for hard - sphere interactions  @xcite using generalized radon and x - ray transforms via fft .",
    "simultaneously , l. pareschi and b. perthame  @xcite developed similar scheme using fft for maxwell type of interactions .",
    "later , i. ibragimov and s. rjasanow  @xcite developed a numerical method to solve the space homogeneous boltzmann equation on a uniform grid for a variable hard potential interactions with elastic collisions .",
    "this particular work has been a great inspiration for the current work and was one of the first initiating steps in the direction of a new numerical method .",
    "+   + we mention that , most recently , filbet and russo  @xcite ,  @xcite implemented a method to solve the space inhomogeneous boltzmann equation using the previously developed spectral methods in @xcite .",
    "afore mentioned work in developing deterministic solvers for non - linear bte have been restricted to elastic , conservative interactions .",
    "finally , mouhout and pareschi  @xcite are currently studying the approximation properties of the schemes .",
    "part of the difficulties in their strategy arises from the constraint that the numerical solution has to satisfy conservation of the initial mass . to this end",
    ", the authors propose the use of a periodic representation of the distribution function to avoid aliasing .",
    "there is no conservation of momentum and energy in  @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "both methods (  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) , which are developed in 2 and 3 dimensions , do not guarantee the positivity of the solution due to the fact that the truncation of the velocity domain combined with the fourier method makes the distribution function negative at times .",
    "this last shortcoming of the spectral approach remains in our proposed technique ; however we are able to handle conservation in a very natural way by means of lagrange multipliers .",
    "we also want to credit an unpublished calculation of v. panferov and s. rjasanow  @xcite who wrote a method to calculate the particle distribution function for inelastic collisions in the case of hard spheres , but there were no numerical results to corroborate the efficiency of the method .",
    "our proposed approach is slightly different and it takes a less number of operations to compute the collision integral .",
    "+   + our current approach , based on a modified version of the work in @xcite and @xcite , works for elastic or inelastic collisions and energy dissipative non - linear boltzmann type models for variable hard potentials . we do not use periodic representations for the distribution function .",
    "the only restriction of the current method is that it requires that the distribution function at any time step be fourier transformable .",
    "the required conservation properties of the distribution function are enforced through a lagrange multiplier constrained optimization problem with the desired conservation quantities set as the constraints .",
    "such corrections to the distribution function to make it conservative are very small but crucial for the evolution of the probability distribution function according to the boltzmann equation .",
    "+   + this lagrange optimization problem gives the freedom of not conserving the energy , independent of the collision mechanism , as long momentum is conserved .",
    "such a technique plays a major role as it gives the option of computing energy dissipative solutions by just eliminating one constraint in the corresponding optimization problem .",
    "the current method can be easily implemented in any dimension .",
    "a novel aspect of the presented approach here lays on a new method that uses the fourier transform as a tool to simplify the computation of the collision operator that works , both for elastic and inelastic collisions .",
    "it is based on an integral representation of the fourier transform of the collision kernel as used in @xcite . if @xmath7 is the number of discretizations in one direction of the velocity domain in @xmath5-dimensions , the total number of operations required to solve for the collision integral are of the order of @xmath8 . and",
    "this number of operations remains the same for elastic/ inelastic , isotropic/ anisotropic vhp type of interactions .",
    "however , when the differential cross section is independent of the scattering angle , the integral representation kernel is further reduced by an exact closed integrated form that is used to save in computational number of operations to @xmath9 .",
    "this reduction is possible when computing hard spheres in d+2 dimensions or maxwell type models in 2-dimensions .",
    "nevertheless , the method can be employed without much changes for the other case .",
    "in particular the method becomes @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , the number of each angular discretizations is expected to be much smaller than @xmath7 used for energy discretizations .",
    "such reduction in number of operations was also reported in  @xcite with @xmath12 number of operations , where the authors are assuming n to be the total number of discretizations in the @xmath5-dimensional space ( i.e. our @xmath13 and @xmath11 of order of unity ) .",
    "+   + our numerical study is performed for several examples of well establish behavior associated to solutions of energy dissipative space homogeneous collisional models under heating sources that secure existence of stationary states with positive and finite energy .",
    "we shall consider heating sources corresponding to randomly heated inelastic particles in a heat bath , with and without friction ; elastic or inelastic collisional forms with anti - divergence terms due to dynamically ( self - similar ) energy scaled solutions @xcite and a particularly interesting example of inelastic collisions added to a slow down linear process that can be derived as a weakly coupled heavy / light binary mixture . on this particular case , when maxwell type interactions are considered , it is shown that @xcite , on one hand dynamically energy scaled solutions exist , they have a close , explicit formula in fourier space for a particular choice of parameters and their corresponding anti fourier transform in probability space exhibit a singularity at the origin and power law high energy tails , while remaining integrable and with finite energy .",
    "on the other hand they are stable within a large class of initial states .",
    "we used this particular example to benchmark our computations by spectral methods by comparing the dynamically scaled computed solutions to the explicit one self similar one .",
    "convergence and error results of the fourier transform lagrangian method , locally in time , are currently being developed @xcite , and it is expected that the proposed spectral approximation of the free space problem will have optimal algorithm complexity using the non - equispaced fft as obtained by greengard and lin @xcite for spectral approximation of the free space heat kernel .",
    "implementation of the space inhomogeneous case are also currently being considered . the spectral - lagrangian scheme methodology proposed here",
    "can be extended to cases of pareto tails , opinion dynamics and @xmath7 player games , where the evolution and asymptotic behavior of probabilities are studied in fourier space as well . @xcite .",
    "+   + the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "some preliminaries and description of the various approximated models associated with the elastic or inelastic boltzmann equation are presented . in section 3",
    ", the actual numerical method is discussed with a small discussion on its discretization . in section 4 , the special case of spatially homogeneous collisional model for a slow down process derived from a weakly coupled binary problem with isotropic elastic maxwell type interactions is considered wherein an explicit solution is derived and shown to have power - like tails in some particular cases corresponding to a cold thermostat problem .",
    "section 5 deals with the numerical results and examples",
    ". finally in section 6 , direction of future work is proposed along with a summary of the proposed numerical method .",

    "the variable hard potential collision kernel then takes the following general form :    * @xmath41 + with @xmath42 for maxwell type of interactions ; @xmath43 for hard spheres .",
    "in addition , if @xmath44 is independent of the scattering angle we call the interactions isotropic .",

    ", it has been established that the cauchy problem for the space homogeneous boltzmann equation has a unique solution in the class of integrable functions with finite energy ( i.e. @xmath45 ) , it is regular if initially so , and @xmath46 converges in @xmath47 to the maxwellian distribution @xmath48 associated to the @xmath49-moments of the initial state @xmath50 .",
    "in addition , if the initial state has maxwellian decay , this property will remain with a maxwellian decay globally bounded in time ( @xcite ) , as well as all derivatives if initial so ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+   + depending on their nature , collisions either conserve density , momentum and energy ( elastic ) or density and momentum ( inelastic ) or density ( elastic - linear boltzmann operator ) , depending on the number of collision invariants the operator @xmath51 has . in the case of the classical boltzmann equation for rarefied ( elastic ) mono - atomic gases ,",
