    "we take @xmath24 to be the @xmath25-field of subsets of @xmath26 generated by the finite - dimensional cylinders . finally , we take product measure on @xmath27 ; this is the measure @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a measure on @xmath18 satisfying @xmath30 for every @xmath23 .",
    "the probability space @xmath31 describes the environment .",
    "next , we fix the environment @xmath11 and consider the basic contact process under this environment .",
    "the state space of the contact process @xmath32 is @xmath33 , and the transition rates are as follows : @xmath34 readers can refer to the standard references liggett @xcite and durrett @xcite for how these rates rigorously determine a markov process @xmath35 on @xmath36 and for much on the contact process as well as other interacting particle systems .",

    "all the above models belong to static environments ; that is , the environment does not change as time goes .",
    "there are some models concerning contact processes in dynamic environments ; see , for example , broman @xcite , remenik @xcite , and steif and warfheimer @xcite .",
    "+ regarding complete convergence , bezuidenhout and grimmett @xcite showed that the complete convergence theorem holds for the basic contact process on @xmath51 .",
    "chen and yao @xcite showed that the complete convergence theorem holds for the contact process on open clusters of half space @xmath52 . in this paper , we will show that , for the general model described above , the complete convergence theorem still holds for almost every environment .",

    "then there exists @xmath59 with @xmath60 , such that for all @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 as @xmath64 tends to infinity , where  @xmath65  stands for @xmath40-weak convergence .",
    "+    the main purpose of this paper is to prove theorem [ t:1.1 ] , which will be specified in the following sections .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we give some preliminaries including some basic notation , together with an introduction to the important graphical representation . in section 3 , we prove the block conditions   which are essential to the proof of theorem [ t:1.1 ] . we prove it under three different cases . in section 4 ,",
    "we use these blocks to construct the route and use the renormalization method to make further preparations . finally , in section 5 , we prove theorem [ t:1.1 ] by checking the two equivalent conditions in theorem 1.12 of @xcite .",
    "the main idea of the whole procedure is enlightened by bezuidenhout and grimmett @xcite .",
    "but there are some big differences . in order to make good use of some symmetric properties , we need to consider the annealed law",
    "first ( sections 3 and 4 ) , then go back to the quenched law to get the desired result ( section 5 ) .",
    "the fact is , under the annealed law , the process is not markovian , but events depending on disjoint subgraphs are relatively independent . in consequence",
    ", we can only get space blocks   rather than space - time blocks   as in bezuidenhout and grimmett @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we can only use these space blocks   to obtain the result in the half space case .",
    "we believe that the result will hold for the whole space case , but we can not construct the independent restart process   as in bezuidenhout and grimmett @xcite by adopting the method of this paper .",
    "we only prove the case @xmath66 ; that is , @xmath67 .",
    "our technique still works for the case @xmath68 after trivial modifications . in this section , we introduce some basic notation for the following analysis .    when @xmath66 , for simplicity we use a complex number @xmath69 to denote the vertex @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "furthermore , we use the notation @xmath73 to denote the rectangle @xmath74\\times[\\min\\{b , d\\},\\max\\{b , d\\}],\\ ] ] that is , @xmath69 and @xmath75 are diagonal sites of this rectangle .",
    "the notation @xmath76 can be used in a more flexible way . if @xmath77  ( respectively , @xmath78 ) then @xmath73 denotes a vertical  ( respectively , horizontal ) line .",
    "we can also let @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , or @xmath82 be infinity .",
    "for example , @xmath83 denotes the infinite rectangle  @xmath84\\times[0,+\\infty)$ ] .",
    "now , we introduce a special notation @xmath85 . for @xmath86 and @xmath87 , define @xmath88 then @xmath89 is an edge set . see figure 1 .",

    "denote by @xmath97 a probability measure which satisfies @xmath98 we call @xmath97 the annealed ( average ) law and @xmath40 the quenched law .",
    "note that the contact process is markovian under the quenched law , while it is not markovian under the annealed law .",
    "+ we shall make abundant use of the graphical representation of the contact process which was first proposed in harris @xcite .",
    "we follow the notation of bezuidenhout and grimmett @xcite .",
    "fix @xmath39 , and think of the process as being imbedded in space - time . along each time - line",
    "@xmath99 are positioned deaths  at the points of a poisson process with intensity 1 , and between each ordered pair @xmath100 , @xmath101 of adjacent time - lines are positioned edges directed from the first to the second having centers forming a poisson processes of intensity @xmath102 on the set @xmath103 .",
    "these poisson processes are taken to be independent of each other . the random graph obtained from @xmath104 by deleting all points at which a death occurs and adding in all directed edges can be used as a percolation superstructure on which a realization of the contact process is built .",
    "we shall make free use of the language of percolation .",
    "for example , for @xmath105 , we say that @xmath38 is joined to @xmath106 if there exists @xmath107 and @xmath108 such that there exists a path from @xmath79 to @xmath80 traversing time - lines in the direction of increasing time ( but crossing no death ) and directed edges between such lines ; for @xmath109 , we say that @xmath38 is joined to @xmath106 within @xmath110 if such a path exists using segments of time - lines lying entirely in @xmath110 .",
    "we next extend the notion within   in this paper .",
    "for @xmath111 and @xmath112 , we say that @xmath38 is joined to @xmath106 within @xmath110 if such a path exists using segments of time - lines lying entirely in @xmath113 ; for @xmath114 , we say that @xmath38 is joined to @xmath106 within @xmath115 if such a path exists using directed edges having centers lying entirely in @xmath116 , where @xmath117 .    for @xmath118 and @xmath119 , we call @xmath120 a horizontal ( respectively , vertical ) seed with @xmath121 sites if all sites in @xmath122 ( respectively , @xmath123 ) are infected at time @xmath64 .",
    "we say that a horizontal seed @xmath124 is joined to a vertical seed @xmath125 if @xmath126 is joined to @xmath127 for all @xmath128 .",
    "the word seed   comes from grimmett @xcite .",
    "to prove theorem [ t:1.1 ] , we need to get the block conditions   for the survival of the process .",
    "the construction is enlightened by bezuidenhout and grimmett @xcite , and was used successfully in the proof of the complete convergence theorem for contact processes on open clusters of @xmath52 ; see chen and yao @xcite .",
    "we first introduce some notation we will need .    for @xmath129 ,",
    "define the random set @xmath130 hence , @xmath131 is a subset of the right side of the box @xmath132 .",
    "similarly , define @xmath133 as a subset of the left side .",
    "define the random set @xmath134 , which is a subset of the right part of the up side , as follows : @xmath135 similarly , define @xmath136 as a subset of the left part .",

    "+    the content of proposition [ p:3.2 ] is quite similar to lemma 3.2 in chen and yao @xcite , but things are much more difficult here . in the bernoulli bond percolation model",
    ", it is easy to get the property that the existence of crossing from bottom to top of a box is small if the ratio of the height to the width of the box is large enough .",
    "however , in the model presented in this paper , this property is not obvious .",
    "so we need to develop some new ideas to make the construction . in detail",
    ", we consider the following three cases , which will be proved in sections 3.13.3 , respectively . here and henceforth ,",
