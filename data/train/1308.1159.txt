    "azimuthal asymmetries in semi - inclusive deeply inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( sidis ) play an important role in the study of partonic structure of nucleon , attracting much effort in both theory  @xcite and experiment  @xcite . in such studies , spin and nuclear dependences are often important and provide an useful tool to investigate these effects . also because of this",
    ", higher twist contributions are often significant and need to be taken into account precisely .",
    "besides , such higher twist effects usually depend on new higher twist parton correlation functions hence the studies of them provide a new window to learn about the structure of nucleon .",
    "one of the most important issues in these studies is to establish the relationships between the experimentally measurable quantities and different parton distribution and/or correlation functions that describe the partonic structure of the nucleon and the properties of the hadronic interaction in a consistent theoretical framework .",
    "collinear expansion seems to be the most promising technique that leads to such a framework .",
    "it was proposed in 1980s and has been successfully applied to the inclusive processes  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , after collinear expansion , the differential cross section can be expressed as a convolution of the collinear expanded hard parts with the parton distribution and/or correlation functions in nucleon . while the hard parts are calculable",
    ", the parton distribution and/or correlation functions can be defined in terms of gauge invariant matrix elements of the nucleon state .",
    "these matrix elements contain the information about parton distributions inside the nucleon .",
    "the gauge link inside the gauge invariant matrix elements is a result of multiple gluon scattering within the collinear expansion scheme . within this scheme ,",
    "one performs taylor expansion of the hard parts around the collinear momenta .",
    "the leading twist contributions come from the zeroth order in the collinear expansion allowing all momenta taking their collinear values .",
    "higher twist contributions from the higher orders of the taylor expansion can be calculated consistently .",
    "higher twist effects in semi - inclusive deeply inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering have also been studied in literature and calculations of the differential cross section up to twist-3 level have been carried out  @xcite .",
    "however , most of these studies do not consider the application of collinear expansion . in stead , they usually start from the expressions obtained directly from the feynman diagrams , extract the leading ( twist-2 ) and the sub - leading ( twist-3 ) twist contributions by making appropriate approximations , and insert the gauge link whenever needed to guarantee the gauge invariance of the parton distribution and/or correlation functions .",
    "it is thus unknown whether , if yes , how the collinear expansion is applicable here .",
    "it is not obvious where the gauge link comes from and which form it takes .",
    "it is also not known whether the calculations extend to even higher twist .",
    "a systematic study leading to a consistent formalism is necessary but still lacking .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we made the first step towards this goal by applying the collinear expansion technique to the semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) process @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes a quark which is equivalent to a jet in experiment .",
    "we showed that the collinear expansion technique is applicable for this process and derived a formalism suitable for studying leading as well as higher twist contributions to @xmath1 in a systematic way .",
    "this formalism is similar to that we have for inclusive process and similar expressions can be obtained for the differential cross section or the hadronic tensor as a convolution of the hard parts and the un - integrated or transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) parton correlation functions .",
    "we carried out the calculations of the azimuthal asymmetries in the unpolarized cases up to twist-4  @xcite and those in the case with transversely polarized targets up to twist-3  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we also showed that the multiple gluon scattering contained in the gauge link leads to a significant nuclear dependence of the azimuthal asymmetries which can be studied experimentally  @xcite .    in this paper , we present calculations of azimuthal asymmetries in the semi - inclusive process @xmath0 with beam and target in different polarizations up to twist-3 using the formalism derived in @xcite . for completeness",
    ", we summarize the formalism in sec .",
    "ii and present the results of the hadronic tensor . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the results of the differential cross sections and the azimuthal asymmetries .",
    "we study the nuclear dependence in sec .",
    "iv and conclude in sec . v.",
    "the formalism that we use in our calculations are derived in  @xcite for the semi - inclusive process @xmath1 and are summarized in  @xcite .",
    "it is obtained by applying collinear expansion and contains the contributions from the multiple gluon scattering . for completeness and also for comparison with other approaches such as those in  @xcite , we summarize the most related results of this formalism in part a and present the results for the hadronic tensors in different polarized cases up to twist-3 in other parts of this section .",
