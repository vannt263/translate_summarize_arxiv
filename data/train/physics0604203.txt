    "since the letter of pearson  @xcite , published on nature in 1905 , random walk has become a central concept in many branches of the physical sciences .",
    "the number of applications and studies dedicated to the subject is in fact so large that to give even a very partial list of references is an overwhelming enterprise ( see  @xcite for a recent and fairly complete review ) .",
    "most of the attention , so far , has been devoted to the study of random walks and related stochastic processes on @xmath6-dimensional euclidean spaces and regular lattices , for their obvious relevance to physical problems . to extend the definition of random walk to",
    "an arbitrary graph is trivial , but its study is relatively less developed . in this paper",
    "we address the issue of the stationary probability of a random walk on a directed scale - free graph .",
    "the specific application we have in mind is the study of pagerank ( pr ) , the prestige measure that the search engine google ( and several other search engines ) employs to measure the prestige of web pages .",
    "when a user submits a query , the hits returned by google are ranked according to their pr values . as it will be clear in a moment ,",
    "such a measure is the stationary probability of a random walk on the web graph , where each node represents a web page and edges represent the hyperlinks ( naturally directed ) connecting the pages .",
    "let us consider an arbitrary undirected graph and a random walker moving on it .",
    "at any ( discrete ) time step the walker jumps from the node where it is sitting on to one of its neighbors chosen with equal probability .",
    "it is trivial to show that , at stationarity , the probability of each node to be visited is proportional to its degree , i.e. the number of neighbors of the node .",
    "if the graph is directed we have to distinguish ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) ) the links adjacent to a node in incoming ( those that point to the node ) and outgoing ( those that point away from it ) . if the random walker is allowed to follow only the outgoing links from the node where it presently is , the problem of finding the stationary probability is far more complicated .",
    "such probability will in general depend on the overall topological organization of the graph itself , and can not be expressed in terms of simple topological quantities like the degree of a node . in fact , due to the directedness of the links , the graph may have regions that the walker can enter in but not escape from . the stationary probability will be trivially concentrated in these regions . in order to prevent this from happening we",
    "will consider a modified ( directed ) random walker whose behavior is defined by the following two rules :    * with probability @xmath7 the walker follows any outgoing link of @xmath8 , chosen with equal probability ; * with probability @xmath0 it moves to a generic node of the network ( including @xmath8 ) , chosen with equal probability .",
    "this will suffice to ensure a non - zero stationary probability on every node .",
    "when considered in the context of the web graph , the process described above could be thought as a rough modelization of a web surfer that occasionally ( with probability @xmath0 ) decides to interrupt his / her browsing and to restart it from a randomly chosen page .",
    "the stationary probability of this process is exactly pr .",
    "the node in the center has two incoming and three outgoing links.,width=207 ]    to adhere to the computer science terminology , we will refer to the probability @xmath0 as to the damping factor .",
    "the damping factor adopted in real applications is generally small ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "a brave analogy with the undirected case could lead to the hypothesis that pr is roughly proportional to the in - degree of a node ( number of incoming links ) , modulo corrections due to the small damping factor .",
    "such a view could be further supported by the observation that the distribution of pr for the real web has a power law decay  @xcite characterized by an exponent @xmath10 ( see fig .",

    "the damping factor is @xmath11.,width=340 ]    mean field calculations show that there is a positive correlation between pr and in - degree  @xcite and a linear relation between in - degree and the mean pr for nodes of equal in - degree can be safely assumed if the degree correlations between adjacent nodes are weak . on a generic directed graph , the linear relationship between pr ( even if considered on average ) and",
    "the in - degree is not granted and it depends on the global organization of the graph itself . to address the issue of pr distribution for an arbitrary graph and",
    "a generic @xmath0 would therefore require a case by case study . in this paper , therefore , we concentrate on the two interesting limits , i.e. @xmath12 and @xmath13 , that show some degree of universality .",
    "in these two limits it is possible to derive analytical expressions for the distribution of pr . for small @xmath0-values , a master equation approach allows us to solve the problem for special classes of networks .",
    "for @xmath5 , it is possible to establish a one - to - one correspondence between the distribution of pr and that of in - degree , as long as the number of outgoing links from each node ( out - degree ) is the same .",
    "further , to have a better control on the topological characteristics of the graph and how they correlate with the pr distribution we work with graphs generated by random processes or processes of growth .",
    "let us consider a generic directed network with @xmath14 nodes .",
    "let @xmath15 be the pr of node @xmath8 .",
    "the vector @xmath16 satisfies the following self - consistent system of relations : @xmath17 where @xmath18 indicates a link from @xmath19 to @xmath8 and @xmath20 is the out - degree of node @xmath19 . in the following",
    "we always assume that each node has at least one outgoing link , and therefore eq .  ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "is well defined . to compute @xmath16 amounts to solve the eigenvalue problem for the transition matrix @xmath21 , whose element @xmath22 is given by the expression : @xmath23 and where @xmath24 is the adjacency matrix of the graph ( @xmath25 if there is a link from @xmath19 to @xmath8 , otherwise @xmath26 ) .",
    "the stationary probability of the process described by @xmath21 is given by its principal eigenvector .",

    ", the method converges rather quickly : in practical applications , it turns out that less than one hundred iterations suffice to calculate the pr of a network with @xmath36 vertices .",
    "pr , and therefore its distribution , depends on the damping factor @xmath0 in a non - trivial way . a first rigorous investigation of this problem was presented in @xcite with focus on how the ranking of pages is influenced by changing @xmath0 and where some close expressions for derivatives of pr with respect to @xmath0 were derived .",
    "the damping factor can be considered as an interpolation parameter between a simple random walk and a pure scattering process . when @xmath37 , the process reduces to a simple random walk , and one may end up with a trivial invariant measure concentrated on a small subset of nodes .",
    "when @xmath38 , the walker can jump to any node at each step , with probability @xmath39 .",
    "the pr of all nodes is then the same , and equals @xmath39 , as one can see by setting @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the distribution of pr is therefore a dirac @xmath40 function centered at @xmath39 . for @xmath41 the distribution is not trivial , and in general it strongly depends on the underlying graph . on the other hand , in the two limits @xmath3 and @xmath5 , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) assumes forms which lend themselves to simple analytical derivations and the pr distribution can be exactly determined for a large set of graphs .",
    "it is worth remarking that the limit of small @xmath0 is the relevant one for web applications .",
    "given a generic directed graph , the pr of a specific node depends on the overall arrangement of the graph and can not be calculated on the basis of local properties only . in the following we focus on a wide , although more restricted class of networks for which analytical solutions are possible . to this class",

    "we assume that if an oriented path from node @xmath8 to node @xmath19 exists , there is no path from @xmath19 to @xmath8 ( in other words , it is impossible to get back to a given starting point following an oriented path of the graph ) .",
    "networks that result from a growth process , where new nodes are introduced at discrete time steps together with their new oriented links , obviously belong to this class .",
    "in fact , we can label nodes according to their age ( node 1 being the oldest ) so that a directed link between @xmath8 and @xmath19 may exist only if @xmath42 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the pr @xmath15 of a generic node @xmath8 of a graph in this class can be written as follows : @xmath43\\ ] ] where the first sum runs over all nodes in the graph and the second over all paths from a generic node @xmath19 to node @xmath8 .",
    "each path in the second sum is weighted by as many factors @xmath44 as links along the path ( @xmath45 is the lenght of path @xmath46 ) and is also weighted by the inverse of the degree ( @xmath47 ) of each node @xmath48 encountered along the path .",
    "although correct for any @xmath0 , the formula above is not very transparent . in order to get some understanding on the expected distribution of pagerank in a graph , we specialize eq .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) assumes the following form @xmath141 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{q(1-q)}{mn}k_{in}(i)+\\frac{1-q}{m}\\sum_{j : j \\rightarrow i}p_r(j),\\\\ \\nonumber \\label{eq24}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath142 is the in - degree of @xmath8 . from eq .",
    "( 19 ) it follows that the rpr of a node is of order @xmath7 .",
    "all terms coming from the sum are of order @xmath143 and can be safely neglected .",
    "finally , @xmath144 the rpr of a node is then proportional to its in - degree , and the corresponding distributions coincide , under no assumptions other than the out - degree is a constant .",
    "therefore , the result has a wide generality .",
    "it is also intuitive how to extend it to the case in which the out - degree is not constant but approximately the same for all nodes .",
    "out - degree distributions concentrated about some value , like gaussians , poissonians , exponentials , etc .",
    ", should not change the result .",
    "( [ fig48 ] ) shows a test of eq .",
    "( [ eq25 ] ) .",
    "each of the four plots is a scatter plot relative to a different network ; three of them are scale - free and one has an exponential in - degree distribution ( bottom right ) , as it has been generated with a cm process for @xmath110 .",
    "the rpr of a generic node is compared with the right - hand - side of eq .",

    "we apologize with chen and colleagues for the unfortunate accident .",
    "since the birth of google , pr has attracted a lot of interest from the scientific community , but the deep reasons behind its capacity to capture the `` quality '' better than other and more used topological descriptors ( e.g. in - degree ) are not yet clear .",
    "we studied pr in a more general framework than its original field of application ( the web graph ) .",
    "we derived some exact results for pr distributions in the limit when the damping factor @xmath0 approaches the two extreme values @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath3 , for networks without directed loops and where walkers stream towards a central core of nodes ( roots ) , pr can be in principle calculated in a single sweep over the nodes , starting from the leaves and converging shell - wise towards the center .",
    "this feature allowed us to calculate exactly the distribution of pr for networks built according to some peculiar linking strategies , like that of the dms model ( which includes the ba model as a special case ) and of the cm . in these cases ,",
    "the pr distribution has a power law tail with exponent @xmath4 , for any choice of the model parameters , that , on the contrary , strongly affect the in - degree distribution .",
    "this possibly suggests that the pr process allows to diversify the roles of the different nodes much more than in - degree , and it is a better criterion to rank nodes .",
    "many networks have the features that grant , on a first approximation , the applicability of our results .",
    "networks grown about one or more centers , with new nodes pointing mostly to older nodes belong to this class .",
    "the web itself could be taken as an example of this kind of networks .",
    "the pr distribution of the web graph is usually calculated for @xmath11 , which is quite close to zero , showing an exponent indeed very close to @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "( [ figpr ] ) ) .",
    "work is in progress to determine what are the broadest conditions that yield this `` universal '' behavior .    in the limit @xmath5 ,",
    "pr is a linear function of in - degree , as long as the out - degree of the nodes is fixed .",
    "the relation holds at the level of the single node , and not merely in the statistical sense .",
    "we plan to investigate how general this result is by relaxing the assumption of constant out - degree and trying various distributions .    to summarize , the pr distribution strongly depends on the value of the damping factor @xmath0 , is in general `` uncorrelated '' from the corresponding in - degree distribution , but depends on the overall topological organizaton of the graph .",
    "this is not in contradiction with the findings of  @xcite , where a correlation between the two variables was observed , because the correlation involves the in - degree and the mean pr - value of all nodes with that in - degree . within each in - degree",
