    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is generally considered to be one of the most promising extensions of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "its attractive features include the cancellation of quadratic divergences in the higgs sector , which implies that the soft susy breaking masses of the ( yet unobserved ) superpartners of the sm particles can not be much greater than the electroweak scale . if susy is indeed responsible for the stabilization of this scale against the planck scale , supersymmetric particles should therefore be discovered either at run ii of the fermilab tevatron @xcite or at the cern lhc @xcite .",
    "in particular , the strongly coupling squarks and gluinos should be copiously produced at hadron colliders and lead to first measurements of their masses and production cross sections @xcite .",
    "precision measurements of masses , mixings , quantum numbers , and couplings must , however , be performed in the clean environment of a future linear @xmath0 collider because of the large hadronic sm background and theoretical scale and parton density uncertainties at the fermilab tevatron and cern lhc .",
    "for example , in @xmath0 annihilation the center - of - mass energy of the collision is exactly known , and threshold energy scans allow for a precise mass determination of pair - produced susy particles .",
    "it will then be possible to establish whether the masses and couplings of the electroweak gauginos and of the gluino are indeed related , as expected .",
    "a global analysis should ultimately lead to a reconstruction of the susy breaking model and its parameters . along these lines , detailed studies",
    "have recently been performed for squarks , sleptons , charginos , and neutralinos @xcite , but not for gluinos , the reason being that gluino pairs are produced at @xmath0 colliders only at the one - loop level , while all other sparticles are produced at tree level . at tree level",
    ", gluinos can be produced in pairs only in association with two quarks @xcite , or they are produced singly in association with a quark and a squark @xcite . both processes result in multi - jet final states , where phase space is limited and gluinos may be hard to isolate .    in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , the exclusive production of gluino pairs in @xmath0 annihilation",
    "is mediated by @xmath3-channel photons and @xmath2-bosons , which couple to the gluinos via triangular quark and squark loops . in earlier studies of this process only the very low center - of - mass energy region ( @xmath4 gev ) with pure photon exchange and no squark mixing @xcite or",
    "@xmath2-boson decays into light ( @xmath5 ) @xcite and very light ( @xmath6 gev ) @xcite gluinos have been considered .",
    "some authors have presented results only for @xmath7 gev and outdated top quark masses of @xmath8 gev @xcite , while others have neglected the mixing of left- and right - handed squark interaction eigenstates into light and heavy mass eigenstates @xcite , which turns out to control the production cross section to a large extent .",
    "it is the aim of this article to study the potential of high - energy linear @xmath0 colliders for the production of gluino pairs within the mssm .",
    "taking into account realistic beam polarization effects , photon and @xmath2-boson exchange , and current mass exclusion limits , we scan the mssm parameter space for various @xmath0 center - of - mass energies to determine the regions , where gluino production should be visible . furthermore we clarify the theoretical questions of the relative sign between the two contributing triangular feynman diagrams , of the possible presence of an axial vector anomaly , and the conditions for vanishing cross sections  three related issues , which have so far been under debate in the literature .",

    "we assume the maximally allowed top squark mixing with @xmath69 , @xmath70 gev , and @xmath71 gev , which can be generated by choosing appropriate values for the higgs mass parameter , @xmath72 gev , and the trilinear top squark coupling , @xmath73 gev . for small values of @xmath60",
    ", mixing in the bottom squark sector remains small , and we take @xmath74 . although the absolute magnitude of the cross section depends strongly on the gluino mass and collider energy , the relative importance of the different contributions is very similar also for higher gluino masses and collider energies .",
    "first we examine the conditions found in section [ sec:2 ] for vanishing of the photon and @xmath2-boson contributions , restricting ourselves to the third generation .",
    "since we expect the photon contribution to cancel for equal left- and right - handed squark masses , we vary the right - handed top squark mass parameter , @xmath75 , between 200 and 1500 gev , but keep @xmath76 gev fixed ( case",
    "i ) , since top and bottom squarks generally interfere destructively due to their opposite charge and weak isospin quantum numbers . as can be seen from fig.[fig:4 ] , the photon contribution cancels indeed for    @xmath77 .",
    "this is due to the fact that for photons @xmath78 and @xmath79 in eq.([eq : abcoup ] ) , while unitarity of the squark mixing matrix leads to @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , the photon contributions cancels for all flavors @xmath14 with equal squark masses . due to their charge ,",
    "top ( s)quarks contribute four times as much as bottom ( s)quarks , whose contribution is even more suppressed by the condition @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath2-boson contribution can never cancel , since @xmath83 , and therefore it depends only weakly on @xmath84 , but it can become minimal for @xmath85 . as @xmath84 gets significantly larger ( or smaller ) than @xmath86 , the photon contribution starts to dominate over the @xmath2-boson contribution .",
    "if only @xmath84 differs from @xmath86 , the third generation contributes almost 100% to the total cross section .",
    "however , if @xmath87 are varied simultaneously , all three generations contribute to the total cross section , which can therefore become significantly larger .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig:5 ] , where ( s)quark loop contributions from all three generations    have been taken into account .    when @xmath88 and large mass splittings are generated only by mixing in the top squark sector ( case ii ) , photon contributions are suppressed by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "[ fig:6 ] shows that the    @xmath2-boson contributions from top and bottom squarks interfere destructively due to opposite values of their weak isospin quantum numbers , except for @xmath89 , where the imaginary parts of the amplitudes interfere constructively .",
    "it is therefore advantageous to keep the bottom squark mass splitting small .",
    "as is also evident from fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , mixing in the bottom squark sector is of little importance .",
    "note that the central region with maximal top / bottom squark mixing is excluded by the cern lep limits on @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and the @xmath67-parameter .",
    "when @xmath86 and the diagonal elements of the squark mixing matrix ( see app.[sec : a ] ) become much larger than the quark masses and the off - diagonal elements of the matrix , the role of squark mixing is expected to be reduced .",
    "this is confirmed numerically in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] , where the dependence of    the gluino production cross section on @xmath86 is shown for the cases of maximal and vanishing top squark mixing .",
    "squarks from the first two generations contribute at most 10% at low @xmath86 and are otherwise strongly suppressed .    at future linear @xmath0 colliders it will be possible to obtain relatively high degrees of polarization , _ i.e. _ about 80% for electrons and 60% for positrons",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] we therefore    investigate the effect of choosing different electron / positron polarizations on the gluino pair production process , including contributions from all ( s)quarks . since the @xmath92 and @xmath93 helicity amplitudes vanish for both photons and @xmath2-bosons , we only show the squares of the remaining @xmath94 and @xmath95 amplitudes , which coincide for photons , but not for @xmath2-bosons .",

    "we observe an interesting second maximum , which arises from the intermediate squark pair resonance at @xmath96 gev . at threshold ,",
    "the cross section depends strongly on the gluino mass and is largest for @xmath97 gev , which we consider to be the lowest experimentally allowed value .",
    "it drops fast with @xmath98 , so that for @xmath99 gev no events at colliders with luminosities of 1000 fb@xmath100 per year can be expected , irrespective of their energy .",
    "smaller squark mixing ( cf .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) or larger values of @xmath86 ( cf .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) will reduce the cross section even further . far above threshold ,",
    "it drops off like @xmath101 and becomes independent of the gluino mass .",
    "the slow rise of the cross section can be observed even better in fig.[fig:11 ] , where the sensitivity of a @xmath102 gev collider like    desy tesla to gluino masses around 200 gev has been plotted . for the cern lhc experiments , a precision of @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) gev",
    "is expected for gluino masses of 540 ( 1004 ) gev @xcite . if the masses and mixing angle(s ) of the top ( and bottom ) squarks",

    "since the photon contributes now significantly to the cross section , it proves to be advantageous to choose the lepton polarization such that the @xmath2-boson interferes constructively with the photon , even though it is by itself slightly smaller than for the opposite choice . since all three generations",
    "add now to the cross section , it can become almost an order of magnitude larger than in the mixing scenario ( case ii ) , and even gluino masses of 1 tev may be observable at a multi - tev collider like cern clic .",

    "we confirm the result of two older papers that the divergence cancels for each squark flavor separately and not between weak isospin partners @xcite and trace the sign problem in one case to the feynman rules employed in the corresponding calculation @xcite .",
    "our results rely on two completely independent analytical calculations and one computer algebra calculation .",
    "second , we have investigated the prospects for precision measurements of gluino properties , such as its mass or its majorana fermion nature , at future linear @xmath0 colliders .",
    "we have taken into account realistic beam polarization effects , photon and @xmath2-boson exchange , and current mass exclusion limits .",
    "previously , only light gluinos at center - of - mass energies up to the @xmath2-boson mass had been investigated . within the general framework of the mssm ,",
    "we have concentrated on two scenarios of large left-/right - handed up - type squark mass splitting and large top squark mixing , which produce promisingly large cross sections for gluino masses up to 500 gev or even 1 tev .",
