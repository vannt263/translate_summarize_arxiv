    "optically induced spin polarisation of the negatively charged nitrogen - vacancy centre in diamond ( @xmath0 ) has been known for a considerable time but there has not been a satisfactory account of how it arises .",
    "this lack of explanation is of concern considering that spin polarisation is the key property that sets this centre apart from all other optically active centres in solids and has enabled diamonds to be used for many new exciting applications such as magnetic sensing @xcite , probing biological materials @xcite , and quantum information processing @xcite . in this work a transition within the spin - polarising decay path is studied using uniaxial stress .",
    "the order of the intermediate states involved is established , but more significantly it is shown that there is electron - vibration interaction associated with the lower level .",
    "this interaction is also involved in the important decay to the ground state , and it is clear that electron - vibration interaction is the factor that has been overlooked in previous treatments of the optical pumping cycle .",
    "electron - vibration interaction plays a vital role in giving rise to spin polarisation and by including it in a model of the centre we can account for the observed level of spin polarisation .",
    "the @xmath0 centre in diamond has trigonal symmetry ( @xmath1 ) and a zero - phonon line ( zpl ) at @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) corresponding to a @xmath4 transition that can be observed in absorption and emission @xcite .",
    "an additional zpl at @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) has been observed for a @xmath7 transition in emission @xcite .",
    "these lines and their inter - relationship are studied in this work using uniaxial stress .",
    "the line at @xmath2 is measured in excitation is split by applied uniaxial stress as shown in figure [ fig : strain - measurements]a .",
    "the magnitude of the splittings are in good correspondence with those obtained in absorption by hamer and davies @xcite .",
    "when the laser is tuned to one of the peaks in the spectrum , only one set of equivalent @xmath0 orientations is excited and the infra red spectrum can be measured for the same set of orientations as in figure [ fig : strain - measurements]b . as assignments for the visible features are already known , this selective excitation technique allows the infrared lines to be reliably assigned ( one modification is required from that given previously @xcite).the variation of line positions of the infra red transition can be more conveniently obtained by exciting using an intense green beam where all orientations are excited simultaneously . the variation with stress",

    "[ fig : strain - measurements ] ]    the zero - phonon line splittings are nearly all linear , and the strength of the various interactions giving rise to the shifts and splittings can be determined .",
    "the zpl corresponds to @xmath9 transitions at the trigonal sites , and the interaction for this situation has been treated previously and can be expressed as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 are electronic operators and @xmath16 are components of the stress tensor @xcite .",

    "for the same situation a new line is observed at @xmath33 as shown in figure [ fig : new - spectral - line . ] .",
    "the new line is displaced in the reverse sense and gains intensity at the expense of the former , indicating that the two levels are interacting .",
    "the line is on the low energy side of the emission spectrum , and so corresponds to a level either below the emitting level or above the lower level .",
    "the first option would lead to strong emission from the new level particularly once the transition becomes allowed , which is not observed , and so the new level must be on the high energy side of the lower state .",
    "it only gains intensity as a consequence of mixing with one of the stress split components of the lower state , which must be the orbital @xmath25 to split .",
    "this provides conclusive evidence that the @xmath34 is the lower level and the @xmath35 the emitting level , resolving the recent contention surrounding the order of the levels involved in the infrared transition @xcite .     and @xmath36 polarisations for increasing applied stress , displaced vertically for clarity .",

    "a @xmath40 component of @xmath34 is shifted up in energy and as there is interaction , the new state must likewise have @xmath41 symmetry .",
    "as there is no splitting the level will have @xmath11 symmetry in @xmath1 .",

    "the interaction can involve a distribution of vibrations but when displaced down in energy to where there is a low density of vibrational states the feature becomes sharp .",
    "the @xmath35 transition from the emitting @xmath11 level to the @xmath11 vibronic state is allowed by group theory but has no oscillator strength and requires the mixing before the transition can be observed .",
    "the energy gap to the next higher vibronic state , @xmath46 , is too large to have sufficient mixing to be observed .",
    "the emission sideband at @xmath52 can be attributed to the upper @xmath25 vibronic state shifted slightly up in energy .",
    "the size of the quadratic splitting is uncertain but indications are that there is pseudo - localised mode at @xmath53 and a jahn - teller energy of order of @xmath54 .",
    "a full treatment of the electronic structure of the @xmath0centre has been presented in a recent publication @xcite , whereas here we obtain insight by considering the centre as a trigonally distorted vacancy centre of six electrons in order to identify the correlations between the centre s different electronic states . in the trigonally distorted vacancy picture , the molecular orbitals ( mos ) of the centre",
    "are associated with the linear combinations of the dangling bonds in @xmath19 point group symmetry , such that they transform as @xmath11 and @xmath18 and can be identified as @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",

    "lowering the symmetry from @xmath19 to @xmath1 lifts the @xmath59 degeneracy to give a two - fold degenerate @xmath60 mo and a non - degenerate @xmath61 mo .",
    "the @xmath62 mo is independent of the strength of the trigonal field whereas the @xmath63 mo depends on the strength of the trigonal field as it is mixed with the higher energy @xmath64 mo of the same symmetry associated with @xmath65 ( figure [ fig : trigonal - from - tetrahedral.]a ) . in the large trigonal field limit the two @xmath11 mos ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) are related to the tetrahedral mos as @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "the energetic ordering of the states in both tetrahedral and strong trigonal field limits are taken to be consistent with hund s rules .",
    "the @xmath58 configuration gives rise to the configuration states @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath72 state splits to give the lower @xmath73 and the upper @xmath74 states in the trigonal field .",
    "the ground state @xmath73 is independent of the size of the trigonal field , whereas the @xmath74 wavefunction varies with @xmath63 .",
    "it is known that there is a large nitrogen hyperfine interaction @xcite and so @xmath63 has significant component of the nitrogen dangling bond .",
    "the @xmath75 splits with the @xmath34 decreasing in energy and the @xmath35 increasing in energy , but both interact with higher energy states of the same symmetry . in general , the states are admixtures @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "the presence of the @xmath80 transition indicates the situation is far from the large trigonal limit , where it would have zero oscillator strength . in that limit the zpl",
    "would not be displaced by @xmath11 stress components , but the nonzero @xmath20 and @xmath21 parameters indicate that it is in fact displaced .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath81@xmath82 ) state would have exactly equal contribution of @xmath83 and @xmath84 mos in the large trigonal field limit and would thus not split with @xmath25 stress components , which is clearly inconsistent with the observed splitting ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 parameters ) . from the magnitude of the stress parameters of the @xmath7 transition , particularly in comparison to the @xmath85@xmath86 transition ,",
    "an estimate can be made for @xmath87 to be of the order of 0.3 . in the large trigonal field limit @xmath87",
    "is zero , and -iin @xmath19 symmetry the @xmath34 state can be re - expressed as @xmath88@xmath89@xmath90@xmath91 corresponding to a @xmath87 value of 0.7 .",
    "hence , the observed @xmath0 situation with @xmath87 = 0.3 is intermediary and is indicated by the vertical line in figure [ fig : trigonal - from - tetrahedral.]b .",
    "spin - orbit interaction can be included in the above model of the configuration states arising from the @xmath58 configuration by considering the variation of the transverse and axial spin - orbit parameters with the trigonal field . in the @xmath58 configuration , the spin - orbit interaction is given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the transverse spin - orbit parameters , @xmath95 is the axial spin - orbit parameter , and @xmath96 are electronic spin operators for @xmath97 . in @xmath19 symmetry @xmath98 , whereas in @xmath1 the @xmath99 . note that a detailed treatment of spin - orbit and spin - spin interactions was included in the recent publication @xcite .",
    "the interactions give the fine structure and this is shown in the energy level schematic in figure [ fig : mixing - between - levels . ] .",
    "what is very important is that the triplet states are split into states either with @xmath100 or with @xmath101 spin projection .",
    "there is one minor mixing which will be mentioned later .",
    "optical transitions do not change spin projection and so the centre will remain in one of the spin projections after optical excitation .",
    "however , spin - orbit interaction will mix singlets with either of the triplet spin projections and a change of spin projection can result through intersystem crossings .",
    "an intersystem crossing will occur non - radiatively through interactions with vibrations , but the electron - vibration interaction can not by itself change spin projection . for this reason",
    "the energy levels of the @xmath0 centre are presented in figure [ fig : mixing - between - levels . ] with the admixed components arranged in three columns for @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the figure enables the allowed intersystem decay to be readily determined .",
    "components , the second column ( blue ) contains @xmath101 components , and the final column ( green ) contains the @xmath102 singlets .",
    "the primary two - hole configuration for each level is indicated in bold , and the other terms in ordinary typeface are admixed components .",
    "the coefficient @xmath87 draws attention to the mixing in the lower @xmath34 level .",
    "[ fig : mixing - between - levels . ] ]    the most common situation is for the non - radiative decay to occur through @xmath11 vibrations . for this , the two states involved in the intersystem crossing have not only to be of the same irreducible representation but have to have an admixture of a common state .",
    "there is a further restriction in that the vibrational decay will be weak for large energy gaps requiring many vibrations and so only adjacent states are considered . by inspecting figure [ fig : mixing - between - levels . ]",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath11 spin - orbit component of @xmath74 and the @xmath35 singlet level are intermixed and , therefore , allow decay via @xmath11 vibrations . for the same reason",
    "there can be decay from @xmath103 to @xmath74 but the singlet is unlikely to be populated if above the triplet .",
    "there can be radiative decay to the @xmath34 but there is no allowed decay path from the lowest singlet .",
    "the minimal decay in the upper levels and none returning the system to the ground state makes it clear that optically induced spin polarisation can not occur through spin - orbit interaction and @xmath11 vibrations alone .",
    "the factor not considered in the above is electron - vibration interaction .",
    "it is potentially a significant factor , as it can enable alternative non - radiative decay between states as will be discussed in this section , and dynamic effects within a state as discussed in the next section .",
    "a tetrahedron has symmetry adapted displacements with @xmath11 , @xmath25 and @xmath18 symmetry giving 2@xmath11 and 2@xmath25 distortions in trigonal symmetry .",
    "the linear electron - vibration interaction associated with such symmetry adapted vibrations can be written in @xmath19 as @xmath104 and in @xmath1 @xmath105    the additional decay channels introduced by electron - vibration interaction are those allowed by @xmath25-vibrations and can be determined from figure [ fig : mixing - between - levels . ] .",
    "these involve transitions where there is a change of the one electron orbits from @xmath63 to @xmath62 or between the components of @xmath62 ( @xmath83 to @xmath84 ) . in the case of the lowest transition between the @xmath34 and the @xmath106 ground state ,",
    "decay is allowed to both of the ground state components as indicated in figure [ fig : mixing - between - levels . ] .",
    "the decay to the @xmath25 ground state component ( @xmath101 ) involves a change between @xmath63 and @xmath62 orbits , whereas the decay to the @xmath11 component ( @xmath100 ) involves a change of the @xmath62 orbits .",
    "as all the spin - orbit mixings are for well separated states they will be of similar magnitude and , therefore , the relative decay rates will depend on these different orbit changes .",
    "the electron orbits for both initial and final states lie largely on the three adjacent carbons and it is likely that the @xmath25-vibration involved in the intersystem crossing will be that involving the in - plane vibration of these atoms .",
    "the reduced matrix elements of electron - vibration interaction associated with this @xmath25 vibration are related to the reduced matrix elements for tetrahedral symmetry , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the first two are equal whereas the third is zero as @xmath110 does not contain @xmath11 . in the large trigonal field limit , where @xmath63 is a linear combination of @xmath65 and @xmath111",
    "as given earlier , it is found that the reduced matrix element @xmath112 .",
    "it has been shown above that @xmath0 is not in the extreme trigonal field limit , but @xmath113 will be still smaller than @xmath114 ( estimate @xmath115 ) . from this it can be deduced that the reduced matrix elements associated with the transition to the @xmath11 component ( @xmath100 ) will be stronger than those to the @xmath25 component @xmath101 of the ground state by a factor of 3/2 .",
    "thus , the decay will favour the population of the @xmath100 level of the ground state spin triplet .    the upper triplet - singlet @xmath86 - @xmath35 inter - system crossing is also of great importance .",
    "as discussed above , relaxation from the @xmath11 spin - orbit component of @xmath86 can decay to the singlet via @xmath11-symmetry vibrations , but with electron - vibration interaction there are four additional decay channels from the @xmath25 states allowed by @xmath25-vibrations . as the states involve @xmath116 and @xmath117 configurations",
    "there is not the same justification for considering only one of the @xmath25-symmetry vibrations .",
    "the four decay channels are , however , not all equal as there will be a large variation in the magnitude of spin - orbit mixing .",
    "in particular two of these are large owing to the @xmath35 and @xmath118 singlets undoubtedly lying adjacent to the @xmath86 excited state triplet .",
    "the exact positions of the singlets are not yet known and so the relative strength of the two @xmath25-vibration induced relaxation and their strength relative to the @xmath11-vibration induced relaxation can not be estimated theoretically .",
    "however , the relative intersystem crossing rates can be obtained experimentally by comparing the emission responses upon switching on a pumping field for the cases where the system is unpolarised , polarised by previous optical excitation or inverted polarisation utilising a microwave @xmath119 pulse .",
    "such measurements have been given for ensembles @xcite and single sites @xcite .",
    "the crossing rate for @xmath101 states are estimated to be factor of six times faster than that for @xmath100 states @xcite .",
    "this requires the decay involving @xmath11 vibrations to be slightly more than a factor of two faster than those involving @xmath25 vibrations .",
    "the electron - vibration interaction is also important for the decay between the singlets , @xmath35 - @xmath34 . it does not require spin - orbit mixing and",
    "consequently can be a strong transition and is known to dominate over the radiative transition between these levels @xcite .",
    "in this and other cases we have only discussed the decay in terms of the linear process implying only one @xmath25-vibration . however ,",
    "this is the enabling process and other @xmath11 vibrations or pairs of @xmath25 vibrations will be involved in compensating for the energy gap .",
    "a degenerate vibration interacting with an orbitally degenerate electronic state can give rise to a jahn - teller or dynamic jahn - teller ( djt ) effect and the uniaxial stress measurements showed that there was just such an effect in the lowest singlet state @xmath34 . in the previous section",
    "it has been argued that there is spontaneous decay to the ground state via @xmath25 vibrations .",
    "this does not require vibrations to be present in the lattice but there is the possibility of an additional process at higher temperatures when the lowest @xmath11 vibronic level is populated . from this @xmath11 state",
    "there can be decay to the ground state with the annihilation of the @xmath25 vibration combined with additional @xmath11 vibrations or pairs of @xmath25-vibrations to make up for the energy mismatch ( anticipated to be of the order of @xmath120 ) .",
    "the additional decay path will result in a temperature dependent @xmath34 lifetime and this has been observed in both absorption @xcite and emission recovery @xcite . the two papers both reported a temperature dependence consistent with populating a level at @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "the variance from the @xmath123 observed here will be due to their value corresponding to a distribution average and this one to a peak .",
    "the presence of djt is already known to occur in the excited @xmath86 state @xcite .",
    "the electron - vibration interaction results in a change of the polarisation of the sideband from that of the zero - phonon transition @xcite and the interaction with the low frequency distribution of @xmath25-vibrations leads to a @xmath124 broadening of the zero - phonon line rather than a more normal @xmath125 dependence @xcite .",
    "there will be some quenching of the spin - orbit splitting , but the degree is unclear as the magnitude of the intrinsic spin - orbit is not known .",
    "another important consequence of the djt effect in the excited @xmath86 state is that for a fixed spin it mixes the orbital components ( no @xmath100 and @xmath101 mixing ) .",
    "the @xmath126 component of the electron - vibration interaction mixes the @xmath11 spin - orbit level with the @xmath126 level and enables population in the @xmath126 state to decay via @xmath11 vibrations , and also @xmath11 population to decay via @xmath25 vibrations .",
    "there is a similar situation for the @xmath29 component of the interaction involving the @xmath29 state .",
    "note also that population in the @xmath46 state can decay because of such mixing .",
    "the consequence is that even at zero temperature the djt will enhance the overall decay rates .    as temperature",
    "is increased there can be a real transfer of population between the @xmath86 levels through a two @xmath25 vibration process .",
    "the rate can become higher than the separation of the levels .",
    "this quenches orbital angular momentum and the result is that the excited @xmath86 state behaves as an effective orbital singlet ( figure [ fig : rate - equation - model . ] ) .",
    "there are three spin projections in the ground and three in the excited state but in each case the @xmath101 states can be treated as one . the decay rate between the singlets is fast and so they can be treated as one level .",
    "thus the dynamics of the centre can be modeled using 5 levels , and this is frequently the electronic model used in discussing room temperature observations @xcite .",
    "system may be approximated as a 5-level model .",
    "[ fig : rate - equation - model . ] ]",
    "the 5-level system is indicated in figure [ fig : rate - equation - model . ] .",
    "the effective triplet - singlet intersystem crossing rates are the sum for the various @xmath86 spin - orbit components , and are denoted by @xmath127 and @xmath128 for transfer from @xmath101 and @xmath100 respectively .",
    "the lower crossings are denoted by @xmath129 and @xmath130 anticipating spin polarisation the dashed parameters are expected to be slower than the non - dashed parameters . the optical transition strength is taken as @xmath131 .",
    "the model does not include a small mixing between the @xmath25 and @xmath132 spin - orbit components of @xmath86 state by spin - spin interaction .",
    "it is less than 1 percent and can be neglected for the case where the spin polarisation is not greater than 90 per cent .",
    "assuming that the spin lattice relaxation is indefinitely long then the degree of spin polarisation is independent of the strength of the optical field .",
    "the population ratios in the excited state and ground states during continuous optical pumping are given by @xmath133    due to the faster intersystem crossing for @xmath101 states , there is always a smaller ratio ( higher spin polarisation ) in the excited state .",
    "@xmath134 is the ratio of the lifetimes @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "different values will be obtained when the optical pumping is stopped .",
    "the polarisation will immediately reduce but by what amount depends on the @xmath136 ratio .",
    "should high pump powers be used , so that prior to turning off the pump the majority of the population is in the singlet states , then after relaxation the polarisation will be determined largely by the @xmath136 ratio .",
    "our above estimates suggest that this ratio is not very supportive of spin polarisation and it would be better to use low intensities .",
    "however , it does also indicate an opportunity to measure this ratio by examining spin polarisation as a function of the strength of the preparation pulse .",
    "the intersystem crossing ratio to the ground state was estimated as @xmath137 and the upper crossing given earlier gives @xmath138 .",
    "consequently @xmath139 and for a lifetime ratio of @xmath140 corresponds to a ground state ratio of 0.18 .",
    "this indicates a ground state spin polarisation of 82 percent in the @xmath100 state .",
    "this makes plausible comparison with experimental values of spin polarisation as they are also of the order of 80 per cent @xcite .",
    "higher spin polarisation values would mean that the ratio @xmath136 is much smaller than our estimate",
    ". this would be the case should the reduced matrix element @xmath113 for the participating @xmath25 vibration be very small but better estimates will require much more advanced theoretical modeling",
    ". however , it would be better to first establish the @xmath136 ratio experimentally .",
    "it should be recognised that due to the nature of spin - orbit interaction , intersystem crossings will always be spin selective and , hence , one can expect optical induced spin polarisation for all systems with @xmath141 ground states . whether this is observed",
    "depends on other factors .",
    "obviously the centre needs to be stable and spin lattice relaxation times reasonably long .",
    "the important aspect highlighted by the present work is the rate and sign of the intersystem crossing .",
    "there will be two crossings , and for significant spin polarisation it is beneficial to have a high branching ratio between the alternative spin projections for the two crossings to favour the same spin .",
    "the rates will be faster if the levels are close and this is more readily achieved if there are two intermediate levels ( such as the two singlets in the case of @xmath0 ) .",
    "an aspect not treated above is that optical spin readout requires the upper inter - system rate to be comparable to the optical rate , and this is probably only achievable if the levels are close to one phonon energy .",
    "clearly nv satisfies all of the above , but it should be realised that this is only achieved as a consequence of electron - vibration interaction .",
    "the upper intersystem crossing is between two close levels and although a reasonable rate maybe achievable without the vibration interaction the rate is certainly enhanced with vibrations .",
    "the vibration interaction enables additional decay paths and also improves the situation with mixing within the manifold through the djt effect .",
    "the situation is more important for the lower intersystem crossing where without the electron - vibration interaction the lower singlet level would be metastable and population would simply be transferred from triplet to singlet .",
    "this is probably what happens in several other colour centres in diamond where the alternate spin state is sufficiently long lived , for example , to allow cw epr measurements @xcite .",
    "the interaction involves low frequency vibration and the specifics of the vibration are important as it can influence the rates for the different spins .",
    "it will not be a simple procedure to identify another ` nv situation '",
    ". it may be easy to have equivalent energy structures even in similar lattices , but it is hard to anticipate how to obtain appropriate strength of electron - vibration interaction and appropriate local vibrations .    the main point of the paper has been to show that optically induced spin polarisation can only be explained when the effect of electron - vibration interaction is included alongside the electronic spin - orbit interaction in the dynamics of the centre . by using the current electronic model and including simple considerations of electron - vibration interaction it is shown that the estimated spin polarisation is in agreement with experiment .",
