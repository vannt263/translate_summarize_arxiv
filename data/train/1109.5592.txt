    "according to the holographic principle , in its most general form , it is possible to establish a correspondence / duality between physics defined in a space of dimension @xmath0 with a ( generally different ) physics on the boundary of that space , which has smaller dimension .",
    "the best known concrete realization of the holographic principle is the ads / cft correspondence @xcite . in its original formulation ,",
    "this duality establishes a correspondence between an @xmath1 supersymmetric yang - mills strongly coupled four - dimensional gauge field theory ( which turns out to be a conformal field theory , cft ) and a type iib superstring theory living in the five - dimensional anti - de sitter space ( ads@xmath2 ) . under certain conditions ( the number of gauge field flavors to be large ) the theory of superstrings turns out to be a classical gravitational theory of weakly interacting particles .",
    "therefore , a strongly - coupled quantum field theory on one side of the correspondence is described by a classical theory of ( super)gravity on the other side . while the former member of duality is difficult to deal with , the latter one is rather easily treatable .    since the initial formulations of the correspondence",
    ", the ads / cft duality has been much generalized and has provided numerous valuable simple models to study non - perturbative effects such as confinement and quantum phase transitions . however , despite a huge amount of work , the microscopic roots of the duality are not well understood .",
    "for instance , there is not a first principles derivation of the correspondence and the question about whether a bulk theory can be shown to be dual to a boundary theory without invoking the string - theoretic roots of ads / cft remains open @xcite . in this sense",
    ", it is widely accepted that ads / cft is at heart a geometric reformulation of the renormalization group ( rg ) , in which the renormalization scale becomes an extra radial dimension @xcite .",
    "recently , the outstanding progress in the setting up of real space quantum renormalization group methods based on ideas coming from quantum information , has been used to define a generalized notion of holography inspired by the ads / cft duality @xcite . the author in @xcite , has made the groundbreaking observation that the tensor networks of the _ multi scale entanglement renormalization ansatz _ ( mera ) real space renormalization group procedure @xcite , happens to be a realization of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the mera procedure is implemented through a layered network of isometric tensors , where each layer defines a rg transformation : prior to the renormalization of contiguous blocks of typically two or three lattice sites into a single site , short range entanglement between the blocks is removed .",
    "the mera coarse - graining transformation induces an rg map that can be applied arbitrarily many times keeping constant the computational cost for obtaining the consecutive effective theories yielded by the method @xcite .",
    "this renders this procedure well suited to the study of quantum critical systems , where the mera tensor network simplifies , and acquires a characteristic scale - invariant structure @xcite .",
    "the tensor networks in mera organize the quantum information contained in a state in terms of different scales and according to @xcite , the dual higher dimensional geometry emerges when one realizes that the tensors in a one dimensional scale invariant mera related with a quantum critical point , are connected so as to represent a discrete version of the three dimensional anti - de sitter space ( ads@xmath3 ) .",
    "these ideas about the holographic structure of mera have been subsequently developed / extended in @xcite .",
    "namely , the decay of correlations and the scaling of the entanglement entropy given by mera , may be explained in terms of the geodesics and the minimal surface regions appearing in the holographic proposal of @xcite . using this ,",
    "the holographic structure of mera has been exploited to analyze the correlations between two disjoint regions of a critical system described by a ( @xmath4 ) dimensional cft lying at the boundary of an asymptotically ads@xmath5 spacetime @xcite .    in this work we provide further support for the connection between the powerful toolbox of gauge / gravity dualities and the successful entanglement renormalization numerical mera method posed in @xcite by explicitly observing the correspondence between the rg flow of the two point correlations in mera and the rg flow of these functions in the context of the holographic renormalization group @xcite .",
    "the holographic rg is based on the idea that the radial coordinate of a space - time with asymptotically ads geometry can be identified with the rg flow parameter of the boundary field theory .",
    "this interpretation is rather non - trivial because defining a real space quantum renormalization group is not straightforward . in light of this , it is thus interesting to explicitly use entanglement renormalization for making more precise the role of the real space renormalization group in holography .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we review the equations accounting for the rg flow of the two point functions in the scale invariant mera states and then proceed to explicitly show in section 3 , that these equations are equivalent to those arising when considering the holographic rg of two point functions in asymptotically ads@xmath6 spacetimes . in section 4",
    "we extend our analysis and argue that for a particular choice of finitely correlated mera states , there is a reasonable holographic interpretation in terms of an ads@xmath3 black hole .",
    "a discussion of arguments showed in this paper is presented in section 5 .",
    "finally , we summarize our results .",
    "each layer in a mera tensor network implements a rg transformation which generates an individual step in a sequence of coarse grained lattices , @xmath7 . if @xmath8 denotes a local observable defined on one site of our original lattice @xmath9 , then in an scale invariant mera , the _ one site scaling superoperator _",
    "@xmath10 is defined by the operation @xmath11 and reads @xcite ,    @xmath12    where the scaling dimensions of the scaling operators @xmath13 of the theory are @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the correlator @xmath16 of two scaling operators @xmath17 and @xmath18 placed on contiguous sites on the @xmath19-th level of the mera tensor network reads , @xmath20    it is worth to point out that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are initially placed in the sites @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the original lattice @xmath9 .",
    "thus , after @xmath23 iterations of the rg transformation , @xmath17 and @xmath18 become first neighbors ( see eq.([c2 ] ) ) @xcite though , strictly speaking , @xmath24 or @xmath25 depending on the mera implentation , binary or ternary repectively .",
    "each rg iteration contributes a factor @xmath26 , so    @xmath27    where the superscript @xmath28 referring to one site operators has been dropped out and @xmath29 .",
    "defining the change of variable @xmath30 , taking into account that @xmath31 and the identity @xmath32 , the flow of @xmath33 along consecutive mera rg steps ( now labelled by the variable @xmath34 ) can be written as , @xmath35    where @xmath36 . defining @xmath37",
    ", one clearly sees that the equation ( [ merascaling ] ) is the solution of the differential equation , @xmath38    which provides the mera rg flow of the two point correlation functions @xmath39 .",
    "in order to provide some explicit formal link between mera and holography , we analyze the rg flow of the two point functions in the ads@xmath6 spacetime .",
    "as we are interested in time - independent ground states , the time dimension is irrelevant in our discussions .",
    "thus , we consider a generic metric where a dimension @xmath21 is fibered in a nontrivial way over the holographic coordinate @xmath19 , such as , @xmath40    the function @xmath41 is called the warp factor ( also known as weyl factor ) which assumes @xmath42 when considering ads space . using the change of variable @xmath30 , one obtains , @xmath43    and the warp factor turns into @xmath44 . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the holographic renormalization group equations for correlators @xmath45 ( callan - symanzik equations ) related with the geometry ( [ metric1 ] - [ metric2 ] ) can be written as , @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the warp factor @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the solution to the classical einstein equations of motion for massive free fields moving in the metric ( [ metric2 ] ) with the boundary condition @xmath51 . equation ( [ holocs ] ) in terms of the holographic dimension @xmath52 reads as , @xmath53 in the holographic duality dictionary @xcite , the scaling dimensions @xmath54 of the boundary operators @xmath55 are related with the masses @xmath56 of their dual fields @xmath57 in the bulk geometry .",
    "this relation can be derived by solving the field equation for @xmath57 ,    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the _ laplacian _",
    "operator defined by ,    @xmath60    with @xmath61 , @xmath62 the metric defined in ( [ metric1]-[metric2 ] ) , @xmath63 and imposing that the radial dependence of @xmath57 is @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "if we use this _ ansatz _ and noticing that @xmath65 , then equation ( [ holocs2 ] ) can be written as , @xmath66    that is exactly the differential equation ( [ csmera ] ) for the mera flow of correlation functions . the equivalence between ( [ csmera ] ) and ( [ holocs3 ] ) substantiates , in our opinion , the proposal that the tensor network structure of an scale invariant mera may be suitably described by the _ renormalization group interpretation _ of a higher dimensional gravity dual corresponding to the @xmath67 space - time @xcite , further aspects of which we will explore below .",
    "one could also have derived this result by means of the following : from ( [ merascaling ] ) one clearly sees that , as one moves deeper along the holographic direction @xmath68 , @xmath69 scales as , @xmath70 where @xmath71 corresponds to a displacement in the direction of the rg coordinate @xmath19 ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "indeed , correlation functions @xmath73 on different depths of the holographic coordinate @xmath52 are related by the simple rescaling @xmath74 .",
    "this is exactly the behaviour expected for the long distance behaviour of the correlation functions in a wilsonian effective treatment .",
    "a wilsonian renormalization procedure amounts to integrate out short distance degrees of freedom and absorb the result into varying coupling constants which are therefore said to flow .",
    "this procedure shows that long distance physics is not sensitive to short distance details @xcite .",
    "both mera and a wilsonian rg procedure carry out a covariant reescaling of the physical coordinates ( @xmath21 in our considerations ) .",
    "thus , if one does not merely interpret @xmath52 as a variable which measures the depth in the mera tensor network , but otherwise , adopts it as a new coordinate in a geometrical dual description of the mera rg flow , then the wilsonian interpretation of ( [ corrscale ] ) leads to postulate a metric for this dual geometric model with a factor accounting for the covariant rescaling of the coordinate @xmath21 .",
    "this is precisely the effect of the warp factor @xmath44 in ( [ metric2 ] ) .",
    "put otherwise , the metric that describes the characteristic scaling of the two - point correlation functions within the mera framework , corresponds to the metric of the @xmath75 space @xcite when ( [ corrscale ] ) is looked at from a wilsonian viewpoint .",
    "namely , it is easy to check that ( [ metric2 ] ) is invariant under the wilsonian covariant rescaling @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "in the ads / cft @xcite correspondence , a given geometry corresponds to some state in the dual field theory .",
    "for instance , massive two dimensional quantum field theories are represented in the dual gravity side by an infrared ( ir ) deformation of the ads@xmath6 space that caps off or truncates the ir region @xmath78 .",
    "thus , the important quantity in the massive theory is the correlation length @xmath79 , which is identified with @xmath80 in ads / cft @xcite .    in @xcite , the emergence of the gravity dual picture to a mera tensor network state",
    "is intimately related to the structure of the quantum entanglement between the microscopic degrees of freedom of the quantum system under consideration @xcite .",
    "indeed , this amount of entanglement depends on the scale at which one is probing the system . for instance",
    ", a gapped state presents no correlations beyond a distance of order of the inverse mass .",
    "similarly , a deconfined finite temperature system at temperature @xmath81 will also present no correlations for distances larger than a characteristic length scale @xmath82 .",
    "let us then consider the ground state @xmath83 of a system , in which the two point correlation functions decay exponentially due to the existence of a characteristic length scale @xmath79 . in this case , the correlation length @xmath79 shrinks to one ( in units of separation between lattice sites ) after @xmath84 coarse - graining steps .",
    "in other words , one needs @xmath84 renormalization steps to obtain a coarse grained version @xmath85 of the ground state under consideration in which all two point correlators decay exponentially .",
    "following @xcite , it is thus reasonable to assume that this later state may be well approximated by the product state    @xmath86    ( _ i.e _ a state with no correlations between different lattice sites ) and that the state @xmath87 may be represented by a _ finite range _ mera , composed by a finite number @xmath88 of mera layers and which geometrical description results truncated in the holographic rg direction by the presence of a _ truncating boundary _ in the value of the scale parameter @xmath89 given by @xmath90 .    in order to extend the explicit link between mera and gauge / gravity dualities of the previous section , in the following",
    ", we will consider a particular choice of finite range mera , in which its first @xmath91 layers of tensors correspond to those in the scale invariant mera that describes the neighbouring critical point .",
    "here we try to show , by means of an holographic argument , that this finite range mera may suitably represent the ground state of an infinite scale invariant quantum critical system heated up to the finite temperature @xmath92 .    with this choice of finite range mera ,",
    "let us now consider the correlator between two scaling operators @xmath55 and @xmath93 located at sites @xmath94 and @xmath95 in @xmath96 and separated by a distance @xmath97 such that @xmath98 . in mera , the _ causal cone _ of a set of sites located at @xmath9 is defined by all the tensors in @xmath99 that affect the expectation values of operators with support on those sites @xcite .",
    "when the causal cones of two sites merge at some level @xmath19 of the scale invariant tensor network , the operators defined on the boundary are correlated with the algebraic decaying functional dependence of ( [ merascaling ] ) .",
    "when @xmath98 , the causal cones of the two scaling boundary operators @xmath100 overlap after @xmath101 mera steps . as a result , as @xmath102 , the stereotypical @xmath103-shaped causal cone @xmath104}$ ] ( fig1 , left ) is not distorted by the presence of the boundary at @xmath105 .",
    "namely , the mera rg flow only runs through length scales @xmath106 while not being affected by the truncating boundary at @xmath107 and giving for the two point function of the two scaling operators ,    @xmath108    with @xmath109 . as posed in @xcite , the boundary of the causal cone in an optimized scale",
    "invariant mera is a curve of minimal length ( geodesic ) connecting the boundary points @xmath94 and @xmath95 in the dual ads description of the tensor network . in the case of @xmath106 ,",
    "the geodesic connecting the two sites within the truncated holographic geometry only probes the @xmath67 region of the finite range mera geometry that we are considering in this section .    at variance , when @xmath110 , the geodesic curve connecting @xmath94 and @xmath95 within the tensor network ( the length of the curve which is the boundary of @xmath104}$ ] ) results distorted ( namely , it grows proportional to @xmath111 , fig1 , right ) as a consequence of the truncation of the @xmath103-shaped causal cone @xmath104}$ ] at @xmath105 @xcite . as posed by authors in @xcite , while it is tempting , it is not straightforward to infer a justified scaling for @xmath69 when @xmath112 by directly looking at the geometry of the truncated causal cone . nevertheless , some intuition may point out to expect an exponential decay of the correlators .",
    "namely , a finite range mera in @xmath113 dimensions composed of @xmath114 layers of tensors and bond dimension @xmath115 , can be re - expressed as a matrix product state ( mps ) with bond dimension @xmath116 given by    @xmath117    our intuition is confirmed as one realizes that in an infinite and translational invariant mps with finite bond dimension @xmath116 , the correlation between two sites decays exponentially with the distance @xmath111 between them @xcite and thus , a sensible _ ansatz _ for the scaling of @xmath69 when @xmath118 is given by ,    @xmath119    the two limits @xmath106 ( eq ( [ asympads ] ) ) and @xmath120 ( eq .

    "the arguments presented in the previous sections are based on an explicit analysis of the behaviour of two point functions in two types of mera tensor states .",
    "it is interesting to discuss some features of the conclusions raised there from different points of view .",
    "first , let us to briefly analyze if our interpretation of the finite range mera composed by @xmath114 layers of tensors which are associated to an scale invariant mera , in terms of the vaccum state of a cft at the finite temperature @xmath92 , is consistent with the known results for the scaling of the entanglement entropy in these states @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , the higher dimensional geometry defined by mera may be usefully visualized by locating cells around all the sites of the tensor network : these cells are unit cells filling up the emerging geometry and the size of each cell is defined to be proportional to the entanglement entropy of the site in the cell .",
    "the scale invariance of the first @xmath88 layers in our finite range mera forces each layer to be identical and all the sites at each layer to be equivalent and have the same size .    in mera , as one proceeds to compute the entanglement entropy of a block of @xmath161 sites in @xmath9 , it is necessary to trace out any site in the bulk geometry defined by the tensor network which does not lie in the causal cone of the block .",
    "the boundary of this causal cone is a curve in the mera induced ads higher dimensional geometry which length is , by definition , the sum of the entropies of all the traced out sites .",
    "namely , in an optimized finite range mera similar to the one considered here , the length of this geodesic curve is given by ( [ dist ] ) where now , @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "if one considers a block of size such that @xmath163 , in this case , the geodesic in the truncated holographic geometry of our finite range mera state , only runs through length scales @xmath164 smaller than @xmath128 , _",
    "i.e _ the geodesic only runs through the scale - invariant ads@xmath3-like region of the finite range mera and its length remains logarithmic in @xmath161 as in a critical system .",
    "this yields the well known scaling for the entanglement entropy of the block ,    @xmath165    on the other hand , when @xmath166 , the length of the geodesic curve grows proportional to @xmath161 so ,    @xmath167    in other words , as the spatial size of the filling cells of the sites in the boundary of the causal cone of the block are all non zero , the sum of the entropies associated to these sites become proportional to the size of the block . as a consequence ,",
    "the entanglement entropy of a block of size @xmath168 in our finite range mera , has the usual boundary contribution plus an extensive piece , consistent with the presence of a black hole horizon @xcite .",
    "note that this interpretation does not hold for all finite range mera states .",
    "namely , the tensors in different layers of finite range mera states are generally different , which is a manifestation of the fact that the amount of entanglement in the ground state of these states varies depending on the length scale investigated . for a general finite range mera state , the size of the filling cells at the initial layers of the network is non - zero because there is short range entanglement in the system",
    ". however , entanglement and therefore , the size of the filling cells , decreases as one moves deeper into the mera geometry ( _ i.e _ , as one probes bigger length scales in the system ) until it is absent at a layer of the mera network called _ factorization scale _ , which is equivalent to the characteristic length scale of the system @xcite .",
    "the size of the filling cells at this layer shrinks to zero and thus , the entanglement entropy of a block receives contributions only from a finite range of scales while there is no trace of an extensive term in the entropy of the block .",
    "finally , it is worth to regard that the two different regimes for the rg flow of the two point correlation functions in the finite range mera that has been considered here ( eq . ( [ holocs3 ] ) for @xmath106 and eq.([csfincorr ] ) for @xmath120 ) , reflect the non - trivial global structure of the mera renormalization group flow in these states .",
    "namely , an holographic interpretation has been given in terms of an ads black hole .",
    "in the previous section we have mentioned that the presence of a black hole in the ads@xmath3 space corresponds to an orbifolding of this space . to be more explicit ,",
    "let us note that 3-d ads gravity can be described by a chern - simons theory with a boundary ( wess - zumino - witten wzw model ) and is exactly solvable @xcite .",
    "this fact , allows to translate the ads@xmath3 orbifolding into the gauging of the @xmath169 isometries of the ads@xmath3 : in the region where @xmath106 ( asymptotic ads region ) the dual cft is given by an @xmath170 wzw model and in the near horizon region ( @xmath152 ) one gets an @xmath171 wzw model .",
    "due to the difference in the central charges of both models , no marginal deformation between them exists .",
    "so , a nontrivial renormalization group flow is expected while the complete bulk physics is fixed by these boundary cfts .",
    "however , it is worth to stress that the btz black hole geometry is locally ads@xmath3 at any point so , these two different central charges explicitly point out to the non - trivial global structure of the underlying renormalization group flow @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have provided an explicit formal equivalence between the rg flow of the two point correlation functions in two types of mera states , and the holographic rg flow of these correlation functions in ads spacetimes to further elucidate and make more precise the connection between holography and entanglement renormalization proposed in @xcite .",
    "this equivalence substantiates , in our opinion , the proposal that the tensor network structure of the mera states under consideration may suitably be described by the renormalization group interpretation of a higher dimensional gravity dual : the ads@xmath3 if one considers the scale invariant mera and the btz black hole geometry ( an ads@xmath3 black hole ) in the case that one deals with a finite range mera composed of a finite number of layers made by the same tensors that would describe an scale invariant mera related to a neighbouring critical point . in the latter case ,",
    "the non trivial rg flow of the correlation functions for the finite range mera under consideration , is naturally expalined when one considers the btz black hole as an orbifold of the ads@xmath3 space .",
    "our observations here may give some hints on how to develop a formal procedure to explicitly build the holographic dual of some generalizations of mera accounting for exotic critical states that show violations of the boundary area law for the scaling of the entanglement entropy @xcite , which motivates a deep an subtle analysis of the rg flow related with these states .",
    "finally , as posed in @xcite , the emergence of the gravity dual picture to a mera tensor network state is intimately related to the mera coarsesing procedure ( rg flow ) and by the structure of the entanglement between the microscopic degrees of freedom of the quantum system at the boundary . in light of this , it is interesting to investigate which classes of coarsening transformations lead to rg flows on which there is a natural geometry .",

    "<S> in this work we provide additional support for the proposed connection between the gauge / gravity dualities in string theory and the successful multi - scale - entanglement - renormalization - anstaz ( mera ) method developed for the efficient simulation of quantum many body systems at criticality . </S>",
    "<S> this support comes by showing an explicit formal equivalence between the real space renormalization group ( rg ) flow of the two point correlation functions in different types of mera states and the holographic rg flow of these correlation functions in asymptotically anti de sitter ( ads ) spacetimes . </S>",
    "<S> these observations may be useful in order to formalize and make more precise the connection between the properties of different mera states and their potential holographic descriptions . </S>"
