    "the coronal heating problem , the puzzle of what maintains the solar corona 200 times hotter than the photosphere , is one of the main outstanding questions in solar physics .",
    "a significant amount of work has been done in the context of heating of open magnetic structures in the solar corona ( e.g. phase mixing , one of the possible mechanisms of the heating ) .",
    "historically all phase mixing studies have been performed in the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) approximation , however , since the transverse scales in the alfvn wave collapse progressively to zero , the mhd approximation is inevitably violated .",
    "thus , @xcite studied the phase mixing effect in the kinetic regime , using particle - in - cell simulations , i.e. beyond a mhd approximation , where a new mechanism for the acceleration of electrons due to the generation of a parallel electric field in the solar coronal context was discovered .",
    "this mechanism has important implications for various space and laboratory plasmas , e.g. the coronal heating problem and acceleration of the solar wind .",
    "it turns out that in the magnetospheric context , a similar parallel electric field generation mechanism in the transversely inhomogeneous plasmas has been previously reported @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite and references therein .",
    "after the comment paper by @xcite we came to the realisation that the electron acceleration seen in both series of works @xcite is a non - resonant wave - particle interaction effect . in works by @xcite",
    "the electron thermal speed was @xmath4 while the alfvn speed in the strongest density gradient regions was @xmath5 ; this unfortunate coincidence led us to the conclusion that the electron acceleration by parallel electric fields was affected by the landau resonance with the phase - mixed alfvn wave . in works by @xcite the electron thermal speed was @xmath4 while the alfvn speed was @xmath6 because they considered a more strongly magnetised plasma applicable to earth magnetospheric conditions .",
    "however , the interaction of the alfvn wave with a transverse density plasma inhomogeneity when the landau resonance condition @xmath7 is met can be quite important for the electron acceleration @xcite .",
    "@xcite assert that the electron acceleration observed in density cavities in aurorae can be explained by the landau resonance of the cold ionospheric electrons with the alfvn wave .",
    "@xcite also established that at the resonance alfvn wave fully converts into the kinetic alfvn wave with the perpendicular wavelength comparable to the ion gyro - radius .",
    "we can then conjecture that _ because of kinetic alfvn wave front stretching _ ( due to phase mixing , i.e. due to the differences in local alfvn speed ) , this perpendicular component _ gradually realigns _ with the ambient magnetic field and hence creates the time varying parallel electric field component .",
    "this points to the importance of the landau resonance for electron acceleration when the resonance condition is met .",
    "but as witnessed from works of @xcite , even when the resonance condition is not met electron acceleration is still possible .",
    "there were three main stages that lead to the formulation of the present model .",
    "\\(i ) the realisation of the parallel electric field generation ( and particle acceleration ) being a _ non - resonant _ wave - particle interaction effect lead us to the question : could such parallel electric fields be generated in a mhd approximation ?",
    "\\(ii ) next we realised that if one considers",
    "_ non - linear _ generation of the fast magnetosonic waves in the transversely inhomogeneous plasma , then @xmath8 contains a non - zero component parallel to the ambient magnetic field @xmath9 .",
    "\\(iii ) from previous studies @xcite we knew that the fast magnetosonic waves ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) did not grow to a substantial fraction of the alfvn wave amplitude .",
    "however after reproducing the old parameter regime ( k=1 , i.e a frequency of 0.7 hz ) , the case of k=10 , i.e a frequency of 7 hz was considered , which showed that fast magnetosonic waves and in turn a parallel electric field were more efficiently generated .",
    "unlike previous studies @xcite , here we use an ideal mhd description of the problem .",
    "we solve numerically ideal , 2.5d , mhd equations in cartesian coordinates , with a plasma beta of 0.0001 starting from the following equilibrium configuration : a uniform magnetic field @xmath12 in the @xmath13direction penetrates plasma with the density inhomogeneity across the @xmath14direction , which varies according to @xmath15 . \\ ] ] this means that the plasma density increases from some reference background value of @xmath16 , which in our case was fixed at @xmath17 g @xmath18 ( with a molecular weight of @xmath19 corresponding to the solar coronal conditions @xmath20h:@xmath21he=10:1 and @xmath22 being the proton mass ) , to @xmath23 .",
    "such a density profile across the magnetic field has steep gradients with a half - width of 3 mm around @xmath24 mm and is essentially flat elsewhere .",
    "such a structure mimics e.g. the footpoint of a large curvature radius solar coronal loop or a polar region plume with the ratio of the density inhomogeneity scale and the loop / plume radius of 0.3 , which is the median value of the observed range 0.15 - 0.5 .",
    "the initial conditions for the numerical simulation are @xmath25 and @xmath26 at @xmath27 , which means that a purely alfvnic , linearly polarised , plane wave is launched travelling in the direction of positive @xmath28s .",
    "the rest of the physical quantities , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( which would be components of fast magnetosonic waves if the medium were totally homogeneous ) and @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( the analogs of slow magnetosonic waves ) are initially set to zero .",
    "the plasma temperature is varied as the inverse of eq.(1 ) so that the total pressure always remains constant .",
    "boundary conditions used in our simulations are periodic along the @xmath28- and the zero gradient along the @xmath31-coordinates .",
    "we fixed the amplitude of alfvn wave @xmath32 at 0.05 throughout .",
    "this choice makes the alfvn wave weakly non - linear .    as a self - consistency test , we considered situation when the wavenumber of the initial alfvn wave is @xmath33 . in dimensional units",
    "this corresponds to an alfvn wave with frequency ( @xmath34 hz ) , i.e. longitudinal wave - numbers @xmath35 mm .",
    "we corroborated the previous results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we now present results for the case of large wave - numbers , @xmath36 , which in dimensional units correspond to an alfvn wave with @xmath0 hz , and @xmath1 mm .",
    "this is a regime not investigated before . in fig .",
    "( 1 ) we show shaded surface plots of both the fast magnetosonic waves ( @xmath10 ) and parallel electric field @xmath37 . we gather from this graph that similarly to the results of @xcite and @xcite , the generated parallel electric field is quite spiky , but more importantly large wave - numbers i.e. short wavelength now are able to significantly increase the amplitudes of both the fast magnetosonic waves ( @xmath10 ) and parallel electric field @xmath37 .",
    "this amplitude growth is beyond a simple @xmath38 scaling .",
    "the amplitude growth is presented quantitatively in fig .",
    "( 2 ) ( by doubling spatial resolution we perform satisfactory convergence test ) .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath10 now attains values of 0.01 unlike for moderate @xmath39s .",
    "thus , large wavenumbers ( i.e. stronger spatial gradients ) seem to yield larger values for the level of saturation of the @xmath10 amplitude . in the considered case",
    ", @xmath37 now attains values of 0.001 .",
    "the coronal energy losses that need to be compensated by some additional energy input , to keep the solar corona at the observed temperatures , are ( in units of erg @xmath40 s@xmath2 ) : @xmath41 for the quiet sun , @xmath42 for a coronal hole and @xmath43 for an active region .",
    "one can estimate the heating flux per unit area ( i.e. in erg @xmath40 s@xmath2 ) : @xmath44 where @xmath45 erg @xmath18 s@xmath2 .",
    "this yields an estimate of @xmath46 erg @xmath40 s@xmath2 in an active region with a typical loop base electron number density of @xmath47 @xmath18 and @xmath48 mk .",
    "the energy density associated with the parallel electric field @xmath37 is @xmath49 \\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the dielectric permitivity of plasma .",
    "the latter can be deduced from @xmath51 for the coronal conditions ( @xmath52 g @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath53 gauss ) @xmath54 . in fig .",
    "( 2 ) we saw that electric field amplitude attains a value of @xmath55 . in order to convert this to dimensional units we use",
    "@xmath56 km s@xmath2 and @xmath53 g and @xmath9 to obtain @xmath57 statvolt cm@xmath2 ( in gaussian units ) .",
    "therefore the energy density associated with the parallel electric field @xmath37 ( from eq.(3 ) ) is @xmath59 @xmath60.$ ]    in order to get the heating flux per unit area for a _ single harmonic _ with frequency 7 hz , we multiply the latter expression by the alfvn speed of 4328 km s@xmath2 to obtain @xmath61,\\ ] ] which is @xmath62 % of the coronal heating requirement estimate for the same parameters made above using eq.(2 ) .",
    "note that the latter estimate is for a _ single harmonic _ with frequency 7 hz",
    ".    a crucial next step that is needed to understand how the generated electric fields parallel to the uniform unperturbed magnetic field dissipate _ must invoke kinetic effects_. in our two stage model , in the first stage bulk mhd motions ( waves ) generate the parallel electric fields , which can not accelerate particles if we describe plasmas in the ideal mhd limit . @xcite and @xcite showed that when the identical system is modelled in the kinetic regime particles _ are _ accelerated with such parallel fields and alfvn wave energy",
    "is converted into heat on a time scale of a few alfvn periods .",
    "alfvn waves as observed in situ in the solar wind always appear to be propagating away from the sun and it is therefore natural to assume a solar origin for these fluctuations . however , the precise origin in the solar atmosphere of the hypothetical source spectrum for alfvn waves ( turbulence ) is unknown , given the impossibility of remote magnetic field observations above the chromosphere - corona transition region .",
    "studies of ion cyclotron resonance heating of the solar corona and high speed winds exist which provide important spectroscopic constraints on the alfvn wave spectrum . although the spectrum can and is observed at distances of 0.3 au , it can be projected back to the base of corona using empirical constraints .",
    "therefore , we conjecture that wide spectrum ( 10@xmath3 hz ) alfvn waves , based on the observationally constrained spectrum , could provide the necessary coronal heating requirement .",
    "the exact amount of energy that could be deposited by such waves through our mechanism of parallel electric field generation can only be calculated once a more complete parametric study is done .",
    "thus , the `` theoretical spectrum '' of the energy stored in parallel electric fields versus frequency needs to be obtained . at present",
    "we only have two points , 0.7 hz and 7 hz , in our `` theoretical spectrum '' .",
    "preliminary results will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "there are two main candidates for the solution of the coronal heating problem : so - called dc and ac models .",
    "dc or magnetic reconnection based models need to invoke anomalous resistivity ( somewhat ad hoc concept , but there is a lot of indirect evidence for it ) . at present the details of reconnection in 3d",
    "are not understood in full .",
    "ac models are often not quantitative , or not enough heating can be provided , unless some enhanced dissipation mechanisms ( e.g. phase - mixing , resonant absorption ) are invoked .",
    "this makes a perfect playground for studying interplay between mhd and kinetic theories of the solar corona .",
    "the reason is two - fold : 1 ) the issue of anomalous resistivity on which dc models rely can only be settled by studying kinetic effects ( micro - physics ) ; 2 ) ac models which use mhd eventually break down , as often system naturally evolves towards progressively small scales ( e.g. in phase - mixing ) ; therefore , kinetic effects become important .",
    "@xcite , amongst other findings , established that the alfvn wave amplitude decay law in the inhomogeneous regions , in the kinetic regime is @xmath63 $ ] ( where @xmath31 is the coordinate along uniform magnetic field ",
    "mind the change of the geometry ! ) ; which is the same as in the mhd approximation discovered by heyvaerts and priest ( 1983 ) ( hp83 thereafter ) : @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "question that begs to be asked : what if we calculate resistivity from the latter mhd formula using our kinetic ( pic ) empirical dissipation length of @xmath65 ?",
    "( f. malara , private communication ) . by equalising expressions under the both exponents and noting that @xmath31 from hp83 is equal to @xmath66 from our kinetic formula , we obtain @xmath67 $ ] . in order to estimate @xmath68 we put @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the alfvn speed at the strongest gradient point and @xmath71 is the strength of the gradient .",
    "the latter can be approximated as @xmath72 , with @xmath73 being the scale of the transverse density gradient .",
    "putting @xmath74 and @xmath75 we obtain @xmath76 . from @xcite @xmath77 and @xmath78 , hence @xmath79 . also , @xmath80 . the thermal speed of electrons ( at infinity ) @xmath81 , which for 1mk coronal temperature is @xmath82 cm s@xmath2 . the electron cyclotron frequency @xmath83 $ ] , which for 10 g magnetic field is @xmath84 s@xmath2 .",
    "thus , @xmath85 cm and we finally obtain @xmath86 @xmath87 s@xmath2 , or in si units @xmath88 m@xmath89 s@xmath2 .",
    "this is about 100 times greater than the classical braginskii value for the resistivity .",
    "therefore , the obtained value is a clear indication of the _ anomalous resistivity_. interestingly others quote similar values for the @xmath90 @xcite .",
