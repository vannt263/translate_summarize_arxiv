    "the kerr - newman rotating black hole solution has gyromagnetic ratio @xmath0 as that of the dirac electron .",
    "the measurable parameters of the electron : spin , mass , charge and magnetic moment determine the gravitational and electromagnetic field of electron as field of the over - rotating kerr - newman ( kn ) solution .",
    "the corresponding space - time has topological defect  the naked kerr singular ring , which forms a branch line of the kerr space into _ two sheets : _ the sheet of advanced and sheet of the retarded fields .",
    "the kerr - schild form of metric @xciteg_=_+ 2h k_k_,[ksh ] in which @xmath1 is metric of auxiliary minkowski space @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a null vector field , @xmath4 forming the principal null congruence ( pnc ) @xmath5 the retarded and advanced sheets are related by a smooth transfer of the kerr pnc via disk @xmath6 spanned by the kerr singular ring @xmath7 ( see fig.1 ) , where @xmath8 is the kerr ellipsoidal radial coordinate . the surface @xmath9 represents a disklike `` door '' from negative sheet @xmath10 to positive one @xmath11 .",

    "singular metric conflicts with basic principles of quantum theory which is settled on the flat space - time and negligible gravitation .",
    "resolution of this conflict requires `` regularization '' of space - time , which has to be done _ before quantization ,",
    "i.e. on the classical level_. singular region has to be excised and replaced by a regular core with a flat internal metric @xmath15 matching with external kn solution .",
    "long - term search for the models of regular source ( h. keres ( 1966 ) , w. israel ( i970 ) , v. hamity ( 1976 ) , c. lpez ( 1984 ) at al .",
    "see refs in @xcite ) resulted in appearance of the gravitating soliton model @xcite which represents a domain - wall bubble , or a bag confining the higgs field in a superconducting false - vacuum state .",
    "such a matter regulates the kn electromagnetic ( em ) field pushing it from interior of the soliton to domain wall boundary and results in consistency of the internal metric with flat space required by quantum theory .",
    "the higgs mechanism of broken symmetry approaches this field model with the famous mit and slac bag models @xcite .",
    "however , the typical quartic potential v(||)=g(|- ^2)^2 , [ phi4 ] used for the self - interacting higgs field @xmath16 , in the most of the soliton and bag - like models can not provide consistency with external kn solution .",
    "eg , in the mit bag model , the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field @xmath17 vanishes inside the bag , @xmath18 and takes non - vanishing value @xmath19 _ outside the bag , _",
    "@xmath20 therefore , the bag forms a well or cavity in the space - time filled by the higgs condensate in a superconducting phase , and this condensate turns the external electromagnetic fields in the short - range ones , spoiling the external kn solutions .",
    "similar problem appears also in the slac bag model .",
    "to ensure the correct external gravitational and electromagnetic ( em ) fields , the symmetry breaking mechanism should be turned inside out : the higgs condensate must be localized inside the bag , @xmath21 leaving the unbroken external vacuum state .",
    "formation of the corresponding potential turns out to be a very non - trivial problem , and to realize it , we used in @xcite a supersymmetric scheme of phase transition with three chiral fields @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "one of which , say @xmath23 has the required radial dependence , and we chose it as the higgs field @xmath24 setting the new notations in accord with @xmath25 the required potential @xmath26 is obtained from the superpotential @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are real constants .",
    "the condition @xmath30 determines two vacuum states separated by a spike of the potential @xmath31 by @xmath32 :    \\(i ) external vacuum , @xmath33 , @xmath34 with vanishing higgs field @xmath35 , and    \\(ii ) internal state of false vacuum , @xmath36 , @xmath34 with broken symmetry , @xmath37    \\(iii ) intermediate region of the domain wall phase transition @xmath32    _ the boundary of phase transition is unambiguously determined _ by matching the external kn metric @xmath38 where h= with flat internal metric @xmath39 it fixes the boundary at @xmath40 which yields r = r_e = . [ re ] since @xmath8 is the kerr oblate coordinate , the bag forms an oblate disk of the radius @xmath41 with thickness @xmath42 so that @xmath43    the choose of lpes s boundary for regularization of the kn source allows us to neglect gravity inside the source and in the zone of phase transition and consider there the space - time as flat , while outside the source the gravity and em field are unbroken .",
    "inside the source we have only the part of lagrangian which corresponds to self - interaction of the complex higgs field and its interaction with vector - potential of the kn electromagnetic field @xmath44 in the flat space - time . the field model in zone ( iii )",
    "is reduced to the nielsen - olesen model for a vortex string in superconducting media @xcite , _",

    "[ main ] analysis of the equation ( [ main ] ) in @xcite showed two remarkable properties of the kn rotating soliton :    * ( a ) * the vortex of the kn vector potential @xmath49 forms a quantum wilson loop placed along the border of the disk - like source , which leads to _ quantization of the angular momentum _ of the soliton ,    * ( b ) * the higgs condensate should _ oscillate _ inside the source with the frequency @xmath50 .",
    "the kn vector potential has the form @xcite a_dx^= - re [ ( e r+ia ) ( dr - dt - a ^2 d ) [ am ] .",
    "maximum of the potential is reached in the equatorial plane , @xmath51 , at the lpez s boundary of the disk - like source ( [ re ] ) , @xmath52 which plays the role of a cut - off parameter , a^max_dx^= - e r_e ( dr - dt - a d ) [ amax ] . according to ( [ main ] ) vector field",
    "is regularized , since it can not penetrate deeply inside the higgs condensate for the phase incursion of the higgs field .",
    "one sees , that the @xmath53 component of the kn vector potential @xmath54 forms a circular flow ( wilson loop ) near the source boundary . according to ( [ main ] ) , this flow does not penetrate inside the source beyond @xmath55 since it is compensated by gradient of the higgs phase @xmath56 integration of this relation over the closed @xmath53loop under condition @xmath57 leads to the result * ( a)*. similarly , the result * ( b ) * follows from ( [ main ] ) under condition @xmath57 for the time component of the vector potential @xmath58",
    "the bag models give significant progress in the fermionic sector of the extended particle - like solutions . in the slac bag theory , @xcite ,",
    "the dirac equations interacting with the classical vev of the higgs field @xmath59-field take the form ( i^_- g ) = 0 [ dir - sigma ] , where @xmath60 is a dimensionless coupling parameter .",
    "one sees that the dirac field @xmath61 acquires from the higgs field effective mass @xmath62 which takes maximal value @xmath63 outside the bag and vanishes inside the bag .",
    "the quarks are confined , getting inside the bag a more favorable energetic position , and this is the principal idea of the confinement mechanism .        for gravitating bag model consistent with the kn solution , we follow this field mechanism , but must apply it `` inside out '' to have unbroken vacuum for gravitational and em kn solution in external region . thus , as agreed with the external gravitational and em field of the kn solution , the dirac equation will have inside the bag a nonzero bare mass @xmath64 and splits in the weyl basis into the left and right chiral parts , for spinors of the dirac bispinor @xmath65 ^ _ i _ |^= m _ , |^ i _ _ = m |^ , [ dir ] .outside the bag , @xmath66 the mass vanishes and these equations become independent ^ _ i _ |^=0 , |^ i _ _ = 0 .",
    "[ dir0 ] it must be consistent with spinor structure of the external kn solution which is determined by the kerr theorem @xcite . the kerr - schild ( ks ) form of kn solution may be represented in via the both kerr congruences outgoing @xmath67 or ingoing @xmath68 but not via the both ones simultaneously .",
    "taking for the _ physical sheet _ of the kn solution the outgoing kerr congruence @xmath69 corresponding to the retarded em field , we obtain the metric @xmath70 , and note that the advanced fields becomes inconsistent with this physical sheet , and being aligned with another congruence @xmath68 they should be positioned on the separate sheet which different metric @xmath71 .",
    "this problem disappears inside the bag , where @xmath72 , and the space is flat , @xmath73 and the difference between two metrics disappears .    due to",
    "consistency conditions the gravitational interaction drops out , and the dirac equations take the ordinary flat space - time form .",
    "the consistency conditions @xmath74 turn into equations for eigenfunctions of the helicity operator ( ) = , ( ) = - .",
    "[ align ] one sees that the spinors @xmath75 and @xmath76 have opposite helicity , forming the `` left - handed '' @xmath75 and `` right - handed '' helicity states , aligned with outgoing direction @xmath77 and ingoing direction @xmath78 correspondingly .",
    "the requirement of the consistency of the dirac solutions with kn solution enforces us to return the removed twosheetedness of the kerr geometry , this time to restore it outside the kn source .",
    "therefore , two massless weyl spinors @xmath79 and @xmath80 living on the different sheets of the external kn solution are joined at the flat space inside the bag and , obtaining mass from the yukawa coupling , they form the dirac bispinor .",
    "one more novelty for the dirac equation in the bag models is appearance of the variable mass term , which is determined by higgs condensate and turns out to be different for different regions of space - time .",
    "the dirac wave function , solution of the dirac equation with variable mass term , avoids the region with a large bare mass , and tends to get an energetically favorable position . in the slac bag model @xcite this problem",
    "is solved by variational approach .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is h(x ) = ^(1i + g ) [ ham ] , and the energetically favorable wave function has to be determined by minimization of the averaged hamiltonian @xmath81 under the normalization condition @xmath82 it yields ( 1i + g ) = e [ h - e ] , where @xmath83 appears as the lagrangian multiplier enforcing the normalization condition . similar to results of the slac - bag model , one expects that the dirac wave function will not penetrate deep in the region of large bare mass @xmath84 and will concentrate in a narrow transition zone at the bag border @xmath85 . as it motivated in @xcite , narrow concentration of the dirac wave function",
    "is admissible for scalar potential which does not lead to the klein paradox .",
    "the exact solutions of this kind are known only for two - dimensional case , and the corresponding variational problem should apparently be solved numerically by using the ansatz @xmath86 in which @xmath87 is a variable factor for the dirac solution based on the weyl spinors @xmath88 consistent with the corresponding outgoing and ingoing kerr congruences .",
    "taking the bag model conception , we should also accept the dynamical point of view that the bags are soft and may easily be deformed @xcite . by deformations bags may form stringy structures .",
    "the typical deformation of the bag models are radial and rotational excitations with formation of the string - like open flux - tubes . the old dirac s model of an `` extensible '' spherical electron @xcite",
    "may also be considered as a prototype of the bag model with spherically symmetric radial excitations .",
    "the bag - like source of the kn solution without rotation , @xmath89 turns into the dirac spherical `` extensible '' electron model with classical electron radius @xmath90 the disk - like bag of the kn rotating source may be considered as the dirac spherical bag stretched by rotation to the disk of compton radius , @xmath91 which corresponds to the zone of vacuum polarization of a `` dressed '' electron .",
    "the degree of oblateness of the kn bag is approximately @xmath92 in equatorial plane the boundary of the disk is very close to position of the kerr singular ring , field structure of which agrees with the structure of fundamental string , obtained by sen solution to low energy string theory @xcite .",
    "regularization of the kn source , gives to this string the cut - off parameter determined by ( [ re ] ) . in accord with @xcite",
    "this string may carry traveling waves created by the em excitations of the kn solution , and these waves must deform the bag surface .",
    "em excitations of the kerr background @xcite are determined by analytic function a= ( y,)/p^2 [ a ] where @xmath93 is a complex projective angular variable , @xmath94 is a complex retarded - time parameter and @xmath95 for ks geometry at rest .",
    "the ks vector potential is determined by function @xmath61 as follows @xcite = _",
    "dx^ + = - re  [ ( ) e^3 + d ] , [ alpha ] where @xmath96    the simplest solution @xmath97 is just the kn stationary solution , which creates a frozen circular em wave , which is locally plane and `` propagates '' along the kerr singular ring with the constant cut - off parameter @xmath98 , see fig.2a .",
    "it is a zero - mode excitation of the regularized kerr string . along with many other possible stringy waves ,",
    "interesting effect shows the simple wave solutions = e(1 + 1 y e^i ) .",
    "[ psi12 ] function @xmath61 acts on the metric through the function @xmath99 h =  .",
    "[ hpsi ] as we have seen in sec.2 , the condition @xmath100 determines the boundary of disk @xmath101 which acts as the cut - off parameter for em field .",
    "one sees that solution ( [ psi12 ] ) takes in equatorial plane @xmath102 the form @xmath103 and the cut - off parameter @xmath104 is not constant and vanishes at @xmath105 , creating a singular pole circulating along the kerr singular ring , @xmath106    this pole may be interpreted as a point - like bare electron in the state of zitterbewegung , or as a confined quark in the conception of the bag models .",
    "the mysterious problem of the source for two - sheeted kerr geometry leads to a gravitating soliton model , which has to retain the external kn solution .",
    "this condition can not be realized by the usual quadratic scheme of self - interacting higgs field and requires a supersymmetric model of phase transition , in which the higgs condensate breaks the gauge symmetry only in the core of the particle - like solution , leaving unbroken the external electromagnetic field of the kerr - newman solution .",
    "the resulting soliton model has much in common with the famous mit and slac bag models .",
    "in particular , the kn bag is compliant to deformations , and takes under rotations an oblate disk - like form with a circular string placed along the border of disk . for parameters of an electron the disk acquires the compton radius , indicating that the kn bag may be related to the compton region of vacuum polarization of a dressed electron .",
    "electromagnetic excitations of the kn bag , generated by stringy traveling waves , deform the bag and create a bag - string - quark system which gives explanation to mystery of zitterbewegung of the dirac electron .",
