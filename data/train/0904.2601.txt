    "the classical theory of homogenization is based on abstract operator convergence and deals with the asymptotic limit of a sequence of operators of the form parameterized by a small parameter @xmath7 .",

    "we also refer to @xcite for the original formulation based on asymptotic analysis and @xcite for a review .    instead of considering the homogenized limit of an @xmath7-family of operators of the form",
    ", we will construct in this paper a sequence of finite dimensional and low rank operators approximating   with arbitrary bounded @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , since no small parameter @xmath7 is introduced in the formulation , one has to understand homogenization in the context of finite dimensional approximation using a parameter @xmath10 that represents a computational scale determined by the available computational power and the desired precision .",
    "we are motivated by the fact that in most engineering problems , one has to deal with a given medium and not with an @xmath7-family of media .",
    "this observation gave rise to methods such as special finite element methods , metric based upscaling and harmonic change of coordinates considered in  @xcite .",
    "this point of view recovers not only results from classical homogenization with periodic or ergodic coefficients but also allows for homogenization of a given medium with arbitrary rough coefficients .",
    "in particular we need not make assumptions of ergodicity , scale separation and we do not need to introduce small parameter @xmath7 .    our formalism , in not relying on small parameter @xmath7 , is closely related to numerical homogenization which deals with coarse scale numerical approximations of solutions of   below . here",

    "first we show that conductivities @xmath5 can be put into one - to - one correspondence with , that is , can be parameterized by , symmetric definite positive divergence free matrices @xmath11 , and by convex functions @xmath12 as well ( section  [ khslkjdhdhklkjhe ] ) . while the transformation which maps @xmath5 into effective conductivities @xmath13 per coarse edge element is a highly non - linear transformation ( section  [ jhskdgkjsghdkj ] ) , we show that homogenization in the space of symmetric definite positive divergence free matrices @xmath11 acts as volume averaging , and hence is linear , while homogenization in the space of convex functions @xmath12 acts as a linear interpolation operator ( section  [ lksldhslkhsdlkhjej ] ) .",
    "moreover , we show that homogenization as it is formulated here is self - consistent and satisfies a semi - group property ( section  [ ksjdlkshdhksjdh ] ) .    hence , once formulated in the proper space , homogenization is a linear interpolation operator acting on convex functions .",
    "we apply this observation to construct optimally robust and stable algorithms for homogenizing divergence form equations with arbitrary rough coefficients by using weighted delaunay triangulations for linearly interpolating convex functions ( section  [ s : triangulate ] ) .",
    "figure  [ f : relationships ] summarizes relationships between the different parameterizations for conductivity we study .",
    "@xmath14    we use this new geometric framework for reducing the complexity of an inverse homogenization problem ( section  [ lshkdgshdgjjhdsg ] ) .",
    "inverse homogenization deals with the recovery of the physical conductivity @xmath5 from coarse scale information , for instance , from the set of effective conductivities .",
    "this problem is ill - posed insofar as it has no unique solution , and the space of solutions is a highly nonlinear manifold .",
    "we use this new geometric framework to re - cast inverse homogenization into an optimization problem within a linear space .",
    "we apply this result to electrical impedance tomography ( eit ) , the problem of computing @xmath5 from dirichlet and neumann data measured on the boundary of our domain .",
    "first , we provide a new method for solving eit problems through parameterization via convex functions .",
    "next we use this new geometric framework to obtain new theoretical results on the eit problem ( section  [ klcolhdckhcdeh ] ) .",
    "although the eit problem admits at most one isotropic solution , this isotropic solution may not exist if the boundary data have been measured on an anisotropic medium .",
    "we show that the eit problem admits a unique solution in the space of divergence - free matrices .",
    "the uniqueness property has also been obtained in @xcite . when conductivities are endowed with the topology of @xmath3-convergence",
    "the inverse conductivity problem is discontinuous when restricted to isotropic matrices @xcite and continuous when restricted to divergence - free matrices @xcite .",
    "if an isotropic solution exists we show here how to compute it for any conductivity having the same boundary data .",
    "this is of practical importance since the medium to be recovered in a real application may not be isotropic and the associated eit problem may not admit an isotropic solution but if such an isotropic solution exists it can be computed from the divergence - free solution by solving pde .    as such",
    ", we suggest that the space of divergence - free matrices parametrized by the space of convex functions is the natural space to look into for solutions of the eit problem .",
