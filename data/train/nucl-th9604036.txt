    "<S> vector mesons containing light quarks are thought to have their masses reduced in dense nuclear matter , sacrificing some of their energy to the scalar field which becomes appreciable at finite baryon density . </S>",
    "<S> model calculations find masses which fall by a couple tens of percents in normal nuclear matter , and by several hundred mev in dense matter . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the collision rate for rho mesons in such a scenario and at finite temperature . compared to its free - mass value , the collision rate changes by nearly a factor of two both above and below , depending on the density </S>",
    "<S> . this collision broadening effect could be important for estimates of low - mass dilepton production in heavy - ion collisions .    </S>",
    "<S> energetic heavy - ion collisions produce matter far the ground state and provide an exploratory workplace for ideas about strong interaction physics modifying particle properties . </S>",
    "<S> restoration of chiral symmetry is an example which could have dramatic effects on the overall dynamics of the collision by changing particle masses ( brown - rho scaling)@xcite , cross sections , propagation and decay rates . </S>",
    "<S> several issues remain unresolved . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , resonance spectral densities could become degenerate with their chiral partners , they could remain separate but mix very strongly or they could disappear altogether by effectively melting into continua . one popular picture is to couple nucleons to scalar and vector fields and to couple light vector mesons to the scalar field in a self - consistent manner . </S>",
    "<S> this walecka - type of approach leads to masses that drop nearly universally with increasing density@xcite and presumably become degenerate , or nearly so . </S>",
    "<S> however , any deviation from free space behavior is brief and unlikely observable in terms of hadronic signals since it is masked behind layers of complicated dynamics and spacetime evolutionary information redistribution . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> dilepton signals can in principle provide a clear snapshot of the isoscalar and neutral - isovector vector mesons since the electromagnetic quanta couple weakly to the hadronic medium . </S>",
    "<S> final spectra exhibit resonance structure which , in the low - mass region , includes rho and omega mesons . </S>",
    "<S> the natural width of the omega being 8.43 mev , dictates a lifetime which is too long for decay in the high density part of the evolution and so one turns to the rho meson for opportunity .    </S>",
    "<S> recent dielectron measurements have reported an enhancement in the low - mass region for 200 gev / u s+au collisions at the super proton synchrotron as compared with expected yields from hadronic decays@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement was most clear around 400 mev mass and one possible explanation among those proposed@xcite is that the rho mass drops in the early , high density stage of the evolution and provides a component to the dielectron signal much below its free mass@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> later stages of evolution support lower densities and consequently higher rho meson masses and will provide dielectron components all the way up to a free - space rho distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the question we address here is the relative importance of collision broadening in such a picture .    to further motivate and quantify the dropping mass scenario , we imagine a system of baryons , pseudoscalar , vector and axial - vector mesons at temperature @xmath0 and baryon density @xmath1 , and we look to models of the in - medium hadronic properties . </S>",
    "<S> they include qcd sum - rule approaches@xcite , effective field theories based largely on particle - hole polarization effects@xcite , quark models@xcite and mean - field or walecka - type models@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a trend they seem to share is the dropping mass at finite density . in the walecka - type approach , the nucleons couple to vector and scalar fields while the light vector mesons couple only to the scalar field since they are composed of quark and antiquark giving counterbalancing contributions . for given baryon density , </S>",
    "<S> the energy density @xmath2 is a function of the scalar field @xmath3 . by locating the extrema of @xmath4 , </S>",
    "<S> one establishes the strength of the scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> then the constituent quark model@xcite together with weinberg sum rules@xcite for relating @xmath5 and @xmath6 masses give , for example , @xmath7 where the starred quantities are in - medium values and @xmath8 is a coupling constant determined by balancing the repulsive vector and attractive scalar influences in order to reproduce bulk properties of nuclear matter . ignoring medium modifications to pions and kaons then leads to a picture of baryon , vector and axial - vector meson masses all dropping with increasing density . at this stage , </S>",
    "<S> choosing a specific effective rho mass determines the scalar field which in turn , determines the density . for </S>",
    "<S> given scalar field , all other hadron masses are then determined . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore a well defined question in this model to ask for the collision rate at fixed @xmath0 as a function of effective rho mass from @xmath9 = 770 mev down to the two - pion threshold .    </S>",
    "<S> collision rates are most conveniently estimated in a fireball model and from kinetic theory rather than some sort of dynamic model . </S>",
    "<S> this approach has been carried out to a rather extensive level for @xmath5 , @xmath10 and @xmath11-mesons interacting with pseudoscalar and light vector mesons@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interactions were parametrized according to the simplest lagrangians respecting proper symmetries and then calibrated to give the free - space decays . </S>",
    "<S> tree level feynman graphs were enumerated and computed all while checking unitarity bounds and including form factors to account for the composite nature of the particles . </S>",
    "<S> collision rates for @xmath5 and @xmath10 were found to be numerically similar and ranged from 40120 mev as the temperature varied from 150200 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the completeness of the calculation was crucial to getting the @xmath11 result of 1025 mev since there are no strong resonances . </S>",
    "<S> but for @xmath5 and @xmath10 , even with many nonresonant contributions , the resonances dominated the cross sections and consequently , the rates . </S>",
    "<S> this simplifies things enormously since we can be satisfied with breit - wigner parametrizations for the cross sections and eliminate the need for all that complexity .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the system of an hadronic mixture of pions , kaons , rho mesons and nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> introduction of eta , omega or higher mass mesons does not change the results significantly . give them equilibrium distributions @xmath12 , having the flexibility of a chemical potential @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> it is probably true that an equilibrated system is not fully reached for all of these constituents in heavy - ion collisions , but for first estimates it is the most reasonable thing to assume . </S>",
    "<S> rho mesons scatter vigorously with pions through the @xmath14 resonance and with kaons through the @xmath15 , both of which are axial - vectors and carry isospin 1 and 1/2 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath16 mass is assumed to scale just like the @xmath6 s . </S>",
    "<S> rho - rho and rho - nucleon scattering give contributions which are very much smaller , so we will restrict attention only to pions and kaons .    </S>",
    "<S> ignoring final state suppression or enhancements and approximating with classical distributions , the average scattering rate is @xmath17 where the sum runs over @xmath18 , the @xmath19 s are degeneracies , @xmath20 is the particle density of a thermal population of rho mesons having mass @xmath21 and zero chemical potential , @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the usual kinematic function . for the cross sections we take breit - wigner functions and we compute energy dependent widths . </S>",
    "<S> as the masses drop , phase space changes which naturally has modifying effects on the widths and cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest lagrangian respecting both gauge invariance and minimal pion derivatives is chosen for the axial - vector  vector  pseudoscalar ( a - v - p ) interactions . </S>",
    "<S> it has been used for photon@xcite and dilepton@xcite production estimates and is known to be reliable . </S>",
    "<S> the form of the interaction and the resulting strong decay rates are @xmath24 \\label{eq : decay}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the center of mass momentum of the decay products . </S>",
    "<S> cross sections are taken to be @xmath27\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the spin factor ratio is 1 for both @xmath28 and @xmath29 scattering through @xmath6 and @xmath16 resonances , respectively . the scattering rate of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : rate ] ) is now a function of temperature , chemical potentials and hadron masses . </S>",
    "<S> here we assume chemical equilibrium with a single potential @xmath30 , and with the rho chemical potential determined solely from it . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned previously , choosing a value of effective rho mass determines the effective masses for the other hadrons as well .    in fig.[fig : </S>",
    "<S> one ] we show the rate at @xmath0 = 150 mev as a function of the rho mass choosing two values of pion chemical potential ( 0 and 130 mev ) . in the free - mass extreme and zero chemical potential case </S>",
    "<S> , we can check against the rho collision rate of @xmath31 40 mev computed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with more sophisticated means . </S>",
    "<S> the two are consistent to within 5@xmath32% , so the present approach is quite satisfactory . </S>",
    "<S> as the rho mass drops from its free - space value of 770 mev , the collision rate rises to a maximum of 75 mev for a mass around 500 mev . </S>",
    "<S> from here it drops to 40 mev at 400 mev mass and to 20 mev at 300 mev mass . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for the lightest rho mesons considered here , the collision broadening is clearly not important . on the other hand , for intermediate rho masses </S>",
    "<S> the collision rates reach 75175 mev depending on the pion chemical potential . under these circumstances , </S>",
    "<S> collision broadening is most certainly important .    </S>",
    "<S> we recompute at a higher temperature of 200 mev and show the results in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : two ] . the rate for a free mass and zero chemical potential is @xmath31 140 mev . </S>",
    "<S> this is about 15% higher than the result of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and due to the differences in the cross sections used here . </S>",
    "<S> the peak in the rate seen at low temperature is largely smeared out since the average scattering energies are higher here and are therefore able to access the resonance peaks more easily . </S>",
    "<S> the key elements for determining the rate are the positions and widths of the resonances compared to the average @xmath33 for individual scatterings . in this higher temperature result the resonances are accessed equally well down to 500 mev mass and from there start to drop off the tail of the resonance distributions . at @xmath0= 150 </S>",
    "<S> mev , on the other hand , as the mass drops the resonance is accessed more favorably and it is in fact narrower and more noticeably spiked , thereby giving a boost to the rate .    </S>",
    "<S> we have computed the collision rate of the rho meson in hot and dense hadronic matter as a function of the effective rho mass or alternatively and equivalently , as a function of density . at @xmath0 = 150 mev and low densities </S>",
    "<S> the rate is @xmath34 40 mev . as the density increases and the mass drops </S>",
    "<S> , the rate rises to about twice @xmath35 , peaks and then drops to about half @xmath35 near the two - pion threshold . </S>",
    "<S> since mass resolution in the current dilepton experiments is roughly 10% , rho meson collision rates of a few tens of mev are not too important since the two effects ( resolution and collision broadening ) add in quadrature . at higher temperatures </S>",
    "<S> we have seen the rates rise to more than 100 to 250 mev depending if a chemical potential is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> both values are significant and suggest that collision broadening could be quite important for model calculations of low - mass dileptons when quantitative interpretation of experiment is attempted . </S>"
