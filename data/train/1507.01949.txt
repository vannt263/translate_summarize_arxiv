    "m67 ( ngc  2682 ) is one of the few old and rich open clusters in our galaxy , and therefore is central to our understanding of stellar evolution , stellar dynamics and star cluster evolution .",
    "m67 is located at @xmath10 ( j2000 ) . with an age of about 4 gyr @xcite and a half - mass relaxation time of about 100 myr @xcite , m67 is a highly dynamically evolved system .",
    "importantly , m67 is relatively nearby , with recent distance measurements ranging from between about 800 pc to 900 pc @xcite , and has low extinction , with recent @xmath11 determinations between 0.015 and 0.056 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , most studies agree that m67 has a roughly solar metallicity , with recent [ fe / h ] values ranging from -0.10 to + 0.05 @xcite .",
    "thus m67 provides a large sample of solar - type dwarf and evolved stars that are easily accessible to a variety of ground - based ( and space - based ) observations .",
    "indeed , m67 has been extensively studied through photometry from x - rays to near - ir @xcite , including several time - series optical photometric surveys @xcite .",
    "these surveys have revealed many intriguing stars , some of which lie far from the standard single - star evolutionary sequence in a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .    in order to interpret these observations , kinematic membership probabilities are paramount .",
    "there have been a number of proper - motion surveys of m67 ( @xcite , and see also @xcite ) , to various limiting magnitudes and spatial extents .",
    "there have also been a few radial - velocity ( rv ) surveys @xcite .",
    "surveys such as these have confirmed the kinematic cluster memberships of a rich population of blue straggler stars ( bss ; residing blueward of and generally brighter than the main - sequence turnoff ) , yellow giants ( residing between the bss region and the normal giant sequence ) , and `` sub - subgiants '' ( residing to the red of the main sequence but fainter than the subgiant branch , and also known as `` red stragglers '' ) , among the kinematic cluster members ( see figure  [ fig : cmd ] and section  [ sub : snote ] ) .",
    "numerous theoretical efforts have aimed to explain the origins of these exotic stars through studies of the dynamical evolution of m67 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies show that close stellar encounters , and particularly those involving binary stars , may be relatively frequent in m67 and can lead to the creation of exotic stars similar to those observed in the true cluster .",
    "furthermore , these models emphasize the importance of binaries to the dynamical evolution of the cluster .    to date",
    ", the published results of the binary population in m67 has been limited .",
    "the largest study of binaries in m67 is that of @xcite , who observed a sample of bright ( @xmath12 ) proper - motion members , and present orbits for 22 spectroscopic binaries . we have continued to monitor these and other stars in m67 in order to extend our sample of detected binaries ( and those with orbital solutions ) to longer orbital periods , fainter magnitudes and a larger distance from the cluster center .",
    "a progress report summarizing the characteristics of 85 spectroscopic binaries was presented at the general assembly of the iau in prague @xcite .    here",
    "we present results from our ongoing rv survey of the cluster . to date",
    "we have obtained 13776  rv measurements of 1278  stars in m67 with @xmath13 ( about 1.34  m@xmath2  to 0.76  m@xmath2 ) and extending spatially to 30 arcmin in radius from the cluster center ( 7.4 pc in projection at a distance of 850 pc , or approximately 6 to 7 core radii ) .",

    ". therefore our sample extends to between approximately 6 and 7 core radii . ]",
    "our stellar sample spans from the brightest stars in the cluster down to 4 magnitudes below the main - sequence turnoff .",
    "also for reference , @xcite find a half - mass radius for stars in our observed magnitude range in m67 of about 10 to 11 arcmin .",
    "tidal radius estimates for the cluster range from 50 arcmin to 100 arcmin @xcite .    in section",
    "[ sec : sample ] , we define our stellar sample in detail , and in sections  [ sec : obs ]  and  [ sec : data ] we describe our observations and the completeness of our data . in short ,",
    "our observations are nearly complete within our `` primary sample '' of stars with @xmath7 and within 30 arcmin from the cluster center . within this primary sample , we have at least one rv measurement for all but one star and at least 3 rv measurements for all but four stars ( two of which are rapid rotators ) . none of these four stars with @xmath14 rv measurements in our primary sample are proper - motion members ; moreover , we have at least three rv measurements for all proper - motion members in our primary stellar sample .",
    "our time baseline of observations for some stars reaches to over 40 years .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we use a cutoff of at least 3 rv measurements before attempting to derive rv membership probabilities and variability statistics .",
    "extensive monte carlo analyses by @xcite and @xcite indicate that 3 rv measurements over the course of at least one year is sufficient to detect nearly all binaries with orbital periods of less than @xmath15 days . with our observations , we can detect binaries with significantly longer periods , out to @xmath16 days .",
    "the detection of binaries is particularly important for determining reliable rv membership probabilities . in general , binaries without rv orbital solutions do not yield precise rv membership probabilities , due to their unknown center - of - mass ( @xmath17- ) rvs .",
    "we discuss our identification of binaries and cluster members in section  [ sec : results ] , and we present a summary table of our results for each observed star in table  [ rvtab ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : disc ] we use our cluster members to investigate the cmd ( cleaned from field star contamination ) , a few stars of note , the projected radial distribution of different cluster populations , and the velocity dispersion and virial mass of the cluster . then in section",

    "the target sample expanded substantially to include all @xcite members to @xmath23 , and all members in the cluster core ( radius @xmath24 arcmin ) to @xmath25 ( only observable with the mmt ) , totaling 432 stars .",
    "the last surviving cfa digital speedometer , on the 1.5-m tillinghast reflector , was retired in the summer of 2009 . over the following five observing seasons the new tillinghast reflector echelle spectrograph ( tres )",
    "was used to continue the rv observations of targets ( mostly binaries ) from both the cfa and the wiyn samples . whenever the observations accumulating for a target suggested that the velocity was not constant",
    ", additional observations were scheduled at a frequency designed to reveal its orbital parameters .",
    "for some systems the cfa observations span almost 35 years .",
    "importantly , roger griffin and james gunn also had a rv program for m67 from 1971 to 1982 at the palomar hale 5 m telescope , which they supplemented with contemporaneous observations obtained with the coravel instrument at haute provence for five of the binaries .",
    "their target sample was very similar to our initial sample , and the combination of the two data sets to expand the time baseline was a natural and straightforward step .",
    "the integration of the palomar and coravel data with the cfa data is discussed in detail in @xcite , where the entirety of the palomar data as well as the cfa data to that date are presented , and in @xcite .",
    "hereinafter , we will refer to the target stars and the measurements taken at all telescope / instrument pairs except wiyn / hydra as the cfa sample and data .",
    "as of february 2015 , there are 447 stars in the cfa sample . the radius  @xmath26-magnitude distribution of the stars observed by these telescopes",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : cfasamp ] ( top ) , and the middle and bottom panels of the same figure present the chronology of observations graphically .",
    "+   +   +    as evident in figure  [ fig : cfasamp ] , the cfa sample is not comprehensive in radius for the fainter stars in the sample . furthermore , the @xcite proper - motion study was progressively more incomplete and less precise with increasing magnitude .",
    "the hydra multi - object spectrograph ( mos ) on the wiyn 3.5 m telescope , combined with modern target lists , has been able to provide a complete magnitude and spatially limited sample , as described here .",
    "wiyn observations of m67 began on january 15 , 2005 as part of the wiyn open cluster study ( wocs ; * ? ? ?",
    "the current wiyn target list contains all stars with @xmath27 and within 30 arcminutes in radius from the cluster center .",

    "we can derive reliable rvs with our wiyn observing setup for stars with @xmath28 .",
    "( rapid rotation and a diminished number of absorption features often hinders our ability to derive precise rvs for earlier - type stars . )",
    "the only stars in m67 that are bluer than this limit and bright enough to be within our sample are bss . because of their scientific interest",
    ", we included these stars in the wiyn stellar sample . in total",
    "there are 1278 stars within the wiyn stellar sample ; 382 of these stars are also in the cfa stellar sample .",

    "initially we chose to make use of wiyn s advantage at faint magnitudes and prioritized stars from @xmath29 .",
    "( the hydra mos has a dynamic range limit of 4 mag . ) later , to improve the completeness of our observations within the combined wiyn and cfa sample , we extended our wiyn sample to include all stars within a 30 arcminute radius from the cluster center and with @xmath27 .",
    "for a few epochs , we focused exclusively on the brighter stars in our list in order to build this complete sample .",
    "we also note that we removed from our sample the few high - proper - motion stars in the m67 field whose coordinates have changed significantly during the course of our survey , as these stars are certainly not cluster members .",
    "details about the telescopes , observing procedures , and data reductions of spectra obtained with the cfa digital speedometers can be found in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding information for spectra obtained with hydra at the wiyn observatory can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we describe briefly here the tres instrument and observations .",
    "tres is a stabilized fiber - fed echelle spectrograph with a ccd detector and resolution of 44,000 .",
    "procedures were adopted to ensure that the rvs from tres could be adjusted to the native velocity system of the cfa digital speedometers .",
    "although tres delivers wavelength coverage from 390 to 900 nm , only the order centered on the mg b features was used to derive rvs in order to match the spectral region used by the cfa digital speedometers , using the same library of synthetic template spectra for the correlation analysis . to establish the zero point offset between the tres and cfa digital speedometer rvs , observations of the afternoon blue sky and of selected iau standards",
    "were obtained on most nights .",
    "there were several modifications to tres during the first years of its operation , and corresponding zeropoint shifts as large as 0.1  km  s@xmath0  were measured . since march 2012",
    "the tres zeropoint has been stable at the level of about 0.01  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the tres velocities are all ( initially ) shifted by the gravitational redshift of the sun and blueshift of the earth , because the library of templates does not include either of those effects",
    ". therefore the derived stellar velocities are all redshifted by the net amount , nominally @xmath30  km  s@xmath0 , which we subtract out . furthermore",
    ", the native cfa digital speedometer velocity system is shifted by @xmath31  km  s@xmath0  compared to the iau system @xcite . the actual correction to get the tres velocities onto the native cfa system",
    "is observed to be @xmath32  km  s@xmath0 , very close to @xmath33  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "we report tres velocities on this native cfa system .",
    "we do not apply any shift to the wiyn rvs , and , as noted in section  [ sec : data ] , we do not detect any significant zero - point shift between the wiyn rvs and the native cfa system . therefore by construction , all rvs reported here , as well as the mean rv of the cluster , are on the native cfa system .      in order to detect binaries ( and higher - order systems ) , we require multiple observations at multiple epochs with known rv precisions .",
    "our sample contains observations of mainly narrow - lined stars within a modest magnitude range , but taken at multiple different telescopes with different instruments . therefore to facilitate our subsequent analysis of binarity ( section  [ sub : vvar ] )",
    ", we estimate single - measurement precision values for rvs derived from each respective telescope .    the majority of the cfa measurements come from the mmt and the tillinghast reflector ( both using the digital speedometers ) .",
    "we follow the same procedure as @xcite to empirically determine the typical single - measurement precision for observations made at these two telescopes and at the wiyn observatory with hydra .",
    "specifically we fit a @xmath34 distribution of two degrees of freedom to the distribution of standard deviations of the first three rv measurements for each single - lined star in these samples , respectively .",
    "the results for all stars observed @xmath35 times at these telescopes are shown in figures  [ fig : eoi ] .",
    "the dashed lines in each panel of figure  [ fig : eoi ] show the best fitting @xmath34 distribution functions , respectively , which yield typical single - measurement precision values of 0.8  km  s@xmath0  for rvs from the tillinghast reflector + ds , 0.7  km  s@xmath0  for rvs from the mmt , and 0.5  km  s@xmath0  for rv from wiyn .",
    "these single - measurement rv precision values for the cfa telescopes are in good agreement with those found by @xcite , and also agree with the value found by @xcite for observations of ngc 6819 taken at the mmt and the tillinghast reflector with the same instrumental setup .",
    "likewise , the single - measurement rv precision for observations at wiyn found here is similar to that found for the narrow - lined stars in ngc 188 , ngc 6819 and m35 observed with this same setup @xcite .",
    "+   +   +    for these three telescopes ( wiyn , mmt and tillinghast + ds ) , we also have sufficient data to characterize our rv precision as a function of @xmath26 magnitude ( which , in general , correlates with the signal - to - noise of the measurement for a given integration time ) .",
    "as also found by @xcite and @xcite the single - measurement rv precision degrades towards fainter magnitudes . in figure  [ fig : precv ] we show the single - measurement precision values resulting from @xmath36 distribution fits to observations from these three telescopes in bins of the stars @xmath26 magnitudes .",
    "the lines show linear fits to these data . to avoid unrealistic precision values",
    ", we impose a precision floor at the values in the bin containing the brightest stars , specifically at 0.4  km  s@xmath0  for wiyn rvs and 0.6  km  s@xmath0  for mmt and tillinghast + ds rvs .",
    "we then use these fit lines to determine our single - measurement precision values for stars observed at these telescopes ( given their respective @xmath26 magnitudes ) in later analyses .",
    "we also note that observations of the few rapidly rotating stars in our sample have poorer precision ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of the effects of stellar rotation on the wiyn rv precision ) .",
    "for these few stars , we do not attempt to derive single - measurement rv precisions .",
    "we lack sufficient observations on the remaining telescopes to reliably utilize the @xmath34 distribution fitting technique . for the palomar hale 5 m rvs ,",
    "the typical standard deviation of the measurements of a given star is 0.3 km  s@xmath0  @xcite ; we use this value as our single - measurement rv precision for stars observed at palomar . for observations from the wyeth 1.5 m",
    ", there are only 12 stars with at least three rv measurements , and a third of these stars are in binaries ( with orbital solutions ) .",
    "the mean of the standard deviations of the first three rvs for the remaining eight stars is 0.4  km  s@xmath0 , and we take this as an estimate of the single - measurement rv precision for observations from the wyeth .",
    "coravel and tres observations were primarily of binaries . for coravel rvs , we estimate the rv precision based on the @xmath37 residuals from the orbital fits in @xcite , and find a typical precision of 0.5  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the correction of the tres velocities for shifts in the instrumental zero - point from month to month and year to year is now reliable at the level of 0.02  km  s@xmath0  or better ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , much better than the precision achieved for most of our tres spectra of m67 stars due to snr limitations set by photon noise .",
    "nevertheless , most of our tres observations of slowly - rotating single - lined stars in m67 do yield a velocity precison on the order of 0.1 ( or perhaps 0.2 )  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "we assume a single - measurement rv precision of 0.1 km  s@xmath0  for tres observations of narrow - lined stars in the following analyses .",
    "tres observations of rapidly - rotating stars have proven to be much more precise than the results for the same stars observed with the cfa digital speedometers .",
    "we attribute this to the higher snr and better wavelength coverage provided by tres .",
    "in particular , tres has allowed us to derive reliable rvs for two of the rapidly rotating bss in m67 that eluded success with our other facilities .",
    "the long tails in the distributions extending beyond the best fitting curves shown in figure  [ fig : eoi ] are populated by binary ( and higher - order ) systems . moreover , because the standard deviation of the rvs from a binary should be significantly larger than the single - measurement rv precision , we use the results of this analysis to identify binaries in our sample .",
    "we discuss our criteria for identifying binaries in section  [ sub : vvar ] .",
    "the palomar velocities were adjusted to the native cfa velocity system as described in @xcite . here",
    "we check for a possible zero - point offset between the wiyn and cfa data by comparing the mean rvs for non - rv variable stars in both samples .",
    "specifically we select only those stars that have three or more observations in both samples , with @xmath380.01 and @xmath39@xmath14 ( we discuss the derivation of these quantities in section  [ sub : vvar ] ) .",
    "there are 95 such stars in our sample , and for each of these stars we calculate the mean rv from each sample .",
    "the mean rvs for stars in the cfa sample that have observations at multiple telescopes are weighted by the respective precision values discussed above .",
    "we then calculate the star - by - star difference in the mean rvs , defined as @xmath40 , and find a mean difference of 0.008  km  s@xmath0 , with a standard error of the mean of 0.06  km  s@xmath0 . as this difference is well below the rv precision of any telescope used here ( and less than the magnitude of the offset of the native cfa system from the iau system , as discussed in section  [ sec : obs ] ) , we conclude that there is no significant zero - point offset at this level between the wiyn and cfa rvs .",
    "we therefore proceed in combining the two data sets without modification , and use this combined data set for the following analyses . in total",
    "there are 8023  rvs of 455  stars from the cfa and 5753  rvs of 1163  stars from wiyn for a total of 13776  rvs of 1278  stars in m67 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : jdhist ] we plot a histogram of the maximum time span of rv measurements for the stars in our m67 sample ( with at least 2 observations ) .",
    "for some stars , our observations span @xmath4140 years , and about one third of the stars in our sample have observations spanning at least 10 years .",
    "this long time baseline facilitates the detection of long - period binaries in our sample .",
    "again , we discuss our binary detection method in section  [ sub : vvar ] .      we define a `` primary stellar sample '' which extends from the brightest stars in the cluster to @xmath7 and out to a 30 arcmin radius from the cluster center . in total , there are 903 stars in our primary sample .",
    "we have at least one rv measurement for 902 of these stars , and @xmath53 rv measurements for 899 of these stars .",

    "1016 is the brightest star in our sample and is a proper - motion non - member from three sources .",
    "we have two observations of 1016 that are outside of the cluster rv distribution .",
    "we have observed 7033 and 7054 multiple times , and they both appear to be rapid rotators . we have been unable to derive reliable rvs from the majority of these measurements .",

    "singles are stars classified as sm , and binaries are classified as either bm , blm or bu .    a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test shows that the main - sequence binaries are centrally concentrated with respect to the main - sequence single stars at the 98.7% confidence level .",
    "comparing all single stars to all binaries shows that the binaries are more centrally concentrated at the 99.8% confidence level .",
    "because the total mass of a given binary is generally more massive than that of a single star in our primary sample , this results confirms that m67 is mass segregated .",
    "@xcite find the bss to be centrally concentrated with respect to the single stars near the cluster turnoff .",
    "our bss sample is slightly different than that of @xcite . nonetheless , the result is the same .",
    "a k - s test comparing the bss to the single main - sequence stars show that the bss are centrally concentrated at the 99.7% confidence level .",
    "this result suggests that the bss are more massive than the main - sequence stars in the cluster , as was noted by @xcite .    in many globular clusters and also the old open cluster ngc 188 ,",
    "bss show a bimodal projected radial distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we do not observe evidence for a bimodal radial distribution in our m67 bss sample .",
    "however , our sample only extends to 6 or 7 core radii . in ngc 188 , which is of a similar dynamical age to m67",
    ", the halo bss population begins at roughly 6 core radii and extends to about 13 core radii ( at least ) .",
    "thus if m67 and ngc 188 have similar bss radial distributions , we would only expect to see the inner population of m67 in our current sample , and would require a survey extending to roughly twice the current radial extent to search for a bimodal structure .",
    "interestingly , the giants appear to follow a similar spatial distribution as the binaries , despite having very similar masses to the upper main - sequence stars included in our primary sample .",
    "however , given the relatively small sample size of the single giants , a k - s test comparing the spatial distributions of the single giants and single main - sequence stars returns a distinction at only the 95.9% confidence level .",
    "for comparison , the ngc 188 giants do not follow the distribution of the binaries , and instead follow closely to the single cluster members ( see figure 9 in * ? ? ? * ) , both when considering the entire spatial extent of the rv survey and when limiting to a similar number or core radii as our m67 sample .",
    "this difference is intriguing , but the small sample sizes of the giants in both clusters make such comparisons uncertain .",
    "we follow the method of @xcite to calculate the rv dispersion of the m67 single main - sequence , subgiant and giant members in our primary sample .",
    "( we exclude the binaries and bss because these have significantly different spatial distributions , likely due to their higher masses . )",
    "this method assumes that the observed rv dispersion is composed of two components , one which we will call the `` combined rv dispersion '' and one for the observational error , and also assumes that the distributions of rvs and errors are gaussian . the observed dispersion is directly measured , and by subtracting off the component from observational error , we recover the combined rv dispersion .",
    "the combined rv dispersion itself contains contributions from both the true rv dispersion of the cluster and undetected binaries , which also artificially inflates the observed rv dispersion .",
    "we aim to recover the true rv dispersion from our data .",
    "first we calculate the observed rv dispersion , which is simply the standard deviation of the observed mean rvs for each star about the cluster mean rv ( calculated in section  [ sub : membership ] ) . in our calculation",
    ", we use the weighted mean rvs for each star in the given sample ( see table  [ rvtab ] ) , which utilize the single - measurement precision values from the given telescope for each individual rv value ( see section  [ sub : prec ] ) . for the single main - sequence , subgiant and giant stars in our primary sample ,",
    "the resulting observed velocity dispersion is @xmath95  km  s@xmath0 . after correcting for the observational error ( following the method of @xcite and @xcite ) ,",
    "we find a combined rv dispersion of @xmath6  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "we then follow a similar method to that of @xcite to correct this combined rv dispersion for the contribution from undetected binaries .",
    "briefly , we run a monte carlo analysis to create many realizations of our m67 observations . for each realization , we generate a population of synthetic single and binary stars ( given an input binary frequency ) , and produce synthetic rvs for these stars on the true observing dates from our m67 survey , which we analyze in the same manner as our real observations .",
    "we run this analysis for a range of true rv dispersion values , and for each value , we derive the difference between the synthetic combined rv dispersion and the input true rv dispersion .",
    "this difference is the contribution from undetected binaries ( @xmath96 in equation  5 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for this analysis ,",
    "we improve upon the technique of @xcite in our treatment of the binaries , and therefore , for clarity , we explain the method in some further detail here . in order to recover the true velocity dispersion",
    ", we must also estimate the binary frequency of the cluster .",
    "we use a similar monte carlo method to @xcite to account for our incompleteness in binary detections out to the hard - soft boundary . as in @xcite , we assume that the orbital parameters of the m67 binaries follow the same distributions as observed for the solar - type binaries in the galactic field from @xcite , except here we use a circularization period of 12.1 days @xcite .",
    "we also make a few updates to the method of @xcite .",
    "first , rather than choosing one specific primary mass , we draw from an inferred primary - mass distribution within our m67 primary sample ( derived by comparisons to a @xcite isochrone ) .",
    "second , we attempt to recreate the correlation between binary mass ratio and orbital period observed for field binaries by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure  17 and related discussion ) .",
    "specifically , for binaries with periods between 100 days and 1000 years , we choose mass ratios from a uniform distribution with 10% of systems having a mass ratio of unity ( e.g. , twins ) . for binaries with periods greater than 1000 years",
    "we draw mass ratios from a uniform distribution limited to be less than 0.95 . for binaries with periods",
    "less than 100 days , we enforce @xmath6319% to have mass ratios between 0.2 and 0.45 , @xmath6344% to have mass ratios between 0.45 and 0.9 , and the remainder to have mass ratios between 0.9 and 1 , all drawn from uniform distributions between the respective mass ratio limits . finally , we limit the field log - normal orbital period distribution so that the binaries are detached ( using radii estimates from a @xcite isochrone ) , and the periods are less than the hard - soft boundary .",
    "the assumed location of the hard - soft boundary , which is at roughly @xmath97-@xmath98 days in m67 , is especially important for the undetected binary correction .",
    "we do not expect to detect binaries at these long periods .",
    "furthermore , the hard - soft boundary is near the peak of the log - normal distribution , and therefore the assumed binary frequency is particularly sensitive to this cutoff .",
    "we estimate the hard - soft boundary as the location where a synthetic binary s binding energy is equal to the kinetic energy of a `` typical '' star moving at an assumed velocity dispersion . for the mass of this typical star",
    ", we take the mean mass of an object ( single or total mass of a binary ) from the @xcite @xmath99-body simulation of m67 , which at 4 gyr is 0.95  m@xmath2 . we then assume a velocity dispersion , run our analysis to derive the true velocity dispersion in our m67 sample ( given the resulting hard - soft boundary and total binary frequency ) , and iterate until this assumed velocity dispersion is @xmath100  km  s@xmath0  different from the derived true velocity dispersion in m67 ( a somewhat arbitrary limit meant to be roughly equivalent to the precision with which we can measure the velocity dispersion ) . as a starting guess , we use the combined dispersion value of 0.80  km  s@xmath0 , found above .",
    "our analysis of the single main - sequence , giant and sub - subgiant stars in this sample requires only two iterations .",
    "the resulting orbital period distribution matches closely to those predicted by the @xmath99-body open cluster models of @xcite and @xcite , and we estimate the total binary frequency in our sample to be 57%  @xmath67  4% . we derive a true velocity dispersion , after correcting for measurement error and undetected binaries , for the m67 single main - sequence stars , subgiants and giants with @xmath7 of @xmath8  km  s@xmath0 .    using a subsample of 20 of the brightest stars in our sample",
    ", @xcite measured a cluster rv dispersion , after correcting for measurement errors , of @xmath101  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "after also correcting for undetected binaries ( assuming a 50% binary frequency ) , @xcite find an rv dispersion of @xmath102  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite show that this rv dispersion increases to @xmath103  km  s@xmath0  ( corrected for both measurement errors and undetected binareis ) when including the larger sample from @xcite , in good agreement with the result we find here .",
    "more recently , @xcite derive an rv dispersion for main - sequence stars in m67 with @xmath104 of @xmath105  km  s@xmath0 , and for m67 giants of @xmath106  km  s@xmath0 , using harps spectra with a typical precision of @xmath6310 m s@xmath0  ( not corrected for undetected binaries ) .",
    "if we divide our sample into the sm main - sequence stars with @xmath104 and sm giant stars , after correcting for measurement errors , we find a combined velocity dispersion for the main - sequence stars of @xmath107  km  s@xmath0  and for giants of @xmath108  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "however , the main - sequence stars have a much higher binary frequency than the giants , and therefore a much larger correction for undetected binaries . after correcting for both measurement errors and undetected binaries",
    ", we find a true velocity dispersion for main - sequence stars ( @xmath104 ) of @xmath109  km  s@xmath0  and for giants of @xmath110  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "thus we find essentially identical velocity dispersions for the main - sequence and giant stars .",
    "we note that padova isochrones indicate a mean mass for the main - sequence stars in this sample of 1.11  m@xmath2  ( with a standard deviation of 0.10 m@xmath2 ) , and for the giants of 1.33  m@xmath2  ( with a standard deviation of 0.01 m@xmath2 ) ; our sample covers only a narrow mass range .",
    "one - dimensional proper - motion dispersion measurements from the literature are somewhat higher than these rv dispersions ( as was also noted by * ? ? ?",

    "as discussed above , the @xcite proper motions have the highest precision , and therefore here we will compare directly to their result .",
    "after correcting for undetected binaries , our true rv dispersion measurement differs from the @xcite proper - motion dispersion measurement at about the @xmath114 level ( without accounting for an additional uncertainty on the proper - motion dispersion from the range in cluster distances quoted in the literature ) .",
    "given the uncertainties on these measurements , the different distances assumed in converting from angular proper motions to km  s@xmath0 , and the different methods used to account for measurement error in the proper - motion dispersions , we conclude that the rv and proper - motion dispersions are in agreement at our level of precision .",
    "we have also examined the true rv dispersion of m67 as a function of radius from the cluster center , shown in figure  [ fig : vdisp ] .",
    "we divide this sample of main - sequence , subgiant and giant single members into five equal bins in radius .",
    "crosses , open circles and filled circles show the observed , combined and true rv dispersion values , respectively , at each bin in radius .",
    "the correction for undetected binaries is highest in the inner - most bin , as this bin has the highest binary frequency , consistent with our finding that the binaries are mass segregated with respect to the single stars ( see figure  [ fig : spatdist ] ) .",
    "the radial distribution of the true velocity dispersion within the parameter space covered by our survey is consistent with an isothermal distribution .",
    "@xcite find an increase in the proper - motion dispersion as a function of radius , although they note that this effect may be in part due to increased field - star contamination with radius in their sample .",
    "we do not see a similar trend in our data .",
    "we have also examined different binnings with no detectable effect on the results presented here .    given the velocity dispersion",
    ", we can estimate the mass of the cluster through the virial theorem . under the assumption that the cluster is in dynamical equilibrium ,",
    "the kinetic and potential energies are related by @xmath115 . from @xcite , if this equation is rewritten in terms of the half - mass radius ( @xmath116 ) , @xmath117 for most systems .",
    "also , for an isotropic velocity dispersion , the observed half - mass radius in projection is given by @xmath118 , and the one - dimensional rv dispersion is related to the rms velocity @xmath26 by @xmath119 .",
    "thus the virial mass of the cluster can be calculated by the equation :    @xmath120    @xcite find a half - mass radius of m67 for stars with @xmath121 of @xmath122  pc and for stars with @xmath123 of @xmath124  pc , assuming a distance of 850 pc .",
    "the m67 sample used here extends from @xmath125 to @xmath126 , though the vast majority of the stars have @xmath127 .",
    "we will assume a projected half - mass radius for the stars in our sample of @xmath128  pc .",
    "this value lies in the middle and extends to the limits of the range in @xmath129 found by @xcite for these two magnitude regimes .",
    "given our true rv dispersion above of @xmath130  km  s@xmath0 , we find a virial mass for m67 of @xmath9  m@xmath2 .",
    "this value is in good agreement with previous dynamical mass estimates .",
    "@xcite derive a virial mass of 1600  m@xmath2  ( with a @xmath111 upper limit of 4000  m@xmath2 ) , and a direct cluster mass of 1100  m@xmath2  based on star counts .",

    "@xcite calculate a mass of 1270  m@xmath2  within a radius of 2000 arcsec and including stars with masses @xmath132  m@xmath2 .",
    "these mass estimates ( including ours ) are somewhat higher than the mass estimates of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , who find cluster masses of 724  m@xmath2 , 553  m@xmath2  and 903  m@xmath2 , respectively , all through analyses of the cluster luminosity function .",
    "we interpret these measurements as lower limits on the true cluster mass , as each of these surveys were limited either in magnitude or radial extent .",
    "this is the first in a series of papers studying the dynamical state of the old open cluster m67 through precise rvs .",
    "here we focus on determining cluster membership and identifying binaries ( sections  [ sec : results ] ) within a complete sample of cluster stars . in total , we present results from 13776  rv measurements of 1278  stars in the direction of m67 spanning from the brightest stars in the cluster down to about 4 magnitudes below the main - sequence turnoff ( @xmath1 ) , covering a mass range of about 1.34  m@xmath2  to 0.76  m@xmath2 , and extending spatially to 30 arcmin in radius from the cluster center ( about 6 or 7 core radii ) .",
    "we combine rv measurements from multiple telescopes using different instruments , carefully accounting for their different single - measurement rv precisions ( see section  [ sub : prec ] ) .",
    "the vast majority of the stars in our sample have multiple epochs of rv measurements , allowing for the detection of binary companions .",
    "for some stars , the time span of our observations exceeds 40 years , and about one third of these stars have observations spanning at least 10 years .    in our analysis ,",
    "we require at least 3 rv measurements before attempting to determine rv variability or rv membership probabilities .",
    "we also utilize the proper - motion membership surveys of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to remove additional non - members from our cluster sample . using both proper - motion and",
    "rv membership information , we identify 562  cluster members within our sample , 142  of which show significant rv variability , indicative of a binary companion ( or multiple companions ) .",
    "we define a primary sample of stars with @xmath7 and within 30 arcmin from the cluster center , where we have @xmath53 rv measurements for all proper - motion members ( and , considering the entire primary sample , at least one rv measurement for all but 1 star and @xmath53 rv measurements for all but 4 stars ; see section  [ sub : comp ] ) .",
    "we then use this primary sample to construct a cmd cleaned from field - star contamination ( section  [ sub : cmd ] ) , identify and discuss a few notable stars ( section  [ sub : snote ] ) , compare the projected radial distributions of different cluster populations ( section  [ sub : spatdist ] ) , and determine the rv dispersion and virial mass of the cluster ( section  [ sub : vdisp ] ) .    within our cluster member sample ,",
    "we identify 14 bss , 4 bright `` yellow giants '' residing on the cmd between the typical bss region and the giant sequence ( though one is outside of a 30 arcminute radius from the cluster center ) , and 2 `` sub - subgiants '' located to the red of the main - sequence but fainter than the subgiant and giant branches .",
    "these `` exotic '' stars have a remarkably high binary frequency of ( at least ) 80% , as compared to 22.7% detected binaries amongst the rest of the sample .",
    "both the binaries and bss are significantly more centrally concentrated than the single stars ( i.e. , non - rv variables ) in our sample . within our sample",
    "the binaries are , on average , more massive than the single stars , and therefore this result confirms that m67 is mass segregated ( as also found by other authors ) , which is expected for a cluster that has lived through tens of relaxation times .",
    "as @xcite also discuss , the central concentration of the bss suggests that they too are more massive than the single stars in our sample , which is consistent with the predictions of theoretical formation channels . we do not observe a bimodal radial distribution for the bss , as is observed for bss in many globular clusters and those in the old open cluster ngc 188",
    "however , our sample only extends to roughly 6 or 7 core radii , and a larger radial extent would likely be required to detect a possible halo bss population and bimodal radial distribution .",
    "finally , we determine the rv dispersion of the single main - sequence , subgiant and giant members in our primary sample . accounting for measurement errors , we find a combined rv dispersion of @xmath6  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "when also corrected for the contribution from undetected binaries , we find a true rv dispersion of the cluster of @xmath8  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the radial distribution of the true rv dispersion within our sample is consistent with an isothermal distribution . using this true rv dispersion and a projected half - mass radius of @xmath128  pc ,",
    "we calculate a virial mass for m67 of @xmath9  m@xmath2 .",
    "our long - term rv survey of m67 enables a detailed study of the cluster s binary population , from the main - sequence through the giant branch and including the rich population of m67 bss .",

    "in particular , we have determined orbital solutions for 108  binary members of the cluster , which we will present and analyze in subsequent papers .",
    "additionally , we will study the binary properties of the bss in detail , which are critical for our understanding of their formation mechanism(s ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "binary stars play a primary role in the dynamical evolution of star clusters and the formation of exotic stars like bss . with the addition of the binary properties to the large body of existing observational work on the cluster",

    "<S> we derive radial - velocity membership probabilities and identify radial - velocity variables , finding 562  cluster members , 142  of which show significant radial - velocity variability . </S>",
    "<S> we use these cluster members to construct a color - magnitude diagram and identify a rich sample of stars that lie far from the standard single star isochrone , including the well - known blue stragglers , sub - subgiants and yellow giants . </S>",
    "<S> these exotic stars have a binary frequency of ( at least ) 80% , more than three times that detected for stars in the remainder of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that the cluster is mass segregated , finding the binaries to be more centrally concentrated than the single stars in our sample at the 99.8% confidence level ( and at the 98.7% confidence level when only considering main - sequence stars ) . </S>",
    "<S> the blue stragglers are centrally concentrated as compared to the solar - type main - sequence single stars in the cluster at the 99.7% confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> accounting for measurement precision , we derive a radial - velocity dispersion in m67 of @xmath6  km  s@xmath0  for our sample of single main - sequence stars , subgiants and giants with @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> when corrected for undetected binaries , this sample yields a true radial - velocity dispersion of @xmath8  km  s@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the radial distribution of the velocity dispersion is consistent with an isothermal distribution within our stellar sample . using the cluster radial - velocity dispersion </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate a virial mass for the cluster of @xmath9  m@xmath2 . </S>"
