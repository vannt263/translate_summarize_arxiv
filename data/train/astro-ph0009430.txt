    "tidal disruption of stars in the gravitational potential of massive black holes in the centers of galaxies has been recognized long ago as a way to prove the existence of massive black holes in otherwise non - active galaxies . during the tidal disruption",
    "about 50% of the mass of the star are stripped off and get unbound from the star ( mostly independent of impact parameter , masses and velocities ; ayal  2000 ) .",
    "this material can eventually be accreted by the black hole , leading to a flare of optical to x - ray emission lasting a few months to years . while originally proposed to explain the activity in agn ( hills 1975 ) , a first calculation of the frequency , temporal behaviour and spectral signatures of tidal disruption events ( frank & rees 1976 , young  1977 , kato & hoshi 1978 , lidskii & ozernoi 1979 , gurzadyan & ozernoi 1980 , gurzadyan & ozernoi 1981 ) revealed both , the potential of such events to learn more about the inner regions of galaxies as well as the problems in observing these rare events ( rees 1988 ) .    over the recent few years , tidal disruption",
    "has attracted renewed attention , both theoretically and observationally .",
    "loeb & ulmer ( 1997 ) have studied the case that a surrounding gaseous envelope could reprocess most of the radiation from the accretion process into a thermal spectrum of 10@xmath0 k , thus being easily detectable in optical surveys rather than in x - ray surveys .",
    "magorrian & tremaine ( 1999 ) have recalculated the stellar disruption rates in detailed dynamical models of real galaxies , taking into account the refilling of the loss cone of stars on disruptable orbits by two - body relaxation and tidal forces in non - spherical galaxies .",
    "ayal  ( 2000 ) have performed simulations of the long - term evolution of tidally disrupted stars and find that only about 10% of the stellar mass are actually accreted by the central black hole .",
    "on the observational side , the discovery of time - variable uv or x - ray emission in distant , otherwise non - active galaxies may provide the first indirect evidence of tidal disruption events . besides the early report on a uv flare in ngc 4552 ( renzini  1995 )",
    ", a few very good candidates have been detected with rosat during the recent years , such as the @xmath1 erg / s outburst in ngc 5905 ( bade  1996 , komossa & bade 1999 ) , the @xmath2 erg / s flare in rxj1242.61119 ( komossa & greiner 1999 ) , the @xmath3 erg / s flare in rxj1624.9 + 7554 ( grupe et al . 1999 ) , or the @xmath3 erg / s flare in rxj1331.93243 ( reiprich & greiner 2000 ) .",
    "interestingly , in all these rosat discoveries the x - ray spectrum of the flares is extremely soft , of the order of 50 - 100 ev effective temperature .",
    "the time scales of these events , though not in all cases well constrained , are of the order of months to years .",
    "all these properties , together with the fact that none of the corresponding galaxies shows any optical sign of activity have led to the tentative identification as being associated with disruption events .    here",
    "we report on the discovery of another transient x - ray source and the optical and x - ray follow - up observations .",
    "the search for supersoft x - ray sources in the rosat pspc all - sky - survey ( greiner 1996 ) revealed a few sources for which neither confirmation through a rosat follow - up observation nor a reasonable optical counterpart could be found .",
    "one of these sources is  @xmath4 1rxs j142024.4 + 533403 @xmath4 rbs 1376 ( schwope  2000 ) .",
    "it was detected during the pspc all - sky - survey between december 58 , 1990 at a count rate of 0.28 cts / s , resulting in the collection of a total of 255 counts .",
    "there is no significant short - term variability within the 3 day scanning coverage .",
    "the source position has been determined using only photons above 0.25 kev ( to avoid position deterioration by ghost images ) to be : ra ( 2000.0 ) = 1420242 , decl .",
    "( 2000.0 ) = + 533411  with an error of @xmath520 .",
    "the spectrum is extremely soft as indicated by the hardness ratio : @xmath6 which is defined as ( h  s)/(h+s ) , with h ( s ) being the counts above ( below ) 0.4 kev over the full pspc range of 0.12.4 kev .",
    "source photons were extracted with a radius of 4 .",
    "the background was chosen at the same ecliptic longitude at @xmath71  distance , corresponding to background photons collected typically 15 sec before or after the time of the source photons .",
    "standard corrections were applied using the dedicated exsas software package ( zimmermann  1994 ) . the spectrum fitted with a blackbody model",
    "is shown in fig .",

    "[ xpar ] summarizes the fit parameters , also including fits with a power law and an accretion disk model .",
    "follow - up pointed rosat observations were performed on july 10/11 , 1995 and again on june 3 , 1997 . in both cases the hri was used . in the 1995 observation",
    "we detect three x - ray photons at the position of , corresponding to a likelihood of 6.2 ( 2.5 @xmath8 ) . because of this marginal significance",

    "we obtained a low - resolution spectrum of this r @xmath7 18.8 mag source using the 3.5 m telescope at calar alto on june 13 , 1993 .",
    "we used the cassegrain spectrograph with a 1024@xmath9640 rca chip ( pixel size 15 @xmath12 m ) . a grating with 240  / mm",
    "was used , allowing the range 40008500    to be observed with a fwhm resolution of 10  .",
    "the spectrum was bias and flat - field corrected and calibrated in wavelength using standard midas reduction packages .",
    "bd + 254655 was used for flux calibration .",
    "the optical spectrum is characterized by strong absorption lines of nai 5175 , mgi 5890  and h@xmath13 ( though it is near the atmospheric a band ) , typical of an elliptical or early spiral type . using the mgi , nai and h@xmath13 line we derive a redshift of @xmath14 .",
    "the balmer absorption lines and the strong drop of the flux beyond the caii h / k break argue against a classification as bl lac object .",
    "no agn - like forbidden emission lines , like [ oiii]@xmath155007 , are detected .    in order to search for optical variability , we embarked on a more extensive photometry programme .",
    "observations were done at three locations , the sonneberg observatory ( germany ) , the special astrophysical observatory ( russia ) and at the wiyn telescope at kitt peak ( usa ) .",

    "this source is readily seen to be extended ( see inset of fig .",
    "moreover , the intensity distribution over the galaxy disk is very flat . since active galaxies typically have a very peaked intensity profile ( dominated by a bright central source ) , this flat distribution argues for a non - active galaxy .",
    "the shape and radial profile suggest an elliptical or early spiral subtype .",
    "size and luminosity arguments then suggest that its distance is about a factor 35 larger than that of source `` a '' .",
    "a lower limit of z@xmath170.07 can be placed by assuming @xmath18 mag , corresponding to the faint end of the galaxy luminosity distribution .",

    "2 ) x - ray afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) may appear as new , bright x - ray sources on the sky .",
    "however , all of the observed afterglows have faded rapidly ( with time@xmath47 ; see greiner 2000 ) .",
    "the rosat all - sky survey data suggests a rather flat light curve over about 3 days , inconsistent with a grb afterglow .",
