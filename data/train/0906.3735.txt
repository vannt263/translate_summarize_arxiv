    "this article has two purposes .",
    "the first one is to present a new implementation of dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) within electronic structure calculation methods .",
    "this implementation is based on a highly precise full - potential linear augmented plane wave method ( flapw ) , as implemented in the wien2k electronic structure code  @xcite .",
    "the second purpose of this article is to report on dmft calculations for the iron oxypnictide lafeaso , the parent compound of the ` @xmath3'-family of recently discovered iron - based superconductors .",
    "the strength of electronic correlations in these materials is an important issue , which has been a subject of debate in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the combination of dynamical mean - field theory with density - functional theory in the local density approximation ( lda+dmft ) provides a powerful framework for the quantitative description of electronic correlations in a realistic setting .",
    "a number of materials have been investigated in this framework over the past decade , such as transition metals and transition - metal oxides , rare - earth and actinide compounds , and organic conductors .",
    "these examples testify to the progress in our understanding of the key physical phenomena associated with the competition between the localized and itinerant characters of electrons belonging to different orbitals ( see e.g. refs .",
    "[ ] for reviews ) .    in the past few years , a new generation of lda+dmft implementations have been put forward  @xcite , which emphasize the use of wannier functions as a natural bridge between the band - structure and the real - space description of the solid in terms of orbitals .",
    "these functions span the subset of orbitals which are treated within the many - body dmft framework . in this article",
    ", we present an implementation of lda+dmft within the full potential linear augmented plane wave ( flapw ) framework , using atomic orbitals that are promoted to wannier functions by a truncated expansion over bloch functions followed by an orthonormalization procedure .",
    "this is a simpler alternative to the previous implementation of dmft within flapw  @xcite , which constructed the wannier functions following the prescription of maximal localisation  @xcite .",
    "the choice of flapw is motivated by the high level of accuracy of this all - electron , full - potential method . in the present work ,",
    "we use the wien2k electronic structure package  @xcite , and we have constructed an interface to it that allows for the construction of wannier - like functions used in dmft . our implementation is described in detail in sec .  [",
    "sect : theory ] . as a benchmark",
    ", we perform calculations on a test material , srvo@xmath4 , which are presented in appendix [ sect : srvo3 ] and compared to previously published results for this material  @xcite . throughout this article , many - body effects are treated in the dmft framework using the recently developed continuous - time strong - coupling quantum monte carlo algorithm of p.werner and coworkers  @xcite . because very low temperatures can be reached , and very high accuracy can be obtained at low - frequency",
    ", this algorithm represents a major computational advance in the field .    in sec .",
    "[ sect : results ] , we address the issue of electronic correlations in lafeaso .",
    "the dmft calculations which have been published soon after the experimental discovery of superconductivity in the iron oxypnictides have provided seemingly contradictory answers to this question . in refs .",
    "[ ] , k.  haule and g.  kotliar proposed that lafeaso is a strongly correlated metal , rather close to the mott metal - insulator transition , and characterized by a reduced value of the quasiparticle coherence scale , resulting in bad metallic behavior .",
    "in contrast , in refs .  [ ] , v.anisimov and coworkers proposed that these materials are in a weak to intermediate regime of correlations .    our lda+dmft calculations for lafeaso support the physical picture of a metal with intermediate correlations .",
    "the average value of the mass renormalization of the fe 3@xmath0 bands is about @xmath1 , in reasonable agreement with the picture inferred from photoemission experiments .",
    "we also find that there is no technical inconsistency between different dmft results reported for lafeaso before .",
    "we show that the discrepancies in the literature are due to two causes : i ) the specific value of the interaction parameters used in these calculations and ii ) the degree of localization of the wannier orbitals chosen to represent the fe 3@xmath0 states , to which many - body terms are applied .    in sec .",
    "[ sect : results ] , we perform detailed comparisons between lda+dmft calculations performed with different degree of localization of the correlated orbitals , associated with different choices of energy windows for the wannier construction ( and accordingly , different degrees of screening of the interaction parameters ) .",
    "we point out several difficulties associated with the use of more extended wannier functions associated with the low - energy iron bands only .",
    "some of these issues have important physical consequences , in particular regarding the sensitivity to the hund s coupling .",
    "this article ends with several appendices , reporting on more detailed aspects or technical issues .",
    "appendix a is devoted to a benchmark of our implementation on a `` classical '' test compound , srvo@xmath4 .",
    "appendix b details some technical issues associated with the projection scheme used to display partial spectral functions with a given orbital character .",
    "appendix c discusses the influence of spin - flip and pair - hopping terms on the degree of correlations , on the basis of model calculations .",
    "we conclude that while these terms are indeed important close to the mott transition , they can safely be neglected in the regime of correlations relevant to lafeaso .",
    "to make this article self - contained and in order to define the main notations , this subsection begins by briefly reviewing some essential aspects of the lda+dmft framework .",
    "the presentation is close to that of refs .",
    "[ ] , where additional details can be found .",
    "dynamical mean - field theory is a quantitative method for handling electron correlations , which can be described as an `` effective atom '' approach .",
    "the self - energy in the solid is approximated by that of a local model , a generalized anderson impurity model describing a specific set of atomic - like orbitals coupled to a self - consistent environment .",
    "the self - consistency requirement is that the local on - site green s function of the solid , calculated using this local self - energy , must coincide with the green s function of the effective impurity model .    in order to formulate the local effective atom problem , a set of ( orthonormal ) local orbitals @xmath5 , and",
    "corresponding wannier - like functions @xmath6 , must be constructed .",
    "these wannier functions span the `` correlated '' subspace @xmath7 of the full hilbert space , in which many - body correlations ( beyond lda ) are taken into account .",
    "this set of orbitals spanning the correlated subspace must be clearly distinguished from the full basis set of the problem , in which the green s function of the solid can be expressed . obviously , the basis set spans a much larger hilbert space , involving all relevant electronic shells .",
    "below , we discuss in details how the @xmath6 are constructed from the local orbitals @xmath5 .",
    "the index @xmath8 is an orbital index within the correlated subset , @xmath9 denotes the atom in the unit cell , and @xmath10 is the spin degree of freedom .",
    "projections of quantities of interest on the subset @xmath7 are done using the projection operator @xmath11    the effective impurity model is then constructed for the correlated subset @xmath7 .",
    "it is defined by the green s function of the effective environment , @xmath12 and hubbard - kanamori interaction parameters @xmath13 . by solving this model in a suitably chosen manner one",
    "obtains the impurity green s function @xmath14 as well as the impurity self - energy @xmath15    for the formulation of the self - consistency condition relating the lattice green s function of the solid to the impurity model , it is convenient to choose the bloch basis @xmath16 as the complete basis set of the problem , since it is a natural output of any electronic structure calculation .",
    "the ( inverse ) green s function of the solid expressed in this basis set is given by : @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the kohn sham eigenvalues and @xmath19 is the approximation to the self - energy obtained by the solution of the dmft impurity problem .",
    "it is obtained by `` upfolding '' the impurity local self - energy as @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the matrix elements of the projection operator , eq .",

    "( [ eq : sigmaimp ] ) , expressed in the local orbitals , and @xmath24 is a double - counting correction , which will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : impl_compmeth ] .",
    "the local green s function is obtained by projecting the lattice green s function to the set of correlated orbitals @xmath8 of the correlated atom @xmath9 and summing over the full brillouin zone , @xmath25 note that the local quantities @xmath26 and @xmath27 carry also an index @xmath9 , which we suppressed for better readability .",
    "the self - consistency condition of dmft imposes that the _ local _ green s function , eq .",
    "( [ eq : local - g ] ) must coincide with the one obtained from the effective impurity problem , @xmath28 this equation implies that the green s function of the effective environment , @xmath29 , must be self - consistently related to the self - energy of the impurity model through : @xmath30 where the dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath32 is specified by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : latt - g],[eq : local - g ] ) . in practice ,",
    "the dmft equations are solved iteratively : starting from an initial @xmath29 , the impurity model is solved for @xmath32 , and a new @xmath29 is constructed from ( [ eq : selfconsist - sigma ] ) .",
    "the cycle is repeated until convergence is reached .    in order to construct the set of wannier functions , we start from a set of local atomic - like orbitals @xmath5 defined in the unit cell .",
    "these orbitals can be expanded over the full bloch basis - set as : @xmath33 , and restricting the sum to those bloch states with kohn - sham energies @xmath34 within @xmath35 .",
    "the number of bands included in @xmath35 will in general depend on @xmath36 and @xmath10 .",
    "we thus define the modified orbitals ( which do not form an orthonormal set because of the truncation ) : @xmath37 the matrix @xmath38 is not unitary , except when the sum in ( [ eq : correl - orb-1 ] ) is carried over all bloch bands .",
    "it is also important to note that the matrices @xmath39 are in general non - square matrices .",
    "they reduce to square matrices only in the case when the number of kohn - sham bands contained in the chosen window equals at every @xmath40-point the number of correlated local orbitals to be constructed .",

    "\\label{eq : wannier - proj}\\ ] ]      in this work , the bloch basis @xmath16 are expanded in augmented plane waves ( apw / lapw ) , which will be briefly described in the following . as was first pointed out by slater @xcite , near atomic nuclei",
    "the crystalline potential in a solid is similar to that of a single atom , while in the region between nuclei ( in the interstitial ) the potential is rather smooth and weakly - varying .",
    "hence , one may introduce a set of basis functions , _ augmented plane waves _ , adapted to this general shape of the potential .",
    "first the crystal space is divided into non - overlapping muffin - tin ( mt ) spheres centered at the atomic sites and the interstitial region in between . in the interstitial region(@xmath48 )",

    "this plane wave is augmented inside each of the mt - spheres by a combination of the radial solutions of the schrdinger equation in such way that the resulting apw is continuous at the sphere boundary .",

    "the energy - independent basis set ( [ eq : lapw ] ) leads to a linear secular problem , however , compared to the energy - dependent apw , a larger number of the lapw in the basis set is generally required to attain the same accuracy . in order to decrease the requirement for the number of apw another linearization scheme , apw+@xmath62 @xcite has been proposed . the apw+@xmath62 basis set consists of the augmented plane waves evaluated at a fixed energy @xmath54 : @xmath63 where the coefficient @xmath58 are determined from the requirement for @xmath49 to be continuous at the sphere boundary . to increase the variational freedom of the apw+@xmath62 basis set the fixed - energy apw ( [ eq : apw ] ) are supplemented for the physically important orbitals ( with @xmath64 ) by the local orbitals ( @xmath62 ) that are not matched to any plane wave in the interstitial and",

    "additional local orbitals ( usually abbreviated with the capital letters as @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) can be introduced to account for semicore states .",
    "they have a similar form as eq .",
    "( [ eq : lo - apw ] ) with the redefined @xmath69 and a second term with a coefficient @xmath70 and the radial function evaluated at a corresponding energy @xmath71 for the semicore band .",
    "the coefficient @xmath59 is set to @xmath72 in the apw+@xmath62 framework .    generally , in the full potential augmented plane wave method the lapw , apw+@xmath62 and @xmath67 types of orbitals can be employed simultaneously .",

( [ eq : local - g ] ) , is done in the irreducible brillouin zone ( bz ) only , supplemented by a symmetrization procedure which is standard in electronic structure calculations , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is any @xmath36-dependent matrix , @xmath96 the number of symmetry operations and @xmath97 the symmetrization matrices .",
    "furthermore , we construct the local orbitals in the local coordinate system of the corresponding atom .",
    "this means that the equivalent atoms in the unit cell for which the dmft should be applied , e.g. the two fe atoms in the oxypnictides , are exactly the same and the impurity problem has to be solved only once .",
    "afterward , the green s function and self - energies are put back to the global coordinate system of the crystal in which the bloch green s function , eq .",
    "( [ eq : latt - g ] ) is formulated .",

    "it allows us to address room temperature ( @xmath98ev@xmath99 ) without problems . in our calculations , we used typically around @xmath100 monte - carlo sweeps and 1000 @xmath36-points in the irreducible bz .",
    "since the ctqmc solver computes the green s function on the imaginary - time axis , an analytic continuation is needed in order to obtain results on the real - frequency axis .",
    "here , we choose to perform a continuation of the impurity self - energy using a stochastic version of the maximum entropy method,@xcite yielding real an imaginary parts of the retarded self - energy @xmath101 which can be inserted into eq .",
    "( [ eq : latt - g ] ) in order to obtain the lattice spectral function and density of states",
    ".      the ctqmc strong - coupling algorithm can deal with the full rotationally invariant form of the interaction hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "however , most calculations presented in this article will consider only the ising terms of the hund s coupling , yielding the interaction hamiltonian : @xmath102 with @xmath103 and @xmath104 the reduced interaction matrices for equal and opposite spins , respectively .",
    "this enables us to take advantage of a maximal amount of conserved quantum numbers and , hence , perform the ctqmc calculation without any truncation of the local basis .",
    "the effects of spin - flip and ` pair - hopping ' terms in the hund s interaction are discussed in appendix  [ sect : hundsrule ] .    in our approach ,",

    "with the above definitions , the coulomb parameters @xmath111 and @xmath114 are related to the matrices via @xmath115    as mentioned above , the lda+dmft scheme ( as the lda+u one ) involves a double - counting correction @xmath24 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : latt - self],[sigma_mm ] ) .",
    "indeed , on - site coulomb interactions are already treated on mean - field level in lda .",
    "several forms of the double - counting correction term have been proposed and investigated.@xcite in this work we follow ref .   and use the following double - counting correction : @xmath116,\\label{eq : dc}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 is the average coulomb interaction , @xmath114 the hund s rule coupling , @xmath117 the spin - resolved occupancy of the correlated orbitals , and @xmath118 .",
    "we compared the results obtained with eq .",
    "( [ eq : dc ] ) also with the double - counting correction given in ref .   which gave very similar results .",
    "the wannier functions defining the correlated subspace of orbitals for which a dmft treatment is performed , are constructed by truncating the expansion of the initial atomic - like local orbitals to a restricted energy window @xmath119 , as described above .",
    "the choice of this energy window is an important issue , which deserves further discussion .",
    "indeed , it will determine the shape and the degree of localization of the resulting wannier - like functions .",
    "let us consider first the case of a rather small energy window , containing only those bands that have dominantly an orbital character which qualifies them as `` correlated '' ( e.g. , the fe-@xmath120 orbitals in lafeaso or the v-@xmath120-t@xmath121 orbitals in srvo@xmath4 ) . in that case ,",
    "the dimension of the kohn - sham hamiltonian used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : latt - g ] ) coincides with that of the correlated subspace @xmath122 ( i.e. with the number of orbitals involved in the effective impurity model , for a single correlated atom per cell ) .",
    "the wannier - like functions are then quite extended in real space , and resemble strongly the wannier orbitals constructed within other schemes , such as the maximally localized wannier construction of ref .  , or the @xmath123-th order muffin - tin basis set downfolded to that set of bands.@xcite in such a situation , hybridization of the correlated orbitals with states that lie outside the energy window is neglected at the dmft level .",
    "some information about the hybridization , e.g. , of the d - states with ligand orbitals is of course taken into account through the leakage of the wannier orbitals on neighboring ligand sites ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "in contrast , if a larger energy window is chosen , it will in general contain states treated as correlated as well as states on which no hubbard interactions are imposed . in this case",
    ", the dimension of the kohn - sham hamiltonian used in the lda+dmft calculation of the local green s function ( [ eq : latt - g],[eq : local - g ] ) exceeds the number of correlated orbitals involved in the effective impurity model .",
    "the wannier functions are more localized in space , and the information about the hybridization of the correlated orbitals with other states within this larger window is carried by the off - diagonal blocks of the hamiltonian between correlated and uncorrelated states .    an instructive case occurs when the correlated bands are well separated from the uncorrelated bands at all @xmath40-points , but the bands overlap in energy .",
    "this situation is realized for instance for the t@xmath121 bands in srvo@xmath4 that extend into the energy region of the e@xmath124 bands . in order to strictly pick the three correlated t@xmath121 bands at each @xmath40-point , one would in that case",
    "have to introduce a @xmath40-dependent energy window . for a @xmath40-independent energy window ,",
    "one will in general have more than three bands at some @xmath40-points , corresponding to some @xmath125 contribution in the chosen window .",
    "this can then be expected to result in slightly more localized orbitals .",
    "an example is given in appendix [ sect : benchmark ] .",
    "the choice of the energy window influences the value of the interaction parameters @xmath13 in a crucial manner , which can be traced back to two main reasons .",
    "first , the interaction parameters are related to matrix elements of a screened interaction between the chosen wannier functions .",
    "the more bands are included in their construction , the more localized they become and , hence , the matrix elements increase .",
    "second , screening effects themselves affect the value of @xmath111 .",
    "the more states are excluded from the screening process , the larger @xmath111 becomes . in what follows",
    "we distinguish carefully between these two effects .    in the present work ,",
    "we apply the present lda+dmft implementation to one of the new high - t@xmath126 superconductors , lafeaso . for constructing the wannier functions , we focus on an energy window that contains the 10 bands around the fermi level with dominantly fe-@xmath120 character and also the bands coming from the @xmath2-bands of o and as , which are mainly located in the energy region @xmath127$]ev , resulting in a `` @xmath128-hamiltonian '' . in addition , we performed calculations also for a smaller energy window containing only the fe-@xmath120 bands , yielding a `` @xmath0-hamiltonian '' , as well as for a very large window including around 60 bloch bands .",
    "the values of the coulomb interactions @xmath111 and @xmath114 are calculated from the constrained random phase approximation ( crpa)@xcite , using the recently developed scheme for entangled band structures@xcite .",
    "crpa calculations for lafeaso have been performed before in refs .  .",
    "in ref .",
    "the screened coulomb parameters are obtained for three different situations : ( i ) by constructing wannier functions from an energy window comprising the fe-@xmath0 bands only , and screening calculated excluding the fe-@xmath0 channels only , ( ii ) by considering a larger window which also includes the as and o-@xmath2 states , so that the screening processes , for instance , from the as-@xmath2 states to the fe-@xmath0 ones are also excluded , ( iii ) and finally , a hybrid situation ( dubbed ` @xmath0-@xmath128 ' in ref .  ) , in which the wannier functions are calculated from an energy window including fe-@xmath0 , o-@xmath2 , and as-@xmath2 , but only the fe-@xmath0 states are excluded from the screening . in other words ,",
    "the screening is calculated as in ( i ) and the wannier functions as in ( ii ) .",
    "as discussed in ref .",
    ", this third option should be appropriate in a situation in which a full @xmath128-hamiltonian is used but hubbard interactions are only applied to the @xmath0 states .    here , we follow the same approach as in the `` @xmath0-@xmath128 '' case of ref .  , but using the new disentanglement scheme of ref .  .",
    "first , a partially screened coulomb interaction @xmath129 is constructed as follows : wannier functions for the fe-@xmath0 states are calculated , and a basis for the complementary subspace ( containing in particular the ligands , but also higher lying f - states ) is constructed .",
    "based on the interpolating @xmath0-band structure , the @xmath130 polarization is computed , and the partially screened coulomb interaction @xmath129 is obtained by screening the bare coulomb interaction by all rpa screening processes _ except @xmath130_. finally , according to the crpa procedure the hubbard @xmath111 matrix is composed of the matrix elements of @xmath129 in the basis of @xmath128-wannier functions . as argued in ref .",
    "this procedure is suitable for calculations that deal with the full @xmath128-hamiltonian in the many - body calculations while explicitly retaining coulomb interactions on the @xmath0-submanifold only .",
    "in particular , we stress that to the extent that our projection method produces wannier functions for the @xmath128-window , the hubbard @xmath111 parameters are expressed in the same basis as the impurity quantities .",
    "it is important to note that we keep the screening channels in crpa , i.e. @xmath130 , unchanged when the energy window in our calculation is varied .",
    "thus , the different energy windows affect only the localization of the wannier functions , but not the screening process of the bare coulomb interaction , and therefore the effective interactions are increasing with increasing energy window . keeping the screening channels fixed",

    "the ground state always corresponds to @xmath197 , and the splitting between the ground state and first excited level is constant .",

    "the observed change of the fe 3@xmath0 atomic ground state , induced by increasing @xmath114 , hints on a possible strong dependence of correlation strength on the hund s rule coupling for lafeaso , which is indeed observed in our lda+dmft calculations with the @xmath0-hamiltonian .",
    "however , this sensitivity stems from a particular choice of delocalized and anisotropic wannier functions and is much less pronounced when the energy window for the wannier function construction is increased .",
    "the bottom - line of this investigation is that all previously published calculations seem to be technically correct .",
    "however , as discussed above , one introduces several severe approximations when dealing with the @xmath0-hamiltonian only , and the justification of these approximations ( restriction to local interactions , single - site dmft , etc ... ) is questionable .",

    "the reason for doing this is of purely technical nature , since in this case one can diagonalize the local problem very efficiently , and furthermore , it enables us to use the so - called segment - picture update scheme,@xcite which increases the efficiency of the ctqmc method a lot .",
    "one may now ask how results change if the fully rotational - invariant hund s rule exchange is taken into account . for this purpose , we study a multiband model hamiltonian , assuming degenerate bands , no interband hybridizations , and a semicircular density of states . applying the self - energy functional theory ( sft),@xcite we can study the quasiparticle renormalization @xmath189 as function of interactions @xmath111 and @xmath114 . in this study , we choose the convention of setting the intraorbital coulomb repulsion to @xmath111 and the interorbital to @xmath237 , and give all energies in units of the single - particle hopping amplitude @xmath238 , i.e. , the band with of the dos is @xmath234 .",
    "in addition to the density - density interactions , we consider also the additional spin - flip and pair - hopping terms of the local hamiltonian , @xmath239 we do calculations at @xmath240 , and choose the reference system for the sft framework to consist of one bath degree of freedom for each correlated orbital .",

    "this is a well known fact that for multi - orbital systems at or close to half - filling , the effect of @xmath114 should be strongest.@xcite the inclusion of spin - flip and pair - hopping terms gives raise to two effects .",
    "( i ) for moderate correlations , @xmath244 , these terms lead to a slight reduction of @xmath189 , but ( ii ) the critical @xmath111 for the mit is shifted upwards .",
    "this qualitatively holds also away from half - filling , which can be seen in the lower panel of fig .",

    "although the transition is not of first order any more , one can again identify two regimes . for moderate correlations , @xmath189 _",
    "decreases _ , whereas close to the transition the spin - flip and pair - hopping terms _ increase _ the renormalization @xmath189 and the critical @xmath243 is pushed to higher values .",
    "this is consistent with a numerical renormalization group study for the 2-orbital hubbard model.@xcite    we also considered the case relevant for pnicitde materials , i.e. , @xmath241 , @xmath245 , and @xmath189 around 0.5 .",
    "this regime could be realize by setting ( i ) @xmath246 and @xmath247 , which shows a reduction of @xmath189 from 0.52 to 0.47 due to spin - flip and pair - hopping , or ( ii ) @xmath248 , @xmath249 , giving a reduction from 0.61 to 0.57 . in conclusion",
