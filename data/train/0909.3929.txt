    "hedlund @xcite proved that the horocyclic flow @xmath2 on the unit tangent bundle of a finite volume hyperbolic surface is minimal , that is all nonperiodic orbits @xmath3 ( called in @xcite `` right - semihorocycles '' , and here positive half - horocycles ) are dense .    on _ geometrically finite surfaces _ ,",
    "i.e. surfaces whose fundamental group is finitely generated , it is known ( see @xcite , @xcite ) that all nonwandering and non periodic orbits of the horocyclic flow are _ dense _ in the sense that the closure of @xmath4 contains the nonwandering set of the geodesic flow . on general hyperbolic surfaces , keeping this definition of `` dense '' horocyclic orbit , we know ( @xcite @xcite @xcite ) how to characterize dense orbits : a horocycle is dense iff it is centered at a horospherical point .",
    "however , as soon as the fundamental group of the surface is of the second kind , i.e. its limit set is strictly included in the boundary at infinity @xmath5 ( see section 2 ) , we can easily find horocycles @xmath6 that are globally dense in the nonwandering set @xmath7 of the geodesic flow ( in the sense that @xmath8 ) , but with one side dense and the other not .    in this note , answering a question of o. sarig",
    ", we characterize these horocycles with one side dense and the other not .",

    "furstenberg s unique ergodicity result @xcite for the horocyclic flow ensures that on the unit tangent bundle @xmath21 of a compact hyperbolic surface , all horocyclic orbits are equidistributed towards the unique @xmath22-invariant measure @xmath23 : for all @xmath9 and @xmath24 continuous , @xmath25 , where @xmath23 is the liouville measure .",

    "in these two articles , equidistribution is obtained for symmetric horocycles",
    "@xmath31 only , and not for one - sided horocycles @xmath32 .",
    "symmetric averages are very natural from a geometric point of view , but not from the ergodic point of view , where a difference of behaviour between the negative and the positive orbit is an interesting phenomenon .    in theorem [ density ]",
    ", we characterized dense horocycles that have one side dense and the other not .",
    "for these horocycles , one can not hope equidistribution of both one - sided orbits . however , according to hopf ergodic theorem , almost all one - sided horocycles should be equidistributed towards @xmath27 .    on geometrically finite hyperbolic surfaces ,",
    "the above phenomenon of dense horocycles with a nondense side is the only obstruction to the equidistribution of one - sided horocycles .",
    "indeed , with methods of @xcite and @xcite , we get :    [ equidistribution ] let @xmath15 be a geometrically finite surface , and @xmath9 such that @xmath0 is dense in the nonwandering set of the geodesic flow .",
    "then @xmath0 is equidistributed towards the unique invariant measure @xmath27 which has full support in the nonwandering set of @xmath2 .    in other words",
    ", for all continuous functions with compact support @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , we have @xmath35    note that periodic orbits are obviously equidistributed to the lebesgue measure on the orbit .",
    "of course , theorem [ equidistribution ] also holds for negative orbits @xmath36 .",
    "most results extend to surfaces of variable negative curvature .",
