    "the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation is one of the most popular approaches to investigate the non - perturbative features of quantum field theory .",
    "the analyses by making use of the sd equation for quark propagator are well - known .",
    "recently , the coupled sd equations for the gluon and ghost propagators in yang - mills theory have been studied mainly in the lorentz ( landau ) gauge.@xcite in this paper , we derive the sd equations for the @xmath0 yang - mills theory in the maximal abelian ( ma ) gauge and solve them analytically in the infrared ( ir ) asymptotic region .",
    "the ma gauge is useful to investigate the yang - mills theory from the view point of the dual superconductivity .    in the ma gauge , in contrast to the ordinary lorentz gauge",
    ", we must explicitly distinguish the diagonal components of the fields from the off - diagonal components .",
    "this is indeed the case even in the perturbative analysis in the uv region.@xcite therefore , we must take account of the four propagators for the diagonal gluon , off - diagonal gluon , diagonal ghost and off - diagonal ghost",
    ". numerical behaviors of gluon propagators in the ma gauge are also investigated on a lattice simulation.@xcite",
    "first , we derive the sd equations from the @xmath0 yang - mills action in the ma gauge@xcite . the graphical representation of sd equations are shown in figure  [ fig : sde ] .",
