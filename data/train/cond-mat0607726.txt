    "actually , the axial nonuniformity is an unavoidable feature of any experimental setup , and , on the other hand , specially designed nonuniformity may be used as an additional tool for the control of dynamics of trapped solitons .",

    "if the transverse potential is much stronger than the longitudinal one , it is natural to reduce the full 3d gp equation , ( [ gpe ] ) , to an effective 1d equation .",
    "different approaches were proposed to achieve this purpose shlyap-@xcite under different conditions . in most cases ,",

    "the cq equation has a family of exact soliton solutions , which are _ stable _ against small perturbations @xcite ( these new solutions were obtained as an analytical continuation of well - known soliton solutions @xcite to the cq equation with the self - defocusing quintic term ) .",

    "the letter is organized as follows . in the next section , using the variational approximation @xcite , we develop a framework for the analysis of the soliton s dynamics in the model with the axially nonuniform trapping , @xmath16 ( the variational approach employs the hamiltonian , rather than lagrangian ) . in section 3 , we derive a final result , _",

    "alternatively , eq . ( [ sigma - max ] ) demonstrates that , for given @xmath3 , physical solutions exist if the transverse confinement is not too strong ( otherwise , over - squeezing of the condensate will lead to the collapse ) : @xmath62if there is a region where @xmath63 exceeds @xmath64 , a moving soliton crossing into this region will blow up due to the collapse .",
    "further analysis of eq . ( [ cubic ] ) demonstrates that there are two solutions for @xmath57 , one decreasing with @xmath13 , and the other one increasing .",
    "the former behavior is natural ( stronger squeeze leads to a smaller transverse size of the condensate ) , while the latter one is not . to all appearance",

    "equation ( [ approx ] ) explicitly shows how the axially nonuniform transverse trapping induces the axial potential ( which depends on the soliton s spin \" ) .",
    "this result may be realized as transformation of a part of the energy of the transverse motion into the axial potential when the confinement frequency gradually varies along @xmath1 .",
    "it is well known that , in the notation adopted here , an effective mass of the soliton , if it is treated as a quasiparticle , is @xmath74 @xcite ( this relation does not depend on @xmath4 ) .",
    "thus , the equation of motion for the soliton in effective potential ( [ approx ] ) , @xmath75 , takes the form@xmath76 .",
    "\\label{dyn}\\]]this equation clearly shows that , in the absence of the explicit potential , @xmath77 , _ stable _ and _ unstable _ equilibria for the soliton are positions where the local trapping frequency attains its _ minimum _ and _ maximum _ , respectively .",
    "as said above , the trapping frequency may also be time - dependent ( in addition to being @xmath1-dependent ) , @xmath78 , then the right - hand side of eq .",

    "as seen from the figure , the transverse width gradually decreases with the increase of @xmath3 , as predicted by eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "the latter effect is a natural manifestation of the self - squeezing of the condensate with attraction between atoms .",
    "results obtained by the substitution of the numerically found @xmath57 in hamiltonian ( [ hsigma ] ) ( with @xmath72 ) , i.e. , the effective potential , are displayed in fig .",
    "it is seen from this figure that both the linear dependence of the potential on @xmath3 for small @xmath3 and deviations from the linear dependence at larger @xmath3 follow the analytical prediction ( approx ) .",
    "in this work , we have demonstrated that a tight transverse trap , whose strength gradually varies in the longitudinal ( axial ) direction , induces an effective longitudinal potential for the soliton in the self - attractive bec . an analytical approximation for this potential , based on the variational method , was developed , under the assumption that the longitudinal size of the soliton is essentially smaller than the scale of the trap s nonuniformity .",
    "a fully explicit result was obtained for the case of weak nonlinearity .",
    "the potential depends on the soliton s intrinsic vorticity ( if any ) , and its norm ( the number of atoms trapped in the soliton ) .",
    "the analytical results reported in this letter can be used to analyze inevitable effects of the nonuniformity of the transverse trapping in experimental situations , as well as to devise axially nonuniform traps with the purpose to control the longitudinal dynamics of the solitons .",
    "systematic numerical simulations of the full 3d model , aimed at direct verification of the analytical predictions , demand special effort and will be reported elsewhere .",
