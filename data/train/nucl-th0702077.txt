    "since the suggestion of @xmath0 suppression as a signal for the formation of the quark - gluon plasma in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite , understanding the interactions of the @xmath0 with other hadrons has been an important issue as @xmath0 dissociation by hadrons could also cause the suppression of the produced @xmath0 @xcite . because the @xmath0-hadron interactions can not be directly accessed by present experiments ,",
    "the @xmath0-hadron cross sections have been estimated through several assumptions and/or model calculations .",
    "empirically , the @xmath0-nucleon cross sections have been estimated by using the data for @xmath0 photoproduction from the nucleon @xcite , @xmath0 photoproduction from nuclei , and @xmath0 production from the nucleon - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "since those data are scattered over a wide range of energy and the estimation is model - dependent , the estimated values for the @xmath0-nucleon cross sections range from @xmath4 mb to @xmath5 mb .",

    "theoretically , these cross sections have been estimated in various ways including the perturbative qcd @xcite , qcd sum - rule approach @xcite , meson - exchange models @xcite , regge theory approach @xcite , quark models @xcite , lattice qcd @xcite , and other methods @xcite . despite of the efforts to resolve the model - dependence of the cross sections ,",
    "the uncertainties in theoretical / model calculations for the @xmath0-hadron cross sections are not yet clarified and the predicted cross sections are model - dependent not only in the magnitude but also in the energy dependence .",
    "recently , the @xmath0-nucleon dissociation cross sections have been calculated in a quark - interchange model by hilbert _",
    "@xcite , and the results show a large difference from the meson - exchange model predictions of ref .  @xcite . in particular , the two models predict very different values for the ratio of the cross sections , depends on the energy . here , we compare the peak values of the two cross sections . ]",
    "@xmath6 , namely , @xmath7 in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas @xmath8 in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper , in order to understand this discrepancy , we re - examine and improve the meson - exchange model of ref .  @xcite by using vector - meson dominance and charm vector - current conservation to constrain the coupling constants and form factors of this model .",
    "we will show that these constraints can lead to @xmath9 in the meson - exchange model .",
    "we will also discuss the role driven by the tensor coupling terms of the interactions of vector mesons .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the coupling constants of the relevant effective lagrangians for the @xmath0-nucleon absorption processes .",
    "the @xmath0 coupling constants are discussed in connection with vector - meson dominance , which leads to the universality of the @xmath0 coupling .",
    "the role of the conserved charm vector - current in determining coupling constants and in constraining form factors are also explained .",
    "section  iii contains the numerical results , and the dependence of the cross sections on the coupling constants and form factors are explored .",
    "we summarize in sec .  iv .",
    "the diagrams which contribute to the @xmath0-nucleon dissociation reactions are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : diag ] . to evaluate these diagrams , we use the following effective lagrangians : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the @xmath0 vector - meson field and @xmath12 is the iso - doublet @xmath12 meson field , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the iso - doublet @xmath15 vector - meson field is defined in the similar way . in order to determine the coupling constants , several methods",
    "have been suggested and these include quark models using the heavy quark effective theory approach @xcite , qcd sum rules @xcite , and the su(4 ) symmetry . in this section , we discuss the coupling constants in the effective lagrangians in some detail .      for the @xmath0 couplings we use vector - meson dominance ( vmd ) as in refs .",
    "@xcite . in vmd , the photon couples to a hadron through intermediate vector mesons so that @xmath16 where the sum runs over vector meson states @xmath17 and the current - field identity gives @xmath18 with the vector meson polarization vector @xmath19 .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 can be obtained from @xmath21 .",
    "the most recent compilation of the data gives @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 so that @xmath26 , while the su(4 ) symmetry gives @xmath27 .",
    "this evidently shows the aspect of the badly broken flavor su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "application to the @xmath28 meson makes the symmetry relation worse as we have @xmath29 from the data , while the su(5 ) symmetry implies @xmath30 . for the intermediate state , we consider @xmath31 by expecting either that the higher vector meson contributions are suppressed or that there is a strong cancellation among them , especially in the charm sector @xcite . applying vmd to the @xmath12-meson iso - doublet @xmath32",
    ", we then have the following relations among the coupled equations @xcite : @xmath33 which can be solved by using the su(2 ) symmetry relations , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath36 this means that the photon sees the charm quark charge through the intermediate @xmath0 vector - meson . , which gives @xmath37 .",
    "this should be compared with @xmath38 determined from the experimental data for @xmath39 . ] by applying to the @xmath15 iso - doublet , we get the relation , @xmath40 . in the qcd sum - rule calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite , this relation holds within @xmath41% .    for the @xmath42 coupling",
    ", we use the relation of the heavy quark mass limit @xcite , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the ( average ) mass scale of the @xmath12/@xmath15 mesons .",
    "this leads to the coupling constants @xmath45    the coupling constant @xmath46 can also be estimated through vmd . as we have seen before , the photon sees the charm quark charge through the @xmath0 .",
    "if we apply this to @xmath47 , then we have @xmath48 that is , the universality of the @xmath0 coupling .",
    "this is also closely related to the charm vector - current conservation as will be shown below . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath46 was estimated from the su(4 ) relation assuming that the @xmath0 belongs to the * 15 * -multiplet , which gives @xmath49 .",
    "but , with this assumption , the @xmath0 contains significant light quark components and , as a result , @xmath46 is underestimated by a factor of @xmath50 compared with our estimate .",
    "the tensor coupling constant @xmath51 can also be estimated by using vmd with the anomalous magnetic moment of @xmath52 .",
    "the magnetic moment of @xmath52 has not been measured , but the quark model predicts @xmath53 @xcite , and this gives a predicted anomalous magnetic moment @xmath54 for @xmath52 . since the light @xmath55 , @xmath56 quarks form a spin-@xmath57 state in @xmath52 , the @xmath52 magnetic moment is solely determined by the charm quark . therefore",
    ", vmd gives @xmath58 which leads to @xmath59 .      in flavor su(4 ) , mesons are in a * 15 * -multiplet and baryons are in a * 20 * -multiplet , which correspond to the meson octet and baryon octet of su(3 ) , respectively . since @xmath60 ,",
    "there are two couplings for the meson - baryon - baryon interactions as in the case of su(3 ) , and they can be related to the su(3 ) coupling constants @xmath12 and @xmath61 .",
    "this gives the su(4 ) symmetry relations , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , of ref .",
    "the empirical values of ref .",
    "@xcite for strange hadrons then give @xmath64 these values are quite different from the qcd sum - rule predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath65 this difference can affect the value of the ratio @xmath66 as will be discussed below .    for the tensor coupling constant @xmath67",
    ", there is no theoretical prediction for its value .",
    "if we assume the su(4 ) relation again , we have @xcite @xmath68 however , it should be mentioned that the su(4 ) symmetry breaking effects can significantly alter the values of the coupling constants given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nij ] ) and ( [ eq : nij2 ] ) . therefore , in this work , we investigate the role of the @xmath69 and @xmath70 interactions by varying their coupling constants .",
    "the non - vanishing tensor coupling for the @xmath70 interaction also causes the four - point interaction that is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag](c ) . this term can be obtained by gauging the tensor interaction and it reads @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the gauge coupling constant .",
    "as we shall see below , @xmath72 can be related to the universal @xmath0 coupling constant by charm vector - current conservation .",
    "the production amplitudes can be written as @xmath73 with @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the @xmath76-channel amplitude , @xmath77 is the @xmath55-channel amplitude , @xmath78 is the @xmath76-channel amplitude including the anomalous @xmath79 interaction , and @xmath80 is from the contact term . the amplitudes can be obtained straightforwardly from the interaction lagrangians , e.g. , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and will not be given here .",
    "now we impose the conservation condition of the charm vector - current to the production amplitudes , i.e. , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the four - momentum of the @xmath0 .",
    "the anomalous terms and the @xmath51 terms already satisfy this condition separately , and we have @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the four - momentum of the produced @xmath15 meson . thus , vector - current conservation leads to @xmath86 therefore , one can verify that the charm vector - current conservation leads to the vmd relation ( [ eq : vdm - rel ] ) for the coupling constants and fixes the gauge coupling constant @xmath72 .",
    "because of the finite size of hadrons , it is required to include form factors in effective lagrangian approaches , which are functions of the momentum of exchanged ( or off - shell ) particles .",
    "the form factors may be calculated from more microscopic theories @xcite , but here we employ a simple phenomenological form @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the four - momentum and mass of the exchanged particle , respectively . therefore ,",
    "when the exchanged particle is on its mass - shell , it has the correct normalization @xmath90 and , as @xmath91 , @xmath92 becomes a gaussian of @xmath93 with a width of @xmath94 . in this work",
    ", we take the limit @xmath91 .    however , employing such form factors violates the current conservation condition .",
    "there is no unique way to restore current conservation with form factors and in this work we follow the prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite , namely , current conservation is recovered by introducing the contact diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : diag](c ) , which is , in practical calculation , equivalent to replace the form factors by a universal one in the form of @xmath95[1-f(u ) ] .",
    "\\label{eq : cff}\\ ] ] this form factor is also employed for @xmath96 production in the presence of the @xmath70 tensor interaction .",
    "we first discuss our results without the tensor coupling terms , i.e. , by setting @xmath97 for a comparison with the results of ref .  @xcite . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xs ] are our results on the total cross sections for @xmath98 obtained with the couplings of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nij ] ) .",
    "the results depend on the cutoff @xmath99 , and @xmath100 gev is used for this calculation .",
    "the dependence of our results on @xmath99 will be discussed later .",
    "the dashed , dotted , and dot - dashed lines are the contributions from the @xmath76-channel , @xmath55-channel , and anomalous terms , respectively , and the solid lines are their sums .",
    "there are several comments in comparing with the results of ref .",
    "we first verify the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite that the anomalous interaction terms give small contributions in both reactions .",
    "however , there are several crucial differences .",
    "since the vmd and current conservation condition require much larger @xmath46 coupling constant , this enhances the contribution from the @xmath55-channel diagram in both reactions . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath101 reaction is dominated by the @xmath55-channel diagram , and the @xmath102 has comparable contributions from both the @xmath76- and @xmath55-channel diagrams .",
    "furthermore , this makes the cross section ratio @xmath66 to be larger than @xmath103 , which is opposite to the result of ref .",
    "in addition , our predictions on the energy dependence of the cross sections show more rapid decrease of the cross sections at larger energies than that of ref .  @xcite .",
    "although this is partly due to the gaussian form factor adopted in this model , it is the current conserved form of the form factors ( [ eq : cff ] ) that is mainly responsible for this energy dependence of the cross sections . taking into account all these effects",
    ", we found that @xmath104 with our parameters , and the peak value of the cross sections for @xmath105 final state reaction is close to @xmath106 mb .",
    "we also found that the tensor interactions , @xmath51 term and @xmath67 term , can give nontrivial contributions to the cross sections but play a different role . to see the role of these terms , we first present the results with @xmath107 but with @xmath108 in fig .",
    "[ fig : xs - psi ] , while keeping the other parameters as in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : xs ] . in this case , the @xmath55-channel contributions are further enhanced .",
    "furthermore , because of the large contributions from the @xmath51 term , the @xmath76-channel and @xmath55-channel diagrams interfere constructively in @xmath109 production and destructively in @xmath96 production , which is opposite to the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : xs ] .",
    "consequently , the @xmath110 cross sections are enhanced , but the @xmath111 cross sections are not changed so much .",
    "this leads to the increase of the cross section ratio and we have @xmath112 , which is close to the prediction of the quark - interchange model of ref .",
    "@xcite .    to verify the role of the @xmath67 tensor term",
    ", we use the value of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nij2 ] ) since there is no theoretical prediction for this coupling constant .",
    "other parameters are the same as in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : xs - psi ] and the results are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : xs - dstar ] .",
    "this shows that the effect of the @xmath67 term in @xmath113 is negligible , which is expected since it contributes to the suppressed @xmath76-channel anomalous term only .",
    "however , this tensor interaction can change noticeably the cross sections for the @xmath114 reaction .",
    "this is because the tensor term enters both in the @xmath76-channel and in the @xmath55-channel diagrams .",
    "furthermore , this term requires the presence of the contact term . as a result",
    ", the @xmath67 term enhances the @xmath96 production cross sections and leads to a smaller value of the ratio @xmath66 , and @xmath115 is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : xs - dstar ] .",
    "the cross sections and their ratio @xmath66 depend on the coupling constants @xmath116 and @xmath117 which are not well understood yet . in order to see this dependence , we use the coupling constants ( [ eq : qcdsr ] ) predicted by the qcd sum - rule calculation of ref .  @xcite .",
    "this gives very different values of the cross section ratio , and instead of @xmath118 and @xmath119 , ( figs .",
    "[ fig : xs - psi ] and [ fig : xs - dstar ] ) we have @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively .",
    "this also changes the corresponding maximum values of the @xmath122 cross sections and they are @xmath123 mb and @xmath124 mb for the two cases , respectively , as shown in table  [ tab1 ] .    as was mentioned before",
    ", the cross sections also depend on the cutoff parameter @xmath99 , and we have used @xmath125 gev . in order to see the dependence of our results on the form factor , we repeat the calculation for three different values of the cutoff , i.e. , @xmath126 gev , @xmath127 gev , and @xmath128 gev . shown in table  [ tab1 ] are the peak values of the @xmath129 cross sections and the ratio @xmath66 .",
    "we found that the cross sections for the @xmath130 reaction are more sensitive to the cutoff than those for the @xmath131 reaction .",
    "thus the ratio @xmath66 decreases as the cutoff parameter @xmath99 increases .",
    "however , we found that the @xmath67 term suppresses @xmath66 regardless of the cutoff parameter value .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this work , we have reanalyzed and improved the meson - exchange model for @xmath0-nucleon reaction of ref .",
    "@xcite . we found that vector - meson dominance and charm vector - current conservation lead to the universality of the @xmath0 meson couplings , which can drastically change the ratio @xmath66 of the cross sections of @xmath2 and @xmath132 .",
    "it is also found that this ratio is sensitive to the relative strengths of @xmath116 and @xmath117 as well as to the tensor coupling terms in the @xmath133 and @xmath70 interactions .",
    "we found that the vmd and vector - current conservation lead to a large value of @xmath66 .",
    "this value can be further enhanced by the @xmath133 tensor interaction .",
    "but the @xmath70 tensor interaction has the opposite role by decreasing @xmath66 .    to match the quark - interchange model predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite with those from our effective lagrangian approach leads us to conclude that @xmath116 must be larger than @xmath117 and @xmath134 must be small .",
    "the first condition contradicts with the qcd sum - rule predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite that prefers a similar strength for the two couplings . instead",
    ", the su(4 ) symmetry relations satisfy this condition .",
    "however , su(4 ) symmetry gives a large value for @xmath134 , and thus does not fulfill the second condition . since su(4 )",
    "symmetry must be broken by the heavy charm quark mass , it would be interesting to see how badly the su(4 ) symmetry relations for @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath67 are broken .",
    "therefore , more rigorous studies on these couplings are required , which will eventually help to reconcile the predictions of the quark - interchange model and of the meson - exchange model .",
    "nevertheless , the constraints used in this work , vmd and charm vector - current conservation , are found to have a nontrivial role to fill the gap between the quark - interchange model and meson - exchange model predictions to some extent .",
