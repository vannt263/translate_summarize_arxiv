    "magnetic filaments are spontaneously generated by the growth of the weibel , or filamentation , instability .",
    "this instability is triggered when two relativistic plasma shells cross each other @xcite .",
    "it has been invoked for intergalactic magnetic fields generation @xcite , inertial confinement fusion @xcite , or collisionless shocks physics @xcite .",
    "regarding collisionless shocks , it has been known for long that they are capable of accelerating particles @xcite ( for a particle to receive energy , and keep it , the medium has to be collisionless ) .",
    "as such , it is believed that they may play a key - role in the generation of high energy cosmic rays , or gamma ray bursts @xcite .    during the last decade or so",
    ", the physics of collisionless shocks has undergone a renewed interest , as it became possible to study them in detail through large - scale particle - in - cell simulations @xcite .",
    "on the theory side , one of the problems currently being solved has to do with the very formation of such shocks . concerning fluid shocks , it is known they can arise from the steepening of a large amplitude sound wave , or from the collision of two media , with a collision speed faster than the speed of sound in one of them @xcite .",
    "the formation process in the collisionless case is more involved because such shocks occur in collionless plasmas . in these kind of settings , where the collision frequency is virtually zero , a shock has to be mediated by collective plasma interactions @xcite .    as electromagnetic objects , collisionless shocks display far more variety than fluid shocks .",
    "they can be electrostatic or electromagnetic ( weibel ) @xcite , form in pair or electron / ion plasmas @xcite , and on the top of these dichotomies , be influenced by the strength of an external magnetic field and its orientation @xcite .    among the different kinds of collisionless shocks , an interesting sub - class is formed by the so - called `` weibel shocks '' .",
    "when two collisionless plasma shells run into each other , the overlapping region turns unstable .",
    "if the encounter occurs at relativistic velocity , the dominant instability is the weibel one @xcite .",
    "this instability grows magnetic filaments which can block the incoming flow , initiating the shock formation @xcite .",
    "note that at the very beginning of the shock formation process , the counter - streaming plasmas cross each other , triggering the weibel instability . at this stage ,",
    "magnetic filaments are under formation , and particles are not stopped .",
    "then , the weibel instability reaches saturation , the filaments are fully formed , and may stop the particles arriving at later times .",
    "the flow stopped by the filaments is not the flow that formed them .",
    "it is clear that in shock setting , once the filaments have stopped a number of particles , these may perturb the filaments and break them .",
    "yet , it has been found that the resulting field configuration is at least as efficient as were the filaments to stop the flow @xcite . in order to know whether a shock will start forming after the saturation of the weibel instability , or not",
    ", the key question is therefore : at saturation time , are the filaments able to block the incoming particles ?    for the case",
    "where there is no external magnetic field , the conditions upon which the flow is blocked can been derived from the analysis of the motion of charged particles in the weibel magnetic filaments @xcite . yet , many astrophysical settings are magnetized .",
    "if two plasma shells interact over an external , flow - aligned , magnetic field @xmath3 , the weibel instability still grows while the field is not too strong @xcite . here",
    ", the resulting magnetic filaments supposed to block the incoming flow for the shock to form , will be superimposed over the external @xmath3 .",
    "the goal of this article is therefore to study this problem : how about the trajectory of charged particles within magnetic filaments and an external @xmath3 ?",
    "we therefore consider the setup pictured on figure [ setup ] .",
    "the half space @xmath4 is filled with the magnetic filaments @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is therefore the coherence length of the magnetic field .",
    "a static , homogenous , external magnetic field @xmath7 fills the entire space . a particle with charge @xmath8 , mass @xmath9 , velocity @xmath10 and lorentz factor @xmath11 ,",
    "is launched at @xmath12 from @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "note that such a heaviside modelling already represents a significant simplification of the interface @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic structures that have been identified within the finite width interface @xcite can not be accounted for in the present work .",
    "however , previous analysis of the shock formation process have shown that the particles are indeed stopped within the weibel filaments @xcite",

    "the interface at @xmath28 is the location of important magnetic turbulence . as a consequence",
    ", particles starting from the shaded area do not systematically bounce back to @xmath24 , but tend to be trapped instead , in the region @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , particles starting out of the shading area stream through the magnetic filaments .",
    "our goal from now - on is to find out how figure [ zero ] evolves when the external magnetic field @xmath3 is switched on , that is , when @xmath29 .",
    "although the full resolution of the problem will be numerical , a number of analytical considerations can pave the way to such resolution .",
    "to start with , the system ( [ eq : dimless ] ) is invariant by the substitutions @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "it means an opposite @xmath3 will simply have the particles spin in the opposite direction .",
    "but the @xmath32 component , which determines whether the particle bounces back or not , is left unchanged .",
    "we can therefore restrict our study to @xmath33 , that is , @xmath34 .",
    "also , we can integrate the third equation of the system ( [ eq : dimless ] ) , and obtain regardless of @xmath35 , @xmath36 since the velocity is constant , equal to @xmath37 , the left - hand - side remains negative along the trajectory . as a consequence , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , trajectories are bounded within intervals of width @xmath40 and one can restrict the study to @xmath41 $ ] @xcite .",
    "finally , the system ( [ eq : dimless ] ) is also invariant when substituting @xmath31 and @xmath42 .",
    "this implies that we can restrict our attention to the interval @xmath43 $ ] .      the second equation of the system ( [ eq : dimless ] )",
    "can be integrated , giving , @xmath46 inserting this result in the first equation of the system , and expressing @xmath47 in terms of @xmath44 with eq .",
    "( [ eq : bounded ] ) , we obtain the following equation for @xmath44 only , @xmath48 while it can not be solved exactly , an approximated resolution is possible when @xmath49",

    "but the first one , namely @xmath66 , tends to @xmath67 depending on the sign of the parameter @xmath68 .",
    "we can indeed write , @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , our particle returns to @xmath65 if @xmath70 , that is , @xmath71 this expression bears interesting consequences .",
    "in the absence of external magnetic field , that is , @xmath23 , the equation above gives @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "as can be seen on figure [ zero ] , the frontier between particles with @xmath73 goes all the way down to @xmath74 .",

    "the forthcoming numerical study will confirm the conclusions of these two subsections , as evidenced on figures [ alpha ] .",
    "we here check that the constancy of 2 canonical momenta and of the hamiltonian does not bring new information capable of pushing further our analytical exploration .",

    "the canonical momentum @xmath114 therefore only depends on the time derivative of the coordinates , and on the @xmath115 coordinate .",
