    "in this note , all graphs are finite , simple and undirected .",
    "the complete graph on @xmath1 vertices is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the number of graph vertices in the largest complete subgraph of @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath3 is called the clique number of @xmath0 .",
    "the girth of a graph is the number of edges in its shortest cycle .",
    "a proper ( vertex ) coloring is an assignment of labels or colors to each vertex of a graph so that no edge connects two identically colored vertices .",
    "the smallest number of colors needed for the proper coloring of a graph @xmath0 is the chromatic number , @xmath4 . for a given graph @xmath5 , a graph @xmath0",
    "is called @xmath5-free if no induced subgraph of @xmath0 is isomorphic to @xmath5 . in particular , a @xmath6-free graph is called a triangle - free graph .    it is obvious that @xmath7 .",
    "the chromatic and clique numbers of a graph can be arbitrarily far apart .",
    "there are various constructions of triangle - free graphs with arbitrarily large chromatic number .",
    "probably the best known is due to mycielski  @xcite . in 1955",
    ", he created a construction that preserves the property of being triangle - free but increases the chromatic number . for more references , see also blanche descartes  @xcite , john kelly and leroy kelly  @xcite , and alexander zykov  @xcite .",
    "erds  @xcite with a deeper insight showed the existence of graphs that have high girths and still have arbitrarily large chromatic number by probabilistic means . indeed , exploring the relation between clique number and other properties of graphs such as chromatic number , maximum degree , etc . , is still an active and fascinating research area within mathematics .",
    "there are still a lot of open questions waiting to be solved in this area , such as bounding the chromatic number of triangle - free graphs with fixed maximum degree  @xcite , or more generally reed s conjecture  @xcite . for more problems",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the insights gained from this literature review indicate that we need a deeper understanding of these spaces .",
    "thus , it is of interest to know new ways of constructing such spaces .    in  @xcite , compatibility graphs and @xmath0-tucker lemma",
    "were introduced to obtain a new topological lower bound on the chromatic number of a special family of graphs .",
    "indeed , via the bound , a new method for finding test graphs was proposed by the author . in this note , we give a new way , based on compatibility graphs and @xmath0-tucker lemma , for constructing graphs with high chromatic number and small clique . finally , as a corollary of this method",
    ", we give a new proof of the famous kneser s conjecture .",
    "the organization of the note is as follows . in section @xmath8",
    ", we set up notation and terminology , and we repeat the relevant material from  @xcite that will be needed throughout the note .",
    "finally , in section @xmath9 , our main results are stated and proved .",
    "in this section we review definitions and results as required for the rest of the note . here and subsequently , @xmath0 stands for a non - trivial finite group , and its identity element is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "a partially ordered set or poset is a set and a binary relation @xmath11 such that for all @xmath12 : @xmath13 ( reflexivity ) ; @xmath14 and @xmath15 implies @xmath16 ( transitivity ) ; and @xmath14 and @xmath17 implies @xmath18 ( anti - symmetry ) .",
    "a pair of elements @xmath19 of a partially order set are called comparable if @xmath14 or @xmath17 .",
    "a subset of a poset in which each two elements are comparable is called a chain .",
    "a function @xmath20 between partially ordered sets is order - preserving or monotone , if for all @xmath21 and @xmath22 in @xmath23 , @xmath24 implies @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath26 is a set , then a group action of @xmath0 on @xmath26 is a function @xmath27 denoted @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 and @xmath30 for all @xmath31 in @xmath0 and all @xmath32 in @xmath26 .",
    "a @xmath0-poset is a poset together with a @xmath0-action on its elements that preserves the partial order , i.e , if @xmath33 then @xmath34 .    to provide topological lower bounds on the chromatic numbers of graphs ,",
    "hom complex was defined by lovsz .",
    "for a recent account of the theory , we refer the reader to  @xcite .",
    "we need the following version of this concept .",
    "let @xmath35 be a graph with vertex set @xmath36 .",
    "for a graph @xmath5 , we define hom poset @xmath37 whose elements are given by all @xmath1-tuples @xmath38 of non - empty subsets of @xmath39 , such that for any edge @xmath40 of @xmath35 we have @xmath41 .",
    "the partial order is defined by @xmath42 if and only if @xmath43 for all @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath45 be the cyclic group of order @xmath46.the cyclic group @xmath47 acts on the poset @xmath48 naturally by cyclic shift .",
    "more precisely , for each @xmath49 and @xmath50 , define @xmath51 .    to find a new bound on the chromatic number of a special family of graphs , a combinatorial analog of the borsuk - ulam theorem for @xmath0-spaces , @xmath0-tucker lemma ,",
    "wsa introduced in  @xcite . to recall the lemma",
    ", we need to make some definitions .",
    "consider the @xmath0-poset @xmath52 with natural @xmath0-action , @xmath53 , and the order defined by @xmath54 if @xmath55 . also , let @xmath56 be the @xmath0-poset whose action is @xmath57 , and the order relation is given by : @xmath58    suppose that @xmath1 is a positive integers , @xmath0 is a finite group , and @xmath59 is a map such that @xmath60 for all @xmath61 and all @xmath32 in @xmath62 .",
    "then there exist two sets @xmath63 and @xmath64 such that @xmath65 . throughout this note",
    ", such a pair is called the bad pair .",
    "it is worth noting that , there is a more general result for the case @xmath66 , the cyclic group of prime order @xmath67 , see the @xmath68-tucker lemma of ziegler  @xcite .",
    "let us finish this section by recalling the definition of compatibility graph from  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath23 be a @xmath0-poset .",
    "the compatibility graph of @xmath23 , denoted by @xmath69 , has @xmath23 as vertex set , and two elements @xmath70 are adjacent if there is an element @xmath71 such that @xmath32 and @xmath72 are comparable in @xmath23 .",
    "in this section we state and discuss the main results of this note .    for every graph @xmath5 and @xmath73 ,",
    "the graph @xmath74 is @xmath75-free .    for an @xmath46-tuple @xmath76 ,",
    "define @xmath77 .",
    "suppose that vertices @xmath78 form a clique of size @xmath79 in @xmath74 .",
    "without loss of generality assume that @xmath80 for each @xmath81 .",
    "now , by the definition , there are @xmath82 such that @xmath83 , for each @xmath84 .",
    "we claim that @xmath85 for each @xmath86 .",
    "suppose , contrary to our claim , that @xmath87 for some @xmath88 .",
    "since @xmath89 is connected to @xmath90 there is a , @xmath91 such that @xmath92 is comparable to @xmath90 . without loss of generality assume that @xmath93 .",
    "therefore @xmath94 which contradicts the fact that any two distinct entries of @xmath95 are disjoint ( note that , since @xmath91 , @xmath96 which demonstrates that @xmath97 and @xmath98 are two distinct entries of @xmath95 ) , therefore @xmath99 .",
    "now , the proof is completed .",
    "if @xmath100 is a graph homomorphism , we associate it to a new map @xmath101 by sending each @xmath102 to @xmath103 . since a complete bipartite subgraph of @xmath5 is sent by @xmath104 to a complete bipartite subgraph of @xmath105 , the map @xmath106 is a graph homomorphism .",
    "moreover , the construction commutes with the composition of maps and the identity homomorphism is mapped to the identity homomorphism .",
    "so , using the terminology of category theory , one can say that @xmath106 is a functor from the category of graphs to the category of @xmath75-free graphs .",
    "furthermore , we have an obvious graph homomorphism from @xmath107 to @xmath5 by sending each vertex @xmath102 to @xmath108",
    ". this give us the following lower bound on chromatic number .",
    "for any graph @xmath5 , @xmath109 .",
    "recalling that the kneser graph @xmath110 is the graph whose vertices correspond to the @xmath79-element subsets of the set @xmath111 , and two vertices are adjacent if and only if the two corresponding sets are disjoint .",
    "these graphs were introduced by lovsz  @xcite in his famous proof of the kneser s conjecture  @xcite . in the context of graph theory ,",
    "kneser s conjecture is @xmath112 , whenever @xmath113 . beside the lovsz s proof , there exist several different proofs for kneser s conjecture , see for instance @xcite .",
    "now we are in a position to state and prove our main theorem .    for all integers @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",
    "for any @xmath116 and each @xmath117 , define @xmath118 .",
    "also , denote by @xmath119 the @xmath46-tuple @xmath120 where @xmath89 is the set of all @xmath79-subsets of @xmath121 .",
    "now , assume that @xmath122 is a proper coloring of @xmath123 with @xmath124 colors .",
    "we define a @xmath125 coloring .",
    "let @xmath126 . if @xmath127 for all @xmath117 , set @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the first nonzero element in @xmath26 . if @xmath130 and @xmath131 for some @xmath132 , set @xmath133 where @xmath129 is the first nonzero element in @xmath26 such that @xmath134 .",
    "finally , consider the case that all of @xmath130 .",
    "let @xmath135 be the one of @xmath136 , with @xmath137 .",
    "now , set @xmath138    note that , the vertices @xmath139 form a clique of size @xmath46 in @xmath123 , @xmath140 .",
    "thus , @xmath141 takes its values in @xmath142 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath143 for all @xmath144 and all @xmath145 .",
    "so , to use @xmath47-tucker lemma , its enough to show that @xmath141 can not have a bad pair .",
    "let @xmath63 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "we consider three cases .",
    "* the first case is @xmath148 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath149 for all @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "these imply that @xmath152 .",
    "thus , @xmath153 . *",
    "the second case is @xmath154 . in this case , the number of @xmath150 for which @xmath130 is equal to the number of @xmath150 for which @xmath155 .",
    "this fact beside the fact that @xmath156 for all @xmath150 , imply that @xmath130 if and only if @xmath155 .",
    "therefore , @xmath153 . *",
    "finally , assume that @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "on the one hand , by the definition of @xmath141 , @xmath159 . on the other hand , since @xmath63 and @xmath158 , the vertex @xmath160 is connected to the vertex @xmath161 which contradicts the proper coloring of @xmath162 .    applying @xmath47-tucker s lemma we have @xmath163 , thus @xmath164 .",
    "in fact , the existence of graphs with high chromatic number and small clique is a direct consequence of theorem @xmath165 and theorem @xmath166 . as another application",
    ", one could deduce a new proof of kneser s conjecture .",
    "more precisely , it is well - known that the kneser graph @xmath110 has a coloring with @xmath167 colors ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section3.3 ) ) , thus by theorem @xmath166 and corollary @xmath165 we have @xmath168 in summary we have the following corollary .    for all @xmath169 and @xmath113 , the chromatic number of @xmath170 is @xmath167 . in particular , @xmath171 .",
