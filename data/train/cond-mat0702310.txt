    "starting from the work of deutsch @xcite , it has been known for some time now , that inertial particles in a random velocity field undergo clustering phenomena .",
    "these behaviors are observed in numerical simulation of turbulence as well ( see e.g @xcite and references therein ) and are thought to give an important contribution to coalescence phenomena , e.g. in the process of rain formation @xcite .",
    "both in the case of random fields and of real turbulence , spatial inhomogeneity of the statistics , though contributing to particle segregation @xcite , does not appear to be an essential factor .",
    "random velocity fields with various statistical properties , have been used to model inertial particles in turbulent flows , both in the presence of gravity @xcite and in its absence @xcite .",
    "simplified models disregarding in part or in total the spatial structure of the velocity field have been introduced as well ( see e.g. @xcite ) , to cope with the difficulty of the analytical treatment of the multi - particle statistics .    in the simplest instance , an inertial particle in a turbulent flow is characterized by the relaxation time of its velocity relative to the fluid : the stokes time @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the particle radius , @xmath2 is the ratio of the particle to fluid density ( assumed large ) and @xmath3 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid @xcite . experimental data @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite both indicate that clustering is stronger for particles with @xmath4 of the order of the kolmogorov time scale .",
    "this observation , and the fact that stokes times for most atmospheric aerosols of interest lie in this range @xcite have motivated substantial analytical effort in the small stokes time regime , with smooth velocity fields mimicking turbulence at the kolmogorov scale @xcite .    some analysis has been carried on also for stokes times in the turbulent inertial range @xcite , but numerical simulations @xcite indicate that concentration fluctuations do not follow simple scaling rules .    due to the relative ease of analytical treatment ,",
    "another regime which attracted attention is that of inertial particles in a smooth random velocity field , with correlation time @xmath5 much shorter than the geometric scale @xmath6 obtained from the correlation length @xmath7 and the amplitude @xmath8 of the velocity field fluctuations @xcite .",
    "however , this is a short - time correlated regime that is very different from the situation in realistic turbulent flows : @xmath9 .    the analysis of random velocity field models has allowed to identify at least two clustering mechanisms , expected to be present also in real turbulence .",
    "the first one , originally proposed in @xcite , is preferential concentration of heavy ( light ) particles in the strain ( vortical ) regions of the flow .",
    "this effect has been recently observed also in the case of particles with very small inertia @xcite .",
    "the second mechanism , already present in one dimension ( 1d ) @xcite , is that of the particles catching one another in their motion , as they slip with respect to the fluid . in the case of smooth velocity fields",
    ", this leads to the formation of caustics in the instantaneous concentration field , which , in turn , act as back - bones for the clustering process @xcite .",
    "the clustering itself is a long - time process , which can be described in terms of the lyapunov exponents of the particle pair dynamics @xcite .",
    "focusing on the second mechanism , it appears that caustics formation tends to become maximum for @xmath10 @xcite , and that , at the same time , clustering becomes weaker . for larger @xmath4",
    ", one expects that the particles be scattered by the velocity fluctuations they cross in their motion @xcite as if undergoing brownian diffusion , resulting in vanishing particle correlations and in clustering destruction .",
    "it is to be stressed that the interest of this limit is by no means academic , as particles in turbulent flows for which @xmath4 lies in the inertial range ( or above ) , will see smaller vortices precisely in this way .",
    "purpose of this paper is to understand in detail how and under which conditions the uncorrelated limit described in @xcite is achieved .",
    "it will appear that clustering destruction occurs in a very non trivial way , requiring consideration , among the other things , of how particle correlations decay at scales comparable with or above @xmath7 .",
    "we are going to show that , provided we are away from the short correlation time regime @xmath11 , clustering at @xmath12 will not be dominated by the small - separation particle pair dynamics ( small with respect to @xmath7 ) described in @xcite .",
    "particle pairs remaining close long enough for a lyapunov exponent approach to be appropriate , are still present , but their contribution to concentration fluctuations is negligible .    the key mechanism for the destruction of concentration fluctuations will appear to be that , at large @xmath13 and finite @xmath14 , only particles with increasingly small relative velocities ( but not small enough for a local theory on the lines of @xcite to be valid ) have a chance to be correlated .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the picture in @xcite , of correlation fluctuations disappearing as caustics occupy in the above limit larger and larger portions of space , and with the one in @xcite of saturation to the space dimension of the particle distribution correlation dimension . neither in @xcite nor in @xcite , however , was a quantitative prediction on clustering decrease provided .",
    "the present analysis will also allow to show that , for large @xmath13 and rather generic ( not too large ) values of @xmath15 , clustering is associated with smaller typical relative inter - particle velocities , compared to what would be observed in the absence of correlations .",
    "thus , there are circumstances under which , clustering may hinder rather than enhance coalescence phenomena .",

    "as particle clusters are the result of particle pairs with small relative velocities , the total velocity pdf will be weighed more to small relative velocities .",
    "this results in a depletion of the relative velocity variance , quantified in the exact relation ( [ eq16.02 ] ) , that becomes substantial at @xmath181 .",
    "it is to be ascertained whether this property is preserved in more than 1d .",
    "summarizing , we have the following situation : extrapolating the small @xmath55 theory of @xcite to @xmath182 , predicts that clusters become less and less singular , making eventually a transition from fractal to space - filling objects . extrapolating the opposite way around",
    ", the present large @xmath55 theory predicts  residual  ( not singular ) concentration fluctuations , becoming of the order of the mean concentration as @xmath183 , due to more and more particle pairs contributing to the fluctuations .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the situation at @xmath181 will be a combination of the two pictures .    in @xcite , it was suggested that clustering is not central in determining collision rates of relevance e.g. in rain formation , as instead are caustics formation and a finite width of the velocity distribution .",
    "if the present picture continues to hold in more than 1d , it would result in an even stronger statement , that is , at large @xmath55 , clustering and modifications to the velocity distribution work against one another .",
    "this is in some way analogous to the situation at @xmath109 , of clustering dominance accompanied by caustics disappearance and vanishing of collision rates @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "another feature of concentration fluctuations at large @xmath55 , is the strong scale separation between their decay length and the correlation length of the fluid : the first is by a factor @xmath184 larger than the second [ see eq . ( [ eq17 ] ) ] .",
    "the concentration fluctuation decay length is basically the distance travelled by a particle in a stokes time and is independent of the fluid correlation structure .",
