    "high accurate clocks comparison and synchronization are important for fundamental physics research and practical applications , such as , global navigation satellite systems ( gnsss ) , power transmission grid , telecommunication , distributed network , etc .",
    "there are several modern protocols to synchronize remote clocks , such as network time protocol ( ntp ) , precision time protocol ( ptp ) , and gnsss@xcite .",
    "ntp is a method to synchronize clocks by means of message passing over the internet .",
    "its nominal accuracy is in the low tens of milliseconds on wide area networks to sub - milliseconds on a local area network . for the ptp described in ieee 1588@xcite , it is possible to synchronize distributed clocks with an accuracy of less than 1 microsecond via ethernet networks . in the widely used gnss scheme ,",
    "the two - way satellite time and frequency transfer method@xcite , which takes advantage of exchanging modulated signals between two sites to cancel most effects that impact on the accuracy , is at the level of one nanosecond@xcite .",
    "recently , some new methods both in theory and experiment have been reported to improve the accuracy of remote clock synchronization to the level of few picoseconds .",
    "one is the time transfer through optical fibers , which can reach the accuracy of 100 ps due to the wider bandwidth of the transmission@xcite .",
    "another way is the time transfer by laser link ( t2l2 ) , by using the propagation of light pulses between satellite and ground clocks or between remote clocks on the earth@xcite .",
    "the expected performance of t2l2 is in the 100 ps range for accuracy , with an ultimate time stability about 1 ps over 1,000 s and 10 ps over 1 day@xcite . with the help of quantum entanglement ,",
    "several quantum clock synchronization schemes have been proposed in theory@xcite , they provide a new way to synchronize remote clocks , and the accuracy can even reach a level of the standard quantum limit .",
    "experimental demonstration of quantum clock synchronization using entangled photon pairs has been carried out by valencia et al.@xcite .",
    "this method relied on the measurement of the second - order time - correlation function of entangled photons , and can achieve a resolution of picoseconds . ho",
    "et al . provided an algorithm to detect the time and frequency differences of independent clocks based on the remote coincidence identification of time - correlated photon pairs@xcite . using the algorithm ,",
    "remote clocks can be synchronized without dedicated coincidence hardware or very stable reference clocks with nanosecond precision .    in this paper",
    ", we present a remote clock comparison experiment using time - correlated photon pairs generated from the spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) process of a laser pumped beta - barium borate ( bbo ) crystal . using the cross correlation method ,",
    "we have identified the time - correlated photon pairs events that detected by two remote clocks .",
    "the time difference of the two clocks is obtained via the cross correlation and peak searching process at a 64 ps resolution , and the standard deviation of the time difference is 55.92 ps . this scheme can be used in quantum communication and quantum position systems to improve the precision of clock synchronization .",
    "the process of comparing remote clocks with time - correlated photon pairs is similar to the problem of time delay estimation@xcite .",
    "the arrival times of single photons are recorded as time stamps , and it can be mathematically modeled as , @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the arrival time sequences of the photons to detectors , and @xmath2 represent the erroneous time stamps caused by detector s dark counts and background light .",
    "the signals @xmath3 are assumed to be uncorrelated with noises @xmath4 , and the noises @xmath4 are also uncorrelated with each other .    for the comparison of two remote clocks , we calculate the cross correlation of two time sequences @xmath5 and @xmath6 . by a linear searching process , the time difference of clocks can be found in the peak position of cross correlation function , i.e. @xmath7\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the cross correlation of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and can be calculated via fast fourier transformations ( fft ) and their inverse@xcite , @xmath9 = \\mathcal{f}^{-1}[\\mathcal{f}^{*}[a ] \\cdot \\mathcal{f } [ b]]\\ ] ] where @xmath10 denotes the expectation ; @xmath11 represent fft and it s inverse ; superscript * indicates complex conjugate operation .",
    "the schematic of the clock comparison experiment is given in . a 403 nm laser diode with 30 mw power impinges on a type - ii non - collinear cutting 2 mm long bbo crystal to generate two down - converted photons with degenerated wavelength centered at 806 nm .",
    "the two single photons are then distributed via channel a and channel b to two remote sites , where there are two clocks ( clock a and clock b ) need to be synchronized . after flying in free space and",
    "collected by optical systems , single photons are detected by si avalanche photo diodes ( perkinelmer spcm - aqrh-16 ) with response - time jitter about 350 ps@xcite .",
    "the arrival times of single photons at the detectors are recorded by two event timers ( a033-et ) .",
    "the event timer is connected with a rubidium clock ( srs 625 with the frequency stability @xmath12 in 10 seconds ) and locked to the rubidium clock s 10 mhz oscillator .",
    "when the detector receives a single photon , the event timer generates an output signal of the arrival time of the single photon .",
    "so , during the acquisition time , we get two sequences of arrival time stamps @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    to characterize the time - correlation of down - converted photons ,",
    "we employ the hardware coincidence method to measure the coincidence time distribution . in this method ,",
    "the hardware coincidence equipment consists of a nanosecond delay ( ortec 425a ) , a time - to - amplitude converter ( tac ) , and a multi - channel analyzer ( mca ) .",
    "one of the output signal from the two single photon detectors is used as the start signal of tac , and the other one as the stop signal after passing through a nanosecond delay , the coincidence time distribution of the two - photon is recorded in mca by measuring the the pulse height distribution of the output of tac . the result is shown in , in which the time axis represents the relative delay of two photons , the full - width at half - maximum of the coincidence time distribution peak is 0.698 ns .",
    "it s a combine effect of detector jitter , electric delay in tac , and the bin size of mca , but mainly due to the detector s response - time jitter .",
    "a bandpass interference filter with 3 nm bandwidth and @xmath15 transmissivity is used to block the background light . during a 10 seconds sampling period ,",
    "4207 coincidence counts are recorded .",
    "the average coincidence detection rate is about 420 counts per second to ensure that there are sufficient number of two - photon events to find the time difference of remote clocks",
    ".     represents the relative delay of two single photons , and the vertical axis is the number of coincidence counts in corresponding relative delay . ]      generally , the common method for finding the time difference is to calculate the cross correlation of two signals and to select the peak of in cross correlation result as the estimate of the time difference @xmath16 .    in the clock comparison process",
    ", if we directly calculate the cross correlation , the size of fft arrays will exceed @xmath17 ( for time resolution of 10 ps and 0.1 s acquisition time ) .",
    "it s a time - consuming process and also impractical .",
    "to solve this problem , we use the method proposed by ho et al.@xcite , to calculate the coarse and fine parts of @xmath16 separately in a moderate size . then , combining the results of the two parts , a high resolution result can be obtained . in this method ,",
    "the time stamp sequences are converted into discrete arrays with a time resolution @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the size of discrete arrays , and the same for @xmath21 .",
    "then , substitute @xmath22 and @xmath21 into the equations and , we can obtain the peak position corresponding to a resolution @xmath18 and modulo @xmath23 .",
    "the time difference of two time stamp sequences may be very long that a large size of the discrete array is needed . in practice , we adjust the two sequences and make them align left .",
    "firstly , the difference of the first time stamps of each sequence , named as @xmath24 , is calculated by a subtract operation .",
    "based on @xmath25 , the two sequences are adjusted to make the first element of each sequence identical . then , the relative offset of two revised sequences @xmath26 is calculated by the cross correlation method . finally , by simply adding the relative offset @xmath26 to the first time stamp difference @xmath25 , the time difference of two time stamp sequences can be expressed as @xmath27 .    in the cross correlation calculation",
    ", the noise events may lead to a high background which seriously smooth the correlation peak . in the worse case",
    ", it maybe give a false result .",
    "generally , the noise events can be remit by using the prefilter method in generalized correlator@xcite .",
    "we use a simple method to get rid of the obvious noise events . at first , check the adjacent time stamps , if they are from the same detector , then drop the previous one and compare with the next one , continue until the adjacent events are from different detectors .",
    "secondly , set a threshold @xmath28 , and remove the adjacent pairs with time difference exceed the threshold . with this method ,",
    "most of the obvious uncorrelated events can be eliminated and only the events with the most probability to be similar to the true two - photon pairs maintained .      for a efficiently cross correlation calculation , we define the size of cross correlation array @xmath29 , and set the coarse resolution as @xmath30ps .",
    "the corresponding acquisition time is @xmath31ps to make sure that there are enough photon pairs events in the subset of the time stamp sequence .",
    "one subset is extracted during the acquisition time and there are 3097 time stamps from sequence a , and 4094 from sequence b. the first time stamps difference @xmath25 of the two subset sequences is @xmath32ps",
    ". then , the two sequences are revised , and the relative offset @xmath26 is calculated using the method in with different resolutions in @xmath30ps , @xmath33ps , @xmath34ps , and @xmath35ps , respectively .",
    "the cross correlation results of the two revised sequences are show in .",
    "the peaks in at resolution @xmath36ps , at resolution @xmath37ps , and at resolution @xmath34ps are sharp enough to be identified with sufficient significance .",
    "consider the situation at resolution @xmath35ps or below , as shown in , it s hard to uniquely identify an obvious signal peak .",
    "in such case , the cross correlation of the two - photon events is submerged in noise that mainly caused by the jitter of detectors and the background light .",
    "the clock comparison results of the selected subset time stamp sequences are shown in .",

    "to analyze the effects of hardware devices , such as the rubidium clocks , event timers , and single photon detectors on the precision of clock synchronization system , we propose four different schemes , named as scheme i - iv shown in . in schemes i - iii , two square pulse signals with 1mhz frequency and 2% duty ( the pulse width is 20ns , just for simulating the output electric pulse of the single photon detector ) from a signal generator are used as the input signals of the clock comparison system . in scheme",
    "i , two input signals connect with the two channels of one event timer , and the event timer connects with a clock ; for scheme ii , each input signal connects with an event timer , two event timers connect with the same clock ; and in scheme iii , each input signal connects with an event timer , but the two event timers connect with different clocks ; the scheme in is defined as scheme iv , which is the same as scheme iii except that the two input signals are generated from two single photon detectors .        in the schemes i - iii ,",
    "two time stamp sequences are recorded as @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and each sequence contains 7500 time stamps .",
    "the relative time difference of two sequences @xmath52 and @xmath51 can be directly obtain by a subtraction operation .",
    "the standard deviation of the relative time difference is calculated to character the performance of system . by comparing different schemes",
    ", the effects of system components can be analyzed individually .    at first",
    ", the influence of event timers is analyzed by comparing scheme i with scheme ii .",
    "we ignore the difference in the two channels of one event timer .",
    "the only difference in these two schemes is the event timer .",
    "the standard deviation of the relative time difference of two input signals in scheme i is @xmath53ps , the distribution and the histogram of the relative time difference in scheme i is shown in and .",
    "the result for scheme ii is that @xmath54ps , and the statistical results are shown in and . for event timers ,",
    "the standard deviations of total error in measurement of time intervals between events are calibrated as @xmath55ps , @xmath56ps .",
    "so , we can see that there is no obvious difference in the results of scheme i and scheme ii , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are almost the same .",
    "therefore , the effect of event timers on the precision of clock comparison can be ignored when different equipments are used in remote sites .",
    "secondly , the effect of clock s frequency offset is investigated by comparing scheme ii and scheme iii .",
    "if the two clocks used in experiments have exactly the same frequency , i.e. @xmath59 , then the contribution of two - photon events will all end up in a single time bin in the cross correlation calculation . while for the case @xmath60 , the correlated events will spread out , and the arrival time stamps of the single photon streams become @xmath61 .",
    "this can not only reduce the intensity of the cross correlation peak , but also increase the width of the peak . in scheme",
    "ii the two event timer are connected to the same atomic clock , which corresponds to the case that two clocks with no frequency offset . while in scheme",
    "iii the two event timer are connected to different atomic clocks , and there may exist some frequency offset . for scheme iii ,",
    "the standard deviation of the measured relative time difference is @xmath62ps , and the statistical results are shown in and . compared with the results in scheme ii , @xmath63 is larger than @xmath64 .",
    "it means that the offset in clock frequency will decrease the precision of the clock comparison .",
    "as the frequency stability of rubidium clock is @xmath12 , the time drift during the acquisition time ( @xmath65 ) is about 8.69ps .",
    "thus for the 64ps resolution , i.e. a 64ps coincidence window for time - correlated photon pair events , the time drift caused by frequency offset could not affect the cross correlation result . only in the cases that the resolution is comparable to the time drift or even small ( i.e. time resolution less than 8.69ps ) ,",
    "the effects of the time drift caused by frequency offset on clock comparison need to be considered .",
    "finally , the effect of single photon detector s time jitter is studied by comparing scheme iv with scheme iii .",
    "the difference of the two schemes is that the signal from single photon detector has a random time jitter along with background noise .",
    "similar to the mechanism that the clock s frequency offset affects the cross correlation , the detector s time jitter leads to a random fluctuation of the single photon s arrival time . as shown in ,",
    "the standard deviation of the time differences in scheme iv at 64ps resolution is @xmath66ps , whereas in scheme iii @xmath62ps .",
    "therefore , the detector s time jitter and the background noise seriously degrade the accuracy of the clock comparison .",
    "in conclusion , a 64ps precision for clock comparison has been realized using the time - correlated two - photon pairs .",
    "the time difference of two remote clocks is calculated by cross correlation method and the peak searching process after eliminating the obvious noise events .",
    "the influences of the event timer , the clock s frequency offset , and the single photon detector s time jitter are analyzed by comparing four schemes with different hardware devices in the clock comparison system .",
    "the results show that the main influence is the detector s time jitter and background noise , the clock s frequency offset may degrade the performance of system depending on the coincidence window , and the effect of event timer can be ignored .",
    "in addition , as we know that a 67 km fiber - optical quantum key distribution system@xcite and a 144 km free space transmission of entangled photon pairs have been realized in experiments@xcite , combining the two - photon assisted clock comparison scheme with the technologies in quantum communication , high precision synchronization between long distance separated clocks could be realized in future .",
