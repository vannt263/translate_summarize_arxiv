    "in systems composed of a huge number of interacting particles , a continuous macroscopic behavior emerges after space and time variables are suitably rescaled . in this _ hydrodynamic limit _ , the intrinsic granularity of the basic constituents is lost and the system is described by continuous fields ( such as matter or charge densities , currents , magnetization , etc . ) , coupled by partial differential equations .",
    "the program of developing a mathematical theory of hydrodynamic limits for general systems was posed by hilbert @xcite in his 6th problem , and is still far from completion .    in the last 30 years",
    ", a significant progress in deriving hydrodynamic limits has been achieved in the realm of lattice gases with stochastic microscopic dynamics @xcite . in particular , for stochastic lattice gases with simple conservative interactions such as exclusion processes it was shown @xcite that a coarse - grained density @xmath0 satisfies the macroscopic conservation equation , @xmath1 , with local current @xmath2 given by fick s law , @xmath3 .",
    "the diffusivity @xmath4 depends on the microscopic dynamical rules and calculating it is a very challenging problem .",
    "the hydrodynamic limit describes the deterministic evolution of the density field @xmath0 defined as a local , coarse - grained empirical average over microscopic configurations .",
    "this is analogous to the law of large numbers @xcite .",
    "the next step is to investigate fluctuations around the average , i.e. , to find a property analogous to the central limit theorem for interacting lattice gases .",
    "a non - rigorous but physically well - motivated approach is to consider the density and current as stochastic fields coupled by mass conservation , @xmath5 , and to add a random contribution to the constitutive equation that relates current to density : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is a gaussian white noise .",
    "the amplitude of the noise depends on the second transport coefficient @xmath8 known as conductivity ( or mobility ) .",
    "similarly to the diffusivity , the conductivity is a function of the local density .",
    "the conductivity @xmath8 depends on the microscopic rules .",
    "the two transport coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath8 are difficult to calculate .",
    "if one of them is known , however , it is usually simple to determine the other due to the einstein relation . for lattice gases , the einstein relation acquires a simple form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the equilibrium free energy density per site .    although a rigorous derivation of the stochastic partial differential equation obtained from is lacking , the predictions agree with available exact results established for special lattice gases , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "there are also independent mathematical arguments supporting the large deviation principle implied by the stochastic langevin equation based on .",
    "this is the starting point of the macroscopic fluctuation theory that describes diffusive interacting particle models in infinite domains and in finite systems connected to reservoirs at different temperatures ( or chemical potentials ) @xcite .",
    "as long as the local equilibrium is satisfied , the macroscopic fluctuation theory is applicable to far from equilibrium regimes .",
    "thus , understanding of macroscopic behaviors , both the deterministic ( hydrodynamic ) part and fluctuations around it , requires knowledge of two transport coefficients : @xmath4 and @xmath8 .",
    "the einstein relation implies that it suffices to determine one coefficient .",
    "we focus on @xmath4 which is especially important since it governs the hydrodynamic behavior .    in recent years",
    ", a significant effort has been devoted to the calculation of transport coefficients for various lattice gases .",
    "when a stochastic lattice gas satisfies a special property known as the gradient condition @xcite , the computations become feasible .",
    "the gradient property states that the microscopic current is the gradient of a local function ( i.e. , loosely speaking , fick s law is already valid at the microscopic level ) .",
    "the simplest lattice gas obeying the gradient property is a collection of non - interacting random walkers  in this case @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the simplest interacting gradient lattice gas is the symmetric simple exclusion process @xcite for which @xmath13 and @xmath14 . other gradient lattice gases for which the diffusivity has been computed include the katz - lebowitz - spohn model with symmetric hopping @xcite , repulsion processes @xcite , a lattice gas of leap - frogging particles @xcite , an exclusion process with avalanches @xcite . in these models , an exact expression for the diffusivity can also be derived by a ` perturbation approach ' : one writes the current at the discrete lattice level and performs a continuous limit assuming the density field to be slowly varying .",
    "generic interacting particle processes do _ not _ satisfy the gradient condition ; the computation of the diffusivity in such gases appears intractable .",
    "nevertheless , there exists an exact variational formula for the diffusivity @xmath4 derived by varadhan and spohn @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this rather abstract formula is valid for general lattice gases regardless of the gradient condition , it expresses @xmath4 as a minimum of a functional over certain classes of functions . in simple cases ,",
    "the functional is quadratic and the minimization gives a set of linear equations ; generally it is unclear how to determine the minimum because the function space is infinite - dimensional .    in this work",
    "we demonstrate that the abstract variational formula for the diffusivity can be used as a tool to derive explicit ( albeit approximate ) formulas .",
    "we implement a systematic approximation procedure for @xmath4 by minimizing over finite - dimensional subspaces of the infinite - dimensional function space .",
    "the simplest approximation gives exact results for gradient lattice gases .",
    "for general lattice gas , this iterative scheme can be carried out analytically as far as one wishes , though the complexity of calculations rapidly increases with the dimensionality of the subspace .",
    "the precision greatly improves after each step .",
    "the general idea of approximately solving a variational problem is widely known in science and engineering .",
    "for instance , it underlies the ritz method . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "it is known as the variational method used e.g. in finding approximations to the ground state , and also to excited states .",
    "this venerable idea has not yet been applied to compute the diffusivity , mostly because the varadhan - spohn formula is little known , and has the reputation of being a very abstract object difficult to apply to concrete calculations .",
    "furthermore , an approximate variational procedure based on the varadhan - spohn formula requires very long calculations even for the simplest non - gradient lattice gases .",
    "therefore one would like to choose a non - gradient lattice gas which is natural and sufficiently simple to be amenable to analysis .",
    "exclusion processes ( lattice gases with at most one particle per site ) appear to be good candidates , they are widely used in conceptual developments such as testing far - from - equilibrium behaviors ( see @xcite ) , and in various applications ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the basic example , the symmetric simple exclusion process , is gradient . in non - gradient exclusion",
    "processes the range of hopping is increased or there are interactions between particles occupying neighboring sites . in such situations the dimensionality of the subspace also increases  this makes computations unwieldy , and even more so if equilibrium is not given by a product measure @xcite .",
    "a rather simple non - gradient lattice gas with product measure is the 2-gep , a generalized exclusion process ( gep ) in which each site can host at most 2 particles .",
    "the 2-gep is additionally parametrized by hopping rates depending on the occupancy levels . the 2-gep is the first member in the family of @xmath15-gep , where @xmath16 is the maximal occupancy .",
    "the @xmath15-geps are non - gradient for all @xmath16 and for generic hopping rates ; the notable exception is the misanthrope process @xcite .",

    "we start with the general @xmath15-gep and then discuss the 2-gep which is the main focus of our study . in the following we consider lattice gases in one dimension and",
