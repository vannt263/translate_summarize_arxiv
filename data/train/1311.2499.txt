    "the problem of the origin of spin glitches in neutron stars has remained unsolved since the first glitch was observed in the vela pulsar in 1969 .",
    "this difficult problem is of considerable interest , as an understanding of the glitch phenomenon would offer insights into both the dynamical and ground - state properties of matter above nuclear density . to make progress on the glitch problem",
    ", it is crucial to identify which components of the liquid interior corotate with the crust , which store and release the angular momentum that drives glitches , and which produce the observed post - glitch response that occurs over days to years ( for examples , see @xcite ) .",
    "a more complete understanding of the processes that regulate post - glitch response would be very useful for elucidating the dynamical properties of the neutron star interior .",
    "fortunately , it is possible to address this problem without knowledge of the basic instability that causes glitches , and progress is possible with minimal assumptions .",
    "the neutron star interior was predicted long ago to contain superfluid neutrons and superconducting protons ( @xcite ; for recent reviews , see @xcite and @xcite ) . as in all rotating neutral superfluids ,",
    "the neutron superfluid is threaded by an array of quantized vortices whose arrangement determines the angular momentum of the superfluid , and whose motion determines the torque exerted on the charged components of the star and the crust . in laboratory liquid helium , vortices _ pin _ to bumps on the bottom of the vessel , trapping the system in metastable rotational states . as the vessel is spun down ,",
    "jumps in its spin rate are observed @xcite , much like the glitches observed in neutron stars , as vortices unpin and the superfluid transfers angular momentum to the vessel .",
    "vortex pinning is predicted to occur throughout much of a neutron star , with the vortex lines pinning to sites along their length . in the inner crust , where a neutron superfluid coexists with the ionic lattice ,",
    "vortices interact with nuclei with energies of @xmath4 mev per nucleus @xcite .",
    "this interaction pins the vortex lattice to the nuclear lattice , as confirmed by the simulations of @xcite . in the outer core ,",
    "the neutron flow around the vortices that thread the rotating superfluid entrains a proton mass current , strongly magnetizing the vortices as shown in the seminal work of @xcite . here",
    "the protons are expected to form a type ii superconductor , with the magnetic flux arranged in flux tubes that are frozen to the highly - conductive charged component of the fluid .",
    "the proton superconductor rotates as a rigid body , without forming vortices .",
    "the vortices of the neutron superfluid pin to the flux tubes , primarily through a magnetic interaction , with pinning energies as high as @xmath5 mev per vortex - flux tube junction @xcite .",
    "while pinning energies remain rather uncertain , the conclusion that vortices pin to inner - crust nuclei and outer - core flux tubes is on solid ground .",
    "the nature of the glitch instability is a problem under active research , and many possibilities have been suggested . as originally suggested by @xcite",
    ", glitches could represent sudden unpinning of many vortices ; as liberated vortices move under dissipation , a spin - up torque is exerted on the crust plus charged components . in this connection",
    ", glitches could arise through a vortex avalanche from a critical state @xcite .",
    "other possibilities include increased frictional coupling from sudden heating of the crust @xcite such as by a starquake , crust failure under superfluid stresses @xcite , or interactions of magnetized flux tubes in the outer core with the london current near the core boundary @xcite .",
    "@xcite has proposed that glitches result from the motion of a vortex sheet into a region where pinning is not sustainable .",
    "alternatively , glitches might represent transitions between different states of superfluid turbulence @xcite , though these studies do not account for vortex pinning which is likely to play an important role in the dynamics .",
    "recent work has shown that pinning is hydrodynamically unstable in both the inner crust @xcite and the outer core @xcite ; further work is need to see how the instability saturates , and if the system turns turbulent .",
    "vortex pinning decreases the rotational coupling between the portions of the superfluid in which there is pinning and the rest of the star . if vortices remained perfectly pinned between glitches , the decoupling would be complete , and the superfluid would exert no torque on the charged components of the star ( the crust , electrons , and core proton fluid ) . at finite temperature , though , vortices move through thermal activation over their pinning barriers , with an associated coupling time that is generally far longer than without pinning .",
    "post - glitch response has been ascribed to internal torques exerted on the crust as the pinned superfluid responds to the glitch through thermally - activated vortex motion , as in the `` vortex creep theory '' of @xcite , hereafter aaps , that has been substantially developed and used to fit pulsar timing data @xcite .    in vortex",
    "creep theory there are two dynamical regimes : the `` non - linear creep '' regime introduced by aaps , and the `` linear creep '' regime introduced by @xcite . in the `` non - linear creep '' regime ,",
    "the system is always near the threshold for vortex unpinning .",
    "post - glitch response is determined by two timescales , the _ decoupling time _",
    "@xmath3 and the _ recoupling time _",
    "@xmath6 , and post - glitch response depends non - linearly on the size of the glitch .",
    "is denoted @xmath7 , and is called the  offset time \" , while @xmath6 is denoted @xmath8 , and is called the `` relaxation time '' . ]",
    "typical response in the  nonlinear \" creep regime is depicted in figure [ response_resid ] ; the system remains out of equilibrium for a time @xmath3 , before recovering over a time @xmath6 , with a total response time of @xmath9 .",
    "by contrast , in the  linear creep \" regime post - glitch response depends linearly on the size of the glitch , and consists of simple exponential recovery over one timescale rather than two .",
    "the  linear creep \" regime is generally associated with regions in which pinning is very weak , termed  superweak pinning \" by aaps .",
    "the `` non - linear creep regime '' does admit linear response in the limit @xmath10 .",
    "the important dynamical difference between the two regimes is that the total recovery time can be very short in the  linear creep \" regime , but always exceeds @xmath3 in the  non - linear \" regime .",
    "as vortex creep theory became more developed , terms were introduced in the crust response to account for internal torques from different parts of the star , vortex depletion regions , and crust cracking ; see , , @xcite .",
    "prompt exponential response is introduced by assuming the existence of regions that are in the `` linear creep '' regime .",
    "fits to data introduce many free parameters , and do not offer conclusions with which the theory can be refuted . in particular , the  linear creep \" regime , which gives simple exponential response independent of glitch magnitude , is not well - constrained by observations as it is observationally indistinguishable from vortex motion in a drag regime in which there is no pinning at all ( see section [ dragregime ] ) .    inspired by the work of aaps , the purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive theory of thermally - activated vortex motion in the inner crust and the outer core with which to interpret existing and future glitch data and , in particular , to make _",
    "falsifiable predictions_. the theory developed here , which i call `` thermally - activated vortex slippage '' or `` vortex slippage '' , to distinguish it from the `` vortex creep theory '' of aaps , begins with a derivation of the vortex velocity from the vorticity equations of motion , an ingredient that is lacking from the vortex creep theory of aaps and its extensions .",
    "the activation energy for vortex slippage is obtained from a detailed study of the mechanics and energetics of vortex motion .",
    "a key conclusion of this paper is that the  linear creep \" regime invoked in vortex creep theory is not realized for physically reasonable parameters .",
    "the  linear creep \" regime relies on vortex motion anti - parallel to the magnus force to be nearly equal to vortex motion parallel to the magnus force . here",
    "i show that the anti - parallel motion is so strongly suppressed by the large vortex self - energy as to be negligible .",
    "fits to post - glitch data that invoke this regime @xcite should therefore be reassessed . without a `` linear creep '' regime of vortex response ,",
    "the problem of vortex motion through thermal activation becomes strongly constrained ; effectively , only the  non - linear \" regime of thermally - activated vortex motion remains .",
    "a second important conclusion is that  superweak pinning \" , which plays a key role in vortex creep theory , probably does not occur but is eliminated by thermal fluctuations .",
    "the other conclusions of this paper are in _ qualitative _ agreement with the  non - linear \" regime studied by aaps .",
    "in particular :    1 .   if pinning occurs , post - glitch response through thermally - activated vortex slippage consists of two distinct phases .",
    "first , the pinned superfluid is _ decoupled _ from the crust over a timescale @xmath3 , during which the external torque acts on a lower moment of inertia , and the crust spins down at a greater rate . after a time @xmath3 , a region in which there is pinning will recouple over a timescale @xmath6 .",
    "the total recovery time from the glitch is @xmath9 .",
    "post - glitch response generally depends _ non - linearly _ on the initial conditions .",
    "2 .   for a glitch in the spin rate of magnitude @xmath0 ,",
    "the decoupling time is @xmath11 where @xmath2 is the spin - down age .",
    "this timescale represents a _",
    "lower limit _ for the duration of post - glitch response .",
    "if the recoupling time @xmath6 satisfies @xmath12 , as can happen in a large glitch , and a portion @xmath13 of the core s moment of inertia participates in the response , the fractional change in @xmath14 is @xmath15 depicted by the dashed curve in figure [ response_dresid ] .",
    "identification of this characteristic non - exponential response through analyses of existing and future timing data would give evidence that thermally - activated vortex slippage plays a key role in post - glitch response .",
    "4 .   if a glitch is small enough that @xmath16 is satisfied , the glitch recovers as @xmath17 .",
    "post - glitch response in the vortex slippage theory of this paper is mathematically identical to the  non - linear creep \" regime of aaps , but with crucial quantitative differences . in this paper , the scaling of the recoupling time with the pinning energy @xmath18",
    "is found to be @xmath19 for the inner crust and @xmath20 for the outer core .",
    "by contrast , aaps conclude that @xmath6 is _ independent _ of @xmath18 in the  non - linear \" regime , and exponentially dependent on @xmath18 in the  linear regime \" .",
    "to summarize , the vortex theory of aaps and its extensions has two regimes of vortex motion , the  non - linear \" and  linear \" regimes , while the vortex slippage theory given here has only one , the  non - linear \" regime .",
    "the vortex slippage theory presented here predicts a minimum post - glitch response time of @xmath3 , which is determined by the size of the glitch .",
    "vortex creep theory invokes a  linear creep \" regime that is not realized for physically reasonable parameters , and that gives very short recovery times without a waiting time @xmath3 before the system recouples .",
    "by contrast , in the vortex slippage theory developed in this paper , the total post - glitch response time can only exceed @xmath3 , giving strong constraints on the theory .",
    "this paper presents the theory of thermally - activated vortex slippage , with preliminary comparison with data ; detailed comparisons with data and constraints of the theory will be given in a forthcoming publication .",
    "in section [ overview ] , the implications of post - glitch response are described in terms of a simple but quite general model of the coupling between the crust and the liquid interior . in section [ dragregime ] ,",
    "the response of a neutron star without pinning is reviewed . in section [ pinning ] , pinning of vortices to inner - crust nuclei and outer - core flux tubes",
    "is described . in section [ slippage ] , the theory of thermally - activated vortex slippage is developed . in section [ ae ] ,",
    "the mechanics and energetics of vortex pinning is discussed . in section [ relaxation ] , the relaxation dynamics are calculated and described . in section [ timescales ] , the coupling timescales are estimated for the inner crust and the outer core . in section [ data ] , preliminary comparisons of the calculations with observed post - glitch response are made . in section [ comparison ] , the results are compared with the previous work of aaps and its extensions .",
    "appendix [ transition ] determines the conditions under which vortex pinning disappears , and vortex motion enters the drag regime . appendix [ antiparallel ] shows that vortex motion against the magnus force is strongly suppressed .",
    "appendix [ random_pinning ] shows that vortex pinning is unlikely to occur in the denser regions of the inner crust , including the pasta region , so that the `` superweak pinning '' regime proposed by aaps , a regime that plays a key role in vortex creep theory , is probably ruled out .",
    "post - glitch response shows bewildering variety , with no clear systematics @xcite .",
    "most glitches are consistent with simple steps in the spin rate , with a recovery fraction @xmath21 over timescales of hundreds to thousands of days , as shown schematically in figure [ typical_glitch ] . in many pulsars , the vela pulsar for example",
    ", the spin - down rate of the star does not recover to its post - glitch value before the next glitch occurs @xcite , indicating that rotational equilibrium is never reached ; the internal torque on the star never becomes constant .",
    "the post - glitch response of such pulsars is problematic to study theoretically , since the glitch can not be described as a perturbation about a state of rotational equilibrium .",
    "consider the stellar crust plus charges , component @xmath22 of moment of inertia @xmath23 , coupled to the superfluid interior , component @xmath24 of moment of inertia @xmath25 comprising the neutron superfluids of both the inner crust and the core .",
    "let a glitch occur at @xmath26 . to account for the fact that most glitches do not recover completely ( @xmath27 ) ,",
    "i introduce a third component , component @xmath28 , which imparts angular momentum @xmath29 at the time of the glitch . unlike @xmath22 and @xmath24 , this `` loose screw '' is never in rotational equilibrium",
    "; it couples to @xmath22 only at the time of the glitch , but remains otherwise completely decoupled .",
    "as described in section [ timescales ] , much of the neutron star interior can remain decoupled by glitches if there is pinning ; decoupled components in either the crust or the core could represent the loose screw that drives glitches .",
    "assuming axisymmetry for simplicity , the rotational dynamics of the system is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the external spin - down torque on @xmath22 . sufficiently long after the glitch , the system will relax to _ spin - down equilibrium _",

    "for this situation , @xmath54 lies in the range @xmath55 where @xmath56 corresponds to @xmath57 , while @xmath58 corresponds to @xmath59 .",
    "henceforth i take @xmath57 , a restriction that does not affect the conclusions . ]",
    "the dynamics of a superfluid is determined by the motion of the vortices , which is in turn determined by the dissipative forces on the rotating superfluid . in regions of the star where there is no vortex pinning ,",
    "vortex motion is determined by drag forces . here",
    "i review the dynamics in this regime .",
    "suppose a straight vortex is moving at velocity @xmath60 with respect to its environment",
    ". the environment could be the nuclear lattice of the inner crust , or the proton - electron fluid of the outer core .",
    "the motion of a straight vortex is given by balance between the magnus force on the vortex and the drag force : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the flow velocity of the ambient superfluid in the rest frame of the environment , @xmath63 is the superfluid mass density , @xmath64 is the vorticity quantum where @xmath65 is the neutron mass@xmath66 is directed along the vortex , and @xmath67 is the drag coefficient . and local forces @xcite . ] in cylindrical coordinates @xmath68 , with @xmath69 and @xmath70 along the rotation axis , the vortex velocity is given by the solution of equation [ [ drag ] ] ; see @xcite and @xcite : @xmath71 where the _ dissipation angle _",
    "@xmath72 is given by @xmath73 the vortex moves in direction @xmath74 , at an angle @xmath72 with respect to @xmath62 with a component away from the rotation axis for positive lag @xmath47 .",
    "an important feature of vortex dynamics is that local forces determine the vortex velocity , not the vortex acceleration .",
    "the dissipation angle is simply related to the relaxation time of the system .",
    "assuming axisymmetry , the angular acceleration of the superfluid follows from vorticity conservation ( aaps ; @xcite ) @xmath75 and is determined by the radial component of the vortex velocity which vanishes in the limit of zero dissipation ( @xmath76 ) . assuming uniform superfluid rotation @xmath77 for simplicity , the equation of motion for the angular velocity lag @xmath78 is , from equation [ [ jcons ] ] , @xmath79 linearizing equation [ [ sfeom1 ] ] , assuming constant @xmath72 , and using equation [ [ vv ] ] , gives @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the unperturbed rotational velocity of the superfluid .",
    "assuming spin - down equilibrium with @xmath82 just before the glitch , the solution is @xmath83 from equation [ [ lagdot ] ] , the equilibrium lag is @xmath84    in the @xmath85 model of section [ overview ] , with a spin glitch driven by angular momentum from components @xmath28 , the response for uniform rotation follows from equations [ [ resid ] ] , [ [ jl ] ] , and [ [ jcons ] ] : @xmath86 in this linear treatment , the timescale of relaxation is independent of the size of the glitch .",
    "as described below , vortices are expected to pin to nuclei in the inner crust and to flux tubes in the outer core ( if the outer core is a type ii superconductor ) .",
    "pinning , though , is not expected to occur everywhere in the star .",
    "let us therefore first consider calculated values for the drag strength without pinning , beginning with the inner crust .",
    "if vortices in the inner crust move in the drag regime , the dominant drag at low lag arises from scattering of the moving vortex against the electron - phonon system of the lattice .",
    "@xcite finds @xmath87 , with a typical relaxation time of @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the stellar spin rate .",
    "relaxation through this process is shorter than observed , but the timescale increases significantly as the interaction energy between a nucleus and a vortex is reduced .",
    "@xcite studied the scattering of electrons with the electron cloud induced around a vortex through its interaction with nuclei .",
    "they found @xmath90 , corresponding to a relaxation time of 2000 d for @xmath91 hz .",
    "@xcite considered the scattering of electrons with the magnetic moments of thermally - excited neutrons in the vortex core .",
    "the results are strongly sensitive to the neutron pairing gap and to the temperature . from these calculations , using a range of plausible pairing gaps , @xmath92 can range from @xmath93 to effectively zero .    in the outer core , entrainment of the neutron and",
    "proton mass currents when both species are superfluid endows a vortex with a magnetic field of @xmath94 g @xcite .",
    "electron scattering with the strongly - magnetized vortex cores gives @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "hence , if there is no pinning in the core , electron scattering is so effective that the neutral and charged fluids of the core corotate over timescales @xmath96 .",
    "the core liquid is thus typically considered to corotate with the crust . @xcite and @xcite have obtained the opposite conclusion ; ignoring the natal magnetic field of the neutron star , @xcite and @xcite argue that magnetic flux tubes of the outer core form clusters around vortices , which could increase the coupling time to observable timescales of days or longer .",
    "they suggest that post - glitch response has a core component .",
    "the effects of the natal magnetic field on these conclusions have not been studied , and could prove to be important .",
    "the point of view taken in this paper is that post - glitch response could involve both the inner - crust and core superfluids , and both possibilities will be considered .",
    "as originally pointed out by @xcite and elaborated upon by @xcite and @xcite , vortices of the inner crust interact with nuclei .",
    "the main contribution to this interaction is the density dependence of the superfluid condensation energy per particle .",
    "when the increase of energy associated with the destruction of superfluidity within the vortex core exceeds the corresponding increase inside the nucleus , the energy cost is minimized if the vortex overlaps with the nucleus , giving an attractive interaction .",
    "if the inequality goes the other way , the energy is minimized if the vortices can get as far from nuclei as possible , in which case vortices could pin to the interstices of the nuclear lattice . pinning is predicted to be strongest in the denser regions of the inner crust .",
    "recent pinning calculations generally agree on the magnitude and density dependence of @xmath18 , but not its sign .",
    "@xcite find that the vortex - nucleus interaction energy is @xmath97 mev , and attractive , for baryon densities @xmath98 in the narrow range @xmath99 .",
    "@xcite find a similar interaction strength in this density range , though repulsive .",
    "both calculations show a sharp drop in @xmath100 to nearly zero above @xmath101 .",
    "these calculations did not address the spatial dependence of the interaction , and so only estimates of the pinning force based on the relevant length scales could be obtained .",
    "the length scale of the interaction is of order the coherence length @xmath102 of the neutron superfluid , and so the force per pinning site is @xmath103 for pinning to nuclei .",
    "this estimate should apply for a repulsive interaction as well .",
    "a vortex is an object with finite rigidity ( see below ) , and in order to move through the lattice it must be brought close to nuclei that repel the vortex over a length scale @xmath104 .",
    "hence , nuclear and interstitial pinning should be very similar .",
    ", where @xmath105 is the nuclear spacing .",
    "since @xmath105 is much larger than @xmath104 in regions where they find the interaction to be repulsive , they conclude that interstitial pinning is relatively unimportant , contrary to the argument given here . ]",
    "@xcite , using ginzburg - landau theory , obtained @xmath106 mev ; ginzburg - landau theory is however inadequate for this problem , since the superfluid coherence length is comparable to the size of a nucleus .    above a baryon density @xmath107 , the pinning situation is unclear .",
    "the coherence length exceeds the nuclear spacing @xcite , which weakens pinning . at @xmath108 ,",
    "the nuclei acquire non - spherical pasta shapes @xcite . pinning to nuclear pasta",
    "is probably weaker than pinning to spherical nuclei .",
    "hence , the base of the inner crust could represent a physically distinct region with relatively weak pinning or no pinning .",
    "pinning to nuclear pasta has been studied by @xcite and @xcite , who suggest that a vortex can induce nuclear rod formation along its length , becoming self - pinned .",

    "most of the neutron superfluid is non - dissipatively _ entrained _ by the nuclei and does not participate in the superfluid flow .",

    "the protons of the outer core are predicted to form a type ii superconductor . as the protons condensed when the star was young , the very high electrical conductivity of the relativistically - degenerate electrons prevented meissner expulsion of the core s natal magnetic field @xcite , and the field formed a dense tangle of magnetic flux tubes with which vortices interact .",

    "post - glitch recovery associated with regions in which there is vortex pinning , whether in the inner crust or outer core , requires a time that is _ at least _ as long as the decoupling time : @xmath394 this timescale is independent of the details of vortex pinning , and so is a robust conclusion within the framework of thermally - activated , post - glitch response .",
    "post - glitch response depends non - linearly on the size of the glitch . for a glitch that is sufficiently large that @xmath279 is satisfied",
    ", the response will consist of _ delayed response _ over a time @xmath3 , wherein the star _ spins down at a constant , higher rate , before relaxing over a time @xmath6_. detection of delayed response over a timescale proportional to the glitch magnitude would represent strong evidence for thermally - activated vortex slippage in neutron stars .",
    "3 .   exponential decay can occur only if the glitch is sufficiently small that @xmath16 is satisfied .",
    "hence , exponential decay can occur only over timescales that exceed @xmath3 , which is determined by the size of the glitch .",
    "quicker decay is prevented by the non - linear nature of coupling through thermal activation .",

    "4 .   response over a relatively quick timescale @xmath395 as has been observed in some pulsars , most notably vela , can not be due to thermally - activated vortex motion but must represent a different process , such as drag on vortices in regions where there is no pinning .",
