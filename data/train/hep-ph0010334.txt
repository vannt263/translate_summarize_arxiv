    "quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) , describing the strong interactions , is one of the key components of the standard model .",
    "the determination of its parameters remains an essential task within modern particle physics .",
    "much effort has therefore been put into the study of quark masses . however , in most cases where the system is sensitive to mass effects , also confinement plays an important role . apart from the top mass , the quark masses can thus only be calculated by nonperturbative methods like qcd sum rules @xcite , lattice qcd @xcite or chiral perturbation theory @xcite .    in the past",
    ", qcd moment sum rule analyses have been successfully applied for extracting the charm and bottom quark masses from experimental data on the charmonium and bottonium systems respectively .",
    "the fundamental quantity in these investigations is the vacuum polarisation function @xmath3 : @xmath4 where in the charm case the vector current is represented by @xmath5 . via the optical theorem ,",
    "the experimental cross section @xmath6 is related to the imaginary part of @xmath7 : @xmath8 using a dispersion relation , we can express the moments @xmath9 of @xmath7 by integrals over the spectral density @xmath10 : @xmath11 for convenience , we have defined the moments as dimensionless quantities .",
    "in addition , it will prove useful to express the moments by integrals over the velocity @xmath12 : @xmath13    the moments can either be calculated theoretically , including perturbation theory , coulomb resummation and nonperturbative contributions , or can be obtained from experiment . in this way",
    ", we can relate the charm quark mass to the hadronic properties of the charmonium system .    during the last years , several analyses for the bottonium system",
    "have been performed @xcite . in these investigations , it turned out that the largest theoretical contributions arise from the threshold expansion in the framework of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) which is known up to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) @xcite .",
    "the correlator can be expressed in terms of a greens function , which shows a continuous spectrum above threshold , but also contains poles below threshold .    yet",
    "these new theoretical developments have not been applied to the charmonium system . due to the low scales involved ,",
    "the analysis becomes more delicate here .",
    "we have therefore introduced a new method of analysis which allows for investigation of the influence of the individual contributions on the error . in particular",
    ", we have taken special care in obtaining the pole contributions and the reconstruction of the spectral density above threshold .",
    "so far , we have not specified the mass definition to be used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c ] ) .",
    "a natural choice for this mass is the pole mass @xmath14 . in the first part of our numerical analysis",
    ", we will use the pole mass scheme to extract the charm pole mass .",
    "however , as the pole mass suffers from renormalon ambiguities @xcite , it can only be determined up to corrections of order @xmath15 . in the second part of our analysis",
    "we shall therefore use the recently introduced potential - subtracted mass @xmath16 @xcite . from this mass definition",
    "we can obtain the @xmath17-mass more accurately than from the pole mass scheme .    in the next section",
    ", we shall present the contributions from the threshold expansion in the framework of nrqcd .",
    "the perturbative expansion which is needed for the reconstruction of the spectral density will be discussed in section 3 .",
    "afterwards , we will shortly describe the nonperturbative contributions and the phenomenological spectral function . in the numerical analysis",
    ", we shall first explain the method of analysis .",
    "we will then obtain the pole mass and the @xmath17-mass from an analysis of the pole mass and the ps - mass scheme respectively .",
    "the origin of different contributions to the error will be carefully investigated .",
    "we shall conclude with a summary and an outlook .",
    "close to threshold , it turns out that the relevant expansion parameter is @xmath18 rather than @xmath19 since the velocity becomes of order @xmath19 .",
    "these terms can be resummed in the framework of nrqcd and give the largest contributions to the theoretical moments .",
    "the correlator is then expressed in terms of a greens function @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath14 represents the pole mass .",
    "the constant @xmath22 is a perturbative coefficient which is needed for the matching between the full and the nonrelativistic theory .",
    "it naturally depends on the hard scale .",
    "the greens function is analytically known up to nnlo @xcite and sums up terms of order @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "it is crucial for the analysis that the result depends on three scales .",
    "while the hard scale @xmath26 is responsible for the hard perturbative processes , the soft scale @xmath27 governs the expansion of the greens function .",
    "furthermore , the factorisation scale @xmath28 separates the contributions of large and small momenta and plays the role of an infrared cutoff .",
    "the greens function contains two parts : the continuum above and the poles below threshold respectively .",
    "we are interested in both contributions separately : first , the individual corrections can be analysed and their error estimated .",
    "second , in our numerical analysis we will reconstruct the spectral density above threshold and we thus need the corresponding spectral density at low velocities . in principle , the expressions for the energies and decay widths of the poles have been calculated . however , in the actual case of the charm quark the expansion does not converge well .",
    "we will therefore choose a different method of evaluation @xcite .",
    "since the expansion for the greens function at nnlo is known analytically @xcite , we can evaluate their contribution to the moments numerically by performing the derivatives . on the other hand , by using a dispersion relation , we can derive the continuum from the imaginary part of the correlator . from the difference",
    "we can then obtain the pole contributions : @xmath29 since we will not evaluate the poles near threshold , but rather calculate their contributions to the moments in a region where perturbation theory is expected to be valid , the convergence of the pole contributions is improved .",
    "nevertheless , the poles will give the largest contribution to the theoretical moments and thus the dependence on the scales will remain relatively strong .",
    "in the numerical analysis we will give a detailed account on the size and behaviour of these contributions .",
    "the large corrections are partly due to the definition of the pole mass .",
    "these contributions can be reduced by using an intermediate mass definition . in this analysis",
    "we will use the so - called potential - subtracted ( ps ) mass @xcite where the potential below a separation scale @xmath30 is subtracted : @xmath31 since the qcd potential contains the same renormalon ambiguities as the pole mass , in the difference they are cancelled .",
    "this mass definition thus leads to an improved scale dependence and a more precise determination of the @xmath17-mass .",
    "the perturbative spectral function @xmath10 can be expanded in powers of the strong coupling constant @xmath19 , @xmath32 from this expression the corresponding moments @xmath33 can be calculated via the integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) .",
    "the first two terms are known analytically and can for example be found in ref .",
    "@xmath34 is still not fully known analytically .",
    "however , the method of pad - approximants has been exploited to calculate @xmath35 numerically , using available results at high energies , analytical results for the first eight moments and the known threshold behaviour @xcite .",
    "this information is sufficient to obtain a numerical approximation of @xmath34 in the full energy range .",
    "the numerical stability of the results can be checked in different ways . by choosing different pad - approximants or by selecting a smaller set of input data the results for the moments",
    "remain almost unchanged .",
    "furthermore , some contributions to the spectral density like those from internal quark loops are known analytically and are in very good agreement with the numerical spectral density .",
    "this provides strong support that the numerically obtained spectral density gives a very good approximation to the exact spectral density .",
    "the nonperturbative effects on the vacuum correlator are parametrised by the condensates .",
    "the leading correction is the gluon condensate contribution which is known up to next - to - leading order @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dimension 6 and 8 contributions have been calculated and will be included in our analysis @xcite . in the analysis",
    "below , we have employed a value of @xmath36 for the gluon condensate .",
    "it will turn out that the condensate contributions are suppressed when compared to former charmonium sum rule analyses @xcite and only have little influence on the mass . besides an increase of the theoretical moments from the coulomb contributions we will restrict the moments to @xmath37 where the nonperturbative contributions are relatively small .",
    "since we obtain a larger pole mass than the former analyses , the condensates , starting with a power of @xmath38 , are suppressed further .",
    "experimentally , the lowest lying six @xmath39-resonances have been observed .",
    "since the widths of the poles are very small compared to the masses , the narrow - width approximation provides an excellent description of these states . to model the contributions of the hadronic continuum",
    ", we use the assumption of quark - hadron - duality and integrate over the perturbative spectral density : @xmath40 to estimate the continuum contribution we will use a threshold in the range of @xmath41 gev @xmath42 gev with a central value of @xmath43 gev .",
    "the lower value corresponds to using a perturbative continuum around the @xmath44 but nevertheless including the higher resonance contributions .",
    "this is certainly over - counting the continuum contribution .",
    "the higher value would assume no additional continuum contribution until the @xmath45 resonance .",
    "however , the most dominant phenomenological contributions come from the first two @xmath39-resonances resulting in a small influence of the continuum even for low values of @xmath46 .",
    "besides the contributions from the poles of the greens function and the condensates , the theoretical part of the correlator contains the spectral density above threshold .",
    "now we will discuss the different parts of the spectral density .",
    "a more detailed description of our procedure will be presented in a forthcoming publication @xcite .    for high velocities the spectral density",
    "is well described by the perturbative expansion where we have fixed the hard scale to the pole mass . however , as one approaches smaller values of @xmath47 , the perturbative expansion breaks down .",
    "the resummed spectral density , on the other hand , gives a good description for low values of @xmath47 , but becomes unreliable for high velocities .",
    "for these reasons , we will introduce a separation velocity @xmath48 .",
    "above @xmath49 we will use the perturbative spectral density .",
    "below @xmath49 , we take the resummed spectral density adding the terms which are included in perturbation theory but not in resummation .",
    "thick solid line : reconstructed spectral density ; thin solid line : perturbative spectral density ; dotted line : perturbation theory at nlo ; dashed line : resummed spectral density.,title=\"fig:\",width=415,height=264 ] ( -10.7,7.5)@xmath50 ( -.1,.4)@xmath47    in fig .",
    "[ fig : a ] we have displayed the different contributions .",
    "the dotted line represents the perturbative expansion at nlo .",
    "the thin solid line also includes the nnlo . whereas for high velocities the perturbative expansion is well convergent , the importance of the higher corrections increases for smaller @xmath47 .",
    "the dashed line is the resummed spectral density and the thick solid line the reconstructed spectral density . for the charmonium system",
    ", there exists a range of intermediate values of @xmath47 where neither the perturbative expansion nor the resummation can be trusted .",
    "indeed , it can be clearly seen that the reconstructed spectral density shows a gap at the separation velocity . to estimate the error we have varied @xmath49 between 0.2 and 0.4 .",
    "the analysis shows that though the introduction of the separation velocity stabilises the sum rules , the variation only has a minor influence on the mass .      since the threshold region becomes more important for larger values of @xmath46 , as can already be seen from the factor @xmath51 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) , also the nlo and nnlo corrections grow for larger @xmath46 .",
    "we will therefore restrict our analysis to moments with @xmath37 .",
    "as our method of analysis needs moments of @xmath52 to reconstruct the spectral density , we will use @xmath53 .",
    "since the continuum part of the phenomenological spectral density is relatively small even for low values of @xmath46 , it does not set a lower bound on @xmath46 .",
    "as central values for our scales we have selected : @xmath54",
    "we have set the hard scale equal to the central value for the pole mass .",
    "for the soft scale , we would have liked to choose a value around @xmath55 gev , but the nnlo corrections get out of control for these scales .",
    "thus , we take a central value of @xmath56 gev and vary it in an interval of @xmath57 .",
    "the factorisation scale separates the different regions and should lie between the two other scales .",
    "thick solid line : central pole mass ; thin solid lines : @xmath58 for @xmath59 and 1.5 gev ; dashed lines : @xmath58 for @xmath60 and 1.7 gev ; dotted lines : @xmath58 for @xmath61 and 2.5 gev.,title=\"fig:\",width=415,height=264 ] ( -10.6,7.4)@xmath58 ( 0.1,.3)@xmath46    .[tab : a]moments for different @xmath46 with the parameters @xmath62 gev , @xmath63 gev , @xmath64 gev , @xmath43 gev and @xmath65",
    ". [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table [ tab : g ] we have listed the individual contributions to the error of @xmath16 and @xmath66 . finally , we obtain the masses : @xmath67 when we compare this value of the @xmath17-mass to the one from the last section , @xmath68 gev , we see that the central value remains almost unchanged .",
    "this is not self - evident , as the dominating pole contributions are reduced in the ps - scheme and the relative influence of the individual contributions is shifted .",
    "to summarise , our values obtained for the charm quark pole- and @xmath17-mass are as follows : @xmath69 the obtained value for the pole mass lies somewhat higher than in previous sum rule analyses @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors used perturbation theory to nlo resulting in a value of @xmath70 gev . in the second investigation @xcite",
    "the analysis has been performed in the @xmath17-scheme with perturbation theory to nlo . using the nlo relation to the pole mass the author obtains @xmath71 gev and @xmath72 gev .",
    "the author has also performed an analysis using resummation in lo with a value of @xmath73 gev .    in our analysis",
    "the increased value of the pole mass is essentially due to large coulomb contributions which have not been included in former analyses . as a consequence ,",
    "the error becomes larger as well . in a recent analysis",
    ", the pole mass has been estimated from the charmonium ground state at nnlo @xcite . here",
    "the authors obtained a pole mass of @xmath74 gev .",
    "this value resulted from large corrections of the coulomb potential to the ground state .    during the last years , several lattice analyses obtained the following values for the @xmath17-mass : @xmath75 whereas the results from @xcite are in good agreement with this analysis , the investigations from @xcite and @xcite obtain higher masses . for the time - being ,",
    "the results are not conclusive and future lattice calculations for the charm mass might be of interest .",
    "since other methods reveal significant uncertainties in the determination of the quark masses , qcd sum rules remain amongst the most precise tools to extract these fundamental quantities .",
