    "the discovery of the compton effect @xcite , _",

    "chemistry compton scattering is nowadays an important tool of investigating the momentum distribution of the scattering electrons in the probe .",
    "the inclusion of the electron spin in the calculation of the compton - scattering cross section by klein and nishina @xcite has become one of the textbook examples of applying quantum electrodynamics at lowest order .    in the realm of strong - interaction physics ,",
    "the potential of using compton scattering as a method of studying properties of particles was realized in the early fifties .",
    "the influence of the _ anomalous _ magnetic moment of the proton on the compton - scattering cross section was first discussed by powell @xcite .",
    "the derivation of low - energy theorems ( lets ) , _ i.e. _ , model - independent predictions based upon a few general principles , became an important starting point in understanding hadron structure .",
    "typically , the leading terms of the low - energy amplitude for a given reaction are predicted in terms of global , model - independent properties of the particles . lets provide an important constraint for models or theories of hadron structure : unless these general principles are violated , the predictions of a low - energy theorem must be reproduced .",
    "furthermore , lets also provide useful constraints for experiments as they define a reference point for the precision which has to be achieved in experimental studies designed to distinguish between different models .",
    "based on the requirement of gauge invariance , lorentz invariance , crossing symmetry , and the discrete symmetries , the low - energy theorem for compton scattering ( cs ) of real photons off a nucleon @xcite uniquely specifies the terms in the low - energy scattering amplitude up to and including terms linear in the photon momentum .",
    "the coefficients of this expansion are expressed in terms of global properties of the nucleon : its mass , charge , and magnetic moment .",
    "terms of second order in the frequency , which are not determined by this theorem , can be parameterized in terms of two new structure constants , the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the nucleon .",
    "these polarizabilities have been the subject of numerous experimental and theoretical studies as they determine the first information on the compositeness or structure of the nucleon specific to compton scattering .    as in all studies with electromagnetic probes ,",
    "the possibilities to investigate the structure of the target are much greater if virtual photons are used , since the energy and three - momentum of the virtual photon can be varied independently .",
    "moreover , the longitudinal component of current operators entering the amplitude can be studied .",
    "the amplitude for virtual compton scattering ( vcs ) off the proton is accessible in the reactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in particular , the first process has recently received considerable interest as it allows to investigate generalizations of the rcs polarizabilities to the spacelike region , namely , the so - called generalized polarizabilities @xcite .    the purpose of these lectures is to provide an _ introduction _ to the topics of real and virtual compton scattering .",
    "the material is organized in three chapters .",
    "we start at an elementary level in the framework of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics and discuss basic features of compton scattering .",
    "then , a covariant treatment within quantum field theory is discussed with particular emphasis on a consistent treatment of compositeness in the use of electromagnetic vertices . in the last chapter ,",

    "<S> these lectures give a pedagogical introduction to real and virtual compton scattering at low energies . </S>",
    "<S> we will first discuss real compton scattering off a point particle as well as a composite system in the framework of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of electromagnetic polarizabilities is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> we then address a description of the compton - scattering tensor within quantum field theory with particular emphasis on the derivation of low - energy theorems . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of a consistent treatment of hadron structure in the use of electromagnetic vertices is stressed . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the reader is introduced to the notion of generalized polarizabilities in the rapidly expanding field of virtual compton scattering . </S>"
