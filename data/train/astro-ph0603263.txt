    "the sunyaev - zeldovich(sz ) effect , or the inverse - compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by hot electrons , shifts the spectrum of the cmb photons to higher energy when the photons pass through the regions of cosmic hot gas .    since galaxy clusters are major hosts of hot gas and hot electrons , the sz effect would lead to a correlation between the maps of the cmb temperature fluctuations and the distribution of galaxies on scales of clusters .",
    "several groups have claimed the detection of sz effect signal with the cross - correlation between first year wmap data and samples of galaxy clusters .",
    "hernndez - monteagudo & rubio - martn(2004 ) performed a cross - correlation test between 2mass and wmap for small patches on the sky and found a strong detection ; afshordi et al.(2004 ) detected the sz effect at 3@xmath0 level on small angular scales by cross - correlating the wmap data with the 2mass galaxy catalogue ; fosalba et al.(2004 ) reported a detection of the sz effect cross - correlating the wmap data with large scale structure traced by the sdss data .",
    "while tukugita & peebles(2004 ) have argued that about 90% of all baryons are in the form of intergalactic plasma , but the observational results on the properties of the intra - cluster medium are quite uncertain , amount to @xmath1 of the total are missing(tukugita 2003 ) . since the sz effect are significantly indicated by cross - correlation , which makes the sz detection a powerful tool to constrain the hot gas in- and outside of clusters of galaxies .    however , all these above detections of the sz effect were found mainly on small angular scales and mostly due to clusters .",
    "recently , there are also several authors focus on the cross - correlation between wmap and less bound objects such as loose groups or super - clusters .",
    "myers et al.(2004 ) cross - correlated the wmap data with the apm , aco and 2mass catalogues and detect a sz effect out to @xmath2 angular distance of the cluster centers , which are interpreted as evidence of cluster plasma as well as super - cluster hot gas . with the x - ray based catalogues , hernndez - monteagudo et al.(2004 ) also detect significant sz effect from the clusters , but did not find sz evidence from super - clusters .",
    "these two discrepant results motivate us care for the uncertainty to the model of gas distribution , not simply assume that hot gas are traced by galaxies .",
    "we used the 2mass extended source catalog and developed a biased gas distribution model to study the sz effect from clusters and super - clusters .",
    "the sz effects from 2mass galaxies have been unanimously detected(myers et al . 2004 ; afshordi et al .",
    "2004 ) , which would be useful to test our results.the cross - correlation statistics of this paper are based on the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) , which is more sensitive to detect the sz effect(cao et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    " 2 describes the dwt algorithm used in this paper . in",
    "3,we perform the cross - correlation analysis to constrain the hot gas in both clusters and super - clusters through their sz effect detection .",
    "the discussion and conclusion are given in  4 .",
    "we describe the cmb temperature map and 2mass galaxy distribution by the variables using the 2-d orthogonal dwt decomposition defined as cao et al.(2006 ) : @xmath3 and @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are , respectively , the scaling function and wavelet.the @xmath7 and @xmath8 are called scaling function coefficients ( sfcs ) . for a @xmath9 2-d sample , they describe , respectively , the mean temperature and the mean number density of galaxies in the cell @xmath10 , which has size @xmath11 and at position around @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be any integral , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 . the angular distance between modes @xmath17 and @xmath18 at scale @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 .",
    "the variables @xmath21 and @xmath22 are called wavelet function coefficients ( wfcs ) and describe , respectively , the fluctuations of temperature and galaxy density on scale @xmath23 at position @xmath17 in wavelet space(fang & feng 2000 ) ..      the sz effect is sensitive to hot gas clouds.since @xmath24 is proportional to the mean number density of galaxies , one can identify the sz effect signal with cross - correlation between variables @xmath25 and @xmath8 .",
    "in other words , one can picked up top clusters on scale ( size ) @xmath23 by the top members of @xmath8 .",
    "these clusters are called dwt clusters(xu et al .",
    "1999 ) .    using @xmath8",
    ", we can identify clusters on various scales .",
    "@xmath26 is on the angular scales of @xmath27 , which corresponds to @xmath28 h@xmath29 mpc at the median redshift of the 2mass sample .",
    "therefore , we will first identify the dwt clusters from the 2mass map by the top members of @xmath8 on scales @xmath26 . for studying the sz effect from less bound objects",
    ", we can also pick up the dwt clusters on scale @xmath30 as super - clusters .",
    "we used the foreground cleaned wmap maps of @xmath31 bands(bennett et al .",
    "2003 ) , from which the contamination of the galactic foreground other than sz effect is reduced .",
    "this sample is suitable to study the sz effect.while the galaxy sample are selected from the 2mass extended source catalog ( xsc , jarrett et al .",
    "2000 ) with median redshift @xmath32 .    to carry out the 2-d dwt analysis",
    ", we first take the equal - area lambert azimuthal projection , which projects the whole sky into two circular plane.we then select a @xmath9 square with @xmath33 in the central part of each area .      with these preparations",
    ", we can detect the temperature change of the sz effect with the cross - correlation between the wmap data and the 2mass dwt clusters , defined by @xmath34 where the variable @xmath35 is taken to be 1 for mode(cell ) ( @xmath36 ) corresponding to a dwt cluster on scales @xmath19 , and @xmath37 , other modes .",
    "the average @xmath38 overs all possible @xmath39 of the sample .",
    "therefore , @xmath40 is an average cmb temperature fluctuations with a distance @xmath39 , or the corresponding angular distance @xmath41 from the center of a dwt cluster .",
    "the top panel of fig . 1 presents the cross correlation @xmath42 vs.@xmath43 of @xmath31 band map with the top 500 @xmath26 dwt clusters .",
    "the black points and error bars are , respectively , given by the mean and 1-@xmath0 of the ensemble @xmath44 of the considered dwt cluster sample .",
    "it shows an anti - correlation of the dwt clusters at @xmath45 or @xmath46 with temperature decrease @xmath47 @xmath48k .",
    "this result is about the same as that given by 500 2mass galaxy groups and clusters selected by friends - of - friends algorithm ( myers et al .",
    "what s more , we can see that the anti - correlation occurs not only at @xmath45 , but also slightly at @xmath49 .",
    "myers et al.(2004 ) also found that the strongest anti - correlation is not only at the center of clusters , but on a angular distance larger than a typical clusters .",
    "they suggests that it is due to the sz effect from the super - clusters hot gas .    to detect the sz effect in less bound objects",
    ", we carry the similar cross - correlation for 125 @xmath30 dwt clusters .",
    "we plots @xmath42 vs. @xmath43 for top 125 @xmath30 dwt clusters in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "1 . within error bars",
    ", it shows no cross - correlation , i.e . , there is no sz effect due to super - clusters , which is consistent with the results of hernndez - monteagudo et al.(2004 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the distribution of hot gas probably is not simply proportional to the number density of optical and infrared galaxies , the biased gas distribution model is needed .      with the assumption that galaxies trace hot baryon gas ,",
    "i.e. @xmath50 , cao et al.(2006 ) develop a mock sz effect map as @xmath51 where @xmath21 and @xmath52 are , respectively , the wavelet variables of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath55 is the ratio between the powers of sz effect and cmb temperature fluctuations on scale @xmath19 , which is set to be 0.1 due to the semi - analytical estimation(e.g .",
    "cooray et al .",
    "2004 ) in our analysis .    in this paper",
    ", we improved the mock sz effected cmb maps by the follows : @xmath53 is given by the healpix simulation , @xmath56 is given by the second term of eq.(4 ) , but @xmath57 is taken to be the value given by the 2mass map if the position @xmath58 is not only at the top 500 modes ( @xmath36 ) , but also around @xmath59 .    the top panel of fig.2 plots the cross - correction between the mock sz effected cmb maps and 500 2mass dwt clusters , the points and error bars are respectively , the mean and 90% range of 100 mock samples .",
    "the mock sample surely yield the expected anti - correlation @xmath42 decrease at @xmath45 and the tail at @xmath60 .",
    "we also present the cross - correlation between mock sz effected cmb maps and 125 @xmath30 2mass super - clusters in the bottom panel of fig.2 .",
    "similar to the results of wmap observed map shown in fig.1 , the super - clusters sz effect disappeared , which supported again that the biased gas distribution model are consistent with observations .",
    "these results may be interpreted as that the tail of @xmath42 is from the spread distribution of hot gas around the center of clusters , but not from the super - clusters .",
    "the size of @xmath30 mode is larger than @xmath26 mode by a factor of 4 .",
    "however , top @xmath30 dwt clusters from the 2mass galaxies are less bounded systems , and generally do not always contain top @xmath26 dwt clusters.thus,as the results of both observed and mock samples showed , there no sz signal can be seen with less bounded systems .",
    "with the cross - correlation between wmap and 2mass , we have detect the sz effect in the 2mass dwt clusters with temperature decrease @xmath61 @xmath48k , while there are no evidence of sz effect in the less bound objects .",
    "this result is consistent with the biased mock sz effected cmb map .",
    "based on these results , we strongly suggests that the hot gas are not traced by galaxy clusters , but more outspread distributed .",
    "as we have known , the galaxies formation and evolution involves a complex dynamical system of separating baryonic gas and dark matter , which is generally characterized by strong shocks .",
    "this feature can be seen with the self - similar solution of spherical collapse under the self - gravity of baryonic gas and dark matter given by bertschinger(1985 ) .",
    "it shows that an outgoing shock is always formed during the infall of baryons .",
    "the shocks outgoing from high - density regions can slow down the infall motion of baryons from low - density to collapsed regions , while dark matter is not affected by the shocks .",
    "thus , it can probably leads to the decoupling between the mass and cosmic hot gas .",
    "our results that the distribution of the baryon fraction is not uniform are consistent with both observations and simulations.the x - ray measurements have revealed that the baryon fraction in galaxy clusters is less than the prediction of primordial nucleosynthesis ( ettori & fabian 1999 ) .",
    "he et al.(2005 )",
    "used the hydro - simulation to study the spatial dependence cosmic baryons distribution under the mechanism of shocks in nonlinear system , they suggested that about 14% baryons in the universe are `` hidden '' around the clusters named warm - hot intergalactic medium(whim ) .    on large scales ,",
    "the non - uniformity of the baryon fraction is a result of the statistical discrepancy of baryonic gas from the underlying galaxy clusters.the baryons can be traced neither by qso absorption spectrum nor by x - ray emissions .",
    "however , the ionized electrons in the outspread baryons would be scatter the cmb photons and contribute to the sz effect as well .",
    "thus , the sz effect detection is a powerful tool to probe the missing of baryon matter in the universe .",
