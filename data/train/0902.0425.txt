    "several theoretical studies have suggested that dynamical interactions among young stars could be important  perhaps even essential  for the formation of brown dwarfs @xcite . in one of the proposed scenarios , the dynamical evolution of a group of protostars leads to the ejection of one of its members from the natal cloud core .",
    "because its accretion is prematurely halted , the ejected object does not grow to become a star .",
    "alternatively , brown dwarfs might form through the fragmentation of circumstellar disks around protostars .",
    "the disruption of these binary systems by interactions with other stars in the surrounding cluster would then produce free - floating brown dwarfs .    according to early versions of the ejection models ,",
    "binary brown dwarfs should have separations that are no larger than @xmath9  au @xcite .",
    "this prediction was consistent with the results from initial multiplicity surveys of brown dwarfs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* references therein ) , but more recent observations have uncovered a small number of wide low - mass binaries in both the field and young clusters . because of their fragile nature , it would seem difficult for a dynamical model to explain the existence of the widest and least massive systems ( @xmath10  au , @xmath11  @xmath4 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "nevertheless , in a new set of simulations , @xcite were able to produce a wide binary brown dwarf through the simultaneous ejection of two brown dwarfs in similar directions , indicating that the ejection models may remain viable .",
    "however , the feasibility of this formation mechanism for wide binaries depends on the environmental conditions of the star - forming cloud , particularly the stellar density .",
    "in fact , because the ejection models require the presence of a stellar cluster , brown dwarfs should not form in isolation , either as singles or binaries , if dynamical interactions are necessary for their formation .",
    "the taurus complex of molecular clouds is the most promising site in which one might find brown dwarfs that have been born in isolation .",
    "taurus is the prototypical example of a low - density star forming region , is well - populated ( @xmath12 known members ) and nearby ( @xmath13  pc ) , and has been surveyed extensively for both stellar and substellar members @xcite . in this paper , we report the discovery of a wide binary brown dwarf in an isolated dark cloud in taurus .",

    "february 23 , the young star ft  tau , which is on the edge of barnard 215 ( see fig .  [",

    "the reduced images of fu  tau  a and b at 3.6 and 8.0  from the 2007 observations are shown in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "we measured aperture aperture photometry for fu  tau  a in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "we applied the same methods to the secondary except that we first removed light from the primary by subtracting a scaled irac point spread function @xcite .",
    "in addition to the irac data , images of fu  tau at 24  have been obtained with the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; * ? ? ?",
    "these observations were performed on 2007 february 2 through d. padgett s _ spitzer _ legacy program and have aor numbers of 19026688 and 19027200 .",

    "the irac and mips measurements for fu  tau are presented in table  [ tab : phot ] .",
    "to investigate the properties of fu  tau  a and b , we begin by using our optical and ir spectra to measure their spectral types and reddenings and to assess their ages .",
    "the optical spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] . both objects exhibit strong tio and vo absorption bands , which are characteristic of late - m spectral types .",
    "the weak na  i , k  i , and feh absorption lines @xcite and , in the case of the primary , triangular @xmath19-band continuum @xcite demonstrate that fu  tau  a and b have the low surface gravities that are found in pre - main - sequence objects .",
    "the h@xmath2 emission in each spectrum is also stronger than that found among field dwarfs @xcite , providing additional evidence of youth .",
    "thus , the spectra confirm that fu  tau  a and b are young , low - mass objects .",
    "we measured spectral types from the optical spectra by comparing them to averages of dwarfs and giants @xcite and previously - classified members of taurus and other star - forming regions @xcite , arriving at m7.25@xmath390.25 and m9.25@xmath390.25 for the primary and secondary , respectively . to illustrate the derivation of these classifications , fu  tau  a and b",
    "are compared to a selection of standards in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "fu  tau  a matches closely with the average of a dwarf and a giant at m7.25 as well as the primary in the young binary 2mass  j11011926@xmath407732383 ( hereafter 2 m  1101@xmath407732 , m7.25 ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , which has an optical spectral type of m6.75 @xcite . meanwhile , fu  tau  b is intermediate between an m9 dwarf / giant average and the taurus member kpno  4 ( m9.5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "when we compare the ir spectrum of fu  tau  a to previous spex data for optically - classified young objects @xcite , we derive an ir spectral type that is consistent with the optical measurement .",
    "the slopes of the optical spectra of fu  tau  a and b are similar to those of our bluest young standards , indicating they have low extinction ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "for instance , the optical spectrum of the primary has the same slope as oph  1622@xmath402405  a from upper sco ( m7.25 ; * ? ? ? * ) , which probably has little reddening since it is not associated with a molecular cloud .",
    "however , the 12.5  spectrum of fu  tau  a is redder than that of oph  1622@xmath402405  a by an amount that is equivalent to @xmath42 @xcite . the same is true when we compare fu  tau  a to other young m7 objects that appear to have negligible extinction , such as mho  4 , kpno  2 , and kpno  5 .",
    "this anomalous difference between the optical and ir reddening estimates for fu  tau  a is probably not caused by errors in the spectra because the 0.61  slopes of the ldss-3 , low - resolution spex data , and medium - resolution spex data are in good agreement while the 12.5  slopes are the same among the two sets of spex data and the colors from 2mass .",
    "it is possible that the ir spectrum appears too red because it is contaminated by long - wavelength emission from circumstellar dust , or the optical spectrum appears too blue because it is contaminated by scattered light or uv emission from accretion . to test the first hypothesis ,",
    "we have compared the @xmath17 @xmath7-band spectrum of fu  tau  a to spex data for field dwarfs near the same spectral type @xcite .",
    "we find no evidence for significant continuum emission from dust , which would cause the lines to appear weaker , or  veiled \" , relative to those of a normal stellar photosphere .",
    "thus , the slope of the ir spectrum of fu  tau  a should accurately reflect its extinction .",
    "the alternative explanation is supported by the analysis of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of fu  tau  a in   [ sec : sed ] , which demonstrates the presence of short - wavelength excess emission .      to examine the masses and ages of the components of fu  tau , we can compare their effective temperatures and bolometric luminosties to the values predicted by theoretical evolutionary models .",
    "we have converted the spectral types of fu  tau  a and b to effective temperatures with the temperature scale from @xcite . to estimate the luminosity of the primary , we have combined its @xmath18-band magnitude with the average bolometric correction for dwarfs near its spectral type @xcite , an extinction of @xmath42 (   [ sec : class ] ) , and a distance of 140  pc @xcite . for the secondary",
    ", we use its @xmath7-band magnitude since a reliable @xmath18 measurement is not available . by doing so",
    ", we are assuming that any circumstellar disk that might reside around fu  tau  b produces negligible emission at @xmath7 compared to the stellar photosphere .",
    "this assumption is likely to be valid since disks around brown dwarfs rarely exhibit significant @xmath7-band excess emission @xcite .",
    "the resulting temperatures and luminosities are listed in table  [ tab : prop ] .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath43 , near - ir magnitudes , and bolometric corrections ( @xmath44 , 0.02 , 0.1 ) correspond to errors of @xmath45 in the relative values of log  @xmath46 .",
    "when an uncertainty in the distance modulus is included ( @xmath47 ) , the total uncertainties are @xmath48 .",
    "these uncertainties do not include variability , which is known to be significant for the primary ( table  [ tab : phot ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "our temperature and luminosity estimates for fu  tau  a and b are plotted on the h - r diagram in figure  [ fig : hr ] with the evolutionary models from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although the components of binary systems are expected to be coeval , fu  tau  a and b do not appear near the same model isochrone .",
    "the models imply an age of 1 myr for the secondary while the primary is overluminous by an order of magnitude relative to that isochrone . the discrepancy is reduced somewhat if fu  tau  a and b are compared to a fit to the cluster sequence for chamaeleon  i @xcite , which acts as an empirical isochrone .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : hr ] , the primary and secondary appear 1.3 and 0.6  dex above this fit , respectively , resulting in a luminosity ratio that is 0.7  dex larger than expected for a coeval pair .",
    "fu  tau  a is much brighter than other members of taurus with similar spectral types whereas fu  tau  b falls within the cluster sequence @xcite , indicating that the difference in isochronal ages for the pair is a reflection of an anomalously high luminosity for the primary rather than a low luminosity for the secondary .",
    "one possible explanation is that fu  tau  a is an unresolved binary .",
    "if so , it would appear near the upper envelope of the cluster sequence for taurus in the h - r diagram , although it would remain overluminous relative to fu  tau  b by @xmath49  dex .",
    "the data and models in figure  [ fig : hr ] imply a mass of @xmath50  @xmath4 for fu  tau  b. the model predictions do not encompass the temperature and luminosity of fu  tau  a , and thus do not provide a direct estimate of its mass . however , because of the vertical nature of the mass tracks of low - mass stars and brown dwarfs at young ages ( @xmath51  myr ) , the spectral type of fu  tau  a should provide a good indication of its mass regardless of luminosity . as shown in figure  [ fig : hr ] , the spectral type of fu  tau  a combined with the adopted temperature scale and models imply a mass of @xmath52  @xmath4 .",
    "this estimate is consistent with the fact that fu  tau  a is slightly cooler than 2 m  0535@xmath400546 ( figure  [ fig : spec ] ) , whose components have dynamical masses of 0.054 and 0.034  @xmath4 @xcite    to compare the masses and ages of fu  tau  a and b to those of previously known young low - mass binaries , we have included the components of 2 m  j1101@xmath407732 , oph  1622@xmath402405 , and usco  ctio  108 in figure",
    "[ fig : hr ] . because the optical spectra of these systems and fu  tau have been directly compared ( figure  [ fig : spec ] ;",

    "* ) , their relative spectral types should be quite accurate .",
    "in addition , the spectral types and photometry have been converted to temperatures and luminosities with the same methods that we have applied to fu  tau .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : hr ] , fu  tau  a probably has a mass that is similar to those of the other three primaries",
    "while fu  tau  b may be slightly less massive than oph  1622@xmath402405  b and usco  ctio  108  b. the most striking aspect of this comparison is that the luminosity ratio of fu  tau  a and b ( @xmath53 ) is much larger than the ratios in the other systems ( @xmath5416 ) , further illustrating that one of the components of fu  tau ( probably the primary ) has an anomalous luminosity .",
    "we selected fu  tau  a as a candidate member of taurus because it exhibits mid - ir colors that are indicative of a circumstellar disk . to demonstrate the presence of this mid - ir excess emission from fu  tau  a and to determine whether its companion has a disk ,",
    "we have constructed their seds using the photometry compiled in table  [ tab : phot ] .",
    "sdss and irac have provided photometry at multiple epochs for the fu  tau system ; we adopt the average of the available measurements for a given sdss band and we use the irac data from 2007 since the camera observed fu  tau in only two bands in the other epoch .",
    "in addition to the photometry , we include in the sed for fu  tau  a the low - resolution ir spectrum obtained with spex , which has been flux - calibrated with the photometry from 2mass .",
    "the resulting seds of fu  tau  a and b are presented in figure  [ fig : sed ] .    to determine if the seds contain excess emission at short or long wavelengths , we compare them to the seds of stellar photospheres .",
    "we construct an estimate of the photospheric seds of fu  tau  a and b from data for the taurus members kpno  5 and kpno  4 , respectively , which have similar spectral types as fu  tau  a and b , have negligible extinction , and lack mid - ir excess emission and significant accretion @xcite . optical measurements in the sdss and @xmath30 bands for the kpno objects are taken from @xcite and @xcite . because kpno 4 has a very low signal - to - noise ratio at @xmath24 , we compute the flux in this band by combining the @xmath25 photometry for kpno  4 with the typical value of @xmath55 for m9 dwarfs @xcite . for kpno  5 , we include a low - resolution ir spectrum collected with spex @xcite .",
    "for the mid - ir portion of these photospheric seds , we adopt the average colors of diskless stars near the spectral types of fu  tau  a and b @xcite .",
    "the template for fu  tau  a is reddened by @xmath42 according to the reddening laws from @xcite and @xcite . the photospheric seds are then normalized to the @xmath18- and @xmath7-band fluxes of fu  tau  a and b , respectively . relative to these seds , both fu  tau  a and b exhibit significant excess emission at wavelengths longward of 4  , as shown in figure  [ fig : sed ] .",
    "the primary also has excess emission in the bluest optical and uv bands , which probably explains why its optical spectrum implies less extinction than the near - ir data (   [ sec : class ] ) .",
    "to classify the seds of fu  tau  a and b according to the standard scheme for young stars @xcite , we use the ir spectral slope that is defined as @xmath56  log@xmath57  log@xmath58 @xcite . the extinction - corrected slopes between 3.6 and 8  for each object",

    "we adopt our measurement of the proper motion in the following discussion .    what is the proper motion of a hypothetical member of taurus at the position of fu  tau  a ?",
    "because taurus covers a large solid angle of sky , the proper motion for a given velocity vector varies across the association due to geometric projection effects . for this calculation",

    "the predicted motion is also within 1.1  @xmath66 and 2.4  @xmath66 of the usno - b1.0 @xmath64 and @xmath65 motions , respectively . for comparison , in table [ tab : pm ]",
    "we also include the predicted proper motions for hypothetical members of the hyades and pleiades open clusters at their respective mean distances , which are based on data from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "both groups are known to have members in the vicinity of taurus .",
    "however , the motion of fu  tau  a is completely inconsistent with the kinematic membership of either of these clusters . based on this analysis",
    ", we conclude that the proper motion of fu  tau  a is in good agreement with the average motion of the stellar population in taurus . according to the astrometric measurements of fu  tau  a and b in table  [ tab : astro ]",
    ", the pair maintained the same relative positions to within @xmath67 across a period of three years , indicating that the secondary shares the same motion as the primary at a level of @xmath330  mas  yr@xmath60 .",
    "it is useful to compare the motion of fu  tau  a to that of ft  tau , which is the only other known young star that is projected against the barnard 215 cloud ( figure  [ fig : sdss ] ) .",
    "we have measured the proper motion of ft  tau using the same catalogs that were employed for fu  tau  a , arriving at values of @xmath68  mas  yr@xmath60 and @xmath69  mas  yr@xmath60 .",
    "the motions of the two objects agree to within 1.1@xmath394.9 and 2.2@xmath394.7  mas  yr@xmath60 in right ascension and declination , respectively , which translates into tangential velocities at 140  pc that agree to within 0.7@xmath393.3 and 1.5@xmath393.1  km  s@xmath60 .",
    "these relative motions indicate that fu  tau  a has remained within a projected distance of 1.7  pc ( @xmath70 ) from ft  tau during its lifetime ( @xmath71  myr , figure  [ fig : hr ] ) .",
    "the agreement in their velocities and the presence of nebulosity centered on each source strongly suggests that they are associated with the barnard 215 cloud and were not born elsewhere .    finally , we have searched for evidence of additional young stars near barnard 215 . aside from fu  tau and ft  tau , the only other candidate young star that has been previously identified near the cloud is gt  tau @xcite . through an analysis similar to that performed for fu  tau and ft  tau , we find that the proper motion of gt  tau is inconsistent with membership in taurus .",
    "previous surveys for young stars in the vicinity of barnard 215 have been conducted at optical wavelengths , and thus could have missed stars that are embedded within the cloud .",
    "the mid - ir images from _ spitzer _ that were used to uncover fu  tau easily penetrate the extinction of barnard 215 , and they do not reveal any additional disk - bearing stars .",
    "we can not rule out the presence of diskless young stars within the cloud given that they would be indistinguishable from field stars in _ spitzer _ data .",
    "however , it is unlikely that an embedded population within the cloud would consist of only diskless stars .",
    "we have presented strong evidence indicating that fu  tau  a and b are members of the taurus star - forming region .",
    "we have also shown that they have similar proper motions , but the accuracy of these measurements is insufficient to distinguish between a binary system and a pair of unrelated members of taurus that are seen in projection near each other . therefore , as in most studies of visual pairs in star - forming regions , we rely on a statistical analysis to assess whether fu  tau  a and b are likely to comprise a binary system . because of the low stellar density in taurus , it is unlikely that a given member of the region will appear close to another member on the sky , unless they are in a binary system .",
    "this probability is particularly low for fu  tau , which resides in one of the most isolated dark clouds in taurus .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : map ] , only one young star has been found within a radius of @xmath72 surrounding fu  tau .",
    "we can roughly quantify the probability that fu  tau is a pair of unrelated low - mass taurus members . among the 51 known members of taurus that have spectral types later than m6 , the median distance to the nearest @xmath73m6 neighbor is @xmath74 . for our probability calculation ,",
    "we adopt a population of 51 objects that are randomly distributed across an area of 32.5  deg@xmath75 , which exhibits a median nearest neighbor distance that is similar to the observed value .",
    "the probability of finding a pair of objects in this population with a projected separation of @xmath6 is @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , it is likely that fu  tau  a and b comprise a binary system .",
    "with component masses of @xmath30.05 and @xmath30.015  @xmath4 and a projected separation of 800  au , fu  tau joins the growing sample of wide low - mass binaries that have been discovered in recent years (   [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "these systems have provided valuable constraints on theories of the formation of brown dwarfs @xcite . unlike the previously known binaries  or free - floating brown dwarfs , for that matter  fu  tau  a and b are the first spectroscopically - confirmed brown dwarfs discovered forming in isolation .",
    "the unique formation environment of fu  tau represents a new test of theoretical models for the origin of brown dwarfs .    as reviewed in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , dynamical models typically create brown dwarfs through ejection from protostellar clusters @xcite or fragmentation of disks around stars and subsequent stripping of the substellar companion through encounters with other stars @xcite . because both mechanisms require the presence of stellar clusters , they can not account for the existence of brown dwarfs like fu  tau  a and b that are forming in isolation .",
    "although the disk fragmentation models produce brown dwarfs as companions to stars , and those stars can be isolated , this scenario is not plausible for fu  tau because the mass and separation of the secondary are much larger than the ( limited ) measurements of masses and radii for brown dwarf disks ( @xmath77  au , @xmath78  @xmath79 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the discovery of fu  tau demonstrates that brown dwarfs can arise in isolation without the involvement of dynamical interactions among stars .",
    "it is likely that the same process that made it possible for substellar objects to form in barnard 215 also occurs in clusters as well .",
    "thus , it is unnecessary to invoke additional mechanisms like ejection for creating brown dwarfs unless observations indicate their presence .",
    "dynamical interactions in young clusters probably do affect the formation of brown dwarfs , just as they affect the formation of stars , but there is no evidence to date that they represent a second dominant mechanism that enables the birth of brown dwarfs @xcite .",

    "<S> during a survey for stars with disks in the taurus star - forming region using the _ spitzer space telescope _ , we have discovered a pair of young brown dwarfs , fu  tau  a and b , in the barnard 215 dark cloud . </S>",
    "<S> they have a projected angular separation of @xmath0 , corresponding to 800  au at the distance of taurus . to assess the nature of these two objects , we have obtained spectra of them and have constructed their spectral energy distributions . </S>",
    "<S> both sources are young ( @xmath1  myr ) according to their h@xmath2 emission , gravity - sensitive spectral features , and mid - ir excess emission . the proper motion of fu  tau  a provides additional evidence of its membership in taurus . </S>",
    "<S> we measure spectral types of m7.25 and m9.25 for fu  tau  a and b , respectively , which correspond to masses of @xmath30.05 and @xmath30.015  @xmath4 according to the evolutionary models of chabrier and baraffe . </S>",
    "<S> fu  tau  a is significantly overluminous relative to an isochrone passing through fu  tau  b and relative to other members of taurus near its spectral type , which may indicate that it is an unresolved binary . </S>",
    "<S> fu  tau  a and b are likely to be components of a binary system based on the low probability ( @xmath5 ) that taurus would produce two unrelated brown dwarfs with a projected separation of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> barnard 215 contains only one other young star and is in a remote area of taurus , making fu  tau  a and b the first spectroscopically - confirmed brown dwarfs discovered forming in isolation rather than in a stellar cluster or aggregate . </S>",
    "<S> because they were born in isolation and comprise a weakly bound binary , dynamical interactions with stars could not have played a role in their formation , and thus are not essential for the birth of brown dwarfs .    </S>",
    "<S> * erratum : * the @xmath7-band magnitude for fu  tau  b in table  1 is incorrect and should be 13.33 . </S>",
    "<S> the bolometric luminosity of fu  tau  b in table 3 and figure 5 is incorrect because of that mistake and a separate arithmetic error . </S>",
    "<S> the correct value of the luminosity is 0.0039  @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> fu  tau  a and b exhibited different isochronal ages in the original hertzsprung - russell diagram in figure  5 , which was unexpected for members of a binary system . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy is reduced in the corrected version of figure  5 since both objects are now above the isochrone for 1  myr . </S>",
    "<S> given the large uncertainties in model isochrones at such young ages , the positions of fu  tau  a and b in figure  5 could be roughly consistent with coevality . </S>"
