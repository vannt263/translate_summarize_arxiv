    "little is known about the distribution of the galaxies .",
    "determining the properties of these galaxies is very important in order to assess the physical reality and extension of the structure and to determine if galaxies and clusters trace the matter distribution in the same way .",
    "with the use of the optopus and mefos multifibre spectrographs at the 3.6 m eso telescope we performed a redshift survey of galaxies in the two cluster complexes ( dominated by a3528 and a3558 ; bardelli et al .",

    "we show the observing strategy for the inter  cluster galaxies survey in plates 443 and 444 , while in fig.2 we report the wedge diagrams of the galaxy distribution . in the upper panel of fig.2 , it is clear the presence of the two cluster complexes dominated by a3558 ( on the left ) and by a3528 ( on the right ) .",
    "these two structures appear to be connected by a bridge of galaxies , resembling the coma - a1367 system in the central part of the great wall .",
    "the scale of this system is @xmath7 h@xmath5 mpc and it is similar to that of coma - a1367 ( @xmath8 h@xmath5 mpc ) .",
    "note also the presence of two voids at @xmath9 km / s and @xmath1 km / s in the easternmost half of the wedge .",
    "other two voids are visible in the westernmost part of the sample , delimiting two filamentary structures at @xmath1 km / s and @xmath10 km / s , which connect each other at right ascension of @xmath11 .    knowing the incompleteness of the sample and using the luminosity function of field galaxies ( from the esp survey , zucca et al .",

    "note however that in this plot the shapley concentration is not fully represented , lacking the large contribution of cluster galaxies .",
    "the same analysis has been done for the cluster complexes surveys and then the total density excess has been calculated .",
