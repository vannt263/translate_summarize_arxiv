    "the group @xmath0 was already mentioned in the first papers on @xmath2 supergravity  @xcite .",
    "this algebra and its extension @xmath11 appeared as anti - de sitter ( ads ) and superconformal algebras in @xmath1 and @xmath2 minkowski theories  @xcite long ago , and got new attention related to the @xmath12-theory algebra  @xcite . the ads or conformal",
    "algebras got new attention in a recent paper on the superconformal aspects of @xmath2 theories @xcite and in two - time theories @xcite . in these two cases ,",
    "the @xmath11 conformal group appeared . in the physical theories that we consider , we need the subgroup of @xmath11 that is a contraction of @xmath0 in a way that will be clarified below .",
    "our initial motivation to study the role of the @xmath0 algebra was related to euclidean theories .",
    "when one considers the @xmath13-instanton @xcite , one often considers the bosonic theory , ignoring its possible embedding in the supersymmetric theory .",
    "in particular , one makes use of the iib theory in euclidean space , while the latter can not be formulated as a supersymmetric theory with real fields , as we will show below .",
    "remark that the connection between these euclidean theories and the minkowski string theories involve a duality between theories of different spacetime signature @xcite .",
    "a second question that was posed when we started this research , was related to the observation that in many super - euclidean theories one makes use of complexification of the fields and in other cases one does not @xcite .",
    "we would like to know when it is necessary to do so , and when it can be avoided .",
    "apart from the possibility of no time directions , one is also interested in theories with more time directions @xcite .",
    "therefore , it looked natural to extend our investigation to an arbitrary spacetime signature .",
    "this leads to a web of dualities between theories in @xmath1 , 11 and 12 of different spacetime signature , similar to what has been found in @xcite .",
    "we obtain these dualities from an algebraic approach , which puts the contraction of @xmath0 as a unifying principle .",
    "the different theories are then just many faces of the same underlying symmetry group .",
    "this seminar summarizes the results obtained in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we clarify the relation between the super - poincar algebra that we consider here , and the full @xmath0 as super - ads algebra or @xmath11 as superconformal algebra .",
    "our results are divided in 3 main parts . in section  [ ss : complexalgebras ]",
    "we consider the complex algebra and its realizations in the different dimensions , in section  [ ss : realalgebras ] we consider the real algebra and its realizations in different spacetime signatures , and in section  [ ss : translationenergy ] we identify the translation operator , distinguishing between different lagrangian theories for the same spacetime signature . throughout the work we indicate the dualities connecting all the theories .",
    "finally , a short summary is given in section  [ ss : conclusions ] .",
    "@xmath0 is the algebra of 32 fermionic charges with all possible bosonic generators in their anticommutator .",
    "we recapitulate its definition , with the bosonic generators defining @xmath14",
    ". then we will see how the contraction , explained in more detail in @xcite , underlies the f - theory of 12 dimensions , the m - theory of 11 dimensions , and the iia and iib string theories in 10 dimensions .",
    "they are obtained by identifying appropriate subgroups of @xmath14 as the lorentz rotations .",
    "note that in the case of the extended algebras mentioned in @xcite , this @xmath14 is the automorphism algebra of the supersymmetries , in the semi - direct product with @xmath0 . in any case",
    ", the supersymmetries should be in a spinor representation of the lorentz group .",
    "dimensional reduction and t - dualities are then obtained as mappings between generators of @xmath0 .    the algebra @xmath0 is given by @xmath15= { q_{(a}}\\omega_{b)c}\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ & &   \\left [ { z_{ab}},{z_{cd}}\\right ] = \\omega_{a(c}{z_{d)b}}+ \\omega_{b(c}{z_{d)a}}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 runs over 32 values , @xmath17 is symmetric and has thus @xmath18 components .",
    "@xmath19 is an antisymmetric invertible metric , and as such , the last commutator defines @xmath14 .    to recognize this algebra as a symmetry algebra in @xmath20 dimensions , one has to embed @xmath21 in @xmath14 , in such a way that the spinor representation of @xmath21 fits in the 32",
    "this makes already clear that @xmath3 is the highest possible dimension . to make that identification",
    ", we have to select chiral spinors @xmath22 of 12 dimensions .",
    "these are defined using the chiral projection @xmath23 : @xmath24 remark that we use the notation @xmath25 ( the hat specifies the 12-dimensional context ) in any even dimension to denote the product of all the gamma matrices , similar to @xmath26 in 4 dimensions",
    ". then the algebra ( [ commmq ] ) is realized by identifying @xmath19 with @xmath27 , the ( antisymmetric ) charge conjugation matrix of @xmath3 .",
    "splitting the matrix @xmath17 in its irreducible representations , the anticommutator of the supersymmetries looks like @xmath28    \\frac12 .32.33 & = & { { \\textstyle\\frac{1}{2 } } } .12.11 & + & \\frac12\\,\\ ,    \\frac{12.11.10.9.8.7}{1.2.3.4.5.6}\\ , , \\end{array}\\label{algd12}\\ ] ] where the last line shows that indeed all 528 generators are present , and the right - hand side thus contains everything which is consistent from the symmetry property of an anticommutator .    in 11 dimensions , the bosonic generators split as @xmath29 , following the anticommutator @xmath30 in 10 dimensions one can again define chiral spinors , which are 16-dimensional , and consider either 2 generators of opposite chirality ( iia ) or of the same chirality ( iib ) . in the first case",
    ", the anticommutators are @xmath31 the 528 generators are thus split as @xmath32 in the anticommutators between generators of the same chirality and @xmath33 in the anticommutator between generators of opposite chirality .    for the iib case",
    ", we have a doublet of fermionic generators @xmath34 , @xmath35 , of the same chirality , and the anticommutators are @xmath36 where in the second line we have split the symmetric matrix @xmath37 in three components , as we can also do for the 5-index generators .",
    "the decomposition is here @xmath38 .",
    "it is clear that all these algebras are related .",
    "the dimensional reductions relate the generators as follows . the chiral generator @xmath39 of 12 dimensions , splits in 10 dimensions in a chiral and an antichiral generator , as follows from the relation @xmath40 for a convenient realization of gamma matrices , where @xmath25 is the product of 10 gamma matrices of dimension @xmath41 in 10 dimensions ( for the realization that we use in any dimension see @xcite ) .",
    "the two chiral generators are the @xmath42 in ( [ calgiia ] ) , and adding them gives the 32-component generator @xmath43 used for @xmath2 .",
    "the t - dual theories are identified by taking @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a gamma matrix in an arbitrary ( spacelike or timelike ) direction . on the other hand ,",
    "s - duality is the mapping @xmath46 thus all the dimensional reductions and dualities are written as mappings between the generators of @xmath0 .",
    "we mentioned here only the fermionic generators explicitly , as the rules for the bosonic generators follow from identifying the anticommutator relations before and after the map .",
    "e.g. when going from 12 to 11 dimensions , this leads to the identifications @xmath47 note that the appearance of factors @xmath48 is irrelevant here , as we can make redefinitions of generators involving @xmath48 at random . for the real algebras , to be discussed below",
    ", this should be possible consistently with the reality conditions , as we checked in @xcite .",
    "the important fact for the real forms is the uniqueness of the real form of the superalgebra @xmath0",
    ". therefore the equivalences of all the symmetry algebras of section  [ ss : complexalgebras ] are valid also for the real form , when it exists .",
    "the real form exists only for specific spacetime signatures .",
    "the dimensional reduction and t - duality acts now between theories of specific signatures .",
    "we have to distinguish then space / space , time / time and space / time dualities .",
    "considering the table of real forms of the basic lie superalgebras ( see e.g. table  5 of @xcite for a convenient presentation ) , we see that nearly all superalgebras have different real forms , even the exceptional superalgebras .",
    "but the algebras @xmath49 have only one real form , with @xmath50 as bosonic subalgebra .",
    "to realize this real algebra in @xmath20 dimensions , we have to consider when we can impose consistent reality conditions on the fermionic generators .",
    "this is sufficient to be able to classify all the realizations of the unique real superalgebra @xmath0 .",
    "table  2 of @xcite gives the summary of the results that we need .",
    "we need 32 real supercharges .",
    "the table shows that @xmath3 with @xmath51 signature @xmath52 is the highest possible dimension . in general the results",
    "are invariant under @xmath53 , thus @xmath54 is also possible .",
    "the interchange of @xmath55 and @xmath56 is irrelevant , and corresponds merely to a change of notations of mostly @xmath57 to mostly @xmath58 metrics .",
    "therefore we do not mention the @xmath59 signature . to make the projections to real spinors",
    "one uses three types of projections , weyl , majorana or symplectic majorana : @xmath60 the first one is the weyl projection to chiral spinors that we already encountered in ( [ chirald12 ] ) .",
    "the other two are reality conditions .",
    "@xmath61 is a definite matrix in spinor space , which is defined here using the charge conjugation matrix @xmath62 , and all the timelike @xmath63-matrices . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath64 is a scalar in the spinor space , but may be a matrix acting on the different generators @xmath65 , e.g. between @xmath66 and @xmath67 in type  iia , or between @xmath68 and @xmath69 in type  iib . in the cases where the table indicates ` m ' , @xmath70 and a consistent reality condition can be obtained with @xmath71 . therefore in these cases ,",
    "a single spinor can suffice , and these are the so - called majorana spinors . in other cases",
    "@xmath72 , consistency ( taking the @xmath5 of a @xmath5 is an identity ) also @xmath73 .",
    "therefore in these cases we need a matrix @xmath64 of even dimension .",
    "we thus have a doubling of the generators , and this is the so - called symplectic majorana condition .",
    "this leads to the possibilities for 32-component real spinors , listed in table  [ tbl : mwsspinors ] .",
    "._the possible spacetime signatures for 32 real spinor generators .",
    "the first column indicates the number of complex generators that are present before any projection .",
    "the last row indicates , for each signature , whether in @xmath1 a real form for type  iia ( a ) , type  iib ( b ) or both ( a / b ) exists . _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     one can then consider the dimensional reductions and t - dualities discussed in section  [ ss : complexalgebras ] , but now we have to be careful with the signatures . when performing the t - duality as in ( [ qtdual ] )",
    ", one has to distinguish whether @xmath45 is a timelike or a spacelike gamma matrix .",
    "this @xmath55-direction can even be timelike for the iia algebra and spacelike for the iib algebra or vice  versa .",
    "these are the time / space or space / time t - dualities , changing the signature .",
    "this leads to the both - sided arrows in figure  [ ff : small ] .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that all these identifications of algebras require mappings between the @xmath64 factors in ( [ mws ] ) for the different realizations . at the end , these are all redefinitions of the generators .",
    "the reality conditions on the fermionic generators lead to reality conditions on the bosonic generators in order that the anticommutation relations are consistent . the dimensional reduction and",
    "t - dualities give mappings that relate real bosonic generators in one algebra with real bosonic generators in the other algebra .",
    "this is highly nontrivial , but it is bound to work out , due to the uniqueness of the real form of @xmath0 .",

    "in the third step we identify one of the vector generators as ` translations ' .",
    "this identification is essential for a spacetime interpretation of the theory .",
    "the different possibilities for this identification distinguish e.g. iia from iia@xmath75 theories .",
    "we will then remark that t - duality gives a mapping between different types of generators .",
    "it can mix e.g. translations with ` central charges ' .",
    "finally , we will see that there is a unique positive energy operator in the algebra .",
    "however , that generator is not always the timelike component of the translations .",
    "for instance , in iia theories , the positive operator is @xmath6 , but in iia@xmath75 theories it is another one , and thus @xmath6 is not positive in that case .",
    "so far , all bosonic generators were treated on equal footing . to make the connection between algebras and a spacetime theory , we want to know which generator performs ` translations ' in spacetime .",
    "seen in another way , spacetime is the manifold defined from a base point by the action of this ` translation ' generator .",
    "this is thus similar to the coset space idea . to generate a spacetime of the appropriate dimension",
    ", the translation operator should be a vector operator in the theory .",
    "this is nearly the only requirement , apart from a non - degeneracy condition . indeed , in order that the supersymmetries perform their usual role , they should square to the translations .",
    "thus the matrix that appears in the anticommutator between all the supersymmetries , defining how they square to translations , should be non - degenerate .    for @xmath3 , with the algebra ( [ algd12 ] )",
    ", there is no vector operator .",
    "thus there is no candidate for translations , implying that f - theory has no straightforward spacetime interpretation . on the other hand , for @xmath2 , with the algebra ( [ qqd11 ] )",
    ", there is one vector operator , and this one should thus be called the translation generator .    in 10 dimensions",
    "it becomes more interesting .",
    "consider first the iia algebra ( [ calgiia ] ) .",
    "there are 2 vector operators @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "both separately are not convenient , because then one half of the supersymmetries would not square to translations .",
    "but we can take linear combinations .",
    "for the signature @xmath78 there are , up to redefinitions , two choices consistent with the reality conditions @xmath79 we label these choices as iia and iia@xmath75 in accordance with @xcite . for signatures",
    "@xmath52 or @xmath80 there are the possibilities @xmath81 however , now these two choices can be related by a redefinition @xmath82 .",
    "such a redefinition is , similar to ( [ qsdual ] ) and therefore we recognize it as an s - duality .",
    "the operators that are not translations , remain as ` central charges ' in the theory .",
    "therefore we see that the generator that is a translation in one theory , appears as a central charge in the other theory , as we announced in the beginning of this section .    for the iib algebra ( [ calgiib ] ) , there are three candidates for translations . for signature ( 9,1 )",
    "they are all consistent with the reality condition .",
    "we thus distinguish @xmath83 considering the possible redefinitions , we come back to ( [ qsdual ] ) .",
    "this s - duality leaves the iia translation generator invariant , and relates the translation of iib@xmath75 with that of @xmath84 . on the other hand , for the signature ( 7,3 )",
    "there are three s - dual versions .",
    "we present the results schematically in figure  [ fig : detaildrdual ] .",
    "it is a detail of a part of figure  [ ff : small ] .",
    "the specification of the translation generator distinguishes different iia and iib theories .",
    "the t - dualities connect specific versions .",
    "s - dual theories are mapped by t - dualities to s - dual theories .    finally , we can identify one bosonic operator in @xmath0 that is positive .",
    "we can identify this one from the anticommutation relation @xmath85 using the majorana condition and , to argue for the positivity , we use the convention that complex conjugation does not change the order of the operators .",
    "see @xcite for the arguments independent of these conventions ] in ( [ mws ] ) .",
    "we denote @xmath86 to represent all the anticommutation relations , where @xmath87 is a matrix in spinor space as well as in the @xmath88 indices . for convenience",
    "we write here the charge conjugation matrix explicit . using the expression of @xmath61 in ( [ mws ] ) , this implies @xmath89 therefore , the trace of that operator has positive eigenvalues .",
    "when we split @xmath90 as usual in different irreducible representations for the spacetime lorentz group , then , in order to absorb the gamma matrices , the relevant part of @xmath90 has as many spacetime indices as there are time directions .",
    "all its directions should be timelike .",
    "thus for minkowski spaces it is the timelike component of a vector operator , while for euclidean theories this positive operator is a scalar ` central charge ' . for minkowski theories we can thus wonder whether the positive energy operator is the timelike component of the operator that we selected as ` translations ' .",
    "if this is the case then the usual hamiltonian will be positive .",
    "when the positive energy is the timelike component of another vector operator , then the hamiltonian built from @xmath6 is not positive definite .",
    "this is what happens in the iia@xmath75 , iib@xmath75 and iib@xmath91 theories . in these theories ,",
    "the kinetic energies of some of the @xmath92-form gauge fields are negative definite .",
    "as an example consider the vector operators in the iib - like theories , as in ( [ calgiib ] ) . with our convention that @xmath93 , the trace in ( [ zpos ] ) selects the @xmath94 component of @xmath95 as the positive definite energy .",
    "thus it is indeed the iib theory where the energy is the timelike part of translations , and not for the other versions .",
    "the algebraic approach thus gives an understanding of the positivity in type iia and iib versus lack of positivity in the other theories .",
    "the algebras of f - theory , m - theory , type iia and iib , ... are different faces of the same superalgebra @xmath0 .",
    "the uniqueness of the real form of that algebra implies that all these manifestations can be related by mappings between the generators of the algebra . that holds especially for the dimensional reductions , t- and s - dualities that relate these theories .",
    "different spacetime signatures are easily incorporated . however , for certain spacetime signatures , some theories may exist only in complex form .",
    "that answers the questions about why we need sometimes a complexification procedure to obtain an euclidean theory .",
    "in particular , the iib theory has no real form in ( 10,0 ) .",
    "therefore , in order to discuss the d - instanton in iib , we have to give up the concept of a theory with real fields and action .",
    "we have understood the * -theories as being distinguished from the usual iia and iib by a different identification of the translation generator .",
    "they are related to the ordinary theories by a ` duality ' interchanging translations with central charges .",
    "thus in these dualities the concept of spacetime is very intriguing .",
    "it should be interchanged with a sort of harmonic space where coordinates are associated also with other ( vector ) central charges .",
    "the unique positive energy operator is the timelike component of the translations in the ordinary type iia and iib theories , but in other versions ( * -theories or theories with a different signature ) , it is not the @xmath6 operator that is positive , but rather a component of a central charge operator .      we have enjoyed a very stimulating atmosphere at the memorial conference for prof .",
