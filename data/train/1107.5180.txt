    "lagrangian transport methods are based on following the individual trajectories obtained by solving the original differential equation ( ode ) for the particle location starting from a set of initial conditions @xmath0 at time @xmath1 :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the velocity field .",
    "the geometrical approach of dynamical systems theory is particularly useful when the flow field has lagrangian coherent structures that separate the flow into distinct regions .",
    "then lagrangian lobe dynamics describes the transport process between these regions using stable and unstable manifolds of hyperbolic trajectories as ( moving ) boundaries .",
    "the lagrangian methods have been applied successfully to a number of unsteady geophysical flow problems ; for a review , see @xcite .",
    "if the flow is steady , i.e. , @xmath4 , the invariant manifolds are stationary and no transport occurs between the regions .    on the contrary , eulerian - based methods are mainly concerned with the amount of transport across stationary ( eulerian ) boundaries without computing individual trajectories .",
    "an advantage of eulerian methods is that they tend to be much less elaborate than lagrangian methods in terms of computational implementation .",
    "the choice for the eulerian boundaries is generally flexible , unlike the lagrangian methods .    from the dynamical systems point of view ,",
    "a parallel development of a method that computes transport across the eulerian boundary has yet to take place . in this paper",
    "we begin the development of such a method .",
    "the method makes use of the interaction between the reference ( mean ) state and the unsteady variability ( eddy ) as the fundamental mechanism of transport .",
    "hence we refer to it as the * t*ransport * i*nduced by the * m*ean-*e*ddy interaction ( time ) . using a streamline of the reference state as the boundary across which we consider transport , time",
    "can be thought as a hybrid of lagrangian and eulerian methods . like the eulerian method ,",
    "the boundary is stationary . like the lagrangian method ,",
    "the boundary is kinematically defined and there is no time in the steady flow without the unsteady eddy component in the velocity . in certain situations we are able to describe the geometrical relationship of time along the eulerian boundaries with lagrangian lobe dynamics .",
    "we require no assumption of incompressibility in our theoretical framework .",
    "therefore the ideas and techniques of the time method can be applied to two - dimensional compressible flow or three - dimensional volume - preserving flow which can be represented as special classes of two - dimensional flows , such as the shallow - water model .",
    "remarks concerning incompressibility are provided throughout the paper as special cases .",
    "extensions to three - dimensional flow are possible @xcite , but there is more complexity in the geometry of the transport , and this is will be the topic of a future publication .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "bg ] , we provide a brief mathematical background and introduce the notion of a kinematically - defined eulerian boundary ; readers who are familiar with elementary dynamical systems theory may omit this section without significant loss of continuity by referring back to the notation and definitions as necessary . a brief glossary is also provided in table  [ tbl : glssry ] . the time method is defined in section  [ sec : fnc ] , along with the two types of time functions .",
    "these functions , along with the notion of pseudo - lobes , are further explored in section  [ sec : chr ] .",
    "an application of the time method is carried out in section  [ sec : application ] for the inter - gyre transport in the double - gyre ocean circulation model and a comparison with lagrangian transport theory is presented .",
    "appendix  [ sec : p ] provides details of perturbation theory , and appendix  [ sec : l ] compares the time method with the lagrangian transport methods .",
    "while in this paper we focus on introducing and developing the two time functions that estimate the amount and the geometry of transport , in the companion paper @xcite , we expand the time method further as a diagnostic tool for transport processes by analyzing in detail the influence of the mean - eddy interaction .",
    "in this section , we introduce the basic mathematical background necessary to develop the time method .",
    "the starting point is first expressing the velocity field ( [ eq : dxpdt ] ) in the following form :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , correspond to the steady reference state and the unsteady fluctuation around the reference state .",
    "the choice of reference state may not be unique .",
    "we choose the time - average ( mean ) of the full time - dependent field as the reference state in this study because the mean - eddy decomposition is natural when the flow field is given by a data set ; the time method itself does not require the reference state to be the mean .",
    "many of our results will be perturbative in nature , with the ( small ) perturbation parameter being the amplitude of the fluctuation that is implicitly included in @xmath8 with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "appendix  [ sec : pert_just ] gives results on the length of time intervals on which perturbed trajectories remain close to trajectories of the reference state .",
    "these results will provide the validity of the perturbative nature of our method since the time functions that we derive will be of the form of integrals along perturbed trajectories and approximations that , in principle , can be analytically computed are of the form of integrals along trajectories of the reference state .",
    "the regularity assumptions required on the velocity field are minimal .",
    "essentially , we need existence and uniqueness of fluid particle trajectories , the ability to linearize about points in space , compute taylor expansions through second order with respect to parameters , and for certain integrals of components of the velocity field along trajectories of the reference velocity field to exist . assuming that the velocity field is twice continuously differentiable with respect to the spatial coordinates , time , and any parameters is adequate .",
    "no further assumptions on the nature of the time dependence ( e.g. time periodicity , quasiperiodicity , etc . ) are required .",
    "the use of perturbation theory in the development of the time method is made more transparent if we introduce an  order parameter ",
    ", @xmath10 , associated with the fluctuation term as follows :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 .",
    "the introduction of @xmath10 in this way makes perturbation arguments more transparent .",
    "however , the time functions can be equally as well expressed in terms of @xmath8 or @xmath13 , but in either case the approximation is to leading order in the size of the fluctuation .",
    "we refer to a curve as eulerian if it is stationary .",
    "the time method uses an eulerian curve @xmath14 that is defined kinematically as a streamline of the reference flow .",
    "it can be given as a solution of    @xmath15    with an initial condition @xmath16 at time @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath17 to be a physically meaningful boundary , @xmath18 must be a regular point of @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "a trajectory with an initial condition @xmath18 at time @xmath1 reaches @xmath21 at time @xmath22 in the reference flow .",

    "@xmath24 strictly as a spatial coordinate variable along @xmath17 while @xmath22 is a temporal variable .",
    "accordingly @xmath25 and    @xmath26    can be viewed as different parametrizations of the same trajectory , which we call the _ reference trajectory_. the cartesian pair of coordinates @xmath27 will prove to be particularly convenient for describing the time method . a glossary is provided in table  [ tbl : glssry ] for the principal definitions .    a hyperbolic stagnation point is a singular point . in the reference flow",

    "where @xmath34 and @xmath35 coincide , the reference streamline is called the _ separatrix _ or _ heteroclinic connection _ of the upstream dht @xmath36 and the downstream dht @xmath37 :    @xmath38    where the superscript @xmath39 stands for heteroclinic connection and the subscripts @xmath40 represent the direction of @xmath24 towards the corresponding dht .",
    "in addition , if @xmath41 and @xmath42 coincide , then @xmath43 is called the homoclinic connection .",
    "an invariant manifold is special case of kinematically - defined @xmath17 because @xmath24 has a semi - infinite or bi - infinite range as in ( [ eq : wus ] ) and ( [ eq : wh ] ) .",

    "are related by the local velocity , i.e. , @xmath46 .",

    "[ sec : pert_just ] we show that perturbation theory can provide valid approximations in situations where @xmath17 is defined over finite , semi - infinite or bi - infinite time intervals .",
    "it is worth noting here that for many of the most fruitful perturbation theories used in dynamical systems type analyses rarely are precise bounds available for the size of the perturbation for which the method is applicable .",
    "nevertheless , this has not limited the insights they have provided in a variety of applications . for example , the typical statements of melnikov s method @xcite indicate only that it is valid for @xmath10 sufficiently small .",
    "another example is the well - known kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theorem @xcite , which has been proven useful in many applications despite the fact that the bounds are generally too strict to be practically applicable .",
    "the situation with the kam theorem is even worse since rarely are the hypotheses of the theorem even verified in applications since they require the velocity to be expressed in action - angle variables , which can rarely be achieved .",
    "this limitation also prevents one from obtaining any type of bound on the perturbation for which the theorem is valid .",
    "having kinematically defined the eulerian boundary @xmath17 by the reference state , we now turn our attention to transport across @xmath17 .",
    "there are two aspects : one is concerned with the amount of flow property and the other is concerned with geometry of transport .",
