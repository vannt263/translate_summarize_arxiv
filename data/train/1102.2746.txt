    "the millisecond pulsars ( msps ) , which have a rotation period @xmath6  s and a stellar magnetic field @xmath7  g , are classified as a different generation from the canonical pulsars , which have @xmath8  s and @xmath9  g. the @xmath1 lat has detected @xmath0-ray emissions from about 60  pulsars in just two year observation , including 9 millisecond pulsars ( abdo et al .",
    "2010a , b , c , 2009a , b ; saz  parkinson et al . 2010 ) .",
    "furthermore , the detection of radio msps from about 20 unidentified @xmath1 point sources ( e.g. ray 2010 ; caraveo 2010 ; ranson et al .",
    "2011 ) has been reported .",
    "the msps are now recognized as one of the major populations of the galactic @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "the particle acceleration and high - energy @xmath0-ray radiation processes in the pulsar magnetosphere have been studied with the polar cap model ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ; daugherty & harding 1982 , 1996 ) , the slot gap model ( arons 1983 ; muslimov & harding 2003 ; harding et al . 2008 ) and the outer gap model ( cheng , ho & ruderman 1986a , b ; hirotani 2008 ; takata , wang & cheng 2010a ) respectively .",
    "all models have assumed that the charged particles are accelerated by the electric field along the magnetic field lines , and that the accelerating electric field arises in the charge deficit region , where the local charge density deviates from the goldreich - julian charge density ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) .",
    "the polar cap model assumes that the acceleration region is near the stellar surface . on the other hand ,",
    "the outer gap model and the slot gap model assume a strong acceleration region extending to the outer magnetosphere .",
    "for the canonical @xmath0-ray pulsars , several access of observational evidence have been proposed for the outer magnetospheric origin of the @xmath0-ray emissions ( aliu et al .",
    "2008 ; abdo et al .",
    ", 2009c ) .",
    "because the strength of the magnetic field at the outer magnetosphere of the msps is similar to that of canonical pulsars , @xmath10  g , it is expected that if the @xmath0-ray emissions of the msps originates from the outer magnetosphere , the emission characteristics ( e.g. pulse profile and spectrum ) will be similar to those of the canonical pulsars .",
    "romani & watters ( 2010 ) and watters & romani ( 2011 ) studied the pulse profiles of the canonical pulsars observed by @xmath1 .",
    "they computed the pulse profiles predicted by the outer gap model and slot gap model , and argued statistically that the outer gap geometry is more consistent with the observations than the slot gap geometry .",
    "venter , harding & guillemot ( 2009 ) fit the pulse profiles of the @xmath1 detected msps with the geometries predicted by the different high - energy emission models .",
    "they found that the pulse profiles of two out of eight millisecond pulsars can not be fitted by the geometries of either the outer gap or the slot gap models .",
    "they proposed a pair - starved polar cap model , in which the multiplicity of the pairs is not high enough to completely screen the electric field above the polar cap , and the particles are continuously accelerated up to high altitude over the entire open field line region .",
    "thus we see that the @xmath0-ray emission mechanism and the emission site in the msp s magnetosphere have not been satisfactorily explained up to now .",
    "the increase of population of detected @xmath0-ray emitting pulsars allows us to perform a more detailed population study of the high - energy emissions from the pulsars .",
    "a comparison between the simulated and observed distributions of the various pulsar characteristics ( e.g. rotation period and @xmath0-ray flux ) will be useful to test the high - energy emission model . with the canonical @xmath0-ray pulsars , takata , wang and cheng ( 2011 ) have studied the population predicted by the outer gap model .",
    "they predicted that with the sensitivity of the six - month long @xmath1 observation , about 100 @xmath0-ray emitting canonical pulsars can be detected , suggesting that the present observations have missed many @xmath0-ray emitting pulsars .",
    "for the msps , story , gonthier and harding ( 2007 ) have studied the population of @xmath0-ray msps with the slot gap accelerator models and predicted the @xmath1 observations .",
    "they predicted @xmath1 will detect 12 radio - loud and 33 - 40 radio - quiet @xmath0-ray msps .",
    "the population study of the msps is also important for an understanding the unidentified @xmath0-ray sources detected by @xmath1 . in the @xmath1 first source catalog , there are several hundred unidentified steady point sources ( abdo et al .",
    "takata et al . (",
    "2011 ) have argued that the @xmath1 unidentified sources located in the high galactic latitudes can not be explained by the galactic distribution of the canonical pulsars .",
    "the millisecond pulsars are possible candidates for the high galactic @xmath1 unidentified sources .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a monte - carlo study of the population of the @xmath0-ray emitting msps predicted by the outer gap model .",
    "in particular , we only study the population of msps in the galactic field ( not in the globular clusters ) . following the previous studies ( e.g. story et al . 2007 ; takata et al . 2011 )",

    "we will discuss the results of our simulation in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this study , we assume that all msps are born through the so called recycled process in the low - mass binary systems , with a birth rate of @xmath11 ( lorimer et al . 2005 ; lorimer 2008 ) . the birth location is determined by the spatial distributions proposed by paczynski ( 1990 ) , @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the axial distance from the axis through the galactic centre perpendicular to the galactic disk and @xmath15 is the distance from the galactic disk .",

    "for the distribution of the initial velocities of the msps , we assume a maxwellian distribution with a characteristic width of @xmath42  km / s ( c.f .",
    "hobbs et al . 2005 ) , namely , @xmath43 for the azimuthal component , the circular velocity due to the galactic gravitational potential field at the birth position of the msps is taken into account , and it is calculated from @xmath44^{1/2}.\\ ] ]      it is widely accepted that the msps are so called recycled pulsars , which were spun up by accretion of the matter from the low mass companion star . the rotation period of the newly born msp is related to the history of the accretion onto the neutron star . in particular , its rotation period in the accretion stage may be related to the equilibrium spin period , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the neutron star magnetic field in units of @xmath47  gauss , @xmath48 is the accretion rate in units of @xmath49  g / s , @xmath50 is the neutron star radius in units of @xmath51  cm and @xmath52 is the neutron star mass in units of 1.4 solar mass ( frank , king & raine , 2002 ) .",
    "however , the description of the transition from an accretion powered to the rotation powered phase is not well understood due to the complexities in the description of the interaction between the magnetosphere of a neutron star and its accretion disk .",
    "furthermore , the transition , for which a rapidly decreasing accretion rate is required ( e.g. jeffrey 1986 ) , may be facilitated by different processes between the long and the short orbital period systems .",
    "for the long orbital period systems , a red giant companion can detach from its roche lobe as its envelope is exhausted . on the other hand , for the short orbital period systems ,",
    "a possible mechanism leading to the sudden decreas in the accretion flow is the operation so called `` propeller effect '' ( campana et al .",
    "1998 ) , or dissolution of the disk by @xmath0-ray irradiation in the quiescent stage ( takata , cheng & taam , 2010b ) .",
    "the initial period of the msps will depend on the characteristic of the orbital motion and/or the termination mechanism of the accretion flow .    in the present study",
    ", we assume that all msps are not directly produced by supernova explosions , but that they are born by the recycled process in a low - mass binary system . on this assumption ,",
    "the true age of the msps , defined by the time since the neutron star was born in the supernova explosion , is different from the spin down age ( i.e. @xmath53 ) , and from the age defined by activating the rotation powered activity .",
    "because the time scale of the recycled process , including the decay of the neutron star s magnetic field and the accretion process , is not understood well , it is very difficult to calculate the present period and the magnetic field strength of msps from their initial distributions and the true age of msps .",
    "allowing for uncertainties , we use the observed distribution of the radio msps to assign `` current '' pulsar characteristics ( e.g. rotation period , magnetic field ) for each simulated msp , instead of modeling the initial distribution . in the usual monte - carlo studies for the galactic population of pulsars ( e.g. story et al .",
    "2007 ; takata et al . 2011 ) , the initial period is assigned for each simulated pulsar and then the current position and rotation period are obtained . in the present study ,",
    "on the other hand , we ( 1 ) generate the simulated msps with a constant birth rate over @xmath54  gyr , ( 2 ) obtain the current position as described in section  [ motion ] and ( 3 ) assign the pulsar parameters following the observed distributions .",
    "specifically , we assign the period time derivative ( @xmath55 ) and the stellar magnetic field ( @xmath56 ) for each simulated msp following the observed @xmath57 distribution , where we use the intrinsic value after removing the shklovskii effect ( see below ) . in this paper , we denote as @xmath56 the strength of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator , namely , @xmath58 . the current rotation period and the spin down age of simulated msps",
    "are calculated from @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively ( lyne & graham - smith , 2006 ) . here",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 are the rotation period in units of 0.001  s and the period time derivative in units of @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the distributions , which are used in the present simulation , are represented for the various characteristics of the simulated msps in figure  [ robs ] by the dashed lines .",
    "figure  [ robs ] also presents the observed distributions ( shaded - histograms , manchester et al . 2005 ) .",
    "shklovskii ( 1970 ) argued that the doppler shift resulting from the transverse motion of a pulsar makes a positive contribution to the pulsar s period time derivative as ( manchester 1999 ) , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the proper motion of the msp .",
    "for the msps whose period time derivative is extremely small , the shklovskii effect may significantly increase the period time derivative . for canonical pulsars , on the other hand ,",
    "the period time derivative is large , e.g. @xmath66 , which is much greater than that caused by the shklovskii effect .",
    "we note that the present procedure can be applied if the galactic distribution of the msps does not depend on the age of the rotation powered msps ( and spin down age ) ; that is , the galactic msp s populations of 1  gyr and of 10  gyr msps , for example , are described by the same distribution . with the present assumption that all msps are born through the recycled process , which has a characteristic time scale completely independent of the spin down age ,",
    "the galactic distribution is independent of the distribution of the spin down age . with a typical velocity of the observed msps , @xmath67  km / s ,",
    "it is expected that the typical displacement of msps with an age , @xmath68  myr , becomes larger than the size of the galaxy . however , with the slow velocity , the msps remain bound to the galaxy and hence their galactic distribution does not depend on the age of the rotation powered msps . on the other hand , for canonical pulsars ( in particular for the @xmath0-ray pulsars ) , the galactic distribution depends on the true age , which is almost equal to the spin - down age .",
    "this allow us to calculate the present period distribution from the initial distribution .      using the empirical relations among the radio luminosity , rotation period , and period time derivative",
    ", the distribution of the radio luminosity at 400  mhz is expressed by ( narayan & ostriker 1990 ) @xmath69 where @xmath70 $ ] with @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the luminosity in units of @xmath73 .",
    "here @xmath74 is a scaling factor to adjust the observed distribution , and @xmath75 for the canonical pulsars . in the present simulation for the msps , we find that @xmath76 can explain the distribution of the observed radio luminosity of the msps .",
    "the radio flux on earth is given by @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the distance to the msp .",
    "we scale the simulated 400  mhz luminosity to the observational frequency using a typical photon index @xmath791.8 ( kramer et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we also take into account the beaming effect of the radio emissions .",

    "we use the ten radio surveys ( molongo 2 , green band 2 and 3 , arecibo 2 and 3 , parks 1 , 2 and mb , jordell bank 2 and swinburne il ) , whose system characteristics are listed in table  1 of takata et al .",

    "2010a ) for the millisecond pulsars . in the outer gap ,",
    "the electrons and/or positrons are accelerated up to a lorentz factor of @xmath86 by the electric field along the magnetic field line .",
    "these accelerated particles can emit @xmath0-ray photons of several gev through the curvature radiation process . assuming the force balance between the electric force and the radiation drag force , the lorentz factor is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the curvature radius of the magnetic field lines and @xmath89 is the accelerating electric field . the accelerating electric field in the outer gap is approximately given by ( cheng et al .",

    "in addition , @xmath15 is the height measured from the last - open field line in the poloidal plane , and @xmath93 is the upper boundary of the gap .",
    "we note @xmath94constant along the field line for the dipole field geometry .",
    "the spectrum of the curvature radiation emitted by an individual particle may be written as @xmath95 where @xmath96 with @xmath97 and @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the modified bessel function of order 5/3 .",
    "if the @xmath0-ray beam points toward an observer , the observer will measure a phase - averaged spectrum of ( hirotani 2008 ) , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the particle number density , @xmath102 represents the radius from which the emission can be measured by the observer , @xmath103 is the cross section of the gap perpendicular to the magnetic field lines .",
    "we assume that the outer gap extends in the azimuthal direction with @xmath104  radian .",
    "the integrated energy flux between 100  mev and 300gev can be calculated from @xmath105    one can show that the @xmath0-ray flux described by equation  ( [ gaflux ] ) approximately satisfies @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the spin down power . if the typical energy of a curvature photon @xmath108 satisfies @xmath109  gev , the power radiated by a single charged particle is @xmath110 .",
    "furthermore , if we estimate the total number of charged particles in the gap in terms of values near the light cylinder as @xmath111 , we obtain @xmath112 where we have used @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the @xmath0-ray flux is proportional to the cube of the fractional gap thickness and the spin down power .",
    "we also assume as a zeroth order approximation that the gap current is of the order of the goldreich - julian value over the full width .",
    "the detailed calculation of the outer gap model ( e.g. takata & chang 2007 ) gives the current distributions in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field lines . on the other hand , by fitting the observed @xmath116-ray spectra of all mature pulsars detected by @xmath1,wang , takata & cheng ( 2010 ) find that the total current in the gap is of the order of the goldreich - julian value .",
    "we expect that as long as the total power of the @xmath0-ray radiation from the outer gap accelerator is concerned , the uniform current distribution with the goldreich - julian value would not be a bad approximation .",
    "let s discuss now the thickness of the outer gap accelerator .",
    "zhang & cheng ( 2003 ) estimated the gap thickness for the millisecond pulsars when the photon - photon pair - creation process controls the gap activities .",
    "they have argued that the gap thickness is controlled by the photon - photon pair - creation process between the @xmath0-rays emitted in the outer gap and the x - rays from the stellar surface , where the multiple magnetic field dominates the global dipole field ( ruderman 1991 , arons 1993 ) .",
    "they estimated the typical gap thickness divided by the light cylinder radius at the light cylinder as @xmath117 here @xmath118 is the distance ( in units of @xmath119  cm ) from the stellar surface to the position where the local magnetic field is equal to the dipole field . in the following",
    "we assume that @xmath120 .",
    "takata et al .",
    "( 2010a ) proposed the outer gap model , in which the gap thickness is determined by the magnetic pair - creation process near the stellar surface .",
    "they argued that the returning particles , which were accelerated in the gap , will emit photons with an energy @xmath121 by curvature radiation near the stellar surface , where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the electron rest mass energy and the fine structure constant , respectively .",
    "the 100mev photons form pairs by the magnetic pair creation process .",
    "the photon multiplicity is easily over @xmath124 for each incoming particle . for a simple dipole field structure",
    ", all pairs should move inward and can not affect the outer gap accelerator . however takata et al .",
    "( 2010a ) have argued that if the magnetic field lines near the surface , instead of being nearly perpendicular to the surface , are bending side - ways due to the strong local field , the pairs created on these local magnetic field lines can have an angle bigger than 90@xmath125 , which results in an outgoing flow of pairs . with this model ,",
    "the estimated fractional gap thickness is given by @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the polar cap radius , @xmath128 is the parameter characterizing the local magnetic field properties , @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the local magnetic field in units of @xmath131 g and the local curvature radius in units of @xmath132 cm , respectively . by fitting the radiation properties of the @xmath0-ray pulsars observed by @xmath1 , they find that @xmath133 for the canonical pulsars , while @xmath134 for the millisecond pulsars .",
    "when the fractional gap thickness @xmath135 is smaller ( or larger ) than @xmath136 , the magnetic pair - creation ( or photon - photon pair - creation ) process controls the gap thickness .    finally we discuss the maximum fractional thickness , @xmath137 , for the active outer gap accelerator .",
    "zhang & chang ( 1997 ) have argued that a pulsar with the fractional gap thickness larger than unity , @xmath138 , is not active , because the pairs are not created in the gap by the photon - photon pair - creation process .",
    "however , the outer gap accelerator can exist only between the last - open field lines and the critical field lines , which are defined by those magnetic field lines that have the null point of the goldreich - julian charge density at the light cylinder .",
    "therefore , we may define the maximum gap thickness as @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the polar angles of the last - closed field line and of the critical field line on the stellar surface , respectively . for the pure dipole field ,",

    "the results for these two cases may give a range of uncertainty of the present theoretical predictions .",
    "the observed characteristics of the @xmath0-ray emissions depend on the viewing angle and the inclination angle between the rotation axis and the magnetic axis . with the geometry of the outer gap model , stronger emissions",
    "are emitted toward a viewing angle @xmath147 , and the observed flux tends to decrease as the viewing angle closes to the rotation axis , where @xmath148 or @xmath149 . to take into account this effect",
    ", we calculate the @xmath0-ray flux , described in section  [ oflux ] , as a function of the viewing angle and of the inclination angle . in the calculation",
    ", we apply the vacuum dipole field geometry and assumed that the outer gap extends from the null charge point of the goldreich - julian charge density to @xmath150 or @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the axial distance from the rotation axis .",
    "we also assume for simplicity no azimuthal dependence of the gap structure .",
    "figure  [ gflux ] shows the dependence of the @xmath0-ray flux as a function of the viewing angle ( @xmath153 ) and of the inclination angle ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the vertical axis represents the fractional @xmath0-ray flux , which is defined as the @xmath0-ray flux divided by @xmath154 .",
    "the different lines correspond to the different inclination angles .",
    "the results are obtained for a rotation period @xmath155  ms and the stellar magnetic field @xmath156  gauss .",
    "we can see in figure  [ gflux ] that the calculated flux tends to decrease as the viewing angle  and the inclination angles decreases from @xmath84 .",
    "we can see that the general trend of the relation between the fractional @xmath0-ray flux and the viewing angle and the inclination angle , seen in figure  [ gflux ] , is maintained for different sets of the rotation periods and magnetic fields . in this study , for simplicity , we use the relations in figure  [ gflux ] for all sets of the rotation period and of the magnetic field .",
    "we assume that the inclination angle and the viewing angle are randomly distributed .",
    "however , we do not take into account the dependence of the spin down power on the inclination angle . the pulsar spin - down can result from both the current braking torque and the magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "the former can spin - down the pulsar even if the inclination angle is zero . according to the analysis of the force - free magnetosphere done by spitkovsky ( 2006 ) , the spin down power depends on the inclination angles as @xmath157 ; in other words , @xmath158 changes only by a factor of 2 with the inclination angle . with this small variation",
    ", we may expect that the general properties of the simulated distributions for the msp s characteristics ( such as the period and the magnetic field ) are not affected much by dependence on the inclination angle .",
    "in the monte - carlo simulations , we generated @xmath159 msps with a constant birth rate over 10  gyr .",
    "about 2100  radio msps were detected by the simulated radio surveys . scaling the simulated population to the number of radio msps in the atnf catalog , @xmath160",
    ", we obtain @xmath161 per year as the predicted averaged birth rate , which is consistent , within the uncertainties , with the other population studies ( e.g. ferrario & wickramasinghe 2007 ) .      in this section",
    ", we discuss the consistency of the observed and simulated distributions of the radio msps .",
    "first , figures  [ rdis ]  ( a ) and  ( b ) compare the observed ( shaded histograms ) and simulated ( dashed lines ) distributions of the radio luminosity at 400  mhz and of distance , respectively .",
    "we can see that the simulated distribution ( dashed lines ) qualitatively explain the observed features ; for example , the peak positions of the distributions . on the other hand , we find that it is difficult to explain the sharp peak at 1 - 2  kpc in the observed distribution of the distance .",
    "we argue that this excess in the observed distribution is caused by several msps , and that the excess may be produced by enhancements of the local medium ( e.g. the gould belt ) and of the local birth rate .",
    "for example , the age of the gould belt is believed to be @xmath162  yr ( grenier 2004 ) . because the birth rate of the canonical pulsars in the gould belt is expected to be one per @xmath119 yr , and",
    "because the birth rates of the msps in the galactic field are 2 - 3 orders smaller than that of the canonical pulsars , one may expect one per @xmath163  yr as the birth rate of the msps in the gould belt .",
    "this indicates that several msps can be born within the age of the gould belt . if one assumes that the typical radial velocity of msps is @xmath164  km / s @xmath165 km / s , then the displacement from the gould belt is @xmath166  kpc , which is consistent with the enhancement of the peak in the distribution of the distance .    figures  [ rdis](c ) and ( d ) show the averaged luminosity and spin down power , respectively , as a function of the distance .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are the results for the observations and for the simulations , respectively , and each bin of the histograms has the same number of observed msps .",
    "we find in figures  [ rdis](c ) and ( d ) that the present simulation describes characteristics of the observations very well , that is , the averaged radio luminosity increases with the distance and the averaged spin down power is almost constant with the distance .",
    "finally , we can see that the simulated msps can reproduce the galactic longitude and latitude distributions of the radio msps . on these grounds , we conclude that our simulation reproduces the galactic distribution of the radio msps .      in this section ,",
    "we compare the results of our simulation with the @xmath1 six - month long observations .",
    "@xmath1 has found 9 `` radio - selected '' @xmath0-ray emitting msps with a flux @xmath167 ( abdo et al 2009b ; abdo et al .",
    "2010a , c ) , and all of them are located at high galactic latitudes , that is , @xmath168 .",
    "abdo et al . ( 2010a ) show that the sensitivity of the low galactic latitudes is about a factor of three worse as compared with that of high galactic latitudes . in the present simulation ,",
    "therefore , we use @xmath169 for the galactic latitudes @xmath168 and @xmath170 for @xmath171 as the sensitivity requirement of the radio - selected msps for the six - month long observations . because no @xmath0-ray - selected msps have been detected so far",

    "we also predict 22 - 35 @xmath0-ray - selected msps , whereas @xmath1 has had no such detections so far . for the canonical pulsars",
    ", the sensitivity of the blind search is about a factor of 2 worse as compared with that of the radio - selected pulsars ( abdo et al .",
    "the population of the @xmath0-ray - selected pulsars is roughly comparable with that of the radio - selected @xmath0-ray pulsars . on the other hand",
    ", it is expected that the detection of the rotation period from the msps ( in particular in binary systems ) by the blind search is even harder and the sensitivity is much worse than that of the canonical pulsars .",
    "figure  [ dispropr ] compares the cumulative distributions of the various characteristics of the observed 9 ( solid lines ) @xmath0-ray msps detected by @xmath1 ( abdo etal . 2009b ; abdo et al . 2010a , b , c ) and the simulated ( dashed lines ) radio - selected @xmath0-ray msps .",
    "the results are for @xmath146 .",
    "we performed a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test to compare the two cumulative distributions . in figure",
    "[ dispropr ] , we present the maximum deviation ( @xmath183 ) between the two distributions and the p - value ( @xmath184 ) of the ks - test for each pulsar characteristics . since the simulated sample has more than 400 pulsars , we used the one - sample ks statistic . for example , the p - value for the rotation period is @xmath185 , suggesting that the hypothesis that the two distributions are drawn from the same distribution can not be rejected at better than 25% confidence level .",
    "we find in figure  [ dispropr ] that for all distributions except that for the flux distribution , the hypothesis can not be rejected at better than 60% , indicating that the model distributions are consistent with the observations .    for the @xmath0-ray flux ( right - bottom panel in figure  [ dispropr ] ) ,",
    "the result of the ks - statistic provides a relatively low p - value , as compared with other characteristics .",
    "this is because all 9 msps detected by @xmath1 have a @xmath0-ray flux smaller than @xmath178 , while the model predicts that about 20% of @xmath0-ray msps have a flux larger than @xmath178 .",
    "however , we note that the difference between the observed and simulated distributions is caused by only one or two msps . hence",
    ", if several msps with a bright @xmath0-ray emissions of @xmath186 have been missed by the @xmath1 observations , the model distribution is not in conflict with the observations .",
    "it is important to note that our simulation results are based on the existing radio sensitivities of pulsar surveys .",
    "any deep radio search implies increasing the radio sensitivities and consequently some @xmath116-ray selected msps can become radio - loud .",
    "in fact , several radio msps have been detected by deep search for the radio emissions from bright @xmath1 unidentified sources ( ransom et al .",
    "these radio - loud @xmath116-ray msps are defined as @xmath116-ray selected msps in our simulations .    as table  1",

    "this implies that most of the presently known radio msps ( @xmath160 ) might not be discovered by @xmath1 .",

    "[ number ] , we summarize the population of the @xmath0-ray emitting msps detected within the simulation as a function of the threshold energy flux of the @xmath0-rays .",
    "the solid lines and dashed lines represent the population of the radio - selected and @xmath0-ray - selected @xmath0-ray msps respectively .",
    "the thick and thin lines represent results for the maximum fractional gap thickness of @xmath146 and @xmath189 , respectively .",
    "for example , the present simulation predicts that @xmath190 and @xmath191 radio - selected @xmath0-ray msps irradiate the earth with a @xmath0-ray flux @xmath192 and @xmath167 , respectively . for the radio - quiet @xmath0-ray msps , about 100 sources with a flux larger than @xmath193 irradiate",
    "the earth    we can see in figure  [ number ] that the numbers of @xmath0-ray - selected msps increase more rapidly than that of the radio - selected @xmath0-ray msps and the ratio of the @xmath0-ray - selected to radio - selected @xmath0-ray msps increase with decreasing the threshold energy flux . as the threshold of @xmath0-ray energy flux decreases , the @xmath0-ray emissions from more distant msps can be detected in the simulations .",
    "on the other hand , because we fix the sensitivity of the radio surveys in figure  [ number ] , the radio emissions from those distant msps may not be detected by the radio surveys . as a result , more @xmath0-ray selected msps",
    "are detected in the simulations as the threshold flux decreases .",
    "in fact , if we count all @xmath0-ray msps irradiating the earth with the radio emissions as the radio - selected pulsars , the ratio does not depend on the threshold energy flux of the @xmath0-ray emissions .    figure  [ dis2d ] shows contours of the two - dimensional distribution in the rotation period and the period - time derivative of the simulated msps with a @xmath0-ray flux @xmath167 .",
    "we present the distributions for all simulated msps including the radio - selected and @xmath0-ray - selected pulsars , because the two distributions do not differ much from each other .",
    "the left panel shows the distributions using the period time derivative for the intrinsic value , and the right panel represents the period time derivative for the `` observed '' value , that is , the value after adding the shklovskii effect described by equation  ( [ shk ] ) . within solid , dashed and dotted lines ,",
    "10% , 50% and 100% of the total msps are populated .",
    "we can see that the shklovskii effect slightly shifts the peak of the distributions toward longer rotation periods and larger period time derivatives . for the observational distributions ( right panel ) , about 50% of the @xmath0-ray emitting",
    "msps will be detected with a rotation period between @xmath194  s and a period time derivative between @xmath195 .",
    "this information can be used to narrow down the parameter range for a blind search to detect the rotation period from @xmath1 unidentified sources .",
    "as figure  [ number ] shows , our simulation predicts that about @xmath196 @xmath0-ray msps irradiate the earth with a flux @xmath197 and with the present sensitivity of the radio surveys most of them are categorized as @xmath0-ray - selected msps .",
    "therefore , it is likely that although millisecond pulsed emission has not been confirmed yet , the @xmath0-ray msps contribute to the galactic unidentified @xmath1 sources , such as the newly discovered 20  radio msps associated with the @xmath1 unidentified sources ( ray 2010 ; caraveo 2010 ; ransom et al .",

    "the filled circles , boxes and triangles correspond to the pulsars , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and @xmath1 unidentified sources . in figure",

    "most of the @xmath1 unidentified sources have the v - index smaller than @xmath7930 , with the c - index larger than 0.1 .",

    "we plot the galactic distributions of the @xmath1 unidentified steady sources for @xmath201 ( solid line ) and @xmath198 ( dashed line ) .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ galc ] that the two lines represent different distributions with respect to each other .",
    "the solid lines show relatively constant distributions for the galactic longitudes and latitudes , indicating that most of the @xmath1 unidentified sources with @xmath201 ( dashed lines ) distribute isotropically in the sky , and may be related with extra - galactic ( or galactic halo ) sources . for the dashed - lines , on the other hand , the distributions for the galactic longitudes and latitudes coordinate show peaks at the galactic centre and at the galactic disk , respectively , suggesting that the @xmath1 unidentified steady sources with @xmath198 are associated with galactic objects .    in figure  [ galmsp ]",
    ", we compare the distributions of the galactic longitudes ( left panel ) and latitudes ( right panel ) for the unidentified @xmath1 sources with @xmath202 and @xmath198 ( solid line ) and the simulated @xmath0-ray msps ( dashed line ) , with a flux @xmath203 .",

    "( 2011 ) and the galactic distributions for known radio msps ( dotted lines ) are also plotted in the figure .    in figures  [ galmsp ]",
    "we can see that the distributions of the simulated @xmath0-ray msps and of the observed radio msps are consistent with that of the @xmath1 unidentified sources , that is , ( 1 ) three longitude distributions have a peak around the direction of the galactic centre @xmath204 and become minimum around @xmath205 , and ( 2 ) the latitude distributions have a peak at the galactic plane ( @xmath206 ) and then they decreas with the increase of the galactic latitudes .",
    "in particular , the msps can explain the distributions of the @xmath1 unidentified sources located above the galactic plane @xmath207 , which can not be explained by the canonical @xmath0-ray pulsars , as the right panel in figure  [ galmsp ] shows ; the @xmath0-ray emitting canonical pulsars can mainly explain the unidentified sources located in the galactic plane .",
    "since the msps are in general older than the canonical pulsars , a higher fraction of the @xmath0-ray msps , as compared with the canonical pulsars , is located at higher galactic latitudes . on these ground , we conclude that @xmath0-ray emitting msps are more plausible as candidates for the origin of the majority of the galactic @xmath1 unidentified steady sources located in high galactic latitudes .",
    "we note that new radio msps have been discovered in the direction of about 20 unidentified @xmath1 sources by the radio searches for individual source ( e.g. ray 2010 ; caraveo 2010 ; ransom et al .",
    "these _ @xmath0-ray - selected radio - loud _ msps can be classified as the @xmath0-ray - selected radio - quiet sources in the present simulation , because we do not take into account the radio search for the specific sources . in table  2 ,",
    "on the other hand , we present how the population of @xmath0-ray emitting msps depends on the sensitivity of the radio survey .",
    "we used the arecibo  2 ( a2 ) and parks  2 ( p2 ) surveys ( the first row ) , all radio surveys ( the second row ) listed in table  1 of takata et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and all radio survey but we increase by a factor of 2 the sensitivity of each survey ( third row ) .",
    "the intrinsic populations , that is , the populations associated with only beaming effects of the radio emission are shown in the bottom row .",
    "we can see in table  2 that the number of radio - selected pulsars increases with the increase of the sensitivity of the radio surveys , whereas the @xmath0-ray - selected pulsars decrease .",
    "this is because if we increase the sensitivity of the radio surveys some @xmath0-ray - selected msps irradiating the earth with the radio emissions may be re - classified as radio - selected @xmath0-ray pulsars . as the bottom row in table  2 shows , the intrinsic ratio of the radio - loud and radio - quiet @xmath0-ray msps is 10@xmath208 , indicating that most of the @xmath0-ray emitting msps irradiate the earth with a corresponding radio emission .",
    "therefore , our prediction is that as the sensitivity of the radio observations will improve in the future , more and more radio msps will be discovered among the @xmath1 unidentified sources .    in figure",
    "[ disprop ] , we present the distributions of various characteristics of observed @xmath0-ray msps ( shaded histograms ) , including the 20 new radio msps associated with @xmath1 unidentified sources , and the simulated @xmath0-ray msps ( dashed lines ) with the simulated sensitivity of the @xmath1 six - month long observation . for the simulated distribution , both the radio - selected and @xmath0-ray - selected msps are taken into account . for the observations , we were able to obtain information of the rotation period for 7 out the 20 radio msps and the distances for 3 msps ( ray , 2010 ; ransom et al .",
    "therefore the distributions of the rotation period and of the distance in figure  [ disprop ] are obtained from 16 ( 9 known @xmath1 msps plus 7 radio msps ) and 12 samples , respectively .",
    "the distributions of the period time derivative , the magnetic field and the spin down age include only 9 known @xmath1 msps , because we could not find any references for the intrinsic period time derivative of the 20  radio msps .",

    "the simulated distributions are qualitatively consistent with the observations ( e.g. the position of the peak of the distributions ) . for the @xmath0-ray flux ,",
    "however , the p - value of ks - test is much lower than those of other characteristics , indicating that the two distributions can not be drawn from same distribution . because it is expected that the @xmath0-ray emissions from the 20  radio msps associated with @xmath1 unidentified sources will be composed of a pulsed and an unpulsed component , the extraction of the pulsed component , that is , the detection of the pulsed period with @xmath1 , is required to constrain our model .",
    "we have assumed that msps are activated as the rotation powered pulsar as a result of the accretion process from the companion star .",

    "the geometry of the outer gap can direct the @xmath116-rays emitted from the gap towards the companion star and the accretion disk .",
    "consequently , the accretion disk can be evaporated , and the companion star becomes brighter due to the irradiation of @xmath116-rays .",
    "if the high latitude unidentified sources of @xmath1 are indeed msps , some of them may be low mass binaries in a quiescent state .",
