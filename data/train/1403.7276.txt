    "thus , how to construct point sets has been a major concern in qmc theory .",
    "one of the known good construction frameworks is digital nets , which is based on linear algebra over finite fields ( or more generally over finite rings ) .",

    "let us recall the notion of qmc integration .",
    "for an integrable function @xmath18 and a finite point set in an @xmath19-dimensional unit cube @xmath20 , quasi monte - carlo ( qmc ) integration of @xmath21 by @xmath22 is an approximation value @xmath23 of the actual integration @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the cardinality of @xmath22 .",
    "the qmc integration error is defined as @xmath26 if the integrand @xmath21 has bounded variation in the sense of hardy and krause , the koksma - hlawka inequality shows that @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the total variation of @xmath21 and @xmath29 is the star - discrepancy of @xmath22 .",
    "there have been many studies on the construction of low - discrepancy point sets , i.e. , point sets with @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , digital nets and sequences are a general framework for the construction of good point sets .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for the general information on qmc integration and digital nets and sequences .",
    "recently , higher order convergence results for digital nets , i.e. , @xmath31 converges faster than @xmath32 , has been established . for a given integer @xmath33",
    ", dick gave quadrature rules for @xmath0-smooth integrands which achieve @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "he introduced a weight which gives a bound on a criterion @xmath35 ( he did not give a name and we use the name in @xcite ) for a digital net @xmath22 over a finite field with cardinality @xmath36 , and proved a koksma - hlawka type inequality @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a norm of @xmath21 for a sobolev space and @xmath39 is a constant depend only on @xmath36 , @xmath19 , and @xmath0 .",

    "wafom also satisfies a koksma - hlawka type inequality ( with some errors due to discretization ) .",
    "one remarkable merit of wafom is that wafom is easily computable by the inversion formula ( * ? ? ? * ( 4.2 ) ) , which is easier to implement than the formula of @xmath41 derived from ( * ? ? ?",

    ", they executed a random search of low - wafom point sets and showed that such point sets perform better than some standard low - discrepancy point sets .",
    "there are several studies on low - wafom point sets .",
    "the existence of low - wafom point sets was shown by matsumoto and yoshiki @xcite .",
    "the author proved that the interlacing construction for higher order qmc point sets with niederreiter - xing sequences over a finite field gives low - wafom point sets @xcite .    in this paper , as a generalization of @xcite we propose the dick weight and wafom for digital nets over @xmath16 and for subgroups of @xmath17 where @xmath4 is a finite abelian group .",
    "wafom over @xmath16 is also a discretized version of dick s method and thus satisfies a koksma - hlawka type inequality .",
    "moreover , we give a macwilliams - type identity of weight enumerator polynomials for the dick weight . using this identity",
    "we obtain a computable formula of the minimum dick weight as well as wafom , which is a generalization of the inversion formula for wafom in the dyadic case . furthermore , we give generalizations of known properties of wafom over @xmath2 in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we give a lower bound on wafom and prove the existence of low - wafom point sets .",
    "in particular , we improve some of the results in @xcite .",

    "these results are similar to the works of dick , but there is no implication between them .",
