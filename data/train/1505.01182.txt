    "<S> provided the total number of modes in such a protocol is not greater than that of an @xmath2-mode lpu , the network can be mapped to the device via its unitary matrix description , or ( due to symmetry and structure ) a direct implementation can be recognised . in the following sections we explain the circuits implemented , and </S>",
    "<S> note that both compiling methods are used . </S>",
    "<S> while the generality of this lpu makes it well suited to implementing random unitaries , it is not optimised for the highly structured unitaries that typically implement qubit operations . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , this system demonstrates fidelities greater than those reported for optical chips that have been custom made for lo quantum processing tasks . throughout this manuscript </S>",
    "<S> two error analysis methods are used : those for individual fidelities @xmath49 calculated by propagating poissonian count rate errors , and those for mean fidelities @xmath50 calculated as @xmath51 . </S>",

    "<S> detection in ancilla modes @xmath53 occurs with probability @xmath54 and heralds the state @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 represents @xmath57 photons in the @xmath58 mode ) over the remaining modes with unit probability in the ideal case . </S>",
    "<S> operating the bsg with the non - ideal state from our spdc source requires the bell state to be detected to remove the unwanted photon terms ( see appendix for details ) .    after implementing the bsg , measurements on both qubits in the computational basis @xmath59 are straightforward and arbitrary single qubit measurements on the @xmath60 modes @xmath61 are possible with an unused mzi . </S>",
    "<S> we were also able to measure both qubits in the conjugate basis @xmath62 by adding a fibre - looped sagnac interferometer on the @xmath63 modes to send this qubit back through the chip to meet an mzi at the input facet ( see appendix for details ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we found the statistical fidelity for the common basis measurements @xmath59 and @xmath62 to be @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively , and the uncommon bases @xmath66 and @xmath67 to be @xmath68 and @xmath69 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : fig2](h ) is a two - photon scheme that requires the detection of the two photonic qubits in a computational state to signal the success of the gate with probability @xmath75 @xcite . as the scheme requires only two photons ( which our source produces with high fidelity ) it allows for a less obfuscated test of our device for logical operations .    </S>",

    "<S> we perform full quantum process tomography using an over complete set of 324 truth tables from all possible combinations of pauli eigenvector input states and pauli basis measurements ( see appendix for details ) , finding a mean statistical fidelity between all experimentally reconstructed truth tables and ideal values to be @xmath77 .    </S>",
    "<S> we performed single qubit process tomography on the hadamard ( @xmath78 ) , @xmath19 ( @xmath79 ) and @xmath80 gates , finding process fidelities of @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 respectively , demonstrating very high fidelities for operations requiring only one - photon interference . + * _ haar random unitaries : _ * along with three - photon ensembles injected into modes @xmath86 , as a benchmarking exercise we injected the one and two photon states @xmath87 and @xmath88 yielding fidelities of @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively . for three of our three - photon boson sampling unitaries ( those that gave the highest , lowest , and mode fidelity ) we recalculated the statistical fidelities based on the recovered unitary @xmath91 . </S>",
