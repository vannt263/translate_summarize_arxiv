    "the thermal expansion observed in most solids is a hallmark of anharmonic interatomic or intermolecular potentials . whereas a hard , steep potential results in relatively small thermal expansion , a softer , shallow potential leads to substantial thermal expansion , e.g. in organic molecular materials , where the molecules are held together by weak van der waals ( vdw ) forces .",
    "thus the thermal expansion is caused by changes of the arrangement of the molecules rather than by the small temperature - dependence of the intramolecular ( covalent ) bonds .",
    "on the other hand , _ negative _ thermal expansion ( i.e. contraction ) can not be explained by a simple anharmonic two - center potential .",
    "quite a few inorganic materials show either volume or uniaxial negative thermal expansion ( nte ) @xcite with zrw@xmath3o@xmath4 as the most prominent example of large , isotropic nte over a wide temperature range @xcite . in @xmath5-zrw@xmath3o@xmath4 ( low temperature phase ) and @xmath6-zrw@xmath3o@xmath4 ( high temperature phase ) , the linear expansion coefficient @xmath5 is @xmath7k@xmath8 and @xmath9k@xmath8 , respectively @xcite .",
    "in contrast , only very few examples of ( uniaxial ) nte in organic systems are known so far ( see ref . and refs .",
    "therein ) .    in general , nte is caused by special geometrical arrangements of the atoms / molecules and peculiarities of the bonding which restrict the thermal movement of the atoms / molecules such that nte occurs for geometrical reasons .",
    "often , such materials are characterized by open , underconstrained lattices or by a network of rigid , underconstrained entities .",
    "for example , rotation of the rigid wo@xmath10 building blocks causes the overall contraction in zrw@xmath3o@xmath4 @xcite . for organic materials ,",
    "different mechanisms may be involved .",
    "for instance , polyethylene @xcite contracts _ along _ the covalent chains as a consequence of increased vibrations perpendicular to the chains , i.e. due to motions in direction of weak vdw interactions @xcite .",
    "another mechanism has been observed for a dipeptide ( trpgly@xmath11h@xmath3o ) crystal @xcite : the ordering of water molecules ( located within the supramolecular peptide helices ) with decreasing temperatures is responsible for the uniaxial nte .    the intermolecular potential and its anharmonicity determine both thermal expansion and the details of thermal libration and translation motions .",
    "both of them are accessible to experimental probes . to this end , we have performed full x - ray structure analyses of pentacene single crystals in the temperature range from 120400k .",
    "the thermal expansion ellipsoid is calculated for pentacene and the other acene crystals , and is highly anisotropic .",
    "pentacene crystals contract upon warming along one direction which is close to the in - plane @xmath0 direction .",
    "the microscopic origin of nte is elucidated by an analysis of the refined atomic displacement parameters in terms of molecular motions .",
    "anomalously large librations about the long molecular axis at elevated temperatures are observed , while the other librations and translations are mostly suppressed due to steric hindrance within the dense herringbone packed layers . as a consequence , the herringbone angle changes , resulting in an expansion approximately along @xmath2 and a contraction along @xmath0 .",
    "single crystals of pentacene were grown in a temperature gradient _ in vacuo _ , or by physical vapor phase transport with high purity argon as the transport gas @xcite .",
    "pentacene crystals were investigated between room temperature and 400k , using an enraf / nonius cad4 diffractometer ( cuk@xmath12 ) with a home - made temperature control system , and additionally between 120k and 413k on the swiss - norwegian beamline ( snbl , @xmath13 ) at esrf ( grenoble ) .",

    "it is noteworthy that this simplified picture of one dominant libration @xmath39 is most appropriate for pentacene and tetracene , where the inertial tensor is anisotropic enough to align @xmath39 with the long molecular axis within 57@xmath42 .",

    ", this corresponds to lattice phonons with @xmath50 .",
    "consequently , an _ effective _ herringbone angle @xmath51 was calculated , which varies more rapidly with temperature than the measured , `` averaged '' herringbone angle @xmath29 , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ lvst ] . taken together , the information in fig .  [ lvst ] reflects the anharmonic potential sensed by the thermal motion .",
    "an additional factor for the negative expansion is the increased vdw force along @xmath0 due to an increased cofacial overlap of the pentacene molecules : the tilt angle @xmath30 against @xmath52 ( definition in fig .",

    "the displacement of the pentacene molecules is slightly reduced from 2.10  at 120k over 2.05  at 295k to 1.98  at 413k , and thus the cofacial overlap and the attractive vdw forces along @xmath0 increase .    ,",

    "the libration along the long molecular axis , @xmath39 , together with a change of the herringbone angle , are responsible for the anisotropic thermal expansion , with @xmath0 contracting and @xmath2 expanding .",

    "it can be expected that the asymmetry and the uniaxial negative expansion is even more pronounced in longer herringbone packed acenes , e.g. hexacene . in particular the effect of increasing vdw forces along the short unit cell axis , and the related change of the tilt angle are enhanced , as well as the steric hindrance within the herringbone layer .",
    "however , the decreasing stability and the increasing ease of oxidation with increasing @xmath17 , as well as the reported difficulties in growing hexacene crystals with reasonable quality @xcite make single crystal studies a challenge .",

    "pentacene contracts along @xmath0 as a result of the increasing herringbone angle ( @xmath54=0.30.6@xmath1 per 100k ) , supported by the frustation of larger librations and translations perpendicular to the long molecule axis due to steric hindrance .",
