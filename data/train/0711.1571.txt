    "the amount of violation ( cpv ) currently discovered in nature is not sufficient to explain the universe as we see it .",
    "looking in the charm sector is a natural extension of this task .",
    "three are the kinds of cpv we deal with : cpv in the @xmath1 mixing matrix , which is expected to be insignificant in the charm sector , cpv in the decay amplitudes , and cpv in the interference between mixing and decay , which should be very small as well . the second one is also known as direct cpv and will be covered in this paper .",
    "the expression for the asymmetry resulting from a process @xmath2 and its conjugate @xmath3 is given by :    @xmath4    @xmath5 and @xmath6 are two components of the decay amplitude and @xmath7 the corresponding strong phase difference .",
    "it follows that two amplitudes with different strong as well as weak phases are needed to have cpv . in the realm of the sm ,",
    "usually this means a tree and a penguin amplitude .",
    "the kinds of processes described in the following are categorized as cabibbo favored ( cf , @xmath8 ) , suppressed ( cs , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , and doubly suppressed ( dcs , @xmath11 ) , according to the kind of vertices that intervene in the charm quark decay .    in contrast to the beauty sector , the standard model ( sm ) charm sector is largely conserving , as it involves 4 quarks and the @xmath12 cabibbo mixing matrix is real . in singly cabibbo",
    "suppressed decays diluted weak phases can produce asymmetries of the order @xmath13 , while no weak phases , hence no cpv , exist in cf and dcs decays , except for some minimal asymmetry in the @xmath14 mode .",
    "it is interesting to notice that it is possible in principle to distinguish direct and indirect cpv , either combining direct asymmetries with time - dependent measurements both for cp eigenstates , or just using time integrated measurements for cf cp eigenstate modes ( assuming negligible cpv in cf modes ) as @xmath15  @xcite .    new physics",
    "( np ) can contain violating couplings that could show up at the percent level  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "several extensions of the sm predict such asymmetries , including models with leptoquarks , a fourth generation of fermions , right - handed weak currents , or extra higgs doublets .",
    "precision measurements and theory are required to detect np .",
    "the charm sector is in a unique position to test physics beyond the sm . in particular it can test models where cpv is generated in the up - like quark sector .",
    "flavor models where the ckm mixing is generated in the up sector generally predict large d - mixing and sizable cpv in charm , but smaller effects in the beauty sector .",
    "furthermore , scs @xmath0 decays are now more sensitive to gluonic penguin amplitudes than are charmless b decays  @xcite . in summary , finding cpv in cf and dcs decays or finding cpv above 0.1% in scs decays would indicate np .",
    "there are several ways direct and t violation can be looked for : by measuring asymmetries in time integrated partial widths or in final state distributions of dalitz plots or by measuring t violation via t - odd correlations with 4-body @xmath0 decays . as an example of charged @xmath0 decays , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the reconstructed mass distributions in @xmath16 and @xmath17 candidates in the  detector , with fairly large datasets ( 80 @xmath18 )  @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry results of these and many other analyses are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "and @xmath17 candidates ( mass distributions ) used for cpv measurements.,width=302 ]    as mentioned earlier , in the sm we can expect direct cpv at the @xmath19 level in scs decays , but no cpv in cf modes . in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 modes",
    "it is puzzling that the ratio of their branching ratios is so different from 1 ( @xmath222.8 ) .",
    "this entails the presence of large final state interactions ( fsi ) and/or large penguin contributions , which could be fertile ground for np to manifest itself .",
    "phenomenological calculations set sm limits at or well below the @xmath19 level  @xcite .",
    "the cdf collaboration has to date the best measurements for these modes .",
    "the asymmetries are normalized to the cf @xmath23 mode .",
    "difficulties for this analysis are due to the track charge asymmetry which is calibrated with @xmath24 control samples and to the partially reconstructed @xmath0 background for the @xmath20 mode .",
    "total systematics are slightly above 0.5@xmath25  @xcite .    a high precision analysis at  reports @xmath26 for the @xmath20 mode and @xmath27 for the @xmath21 mode  @xcite .",
    "to keep the systematics so low , the keys are to calibrate charge and tagging asymmetries using data , namely the cf @xmath23 mode , and to account for forward - backward asymmetries due to qed effects , which can produce detection asymmetries in a detector as , due to the boost of the center of mass system with respect to the laboratory .",
    "charm factories benefit with respect to the beauty ones from a pure @xmath28 final state with low multiplicity , hence high tagging efficiency .",
    "this makes them competitive with the high statistics at  and belle .",
    "single tag efficiencies range from 25 to 65@xmath25 , values unimaginable at the b - factories .",
    "most of the new cp violation results from cleo - c , with 281 @xmath29 of data , are for cf modes , with the exception of @xmath30 ( see tables  [ tab1 ] and  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "the uncertainties are of the order of 1@xmath25 in most cases , for modes with charged kaons , the kaon systematics are the largest ones .    in case of indirect cpv and final eigenstates ,",
    "the time integrated and time dependent asymmetries are universal and equal to each other .",
    "in contrast , for direct cpv , the time - integrated asymmetries in principle are not expected to be universal .",
    "hence parts of phase - space in a multi - body decay might have different asymmetries ( which may even cancel each other out when integrated over the whole phase - space ) .",
    "in addition , np might not show up in the decay rates asymmetries but instead in the phase difference between amplitudes .",
    "3-body decays permit the measurement of such phase differences .",
    "the dalitz plot technique allows increased sensitivity to asymmetry by probing the decay amplitude rather than the decay rate and access to both cp eigenstates and non eigenstates with relatively high statistics .",
    "the cleo - c collaboration has measured the asymmetry in the @xmath31 mode ( integrated over the sum of all amplitudes in the dalitz plot ) and has also performed a full fledged dalitz plot analysis of the @xmath32 decay  @xcite . the  and belle collaborations can exploit their larger datasets for similar measurements .",
    "t violation measurements can be performed exploiting t - odd correlations between the momenta of the decay products of 4-body @xmath0 decays as @xmath33 , while assuming conservation :    @xmath34    under time reversal @xmath35 changes sign , but its being different from 0 is not sufficient to establish t - violation as final state interactions can fake this asymmetry  @xcite . to overcome this problem the analogous quantity from the conjugate decay can be defined as :    @xmath36    finding @xmath37 establishes t violation .",
    "t - odd asymmetries can be built as :    @xmath38    and the t violation asymmetry as :    @xmath39    and if this is different from 0 , t violation is established , even in the presence of strong phases  @xcite .",
    "as for the available measurements the only ones to date are from the focus collaboration ( see tables  [ tab1 ] and  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "the cleo , , and belle experiments should better this analysis with their larger and cleaner data samples .",
    "most of the measurements of and t violation in neutral @xmath0 decays to date are shown in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "no evidence of direct cpv has been found .",
    "the best limits are of the order of one to few percent statistical errors with systematics of similar magnitude ; few measurements have errors below the 1@xmath25 level .",
    "most of these are old measurements , except for the new ones from the cleo - c collaboration and the ones `` byproducts '' of the mixing analyses of the  and belle collaborations .",
    ".@xmath40 measurements to date using neutral @xmath0 decays .",
    "the last row reports a measurement of @xmath41 by the focus collaboration .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab3 ]",
    "the future prospects for these measurements are very promising . for the @xmath42 and @xmath43 modes both b - factories and cdf",
    "are expected to reach very interesting sensitivities of the order of few per thousand .",
    "the issue at the tevatron will be whether the trigger can cope with the increase of luminosity .",
    "the @xmath44 mode should hit interesting limits as well , if systematics can be hold under control .",
    "very promising are also measurements from dalitz plot analyses using scs modes , where we have the added puzzle that it is not known where ( if anywhere ) cpv can show up in the dalitz plane .",
    "furthermore , the asymmetry could be large , but confined to only a part of the phase - space .    for the t - correlation analyses , as aforementioned there are large datasets of 4-body @xmath0 decays available . the  and belle collaborations could achieve statistical uncertainties at or below 0.5@xmath25 if systematics can be kept as low .    if the present machines can not fully probe the extent of the cp asymmetries allowed by np or given to us by nature , new experiments at besiii and at the super b - factories at kek and/or frascati , or lhc - b at the lhc definitely will .",
    "data taking at besiii is expected to start in 2008 . with 3 years of running it",
    "will get up to 20 times the cleo - c dataset .",
    "the super b - factories should record @xmath2210 @xmath45 of data per year .",
    "at least the super b - factory at frascati is designed to run at the psi(3770 ) as well with an estimated 1 @xmath45 of data per year .",
    "lhc - b will implement a dedicated @xmath46 trigger as well , selecting huge and clean samples of hadronic @xmath0 decays .",
    "this should assure a @xmath46 dataset of the order of 100 times the one at cdf in the first year of nominal luminosity running .",
    "with all this data we will reach a phase of high precision cpv measurements , with uncertainties of the order of @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) with one year of nominal running at lhc - b ( super - b factories ) .",
    "charm physics provides unique opportunities for indirect searches for new physics .",
    "the theoretical calculations of the @xmath49 mixing parameters have large uncertainties , hence physics beyond the standard model will be hard to rule out from @xmath49 mixing measurements alone .",
    "the observation of large cpv would instead be a clear and robust signal of new physics .",
    "there have been some exciting new results this year from the cleo - c , belle , and  collaborations .",
    "the total uncertainties are at the 1@xmath25 level in several modes , but still far from observation .",
    "experiments are just now entering the interesting domain .",
    "the future ahead is very promising with good sensitivities achievable by current experiments and high precision measurements expected with future and planned efforts .",
    "i would like to thank the conference organizers for their help and gracious hospitality in ithaca , my charming mentors , brian meadows and mike sokoloff , and students , kalanand mishra and rolf andreassen , from the university of cincinnati , as well as all my other colleagues who have been , are , and will be working on this exciting subject .",
