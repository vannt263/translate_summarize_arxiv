    "in recent years , there has been increasing observational evidence that many nearby galaxies have central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the mass range of @xmath13 , and that their physical properties correlate with those of spheroids of their host galaxies .",
    "first , the estimated mass of a smbh in a galactic center , @xmath14 , is roughly proportional to the mass of the spheroid , @xmath15 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath16 is @xmath17 in each galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "second , the mass of a smbh correlates with the velocity dispersion of stars in the spheroid , @xmath18 , as @xmath19 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these relations suggest that the formation of smbhs physically links to the formation of spheroids that harbor the smbhs .    in order to study the formation and evolution of smbhs ,",
    "it is necessary to construct a model that includes galaxy formation and merger processes .",
    "it has become widely accepted that quasars are fueled by accretion of gas onto smbhs in the nuclei of host galaxies .",

    "cluster gravitationally and merge together . in each of merged dark halos , a galaxy is formed as a result of radiative gas cooling , star formation , and supernova feedback .",
    "several galaxies in a common dark halo sometimes merge together and a more massive galaxy is assembled .",
    "when galaxies merge , smbhs in the centers of the galaxies sink toward the center of the new merged galaxy and form a smbh binary subsequently . if the binary loses enough energy and angular momentum , it will evolve to the gravitational wave emitting regime and begin inspiraling , eventually coalesces with a gravitational wave burst .",
    "an ensemble of gravitational waves from a number of inspiraling smbh binaries at different redshift can be observed as a stochastic background at frequencies @xmath20 , which can be detected by pulsar timing measurements @xcite .",

    "future space interferometers such as the laser interferometer space antenna _ lisa _ might detect quasi - monochromatic wave sources associated with inspiraling smbh binaries and gravitational wave bursts associated with smbh binary coalescence .    in order to estimate the feasibility of detecting such gravitational waves , we need to know the smbh coalescing rate that depends on the complex physical processes before coalescence .",
    "a possible scenario of forming smbhs consists of four stages : first , a seed massive black hole in the center of a galaxy grows to an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) via run - away collapse in a dense star cluster @xcite .",
    "second , a galaxy that contains an imbh in their center merges with another galaxy with an imbh .",

    "because smbh formation process is relevant to spheroids of host galaxies rather than to dark halos , we need to evaluate how the baryonic gas processes such as star formation and radiative cooling affect the smbh coalescence rate .    in this paper",
    ", we estimate the smbh coalescence rate using a new semi - analytic ( sa ) model of @xcite ( an extended model of @xcite ) in which the smbh formation is incorporated into the galaxy formation .",

    "the highest redshift in each merging path which depends on the present dark halo mass , is about @xmath32 .",
    "next , in each merging path of dark halos , we calculate the evolution of the baryonic component from higher redshifts to the present .",
    "if a dark halo has no progenitor halos , the mass fraction of the gas in the halo is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the baryonic density parameter .",
    "here we use @xmath35 .",
    "when a dark halo collapses , the gas in the halo is shock - heated to the virial temperature of the halo ( the _ hot gas _ ) . at the same time , the gas in dense regions of the halo cools owing to efficient radiative cooling and sinks to the center of the halo and settle into a rotationally supported disk until the subsequent collapse of the dark halo .",

    "we identify the central galaxy in the new common halo with the central galaxy contained in the most massive progenitor halos .",

    "these galaxies merge by either dynamical friction or random collision .",
    "satellite galaxies merge with the central galaxy owing to dynamical friction in the following time scale , @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the radius and the circular velocity of the new common halo , respectively , @xmath49 is the coulomb logarithm , and @xmath50 is the mass of the satellite galaxy including its dark halo @xcite . when the time passing after a galaxy became a satellite exceeds @xmath51 , the satellite galaxy infalls onto the central galaxy . on the other hand ,",

    "the update of @xmath71 and @xmath34 causes only a slight change of @xmath70 and we have confirmed that the modification hardly affects our results . using this sa model , we can estimate the galaxy merger rate at each redshift .",
    "let us briefly summarize the growth model of smbhs introduced by @xcite . in this model",
    ", it is assumed that smbhs grow by coalescence when their host galaxies merge and are fueled by accreted cold gas during major mergers of galaxies .",
    "when the host galaxies merge , pre - existing smbhs sink to the center of the new merged galaxy due to dynamical friction ( or other mechanisms such as gas dynamics ) , evolve to the gravitational wave emission regime and eventually coalesce .",
    "although the timescale for this process is unknown , for the sake of simplicity we assume that smbhs instantaneously evolve to the gravitational wave emission regime and coalesce .",
    "gas - dynamical simulations have demonstrated that the major merger of galaxies can drive substantial gaseous inflows and trigger starburst activity ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to assume that during a major merger of galaxies , a certain fraction of the cold gas that is proportional to the total mass of stars newly formed at starburst accretes onto the newly formed smbh and this accretion process leads to a quasar activity . under this assumption , the mass of cold gas accreted on a smbh is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a constant and @xmath74 is the total mass of stars formed at starburst .",
    "the free parameter of @xmath73 is fixed by matching the observed relation between a spheroid mass and a black hole mass @xmath75 ( e.g. @xcite ) ; we find that the favorable value of @xmath73 is nearly @xmath76 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the model prediction of the growth rate of the averaged smbh mass , @xmath77 .",
    "we define the averaged smbh mass growth rate as follows , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the mass increase rate of smbh with @xmath80 at @xmath31 , and @xmath81 is the black hole mass function .",
    "@xmath82 is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the mass increment due to smbh binaries coalescence ( the mass of smaller smbh ) .",
    "this figure shows the smbh mass growth is mostly due to gas accretion and does not depend on initial seed masses . at lower redshift ( @xmath85 ) , since the cold gas is depleted by star formation , the smbh coalescence becomes a dominant process of the smbh mass growth .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] ( a ) shows the black hole mass functions in our model at a series of various redshifts .",
    "this indicates that the number density of the most massive black holes increases monotonically with time in our scenario in which smbhs grow by an accretion of cold gas and by coalescence . in this figure",
    ", we superpose the black hole mass function at @xmath86 obtained by @xcite .",
    "the present mass function in our model is quite consistent with the observation .",
    "our galaxy formation model includes dynamical friction and random collision as galaxy merging mechanisms . for comparison , in figure [ fig2 ] ( b )",
    ", we also plot the black hole mass functions at @xmath86 of other two models : no random collision model ( no rc model ) and no dynamical friction model ( no df model ) . in the no rc model and the no df model , mergers owing to random collision and dynamical friction",
    "are switched off , respectively .",
    "this figure shows that the mass function for low mass black holes are determined by random collisions between satellite galaxies and that for high mass black holes are influenced by dynamical friction .",
    "the shape of black hole mass function depends on detailed gas processes .",
    "the important contribution of mass increment of smbhs in central galaxies is the cold gas , which is accreted to only central galaxies .",
    "sne feedback removes this cold gas more efficiently in smaller galaxies with @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "thus , the growth of the smbhs in small central galaxies suffers from sne feedback . in the",
    "no rc model , smbhs mainly exist central galaxies .",
    "therefore , the shape of the black hole mass function in the no rc model has a bump at high mass end ( @xmath89 ) which corresponds to smbhs in the central galaxies ( @xmath90 ) . on the other hand , in the no df model ,",
    "high mass smbhs can not be produced since galaxies can not merge with the massive central galaxy .",
    "@xcite investigated environments and clustering properties of quasars using this sa model which can also reproduce quasar luminosity functions at different redshifts . while our approach is similar to @xcite , their star formation and feedback models are different from ours and their model does not include the random collision process . therefore , their resultant model description differs from ours in equation ( [ eq : bhaccret ] ) . using the sa model incorporated with this smbh growth model , we estimate the comoving number density , @xmath91 , of the coalescing smbh binaries with mass @xmath92 and @xmath93 at @xmath31 in a given redshift interval @xmath94 .",
    "it is difficult to know how smbh binaries manage to shrink to a gravitational wave emission regime after their host galaxies merge , because all physical processes and conditions related to this problem are still not clear ( dynamical friction , stellar distribution , triplet smbh interaction , gas dynamical effects and so on ) .",

    "* ) . in what follows",
    ", we assume that smbhs coalesce simultaneously when host galaxies merge for simplicity .",
    "in other words , the efficiency of smbh coalescence is assumed to be maximum .",
    "note that @xcite constructed a smbh growth model in which the merging history of dark halos with smbhs in their center is derived from cosmological monte - carlo simulations .",
    "although they incorporated dynamical evolution of smbh binaries and triplet smbh interactions into their model , no galaxy formation process is taken into account .",
    "in order to calculate the spectrum of gravitational wave background radiation from smbh binaries , it is necessary to follow the orbit evolution of each binary .",
    "however , it is difficult to set initial conditions . to avoid this problem",
    ", we adopt a formulation by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we start calculation of the expected amplitude of gravitational radiation emitted by a binary .",

    "we assume that the binary orbit is quasi - stationary ( i.e. phase evolution time scale is less than @xmath117 ) until the radius equals to @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the schwarzschild radius : the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) for a particle and a non - rotating black hole .",

    "in this paper , we have estimated the coalescence rate of supermassive black hole ( smbh ) binaries in the centers of galaxies using a new semi - analytic model of galaxy and quasar formation ( sa model ) given by @xcite based on the hierarchical structure formation scenario .",
    "then , we calculated the spectrum of the gravitational wave background from inspiraling smbh binaries based on the formulation given by @xcite and estimated the expected amplitudes and event rates of intense bursts of gravitational waves from coalescing smbh binaries .",
    "our sa model includes dynamical friction and random collision as galaxy merging mechanisms , and assumes that a smbh is fueled by accretion of cold gas during a major merger of galaxies leading to a spheroid formation , and that smbhs coalesce simultaneously when host galaxies merge .",
    "many previous other studies have paid attention to only smbh growth and did not take galaxy formation processes into account . for investigating",
    "the relations between smbh growth and galaxy formation processes , sa methods of galaxy and smbh formation are suitable tools @xcite .",
    "our sa model can reproduce not only observational properties of galaxies , but also the present smbh mass function and the quasar luminosity functions at different redshifts @xcite .",
    "we have found that the gravitational wave background radiation spectrum for @xmath1 has a characteristic strain @xmath0 just below the detection limit from the current measurements of the pulsar timing .",
    "the slope of the spectrum for @xmath183 gets steep owing to the upper limit in frequency set by the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit .",
    "the stochastic background radiation mainly comes from inspiraling smbh binaries at @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the background radiation can probe inspiraling smbh binaries at low redshift .",
    "we have also found that _",

    "our model predicts that burst signals with a large amplitude correspond to coalescence of large mass smbh binaries at low redshift while those with a small amplitude correspond to coalescence of small mass smbh binaries at high redshift .",
