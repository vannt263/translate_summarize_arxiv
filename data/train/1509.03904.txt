    "the study of spreading processes on complex networks has recently gained a massive surge of interest . with the wide range of applications including the spreading of a computer virus , how a product is adopted by a marketplace , or how an idea or belief is propagated through a social network , it is no surprise that a plethora of different models and studies have been devoted to this . however , an overwhelming majority of the stochastic models proposed and studied assume that transitions from one state to another ( e.g. , a healthy individual recovering from a disease ) is a poisson process that follows an exponential distribution .",
    "unfortunately , this simplifying assumption restricts the applicability of such models to exclude a number of specific processes like how information is disseminated through twitter or how the ebola virus is spreading in west africa .    in this paper",
    "we propose a very general class of epidemic models and show how it can be used to study spreading processes that do nt necessarily evolve according to an exponential distribution .",
    "in addition to being able to account for non - poisson spreading processes , our model generalizes almost every model studied in the literature including the mseiv , mseir , mseis , seiv , seir , seis , siv , sirs , sir , and sis models .",
    "the development and analysis of such a general model also allows rapid prototyping of future spreading processes that might not even exist today .",
    "one of the oldest and most commonly studied spreading models is the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model  @xcite .",
    "early works such as the one above often consider simplistic assumptions such as all individuals in a population being equally likely to interact with everyone else in the population  @xcite .",
    "one of the first works to consider a continuous - time sis model over arbitrary contact graphs using mean field theory is  @xcite , which provides conditions on when the disease - free state of the system is globally asymptotically stable .",
    "in addition to the simple sis model , a myriad of different models have also been proposed and studied in the literature . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors add various states to model how humans might adapt their behavior when given knowledge about the possibility of an emerging epidemic .",
    "the work  @xcite considers the possible effect of human behavior changes for the three state susceptible - alert - infected - susceptible ( sais ) model . in  @xcite ,",
    "a four - state generalized susceptible - exposed - infected - vigilant ( g - seiv ) model is proposed and studied .",
    "this model is appealing because it was shown to generalize a large number of other models already studied in the literature  @xcite .",
    "these models have been used to study the propagation of computer viruses  @xcite or products and information  @xcite , and of course the spreading of diseases  @xcite . however",
    ", a large drawback is that _ all _ of the works above consider an underlying markov process that drives the system .",
    "while this may be well suited for a number of spreading processes , they have also been applied in areas for which this is not a very good approximation .",
    "a notable example is the spreading of the ebola virus .",
    "the work  @xcite looks at the spreading of ebola in congo and uganda in 2004 and estimates the spreading properties of the virus fitted to a four - state seir model .",
    "similarly , the work  @xcite looks at the more recent outbreak of ebola in west africa and again estimates the parameters of the virus fitted to a six - state model .",
    "the larger number of states allows the model to better capture things like human behavioral changes and also the incubation period of the ebola virus .",
    "however , just like all the works mentioned above , all transitions are assumed to evolve according to an exponential distribution .",
    "more specifically , once an individual is exposed to the virus at some time @xmath1 , the probability that the individual has started showing symptoms by time @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 for some @xmath4 .",
    "however , this is far from a good approximation when looking at the empirical data collected over the years . the work  @xcite studies a certain strain ( zaire ) of the ebola virus and concludes that the incubation period of the disease is much better modelled as a log - normal distribution with a mean of 12.7 days and standard deviation of 4.31 days , which can not be well captured by the exponential distribution above .",
    "another prominent example today is the spreading of information through social networks on the internet , such as twitter or digg .",
    "it has been observed multiple times that the spreading of information in these networks is again better modelled as a log - normal distribution rather than an exponential one  @xcite .",
    "we are only aware of very few works that have considered spreading processes without exponential distributions . the work  @xcite studies the drastic effects that non - exponential distributions can have both on the speed of the spreading and on the threshold conditions for when the disease will die out or persist .",
    "a simple si model is studied in  @xcite without the complexity of an arbitrary graph structure . the sis model with general infection and recovery times",
    "is considered in  @xcite . in this work",
    "we generalize this idea to a much wider class of epidemic models .",
    "the contributions of this paper are threefold .",
    "first , we propose the @xmath0 model that generalizes a very large number of models studied in the literature today .",
    "our model allows an arbitrary number of ` infected ' and ` vigilant ' states unlike many models that have a fixed number of states .",
    "multiple infected states allows us to capture various stages of a disease or spreading process which may have very different properties in terms of contagiousness , chance of recovery , etc .",
    "multiple vigilant states allows us to capture different reasons that an individual might not be susceptible to a disease including behavioral changes , vaccinations , or even death .",
    "second , we develop and analyze the deterministic mean - field approximation for the model and provide conditions for which the disease - free states of our model are globally asymptotically stable .",
    "finally , we show how allowing our markov model to have an arbitrary number of states can be used to approximate non - poisson spreading processes with arbitrary accuracy .",
    "this allows us to much more accurately describe real - life phenomena , such as the propagation of information through social networks or spreading of the ebola virus , which have recently been shown to evolve according to log - normal distributions rather than exponential ones .",
    "we begin in section  [ se : prelim ] by reviewing some preliminary concepts that will be useful in the remainder of the paper .",
    "we develop our proposed @xmath0 model in section  [ se : model ] and analyze its stability properties in section  [ se : analysis ] . in section  [ se : phase ] we show how our general class of models can be used to model many stochastic spreading processes with state transition times that do not obey an exponential distribution .",
    "we demonstrate the efficacy of our model and validate our stability results through simulations of the spreading of the ebola virus in section  [ se : simulations ] .",
    "finally , we gather our concluding remarks and ideas for future work in section  [ se : conclusions ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath5 and @xmath6 the sets of real and nonnegative real numbers , respectively .",

    ", we build on a compartmental model studied in  @xcite in which the number of states relating to the disease are arbitrary . unlike the population model ( i.e. , no graph structure ) studied in  @xcite , we are interested in proposing and analyzing this model applied to arbitrary networks . in section  [ se : phase ] we show how this model can be used to approximate a wide class of spreading processes on networks for _ any _ type of state transitions with arbitrary accuracy , rather than only poisson processes ( exponential distributions ) .",
