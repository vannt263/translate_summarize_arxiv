    "the study of the fundamental or constituent blocks of matter has been for long time a fascinating field in physics . with the pass of the years",
    "new fundamental blocks or particles have appeared , modifying old concepts .",
    "for example the atom , that was initially supposed to be fundamental , was found to be formed by the nucleus and electrons , the nucleus was found to be formed by neutrons and protons ( nucleons ) and finally the nucleons to be formed by quarks .",
    "nowadays it is believed that the theory describing the interactions between fundamental particles is the standard model .",
    "this model has a @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath1 component is what is called quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and it is the gauge field theory describing the strong interactions of quarks and gluons .",
    "the @xmath2 component is called standard electroweak model describing interactions between quarks and leptons through the @xmath3 bosons and the photons .",
    "there is an additional particle in the electroweak model , the neutral higgs scalar that appears after the spontaneously symmetry breaking mechanism , whose existence has not been probed experimentally and that is a subject of a lot of present experimental research because it could prove the validity of the theory",
    ".    we will be interested in the present paper in the low energy region of the qcd theory , in which quarks interact strongly to form bound states known as hadrons .",
    "when these bound states are formed by a quark and an antiquark ( @xmath4 ) they are called mesons ; and when they are formed by 3-quark states ( @xmath5 ) they are called baryons .",
    "the study of the hadron spectra is a fundamental and open field in theoretical physics . up to the moment",
    "the more important approaches to this subject have been : lattice qcd , qcd sum rules and potential models .",
    "lattice qcd is the most fundamental approach and together with qcd sum rules have had good success .",
    "potential models , although less fundamentals , have proved to be very useful even in non - relativistic approximations . since the latest seventies a lot of attempts have been made in this field with very good results @xcite .",
    "an important question for the use of potential models is whether it is possible to consider hadrons as non - relativistic bound states of quarks .",
    "this question could be answered solving the schrodinger equation assuming a @xmath4 potential and then checking if the obtained quark velocities are non - relativistic . for the charmonium system",
    "this was done in ref.@xcite and it was obtained a result of @xmath6 in the ground state . for lighter hadrons",
    "the results are no so good and the validity of the non - relativistic approximation depends strongly from the interaction potential chosen .",
    "for example , the interaction potential proposed by de rujula , georgi and glashow @xcite was shown @xcite to be unsuitable for dynamical non - relativistic calculations of light hadrons",
    ". however , martin showed latter @xcite that a non - relativistic model with a power law potential is able to describe heavy quark mesons and the clearly relativistic @xmath7 states .",
    "the potential proposed by martin had the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the study of baryon systems with this power law potential was done by richard @xcite obtaining good results . at that time",
    "the baryon spectra in potential models , although rather elaborated @xcite , was completely disconnected from the meson sector .",
    "exceptions were some attempts to derive meson and baryon potential energies from a common framework as the instanton , string or bag model .",
    "the rule adopted by richard for the @xmath12 potential was @xmath13    other very well known phenomenological non - relativistic potential models have been based in the cornel potential @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ; and the logarithmic potential @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "finally , other two propositions of inter - quark potentials are due to song and ling @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; and turin @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "studies with phenomenological potentials , like the cornell one , but considering a relativistic kinetic energy term , are able to describe the observed spectra of heavy and light hadron systems @xcite . non - trivial connections between these relativistic potential models and rigorous numerical results from lattice qcd have been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "some recent works have tried to understand why the non - relativistic treatment works and allows useful predictions even for relativistic systems @xcite .    in the previously mentioned potential models ,",
    "central conditions have been the flavor independence of the potential chosen and the existence of a confining term .",
    "quark masses appearing in these phenomenological models are the so called constituent quark masses that should not be confused with the current quark masses , that are the mass parameters appearing in the qcd lagrangian .",
    "constituent quark masses are bigger than current quark masses and it is suppose that this is due to gluonic condensate effects . in general constituent quark masses",
    "are considered as free parameters to fit in potential models , that is why different values are found all over the literature .",
    "up to our knowledge there are two works in which constituent quark masses are calculated from qcd : one is due to elias et al .",
    "@xcite that used an operator - product expansion ( ope ) of approximate non - perturbative vacuum expectation values in the fixed - point gauge ; the other work is due to cabo and rigol @xcite in which a modified perturbative qcd expansion incorporating gluon condensation was employed @xcite . because there are no free quarks , a lot of care",
    "should be taken with the meaning of these quark masses .    in the present work we study the hadron spectra within a non - relativistic spin - independent phenomenological model , with a harmonic confining potential",
    "the idea is to show with an educational perspective what can be done with the schrodinger equation , the very useful for physicists harmonic potential , and the same number of parameters used in almost all the calculations , in order to understand the hadron spectroscopy .",
    "the harmonic potential has the great advantage that allowed us to obtain analytical solutions for both the meson and baryon ( with equal constituent quarks ) spectra .",
    "although the obtained results are not as good as the ones obtained for the former potentials , we think that they give very good estimates of the hadron properties without the need of numerical calculations implemented for all the previously mentioned potentials .",
    "as we will work with a spin independent model , the magnitudes we will deal with will be spin averaged . for fitting our parameters",
    "spin averages of experimental values were calculated , but for certain resonances the experimental values were not at hand @xcite and theoretical results obtained by fulcher @xcite were used . it should be mentioned that in a work by hirata et al .",
    "@xcite the harmonic oscillator was employed as an unperturbed confinement potential , in the asymptotically free colored - quark - gluon model in which the one - gluon - exchange force was treated perturbatively .",
    "later ram and hasala @xcite used the pure harmonic oscillator potential in the klein - gordon equation to determine the meson masses .    the exposition will be organized as follows . in section",
    "[ 2 ] meson spectra is calculated for two different potentials with harmonic confining terms , that allowed to obtain analytical solutions .",
    "the first potential is the harmonic oscillator and the second one is the harmonic oscillator plus a term proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "the results are analyzed for the flavor dependent and independent cases . in section",
    "[ 3 ] we study the properties of the radial wave function , and some related physical quantities , at the origin . section [ 4 ] is devoted to the study of the baryon spectra and the summary can be found in section 5 .",
    "finally , an appendix was introduced for mathematical details of the three - body problem solution .",
    "in the present section , the non - relativistic meson spectra are calculated for two different potentials .",
    "the first one is the pure harmonic potential and in the second one a term proportional to @xmath28 is added to the harmonic oscillator , allowing to improve the short - range interaction .",
    "that is the potentials considered are : @xmath29 and @xmath30    the schrodinger equation , in the center - of - mass ( cm ) system and in spherical coordinates , has the form ( notation @xmath31 is considered ) @xmath32   \\right\\ }   -\\left ( e_{i}-v_{i}\\right ) \\right\\ } \\psi _ { i}\\left ( r,\\theta , \\phi   \\right)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the reduced mass . introducing the spherical harmonics @xmath35 the radial schrodinger equation can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37    the solution of eq .",
    "( [ schr2 ] ) can be found in any classical textbook of quantum mechanics @xcite and has the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 @xmath40 is a normalization factor and @xmath41 is the confluent hyper - geometric function .",
    "the eigenvalues of the energy are @xmath42    first , in order to compare with experimental values we fitted the parameters without imposing the flavor independence condition on the potentials . for that case",
    "@xcite it is only possible to determine from the experimental spectra the values of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 that are shown in table [ tab1 ] for charmonium ( @xmath46 ) and upsilon ( @xmath47 ) systems . as it can be seen , the parameter @xmath48 has the limiting value for the existence of the solution for the flavor dependent ( fd ) potential @xmath49 for both quark systems , because @xmath50 and for @xmath51 and @xmath52 the squared root will have imaginary values .",
    ".parameters obtained for the @xmath46 and @xmath47 systems with the flavor dependent potential . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as it can be seen the theoretical results obtained are only estimates for the experimental values",
    ". the main differences between these theoretical results and the experimental ones , or other theoretical calculations , are clearly due to the non - singularity of the potential at the origin , and its concavity .",
    "that is , the harmonic potential has positive second derivative at variance with other proposed potentials that vary more slowly with the distance .",
    "this causes that when the energy of a state increases , the classical allowed region will be smaller for the harmonic potential than for the other ones and states result more localized .",
    "other undesirable effects are the constant spacing between the consecutive levels and the degeneracy present .",
    "the differences between the proposed potential and the former ones also cause the so called constituent quarks masses to be here like twice of the usual values for the heavy quarks @xmath53 , @xmath54 and fifth times for the @xmath55 quarks .",
    "the addition of the non harmonic term improved the results for the lower levels and broke the degeneracy present , but for the higher excited states the deficiencies remain ; and this potential was also unable to fit with the flavor independence condition .",
    "as it was mentioned in the previous section , the major reason for differences between our calculation for the pure harmonic oscillator and previous ones are the non - singularity of the potential at the origin , and its concavity . the value of the radial wave function or its first non - vanishing derivative at the origin @xmath56 is needed for the evaluation of pseudo - scalar decay constants and production rates through heavy - quark fragmentation @xcite . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we compare our results for @xmath57 with the ones presented for other potentials in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath58 mesons .    ) for @xmath58 mesons . ]",
    "two interesting magnitudes to evaluate , related with the wave functions at the origin , are the leptonic widths and the hyperfine splitting .",
    "leptonic widths for charmonium and upsilon systems are presented in figure [ fig3 ] and compared with results in ref .",
    "they were obtained by the formula @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 ( number of colors ) , @xmath61 denotes the fine structure constant , @xmath62 denotes the quark charge and @xmath63 is the mass of the vector meson .    ) . ]",
    "finally , the hyperfine splitting can be obtained through the expression @xcite    @xmath64    in which the constant is fixed through the hyperfine splitting observed in the charmonium family @xmath65 results for the @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 resonances are shown in figure [ fig4 ] .    ) . ]",
    "in the present section we study the baryon spectra using the harmonic potential obtained in section [ 2 ] . for the three - body system",
    "the hamiltonian has the form @xmath69    in order to separate the c - m motion , we define the jacobi ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) and c - m ( @xmath72 ) coordinates through @xmath73   ^{\\frac{1}{4}}\\left (   \\overrightarrow{r_{b}}-\\overrightarrow{r_{c}}\\right),\\nonumber \\\\ \\overrightarrow{r } & = & \\left [ \\frac{\\mu _ { a , bc}}{\\mu _ { bc}}\\right ]   ^{\\frac{1}{4}}\\left ( \\overrightarrow{r_{a}}-\\frac{m_{b } \\overrightarrow{r_{b}}+m_{c}\\overrightarrow{r_{c}}}{m_{b}+m_{c}}\\right),\\nonumber   \\\\ \\overrightarrow{r}_{cm } & = & \\frac{m_{a}\\overrightarrow{r_{a}}+m_{b } \\overrightarrow{r_{b}}+m_{c}\\overrightarrow{r_{c}}}{m},\\label{jacobi1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 considering equal masses @xmath75 , and eqs .",

    "but then the energy eigenvalues will not be in terms of the natural quantum numbers of the system , and it will not be possible a check with experimental or other theoretical results .",
    "the same problem is faced with the usual 3-dimensional harmonic oscillator , which could be solved in cartesian coordinates as the sum of three independent 1-dimensional harmonic oscillators , but then no relation between the conserved angular momentum and the energy spectrum is obtained and the use of spherical coordinates is convenient .    then introducing the hyper - spherical coordinates @xcite ( see appendix [ a ] ) @xmath78 the kinetic term stay in a diagonal form and the potential become only dependent of the hyper - radio , then the hamiltonian ( [ h2 ] ) takes the form @xmath79 \\nonumber \\\\   &   & + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}k\\left(\\rho^{2}\\right )   + \\frac{3}{2}w_{0},\\label{h3 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath80 is the angular momentum of the subsystem @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the angular momentum of particle @xmath83 respect to the c - m of the two body subsystem @xmath81 .",

    "the calculation of the meson and baryon spectra , and the hyperfine splitting with this potential give good estimates of the experimental and other theoretical results ; in the case of leptonic widths we could say that the results are not good .",
    "although this potential is far from being a good approximation for the real inter - quark potential , and the results are not as good as the theoretically obtained by other phenomenological models , it has the great advantage that allows to obtain analytical solutions for both meson and baryon spectra .",
    "that is , reasonable theoretical results are obtained without the need of numerical methods and computational calculations .",
    "the major differences of this potential and the others mentioned in the introduction are due to its non - singularity at the origin and its concavity , that cause the bad results for the obtained leptonic widths and also ( for a better fit with experiments ) the so called constituent masses to be bigger than the usual ones .",
    "the baryon spectra was studied with the use of the rule ( [ rich ] ) for the @xmath12 potential and for obtaining the analytical solution it was necessary to restrict the study to equal constituent quark systems .",
