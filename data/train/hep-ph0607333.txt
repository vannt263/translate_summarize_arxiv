    "to establish our understanding on the origin of the mass of elementary particles is the top priority for today s high energy physics .",
    "the idea of spontaneous breakdown of the electroweak gauge symmetry provides a simple and compelling phenomenological picture for this issue in the standard model ( sm ) and its extended versions .",
    "the masses of weak gauge bosons are generated by the higgs mechanism , and those of quarks and charged leptons are given via the yukawa interaction after the symmetry breaking .    in the sm a scalar iso - doublet field , the higgs field ,",
    "is introduced to trigger the spontaneous symmetry breaking , whose energy density determines the structure of vacuum .",
    "it is a remarkable feature of the sm that all the massive elementary particles but neutrinos obtain masses which are proportional to the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field .",
    "the scale for the mass of each particle is determined by the magnitude of its coupling with the higgs boson . in the sm , therefore , hierarchical structure among quark masses observed at experiments is a consequence of differences in the strength of the yukawa interaction for each quark . as a result",
    "the question of the quark mass hierarchy remains a problem , which must be solved in the framework of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the top quark is exceptionally heavy as compared to the other quarks .",
    "its mass has been measured to be at the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking , so that its yukawa coupling has turned out to be of order one within the sm .",
    "this fact would indicate an important insight that the top quark is deeply related to dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "there have been lots of works in this direction ; the idea of the top mode condensation and top color models@xcite , top flavor models@xcite etc .",
    "these models generally predict rather strong dynamics for the electroweak symmetry breaking . measuring the interaction between the higgs boson and the top quark is essentially important not only to confirm the sm but also to test new physics including these models .    at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , which will start its operation in 2007 ,",
    "it is strongly expected that the higgs boson will be discovered in a wide range of its mass up to 1 tev@xcite .",
    "once the higgs boson is found , its property such as the mass , the width , production cross sections and decay branching ratios will be measured as precisely as possible for the purpose of testing the sm and its extensions .",
    "information of higgs coupling constants with fermions can be extracted from these observables .",
    "however , measurement of the top yukawa coupling may be challenging due to the huge qcd backgrounds .",
    "precise determination of the coupling constants can be performed at the international linear collider ( ilc)@xcite . at the ilc",

    ", it can be measured via the vector boson fusion process @xmath2@xcite .",
    "impact of non - standard interactions on the coupling of the top quark with the higgs boson is of central interest in this paper .",
    "below the new physics scale ( i.e. , the cutoff scale of the sm ) , such a new interaction is effectively described in terms of higher dimensional operators after the heavy new physics particles are integrated out .",
    "in particular , the low energy effect of new physics is expressed at the leading order by dimension - six operators in a gauge invariant lagrangian .",

    "have investigated the same process in the context of the sm without the higgs boson , instead including the dimension - five operators @xmath4 and @xmath5@xcite . in the present paper , we keep the higgs boson mass to be the electroweak scale , and classify the non - standard interaction between the higgs boson and the top quark in terms of the dimension - six operators with setting the cutoff scale to be tev scales .",
    "we find that the effect of the dimension - six operators with the cutoff scale to be a tev region can enhance the cross section significantly especially for relatively large higgs boson masses , so that the effect should be detectable at the ilc .",

    "@xcite , the simulation study for the background reduction has been done in the sm , and it is concluded that the background can be sufficiently suppressed by the kinematic cuts .",
    "another important background is the top pair production process via the photon fusion @xmath180 .",
    "this mode can be suppressed by the cut @xmath181 gev@xcite , where @xmath182 is the missing energy . finally , the direct top - pair production @xmath183 can easily be suppressed by imposing the cut for the invariant mass @xmath184 .    we have mainly shown the results with the possible maximal values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "for smaller values of these couplings , the effect becomes reduced according to the size of the couplings . in such a case ,",
    "the helicity analysis of the final top ( anti - top ) quark would make it possible to discriminate the contribution from the higgs boson mediated diagram .",
    "the systematic analysis along this line will be performed for these intermediate regions of the higgs boson mass in our future publications@xcite . finally ,",
    "in this paper we have concentrated on the process at @xmath176 colliders , and we have found that a deviation from the sm result can be a few times 100 % greater than the sm prediction , which can easily be detectable at a linear collider",
    ". such a large deviation may also be detectable at hadron colliders via the process such as @xmath185 even though the qcd background is huge .",
    "we may also consider a similar process such as @xmath186 . in any case",
    ", detailed simulation study should be necessary to clarify the significance .",
    "in the low energy effective theory , information of the dynamics of mass generation is described by higher dimensional operators which affect the sm top yukawa coupling .",
    "we have discussed the effect of non - standard interactions characterized by dimension - six operators on the effective top yukawa coupling .",
    "we have evaluated the effects of the dimension - six operators @xmath83 and @xmath48 on the cross section for the process @xmath187 .",
    "the magnitude of the coefficients of these dimension - six operators are constrained by perturbative unitarity and current experimental data .",
    "we then studied possible deviation from the sm prediction in these cross sections .",
    "we have found that the effect of the dimension - six operator @xmath83 can enhance the cross section by a few times 100% for heavy higgs bosons ( @xmath188 ) when the new physics scale @xmath7 is in a tev region .",
    "such a large deviation from the sm prediction should be detectable at the ilc and the clic .",
    "the detailed study for a higgs boson with an intermediate mass ( @xmath189 ) by including helicity analysis for the final top quarks will be presented elsewhere .",
