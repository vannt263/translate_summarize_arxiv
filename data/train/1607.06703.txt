    "is not understood . in both examples , elastic interactions between gbs and",
    "precipitates might play a central role in the development of these microstructures .",
    "however , these interactions remain largely unexplored due to the complexity of the problem at hand that involves elastic interactions , grain boundary migration , and solute diffusion .    in a recent study @xcite",
    ", we provided further insight into the complex interaction between crystal defects and precipitates by investigating the situation in which a planar gb is centered inside a misfitting lamellar precipitate ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlinear].a ) .",
    "this choice of geometry is physically motivated by the fact that dislocations act as preferred sites of nucleation @xcite .",
    "hence gbs naturally seed the formation of lamellar precipitates of this approximate geometry @xcite . using a nonlinear elastic model @xcite and amplitude equations ( ae ) that describe the interaction between composition and stress @xcite , we showed that this configuration is morphologically unstable .",
    "this instability is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlinear].b - e that shows a sequence of gb and precipitate configurations obtained by ae simulations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we carried out a linear stability analysis to predict the onset and wavelength of this instability .",
    "the starting point of this analysis is a free - boundary problem governing the coupled evolution of dbs and gbs , which corresponds to the sharp - interface limit of the ae model ( i.e. the limit where the dbs and gb can be treated as sharp boundaries ) .",
    "the physical mechanism of this instability can be qualitatively understood by considering a small initial sinusoidal perturbation of dbs of wavelength @xmath11 . in the case of isotropic",
    "elasticity , the elastic energy is unchanged by this perturbation because the bitter - crum theorem @xcite implies that this energy is independent of the shape of the precipitate and only depends on its volume , which remains constant . in the absence of a gb inside the precipitate ,",
    "the db is stable because the perturbation of its interface increases the total db surface , therefore increasing the total energy of the system .",
    "in contrast , with a gb present , the elastic energy can be decreased by the relaxation of the shear stress , induced by the db perturbation , along the gb plane via shear - coupled gb motion @xcite .",
    "namely , the gb can move normal to its plane under an applied shear stress .",
    "this behavior referred as _ coupling _ is characterized by the relation @xmath12 between the velocity @xmath13 of the gb normal to the gb plane and the rate @xmath14 of parallel grain translation . in the case of pure coupling , the coefficient @xmath15 is a geometrical factor depending only on gb bicrystallography with the coupling factor @xmath15 obtained from the geometrical relation between dislocation glide motion and crystal lattice translation @xcite .",
    "computations and experiments have shown that a wide range of both low- and high - angle gbs display shear - coupled motion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , gb coupling has been found to influence significantly the coarsening behavior of polycrystalline materials in more complex multi - grain geometries where gbs form a complex network @xcite .",
    "our recent study @xcite has highlighted the fundamental role of shear - coupled gb motion in the interaction between gbs and precipitates .",
    "however , this study only considered a limited range of misfit strain and gb misorientation and was limited to isotropic elasticity and a lamellar precipitate geometry .",
    "materials forming second phase precipitates are often elastically anisotropic .",
    "this anisotropy is known to influence the shape of misfitting precipitates by inducing dbs to align along preferred crystallographic directions to minimize the elastic energy @xcite .",
    "moreover , it also influences the elastic interaction between gbs and precipitates .",
    "in particular , the bitter - crum theorem @xcite invoked above to explain the destabilization of the gb for isotropic elasticity no longer applies within elastic anisotropy . in this case ,",
    "deformation of the precipitate shape increases the elastic energy and can hinder or even potentially suppress the gb morphological instability . furthermore , in several important experimental situations , precipitates interacting with gbs have a circular or cuboid geometry if nucleation occurs away from the gb at multiple sites , e.g. @xmath10 precipitates in ni - al superalloys .",
    "it is unclear how in those situations , closed - shape precipitates interact with gbs and what role shear - coupled motion plays in this interaction .    in this paper , we extend the study of ref .",
    "[ ] to investigate the interaction between gbs and precipitates of different shapes with and without elastic anisotropy .",
    "we first focus on the lamellar precipitate geometry and extend the linear stability analysis of ref .",
    "[ ] to anisotropic elastic behavior .",
    "this extension is conceptually straightforward even though the anisotropy makes the analysis more lengthy .",
    "the analysis predicts that elastic anisotropy hinders the instability , because of the energetic cost of deforming the lamellar precipitate , but does not suppress it .",
    "we test this prediction using the same ae approach as in refs . [ ] and [ ] , albeit with a free - energy form that favors an elastically anisotropic 3d body - centered - cubic ( bcc ) structure .",
    "the simulation results are in good quantitative agreement with the predictions of the linear stability analysis .",
    "for a free - energy form that favors an elastically isotropic two - dimensional ( 2d ) hexagonal structure , we investigate the nonlinear development of the instability over a wider range of misfit strain and misorientation than in ref .  [ ] .",
    "simulations yield the novel insight that , in a well - developed non - linear regime , this instability can lead to the break - up of low - angle gbs when the misfit strain exceeds a threshold that depends on misorientation .",
    "next , we investigate in 2d the interactions between a circular precipitate and a grain boundary .",
    "we find that a similar elastic interaction mediated by shear - coupled gb motion leads to the attraction of the precipitate to the gb .",
    "the gb and precipitate shape are simultaneously deformed in this process that can also lead to gb break - up for large enough misfit strain .",
    "some properties of the amplitude equations ( ae ) approach relevant to the present study are worth pointing out .",
    "ae models can be generally derived from the phase - field - crystal ( pfc ) model @xcite via a multiscale expansion @xcite .",
    "this expansion is formally valid in the limit where the correlation length of liquid density fluctuations ( which sets of the width of the spatially diffuse solid - liquid interface at the melting point of a pure material ) is much larger than the lattice spacing .",
    "ae models can also be derived in the spirit of ginzburg - landau expansions of a free - energy functional in terms of complex density wave amplitudes from symmetry considerations ( see ref . [ ] and earlier references therein for a comparison of both approaches for solid - liquid interface properties ) .",
    "the latter approach provides more flexibility to formulate ae models with a minimal set of model parameters that can be related to material parameters . for this reason",
    ", it was used in ref .",
    "[ ] to derive the set of aes that describes the interaction of composition , stress , and crystal defects .",
    "the parameters of this ae model , used here and in our previous study @xcite , are uniquely fixed by the db energy @xmath16 , the misfit strain @xmath17 , linear elastic properties , and the dislocation core size that is proportional to the correlation length . like pfc , the ae method describes dislocation glide , therefore reproducing salient features of gb shear - coupled motion for a wide range of gb bi - crystallography @xcite , and also dislocation climb .",
    "since pfc and ae models do not track explicitly the vacancy concentration , the climb kinetics is modeled only heuristically . however , the incorporation of dislocation climb is important in that it provides an additional mechanism to relax the total free - energy as is apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlinear ] where the final equilibrium configuration was attained by a combination of both dislocation glide and climb . finally , as shown in ref .",
    "[ ] , the ae model can only describe gbs over a limited range of misorientation due to the choice of a fixed reference set of crystal axes to represent the crystal density waves . however , this limitation is not too stringent as the method is able to describe both low - angle gbs with separate dislocations and higher angle ones with overlapping dislocation cores .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by introducing in [ sec : ae ] the ae model for both hexagonal ( isotropic elasticity ) and bcc ordering ( anisotropic elasticity ) .",
    "the following [ sec : lsa ] is dedicated to generalizing the linear stability analysis to the case of anisotropic elasticity . in particular , we show that the introduction of elastic anisotropy inhibits the instability by reducing the growth rate and decreasing the range of unstable wavelengths .",
    "next , in [ sec : gbb ] , we investigate more closely the nonlinear regime of instability for isotropic elasticity , showing that a sufficiently large misfit strain can lead to gb break - up . finally , in [ sec : cpg ] , we investigate the interactions between circular precipitates and a gb , showing that similar elastic interaction leads to the attraction of the precipitate to the gb and can also lead to gb break - up .",

    "snapshots of simulations performed with two different misorientation angles @xmath4 and @xmath346 are presented in , respectively .",
    "even though the circular and lamellar precipitate geometries differ significantly , the simulations reveal that the mechanism of the gb instability is similar in both cases .",
    "the gb deforms slightly by shear - coupled motion to relax shear stresses produced by the misfitting particle . in turn",
    ", the deformed gb produces an heterogeneous stress field , inducing the migration of the precipitate towards the gb ( see .a - c and .a - b ) .",
    "this migration is mediated by the elongation of the precipitate .",
    "the additional surface energy caused by this elongation is compensated by the relaxation of shear stresses by the gb coupling mechanism .",
    "therefore , the interplay between the elastic energy and the surface energy lead to the destabilization of the configuration through a mechanism similar to the morphological instability of lamellar precipitates described previously .",
    "eventually , the misfitting particle enters in contact with the gb . for the low angle gb",
    ", the misfit stress is large enough to break - up the gb ( see .d ) , allowing the gb dislocations to relax part of the misfit stress . for the higher angle gb , the precipitate interface wets the gb without leading to its break - up ( see .d ) . in both cases ,",
    "the equilibrium configuration show a slightly elliptic precipitate centered on the somewhat perturbed gb . this configuration relaxes the total energy as shown in .g .    despite a large value of the misfit compared to @xmath10",
    "precipitates in ni - al superalloys , these simulations show that elastic interactions between the misfitting particle and the gb induce a driving force for the migration of the particle , thereby providing a mechanism for how @xmath10 precipitates nucleated in the gb vicinity migrate towards the gb . in the case of an isolated misfitting particle , the shear stress induced along the gb by the particle decays as @xmath347 where @xmath333 and @xmath348 are the particle radius and its initial perpendicular distance to the gb , respectively , and @xmath349 is the dimension of space .",
    "hence , in both two and three dimensions , the gb will be deformed on a scale comparable to @xmath348 .",
    "this deformation will in turn perturb the stress field on a scale @xmath348 , thereby causing the precipitate to migrate at a rate that becomes vanishingly small in the limit @xmath350 . in the case where several particles are present ,",
    "the interaction between particles and gb is more complex .",
    "however , significant migration is generally expected to only occur when a particle is located at a distance from the gb comparable to its size .",
    "in summary , we used the ae framework to investigate computationally the interaction between gbs and second phase precipitates in two - phase coherent solids in the presence of misfit strain .",
    "we focused on two generic geometries where a gb is centered inside a lamellar precipitate formed by heterogeneous nucleation on the gb , and where the gb is adjacent to a circular precipitate that nucleates inside a grain .",
    "we find that , in both geometries , the gb becomes deformed away from its initial planar configuration by a coordinated motion of the gb and the adjacent compositional db(s ) that relaxes the elastic strain energy created by the misfit precipitate .",
    "the motion of the gb is driven by shear stresses along the gb ( shear - coupled motion ) while the motion of the dbs is driven by concentration gradients and controlled by atomic diffusion .",
    "for the lamellar precipitate geometry , the coordinated motion of the gb and dbs is manifested as a pattern - forming instability with a fastest growing wavelength .",
    "this instability bears similarities with the asaro - tiller - grinfeld ( atg ) instability @xcite where destabilization is mediated by the relaxation of the normal stresses at a free surface or a solid - liquid interface .",
    "however , the present instability is more complex in that it involves the interaction of two fundamentally different types of interfaces ( gb and dbs ) .",
    "furthermore , it is mediated by the relaxation of a shear stress at the gb . we have characterized analytically this instability by extending our previous linear stability analysis for isotropic elasticity @xcite to the more complex case of anisotropic elasticity .",
    "the analysis predicts that , if the lamellar precipitate is oriented along an elastically soft direction , elastic anisotropy hinders the instability by reducing the growth rate of the instability and the range of unstable wavelengths .",
    "however , anisotropy does not suppress the instability even though the lamellar precipitate would be stable in this configuration in the absence of misfit .",
    "analytical predictions for the growth rate of perturbations and the range of unstable wavelengths are in good overall quantitative agreement with the results of ae simulations for three - dimensional bcc crystal structures .",
    "for a circular precipitate adjacent to a planar gb , the coordinated motion of the gb and db is manifested by an elongation of the precipitate shape and concomitant migration of the precipitate towards the deformed gb .",
    "the increase of interfacial energy associated with this elongation is compensated by the relaxation of shear stresses by the gb coupling mechanism .",
    "hence , the interplay between elastic and interfacial energy leads to the destabilization of the initial gb - precipitate configuration by a physical mechanism similar to the morphological instability of the gb inside a lamellar precipitate",
    ".    simulations also reveal that , in the lamellar geometry , instability can lead to the break - up of low - angle gbs when the misfit strain exceeds a threshold that depends on the grain boundary misorientation . stationary equilibrium configurations after break - up",
    "can be quite complex and consist of dislocations that reside inside or outside the precipitate and decorate its surface to relax the misfit stress . for the circular precipitate",
    ", gb break - up also occurs for low angle gbs even though the final equilibrium configuration is typically an oval shape precipitate centered on an approximately flat gb , at least for the few cases investigated here . for both the lamellar and circular precipitates , dislocation climb is seen to provide an important mechanism to relax the total free - energy in addition to glide .    the present findings should be relevant for interpreting a host of experiments where gbs interact strongly with precipitates , including the aforementioned examples of ni - al superalloys where @xmath10 precipitates lead to gb serration @xcite and widmansttten precipitates in steel and ti - based alloys , which are observed to grow out in a direction normal to the gb plane @xcite . in the more general",
    "setting of spinodal decomposition occurring in a polycrystalline material , our results suggest that a large difference of lattice spacing between compositional domains could influence significantly the grain structure by the break - up of gbs or the nucleation of new grains ( e.g. ) , thereby affecting the resulting properties of the bulk material . _ in situ _ experimental observations that characterize the interactions between gbs and precipitates in both controlled bi - crystal geometries and complex networks of gbs remain needed to validate more directly the instability mechanisms highlighted in the present study .",
