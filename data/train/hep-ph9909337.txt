    "along with an experimental search for an explanation of electroweak symmetry breaking and a physics beyond the standard model , high energies and luminosities of particle accelerators running or being planned and under construction provide a possibility to observe rare processes with heavy quarks .",
    "a competitive topic here is a study of dynamics in flavored hadrons containing two heavy quarks .",
    "it can play a fundamental role in an extraction of primary parameters of quark interactions , since a distinction between the qcd effects inside the doubly and singly heavy hadrons allows one strictly to constrain incalculable nonperturbative quantities determining the isolation of pure electroweak physics .",
    "the real possibility of such experimental measurements was recently confirmed by cdf collaboration due to the first observation of @xmath2 meson @xcite .",
    "as predicted theoretically @xcite , this long - lived state of @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks has the production cross sections , mass and decay rates , which represent characteristic values for the doubly heavy hadrons .",
    "thus , the experimental search for the doubly heavy baryons can also be successful .",
    "of course , such the search would be more strongly motivated if it would be supported by modern theoretical studies and evaluations of basic characteristics for the doubly heavy baryons .",
    "some steps forward this program were already done .",
    "first , the production cross sections of doubly heavy baryons in hadron collisions at high energies of colliders and in fixed target experiments were calculated in the framework of perturbative qcd for the hard processes and factorization of soft term related to the nonperturbative binding the heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "second , the lifetimes and branching fractions of basic decay modes were evaluated in the operator product expansion combined with the effective theory of heavy quarks , which results in series over the inverse heavy quark masses and relative velocities of heavy quarks inside the doubly heavy diquark @xcite .",
    "third , the families of doubly heavy baryons , which contain a set of narrow excited levels in addition to the basic state , were described in the framework of potential models @xcite , so that the picture of spectra is very similar to that of heavy quarkonia .",
    "fourth , the qcd sum rules @xcite were explored for the two - point baryonic currents in order to calculate the masses and couplings of doubly heavy baryons @xcite .",
    "however , the latter analysis contains some disadvantages , which are related to instability of sum rules in a region of parameters defining the baryonic currents .",
    "this fact leads to quite large uncertainties in the calculations .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze the nrqcd sum rules for the two - point correlators of currents corresponding to the doubly heavy baryons .",
    "the basic physical motivation of such consideration is a nonrelativistic motion of two heavy quarks inside a small size diquark bound with a light quark .",
    "this fact leads to the definite expressions for the structure of baryonic currents written down in terms of nonrelativistic heavy quarks . to the leading order of inverse",
    "heavy quark mass and relative velocity of heavy quarks inside the diquark , the nrqcd sum rules require the account for hard gluon corrections to relate the nonrelativistic heavy quark correlators to the full qcd ones .",
    "the corresponding anomalous dimensions of baryonic currents were calculated with the two - loop accuracy @xcite .",
    "the nrqcd structure of currents corresponds to a definite choice of parameters in the full qcd expressions .",
    "those values of parameters are inside the instability region , observed in the analysis done previously @xcite .",
    "we find the simple physical reason for this loose of convergency : the behaviour of quantities versus the sum rule parameters ( the borel variable or the moment number of spectral density ) is determined by the presence of doubly heavy diquark inside the baryon and , hence , the difference between the masses of baryon and diquark .",
    "this mass difference takes a dominant role unless we introduce the corrections corresponding to the essential nonperturbative interactions between the doubly heavy diquark and the light quark composing the baryon . in nrqcd sum rules",
    "this introduction is realized in terms of nonperturbative condensates caused by higher dimension operators .",
    "we show that the stability of sum rules can be reached due to the account for the product of quark and gluon condensates in addition to the quark , gluon and mixed condensates .",
    "this product was not taken into account in the previous analysis in full qcd .",
    "moreover , we carefully take into account the coulomb - like @xmath5 corrections inside the heavy diquark , which enhances the relative weight of perturbative parts with respect to the condensate terms in the calculated correlators .    in section 2",
    "we define the currents and represent the spectral densities in the nrqcd sum rules for various operators included into the consideration .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the numerical estimates .",
    "we find the masses of basic states , which are close to the values obtained in the potential models .",
    "the results are summarized in conclusion .",
    "the currents of baryons with two heavy quarks @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes various electric charges depending on the flavour of light quark , are associated with the spin - parity quantum numbers @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the heavy diquark system with the symmetric and antisymmetric flavor structure , respectively . adding the light quark to the heavy quark system , one obtains @xmath12 for the @xmath8 baryons and the pair of degenerate states @xmath12 and @xmath13 for the baryons @xmath6 , @xmath14 , @xmath7 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",

    "the effective static field of the heavy quark is denoted by @xmath25 . to the leading order over both the relative velocity of heavy quarks and their inverse masses , this field contains the `` large '' component only in the hadron rest frame .    here , unlike the case of baryons with a single heavy quark @xcite , there is the only independent current component @xmath26 for each of the ground state baryon currents .",

    "the instability results in huge uncertainties of estimates . to get rid this disadvantage",
    ", we analyze the nrqcd sum rules in details .      in this section",
    "we describe steps required for the evaluation of two - point correlation functions in the nrqcd approximation and the connection to physical characteristics of doubly heavy baryons .",
    "we start from the correlator of two baryonic currents with the half spin @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the residual and full momenta of doubly heavy baryon , respectively , @xmath43 is its four - velocity , which are related by the following formula : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the heavy quark masses",
    ". the appropriate definitions of scalar formfactors for the 3/2-spin baryon are given by the following : @xmath47+\\ldots,\\label{2vcor}\\ ] ] where we will not concern for contributions with distinct lorentz structures .",
    "the scalar correlators @xmath48 can be evaluated in deep euclidean region by employing the operator product expansion ( ope ) in the framework of nrqcd for the time ordered product of currents in eqs.([2pcor ] ) , ( [ 2vcor ] ) , say , @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the local operator with a given dimension @xmath51 : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 ,  , and the functions @xmath55 are the corresponding wilson coefficients of ope . in this work",
    "we include the nonperturbative contributions given by quark , gluon and mixed condensates .",
    "so , evaluating the contribution of quark condensate operator , we use the following ope for the correlator of two quark fields @xcite : @xmath56 , \\label{qq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the value of mixed condensate is parameterized by introducing the variable @xmath57 , which is numerically determined as @xmath58 gev@xmath59 .    for the sake of simplicity , we write down the wilson coefficients of unity and quark - gluon operators by making use of dispersion relations over @xmath60 , @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the imaginary part in the physical region of nrqcd . thus , the calculation of wilson coefficients of operators under consideration is transformed into the evaluating the corresponding spectral densities .",
    "to relate the nrqcd correlators to the real hadrons , we use the dispersion representation for the two point function with the physical spectral density , given by the appropriate resonance and continuum part .",
    "the coupling constants of baryons are defined by the following expressions : @xmath63 where the spinor field with four - velocity @xmath64 and mass @xmath65 satisfies the equation @xmath66 , and @xmath67 denotes the transversal spinor , so that @xmath68 .",
    "we suppose that the continuum density , starting from the threshold @xmath69 is equal to that of calculated in the framework of nrqcd .",
    "then in sum rules equalizing the correlators , calculated in nrqcd and given by the physical states , the integrations above @xmath69 cancel each other in two sides of relation .",
    "this fact leads to the dependence of calculated masses and couplings on the value of @xmath70 .",
    "further , we write down the correlators at the deep under - threshold point of @xmath71 with @xmath72 , which corresponds to the limit of @xmath73 .",
    "the approximation of single bound state leads to the following expression for the resonance contribution : latexmath:[\\[f_{1,2}(t)= \\frac{m_{\\xi }    series by the single pole in the physical region over @xmath60 , @xmath75 . ] over @xmath60 .",
    "then , the sum rules state the following equalities for the terms standing in front of powers of @xmath60 @xmath76 where @xmath77 contains the contributions given by various operators in ope for the corresponding scalar correlators @xmath78 . introducing the following notation for @xmath79-th moment of two point correlation function @xmath80",
    "we can obtain the estimates of baryon mass @xmath81 , for example , as the following : @xmath82 = \\frac{{\\cal m}_n}{{\\cal m}_{n + 1}},\\ ] ] and the coupling is determined by the expression @xmath83|^2 = { \\cal m}_n m_{\\xi}^{n + 1},\\ ] ] where we see the dependence of sum rule results on the scheme parameter .",
    "therefore , we tend to find the region of parameter values , where , first , the result is stable under the variation of @xmath79 , and , second , the both correlators @xmath84 and @xmath85 reproduce equal values of physical quantities : masses and couplings .",
    "the problem of full qcd was the second point : the difference between the evaluated variables .",
    "the similar procedure can be described in the borel scheme , wherein the consideration of @xmath86 is replaced by the analysis of function @xmath87 $ ] , which is defined by @xmath88=\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_0^{\\omega_{cont}}{\\rho ( \\omega ) d\\omega } e^{-(\\omega + m_1 + m_2)/w},\\ ] ] equal to the resonance term given by @xmath89= |z_{\\xi}|^2 e^{-m_{\\xi}/w}.\\ ] ] then , again the scheme dependence of masses and couplings appears because of variation versus the borel parameter @xmath90 .      in this subsection we present analytical expressions for the perturbative spectral functions in the nrqcd approximation .",
    "the evaluation of spectral densities involves the standard use of cutkosky rules @xcite with some modifications motivated by nrqcd .",
    "we explore the prescription that the discontinuity of two - point functions under consideration can be evaluated using the following substitutions for heavy and light quark propagators , correspondingly : @xmath91 for the perturbative spectral densities @xmath92 and @xmath93 standing in front of unity operator in @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively , where @xmath94 or @xmath31 , we have the following expressions : @xmath95,\\nonumber\\\\ \\rho_{1,\\xi_{qq}^{\\diamond}}(\\omega ) & = & 3 \\rho_{1,\\xi^{\\prime\\diamond}_{qq^{\\prime}}}(\\omega ) = 3 \\rho_{1,\\xi_{qq}^{*\\diamond}}(\\omega ) , \\label{ss}\\\\ \\rho_{2,\\xi_{qq}^{\\diamond}}(\\omega ) & = & \\rho_{2,\\xi^{\\prime\\diamond}_{qq^{\\prime}}}(\\omega ) = \\rho_{2,\\xi_{qq}^{*\\diamond}}(\\omega)=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in the leading order of theory with the effective heavy quarks their spins are decoupled from the interaction , that causes the spin symmetry relations given in eq.([ss ] ) .",
    "the factor 3 stands because of the normalization of vector diquark current .",
    "we see also that in the leading approximation of perturbative nrqcd the @xmath85 correlators are equal to zero .",
    "this is because the interaction of massless light quark with the doubly heavy diquark is switched off in this order , and there is no mass term structure in the correlator .",
    "the coulomb - like interaction inside the heavy diquark can be taken into account by the introduction of sommerfeld factor @xmath96 for the diquark spectral densities before the integration over the diquark invariant mass to obtain the baryon spectral densities , so that @xmath97 with @xmath98^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath99 denotes the relative velocity of heavy quarks inside the diquark , and we have taken into account the color anti - triplet structure of diquark . the relative velocity is given by the following expression : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the square of heavy diquark four - momentum .",
    "in nrqcd we take the limit of low velocities , so that denoting the diquark invariant mass squared by @xmath102 and the reduced quark pair mass by @xmath103 , we find @xmath104 at @xmath105 .",
    "the corrected spectral densities are equal to @xmath106 ^ 3,\\nonumber\\\\ \\rho^c_{1,\\xi_{qq}^{\\diamond}}(\\omega ) & = & 3 \\rho^c_{1,\\xi^{\\prime\\diamond}_{qq^{\\prime}}}(\\omega ) = 3 \\rho^c_{1,\\xi_{qq}^{*\\diamond}}(\\omega ) .",
    "\\label{css}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    further , the spectral functions , connected to the condensates of light quarks and gluons , can be derived .",
    "for the quark condensate term we have the following expressions : @xmath107 which have to be multiplied by the sommerfeld factor @xmath96 , wherein the variable @xmath108 is substituted by @xmath109 , since in this case we have no integration over the quark - diquark invariant mass .",
    "it is interesting to stress that in nrqcd the light quark condensate contributes to the @xmath85 correlators , only .",
    "this fact has a simple physical explanation : to the leading order the light quark operator can be factorized in the expression for the correlator of baryonic currents .",
    "indeed , we can write down for the condensate contribution @xmath110 where @xmath111 denotes the appropriate diquark current with the color index @xmath112 , as it is defined by the baryon structure in eqs . ( [ def ] ) .",
    "so , we see that the restriction by the first term independent of @xmath113 in the expansion for the quark correlator in ( [ qq ] ) results in the independent contribution of diquark correlator to the baryonic one . then , since the diquark correlator is isolated in @xmath85 from the baryonic formfactor @xmath84 , the nrqcd sum rules lead to the evaluation of diquark mass and couplings from @xmath85 , and estimation of baryon masses and couplings from @xmath84 . these masses and couplings are different .",
    "the positive point is the possibility to calculate the binding energy for the doubly heavy baryons @xmath114 .",
    "the disadvantage is the instability of nrqcd sum rules at this stage , since the various formfactors or correlators lead to the different results . in sum rules of full qcd various choices of parameters in the definitions of baryonic currents",
    "result in an admixture of pure diquark correlator in various formfactors , so that the estimations acquire huge uncertainties .",
    "say , the characteristic ambiguity in the evaluation of baryon mass in full qcd is about 300 mev , i.e. the value close to the expected estimate of @xmath115 .",
    "the analysis in the framework of nrqcd makes this result to be not unexpectable .",
    "moreover , it is quite evident that the introduction of interactions between the light quark and the doubly heavy diquark destroys the factorization of diquark correlator .",
    "indeed , we see that due to the higher terms in expansion ( [ qq ] ) , the diquark factorization is explicitly broken , which has to result in the convergency of estimates obtained from @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "below we show numerically that this fact is valid .",
    "technically , we point out that the contribution to the moments of spectral density , determined by the light quark condensate including the mixed condensate and the product of quark and gluon condensates , can be calculated after the exploration of ( [ qq ] ) , so that @xmath116\\ ; { \\cal m}_n^{\\langle\\bar q q\\rangle}.\\ ] ] for the corrections due to the gluon condensate we have @xmath117 which are written down for @xmath118 , having the form @xmath54 .    for the product of condensates @xmath119 , wherein the gluon fields are connected to the heavy quarks in contrast to the light quark , we have computed the contribution to the two - point correlation function itself .",
    "it has the following form : @xmath120 where @xmath121 at the point under consideration , and the correlators have to be expanded in series of t , which gives the moments .",
    "thus , we provide the nrqcd sum rules , where we take into account the perturbative terms and the vacuum expectations of quark - gluon operators up to the contributions by the light quark condensate , gluon condensate , their product and the mixed condensate . note , that the product of condensates is essential for the doubly heavy baryons , and we present the full nrqcd expression for this term , including the interaction of nonperturbative gluons with both the light and heavy quarks .",
    "the correct introduction of coulomb - like interactions is done for the perturbative spectral densities of heavy diquark , which is important for the nonrelativistic heavy quarks .",
    "finally , we find the spin - symmetry relation for the baryon couplings in nrqcd @xmath122      to connect the nrqcd sum rules to the quantities in full qcd we have to take into account the anomalous dimensions of effective baryonic currents with the nonrelativistic quarks .",
    "they determine the factors , which have to multiply the nrqcd correlators to obtain the values in full qcd .",
    "indeed , to the leading order of nrqcd we have the relation @xmath123 where the coefficient @xmath124 depends on the normalization scale @xmath125 and obeys the matching condition at the starting point of @xmath126 .",
    "the anomalous dimensions of nrqcd currents are independent of the diquark spin structure in the leading order .",
    "they are equal to @xcite @xmath127 where @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 for @xmath132 , @xmath133 being the number of light quarks . in eq.([gamma ] ) we give the one - loop result with the arbitrary gauge parameter @xmath134 , and the two - loop anomalous dimension is represented in the feynman gauge @xmath135 .",
    "so , numerically at @xmath136 and @xmath135 we find @xmath137 in the leading logarithmic approximation and to the one - loop accuracy , the coefficient @xmath124 is given by the expression @xmath138 where @xmath139 .",
    "to evaluate the two - loop expression for @xmath124 we have to know subleading corrections in the first @xmath140 order in addition to the anomalous dimensions .",
    "these corrections are not available yet , so we restrict ourselves by the one - loop accuracy .",
    "further , we have to determine the normalization point for the nrqcd estimates @xmath141 .",
    "we put it to the average momentum transfer inside the doubly heavy diquark , so that @xmath142 , where @xmath143 denotes the kinetic energy in the system of two heavy quarks , which is phenomenologically independent of the quark flavors and approximately equal to 0.2 gev",
    ". then , the coefficients @xmath124 are equal to @xmath144 with the characteristic uncertainty about 10% because of the variation of initial and final points @xmath145 .    finally , we emphasize that the values of @xmath124 do not change the estimates of baryon masses calculated in the sum rules of nrqcd .",
    "however , they are essential in the evaluation of baryon couplings , which acquire these multiplicative factors .",
    "in the present paper we explore the sum rule scheme of moments for the spectral functions of correlators . we have to stress that in this scheme the dominant uncertainty in the results is caused by the variation of heavy quark masses . in the analysis we chose the following region of mass values : @xmath146 which is ordinary used in the sum rule estimates for the heavy quarkonia .",
    "next critical point is the value of qcd coupling constant determining the coulomb - like interactions inside the doubly heavy diquark .",
    "indeed , it stands linearly in front of the perturbative functions of diquark contributions .",
    "thus , the introduction of @xmath5-corrections is essential for both the baryon couplings and the relative contributions of perturbative terms and condensates to the baryon masses . to decrease the uncertainty",
    "we impose the same approach to the heavy quarkonia , where it is well justified , and then , we extract the characteristic values for the heavy - heavy systems from the comparison of calculations with the current data on the leptonic constants of heavy quarkonia , which are known experimentally for @xmath147 and @xmath148 or evaluated in various approaches for @xmath149 .",
    "so , our calculations give the following couplings of coulomb interactions @xmath150 the dependence of estimates on the value of thershold for the continuum contribution is not so valuable as on the quark masses .",
    "we fix the region of @xmath69 as @xmath151 for the condensates of quarks and gluons the following regions are under consideration : @xmath152 so , we have described the choices of parameters .    figs .",

    "we certainly see that at low numbers of moments for the spectral densities , the baryon - diquark mass difference can be evaluated as @xmath156 which is quite a reasonable value , being in a good agreement with the estimates in the heavy - light mesons .",
    "in the region of mass difference stability we can fix the number of moment for the spectral density , say , @xmath157 for @xmath154 , and calculate the corresponding masses of baryons , which are equal to @xmath158 where we do not take into account the spin - dependent splitting caused by the @xmath140-corrections to the heavy - light interactions , which are not available yet .",
    "the uncertainties in the mass values are basically given by the variation of heavy quark masses .",
