    "in @xcite , silnikov introduced the concept of a homoclinic tube which can be obtained through a transversal intersection of the center - unstable and center - stable manifolds of a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold under a map in @xmath3 . intuitively speaking ,",
    "a homoclinic tube can be regarded as a homoclinic orbit on which points are replaced by submanifolds . under certain assumption [ equation ( 11 ) on page 625 of @xcite ] which is uncheckable , all the invariant tubes in the neighborhood of the homoclinic tube can be labeled symbolically .",
    "such a symbolic labeling does not imply bernoulli shift of a single map .",
    "the result was proved through a contraction map argument on a sequence of metric spaces . in the current article",
    ", we will adopt a different approach developed in @xcite .",
    "we will establish bernoulli shift dynamics of submanifolds through shadowing lemma .",
    "the uncheckable assumption of silnikov is removed .",
    "we will work in a banach space , while silnikov worked in @xmath3 .    especially for high dimensional systems ,",
    "homoclinic tubes are more dominant structures than homoclinic orbits .",
    "in fact , the invariant manifold that the homoclinic tube is asymptotic to , can contain smaller scale chaotic dynamics as discussed in @xcite @xcite . although structures in a neighborhood of a homoclinic orbit have been extensively and intensively investigated ,",
    "structures around a homoclinic tube have not been well studied @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite .",
    "i believe that homoclinic tubes will play an important role in the theory of chaos in hamiltonian partial differential equations .",
