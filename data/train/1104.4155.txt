    "a cognitive radio ( cr ) @xcite@xcite system may coexist with a primary network on an either interference - free or interference - tolerant basis @xcite . for the former case",
    ", the cr system only exploits the unused spectra of the primary network . while , for the latter case , the cr system is allowed to share the spectra assigned to primary network under the condition that it must not impose detrimental interference on the primary network .",
    "therefore , the interference from the cr network to the primary system should be carefully managed and cancelled in order to protect the operation of the primary system . various interference mitigation ( i m )",
    "techniques applicable to cr networks have been reported in @xcite . as for multiple - antenna cr networks , transmit beamforming ( for single - data - stream transmission ) @xcite@xcite or precoding ( for multiple - data - stream transmission ) @xcite@xcite is an effective approach to proactively cancel interference from cr transmitters to the primary network . on one hand , it steers the cr transmission to avoid interfering with the primary network . on the other hand",
    ", it exploits the diversity or the multiplexing gain of the multiple - antenna cr system to enhance the reliability or efficiency of the cr system .",
    "however , in the works @xcite@xcite , perfect or partial csi of cr interference channels to primary network ( cr - primary interference channels ) is required at the cr transmitter side to guarantee no / constrained interference to the primary system .",
    "therefore , extra signaling between primary and cr networks is inevitable to obtain the csi , which jeopardizes the applicability of these beamforming and precoding schemes . a more practical precoding scheme - sensing - projection ( sp)-based precoding , which learns the csi using subspace estimation @xcite and does not require",
    "a priori csi , has been proposed for a cr multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) transmitter - receiver pair coexisting with a primary time - division - duplexing ( tdd ) system in @xcite .",
    "however , such precoding scheme does not account for the interference from primary transmitters to the cr receiver ( primary - cr interference ) , which leads to a cr throughput loss . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "it is proposed to remove the primary - cr interference at the cr receiver via null - space receiver beamforming , which sacrifices the cr throughput as well . moreover",
    ", the cr network in @xcite has to work in a tdd mode aligned with the primary system in order to facilitate the null - space receiver beamforming .    in this paper , two enhanced sp - based precoding schemes ,",
    "namely , full - projection ( fp)- and partial - projection ( pp)-based precoding , are proposed for cr mimo systems by incorporating the primary - cr interference .",
    "as the name suggests , the fp - based scheme nulls the cr transmission by fully projecting the transmission onto the estimated null space of the cr - primary interference channels . instead of removing the primary - cr interference using null - space receiver beamforming , the proposed precoding schemes account for the primary - cr interference via sensing .",
    "this , on one hand , improves the cr throughput , and on the other hand , introduces more flexibility into the cr deployment , i.e. , the cr network does not have to work in a tdd mode as in @xcite .",
    "the pp - based precoding can further improve the cr throughput by projecting the cr transmission onto a subspace that partially spans the estimated null space of the cr - primary interference channels .",
    "as a result , the cr throughput is further improved at the cost of introducing extra interference to the primary network .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows .",
    "the system model is given in section  ii .",
    "the principle of the sp - based precoding is introduced in section  iii .",
    "the new precoding schemes are proposed in section iv .",
    "the performance of the proposed precoding schemes is evaluated in section  v. finally , we conclude the paper in section  vi .",
    "we consider a cr system shown in fig .  1 , where a cr transmitter - receiver pair shares the same spectrum with a primary tdd network .",
    "multiple antennas are mounted at the cr nodes and possibly at each of the primary users .",
    "the cr transmitter , cr receiver , primary base station ( bs ) and the @xmath0th primary user are equipped with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) antennas , respectively .",
    "block - fading channels are assumed for the primary and cr systems . for a narrowband transmission",
    ", the received symbol at the cr receiver can be expressed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the received signal vector at the cr receiver , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the transmit information vector with @xmath10 and precoding matrix of the cr transmitter , respectively , @xmath11 is the channel matrix from the cr transmitter to cr receiver , whose elements are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "complex gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance @xmath12 , and @xmath13 stands for the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) vector with zero mean and covariance matrix @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , @xmath15 denotes the interference from the primary network to cr receiver .",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath16    the overall cr system is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the matrices @xmath17 in and @xmath18 ( see fig .  1 ) represent the interference channels from all the @xmath19 active primary users to cr receiver and to cr transmitter , respectively , during primary uplink .",
    "similarly , @xmath20 in together with @xmath21 ( see fig .  1 ) stand for the interference matrices from the primary bs to cr receiver and to cr transmitter during primary downlink .",
    "all these interference matrices ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) have i.i.d .",
    "complex gaussian random elements with zero mean and covariances @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the transmitted signal vectors of all the @xmath19 primary users and primary bs , respectively .",
    "we define the covariance matrix of the interference in as @xmath32 .",
    "the precoding problem for cr transmission can be expressed as the following optimisation problem @xcite @xmath33 in , @xmath34 is the channel matrix from the cr transmitter to the @xmath0th primary user .",
    "thus , the channel matrix from the cr transmitter to all primary users becomes @xmath35^t$ ] , where channel reciprocity is assumed .",
    "the constraints on the cr transmission power and the maximum allowed interference perceived at each primary user are given by and , respectively .",
    "the projected channel singular value decomposition ( svd ) or p - svd precoding has been proposed in @xcite as a suboptimal solution for the optimisation problem . it can be expressed as @xmath36^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , @xmath38 denotes the power level for a water - filling ( wf ) algorithm , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 originate from the svd of the effective cr channel matrix @xmath41 @xmath42 its svd is expressed as @xmath43 , and @xmath44 in is from another svd @xmath45 , which is estimated via sensing in the sp precoding @xcite as shown in fig .  2 .    by analogy with the multiple signal classification technique @xcite",
    ", the signal covariance matrix is decomposed into signal and noise subspaces to estimate @xmath44 , which can be mathematically expressed as @xmath46 in , @xmath47 is the @xmath48th received symbol at the cr transmitter , and @xmath49 denotes the average covariance matrix of the received symbols .",
    "an eigenvalue decomposition is then performed on @xmath49 in , where @xmath50 is a diagonal matrix with descendingly ordered eigenvalues of @xmath49 and @xmath51 contains the corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "the matrix @xmath49 is further decomposed into interference and noise components in with @xmath52 and @xmath53 being the first @xmath54 and the remaining @xmath55 columns of @xmath56 , respectively , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 being their corresponding eigenvalue matrices .",
    "in this section , we elaborate the cr precoding during the primary downlink . a similar precoding for the primary uplink can be easily obtained , which is ignored here for brevity .",
    "when incorporating the primary - cr interference , the precoding problem for the cr transmitter during the primary downlink can be expressed as the following optimisation problem @xmath59 then , the precoding matrix for cr transmission during the downlink can be written as @xmath60^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the power level for the wf algorithm similar to that in and @xmath62 is obtained through the following eigenvalue decomposition @xmath63 it can be seen from and that in order to obtain the cr precoding matrix , the interference - plus - noise covariance matrix @xmath64 needs to be estimated at the cr receiver , besides the estimation of the interference subspace @xmath65 at the cr transmitter .      to enable the estimation of @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    ", we propose an enhanced precoding scheme .",
    "the system diagram for this scheme is demonstrated in fig .  2 .",
    "each cr cycle consists of sensing and transmission phases .",
    "we name the cr transmission during the primary downlink transmission as t1 and uplink transmission as t2 . for t1 , the space @xmath67 is estimated at the cr transmitter during the primary uplink according to  over @xmath68 symbols .",
    "the estimation of @xmath66 is performed at the cr receiver at the beginning of the primary downlink for a batch of @xmath69 symbols via a procedure similar to . after obtaining these two estimates ,",
    "the cr transmitter starts transmission t1 using the precoding matrix obtained by .",
    "then t2 follows immediately after t1 but right before the sensing phase for the next cr cycle .",
    "the cr precoding matrix for t2 can be obtained by other two sensing sessions concurrent with the sensing phase for t1 .",
    "the fp - based channel projection is employed in this proposed precoding scheme .",
    "therefore , it is termed as fp precoding .",
    "it can be seen from fig .  2 that the proposed fp precoding scheme shifts the cr cycle of the sp precoding rightwards in time .",
    "by doing this , several benefits are obtained .",
    "firstly , introducing cr receiver sensing phases during both the primary downlink and uplink improves the cr instantaneous throughput by incorporating the interference - plus - noise covariance matrix into precoding , and consequently improves the cr throughput .",
    "secondly , shifting the cr cycle diverts part of the cr transmission from the primary downlink to the uplink which reduces the time that primary receivers expose themselves to interference from the cr transmitter .",
    "this is beneficial to the primary network , since primary users are usually more susceptible to cr interference than the primary bs .",
    "theoretically , the proposed fp precoding can completely cancel the cr - primary interference if there is no error in the interference space estimation .",
    "however , the i m ability of the proposed fp precoding degrades rapidly when the cr interference - to - noise ratio , inr@xmath70 , drops below a threshold .",
    "this is due to the fact that in some components in the noise subspace may swap with those in the interference subspace when the noise amplitude @xmath71 is relatively large compared to the interference channel gain @xmath72 .",
    "this phenomenon is known as a _ _ subspace swap _",
    "_ @xcite .    for low inr",
    ", the interference subspace has a high probability to swap with the noise subspace .",
    "when a subspace swap happens , can be rewritten as @xmath73 which means that the precoding matrix @xmath74 and @xmath75 span the same space . therefore ,",
    "when the cr inr is low the average interference power received at primary users can be expressed as @xmath76 this suggests that the average interference power at primary users is proportional to the channel gain between cr and primary users at low cr inr .",
    "the average cr - primary interference in the large cr inr regime becomes @xmath77 where is due to the fact that @xmath78 ; is obtained using the fact that @xmath79 for high inr @xcite with @xmath80 $ ] , and @xmath81 $ ] ; follows from the independence of @xmath82 and @xmath83 and @xmath84 for any constant matrix @xmath85 .",
    "note that @xmath86 in is the transmit covariance matrix for the primary user .",
    "an interesting fact can be observed from that at high cr inr the average received interference at primary users does not depend on the interference channel @xmath75 .",
    "the average interference is proportional to the channel noise @xmath87 and inversely proportional to the sensing length @xmath68 .      to further improve the throughput of the cr link , the cr transmitter may null its transmission to a subspace partially spanning the interference space .",
    "therefore , we introduce another precoding scheme , namely , the pp precoding",
    ".    the pp precoding works in a similar manner to the above proposed fp precoding except for the selection of the interference space . for the downlink cr precoding",
    ", the cr transmitter first obtains @xmath88 and @xmath56 via eigenvalue decomposition in during uplink sensing .",
    "then , a subspace @xmath89 partially spanning the interference space is obtained by choosing @xmath90 eigenvectors corresponding to the first @xmath90 largest eigenvalues of @xmath88 , where @xmath90 can be determined according to various criteria .",
    "one candidate criterion is @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "we call @xmath93 the trivial over dominant interference ratio ( tdir ) .",
    "this selection process chooses @xmath90 dominant interference subchannels to form an estimate of the interference space and ignores the other @xmath94 trivial ones .",
    "when equal power is assigned to each cr antenna , @xmath93 stands for the maximum ratio of the resulting and nullified interference to the primary receiver .",
    "finally , substituting the estimated subspace @xmath89 for @xmath95 in , the precoding matrix @xmath74 for the downlink cr transmission can be obtained via .",
    "however , we may fail to find a value of @xmath90 satisfying . in this case",
    ", the proposed fp precoding is used .",
    "the uplink cr precoding can be performed in the similar manner as the downlink counterpart .",
    "the joint probability density function ( pdf ) of the ordered eigenvalues @xmath96 $ ] of @xmath49 , with @xmath97 is @xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the transmission power of each primary user antenna and @xmath100 with @xmath101 is given by @xmath102}{\\prod^{m_{\\rm{min}}}_{i=1}(m_{\\rm{max}}-i ) !",
    "\\prod^{m_{\\rm{min}}}_{i=1}(m_{\\rm{min}}-i)!}\\ ] ] with @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , the probability for the occurrence of is @xmath104 where @xmath105",
    ".    in other words , for the pp precoding scheme the probabilities of using the ` real ' pp ( @xmath90 satisfying exists ) and using fp are @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the cr transmitter uses @xmath108 and @xmath109 degrees of freedom ( dof ) for interference mitigation in the pp and fp precoding schemes , respectively .",
    "meanwhile , the dof for cr transmission for the pp and fp precoding are @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "this means that compared to the proposed fp precoding the pp precoding scheme transfers @xmath112 dof from interference mitigation to cr transmission , which leads to a higher throughput for the cr link .",
    "it can be seen from  that in the large inr regime , @xmath106 is fixed for a given noise power @xmath87 and @xmath99 , i.e. , the probability of the ` real ' pp and fp does not change with the interference channel @xmath113 . considering the fact from that at high inrs the average interference power of fp @xmath114 is fixed and the average interference power resulting from ` real ' pp @xmath115 is proportional to the square of the interference channel gain @xmath27 , the overall average interference of the pp precoding @xmath116 is linearly proportional to @xmath27 for large inrs .",
    "in this section , the performance of the proposed precoding schemes is evaluated via simulations .",
    "we consider a scenario where a cr mimo system coexists with a primary tdd system which has one 2-antenna bs and two single - antenna users .",
    "each cr node is equipped with four antennas , i.e. , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 . the primary network works as a downlink - broadcast and an uplink multiple - access system .",
    "the primary bs uses perfect zero - forcing beamforming at both the primary downlink and uplink .",
    "the transmission power of the cr and primary networks is @xmath121 .",
    "all the results are obtained by averaging over 2000 simulation runs .",
    "first , we evaluate the throughput of the cr system with the proposed precoding schemes over different values of signal - to - noise ratios , snr@xmath122 . in fig .  3 ,",
    "the throughputs ( mutual information in averaged over a cr cycle ) of the two proposed precoding schemes are compared with that of the sp precoding of @xcite , @xcite and the p - svd precoding with perfect csi of @xcite .",
    "the system setup is as follows : @xmath123 , and @xmath124 .",
    "it can be seen that the proposed fp / pp precoding schemes lead to higher cr throughput than the sp precoding , and the throughput gain becomes larger as the snr increases .",
    "4 evaluates the impact of cr inr on the cr throughput and the resulting cr - primary interference under different precoding schemes .",
    "it has the same setup as that of fig .  3 with @xmath125 .",
    "by comparing fig .",
    "4(a ) with fig .",
    "4(b ) , it can be seen that the proposed fp / pp precoding schemes outperform the sp counterpart at low inrs , since they lead to higher cr throughput without introducing extra interference . at high inrs , both the proposed fp and sp precoding schemes have fixed interference , and there is a fairly good agreement between the derived and simulated interference of the fp precoding . another phenomenon which can be seen from fig .",
    "4(b ) is that the interference of the sp precoding is slightly smaller than that of the fp precoding .",
    "this is due to the fact that the sensing of the sp precoding is longer than the uplink sensing of the fp precoding .",
    "moreover , at high inrs the interference of the proposed pp precoding is linearly proportional to the cr inr , which supports our analysis in section  iv.b .",
    "in this paper , two sp - based precoding schemes , namely , fp and pp precoding , have been proposed for cr mimo systems to mitigate the interference to the primary network and improve the cr throughput .",
    "these two precoding schemes are capable of estimating the csi of interference channels between primary and cr networks and can account for the interference from the primary system via a novel sensing approach .",
    "therefore , no extra signaling is required between primary and cr systems , which consequently eases the deployment of cr networks .",
    "the performance of the proposed precoding schemes has been evaluated and compared to that of the existing precoding approaches .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the fp precoding can boost the cr throughput and does not introduce extra interference to the primary system in the low inr regime .",
    "the pp precoding can further improve the cr throughput if the primary system can tolerate some extra interference .",
