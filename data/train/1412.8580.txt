    "the method of deift and zhou has found various applications in the asymptotic studies of orthogonal polynomials .",
    "the first few examples , published in 1999 , are polynomials with absolutely continuous weights ; see , e.g. , deift _ et al .",
    "the powerful method is based on the riemann - hilbert problem ( rhp ) formulation of the orthogonal polynomials observed by fokas , its and kitaev @xcite .",
    "a crucial idea is a deformation of the contours associated with the factorization of the oscillating jump matrices .",
    "technique difficulties usually lie in the construction of the parametrices at critical points .    in 2007 , baik _",
    "et al._@xcite developed a general method for the asymptotics of discrete orthogonal polynomials by using the riemann - hilbert approach .",
    "the starting point of their investigation is the interpolation problem ( ip ) for discrete orthogonal polynomials , introduced in borodin and boyarchenko @xcite .",
    "a key step is to turn the ip into a rhp , and then the deift - zhou method for oscillating rhp may apply . for the case when all nodes are real , the real line is divided into intervals termed void , saturated region , or band , associated with the equilibrium measure ; see @xcite when the nodes are regularly distributed . in general case , an open interval is called a saturated region , if the ratio of the density of the polynomial zeros and the density of the nodes is @xmath0 , called void if the ration is @xmath1 , and band otherwise .    since then , much attention has been attracted to this topic .",
    "for example , in an attempt to achieve global asymptotics , with global referring to the domains of uniformity , wong and coworkers considered cases with finite nodes @xcite , and infinite nodes @xcite regularly distributed .",
    "very recently , the present authors @xcite have studied the uniform asymptotics for discrete orthogonal polynomials on infinite nodes with an accumulation point , the mass showing a singular behavior there .",
    "a major modification to the method has been made by bleher and liechty @xcite in the treatment of the band - saturated region endpoints .",
    "the example they take is a system of discrete orthogonal polynomials with respect to a varying exponential weight on a regular infinite lattice . here",
    "regular infinite lattice means that the infinite nodes are equally spaced .",
    "other than the discrete orthogonal polynomials and those with absolutely continuous weights , there are interesting mixed - type cases that the orthogonal measures are supported on both intervals and discrete nodes .",
    "examples can be found in askey and ismail ( * ? ? ?",
    "6 ) , and in ismail @xcite , where the random walk polynomials are shown having this feature . a natural question arises here : how could the riemann - hilbert approach be used to handle such problems ?    in this paper",
    ", we illustrate the method by taking as an example a class of sieved pollaczek polynomials .",
    "a significant fact is that the corresponding orthogonal measure consists of an absolutely continuous part on @xmath2 $ ] , and a discrete part having infinite many mass points with the endpoint @xmath0 as an accumulation point ; see charris and ismail @xcite and wang and zhao @xcite .",
    "it is known that the sieved pollaczek polynomials @xmath3 possess the orthogonal relation @xmath4 where the absolutely continuous weight @xmath5for @xmath6 while @xmath7 , and the mass @xmath8 with nodes @xmath9 , @xmath10 ; see @xcite for detailed determination of the orthogonal measure . it is easily seen that @xmath11 as @xmath12 , which indicates a singularity of the discrete weight at the accumulation point @xmath13 .    the polynomials @xmath14 can also be defined by the three - term recurrence relation @xmath15 with initial values @xmath16 and @xmath17 ; see charris and ismail @xcite , ismail@xcite , and wang and zhao @xcite and the references therein .",
    "it is seen from and the corresponding initial conditions that @xmath18hence , without loss of generality , we may assume that @xmath19 .",
    "methods other than the riemann - hilbert approach may be applied to obtain asymptotics of the sieved pollaczek polynomials ; cf . ,",
    "e.g. , szeg @xcite and wong and zhao @xcite .",
    "indeed , in an earlier work , wang and zhao @xcite have considered the uniform asymptotic expansions for the polynomials on the real line , in particular at the turning points @xmath20 and @xmath21 and the endpoints @xmath22 , by using an integral method .",
    "the expansion in an @xmath23 neighborhood of @xmath24 is in terms of the airy function , while at @xmath25 , where the polynomials oscillate on both sides , we need a combination of the airy functions to describe the behavior .",
    "the asymptotics of the extreme zeros are also obtained in @xcite .",
    "however , the derivation is limited to the real line , and , rigorously , there are gaps between the intervals of uniformity .",
    "further study is desirable for such polynomials .",
    "the main purpose of the present investigation is to derive uniform asymptotic approximations on the whole complex plane for the orthogonal polynomials with both absolutely continuous measure and discrete measure , using the riemann - hilbert approach and taking the sieved pollaczek polynomials as an example .    to this aim",
    ", first we formulate the mixed riemann - hilbert and interpolation problem for the polynomials .",
    "then , we convert the problem into a riemann - hilbert problem by using the notion of band and saturated region of baik _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and the treatment of the band - saturated region endpoints by bleher and liechty @xcite .",
    "the deift - zhou nonlinear steepest descent method for oscillating riemann - hilbert problems plays a central part from then on .",
    "the main idea here is the oscillating contour consists of the interval of the absolutely continuous measure , joined by the discrete band .",
    "technically , there are several facts in the analysis worth mentioning .",
    "several auxiliary functions @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are introduced at an early stage @xmath29 , to simplify the jump conditions , and to clarify the construction of the outer parametrix for @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath31-function is supported on an infinite interval , so that the contours are finite later in the rhp for @xmath32 . in the parametrix for @xmath30",
    ", we bring in extra singularities to fit the matching conditions on the boundaries of the shrinking neighborhoods of the mrs numbers @xmath33 and @xmath34 , in which the local papametries are constructed .",
    "the phase condition on the band @xmath35 plays a role in the determination of the equilibrium measure , and very careful estimates of the @xmath36-functions are also needed since the domains of local parametries are shrinking .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section [ statement - of - result ] , we state the main asymptotic approximations in regions covering the upper half plane . in section",

    "the nonlinear steepest descent analysis is carried in section [ steepest - descent - analysis ] .",
    "the proof of the main asymptotic theorem is provided in section [ proof - of - theorem ] by using the analysis in previous sections .",

    "it is worth noting that the boundary values of @xmath51 on the upper and lower edges of @xmath52 are purely imaginary .",
    "frequent use will also be made of the following scaled variables and the meromorphic functions , namely , @xmath53where @xmath54 , with @xmath55 being the beta function .",
    "to describe the behavior at the soft edges , we use conformal mappings @xmath56 respectively in neighborhoods of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and constructed in terms of the @xmath36-functions defined in section [ mrs ] and analyzed in detail in section [ phi - alpha - phi - beta ] .",
