    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , are semi - detached binary stars consisting of a roche lobe - filling late - type dwarf ( the secondary star ) which loses matter onto a white dwarf ( the primary ) . unless the primary has a considerable magnetic field , the transfered matter has enough specific angular momentum to create a gaseous accretion disc around this accreting star .",
    "some cvs  the dwarf novae  have discs which occasionally have luminous phases of high mass - accretion but spend most of their time in a faint quiescent state . in quiescence ,",
    "the optical light is usually dominated by optically thin line emission from the disc and continuum emission from the white dwarf , the disc and the bright spot caused by the impact of the transferred material onto the disc .    while spectral and eclipse observations of erupting dwarf novae show that the disc is optically thick during the outburst state ,",
    "there is considerable uncertainty about the state of the quiescent discs .",
    "theoretical models for the outbursts invoking a thermal instability as the cause of the eruption require that the quiescent disc store up material for the next eruption in a less viscous state in which the disc should be cool and optically thick ( e.g. ludwig et al . 1994 )",
    ". the inner disc may be emptied by irradiation from the hot white dwarf ( leach et al .",
    "1999 ) or by a siphon flow fueled by a hot corona in the inner disc ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 ) .",
    "thus , the expectation is that the outer disc is cool and optically thick and the inner disc is warm / hot and optically thin .",
    "ht  cas was once called `` the _ rosetta stone _ of dwarf novae '' , because  being one of the relatively few eclipsing dwarf novae ",
    "it more readily revealed its secrets ( patterson 1981 ) .",
    "it has seldom been caught in outburst because of the unusually long outburst period of about 400 @xmath7 50 days ( wenzel 1987 ) .",
    "the quiescent periods may even last up to almost 9 years indicating an extremely low mass accretion rate in quiescence .",
    "the accretion disc is hardly visible during quiescence and the bright spot , the impact region of the accretion stream from the secondary , is nearly absent ( wood , horne & vennes et al .",
    "1992 , hereafter whv92 ) .",
    "the light curves predominantly show the eclipse of the white dwarf . the optical spectrum of ht  cas ( young",
    ", schneider & shectman 1981 ) shows double peaked emission lines of h  i , he  i , he  ii and ca  ii , typical for a high inclination system ( @xmath8 : horne , wood & stiening 1991 , hereafter hws91 ) .",
    "consistent with the broad - band photometry , the averaged profiles do not show any significant blue / red asymmetry , which would normally be attributed to the bright spot .",
    "whv92 investigated the accretion disc using multicolour eclipse photometry from which the contribution of the white dwarf had been subtracted .",
    "they produced independent classical eclipse maps for each colour and then modeled them with a two - parameter model spectrum yielding the temperature and surface density distribution in the disc . while this analysis suggested that the disc is optically thin  as expected",
    " it suffers in detail due to the individual smearing of each eclipse map ( see vrielmann , horne & hessman 1999 ; hereafter vhh99 ) .",
    "furthermore , the pre - subtraction of the white dwarf contribution and the use of simple cartesian reconstruction maps can make it difficult to produce a consistent physical picture of the various components .    our present investigation is aimed at improving our understanding of the physical state of the quiescent accretion disc in ht  cas .",
    "we apply the _ physical parameter eclipse mapping _ method ( ppem )  a distinctly different tomographic ansatz ( vhh99 ) which also uses the maximum - entropy method ( mem ; skilling & bryan 1984 )  to the same ubvr photometry and derive the white dwarf temperature and the disc structure by simultaneously fitting all available eclipse light curves .",
    "since the dataset has been previously published and analysed , details about the acquisition can be found in hws91 .",
    "the photometric data consist of 16 eclipses taken in september 1982 and november / december 1983 at the palomar 60-inch telescope using the stiening photometer which gathers data in four filters simultaneously .",
    "the previous outburst occured in march 1980 and the quiescence lasted until the super outburst in january 1985 .",
    "ht cas was therefore in the middle of a quiescence period .",
    "the original data have a time resolution of 1  s. as can be seen in fig.1 in hws91 the basic eclipse shape appears to be constant , we do not even see a distiguished difference between the 1982 and 1983 data .",
    "but the individual eclipses suffer heavily from flickering .",
    "we averaged all light curves in order to enhance any stable patterns and minimize all random features , like flickering .",
    "the averaged light curves were then phase - binned to @xmath9 near the eclipse ( within phases @xmath10 and 0.07 ) and @xmath11 outside this range ( fig .  [ htf ] ) .",
    "we used the photometric system parameters as given by hws91 , namely a mass ratio @xmath12 , an inclination angle @xmath8 , as well as a white dwarf mass and radius of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . with an orbital period of 106min ,",
    "the distance @xmath15 from the primary to the l@xmath16-point is @xmath17 cm .",
    "the mass and radius of the secondary star derived by hws91 are @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "whv92 determined the @xmath20 as definately smaller than 0.2 and more likely between 0 and 0.1 .",
    "therefore , we neglect the interstellar reddening for our calculations .",
    "wood et al .  ( 1995 ) , using ubvr photometry of the white dwarf extracted from the eclipse light curve , derived a value of 165@xmath710 pc .",
    "marsh ( 1990 ) deduced a distance of 140@xmath714 pc using the observed na i and tio absorption spectrum of the secondary and his own calibration of the tio @xmath21 band strengths , a surface brightness calibration for m giants ( the barnes - evans relation ; barnes et al .",
    "1978 ) , and the radial velocity amplitude @xmath22 .",
    "this derivation makes several assumptions about the nature of the secondary star .",
    "marsh predicted a mid - eclipse infrared h magnitude of @xmath23 for the secondary but berriman et al .",
    "( 1987 ) measured @xmath24 , indicating that the system may be farther away than 200 pc .",
    "two months after the first infrared measurements , berriman et al.measured a much brighter h magnitude of 14.5 , apparently confirming marsh s distance , but this difference could have been due to an increase in the constribution from the uneclipsed component ( e.g.  the outer regions of the disc ) . although zhang et al .",
    "( 1986 ) derived an even larger distance of 320pc from their analysis of bvr light curves , this distance is undoubtably made too large by their assumption of pure blackbody emission from the disc and the lack of u - band data .",
    "marsh s estimate depends on his identification of the m5.4 @xmath7 0.03 spectrum ( derived from his own calibration of the tio band strengths ) , the secondary s flux at mid - eclipse ( @xmath25mjy at 7500 ) , and the barnes - evans relation ( the surface brightness of giant stars versus v - r colour ) ; barnes et al .",
    "beuermann et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have recalibrated the barnes - evans relations ( surface brightness versus colour ) for both giants and dwarfs and find that the relation for m5 dwarfs is about 0.12 mag fainter than that for giants .",
    "this effect implies a 5% decrease in marsh s distance estimate ( @xmath26 instead of @xmath27pc ) .",
    "marsh s spectral type depends upon the relative strengths of the tio features at @xmath28 : the latter band is contaminated with weak oi emission , so that the @xmath29 ratio may be over - estimated , and the spectral type later than m5.4 .",
    "though , the type is probably not any later than m6 , since the region around tio @xmath30 does not show the multiple absorbtion features prominent for later types .",
    "weichhold & beuermann ( 2000 ) and beuermann ( 2000 ) have also constructed a tio surface brightness relation which can be used for systems like ht  cas with severe veiling . using marsh s m5.4 @xmath7 0.3 spectral type and assuming @xmath31 , the observed tio flux at mid - eclipse and a 94% correction for the roche flattening at phase 0.0 implies a distance of @xmath32pc , in agreement with our revision of marsh s estimate . if the spectral type is as late as m6 , this number drops to 93pc , since the flux of the tio bands drops rapidly after m5.5 .",
    "one can reverse the calculation and compute the expected spectral type given the observed tio flux and assumed distance of 165  pc ( wood et al .",
    "1995 ) : this results in a spectral type of m4.5 .",
    "this would imply an increase in the @xmath29 ratio of 43% over that measured by marsh ( 1990 ) , a ratio which is already too large due to oi contamination .",
    "a spectral type as early as m2-m3 ( corresponding to a distance of @xmath33200pc ) can be simply ruled out because it would require twice as much light at mid - eclipse as is available for the secondary and the residual disc .",
    "the only way to change these results  given that the constraints come from the unilluminated backside of the secondary star  is to decrease the strength of the tio band by lowering the metalicity to at least @xmath34\\approx -1.0 $ ] ( to get a reduction of the band depth by a factor @xmath35 ) .",
    "however , there is no evidence to date of any low - metalicity cv s ( see beuermann et al .",
    "an earlier spectral type is also implausible due to the fact that there is weak evidence that the spectral types of secondary stars in cv s have _ later _  not _ earlier _  spectral types than normal main - sequence stars ( beuermann et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we must conclude that marsh s observations clearly suggest a distance of @xmath1pc ( weighted average of @xmath26 and @xmath32pc ) .",
    "this result remains in conflict with the eclipse - mapping results of wood et al .",
    "given that the latter depends upon several assumptions about the visibility of the white dwarf and its temperature , and that the plausible corrections to our re - analysis of marsh s result tend to make the distance smaller , not larger , we feel that our revision of marsh s estimate is still more reliable .",
    "still , given the uncertainties , it is possible that the distance is somewhat larger .    in principle",
    ", the ppem method can provide us with an independent estimate of the distance , as previously shown by vrielmann , stiening & offutt ( 2002 ) if a proper spectral model is used .",
    "the use of an improper distance produces characteristic features in the maps of the fitted quantities . in appendix  [ app_dist ]",
    "we demonstrate that reliable distances can be found by maximizing the entropy of the fit ( making the disk maps as simple as possible ) at fixed @xmath36 ( requiring a good fit to the lightcurves ) .",
    "when the wrong distance is used , the disk maps become more complicated , and the entropy accordingly becomes increasingly negative .",
    "the best distance is thus identified as that which maximizes the entropy ( simplicity ) of the disk maps .",
    "the determination of a self - consistent distance to ht  cas was hence one of the objectives of this study .",
    "we used the two - parameter spectral model described in vhh99 to map the temperature @xmath37 and surface density @xmath38 of the disc material .",
    "the assumed spectrum is that of a simple uniform slab , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the optical depth , @xmath41 is the mass - density , @xmath42 is the vertical scale height of the slab , here assumed to be the disc s semi - thickness , @xmath43 is the mass absorption coefficient , @xmath44 is the sound speed and @xmath45 the keplerian angular velocity of the disc material .",
    "although we assume a very simple pure hydrogen slab in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) with no line emission , the difficulty in computing accretion disc spectra and our ignorance of the true vertical structure of optically thick or thin discs makes this model still very useful as a means of distinguishing between optically thick and thin parts of the disc .    at the densities and temperatures considered here , lte is a very good approximation .",
    "the assumption of pure hydrogen is quite adequate for hot or warm regions of the disc . for realistic slabs ( i.e. including metals ) at temperatures lower than about 6300k ,",
    "the opacity is still mostly provided by h@xmath46 and hydrogen bound - free emission but the total opacity is much higher due to the increase in the number of free electrons relative to a pure - hydrogen gas .",
    "thus , our method _ severely underestimates _",
    "the intensity emerging from _ cooler _ parts of the disc .",
    "if a certain flux is required , the algorithm will be forced to increase the fitted temperature ( which increases the opacity in this range ) and/or increase the surface density .",
    "_ regions of the reconstructed disc with kinetic temperatures less than 6300k will thus  in fact  have true temperatures and/or surface densities which are significantly lower than those reconstructed using our simple model_. fortunately , this effect will only be important in the least - constrained outer disc where our ability to reconstruct physical parameters is the worst anyway ( due to the disappearance of the balmer jump and low intensities in the observed filters ) .",
    "we will see that our upper limits on the parameters in some regions are still physically useful .    for theoretical spectra with no line emission ,",
    "the physical parameter maps derived from the ubvr magnitudes are similar no matter whether one convolves the spectra with the filter band - passes or uses the monochromatic fluxes at the mean wavelengths of the pass - bands ( indeed in the latter case our numerical results are slightly better ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the continuum is very flat ( similar fluxes in all four passbands ) .",
    "the inclusion of emission lines would improve the sensitivity of the maps to the u - band fluxes and regions with substantial h@xmath5 , and hence to the optically thin parts of the disc .",
    "however , this effect goes in the same direction as that mentioned before for the continuum : these less realistic models have _ less _ flux in the filter pass - band and so require higher temperatures and surface densities .",
    "since ht  cas was in quiescence at the time of observations , we assumed a geometrically thin disc for our ppem study ",
    "an assumption which we will later verify .",
    "we model the white dwarf emission using theoretical white dwarf spectra and treat the star as a true spherical star which is occulted by the secondary , occults the accretion disc behind itself , and can be preset to be partially occulted by the accretion disc .",
    "wood & horne  ( 1990 ) find that the white dwarf is not likely to be partially occulted , although they could not completely rule out a partial occultation of the white dwarf .",
    "our reconstructions ( section  [ maps ] ) imply that the inner disc is optically thick and therefore would lead to an occulted `` lower '' hemisphere of the white dwarf . on the other hand , evaporation of the inner disc ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 )",
    "could lead to a small hole in the accretion disc which , with our limited spatial resolution , would be difficult to detect even with ppem .",
    "however , for the white dwarf to be completely visible , the hole must be larger than @xmath47 , which should be easily detectable in the reconstruction . thus , following wood & horne ( 1990 ) , we first chose a fully visible white dwarf but then also reconstructed the accretion disc using a partially white dwarf for comparison ( see appendix  [ app_wd4 ] ) .",
    "we assume the white dwarf has a uniform temperature @xmath48 , with no limb darkening ( @xmath49 , wood & horne ) .",
    "therefore , we use hws91 s white dwarf radius of 0.0263@xmath50 , which is derived for a vanishing limb - darkening coefficient . since the mean wavelengths of the filter pass - band partly coincide with the absorption lines in the theoretical white dwarf spectra , we integrated these spectra over the photometric filter pass - band functions to derive the theoretical white dwarf flux .",
    "these were then used within ppem to determine the white dwarf temperature .",
    "the slow ellipsoidal variations of the secondary star during quiescence and over the small range of orbital phases considered is roughly @xmath3313% of the secondary s flux ( marsh 1990 ) : given that the secondary star contributes certainly no more than 10% of the light in the r - band and much less in the others , we neglect the variation in the contribution of the secondary over the limited phase range between -0.1 and 0.1 and treat the secondary s light as simply part of the fitted uneclipsed component .    for our reconstructions we used a default map with _ medium _ blurring , as described in appendix  [ app_default ] .",
    "we first attempted to obtain ppem paramater maps of the disc in ht  cas using the short distances of @xmath52  pc estimated by wood et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and marsh ( 1990 ) .    unlike the results of wood et al . , our reconstructions must fit all of the data simultaneously and so suffer less from additional arteficial spatial smearing . using @xmath53  pc we see typical features in the maps arising when too small a distance",
    "was chosen ( appendix  [ app_short ] ) : they show emission in two bright regions along an axis perpendicular to the binary axis with one of them showing a curiously hot pixel .",
    "this is the algorithm s desperate attempt to preserve the width of the eclipse profiles while minimizing the emitting area .",
    "the reconstructed disc using @xmath51  pc would simply produce too much emission if it were axially symmetric .",
    "we could fit the data with a reduced @xmath54 of 2.5 using a distance of 165  pc , but the entropy of the solution is very low compared to the entropies of the maps corresponding to larger trial distances , i.e.  there are more arteficial structures and poorer fits for @xmath51  pc .",
    "reconstructions using marsh s smaller distance are even worse .",
    "otherwise , the reconstructions show similar radial temperature , surface density and derived parameter profiles as wood et al .",
    "( e.g.  a flat 8000  k temperature profile within 0.17@xmath50 except for a nearly optically thick arteficial spot with a temperature of 10000  k ) and a disc radius of 0.35@xmath50 .",
    "the white dwarf is reconstructed with a temperature of about 19300  k , close to wood et al.s @xmath55  k. note that this reconstruction contains disc temperatures which should be reliable ( i.e. are larger than 6300k ) .",
    "the effective temperature is also close to expected values of about 7000  k at small radii .",
    "the optical depths range between 0.1 to 0.2 except near the white dwarf , where they reache values of @xmath330.7 .",
    "given the problems in the reconstructions for @xmath51  pc estimates , we next attempted to find the distance to ht  cas by using the entropy information in the maps ( vrielmann et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we reconstructed the accretion disc maps for a set of trial distances and determined the entropy for a fixed @xmath54 .",

    "a parabolic fit to the function for @xmath56 peaks at 207  pc , a distance which is significantly larger than the previous estimates using the white dwarf or the secondary flux . as a confirmation for this value , in appendix  [ app_long ]",
    "we show the maps using a larger distance of 240  pc showing typical features of too large a trial distance used .",
    "we estimated the error in the ppem distance estimate by performing the test described in appendix  [ app_dist ] using an arteficial disc with a dominant bright spot .",
    "the resulting distance is 2.5% larger than the original one .",
    "this translates into an error of at least @xmath75  pc for our distance of 207  pc .    in the following sections we present the maps and derived quantities using the distance of 205  pc which should effectively give the same results as 207  pc .",
    "we use this distance although it does not agree with previous estimates and although we do accept the smaller distance of 133  pc because  as we will explain in section  [ patchydisc ]  the maps do represent part of the real disc .      despite the simplicity of the hydrogen model",
    ", we find a very good fit to the eclipse light curve , as shown in fig.[htf ] with a @xmath54 of 1.75 .",
    "the residuals ( at the bottom of the plot ) show little correlation , apart from the flickering between phases 0.055 and 0.075 . in the u filter",
    ", this looks like the re - appearance of a bright spot , but the light curves in the filters v and r rather suggest two flares at phases 0.055 and 0.07 .",
    "the residuals between the observed and fitted light curves are at most 5.6% throughout the eclipse ( between phases -0.05 and 0.05 ) , in general largest for the v light curve and smallest for u and b , i.e.  the balmer jump is very well reconstructed .",
    "the larger residuals of the v and r light curves may be due to the lack of line emission in our model , particularly h@xmath5 .",
    "this is also compatible with the r light curve having slightly negative residuals in mid - eclipse .",
    "the reconstructed temperature @xmath37 and surface density @xmath38 distributions ( maps ) are displayed in fig.[htp ] and fig.[htmaps ] .",
    "the most prominent features are the radially decreasing temperature and increasing surface density . however ,",
    "before reliable quantitative results can be drawn from these maps , the ( @xmath57 ) parameter space has to be analysed in a way described in detail in vhh99 .",
    "this analysis shows that both the temperature and surface density values are very well constrained up to a radius of 0.25@xmath50 . for radii",
    "larger than 0.25@xmath50 , the fitted temperatures and surface densities become significantly anti - correlated and hence ambiguous .",
    "since we reconstruct both parameters simultaneously , we can not rely on the exact values of these two parameters for radii larger than 0.25@xmath50 and any derived parameters ( with the exception of the effective temperature , see section  [ sec_teff ] ) . to illustrate",
    "the reliability of the reconstructed values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , fig.[hta ] shows azimuthally averaged parameter distributions with approximate error bars calculated using the assumption that the spectrum at each particular point may vary by up to a @xmath54 of 3 .",
    "this @xmath54 is larger than that of the fit to the data and therefore allows some deviation of the parameters due to mem smearing .",
    "given local values of temperature and surface density , we calculate the specific intensity distributions and find that the inner disc s r - band intensity is 30% of that of the white dwarf .",
    "this drops with radius to 7% at 0.25 @xmath50 , and to less then 1% at 0.4 @xmath50 which we call the disc edge .",
    "the region outside 0.25 @xmath50 contributes so little flux that the data provide only upper limits : the @xmath37 and @xmath38 values found in this range are controlled by the entropy extrapolating the radial @xmath37 and @xmath38 gradients defined by the data for the region inside 0.25 @xmath50 .",
    "the temperature in the inner part of the disc lies at about 9500  k ( with a range of 8500  k to nearly 11000  k ) and drops to about 7000  k at 0.25@xmath50 and to 4000  k at the edge of the disc .",
    "the surface density increases in the same radial range from about 0.013g@xmath6@xmath3  to about 0.026g@xmath6@xmath3  at a radius of 0.25@xmath50 and 0.038g@xmath6@xmath3  at a radius of 0.4@xmath50 . given that the temperatures for @xmath58 are lower than 6300k ,  corresponding to temperatures where our spectral model is bound to underestimate both physical parameters  the true temperatures and/or surface densities are likely to be lower .",
    "thus , we estimate that the outer disc radius is 0.3 - 0.4 @xmath50 .    to obtain a bolometric measure of the optical depth , we compare the spectrally averaged intensity distribution @xmath59 to the black body intensity distribution @xmath60 derived from the reconstructed temperature @xmath37 ( fig.[htbb ] ) . the ratios of the intensities at each radius show that all of the disc has an optical depth of order unity , but the inner parts are more nearly optically thick .",
    "a more quantitative picture is drawn by the spectra of different disc regions as shown in fig.[spec ] .",
    "the parameters are selected according to the azimuthally averaged maps ( fig.[hta ] ) .",
    "while the balmer jump is present in the central parts , it disappears for radii larger than 0.25@xmath50 , because of the low intensity at the blue end of the spectrum .",
    "note that the disc is optically thin at all radii in the b - band , is marginally thin in the v - band , is optically thick in the inner disc in the u - band , and nearly optically thick in the r - band .",
    "the leading side of the inner disc has higher optical depths and so is closer to a black - body radiator .",
    "this coincides with the larger temperature and surface density values seen in fig .",
    "[ htp ] at small radii .",
    "this asymmetry is reproduced in the eclipse profile of the accretion disc . to explain the asymmetry in the light curve",
    ", we seperate the phases in four different ranges @xmath61 with @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 denote the phases of white dwarf ingress and egress , respectively . before the white dwarf",
    "is eclipsed , we see a gradual , linearly sloped disc ingress ( phase range @xmath68 ) . while the central star is obscured , the disc ingress profile is short and rounded , reaching minimum light before phase 0 ( @xmath69 ) .",

    "phases @xmath68 and @xmath70 with the more gradual profiles correspond to the following lune , phases @xmath69 and @xmath71 to the leading , brighter lune of the accretion disc .",
    "hence , the leading lune has a steeper gradient in the parameter distributions than the following lune .",
    "a comparison with a much more symmetric reconstruction of the disc corresponding to a fit to the data with @xmath72 shows that exactly these features in the eclipse profile are responsible for the asymmetric parameter distributions . at this higher @xmath54 level",
    "we see correlated residuals especially inside the white dwarf eclipse profile .    for comparison , we reconstructed the accretion disc using a partially visible white dwarf .",

    "our white dwarf fluxes are smaller than whs s fluxes ( their table 1 ) .",
    "the remaining flux in the bvr filters must originate in the inner part of the accretion disc .",
    "the reconstructed temperature of the white dwarf is 22600  k. this value is larger than wood et al.s ( 1995 ) value of @xmath55  k determined from the same data , because of the larger distance used .",
    "if we use a partially obscured white dwarf ( appendix  [ app_wd4 ] ) we arrive at a white dwarf temperature of @xmath73k , even larger than wood et al.s ( 1995 ) value .    the fact that ppem favours a fully visible white dwarf is problematic , because this means we should expect a substantial hole in the inner part of the disc of the radial size @xmath74",
    "such a hole is not evident in our reconstructions .",
    "however , wood & horne s ( 1990 ) analysis of the white dwarf ingress and egress profiles also favours a fully visible white dwarf or a white dwarf fully covered by a boundary layer , but specifically excludes a white dwarf with @xmath49 and an occulted lower hemisphere .    in our study",
    "we have not specified a location of boundary layer , but expected it to be reconstructed in the inner disc .",
    "since we do not see any indication of a boundary layer in the disc , its temperature must be mixed into the white dwarf temperature , making it in our model indistinguishable from the central object . in this scenario",
    "might lie the solution to the problem , since the boundary layer has a different geometrical and radiative structure than a white dwarf .    the white dwarf or boundary layer appears to have different temperatures at different times , as reported by wood et al .",

    "the white dwarf and/or boundary layer cools down during quiescence when the accretion rate is reduced and is heated up again during an outburst .",
    "since the htcas data were taken 2 - 3 years after the previous outburst , the temperatures derived using @xmath75  pc would appear to be too high compared with those of white dwarfs in similar dwarf novae .",
    "however , the current mean mass - accretion rate does not necessarily reflect the long - term rate , so that high temperatures could principally be due to a previous phase of high mass - accretion rates ( e.g. schreiber , gnsicke & cannizzo 2000 ) .

    "however , it is likely that the covering factor is not constant as assumed in this calculation and that a reconstruction with @xmath70 as a parameter map will result in more realistic solutions ."

    "<S> we have reconstructed the temperatures and surface densities in the quiescent accretion disc in ht  cas by performing a _ physical parameter eclipse mapping _ analysis of archival ubvr observations . using a simple hydrogen slab model and demanding a smooth , maximally artefact - free reconstruction , we derive a formal distance to ht  cas of @xmath0pc , significantly larger than the @xmath1pc we derive from a re - analysis of the data in the literature .    </S>",
    "<S> the accretion disc is small ( @xmath2 ) and moderately optically thin but becomes nearly optically thick near the white dwarf . the temperatures and surface densities in the disc range from 9500k and 0.013g@xmath3 in the center to about 4000k and 0.04g@xmath3 at the disc edge . </S>",
    "<S> the mass - accretion rate in the disc is roughly constant but  at the derived distance  uncomfortably close to those which would prohibit the dwarf nova eruptions .    </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the larger derived distance is probably incorrect but is not produced by inaccuracies in our spectral model or optimization method . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy can be resolved if the emission regions on the disc are patchy with a filling factor of about 40% of the disc s surface . </S>",
    "<S> this solves the problem with the high effective temperatures in the disc  reducing them to around 6500k within a radius of @xmath4  and reduces the derived temperature of the white dwarf and/or boundary layer from 22600 to 15500k .    </S>",
    "<S> the viscosity parameters @xmath5 derived from all reconstructed temperatures and surface densities are of order 10 - 100 and can not be lowered significantly by invoking a lower distance or the filling factor . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is easily explained using the same patchy nature of the emitting material , since the quiescent disc can not consist of optically thin regions alone , but also of a dark and hence cold and dense disc which could easily contain most of the matter . </S>",
    "<S> if we require global values of @xmath5 of order 0.1 , the implied total surface densities are 1 - 100g@xmath6@xmath3   just like those expected for quiescent discs awaiting the next eruption .    </S>",
    "<S> we discuss several possible sources of the chromospheric emission and its patchiness , including irradiation of the disc , thermal instabilities , spiral - wave - like global structures , and magnetically active regions associated with dynamo action and/or balbus - hawley instabilities .    </S>",
