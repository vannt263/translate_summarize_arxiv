    "in lanthanum cobaltite lacoo@xmath0 there is a temperature induced transition from a non - magnetic to a magnetic state , which has attracted considerable interest last years @xcite . in the ground state of lacoo@xmath0 there is no magnetic moment on co ions . at low temperature the magnetic susceptibility increases exponentially with temperature , exhibiting a maximum near 100  k. while initially this maximum was ascribed to a transition from a low spin non - magnetic ground state ( t@xmath1 ,  s=0 ) to a high spin state ( t@xmath10e@xmath11 ,  s=2 ) , later a new scenario involving intermediate spin state ( t@xmath3e@xmath12 ,  s=1 ) has been proposed . using the results of lda+u , korotin _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite explained stabilization of intermediate spin state over high spin state due to the large hybridization between co-3@xmath8  ( e@xmath13 ) and o-2@xmath14 orbitals .",
    "the physical reason for this transition is a competition between crystal - field energy @xmath15 ( t@xmath6-e@xmath7 energy splitting ) and intra - atomic ( hund ) exchange energy @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ goodenough ] ) . in the ground state @xmath15",
    "is only slightly larger then @xmath16 so that the energy of the excited magnetic state of co ion is relatively small and with increasing of temperature its population increases resulting in an increase of magnetic susceptibility .",
    "when la ions are substituted in perovskite cobaltites by other rare earth elements with smaller ionic radii , magnetic properties show significant changes . for ndcoo@xmath0 material @xmath17co knight shift measurements @xcite showed that co ions remain to be in the low spin state up to 580  k , where the gradual metal - insulator transition is observed .",
    "high - temperature diffraction study of lanthanide cobaltite perovskites lncoo@xmath0 ( ln = nd , gd , dy and ho ) @xcite led its authors to conclusion , that `` at room temperature all cobalt ions are in the low spin state regardless of the ln atomic number '' and only as temperature increases to 1000 k `` the possible electronic phase transition can be suggested '' .",
    "magnetic and electric measurements for ho@xmath18ca@xmath19coo@xmath0 system @xcite showed that `` there is no apparent transition between low spin and high spin of co@xmath5 ions in 300 - 900  k temperature range '' .",
    "all these data show that low spin state of co@xmath5 ions in lanthanide cobaltite perovskites with smaller rare earth ions becomes more stable comparing with lacoo@xmath0 and transition temperature increases dramatically . in the present work we have investigated relative stability of low spin and intermediate spin states of co@xmath5 ions in lacoo@xmath0 and hocoo@xmath0 as a function of experimental crystal structure parameters measured at different temperatures . we have found that , indeed , while for lacoo@xmath0 transition temperature value ( defined as the temperature , where calculated total energy of low spin solution becomes higher than the energy of intermediate spin solution ) is 140  k , for hocoo@xmath0 this value is 1070  k. the physical reason for this is decreasing of co - o bond length due to the chemical pressure happening with substitution of la ions by smaller ho ions and hence increasing of the crystal field t@xmath6-e@xmath7 energy splitting value thus stabilizing low spin state .",
    "such conclusion is supported by the results of the recent diffraction experiments under pressure for lacoo@xmath0 @xcite , which were interpreted as `` pressure - induced intermediate - to - low spin - state transition '' .",
    "lacoo@xmath0 crystallizes in the rhombohedrally distorted cubic perovskite structure @xcite . according to the latest crystallographic data by radaelli _",
    "@xcite the space group of this compound is r@xmath20c for all measured temperatures and has two formula units in the unit cell .",
    "main structural motif of this compound is a nearly perfect coo@xmath21 octahedron .",
    "the rhombohedral distortion of the parent cubic perovskite structure can be described by deformation along the body diagonal so that the angle of the co - o - co bond has changed form 180@xmath22 to @xmath23163@xmath22 ( fig .",
    "[ lahoco_cs ] ) .    ' '' ''    hocoo@xmath0 has orthorhombically distorted perovskite crystal structure ( prototype gdfeo@xmath0 , space group @xmath24 ) @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ lahoco_cs ] ) , which contains four formula units in the unit cell . like for lacoo@xmath0 the main crystallographic motif form coo@xmath21 octahedra , which are rotated in @xmath25-plane and tilted in respect to @xmath26-axis . due to smaller ionic radius of ho ion comparing with la ion , distortion from the cubic perovskite structure is stronger for hocoo@xmath0 than for lacoo@xmath0 and the angles of the co - o - co bond have values 149@xmath22 ( in @xmath25-plane ) and 152@xmath22 ( along @xmath26-axis ) .",
    "in addition to the strong bending of the co - o - co bond the average length of the co - o bond is decreased with substitution of la by ho ( 1.934    and 1.921    at 300  k @xcite ) .",
    "such decrease can be understood as a result of chemical pressure , induced by the smaller ionic radius of ho ion comparing with la ion .",
    "the crystal structure parameters as a function of temperature were measured for lacoo@xmath0 in @xcite and for hocoo@xmath0 in @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that lda+u calculations can reproduce a low spin - intermediate spin transition for lacoo@xmath0 using temperature dependent crystal structure as an input .",
    "we used the same procedure for hocoo@xmath0 in order to find if a small decrease of co - o bond length due to the chemical pressure can results in stabilization of the low spin state .",
    "five 3d - orbitals are separated into triply degenerate t@xmath6 and doubly degenerate e@xmath7 subsets only in cubic symmetry lattice .",
    "the rhombohedral crystal structure of lacoo@xmath0 and the orthorhombic crystal structure of hocoo@xmath0 have lower symmetry than cubic as a whole but coo@xmath21 octahedra are only slightly distorted in those compounds . in local coordinate system centered on co ion with the axes directed to the oxygen ions t@xmath6-e@xmath7 orbitals are still well defined . in the following",
    "we have used such defined orbitals for analisys of the calculated electronic structure .",
    "the standard l(s)da ( local ( spin ) density approximation @xcite ) based methods can not describe magnetic state for lacoo@xmath0 without taking into account coulomb interaction between 3@xmath8 electrons as it was demonstrated in @xcite",
    ". however analysis of the lda results is instructive for understanding of the basic electronic structure of lanthanide cobaltite perovskites .",
    "we used lmto method @xcite to perform calculations of electronic structure for lacoo@xmath0 and hocoo@xmath0 .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ lahoco_lda ] .",
    "the radii of the muffin - tin spheres in lacoo@xmath0 for 5  k structure were r@xmath27=3.76  a.u .",
    ", r@xmath28=2.49  a.u . , and r@xmath29=2.0  a.u . with temperature increasing r@xmath28 and r@xmath29",
    "were increased proportionally to co - o distance for a given temperature . in hocoo@xmath0 for lowest temperature ( 300  k ) crystal structure r@xmath28 and r@xmath29 were taken as the corresponding values for lacoo@xmath0 scaled in proportion of co - o distances in lacoo@xmath0 and hocoo@xmath0 . then r@xmath28 and r@xmath29 were increased proportionally to the change of the co - o distance in hocoo@xmath0 for a given temperature .",
    "r@xmath27 was adjusted to fill completely the volume of the unit cell . in the orbital basis",
    "set the following states were included : co(4@xmath30,4@xmath14,3@xmath8 ) , o(3@xmath30,2@xmath14 ) , la , ho(6@xmath30,6@xmath14,5@xmath8,4@xmath31 ) .",
    "partially filled 4@xmath31 states of ho were treated as a pseudo - core states .    ' '' ''    figure [ lahoco_lda ] ( left panel ) shows in details lda calculated electronic band structure of lacoo@xmath0 .",
    "on the top of the figure total density of states ( dos ) is shown .",
    "there are three distinguishable sets of bands : completely filled o-@xmath14 bands , partially filled co-@xmath8 bands and empty la-@xmath31 bands .",
    "the bands in the energy range from -7  ev to -1.5  ev originate mainly from o-2@xmath14 states but have a significant admixture from co-3@xmath8 states . between 0  ev and 2  ev",
    "there are empty la-4@xmath31 bands .",
    "the two groups of bands presented in the third panel , which extend from -1.5  ev to  0 ev and from 0  ev to 2.0  ev , are the co-3@xmath8 states .",
    "also a substantial o-2@xmath14 contributions are apparent in this energy range .",
    "co-3@xmath8 states , due to the octahedral symmetry as we discussed above , are formed by completely occupied t@xmath6 states and empty e@xmath7 states with a `` pseudo - gap '' between them .",
    "the partial densities of states for t@xmath6 and e@xmath7 states are presented in the fourth and fifth panels of fig .",
    "[ lahoco_lda ] , correspondingly .",
    "we have calculated centers of gravity and standard deviations of partial t@xmath6 and e@xmath7 dos ( shown in fig .",
    "[ lahoco_lda ] ) in order to determine the value of crystal field splitting between t@xmath6 and e@xmath7 states .",
    "it was found that t@xmath6 states are 1.93  ev lower than e@xmath7 .",
    "also t@xmath6 band is much more narrow than e@xmath7 .",
    "lda band structure obtained for hocoo@xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "[ lahoco_lda ] ( right panel ) . in general",
    "it is very similar to lacoo@xmath0 bands ( except for the absence of 4@xmath31 band because ho-4@xmath31 states were treated as a pseudo - core ) .",
    "the important difference from lacoo@xmath0 is relative positions of t@xmath6 and e@xmath7 bands of co-3@xmath8 shell .",
    "as one can see from last two panels of fig .",
    "[ lahoco_lda ] ( right side ) , t@xmath6 states are 2.04  ev lower than e@xmath7 comparing with 1.93  ev for lacoo@xmath0 and also e@xmath7 band is more narrow ( standard deviation @xmath32 is 1.45 comparing with 1.59 for lacoo@xmath0 )",
    ". the higher position of e@xmath7 states and the smaller width of the corresponding band result in opening of a small energy gap @xmath90.07 ev .",
    "those results can be well understood from the difference in crystal structure of two compounds .",
    "the values of co - o - co bond angles deviate from 180@xmath22 much more in hocoo@xmath0 than in lacoo@xmath0 .",
    "that leads to a weaker @xmath8-@xmath14-@xmath8 hybridization and hence to a more narrow co-3@xmath8  ( e@xmath7 ) band .",
    "in adition to co - o - co bond bending , substitution of la ion on a smaller ho ion lead to the compression of co - o bond lengths . decreased value of co - o bond length in hocoo@xmath0 comparing with lacoo@xmath0 results in the increased value of hybridization strength between o-2@xmath14 states and co-3@xmath8 states and hence to the increasing of t@xmath6-e@xmath7 energy splitting of co-3@xmath8 states .    for the problem of low spin to intermediate spin state transition the most important is increasing of the t@xmath6-e@xmath7 energy splitting value .",
    "as magnetic transition in cobaltites is determined by the competition between crystal field and exchange energies , this result can dramatically increase excitation energy to the magnetic state and hence increase transition temperature for hocoo@xmath0 comparing with lacoo@xmath0 .",
    "one can estimate the change of excitation to magnetic state energy as equal to the change in the value of t@xmath6-e@xmath7 energy splitting : 2.04 - 1.93=0.09  ev@xmath91000k .",
    "this value must be connected to the transition temperature difference .",
    "we will show below , that this crude estimate agrees surprisingly well with the results of our lda+u calculations .",
    "in the present work we used a general rotationally invariant formulation of lda+u approach instead of the old version used in @xcite . the main idea of the lda+u approach @xcite is to add to the lsda functional the term @xmath33 corresponding to the mean - field approximation of the coulomb interaction in multiband hubbard model ( hartree - fock approximation )    @xmath34=e^{lsda}[\\rho ^\\sigma ( { \\bf % r)}]+e^u[\\{n^\\sigma \\}]-e_{dc}[\\{n^\\sigma \\}],\\ ] ]    @xmath35 is the charge density for spin-@xmath36 electrons , @xmath37 $ ] is the standard lsda ( local spin - density approximation ) functional and coulomb interaction term @xmath33 is a functional of the occupation matrix @xmath38 : @xmath39 here @xmath40 are the elements of the green function matrix in the basis of @xmath8-orbitals @xmath41 ( @xmath42 denotes the cite , @xmath43 the main quantum number , @xmath44- orbital quantum number , @xmath45- magnetic number and @xmath46- spin index ) @xmath47=\\frac 12\\sum_{\\{m\\},\\sigma } \\{\\langle m , m^{\\prime \\prime } \\mid v_{ee}\\mid m^{\\prime } , m^{\\prime \\prime \\prime } \\rangle n_{mm^{\\prime } } ^\\sigma n_{m^{\\prime \\prime } m^{\\prime \\prime \\prime } } ^{-\\sigma } + \\\\\\\\ ( \\langle m , m^{\\prime \\prime } \\mid v_{ee}\\mid m^{\\prime } , m^{\\prime \\prime \\prime } \\rangle -\\langle m , m^{\\prime \\prime } \\mid v_{ee}\\mid m^{\\prime \\prime \\prime } , m^{\\prime } \\rangle ) n_{mm^{\\prime } } ^\\sigma n_{m^{\\prime \\prime } m^{\\prime \\prime \\prime } } ^\\sigma \\ } , \\end { array}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 are the screened coulomb interactions among the _ d _ electrons . finally , the last term in eq .",

    "@xmath52  and  @xmath53 are screened coulomb and exchange parameters  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the usual lsda potential , an effective single - particle potential to be used in the effective single - particle hamiltonian has the form : @xmath54 @xmath55    the matrix elements of coulomb interaction can be expressed in terms of complex spherical harmonics and effective slater integrals @xmath56  @xcite as @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath8 electrons one needs @xmath59 and @xmath60 and these can be linked to the coulomb and stoner parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 obtained from the lsda - supercell procedures via @xmath61 and @xmath62 , while the ratio @xmath63 is to a good accuracy a constant @xmath64 for the 3@xmath8 elements @xcite ( for @xmath31 electrons the corresponding expression is @xmath65 ) .",
    "the coulomb parameter @xmath52 is calculated as a second derivative of the total energy ( or the first derivative of the corresponding eigenvalue ) in respect to the occupancy of localized orbitals of the central atom in a supercell with fixed occupancies on all other atoms @xcite .

    "the main effect of lda+u potential correction ( [ pot ] ) is the energy splitting between occupied and empty states in such a way that the former are pushed down and the latter up comparing with lda . in the result magnetic state solution , which does not exist in lsda , becomes stable in lda+u and by comparing the relative energy of two solutions , non - magnetic and magnetic , one can find the ground state of the system .",
    "we have investigated two solutions for both compounds for all crystal structure parameters corresponding to the temperatures 5 - 300  k for lacoo@xmath0 and 300 - 1080  k for hocoo@xmath0 .",

    "the intermediate state solution gave metallic state in contrast to the semiconductor properties of lacoo@xmath0 .",
