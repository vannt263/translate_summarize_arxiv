    "( [ eq : safe_def_moments ] ) and perform such integration .",
    "divergences contained in both this integral and @xmath15 as @xmath56 will cancel with each other if the same infrared regularization is employed in the two quantities .",

    "the evaluation of the @xmath15 moments at @xmath60 made sense because , up to @xmath39 , this point is unphysical and the moments are well defined through an analytic continuation from the high  energy region .",

    "indeed the correlator of two light quark vector currents has @xmath13 contributions with an internal loop of heavy quarks ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5gluon ] ( a ) ) and , similarly , the asymmetric correlator of a heavy and a light vector quark currents is no longer vanishing at @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5gluon ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the absorptive part coming from the @xmath21 cuts in the previous examples contribute to the phenomenological input @xmath64 in the usual sum rule analysis .",
    "correspondingly they should be accounted for in the theoretical side . in short ,",
    "the production of @xmath21 states concerns not only the correlator of a couple of heavy quark currents and , for a more rigorous use of the sum rules method , this imbalance should be taken into account and properly fixed .",
    "a two  point function built from the sum of the electromagnetic currents associated to each quark flavour could be used in a generalized version of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vacumm ] )  : @xmath65 where now @xmath66 and @xmath67 stand for heavy or light quarks indistinctly , with electric charges @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and @xmath70 is also allowed . as the different absorptive cuts contribute additively to @xmath71 , the unwanted light quark and gluon @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 ,  cuts could be identified and , through the dispersive technique , subtracted from the full @xmath75 result .",
    "consequently we are left with every possible @xmath21 intermediate state arising from vector current production .",
    "notwithstanding , the feasibility of this procedure from a technical point of view appears rather cumbersome and , at present , the experimental accuracy in the measurement of @xmath76 can not accommodate the corrections just discussed .",
    "the general rule given above is valid for all orders of perturbation theory , but it strongly relies in our ability to extract the massless absorptive part from the full result of @xmath5 calculated at a definite order . beyond @xmath39 complete analytical results for the heavy quark correlator would be cumbersome and",
    "only numerical approaches may be at hand . in this sense",
    ", it would be convenient to have a method to calculate @xmath55 only based on feynman graphs .",
    "we have already sketched such a method in the discussion following eq .",
    "( [ eq : piq2 ] )  : we just need to sum up all the massless cut graphs to get @xmath48 , and then proceed with the dispersion integration that gives the associated dispersive part @xcite . for example , at @xmath14 , the only massless absorptive part comes from the three ",
    "gluon cut in the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig:3gluon](a ) ; let us call @xmath77 the amplitude producing three gluons from the heavy quark current at lowest order ( i.e. through the quark triangle loop in fig .  [ fig:4gluon ] ) .",

    "the @xmath38th - derivative of relation ( [ eq : alpha3_reg ] ) respect to @xmath84 , in the limit @xmath85 , would give the infrared divergent contribution that should be subtracted from the full moments , as dictated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : safe_moments_reg ] ) .",
    "this evaluation solves the extraction procedure on the theoretical side .",
    "however the use of moments on heavy quark sum rules involves global quark ",
    "hadron duality which translates into the supposed equivalence between the theoretical evaluation of the moments and the phenomenological input .",
    "the implementation of the latter is not a trivial task . the total experimental cross section @xmath86 can be split into two disjoint quantities  : the cross section for producing hadrons with q  flavoured states , and the production of hadrons with no q  flavoured components .",
    "if the experimental set up was accurate enough to classify events into one of these two clusters , the first class would be the required ingredient for the phenomenological part of the heavy quark sum rule .",
    "however this separation , implemented in the theoretical side within perturbative qcd , is rather involved . up",
    "to @xmath87 there has not been any doubt , in the literature , that contributions to this side arise wholly from @xmath21 cuts in the heavy quark correlator @xmath88 . the physical picture behind this assertion relies in the assumption of factorization between hard and soft regions in the quark production process and subsequent hadronization .",
    "the hard region described with perturbative qcd entails the production of the pair of heavy quarks , and the soft part of the interaction is responsible for the observed final hadron content .",
    "although possible , annihilation of the partonic state @xmath21 due to the later interaction is very unlikely , as jets arising from the short distance interaction fly apart before long  distance effects become essential .",
    "consequently , each jet hadronizes to a content of q  flavoured states with unit probability . as local duality",
    "is implicitly invoked , this picture is assumed to hold at sufficient high energies ; hence perturbative corrections to the hard part are successively included through the heavy quark currents correlator .     _",
    "feynman diagram for the production of three gluons at @xmath89._,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    the same physical picture applied to the three - gluon cut does not allow us to conclude whether this piece should be included or not in the theoretical side of the sum rules .",
    "confinement tell us that this intermediate state hadronizes completely into hadrons with a content of light and/or heavy quarks indistinctly .",
    "it is conspicuous that if we could disentangle the heavy quark hadronization , @xmath90 , we should include only this piece into the sum rule .",
    "then the singularity at @xmath61 would disappear because heavy quarks are produced starting at @xmath91 .",
    "however there is no way to sort out light and heavy quark production off three gluons and , therefore , if we extract this contribution from the heavy quark sum rules we are introducing an incertitude in the procedure because we make sure that there is no light quark hadronization but we miss the heavy quark production .",
    "it is easy to see that the induced error is small , due to the fact that three gluons hadronize mostly to light hadrons .",
    "on one side , in the very high energy region and following perturbative qcd with @xmath92 , we have only a @xmath93 probability of finding a specified pair of heavy quarks produced . and",
    "this is a generous upper limit because when we go down in energy , phase space restrictions severely reduce the counting of heavy quarks .",
    "hence we estimate that excluding the three  gluon cut we introduce a tiny very few percent error in the sum rules procedure .",
    "we have shown that rigorous and straightforward results of the general theory of singularities of perturbation theory amplitudes provide all  important tools to extract the unwanted @xmath14 three ",
    "gluon massless cut pointed out by groote and pivovarov from the vector current correlator of heavy quarks .",
    "we conclude that the appropriate procedure to obtain information about the heavy quark parameters should make use of the infrared safe corrected moments , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : safe_moments_reg ] ) , that now indeed satisfy the modified sum rule  : @xmath94 where the right  hand side can be extracted from the heavy quark production cross section @xmath76 .",
    "finally we have pointed out that , starting already at @xmath13 , the use of sum rules associated to heavy vector current correlators shows and imbalance between the phenomenological input in the dispersion relation and the perturbative two  point function .",
    "this is due to the fact that the cross section of production of @xmath21 heavy quarks is contained not only in the correlator of two heavy quark currents but in those involving light quarks too .",
    "we have indicated how to improve the application of sum rules by constructing a generalized correlator of vector currents in eq .",
