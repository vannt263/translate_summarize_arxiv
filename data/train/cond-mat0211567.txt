    "electron and nuclear spins in semiconductors are promising qubit candidates for quantum computation because their intrinsic quantum two level nature together with existing semiconductor microelectronics technology can potentially satisfy the strict control and scalability requirements of a quantum computer ( qc ) .",
    "hence electron spins in quantum dots ( qd)@xcite and donor impurities@xcite as well as nuclear spins in semiconductors@xcite have been suggested as candidate building blocks for feasible qc architectures.@xcite however , to build such a device major advances in single spin manipulations are needed , and for this purpose realistic calculations of semiconductor spin dynamics are essential to guide the experimental effort currently taking place .",
    "a question of particular importance is whether a localized spin will remain unaffected by the many interactions invariably present in a semiconductor environment during a time interval long enough for fault tolerant quantum computation ( equivalent to @xmath4 quantum gating times.@xcite ) in a recent paper@xcite we showed that spin coherence of bound electronic states in semiconductors is limited by spin - spin interactions at low temperatures .",
    "when this interaction is between the qubits themselves , it can in principle be incorporated into the qc hamiltonian , although this will lead to more complicated gate sequences . in particular",
    "we are not aware of any theoretical qc work specifically working out such gate sequences incorporating inter - qubit interactions .",
    "therefore it is instructive to analyze the error introduced by ignoring some of these interactions , as we did in the case of dipolar coupled spin qubits.@xcite the presence of many non - resonant spins in the system , such as lattice nuclei , also leads to phase fluctuation of the spin qubit , an effect which is hard to control .",
    "this has been denoted spectral diffusion ( sd ) since the qubit zeeman frequency will diffuse through the spin resonance line .",
    "spectral diffusion specifically refers to fluctuations in the zeeman frequency @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the effective @xmath6-factor , @xmath7 the bohr magneton , and @xmath8 the effective local magnetic field ) of the electron due to external effects arising from the semiconductor environment .",
    "note that such fluctuations could arise either because the effective magnetic field @xmath8 is changing dynamically or because the electron @xmath6-factor is varying .",
    "there are many physical processes leading to spectral diffusion , and here we are specifically interested in the limiting processes at the lowest temperatures .",
    "the physical process of interest to us is therefore dipolar nuclear fluctuations .",
    "the first order of magnitude estimate of this effect was applied to si : p donor electrons,@xcite while our recent paper@xcite used the same methods to estimate the sd rate in gaas qds . however , these estimates assumed _ a priori _ that nuclear pairs flip - flopped slowly ( and hence the echo decay was @xmath9 ) with a rate given by an unjustified phenomenological equation [ eq . ( 15 ) in ref .   and eq . ( 8) in ref .",
    "we propose a new description for this decoherence mechanism , arising from dipolar fluctuations of the lattice nuclear spins , affecting the qubit zeeman frequency through hyperfine coupling .",
    "even though we still treat each nuclear pair as an independent markovian random variable ( an approximation which seems reasonable for temperatures well above nuclear dipolar ordering , happening on the nanokelvin scale ) , our new theory describes fast and slow flip - flops on the same footing incorporating motional narrowing effects previously absent in former treatments ( which happens when the fluctuation is so fast that sd is suppressed ) .",
    "we also derive microscopic expressions for these flip - flop rates , leading to a more refined calculation of nuclear sd for gaas qds and si : p donor electrons , together with the first treatment of this effect for a @xmath1p donor nucleus .    in the case of localized spins precessing in a magnetic field @xmath10 ,",
    "knowledge of three phenomenological parameters is sufficient to describe the spin @xmath11 dynamics : the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath12 which determines the precessing frequency ( or equivalently the @xmath6 factor , @xmath13 with @xmath14 the electronic charge , @xmath15 the bare electron mass and @xmath16 the speed of light ) , the longitudinal relaxation time or spin - flip time @xmath17 , and finally the transverse relaxation time or dephasing time @xmath18 , which is often denoted coherence time since it sets the time scale of coherent superpositions between states along the b field direction.@xcite however , electron spins in a solid state environment often have different precession frequencies , either due to hyperfine fields from nearby nuclear spins or from unequal gyromagnetic ratios ( arising , for example , from varying carrier effective mass ) .",
    "therefore the transverse magnetization of a spin ensemble will decay in a time scale @xmath19 which is in general much shorter than the single spin dephasing time @xmath18 .",
    "the latter time scale can be measured using a @xmath20 spin echo sequence.@xcite the time it takes for this echo to decay to @xmath21 of its initial value conveniently defines our single spin coherence time and has been historically called @xmath22 ( spin memory time)@xcite since the echo envelope usually does not decay exponentially as predicted by the bloch equations from which @xmath18 was first defined@xcite ( in appendix b we show that measuring a @xmath20 echo is equivalent to measuring the modulus squared of a single spin off diagonal density matrix element ) .    it has been known for a very long time that sd caused by nearby non - resonant spins is usually the dominant echo decay mechanism.@xcite however , all former sd theories assumed a _ single _",
    "relaxation rate for the non - resonant spins , an approximation perfectly suitable for `` @xmath17 samples '' , whereby these spins change their states through spin - flips only .",
    "the theories of b. herzog and e.l .",
    "hahn,@xcite and later j.r .",
    "klauder and p.w .",
    "anderson,@xcite described the central spin zeeman frequency as a random variable evolving in time according to gaussian and lorentzian conditional probabilities respectively .",
    "these assumptions lead to a @xmath20 echo decay of the form @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively as long as @xmath25 , with @xmath26 being the time interval between the first pulse and the echo .",
    "both @xmath27 ( @xmath28 linewidth for the conditional probabilities ) and @xmath17 ( spin - flip time of non - resonant spins ) are parameters that can in principle be calculated from the interactions . if the condition @xmath29 is satisfied , one obtains @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively , characterizing the motional narrowing regime . interestingly ,",
    "gaussian sd correctly describes motional narrowing since @xmath17 appears in the numerator , but lorentzian sd does not , the decay being independent of @xmath17 .",
    "motivated by this inadequacy of the lorentzian theory , g.m .",
    "zhidomirov and k.m .",
    "salikhov@xcite proposed a many parameter model , which treated the number of flips of a spin @xmath32 during a time interval @xmath33 as a poisson random variable parametrized by @xmath34 , the frequency change on the central spin being @xmath35 .",
    "their theory obtained the correct motional narrowing limit and agreed with experiment in dilute @xmath17 samples where the non - resonant spins are randomly distributed .",
    "our problem , however , is in a completely different regime . here",
    "sd is caused by si and gaas lattice nuclei , which have @xmath17 of the order of hours and hence the relevant time scale is given by the dipolar interaction , which varies substantially depending on the specific pair flip - flopping ( such a system is denominated a `` @xmath18 sample '' , since @xmath36 for the spins that create the sd effect ) .",
    "we generalize the latter theory@xcite to many relaxation rates @xmath37 , each corresponding to a pair @xmath38 of nuclear spins .",
    "we also present a microscopic theory to calculate these flip - flop rates . altogether",
    "this approach is , to our knowledge , the first systematic attempt to describe sd in @xmath18 samples .",
    "we also show that our theory reduces to the earlier simple approximations of refs   in the appropriate limits .",
    "the phosphorus donor impurity in silicon is the textbook example of a localized electron spin in a semiconductor .",
    "it has been extensively studied experimentally using electron spin resonance ( esr)@xcite and successful theories for its gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath17 were developed.@xcite however @xmath22 for p in si remained unexplained , even though it was measured thirty years ago.@xcite our model leads to a @xmath22 two times longer than the measured value ( this agreement should be considered reasonable since existing theories for @xmath17 are also off by a factor of two.@xcite ) our theory predicts a smooth transition of the echo envelope from gaussian sd to motional narrowing behavior , this transition being well described by a correlation function .",
    "if the echo decay of @xmath1p donor nuclei is measured , we predict an echo envelope purely exponential , well into this motional narrowing regime , with @xmath39 s. an important point discussed here is how sd is rapidly suppressed by reducing the amount of nuclear magnetic moments in the lattice .",
    "our calculations show that isotopic purification of si ( exchanging spin-@xmath11 @xmath40si nuclei by spin-@xmath41 @xmath42si ) may lead to coherence times as long as @xmath43 ms for p impurities in si , a result supported by recent experiments.@xcite unfortunately , ga and as nuclei have no stable spin-@xmath41 isotopes , hence it seems that the only way to increase spin coherence in these materials is to suppress flip - flop events by nuclear polarization , as can , for example , be done by applying a strong external magnetic field or by using the overhauser effect .",
    "furthermore , we recently reported the first @xmath22 calculations for a gaas quantum dot.@xcite this was particularly important since @xmath22 has never been measured in this system , and a realistic assessment of the feasibility of a quantum dot quantum computer was needed .",
    "the detailed calculation presented here confirms our previous estimates .",
    "hence the present paper together with other recent calculations of g factor@xcite and @xmath17@xcite available in the quantum dot literature provides a general picture for electron spin dynamics in these heterostructures .",
    "it is instructive to clarify the relationship between our results and recently published theories@xcite on related issues . in ref .",
    "the authors considered a hamiltonian which contained only hyperfine couplings between a single electron and the lattice nuclei , discarding the essential ingredient of the spectral diffusion effect , which is the dipolar interaction between nuclei .",
    "hence their mechanism is based on flip - flops between electron and nuclear spins .",
    "but when a @xmath10 field is applied electron - nuclear flip - flops are forbidden by energy conservation , since the nuclear zeeman energy is @xmath44 times smaller than the electronic zeeman splitting .",
    "therefore their mechanism is only relevant at low @xmath10 fields , when the hyperfine coupling is of the same magnitude or greater than the electronic zeeman energy , leading to the condition @xmath45 g where @xmath46 is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath47 is the electron s probability density on a nucleus .",
    "the theory presented here is valid in the opposite limit , @xmath48 g.    this paper is organized in two parts : general theory and applications . in the first part ( sec .",
    "ii ) we describe our theory of spectral diffusion due to a dipolar coupled spin system .",
    "this general theory can be easily applied to other spin resonance experiments , such as three pulse echoes . in the next part ( sec .",
    "iii ) we give numerical results for three particular cases , and discuss their implications for the current experimental effort in semiconductor spin quantum computation .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "iv with a summary and some general comments .",
    "our problem is to describe the dynamics of a carrier spin @xmath49 coupled to a lattice of nuclear spins @xmath50 .",
    "the total hamiltonian can be separated into three parts : @xmath51 , @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55^{2 } } { |{\\mathbf r}-{\\mathbf r}_{n}|^{5 } } \\biggr\\ } \\label{anintegral}\\\\ & \\approx & \\gamma_{s}\\gamma_{i}\\hbar \\biggl\\ { \\frac{8\\pi}{3}|\\psi({\\mathbf r_{n}})|^{2}\\nonumber\\\\   & & - \\frac{1 - 3\\cos^{2}{\\theta_{n}}}{|{\\mathbf r}_{n}|^{3 } } \\theta(|{\\mathbf r}_{n}|-r_{0})\\biggl\\ } , \\label{an}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath56 here the hamiltonians are divided by @xmath57 to simplify the notation ; @xmath58 and @xmath46 are gyromagnetic ratios , @xmath59 the coupling with a nucleus located at position @xmath60 , @xmath61 the relative vector between two nuclei and @xmath62 the angle between this vector and the @xmath10 field direction .",
    "the electron - nucleus coupling @xmath59 includes a hyperfine term and a residual dipolar interaction .",
    "the hyperfine term comes from the singularity of the integral [ eq .",
    "( [ anintegral ] ) ] , which is removed by integrating over the angular coordinates first . here",
    "we will assume this dipolar term is only effective for @xmath63 , which is a proper length scale for the electron s wavefunction ( @xmath64 is the step function , while @xmath65 the angle between @xmath66 and the @xmath10 field ) .",
    "the nuclear spins are in constant turmoil due to their mutual dipolar interaction . to see how this affects the spin @xmath67 we approximate each nuclear spin operator @xmath68 by a classical random variable @xmath69 , which is valid only if the nuclei have spin @xmath11 ( this description is still accurate for spin @xmath70 , as long as the nuclei are in the slow sd regime , see below ) .",
    "hence the zeeman frequency , @xmath71 , of the electron spin becomes @xmath72 on the other hand , the evolution of the nuclei is strongly affected by the field produced by the central spin @xmath67 .",
    "this effect is treated by assuming the nuclei evolve according to the effective hamiltonian @xmath73 which conserves total spin in the @xmath74 direction .",
    "therefore when any @xmath75 flips , a corresponding @xmath76 must flop in the opposite direction .",
    "these flip - flop events show that we can not treat the random variables @xmath77 as independent of each other .",
    "rather , we will treat pairs of spins as independent random variables .",
    "( [ zeemanfreq ] ) becomes @xmath78 with @xmath79 , and @xmath80 random variables uncorrelated with each other .",
    "we further make the markovian assumption that the probability that @xmath81 changes sign during a time interval @xmath33 is given by @xmath82 , independent of past values of @xmath81 ( this markovian approximation is reasonable in the absence of any contrary evidence about the stochastic fluctuations of the nuclear spins ) .",
    "hence the number of flip - flops @xmath83 is a poisson random variable with parameter @xmath82 , and we may write @xmath84 with @xmath83 having the distribution @xmath85 in the next section we show how to calculate the flip - flop rate @xmath37 .",
    "we now proceed to the derivation of the spin echo decay .",
    "the complex in - plane magnetization @xmath86 can be calculated for any spin echo sequence by taking the average@xcite @xmath87 for the @xmath20 echo considered here the echo function @xmath88 for @xmath89 and @xmath90 for @xmath91 . therefore @xmath92",

    "we distinguish two limits in the above expressions : for nuclear pairs causing fast spectral diffusion , consider @xmath98 .",
    "in that case we have @xmath99 which shows that fast flip - flopping nuclei do not even form an echo .",
    "rather , they contribute to a `` motional narrowed '' signal,@xcite which decays exponentially in a time scale that lengthens as @xmath37 increases .",

    "since this term was introduced heuristically and only changes numerical values by a negligible amount we will not include it here .",
    "notice that nothing should be concluded about the qualitative decay of @xmath108 before performing the product over pairs in eq .",
    "( [ product ] ) .",
    "for example , in the particular case of sd caused by dilute paramagnetic impurities ( @xmath109 with @xmath110 being the impurity - electron distance ) it can be shown that @xmath111@xcite after calculating eq . ( [ product ] ) and taking a spatial average . indeed exactly this behavior was seen in the electron spin echo decay of si : p when the p concentration was high enough such that spectral diffusion due to nearby non - resonant electrons was dominant.@xcite here we deal with even more complicated expressions for @xmath112 [ our eqs .",
    "( [ ansip ] ) , ( [ ansip31 ] ) , and ( [ angaas ] ) ] .",
    "moreover it is often the case that @xmath113 and use of the limits ( [ fastvnm ] ) , ( [ slowvnm ] ) becomes unjustified . hence in our calculations below we perform the product ( [ product ] ) using the exact expressions ( [ vnm ] ) .",

    "( [ correlator ] ) in general does not decay exponentially .",
    "this correlator makes clear the difference between our many parameter ( @xmath118 , @xmath112 ) stochastic theory and these simpler theories .",

    "below we show numerically that this regime leads to @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , when our calculated @xmath123 , we predict a gaussian sd decay for the echo .",

    "in this case we obtain @xmath126 , characterizing a motional narrowing regime since the nuclear bath dynamics may be considered fast .",
    "therefore the importance of our correlation function is to describe the transition to motional narrowing induced by all nuclear pairs , not just a single one satisfying @xmath98 .",
    "it is important to discuss the case of general nuclei with spin @xmath70 , where eq .",
    "( [ sigmanm ] ) does not apply .",
    "then @xmath127 will be a random walk variable with equal probabilities of moving right or left , @xmath128 of course for @xmath70 we can not represent @xmath127 as an analytical function of the number of steps @xmath83 .",
    "however , for small @xmath33 ( such that @xmath129 , or @xmath130 ) eq . ( [ slowvnm2 ] ) will still hold , since @xmath127 will take at most one step ( of length @xmath131 ) .",
    "we will use this fact when considering gaas nuclei , which have @xmath132 ( see below ) .",
