    "one of the major goals of nuclear physics research is to determine the properties and interactions of nucleons and nuclei , and more generally hadrons , directly from the underlying theory of the strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . the only known way to accomplish",
    "this is to numerically evaluate the qcd path - integral using lattice qcd ( lqcd ) in which the space - time continuum is replaced by a finite - volume grid , and the integrals over the fields at each point in space - time are performed using monte - carlo .",
    "the systematic errors introduced by a finite space - time volume , @xmath4 , with a finite lattice spacing , @xmath5 , can be systematically removed by performing calculations in multiple volumes , with multiple lattice spacings and using the theoretical knowledge of the associated functional dependences .",
    "the computational resources that are required for lqcd calculations with light quark masses ( @xmath6 ) near their physical values , with small enough lattice spacings ( @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the scale of chiral symmetry breaking ) , and in large enough lattice volumes ( @xmath9 ) that permit reliable extrapolations and interpolations of phenomenologically important observables are now becoming available with the deployment of multi - peta - flop machines .",
    "while calculating ( post - dicting ) the masses of the lowest - lying hadrons to high precision is computationally demanding ( even without strong isospin breaking and electromagnetism ) , calculating the binding energies of systems composed of the lowest - lying hadrons ( nuclei ) to the same level of precision is significantly more demanding .",
    "for instance , calculating the mass of the proton at the percent level requires precision @xmath10 , while calculating the deuteron binding energy at the percent level requires precision of @xmath11 .",
    "so while the same gauge - field configurations can be used for both calculations , the statistical precision required in the evaluation of the relevant correlation functions differs by orders of magnitude .",
    "further , while the error in the calculation of a hadron mass introduced by the finite lattice volume scales as @xmath12 for large volumes  @xcite , the error in the calculation of a binding energy is largely dictated by the size of the bound state  @xcite .",
    "for instance , for a two - body bound state , the finite volume error scales as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the binding momentum of the state , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the infinite - volume binding energy . for a loosely bound system such as the deuteron ,",
    "the deviation between the ground - state energy calculated in a given lqcd calculation and the actual binding energy will be dominated by the size of the deuteron  . ] and will , in general , be significant except in very large volumes .",
    "these volume modifications arise from the exclusion of single - particle momentum modes in the bound state wavefunction due to the periodic boundary conditions ( bc ) that are imposed on the quark and gluon fields in the spatial directions .    during the last year",
    ", lqcd calculations have observed bound systems of baryons .",
    "evidence for a bound h - dibaryon ( a state with the quantum numbers of @xmath17 ) was found in @xmath18 lqcd calculations with @xmath19  @xcite , and subsequent evidence was found in @xmath20 calculations with @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "also , evidence was reported for @xmath22he , @xmath23he  @xcite and the deuteron  @xcite in quenched calculations with @xmath24 .",
    "the infinite volume binding energy for each of these nuclei was determined by calculating the ground state energy in a number ensembles of gauge - fields with different volumes and then extrapolating to infinite volume .",
    "while the generation of quenched gauge - fields is inexpensive computationally compared to the generation of qcd gauge - fields , the results of quenched calculations can not be used to reliably predict quantities in nature .",
    "an important observation that was recently made by bour _ et al _",
    "@xcite in nonrelativistic systems is that the volume modifications depend upon the momentum of the bound state in the lattice volume , as moving bound states have different momentum modes excluded from their two - body wavefunction .",
    "the implication of this , when extended to quantum field theory , is that the unextrapolated binding energies of composite systems , and in particular light nuclei , calculated with lqcd will depend upon the total momentum of the system .",
    "@xcite were interested in calculating the scattering of bound states in a numerical evaluation of a low - energy effective field theory path integral , and found that the momentum dependent contribution to the two - body ground state energy had to be removed prior to using lscher s method  @xcite to determine the phase - shift .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the quantum field theory formalism established by lscher  @xcite and generalized to moving systems by rummukainen and gottlieb  @xcite , to determine the volume modifications of binding energies of bound systems composed of two spinless particles with s - wave interactions moving in a finite cubic volume , extending the results obtained by bour _ et al _",
    "@xcite in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics . by forming combinations of the ground state energies of two - body systems with different lattice momenta",
    ", volume modifications can be exponentially suppressed in the nonrelativistic limit , and we determine the violations of this exponential suppression . in the case of the deuteron ,",
    "the lowest energy - eigenvalue in the np system with lattice momenta of @xmath25 with @xmath26 allow for the infinite - volume deuteron binding energy to be determined with a volume modification of @xmath27 for @xmath28 , orders of magnitude smaller than in the ground state energy of the @xmath29 system alone .",
    "from a practical standpoint , forming such linear combinations of boosted ground state energies requires significantly smaller computational resources than computing the ground state energies in multiple lattice volumes .",
    "the former can be accomplished with one set of quark propagators on one ensemble of gauge fields , while the later requires generating multiple ensembles of gauge fields and quark propagators on each . in some sense , these linear combinations of binding energies represent an exponential `` volume - improvement '' of the binding energy calculation on a given ensemble of gauge - fields .",
    "an analysis of possible determinations of the deuteron binding energy from a single lattice volume was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite . for a large enough lattice volume",
    ", the energies of the lowest two levels with @xmath29 fall below the t - channel cut , and the effective range expansion ( ere ) of @xmath30 can be used . truncating the ere at the first two terms , which is known to be a good approximation for nucleon - nucleon scattering ,",
    "allows the deuteron binding energy to be obtained by an interpolation .",
    "of course , it is desirable to not make such an approximation in extracting the deuteron binding energy , but this would require more states below the t - channel cut and hence even larger lattice volumes .",
    "for spinless particles of mass @xmath31 and @xmath32 interacting in an s - wave , the scattering amplitude below the inelastic threshold is uniquely specified by the phase - shift @xmath33 , and is proportional to @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the magnitude of the momentum of each particle in the center - of - momentum ( com ) frame . when these two particles are confined to a cubic volume of spatial extent @xmath0 subject to periodic bc s , and with total momentum @xmath36 ,",

    "consequently , the contributions to @xmath77 that scale as @xmath13 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 originate in @xmath84 and are of the forms given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdef ] ) .",
    "it is clear from the explicit expressions for @xmath72 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdef ] ) that linear combinations that provide universal cancellations of finite volume effects in binding energies do not exist in general .",
    "this is due to the appearances of both @xmath44-factors and @xmath49-factors that explicitly depend upon @xmath45 .",
    "the nonrelativistic ( nr ) limit where @xmath90 and neglecting the binding energy compared to the rest mass of the constituent hadrons , @xmath91 , allows for relations to be constructed for a given value of @xmath92 .",
    "corrections to the relations can then be constructed as an expansion in @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the case of equal masses , @xmath55 , is special because @xmath56 for any binding energy and not just in the limit where the binding energy is small compared to the rest masses . in the nr limit it is useful to write @xmath95 where the coefficients @xmath96 for the case of equal masses , @xmath55 with @xmath97 , are given in table  [ table : alpha2 ] and the case where @xmath98 with @xmath99 is given in table  [ table : alpha3 ] .",
    "coefficients @xmath100 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fexp ] ) that determine the leading four finite - volume corrections to the two - body binding energy in the nonrelativistic limit for a system with @xmath55 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     surprisingly , there is little difference between the volume modifications improved to @xmath101 and those improved to @xmath102 for volumes with @xmath103 .",
    "for @xmath28 the @xmath104 , except for @xmath105 , provide estimates of the deuteron binding energy that are significantly closer to its actual binding energy than the ground state of any given @xmath45 spectrum .",
    "the @xmath106 combination is closer to the infinite volume binding energy than one would expect .",
    "while it is improved to @xmath107 it appears to be better than any of the others that are improved to higher orders .",
    "however , this is true only at these `` intermediate '' volumes , while in the very large volumes the predicted hierarchy is , in fact , found . in this combination",
    "there is a subtle cancellation between different volume dependences in the range of volumes that are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : money ] .",
    "while it is important to form the exponentially volume - improved combinations of binding momenta , it may not be the method that is actually implemented in the analysis of the results of lqcd calculations .",
    "the existence of the relations shows that the volume modifications in a prediction of the deuteron binding energy from one ensemble of gauge - field configurations can be exponentially reduced ( in the nr - limit ) with minimal additional computational resources .",
    "however , this reduction can also be accomplished simply by fitting the appropriate volume dependences to the results of the lqcd calculations for a range of @xmath45 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : zkappa ] ) , the binding momentum for any given @xmath45 is @xmath108 with the coefficients and kinematic factors in @xmath109 determined by the lattice calculation .",
    "therefore , up to @xmath101 , the two free - parameters that remain to be determined are @xmath14 and @xmath110 which can be accomplished with a @xmath111-minimization . in the case of having @xmath77 for only two @xmath45 s , @xmath14 and @xmath110",
    "can be solved for within the uncertainties of the lqcd calculations   and @xmath110 in @xmath112 . ] .",
    "as recently stressed by bour _ et al _ , the binding energy of a bound state depends upon its total momentum when subject to periodic boundary conditions in the spatial directions . through the momentum modes excluded by the boundary conditions , these volume modifications of the binding energy depend upon the ratio of the spatial extent of the volume to the lorentz - contracted size of the bound state , and also upon the masses of the constituents .",
    "we have extended the work of bour _ et al _ from nonrelativistic quantum mechanics to quantum field theory and have pointed out that these features can be utilized in lattice qcd calculations of hadronic bound states to ( approximately exponentially ) reduce the volume modifications of predicted binding energies .",
    "the standard lattice qcd methodology that is used to determine the binding energy of a bound state is to measure the ground state energy of a system in a number of lattice volumes and then extrapolate to @xmath113 with a function of the form @xmath114 . using combinations of boosted ground state energies , the volume dependence of the binding energy can be exponentially reduced in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "for instance , the ground state energies of the lowest four boosted states in the lattice volume can be combined to reduce the volume modifications to the predicted binding energy to @xmath115 where @xmath116 .    in the specific case of the deuteron ( neglecting its d - wave component )",
    ", we have numerically explored what might be expected from future lattice qcd calculations , and in particular , examined the volume dependence of combinations of boosted ground state energies .",
    "we find that the deuteron binding energy can be extracted to high precision in reasonably modest volumes , reducing the volume modifications by more than an order of magnitude over those of the state at rest for @xmath117 .",
    "it is also found that the volume modifications to the binding energy of the system with one unit of lattice momentum are significantly smaller than those of other low - momentum states , including the state at rest .",
    "it is clear that future lattice qcd calculations that focus on extracting the properties and interactions of nuclei , including exotic systems such as the h - dibaryon , can greatly enhance the precision of their predicted binding energies by including systems with nonzero total momentum into their production .",
