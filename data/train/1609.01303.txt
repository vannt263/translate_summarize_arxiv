    "it is remarkable that for @xmath34 the system is always stable , while already for very small hund s coupling a large instability zone opens up at large u. upon increasing j , the zone moves towards lower interaction strengths , following the position of the mott transition@xcite while becoming less extended in u : this implies that the maximum extension in density , which in this model is somewhat beyond @xmath66 electrons / site , i.e. the maximum distance of the frontier from the mott insulator , is reached for lower u the higher @xmath35 .",
    "after @xmath67 however the behaviour becomes more articulated , the instability zone expands in all directions until becoming , for the maximum physical value of @xmath68 a wide squarish area between @xmath26 and @xmath69 at all @xmath70 .     of the zone of instability ( in the u - density plane ) in the 2-orbital hubbard model .",
    "at each value the system is unstable for densities between @xmath26 and the corresponding frontier .",

    "in fig . [ fig:5orb ] the calculation of the @xmath9 vs @xmath24 curves is reported , for the 5-orbital hubbard model . as in the 3-orbital case ( fig . 1 in the main article",
    ", right panel ) a double change of slope is visible in most curves , meaning that the instability happens in a finite range of non - zero doping .",
    "this feature , absent in the 2-orbital case , seems to be general for the @xmath37 case .    .",
    "most of the @xmath9 vs @xmath24 curves show a double change of slope in these models , so that the instability zone extends between two spinodal lines both at finite doping . for growing orbitals",
    "the unstable zone extends to larger and larger doping , albeit narrowing in u.,width=302 ]    the phase diagram has thus a very elongated `` moustache '' shape in the u - density plane , as visible in the left panel of fig . 2 in the main article .",
    "it is natural to ask oneself if this unstable zone is a robust physical feature . in particular",
    "it is worth checking if the instability is an artifact of the approximate treatment of hund s coupling due to the chosen density - density hamiltonian .",
    "slave - spins can not at present properly treat the full kanamori hamiltonian at the same approximation level of the ising one@xcite so that we use the rotationally invariant form of the kotliar - ruckenstein slave - bosons @xcite .",
    "thus implicitly we also show that the presented results are not the artifact of the main method chosen throughout this work ( the ssmf ) either .    indeed , in the 2-orbital model , the occurrence of an instability zone due to a diverging compressibility around the half - filled mott insulator is confirmed .",
    "this zone , absent at @xmath34 quickly widens its doping range with increasing j / u and it is most extended for @xmath71 , then decreases again .",
    "the extent in doping is smaller than that for the ising hamiltonian , reaching densities around n=2.1 .",
    "the low - u frontier of the instability zone still departs from the mott transition , as in the ising case .",
    "the shape of the instability zone is analogously re - entrant in both this rotationally invariant and the density density case ( i.e. the fact that the frontier @xmath72 starts at @xmath73 at the critical interaction for the mott transition @xmath74 , quickly grows with @xmath30 , and then decreases again at larger u until vanishing ) .",

    "we have mentioned in the main article that the divergence of the compressibility found in the various studied models departs from the half - filled mott transition , and coincides ( at least close to this transition ) with a cross - over , well known in all models and ab - initio studies of systems with strong hund s coupling@xcite , into a more strongly correlated zone .",
    "this zone is characterized by enhanced inter - orbital local ferromagnetic spin - spin correlations ( i.e. high - spin configurations dominate in the metallic state ) , suppressed inter - orbital local charge - charge correlations ( i.e. charge excitation in different orbitals are decoupled ) .",
    "this last feature causes ( when the symmetry between the different orbitals is broken in the hamiltonian , by e.g. crystal - field , or different hopping ) an enhanced selectivity in the correlation strength , where electrons with some orbital character can be strongly correlated while electrons with some other orbital character are weekly correlated .",
    "this zone can be labeled with the successful buzzword `` hund s metal''@xcite , even if a precise commonly accepted definition of what a hund s metal is not available at the moment .    moving to large dopings",
    "the cross - over becomes less sharp than close to half - filling , and the position of the compressibility enhancement seems not to exactly coincide with it .",

    "<S> hund s coupling is shown to generally favor , in a doped half - filled mott insulator , an increase in the compressibility culminating in a fermi - liquid instability towards phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> the largest effect is found about the frontier between an ordinary and an orbitally - decoupled ( `` hund s '' ) metal . </S>",
    "<S> the increased compressibility implies an enhancement of quasiparticle scattering , thus favoring other possible symmetry breakings . </S>",
    "<S> this physics is shown to happen in simulations of the 122 fe - based superconductors , possibly implying the relevance of this mechanism in the enhancement of the the critical temperature for superconductivity .    </S>",
    "<S> a wealth of unexpected phenomena have been discovered in strongly correlated materials and many technological applications are foreseen . at the heart of the observed remarkable behaviors is the many - body physics of the conduction electrons . </S>",
    "<S> indeed their tendency to avoid each other leads to a complex dynamics with surprising properties , even more so in the typical multi - orbital landscape of these systems . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the different repulsion that two electrons feel depending on them being in the same or a different orbital , or on the alignment of their spins ( embodied by the well known hund s rules of atomic physics ) plays an important role in these materials .    </S>",
    "<S> recently our understanding of the influence of hund s coupling on the metallicity properties of correlated materials has drastically improved@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> three aspects have been singled out as the most influential . </S>",
    "<S> i ) hund s coupling tunes the splitting of atomic multiplets , that affects the distance in energy between the various sectors of atomic states with a given total charge . </S>",
    "<S> this energy is responsible for the local charge fluctuations , in a material , and thus for the ease with which a mott insulating state can occur . </S>",
    "<S> the main outcome is that a mott insulating state is strongly favored when conduction bands arise from an atomic shell which is half - filled . </S>",
    "<S> ii ) hund s coupling typically lowers the overall coherence of conduction electrons , especially for electron densities near half - filling . </S>",
    "<S> iii ) it also favors the differentiation of the correlation strength among the conduction electrons . </S>",
    "<S> this was termed `` orbital decoupling '' @xcite , since it stems from hund s coupling suppression of orbital fluctuations , favoring selective mott physics depending on the orbital character of the conduction electrons . </S>",
    "<S> this can cause the coexistence of electrons with different correlation strength .    </S>",
    "<S> all of these results have been consistently found in iron - based superconductors and related materials ( see for example @xcite for i),@xcite for ii ) , @xcite for iii ) ) thus testifying the importance of electronic correlations in these compounds in accord with theoretical studies@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however these materials are fermi - liquids at low temperature@xcite and their instabilities ( magnetism , superconductivity ) have been consistently modeled within weak - coupling theories@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of electronic correlations on the high - t@xmath0 superconductivity is at present still not understood .    </S>",
    "<S> here we show that multi - orbital correlations and hund s coupling in particular seem to have another , hitherto undiscovered , influence on these systems , in that not only the quasiparticle weight and masses but also the residual interactions between quasiparticles can be affected in a highly non - trivial way . </S>",
    "<S> this happens in the zone of influence of the aforementioned half - filled mott insulator . </S>",
    "<S> we show that hund s coupling affects these interactions enhancing the compressibility of the electron fluid , up to a point in which the system is unstable towards phase separation . besides the many implications that an intrinsic instability towards a phase separation can entail , it is worth stressing that simply these altered quasiparticle interactions can have direct effects on the interaction vertices with low - energy bosons and radically enhance some bosonic - mediated mechanisms towards long - range ordered phases </S>",
    "<S> . we will show that this might be the case for the pairing mechanism for the high - tc superconductivity in fe - based superconductors .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the multi - orbital hubbard model ( with m orbitals ) with hamiltonian @xmath1 with h_0 = _ </S>",
    "<S> ijmm t^m m_ij d^_imd_jm+_im_mn_im , where @xmath2 creates an electron with spin @xmath3 in orbital @xmath4 on site @xmath5 of the lattice , and @xmath6 the number operator is @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the chemical potential , and customarily we set @xmath10 and we drop the last two terms in @xmath11 ( spin - flip and pair - hopping ) , which needs extra approximations to be treated within our method of choice ( the effect of these terms is addressed in the supplemental material ) . </S>",
    "<S> we first study the degenerate model in which we only consider diagonal hopping in orbital space , equal for all orbitals i.e. @xmath12 and @xmath13 , as a function of the average density of electrons per lattice site @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> we treat the model in the slave - spin mean - field approximation@xcite ( ssmf ) and we focus on the to normal , non - magnetic , zero - temperature metallic phase . there </S>",
    "<S> the ssmf describes the metal as a fermi - liquid by construction , yielding the following quasiparticle hamiltonian : [ eq : qp_ham ] h - n= _ km ( z+- ) f^_kmf_km where @xmath15 is che creation operator of a quasiparticle with momentum @xmath16 , orbital ( band ) character m and spin @xmath3 and @xmath17 is the bare electronic dispersion relation which is the same for all the bands . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> the k - space structure of @xmath17 is immaterial , and only the density of states ( dos ) counts ; we customarily choose a semi - circular dos @xmath18 of bandwidth @xmath19 for all bands . </S>",
    "<S> the renormalization parameters of the dispersion , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , are calculated in the self - consistent ssmf scheme as an average on the auxiliary slave - spin hamiltonian@xcite which treats explicitly the interaction term eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ham_kanamori ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> they thus embody the effect of the electronic interactions determining the quasiparticles : @xmath20 is the quasiparticle weight and - in this family of methods that yield a purely local electronic self - energy - also the inverse of the mass enhancement , while @xmath21 is a shift of the bare on - site energy . the fermi liquid condition @xmath22 is built - in .    </S>",
    "<S> we wish to study the compressibility of the electronic fluid @xmath23 as a function of hund s coupling and the number of orbitals in the model . </S>",
    "<S> we thus calculate the @xmath9 vs @xmath24 dependence in these models within ssmf . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mu_vs_n ] ( left panel ) the result for the 2-orbital hubbard model at a typical value of hund s coupling @xmath25 is reported for various values of u. remarkably , approaching the half - filled mott insulator ( that is realized at @xmath26 , for @xmath27 ) the slope of the @xmath9 vs @xmath24 curves vanishes and then becomes negative , signaling a sizable zone in the u / doping ( from half - filling , i.e. @xmath28 ) plane where the system is unstable .    : @xmath9 vs @xmath24 curves for different values of u. in the 2-orbital case for @xmath29 at half - filling ( @xmath26 , in this model ) the system undergoes a mott transition . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore the compressibility can become negative both going through zero and through a divergence . the second case is realized here , implying a strong enhancement of the compressibility in the thermodynamically stable zone near the frontier . </S>",
    "<S> the compressibility being the uniform and static charge response function , a divergence in this quantity signals an instability of the system toward phase separation into macroscopic charge - rich and charge - poor zones ( which in practice will be prevented by a charge modulation at finite q due to long - range coulomb interaction , neglected in this study@xcite ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : phasediag - mech ] ( left panel ) : it departs from the mott transition and has a non - monotonous behaviour as a function of the interaction strength , so that the unstable zone widens rapidly for @xmath30 , but at larger interactions ( for @xmath33 in this case ) it narrows again .    </S>",
    "<S> hund s coupling is essential for this instability zone to appear , no diverging compressibility is found at @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> already at very small @xmath35 a wide zone opens at large u. this zone moves towards lower interaction strengths for increasing @xmath35 , following the position of the mott transition@xcite at half - filling , from which the instability frontier always departs . </S>",
    "<S> the zone extends , for typical values of @xmath35 , in the range n=2 to 2.2 ( and symmetrically by respect to half - filling n=2 , since the model is particle - hole symmetric ) , becoming larger only for @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the complete study as a function of @xmath35 is presented in the supplementary material .    </S>",
    "<S> a similar behavior is found for the 3-orbital ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mu_vs_n ] , right panel ) and 5-orbital model ( shown in the supplemental material ) . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference with the 2-orbital case is however that a second frontier can be traced , at smaller doping compared to the first , where the @xmath9 vs @xmath24 curve recovers a positive slope . </S>",
    "<S> this signals that the instability due to the compressibility divergence now mostly happens in a range of finite doping ( and that the system can remain stable near the mott insulator ) . </S>",
    "<S> the region ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phasediag - mech ] , left panel ) still departs from the mott transition at half - filling , but then extends in the u - doping plane until the two lines merge , having thus a `` moustache '' shape in the @xmath37 cases , instead of an `` onion '' shape like in the @xmath38 case . </S>",
    "<S> it is comparatively less extended in u but more extended in doping . </S>",
    "<S> in particular in the 5-orbital model it approaches values close to n=6 densities . at n=6 </S>",
    "<S> the system is stable again , but still an evident signature of this physics in terms of enhanced compressibility is present .    despite a marked difference , then , in the way the instability zone evolves at large u , the common robust feature is that in all these models the onset of hund s coupling triggers the appearance of a zone departing from the mott transition at half - filling where the system is unstable towards phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> the low - u frontier of this zone in all cases is rather horizontal in the u - doping plane , i.e. for @xmath30 it moves quickly towards the maximum doping it will reach . </S>",
    "<S> this frontier is found to follow a well known crossover , appearing in these models in several physical quantities . </S>",
    "<S> indeed ( see for instance fig.16 in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) along a line departing from the mott transition@xcite , at finite doping one observes for increasing u or doping moving towards half - filling : a quick decrease of the quasiparticle weight z , an increase of the inter - orbital spin - spin correlations , and a suppression of the inter - orbital charge correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the crossover is very sharp near the mott transition , whereas it becomes progressively broader with increasing doping . at finite temperature </S>",
    "<S> it is identifiable with the `` spin - freezing cross - over''@xcite , and the recent successful denomination of `` hund s metal''@xcite might be used for the zone at large u - small doping . </S>",
    "<S> the three mentioned quantities then have a different , and rather disconnected evolution in other zones of the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> this crossover is where the compressibility divergence is empirically found to appear for increasing interaction u in all cases ( as explicitly shown for selected cases in the supplemental material ) . </S>",
    "<S> the re - entrant shape of the instability zone suggests a closer analogy with the zone of reduced inter - orbital correlations , however , which is the only quantity among the three showing a similar shape in its crossover at large u @xcite .    . </S>",

    "<S> since for the compressibility to diverge when z is finite ( as we indeed find here ) it must be @xmath51 , and thus @xmath52 at least negative , this last formula implies that @xmath53 has to be negative , since @xmath54 is always positive ( indeed z diminishes upon approaching the half - filled mott insulator , so that its slope has always the sign of @xmath55 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is confirmed numerically ( see supplemental material ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the compressibility divergence always happens because @xmath53 becomes negative and larger in absolute value than @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the last quantity is always small near the mott insulator ( because z and @xmath55 are small there , and @xmath57 is finite ) but the question remains of why @xmath58 .    indeed the renormalization parameters z and @xmath21 set respectively the width and the position of the quasiparticle band(s ) , compared to the non interacting case . in particular in a doped mott insulator @xmath21 places the quasiparticle band above the charge gap in the so - called hubbard band@xcite , the range of the spectrum with delocalized excitations at finite energy . </S>",
    "<S> the hubbard band is centered around the energy of the atomic charge excitation ( e.g. : u/2 in the single - band case ) and if its width is fixed one expects lambda to grow monotonously when shifting the quasiparticle band within it , upon doping . </S>",
    "<S> it has however become clear recently that the hubbard bands can vary in width , for instance among different models : in absence of hund s coupling their width grows like @xmath59 with the number of orbitals@xcite , while it was shown that the onset of hund s coupling @xmath60 reduces their width back to values of the order of the one - band model@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed @xmath60 quenches the orbital fluctuations responsible for the enhancement of the delocalization energy of the charge excitations , and hence of the width of the hubbard bands . </S>",
    "<S> this quenching is however complete only at half - filling , while the extra particles introduced by doping necessarily create doubly occupied orbitals , unquenching the orbital degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> one can then expect the hubbard bands to expand again , when doping the half - filled mott insulator . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a plausibility argument for the non - monotonic behaviour of @xmath21 with @xmath24 : if the hubbard band expands quickly enough with doping it may happen that for a larger density @xmath24 the quasiparticle band is located at lower energy than for a smaller @xmath24 ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : phasediag - mech ] , right panel ) , and consequently @xmath9 can be lower for the larger @xmath24 , causing the negative compressibility that we find .    </S>",
    "<S> incidentally the mechanism reducing the width of the hubbard bands was shown to coincide@xcite with the one causing the `` orbital - decoupling '' ( i.e. the suppression of inter - orbital charge - charge correlations ) leading to the selective mott physics that one finds in these models once the degeneracy of the bands is removed@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is not surprising then to find the divergence of the compressibility on the frontier of the cross - over towards the orbitally - decoupled region .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth stressing that also the proximity to such a fermi - liquid instability has several remarkable consequences@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed a negative @xmath61 implies an attractive interaction between quasiparticles in the particle - hole channel , at @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> this in general favors superconductivity@xcite . but also </S>",
    "<S> the interaction of quasiparticles with low - energy bosons can be enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> indeed ward identities relate the quasiparticle interaction vertices with the fermi - liquid parameters . </S>",
    "<S> for instance for the density - vertex @xmath63 the following ward identity holds@xcite : z(q0 , = 0)=. this implies an enhancement of this interaction vertex , if @xmath64 decreases until vanishing as in the present case ( for a complete plot of @xmath64 in the 2-orbital model with @xmath25 in the supplemental material ) . in turn </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement of the vertex can favor a symmetry breaking , if a related susceptibility is correspondingly enhanced .    </S>",

    "<S> when modeling doped bafe@xmath65as@xmath65 with dft+slave - spin one finds confirmation that the phase separation instability is realized also in this realistic framework , emanates from the half - filled mott insulator , and reaches the zones in the phase diagram relevant to the iron - based superconductors , as shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> , j / u=0.25 ) that yields the correct sommerfeld coefficient for all of the 122 family@xcite one finds that the compressibility is greatly enhanced in the density range 5.75 to 6.1 , coinciding with the zone where doped bafe@xmath65as@xmath65 shows high - tc superconductivity in the tetragonal phase .    </S>",

    "<S> the zone of phase separation is compatible with the corresponding zone we find in the present study and with its continuation in terms of enhanced compressibility . </S>",
    "<S> what we highlight in the present work is that this phase is a genuine instability of the fermi liquid phase even in absence of all symmetry breaking , it is to be tracked back to hund s coupling , and is a universal feature of all hund s dominated doped half - filled mott insulators .    </S>",
    "<S> analogously to the model studies , we find that in bafe@xmath65as@xmath65 the instability zone and the zone of enhanced compressibility that continues it , is located on the cross - over frontier between the normal and the orbitally - decoupled ( `` hund s '' ) metal ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , right panels ) . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that in general an enhancement of the compressibility , with the possible related enhancement of superconductive pairing , happens when a material is near the frontier between a normal metal and a hund s metal . </S>",
    "<S> a possible universally detectable sign of this situation is the arising of high - tc superconductivity in between a phase with orbitally - selective electronic correlation strength and another , more conventional metallic phase , as it also happens in cuprates@xcite .    </S>",
