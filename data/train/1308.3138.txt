    "galactic black hole ( bh ) sources are interesting objects to study as these sources are observed only in binaries and the process of accretion gets very complex as the disk evolves with time , especially when the sources undergo outbursts and jet ejections take place .",
    "some of the bh binaries show persistent emission ( e.g. cyg x@xmath11 ) along with aperiodic x - ray variability ( e.g. grs 1915@xmath0105 ) , over more than a period of decade . some bh sources show outbursting behaviour for shorter duration varying from few days to months , and",
    "are called as outbursting bh sources or transients ( e.g. gx 339@xmath14 , xte j1118@xmath0480 , xte j1748@xmath1288 , h 1742@xmath1322 , gro j1655@xmath140 ) . the outbursting bh sources show different types of intensity variations ( i.e. , outburst profile ) over different period of time @xcite .",
    "some of the sources after being quiescent for a long time , show a sudden increase in the intensity level , and attain a maximum intensity within few days and then decay back slowly to quiescence ( h 1743@xmath1322 , a 0620@xmath100 , 4u 1543@xmath147 ) .",
    "their light curves have a ` fast rise and exponential decay ( fred ) ' profile .",
    "some sources have a slow rise to the peak and decay slowly to the quiescence ( gx 339@xmath14 , xte j1752@xmath1223 ) and their light curve profile is termed as ` slow rise slow decay ( srsd ) ' . during this whole phenomena ,",
    "outbursting sources show different spectral and timing variabilities and exhibit different spectral states like _ hard , hard - intermediate , soft - intermediate , soft state _",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) and in some cases a _ very high state _ also ( @xcite , @xcite ) , in their hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) .",
    "it is also observed that in outbursting bh sources , strong jets are emitted which are seen in radio observations @xcite , during the transition from hard - intermediate to soft - intermediate state in the rising phase ( e.g. h 1743@xmath1322 , @xcite ) and in the declining phase when the source transits from soft - intermediate to hard state ( e.g. xte j1752@xmath1223 , @xcite ) .",
    "quasi - simultaneous multiwavelength observations of sources like gx 339@xmath14 @xcite , xte j1748@xmath1288 @xcite , h 1743@xmath1322 @xcite , strongly suggests that the radio flares emitted are associated with the disk emission . it has been reported from the study of grs 1915@xmath0105 that , during the jet ejections , qpos are not observed as well as the comptonized component gets suppressed ( @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the ` hot ' comptonized corona gets disrupted and evacuated , and the source spectra softens , suggesting that the x - ray emission is mostly from the disk ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray transient source xte j1859@xmath0226 was first discovered @xcite with all sky monitor ( asm ) onboard rossi x - ray timing explorer(rxte ) @xcite on oct 9 , 1999 .",
    "subsequently , the source was monitored in x - rays with rxte / pca ( proportional + counter array ) and cgro - batse ( compton gamma ray observatory - burst and transient source experiment ) for several months @xcite .",
    "the outburst showed the typical fred profile .",
    "spectral and temporal characteristics confirmed the source as a black hole candidate @xcite .",
    "several observations in optical and radio wavebands confirmed the presence of the counterpart of the source @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic studies of the counterpart showed weak emission lines arising from balmer series of hydrogen and he ii , which is typical for spectra of lmxbs @xcite .",
    "the mass function was estimated to be ( 4.5 + /-",
    "0.6 ) m@xmath2 , and an assumed inclination angle of 70@xmath3 gave a lower mass limit of 5.42 m@xmath4 @xcite .    during the 1999 outburst ,",
    "the source xte j1859@xmath0226 was continuously and extensively monitored in x - rays and in radio , which revealed the x - ray / radio correlations @xcite .",
    "the source is observed to exhibit multiple flaring events of five in number . from the study of the spectral evolution in radio , it was found that the jet generation is implied by the production of hard x - rays and also that a correlation exists between soft x - ray and radio ejection during the first flare , while a correlation existed between hard x - ray and radio observation during the other ejections .",
    "@xcite studied the temporal properties of the source and found that , the qpos observed can be classified into three types viz .",
    "type a , b and c. this classification scheme based on the qpo characteristics and phase lag , has been considered as one of the basic formalities to classify the qpos in black hole sources ( see also @xcite ) . the phase lag difference between different types of qpos , suggests that the shape of oscillation is different in different energies .",
    "but the evolution of low frequency qpos ( c - type ) as well as their origin during the initial rising phase of the outburst is still not clear .    in the context of disk - jet symbiosis of black hole sources ,",
    "@xcite have provided a unified picture along with the estimation of jet power as a function of x - ray luminosity .",
    "their work also highlighted the occurrence of five radio flares in xte j1859@xmath0226 and suggested that all the flares occur when the source is in a similar spectral state .",
    "they found that the rms of the power density spectra ( pds ) reduces during the occurrence of a flare .",
    "@xcite studied the spectral properties of the source during its rising phase and found that the non - thermal flux ( 2 - 50 kev ) remains constant during the first flare of the source .",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of the source during the rising phase of the outburst and found that there is a signature of partial absence of the qpo ( or comptonized corona ) , when the first radio flare occurred .",
    "@xcite studied the spectral behaviour of this source in the context of global study of disk dominated states of several bh sources . considering a simple phenomenological model ( diskbb+powerlaw ) for bh spectral study",
    ", @xcite showed that a large fraction of disk dominated observations of xte j1859@xmath0226 fall below the ` standard ' luminosity - temperature ( l - t ) relation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite has studied the spectral characteristics of the source based on bepposax and rxte observations , in the context of a bulk motion comptonization model ( bmc of xspec ) , and have observed an evolving high energy cut - off component during the hard to soft transition .",
    "they have also performed a correlated study between the fraction of comptonization and the rms variability .",
    "but the ` complex ' evolution of fold energy since the beginning of the outburst along with the evolution of temporal features ( qpos , rms etc . ) , especially during a radio flare are not explained in detail .",
    "so , in order to have a coherent study of the evolution of temporal and spectral properties of the source ( during the entire outburst ) as well as the implications on disk dynamics during the multiple ejections , we re - analysed the rxte pca / hexte temporal and spectral data of the source xte j1859@xmath0226 in the energy band of 2 - 150 kev .",
    "several models have been proposed to understand the ` spectro - temporal ' evolution of an outbursting black hole binary . the accretion - ejection instability model @xcite and global disk oscillation model @xcite attempts to explain the origin of qpos .",
    "recently , @xcite based on propagating mass accretion rate fluctuations in hotter inner disk , and @xcite based on oscillations from a transition layer in between the disk and hot comptonized flow have proposed alternative models to explain the origin of qpos",
    ". there have been other attempts also to understand the hard x - ray spectral state variations @xcite as well as state transitions across the hid @xcite of the outbursting bh sources .",
    "but none of these models , addressed as a whole the issues of evolution of low frequency qpos as well as soft and hard x - ray spectral components , and spectral state changes across the hid during the entire outburst . on the other hand , quite independently , several alternative models ( see  4 for discussion ) and more recently the phenomenological model @xcite have been put forward only for understanding the disk - jet symbiosis in bh sources .",
    "so , we attempted to understand the evolution of temporal and spectral properties associated with the different branches of the ` q - diagram ' of the outburst of the source xte j1859@xmath0226 within a single framework of the two component advective flow ( tcaf ) model @xcite . basically , this model consists of two different types of accreting flow @xcite : sub - keplerian ( i.e. , freely falling and less viscous flow ) and keplerian ( i.e. , moves in circular orbit and high viscous flow ) matter @xcite .",
    "we also delve deep into the nature of the accretion dynamics during the jet ejections of this source based on the detailed temporal and spectral x - ray properties .    in general ,",
    "outbursting black hole sources show signature of evolution of qpo frequencies @xcite , which could be explained based on the propagating oscillatory shocks solution @xcite of tcaf model . in this work",
    ", we provided the solution of evolution of qpos during the rising phase and possible explanation of the ` reverse ' nature of the evolution of the hard spectral component ( i.e. , the fold energy ) , which can be interpreted with the shock acceleration mechanism @xcite in the sub - keplerian flow .",
    "our findings show that the qpos are not observed during the radio flares , which we have explained with the possible scenario of ` evacuation / disruption ' of the comptonized corona .",
    "we attempt to estimate the mass of the source by modeling the qpo evolution and also from the correlation between qpo frequency and photon index @xcite .",
    "the preliminary results of our findings were presented in @xcite .",
    "this paper has been organized in the following manner : in the next section , we discuss the observations and the procedures applied for data analysis using the standard packages for rxte pca / hexte . in  3 , we presented the results obtained from the temporal and spectral analysis for the whole outburst , estimation of mass in  3.2 , followed by specific spectral and temporal characteristics during each radio flare in  3.3 . in  4 , we discuss the possible physical scenario to explain the evolution of x - ray properties observed during the entire outburst of xte j1859@xmath0226 and the disk - jet connection , and summarize our conclusions .",
    "we analysed the public archival data obtained from the heasarc database for the rxte satellite to study the characteristics of the source xte j1859@xmath0226 over the entire duration of the single outburst which occurred during the entire rxte era .",
    "we analysed the pca ( 2 - 25 kev ) and hexte ( 20 - 150 kev ) data spanning 166 days since october 9 , 1999 ( mjd 51460.76 ) to march 23 , 2000 ( mjd 51626.6 ) .",
    "we excluded the observations of july 2000 when the source was in quiescence , as the counts were very less .",
    "the standard ftools package of heasoft v 6.11 was used for data reduction . for spectral and temporal analysis purposes",
    ", we used the packages xspec v 12.7 and xronos v 5.22 respectively .",
    "for the timing analysis , we used the science data of pca in the binned mode ( b_8ms_16a_0_35_h_4p , fs37 * ) of maximum time resolution of 8 ms which spans over 0 - 35 channels , and event mode ( e_16us_16b_36_1s , fs3b * ) of 16 @xmath5s time resolution for 36 - 249 channels .",
    "we used the ftools task _ xtefilt _ to create filter file , and _ maketime _ to generate a good time interval ( _ gti _ ) file , with conditions of _ elevation angle @xmath6 10@xmath7 , offset of @xmath8 0.02 and time since saa passage @xmath8 30 min_. since it was not possible to select the data only for a single pcu from the binned mode data , we decided to extract light curves for all pcus .",
    "light curves were generated in various energy bands of 2 - 6 kev , 6 - 13 kev , 13 - 25 kev and 2 - 25 kev in order to perform an energy dependent study of the pds . since the binned mode data consisted of only 0 - 35 channels ( 2 - 13 kev ) , we generated the light curve of minimum binning time , for the channel ranges 0 - 15 ( 2 - 6 kev ) and 15 - 35 ( 6 - 13 kev ) , using _ saextrct_. the light curve from the event mode data was created using _",
    "seextrct _ for the minimum available binning time , and the data belonging to channel range of 36 - 67 ( 13 - 25 kev ) was extracted from the total available channel range of 36 - 249 .",
    "a combined light curve for 2 - 25 kev was obtained , by summing up the light curves from 0 - 35 channels ( 2 - 13 kev ) and 35 - 67 channels ( 13 - 25 kev ) , using _",
    "lcmath_. since the contribution of background counts were very less ( 8.6 counts over 2674 source counts at the peak of the outburst and 6.6 counts over 61.9 source counts at the minimum ) , we did not subtract the background counts while generating the light curve .",
    "for the spectral analysis , we decided to extract data for pcu2 only , since throughout the entire outburst only pcu2 remained ` on ' and the efficiency of the detector also holds good .",
    "the source spectra were extracted from the standard2 data product ( fs4a * ) , which has a time resolution of 16 sec .",
    "background spectra were obtained with the help of _ runpcabackest _ , applying the background model for bright source and saa passage history file obtained from the pca background web - page of rxte for the corresponding epoch during which the source has undergone outburst .",
    "spectral response was created using the _ pcarsp _ tool .",
    "we also generated the background subtracted light curve for pcu2 counts for the energy range 2 - 6 kev , 6 - 20 kev and 2 - 20 kev , in order to plot the hid .",
    "we extracted high energy ( 20 - 150 kev ) spectral data mostly from cluster a ( fh52 * ) of hexte , since specific observation by cluster b ( fh58 * ) had lesser counts , except for initial two days ( mjd 51462.76 and mjd 51463.83 ) , where there were no cluster a observation . using standard procedures",
    ", we generated the deadtime corrected source and background spectra , and spectral response was generated using _",
    "hxtrsp_.    radio observations were carried out in the bands of 1.43 ghz , 1.66 ghz , 2.25 ghz , 3.9 ghz by various observatories ( vla , merlin , gbi , ratan ) during the outburst of the source , and the combined radio light curve was presented in @xcite .",

    "from the lightcurves generated , we used the ` powspec v 1.0 ' of the xronos package and the customized software based on idl , _ general high energy aperiodic timing software _",
    "( ghats ) v 1.0.1 . while using ` powspec ' , a normalisation factor of ` -2 ' was applied in order to subtract the expected white noise level from the data , to obtain the squared rms fractional variability from the integral of the pds .",
    "further analysis shows that the factor of ` -2 ' deviates about 0.5% in almost all states except the soft - intermediate states where it deviates by 3% to 5% .",
    "the ghats package considers dead time effect and hence the correct value of normalisation factor ( as in @xcite ) while generating the pds .",
    "the available minimum time binning factor of 0.0078 sec , which corresponds to a nyquist frequency of 64 hz , was chosen over 8192 segments .",

    "we also studied the evolution of pds in different branches of hid of the outburst .",
    "the phase lag between soft ( 2 - 6 kev ) and hard ( 6 - 25 kev ) photons during the flares was estimated using ghats .",
    "the lightcurves and hence the fast fourier transforms for the 2 - 6 kev and 6 - 25 kev energy bands are generated .",

    "we followed the standard procedures of the ghats package to estimate the lag ( see also @xcite & figure [ lag - f3 ] of this work ) .",
    "we performed a simultaneous fit of the pca and hexte data for the energy range of 3 - 150 kev , including a constant factor close to unity for normalising both the spectra . in order to get an idea of the normalising factor we estimated the factor by simultaneously fitting the crab spectra ( since it does not vary with time ) observed by rxte during the different spectral states of xte j1859@xmath0226 ( observation ids 40093 - 01 - 12 - 00 and 40093 - 01 - 15 - 00 ) .",

    "we modeled the energy spectra using the standard accretion disk models ( _ diskbb _ and _ powerlaw _ ) for bh spectra , modified by the _ phabs _ model to account for the interstellar absorption . from an initial fit to the data sets during the entire outburst , we found that the nh parameter has an average value of 0.2 @xmath11 10@xmath12 atoms @xmath13 and fixed this value for further analysis .",
    "this value of nh , agrees well with the average value of 0.216 @xmath11 10@xmath12 atoms @xmath13 , estimated by the leiden / argentine / bonn ( lab ) survey , and the dickey & lockman ( dl ) survey value of 0.221 @xmath11 10@xmath12 atoms @xmath13 ( ) .",

    "the width of the gaussian was fixed at 0.7 kev ( varies between 0.62 kev and 0.88 kev ) which was obtained as an average to all the fits ( except for the hard states ) .",

    "the x - ray observation @xmath10 24 hrs before ( mjd 51466.896 ) the radio flare peak on mjd 51467.9 , shows the presence of a type c qpo of 5.97 hz . for the next observation ( mjd 51467.581 ) which is 7 hrs before the flare peak we performed energy dependent study in narrower bands ( 2 - 4 kev , 2 - 5 kev , 2 - 6 kev etc . ) and found that the power spectra for 2 - 5 kev and 13 - 25 kev bands does not show any signature of qpo . a broad 7.79 hz type a qpo",
    "is observed , only above 5 kev as evident in the 6 - 13 kev pds with rms amplitude of 3% , which is typical for type a qpos .",
    "so , in the overall range of 2 - 25 kev , a broad qpo of 7.79 hz is observed ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "we also observe that the total rms of the pds reduces ( see also @xcite ) to a value of 2.7% when the qpo is not observed .",
    "since the qpo was not observed in the soft band of 2 - 5 kev , we have shown the variation in the pds over 2 - 5 kev in figure [ f1 - 2 - 5-kev ] , for observations before and after the flare peak .",
    "similar variations in the power spectra of 13 - 25 kev band also observed ( not shown in figure ) .",
    "it is seen that , before the flare occurred i.e. , when the qpo was observed , the hard photons slightly lag behind the soft photons .",
    "7 hrs before the flare peak , the 2 - 5 kev soft photons are lagging compared to 5 - 25 kev hard photons . when the qpo is observed again in the pds , the hard photons",
    "are observed to lag the soft photons .",
    "we also note that before the flare peak , the photon index increased to 2.51 , disk temperature increased from 0.88 kev to 1.06 kev ( table [ tabflares ] and figure [ spec - evo_f1234 ] ) and the fold energy of the electrons increased from 151 kev to 201 kev .",

    "the 3 - 20 kev flux is found to be more than the 20 - 150 kev flux , by a factor of 5 ( figure [ flux - evo_ratio ] ) , suggesting the soft nature of the spectrum .",

    "after the flare , the photon index decreased to 2.42 and disk flux reduced to 7.83 @xmath11 10@xmath94 erg @xmath13 s@xmath45 .",
    "this implies the hard nature of the spectrum although the disk temperature was around 1.07 kev and the fold energy had reduced to 156 kev .",
    "thus the broad qpo seen ( just 7 hrs before the flare peak ) in the 6 - 13 kev band while not in 2 - 5 kev and 13 - 25 kev , implies that the qpo is ` partially ' observed ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "the weak presence of qpo on mjd 51488.41 and mjd 51488.48 , was followed by a complete absence of qpo in the power spectra of mjd 51489.47 along with softening of the spectra .",

    "radio observations also show that the flux decreases to @xmath10 1 mjy and later the source becomes non - detectable .",
    "we find that , there is a radio brightening ( see @xcite ) on mjd 51499.10 ( after 16 hrs of x - ray obs . ) of flux of 7.9 mjy ( figure [ rlc - pca ] ) , implying the possible signature of occurrence of a flare ( f6 ? ) that could have triggered on or before this time .",

    "we observed that during the rising phase ( hard and hard - intermediate states ) the qpo frequency of type - c increases as both the disk and powerlaw flux increases , implying a positive correlation . during the soft - intermediate state ( branch cd )",
    "the type b qpos are observed to be correlated with the powerlaw ( non - thermal ) flux but not with the disk flux .",
    "a few type c qpos detected during the soft - intermediate state ( branch cd ) are observed not to show any correlation with the powerlaw flux .",
    "figure [ flux - qpo ] also shows that a few of the type c * qpos have a correlation with the disk flux but are not at all correlated with the powerlaw flux as indicated by the random variation .",
    "only very few type a qpos are observed , and hence it is not possible to find any correlation with disk or powerlaw flux .",
    "the evolution of temporal and spectral properties of the source xte j1859@xmath0226 during the 1999 outburst suggest that the source does evolve via different spectral states throughout the outburst .",
    "detailed analysis during the multiple ejections ( i.e. , radio flares ) reveals that the ejections are possibly associated with the comptonized corona , and hence the sudden ` appearance ' of such radio flares or ` jets ' could be because of some instability happening in the comptonized corona .",
    "although several attempts have been made to understand the evolution of ` spectro - temporal ' characteristics as well as the ejection events observed in outbursting bh sources , till date , there is no comprehensive picture for the 1999 outburst of xte j1859@xmath0226 .    in this paper",
    ", we attempted to understand the possible accretion dynamics associated with the evolution of various x - ray features of xte j1859@xmath0226 , in the context of two component advective flow ( tcaf ) model ( @xcite ) . according to tcaf , the compton cloud ( formed in shocked accretion phase ) is nothing but the sub - keplerian matter dominated centrifugal pressure supported boundary layer ( i.e. , cenbol ) , which intercepts soft photons , mostly originated from the keplerian disk , and the cenbol up - scatters them via inverse comptonization to produce high energy photons .",
    "the cenbol forms due to shock transition in the flow and its surface may oscillate due to the oscillation of shock , which could be responsible for the generation of qpos ( @xcite , see references therein ) .    during the rising phase , we observed a monotonic increase of qpo frequency ( c type ) from 0.46 hz to 5.84 hz in both hard and hard - intermediate states .",
    "this happens because , the shock location propagates towards the bh and the size of the shock formed region i.e. , the cenbol surface or region of comptonization , ( which is oscillating ) reduces , and hence the qpo frequency increases ( @xcite ) .",
    "we estimated the shock location ( size of cenbol ) based on the pos solution ( see  3.3 ) . during this period , the instantaneous shock location ( see figure [ qpo - pos ] ) and",
    "hence the ` compton cloud / cenbol ' varies from 114.7 r@xmath95 to 28.7 r@xmath95 . using the same solution",
    ", we also estimated the size of the cenbol region , before and after the flare .    during the soft - intermediate state",
    ", the qpo frequency ( all types of qpos ) varies in between 6 hz to 8 hz , and this implies that the size of the corona / cenbol remains almost constant ( i.e. , shock location varies between 21.1 r@xmath95 to 17.5 r@xmath95 ) .",
    "we also found that qpos in the soft - intermediate state are sporadic in nature i.e. off ( qpo not observed ) and on ( qpo observed again ) , which could be linked with jet ejection ( see figure [ qpo - evo ] and below for discussion ) . during the declining phase of soft - intermediate ( except during the ` secondary ' emission of outburst ) , hard - intermediate and hard states , qpos are hardly observable , whereas for other bh sources like gx 339@xmath14 , h 1743@xmath1322 , xte j1550@xmath1564 qpos are observed during all the spectral states ( except soft states ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite evoked the idea of the diffusive propagation of perturbation in the disk like configuration of keplerian ( as extended disk ) and sub - keplerian ( inner part of the disk as ` compton ' cloud ) matter distribution @xcite , to understand the different noise component in the power spectra .",
    "so , it could be possible to explain the evolution of total rms as well as modeling the broadband power spectra of different branches of hid of xte j1859@xmath0226 , in the context of tcaf model , although detailed modeling of evolution of the power spectra of the source is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the evolution of the hid ( figure [ q - dia ] ) shows that during the rising phase , the source was initially in the hard state ( region ab ) , and the variation of the spectral parameters , suggest that the spectra is mostly dominated by the sub - keplerian component ( i.e. , larger ` compton ' cloud ) with negligible contribution from the keplerian disk . as the source moves towards the hard - intermediate state",
    "( implied by figures [ q - dia ] and [ spec - evo_f1234 ] ) , we observe that thermal flux increases relatively more than the non - thermal flux ( figure [ flux - evo_f123 ] ) and both are correlated with the increase in frequency of type c qpos ( see figure [ flux - qpo ] ) .",
    "this implies that the keplerian flow starts increasing along with the sub - keplerian flow , which is still dominating over the keplerian in the hard - intermediate state ( bc of hid ) . as a result ,",
    "the energy spectra become softer and the size of the cenbol also starts decreasing ( see figure [ qpo - pos ] ) .",
    "this is evident from the increase of qpo frequencies during the hard - intermediate state .",
    "it is observed that as the source move from hard to hard - intermediate states , the fold energy also ( see figure [ fold - ene ] ) increases ( increase in cut - off energy during hard to soft transition was observed by @xcite ) .",
    "the increase in fold energy seems to be quite ` unnatural ' compared to other bh sources , like gx 339@xmath14 and xte j1550@xmath1564 , where figure 6 of @xcite and figures 1 and 2 of @xcite respectively , pointed out the monotonic decrease of cutoff energy during the rising phase .",
    "it seems that the shock acceleration mechanism , which converts fraction of thermal electron to the non - thermal electron within the compton cloud , becomes more important as the source evolves in this phase , and hence the fold energy increases although the source spectra becomes softer and softer .",
    "similar kind of behaviour is observed in the hard and soft state spectrum of cyg x@xmath11 , which has been modeled using shock acceleration mechanism in tcaf @xcite .",
    "it has to be noted that the kink observed around @xmath96 day during the rising phase ( see figure [ qpo - pos ] ) , when the qpo frequency changes from 3.05 hz to 3.64 hz , is peculiar in sense that at the same time there is an abrupt change in the photon index from 2.05 to 2.2 along with an increase in disk flux from 0.42 @xmath11 10@xmath94 erg @xmath13 s@xmath45 to 0.7 @xmath11 10@xmath94 erg @xmath13 s@xmath45",
    ". this could be possible due to sudden change in the accretion flow dynamics during this phase .    during the soft - intermediate state ( cd &",
    "ef ) the evolution pattern of hid is complex .",
    "we find that the photon index varies in between 2.5 to 2.1 and disk temperature varies around 0.9 kev , whereas variation of diskbb and power - law flux is not at all correlated ( see figure [ flux - evo_f123 ] ) .",
    "this unnatural variation of flux occurs in short time - scales ( few hrs to day scales ) .",
    "also , the fold energy varies randomly about an average value of 130 kev within 1@xmath18 error limits , whereas the change in fold energy during rising phase is well above the 2@xmath18 error limit .",
    "this could be due to multiple ejections that have taken place , and they are directly associated with the disk dynamics .",
    "we observe all types of qpos during this phase of which the b - type qpo correlates with power - law flux whereas its variation is random with disk flux and hence no correlation exists .",
    "c - type qpos are correlated with the disk flux but does not show any specific correlation with the power - law flux .",
    "so , it is possible that sub - keplerian flow plays a major role ( to generate various types of qpos , relation between various types of qpos with flux ) compared to the keplerian flow , as the ` hot ' compton cloud evolves faster ( i.e. , less viscous ) than the keplerian disk .",
    "we could observe a short presence of a ` soft state ' during branch de for a few observations ( see figure [ q - dia ] ) where the hardness ratio is of @xmath100.1 and total rms of pds @xmath10 1% to 2% without any signature of qpo . during this phase ,",
    "the keplerian flow is supposed to dominate over the sub - keplerian flow to produce ` softest ' spectrum .",
    "as observed , the energy spectra is dominated by thermal emission ( see figure [ flux - evo_ratio ] ) but harder in nature ( disk temperature also less ) compared to the soft - intermediate state ( see figure [ spec - evo_f1234 ] and [ spec - evo_f5 - 6 ] ) .",
    "hence , the observed state could not be a ` canonical ' soft state .",
    "this could be possible due to enhancement of sub - keplerian flow during this time that makes the spectra harder along with the strong presence of keplerian flow ( i.e. , thermal emission ) .",
    "it can be understood in the context of tcaf model that , the multiple ejections during the soft - intermediate state restrict the disk to become keplerian dominated flow since the ejections are coupled with the comptonized corona , which is mostly sub - keplerian in nature .    while the source continued in the soft - intermediate state ( branch ef ) , there is an indication of weak increase in x - ray intensity ( ` secondary ' emission ) of around 24 days with peak emission on @xmath24 day of the outburst ( see figure [ rlc - pca ] ) .",
    "the monotonic increase in qpo frequencies ( see figure [ qpo - evo ] ) and increase in other spectral parameters ( figure [ spec - evo_f5 - 6 ] , [ flux - evo_f123 ] and table [ secondary ] ; see also @xcite ) , indicate that there could have been sudden increase in keplerian as well as in sub - keplerian flow during the declining phase of the outburst , which results as a weak ` secondary ' emission .",
    "the weak presence of soft state and the weak ` secondary ' emission , makes the hid different from the ` standard ' evolution pattern of other outbursting sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    at the end of the outburst ,",
    "the source transits from soft - intermediate to hard via hard - intermediate state before reaching the quiescence phase .",
    "the photon index starts decreasing , with a very weak signature of thermal emission ( figure [ spec - evo_f5 - 6 ] and [ flux - evo_f123 ] ) , which implies that the emission component is again dominated by sub - keplerian matter over keplerian matter .",
    "the modeling of the hid ( i.e. , q - track , see also @xcite ) which follows the evolution of x - ray features of the outburst , and of the broadband spectrum ( 3 - 150 kev ) will be carried out using tcaf model and will be presented elsewhere ( @xcite ) .",
    "results of the modeling ( see  3.2 ) of qpo evolution based on pos solution and @xmath26-qpo correlation suggest that the mass of the source is @xmath10 6.58 to 8.84 m@xmath2 .",
    "this matches well with the previous estimate of the mass as 7.7 @xmath56 1.3 m@xmath2 by @xcite",
    ".        the sudden occurrence of a radio flare can be due to some disturbance in the disk system , which results in ejection of the material as jets .",
    "several attempts have been made until now , to explain the phenomena of jet ejection in bh binaries ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "study of the jet emissions , using mhd simulations were carried out by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these models suggest that the corona is like a windy hot material which blows away as jets from the inner regions of the accretion flow . in this work",
    ", we attempted to explain the ejection mechanism based on dynamics of magnetic flux tube inside the tcaf ( see figure [ mtcaf ] ) as described by @xcite .",
    "when the ejection takes place due to the collapse of magnetic flux tube , the cenbol gets disrupted and the matter is ejected as a jet . as a result , oscillation of the cenbol ( i.e. , shocked surface ) ceases and hence , the qpos will not be observed in the pds .",
    "the energy spectra shall be dominated by thermal emission from the disk , as the matter from the cenbol ( ` hot ' electron ) is ejected .",
    "the fold energy is observed to increase just before the flare and decrease just after the flare .",
    "this could be the possible indication of ` disruption ' of the corona / cenbol .",
    "the subsequent observation of qpo and spectral hardening in a time scale of few hours to days suggest that the matter flows in sub - keplerian disk forming the compton cloud / cenbol responsible for qpo generation .",
    "as the observations suggest that the companion is of k - type @xcite and hence magnetically active , it is possible that the strong magnetic field anchored with the matter is continuously fed into the disk system during the rising phase of the outburst .",
    "hence , during the transition from hard to soft - intermediate state , the field gets sheared and stronger ( in the form of toroidal flux tube ) and disrupts the comptonized corona ( in different time scales ) , resulting in multiple ejections at different time - scales .    for the flare f1",
    ", we observe a type c qpo of 5.97 hz which corresponds to a cenbol size of 21.2 r@xmath95 . during the partial absence of the corona ( i.e.",
    ", qpo is not observed in 2 - 5 kev and 13 - 25 kev bands ) @xmath10 7 hrs before the flare peak , we observe a 7.79 hz qpo at a shock location of 17.8 r@xmath95 . since the sub - keplerian flow moves in shorter time scale it takes less duration of time to form the cenbol again , which starts oscillating .",
    "hence qpo of 6.1 hz ( type b ) is observed 2 hrs after the flare peak at a shock location of 20.9 r@xmath95 .",
    "thus , a duration of 9 hrs ( maximum ) was required for the cenbol to get disrupted and form again .    during flare f2 , a 7.7 hz type c",
    "* qpo is observed at 17.9 r@xmath95 around 21 hrs before the flare peak . but within 7 hrs",
    ", the sub - keplerian component ( as the flow is less viscous ) has formed the corona and the oscillations of 5.87 hz ( type b ) are re - stored at 21.4 r@xmath95 . a closer look into the pds evolution ( figure [ pds - f2 ] ) shows that the qpo frequency increases with diminishing power , before the flare occurs and the qpo is not observed ( see  3.3.4 ) . the qpo was again observed before the radio flare peak , which seems to be inconsistent as compared to other flares , where we observe a complete absence of qpo before the radio peak .",
    "we observe similar characteristics in other sources like xte j1550@xmath1564 , where the time gap between qpo being not observed and the flare peak was more than 24 hrs ( @xcite ) .",
    "so , it is possible that the process of evacuation of the cenbol is rather slow during f2 , and hence the ejected material took long time to peak as a radio flare . by that time , the corona is formed again to reproduce the qpos , which are interestingly of _",
    "cathedral type_. as we mentioned , the qpo and jet formation are coupled with the comptonized corona , which is sub - keplerian in nature .",
    "hence , the disk - jet coupling mechanism in f2 , which seems to be ` complex ' in nature ( ` spectro - temporal ' properties are totally different from other flares ) could be because the dynamics ( i.e. , the amplification of magnetic field , motion of tube etc . ) of flux tube within the cenbol are different .",
    "it requires further investigation to study the coupling between flux tubes and sub - keplerian flow and hence to understand the ` complex ' disk - jet symbiosis .",
    "but , for both the flares f1 and f2 , the disruption of the inner part of disk and its re - filling time required for oscillation of cenbol , is around 7 to 9 hrs .",
    "so , it is evident that within the hours time - scale only the sub - keplerian matter can easily move in , whereas the keplerian flow does not since it moves in viscous time - scale .    before the peak of flare f3 a 7.24 hz type c * qpo",
    "is observed corresponding to the cenbol size of 18.6 r@xmath95 . when the qpo is observed again at 4.87 hz ( type b )",
    "the shock location is 24.3 r@xmath95 .",
    "we find that , the disruption and refilling time of the inner disk ( formation of oscillating cenbol ) is @xmath10 3 days .",
    "it is possible that the magnetic field would have been strong enough ( i.e. , continuous collapse of flux tube ) to disrupt the disk repeatedly , resulting in multiple signature of radio activity ( see bottom panel of figure [ rlc - pca ] ) . during this long disruption process ,",
    "no lags in soft to hard photons are observed , disk temperature remains almost constant with increased disk flux and the fold energy decreases .",
    "these indicate that the ` hot ' compton cloud is ejected in the form of jets . as the source is also in the declining phase ,",
    "the matter supply in both the form of keplerian and sub - keplerian flow has reduced and hence , took longer duration to form the inner - part of the disk for the oscillation of the cenbol to start again .    during f4 , before the flare peak the qpo was observed at 4.43 hz ( type b ) and the cenbol size is of 25.9 r@xmath95 . when the qpo is observed again",
    "its frequency is 6.97 hz ( type c * ) at 19.1 r@xmath95 . before f5",
    ", we observed a significant qpo of 4.7 hz ( type c * ) at 24.9 r@xmath95 followed by weak indication of 7.3 hz qpos ( type c * ) at 18.2 r@xmath95 , and after the flare the qpo is again observed with frequency of 5.02 hz ( type c * ) at 23.8 r@xmath95 .",
    "the flares f4 and f5 occurred when the source was in the declining phase of the outburst , where the sub - keplerian flow dominates . while in decay the rate of incoming matter ( both the keplerian and sub - keplerian ) from the companion reduces , and hence the strength of the magnetic field also reduces .",
    "so , we notice that the radio flares observed have less peak flux as compared to previous flares .",
    "although there are no radio observations during the flare f5 ( see @xcite ) , the results we obtained (  3.3.5 ) suggest that the flare would have probably occurred after the day reported by @xcite . as a result , during both the flares",
    ", the disruption and refilling time of inner part of the disk ( formation of oscillating cenbol ) is longer of around 30 hrs for f4 ( with a possibility of secondary emission after @xmath10 16.8 hrs with radio flux of @xmath10 8.9 mjy as shown in figure [ rlc - pca ] ) and 10 days for f5 respectively .",
    "we found a possibility of occurrence of another radio flare ( i.e. , f6 ) on or before mjd 51499.10 with radio flux of @xmath10 7.9 mjy .",
    "there is an indication of qpo not being observed after the peak radio flux . as there is lack of x - ray and radio observations during this time ,",
    "it is not possible to pinpoint the exact time of flare ejection .    above",
    "discussions on all the flares suggest that the radio flare take different time to peak and qpos are not observed during the flares .",
    "the re - filling time scale ( @xmath10 few hrs to days based on available data ) to form oscillating cenbol ( corona ) resulting in qpos , also suggests that the accretion flow could be sub - keplerian in nature .",
    "similar study of the disk - jet connection based on the magnetized tcaf model has been earlier presented for grs 1915@xmath0105 by @xcite .",
    "we observe that the type of qpo is independent of the ejection event ( see  3.3 and column 10 of table [ tabflares ] ) .",
    "the results mentioned in  3.3 clearly show that the qpos observed before and after the flare , need not be of specific type .",
    "but , the prediction of jet ejections ( without any radio detection ) , based on qpos being observed or not in the power spectra , requires further studies in the context of tcaf model which could be possible after detailed investigation of x - ray observation of other outbursting sources .",
    "we have also observed similar characteristics ( but with no definite relation between the types of qpos before and after the ejection ) in other bh sources . in the case of xte j1550@xmath1564 , gro j1655@xmath140 and xte j1752@xmath1223",
    ", we found that the qpo observed before and after the flare are of type c. for h 1743@xmath1322 , we observed a type c qpo before the ejection and the pds showed a type b qpo after the ejection .",
    "so , in the present scenario , it is not possible to generalise or establish a relation between types of qpo and flare ejection events .",
    "although , there were attempts to establish the link of b type qpos with radio flare , along with the drop in rms in the power spectra ( see @xcite ) .",
    "detailed study on qpo types and radio flares will be performed for several bh sources ( based on available x - ray and radio data ) ( @xcite ) .    due to the complex behaviour of qpos during ejection events , we presented in  3.4 how different types of qpos are correlated with the flux variations",
    ". the variation of type b / c qpos w.r.t disk and powerlaw flux is not similar to that observed for gx 339@xmath14 by @xcite , where both type b and c qpos are correlated with the disk and powerlaw flux ( see figures 5 and 8 in @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ flux - qpo ] also shows that the type c * qpos have a weak correlation with the disk flux but does not have any correlation with the powerlaw flux , and a similar characteristic was observed for gx 339@xmath14 by @xcite .",
    "type a qpos do not show any correlation with flux for gx 339@xmath14 , while xte j1859@xmath0226 has only very few type a qpos , which limits the results . @xcite and @xcite observed a positive correlation between qpo frequency and disk flux during the rising phase ( for gro j1655@xmath140 , xte j1550@xmath1564 , h 1743@xmath1322 ) , which is also observed for xte j1859@xmath0226 .",
    "an opposite correlation was observed between qpo frequency and powerlaw flux for gro j1655@xmath140 , while a positive correlation was observed for xte j1550@xmath1564 and h 1743@xmath1322 .    in the present work",
    ", we have not explained the origin of different types of qpos before and after the ejections . according to tcaf model , the base of the jet and origin of qpos both",
    "are directly coupled with the cenbol dynamics .",
    "recently , we have done simulation to show that the mass loss from the disk and origin of qpos in bh are linked with the cenbol ( @xcite , see references therein ) .",
    "so , it could be possible to address the types of qpos during the ejections , as the qpo generation in tcaf model depends on the sub - keplerian flow characteristics ( i.e. , viscosity , angular momentum , energy etc . of the flow ) .",
    "this work which involves detailed simulation ( sph and tvd based ) is under progress and would be presented elsewhere .",

    "preliminary results on the presence and absence of qpos associated with flaring events for several outbursting black holes have been presented in @xcite .",
    "based on the findings of ` spectro - temporal ' evolution of the source xte j1859@xmath0226 , we can summarize that :    * the source evolved through various states in hid with a sequence of _ hard @xmath21 hard - intermediate @xmath21 soft - intermediate @xmath21 soft state ( not ` canonical ' ) @xmath21 soft - intermediate @xmath21 hard - intermediate @xmath21 hard states _ before reaching to the quiescence phase .",
    "multiple radio ejections ( or the enhancement in sub - keplerian flow ) might have stopped the source to evolve from soft - intermediate to ` canonical ' soft state . * the qpo frequency increases monotonically during the rising phase of the outburst .",
    "the evolution is modeled with pos solution to estimate the size of the ` compton ' corona .",
    "similar kind of variation is also observed in other outbursting bh sources . *",
    "results from the modeling of the qpo evolution and @xmath26-qpo correlation suggest that mass of the source could be between 6.58 m@xmath2 and 8.84 m@xmath2 . *",
    "the temporal evolution of the pds shows that the qpos are not observed , during the ejection as observed in radio . * during f1 , no qpo is observed in the soft band of 2 - 5 kev ( also not in 13 - 25 kev band ) , but a broad qpo of less amplitude is observed in the 6 - 13 kev band .",
    "this implies that there has been a ` partial ' absence of the qpo in 2 - 5 kev and 13 - 25 kev bands . * during f2 , f3 , f4 and f5 , we find that the qpos are not at all observed in the pds . *",
    "the qpo frequency observed before and after the flare need not be of same type during all the flares . * during all the ejections , the x - ray spectrum gets soften and fold energy ( @xmath97 ) decreases , as the ` hot ' electron cloud ( corona ) gets disrupted and spectrum is dominated by disk emission . only in the case of f2 ,",
    "@xmath97 increases , the evacuation process seems to be complex . * ` disruption ' of inner part of the disk ( corona / cenbol ) occurs as a resultant of dominant thermal emission over non - thermal flux resulting in qpos being not observed .",
    "this could be due to the ` catastrophic collapse ' of toroidal flux tube of strong magnetic field in the hot region of sub - keplerian flow .",
    "* during the declining phase , the source might have undergone a ` secondary ' outburst observed as a weak x - ray flaring activity for @xmath10 24 days . * due to lack of continuous x - ray observation during the flare time , it was not possible to tighten the duration of disruption and refilling time scale .",
    "so , it is required to have more precise and simultaneous observation in _ radio - uv - x - rays _ to provide better picture of disk - jet dynamics in outbursting sources . in this context , continuous monitoring of outbursting sources with india s upcoming multi - wavelength satellite astrosat along with gmrt , vlbi etc",

    "<S> we re - investigated the ` spectro - temporal ' behaviour of the source xte j1859@xmath0226 in x - rays during its outburst phase in 1999 , by analysing the rxte pca / hexte data in 2 - 150 kev spectral band . </S>",
    "<S> detailed analysis shows that the source evolves through different spectral states during its entire outburst as indicated by the variation in the spectral and temporal characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> although the evolution pattern of the outburst followed the typical q - shaped profile , we observed an absence of ` canonical ' soft state and a weak presence of ` secondary ' emission during the decay phase of the outburst . </S>",
    "<S> the broad - band spectra , modeled with high energy cutoff , shows that the fold - energy increases monotonically in the hard and hard - intermediate states followed by a random variation in the soft - intermediate state . </S>",
    "<S> we attempted to estimate the mass of the source based on the evolution of quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) frequencies during rising phase modeled with the propagating oscillatory shock solution , and from the correlation of photon index and qpo frequency . </S>",
    "<S> it is also observed that during multiple ejections ( observed as radio flares ) the qpo frequencies are not present in the power spectra and there is an absence of lag in the soft to hard photons . </S>",
    "<S> the disk flux increases along with a decrease in the high energy flux , implying the soft nature of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> these results are the ` possible ' indication that the inner part of the disk ( _ i.e. , comptonized corona _ ) , which could be responsible for the generation of qpo and for the non - thermal comptonized component of the spectrum , is disrupted and the matter gets evacuated in the form of jet . </S>",
    "<S> we attempted to explain the complex behaviour of ` spectro - temporal ' properties of the source during the entire outburst and the nature of the disk - jet connection before , during and after the ejection events in the context of two different types of accreting flow material , in presence of magnetic field .    </S>",
