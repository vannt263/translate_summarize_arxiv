    "this is in contrast to the setup of the main text , where the antidots are offset laterally .",
    "the edge states propagating around the antidots are propagating in different directions , due to the fact that one layer consists of holes and the other electrons .",

    "the top layer is effectively `` glued '' to the bottom layer , in the sense that a quasiparticle from the top layer can coherently propagate into the bottom layer at low energies .",

    "recall that the setup in the main text possesses @xmath85 parafermion zero modes at the ends of the tlj @xcite .",
    "the physical consequence of this is that at the location of the parafermion zero modes , excitons ( quasiparticle - quasihole pairs from different layers ) can be absorbed or emitted . in the current electron - hole setup",
    ", there is no special point where quasiparticle - quasihole pairs from the different layers ( excitons ) can annihilate ( this can happen anywhere along the line junction ) , and there are therefore no localized zero modes .",

    "the edge states can be gapped in two ways : either ( 1 ) through normal backscattering , which will heal the fqh fluid on either side of the junction into a uniform fqh fluid , or ( 2 ) through cooper pairing terms that are induced through proximity effect from a nearby superconductor . in the second case ,",
