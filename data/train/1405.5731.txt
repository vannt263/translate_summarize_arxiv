    "the nature of high - velocity turbulent motions of ionized gas in giant star - forming regions and dwarf galaxies has been studied for almost half a century , starting with @xcite , who showed that the velocity dispersion , @xmath0 ( the rms velocity along line - of - sight ) in giant star forming regions of the m33 and m101 galaxies , determined from the width of the integral  emission line profiles is about a few tens of @xmath5 .",
    "a close correlation was later found between the rms velocity @xmath0 , the diameter , and the total balmer line luminosity ( in the @xmath6 emission line ) of the emitting nebula @xcite .",
    "similar trends were found for individual hii regions and for dwarf irregular ( dirr ) and blue compact ( bcdg or hii ) galaxies .",
    "because of the tightness of the observed @xmath7 relation of star - bursting compact galaxies , it was proposed as an independent indicator of the cosmological distance ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "relation between the emission - line luminosity @xmath8 and ionized gas @xmath0 is also important for understanding how star formation affects motion of gas and how star formation is regulated by different stellar feedback processes .",
    "although the existence of a close correlation between these quantities has been known for a long time , the origin of luminosity  velocity dispersion relation in hii galaxies and giant hii regions remains unclear @xcite .",
    "the following factors may affect the width of the observed ionized hydrogen lines :    1 .",
    "thermal broadening , which amounts to @xmath9 for typical electron temperatures in the hii regions 700010000 k. 2 .",
    "turbulent motions determined by the combined influence of young stellar clusters on the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "3 .   gravitational broadening , caused by virial motions of gas clouds in galaxy gravitational potential .",
    "non - virial gravitational motions : ism turbulence associated with tidal interactions , galaxy merging and external gas accretion ( e.g. numerical simulations by @xcite , observational constrains in @xcite and references therein . )    when presenting and discussing the @xmath4 relation , we will always assume , except in specially mentioned cases , that @xmath8 is the total luminosity of a galaxy or a hii region in the  line , and @xmath0 is the average ( luminosity - weighed ) velocity dispersion of ionized gas .",
    "it is often assumed that the gravitational effects are the dominante factor in giant hii regions and hii galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main argument was that the velocity dispersion of ionized gas is largely determined by the wind of stars that participate in virial motions with the characteristic velocity @xmath10",
    ". then @xmath0 and @xmath10 are mainly controlled by the gravitational potential of the object , and the @xmath4 relation is similar to the faber - jackson relation for elliptical galaxies : @xmath11 .",
    "different studies of the ionized gas kinematics in giant extragalactic hii regions give a value between @xmath12 and @xmath13 for the exponent in the @xmath4 relation @xcite .",
    "@xcite present a detailed analysis of this relation for a sample of 128 local compact hii galaxies .",
    "they demonstrate that adding the second ( the size of hii regions ) or even the third ( the emission line equivalent width @xmath14 or the continuum color and metallicity ) parameters significantly improve the correlation . they also argue in favor of the gravitational origin of the ionized gas velocity dispersion @xmath0 .",
    "they also emphasize that in order the @xmath4 to be tight , the regions of recent bursts of star formation should be gravitationally bound , compact , massive , and have strong emission lines with @xmath15with pure guassian proile without any evidences of multiplicity or rotation .",
    "a different view on the @xmath4 relation was developed beginning with @xcite , who suggested that the processes related with the energy of embedded ob stars drive the ionized gas velocity dispersion in giant hii regions on scales smaller than 0.5  kpc , while properties of larger supergiant hii complexes agree with a gravitationally driven @xmath0 . based on fabry ",
    "perot interferometric observations of nearby galaxies @xcite also concluded that effects of stellar wind and turbulence are more important for the kinematics of giant hii regions compared with virial motions .",
    "there are different ways of how a young stellar population affects the surrounding ism . according @xcite ,",
    "( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) the main mechanisms are : protostellar outflows , stellar winds and ionizing radiation pressure of massive stars , supernovae ( sn ) explosions , the dust - processed infrared radiation , and warm and hot gas pressure . the contribution of different factors changes with spatial and density scale .",
    "for instance , @xcite found that warm ionized gas dominates over the other terms of pressure in all considered hii regions in large and small magellanic clouds .",
    "numerical simulations also demonstrate that the radiation pressure is a very important feedback mechanism for models of formation of galaxies compared with the hot gas contribution ( heated by sns and stellar winds ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that together with the chaotic gas motions , responsible for the gaussian emission line profile , the effects related with individual expanding shells may lead to the appearance of non - symmetric features such as wings and peaks in the line profile ( see examples in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some recent observations also provide evidence that energy injected into the interstellar medium by the ongoing star formation process is the main factor affecting gas turbulent motions .",
    "for example , @xcite show that in a wide range of galaxy luminosities the ionized gas rms velocity @xmath0 is determined by the star formation rate ( sfr ) , which is proportional to the   luminosity , and does not correlate with the galaxy mass .",
    "earlier , @xcite showed that @xmath0 for neutral gas also depends on the sfr .",
    "however other numerical simulations with higher resolution in a stratified ism suggested that this trend is absent if the gas surface density increases with the sn rate @xcite . on the other hand , the galaxy - scale simulations that included stellar feedback",
    "@xcite clearly demonstrate that the average velocity dispersion of the gas ( in all cold , warm and hot phases ) increases with the total sfr .",
    "also , @xcite argues that kinetic energy of ionized gas in the star formation regions is proportional to the local sfr , integrated over the duration of the burst .",
    "@xcite demonstrate a close correlation between the two - dimensional distribution of the radial velocity dispersion of ionized gas and the surface brightness in the  line for a sample of nearby dwarf galaxies : most of the regions with the highest velocity dispersion belong to a low - brightness diffuse background surrounding large hii-regions.recent simulations of multiple sn explosions were able to reproduce the diagrams ` intensity  velocity dispersion ' observed in these galaxies when a realistic spatial resolution was used @xcite .",
    "however , some other recent studies of high - redshift galaxies contradict @xcite .",
    "for instance , integral - field data by @xcite demonstrate a very weak correlation of @xmath0 and sfr density for star - forming clumps in galaxies at @xmath16 . further @xcite and @xcite using observations with similar technique",
    "argue that such clumps follow the same @xmath4 relation as gravitational bounded local giant hii regions according @xcite and related studies .",
    "to summarize , the question of the nature of high - velocity turbulent motions of ionized gas in dwarf galaxies still remains open .",
    "one of the problems is the lack of sufficiently uniform observational data .",
    "recent results by @xcite fill this gap to a certain extent .",
    "they give a uniform set of high - resolution spectroscopy observations for 118 star formation regions in hii galaxies .",
    "@xcite presented similar data for 128 hii galaxies selected from the sdss .",
    "they also discussed the impact of other factors ( gas metallicity , ionization state , the history of star formation ) on the @xmath4 relation .",
    "however , most of the results are based on slit spectroscopy .",
    "the distribution of ionized gas in dwarf galaxies has a complex irregular morphology , and the two - dimensional velocity dispersion maps , obtained using the 3d spectroscopy can provide the most complete information about gas turbulence .",
    "the second important issue is related with the fact that the luminosity - weighted velocity dispersion has become a widely used value to characterize the turbulent gas motions in samples of distant and nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "how does the @xmath4 relation work for galaxies of different types and luminosities ? do galaxies obey the same scaling relation as the hii regions and star forming clumps ?",
    "in this paper we analyse ionized gas turbulent motions in 59 galaxies observed at the 6-m big telescope alt - azimuthal ( bta ) of special astrophysical observatory of the russian academy of sciences ( sao ras ) using a scanning fabry  perot interferometer ( fpi ) .",
    "most of our sample consists of dwarf galaxies of the local universe . using this unique material",
    ", we were able to extend the @xmath4 relation for objects much weaker than in the samples described earlier .",
    "our sample is based on the archive data of observations at the 6-m telescope of sao ras .",
    "it consists of several subsamples of galaxies studied within the framework of several observational programs :    * the local volume ( lv ) subsample : 36 nearby dwarf galaxies with galactocentric distances @xmath17 mpc .",
    "these are mostly low - luminosity objects with the average absolute magnitude @xmath18 .",
    "the ionized gas velocity dispersion maps of 10 galaxies from this subsample were already reported by @xcite . * the xmd subsample of 9 more distant ( @xmath19 mpc ) and bright ( @xmath20 ) dwarf galaxies with extremely low metallicity , and 2 low surface brightness companion galaxies . their internal kinematics were described and analysed in @xcite . * the bcdg subsample : 12 blue compact dwarf galaxies at distances @xmath21 mpc ; all are brighter than @xmath22 .",
    "some of them ( e.g. , mrk 297 or iii  zw  102 ) are sometimes included in bcdg samples ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though they can not be formally called dwarf galaxies since their absolute magnitude is brighter than @xmath23 and the amplitude of the rotation curve exceeds @xmath24 .",
    "the observational data for 3 of these galaxies were presented by @xcite .",
    "the full sample consists of 59 galaxies , and covers a wide range of luminosities from @xmath25 to @xmath26 . the overwhelming majority ( 51/59=86 per cents ) of them are dwarf galaxies with the absolute magnitudes @xmath27 .",

    "we shall not show separately subsamples nor depict the error bars .",
    "the upper right panel shows the distribution of @xmath155 in a more traditional form , on a logarithmic scale along both axes .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the dependence between the logarithms of luminosity and dispersion is almost exactly linear with a rather small scatter .",
    "this fact was noted in many studies , but , as already mentioned in the introduction , in the case of giant hii regions it was usually associated with the virial ratio , i.e. by the fact that the ionized gas velocity dispersion is definitely related with stellar velocity dispersion and is controlled by the total mass of the system .",
    "however , the luminosity in the balmer emission lines is not a unique function of mass , while it is determined by the number of young ob - stars ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "while for any reasonable initial stellar mass function , the total stellar mass is determined by the more numerous but less massive stars that can not ionize the surrounding gas . also the mass of the dark matter correlates exactly with this stellar mass through the tully - fisher relation .",
    "if @xmath0 is defined by the mass of the system , it should better correlate not with @xmath149 , but with the luminosity in broader spectral bands , or other parameters that are directly related to the mass .",
    "but this is not observed .",
    "figure  [ fig_lum1 ] shows the @xmath4 dependence , built for @xmath77 . in the optical @xmath143-band",
    "the older stellar population has a larger contribution , compared to the luminosity .",
    "however , the point spread here is larger , and the correlation coefficient is smaller : @xmath158 versus @xmath159 in the case of of @xmath149 .",
    "the @xmath160-band luminosity is directly related with the total mass of stellar population of the galaxy , moreover , the effect of interstellar reddening is much smaller here .",
    "however , the point spread on the @xmath161 diagram is same with @xmath77 ( @xmath162 , figure  [ fig_lum1 ] bottom right ) .",
    "we also use a parameter related to the dynamical mass of the system  the amplitude of the rotation velocity , @xmath153 .",
    "left panel in figure  [ fig_lum2 ] indicates that ionized gas velocity dispersion does not depend on the amplitude of the rotation velocity @xmath153 with the correlation coefficient being very low ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "for galaxies with @xmath164 the gas velocity dispersion is remarkably large . on average @xmath165 with substantial galaxy - to - galaxy variations .",
    "@xcite came to a similar conclusion that @xmath0 is not related to the total stellar mass for more distant galaxies with violent star formation .",
    "another argument against a direct relation of @xmath0 with the galaxy mass is that there should be observed a systematic departure from the general trend for the galaxies in the transient unrelaxed state , such as merger and interacting .",
    "we also attribute to clear mergers such systems as mrk  297 ( two clearly kinematically decoupled components ) ; ugc  993 , hs  2236 + 1344 and sbs  1116 + 517 , where two rotating discs can be identified in the velocity fields @xcite , and a tight pair ugc  7648/7651 ( ngc  4485/4490 ) distorted by interaction . as ` possible interaction ' galaxies we classify ugc  772 , ugc  3672 ,",

    "* ) and the galaxies with kinematically decoupled polar components : mrk  33 , mrk  370 @xcite and iiizw102 @xcite .",
    "however , in figure  [ fig_lum2 ] all these galaxies follow a general relationship , just like isolated galaxy ugc  7611 ( ngc  4460 ) , where the ionized gas is associated with the circumnuclear star burst and galactic wind outflow @xcite .",
    "discussed above features of the @xmath4 and @xmath166 correlations suggest that the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath149 ( i.e. the current sfr ) is primary . in this case the correlations of velocity dispersion with @xmath77 , @xmath167 , with the stellar and total mass are secondary , being the consequences of other scaling relations in the galaxies .",
    "indeed , the more massive and bright galaxies with ongoing star formation as a rule tend to have a greater luminosity in the balmer lines as well .",
    "@xcite used an analytical model to support the idea that @xmath0 of ionized gas , observed in giant star - forming regions and hii - galaxies is determined by the mass of these objects .",
    "the authors conclude that @xmath0 in the regions of greatest brightness ( `` the kinematic cores of hii - regions '' ) is directly related to the mass and size of the star forming region . at the same time , bright hii - regions surrounded by the low - brightness coronae of ionized gas with a larger velocity dispersion .",
    "such structure occurs as a result of the influence of young stellar groups on the ism .",
    "but if the velocity dispersion in the centres of star - forming regions determined by the virial motions , then this value ",
    "@xmath168 should be better correlated with the parameters related with mass ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) , rather than with @xmath149 , which is controlled by the number of ionizing photons from young massive stars . on the other hand ,",
    "the average velocity dispersion of diffuse environment should show a clearer ( than on the average for the entire galaxy ) relation with @xmath149 , since not only the number of lyman quanta , but also the kinetic energy output of the winds of young stars and supernovae is directly scaled with total number of ob stars ( see figure  1 in * ? ? ? * ) . while the gas velocity dispersion is proportional to the square root of the kinetic energy of turbulent motions .",
    "we separate the velocity dispersion maps into cores of hii regions and a diffuse component . for that we use a histogram of the brightness distribution in the emission line for each galaxy .",
    "we consider as belonging to `` cores '' all the pixels , which contain the top 20 per cents of the total luminosity , while the same 20 percent of the luminosity in the low flux pixels are assigned to the diffuse component .",
    "typical examples of galaxy map separation into two components are shown in figure  [ fig_diff ] that also presents the corresponding histograms of intensity of the surface brightness in , explaining the method of separation ( the bright and faint tail of the distribution of surface brightness ) .",
    "we can see that `` cores '' really correspond to the very centres of bright hii regions , while pixels marked as `` diffuse '' correspond to the envelopes surrounding the regions of star formation .    for each of the components we calculate the flux - weighted velocity dispersion .",
    "figure  [ fig_lum3 ] shows the corresponding relations .",
    "it is clear that the gas velocity dispersion of the cores @xmath168 and of the diffuse component @xmath169 are very similar .",
    "this is also confirmed by the correlation coefficients with respective luminosities that are almost the same , or even lower than those for the @xmath0 of the entire disc .",
    "therefore , the separation into the central and diffuse components shows that the velocity dispersion at the centres of hii regions , as well as the diffuse component are primarily determined by luminosity , i.e. by the number of young massive stars .",
    "we have performed this analysis for various `` core / diffuse '' separation criteria .",
    "the general conclusion is the same as for the 20 percent criterion described here .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the @xmath4 relation has been extensively studied , mainly for intergalactic and extragalactic hii regions and compact hii galaxies .",
    "all the results agree that there is a power - law relation : @xmath170 .",
    "however , the exponent @xmath28 measured in different studies considerably varies from @xmath171 @xcite to 6.6 @xcite . for discussion",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite obtained @xmath172 using a large sample of compact hii galaxies restricted by velocity dispersion ( @xmath173 ) and equivalent width ( @xmath174 in order to minimize the contribution of rotation - supported system and/or objects with a complex emission lines structure .",
    "@xcite suggested @xmath175 which provides a common fit to the both local hii regions and starforming clumps in high - redshift galaxies .",
    "it is possible that different flux limits used in observations to measure @xmath0 for different types of objects ( e.g. , individual hii regions , dwarf emission galaxies , objects at large redshift ) make some contribution to the uncertainty with @xmath28 .",
    "potential biases of selecting bright @xmath176 regions in the long - slit spectroscopy as compared with the full 3d spectroscopy may also contribute to the disagreements .",
    "indeed , figure  [ fig_lum3 ] shows that the velocity width @xmath168 in regions with high @xmath176 fluxes is systematically smaller than @xmath169 in regions with low fluxes . if one uses the spectra that are not deep enough , the measured mean velocity dispersion will be underestimated .",
    "another possible reason for the disagreement is that the slope of the @xmath177 relation changes with the luminosity and with the age of the most recent burst of star formation episode .",
    "figure  [ fig_lum4 ] combines our measurements with results by other authors who used similar techniques to estimate the ionized gas @xmath0 , i.e. 3d - spectroscopic observations ( integral - field or scanning fpi ) and calculation of the flux - weighted velocity dispersion for the whole galaxy instead individual hii regions : 9 blue compact galaxies from @xcite , 11 starburst galaxies selected from the sdss for @xmath178 @xcite , 65 star - forming disc galaxies at @xmath179 @xcite and 57 local luminous and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( u / lirgss ) without evidences of active galactic nucleus @xcite . the published data on high - redshift systems were not included because the beam smearing of the velocity gradient can produce a bias in the estimate of the velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "the figure shows , that for a wide range of luminosities @xmath180 , there is a tight correlation between @xmath149 and @xmath0 .",
    "using the least square fit we derive the slope @xmath181 for the present @xmath4 relation is considered as an independent variable in agreement with previous studies as it discussed in @xcite .",
    "the plots show that there is a sort of kink at @xmath182 , corresponding to @xmath183 . ]",
    "this is why a linear approximation of the @xmath184 relation yields substantially different slopes for large and small luminosities .",
    "another way of presenting our results is to relate @xmath149 luminosity to the star formation rate sfr .",
    "it is known that the @xmath149 luminosity is almost exactly proportional to the rate of ongoing star formation ( sfr ) of young massive stars @xcite . however",
    ", a comparison of sfrs estimated separately from @xmath176 data and _ galex _ far - ultraviolet observations shows that for the low luminosities this ratio is broken due to the relative scarcity of massive stars in dwarf galaxies , in relation with their initial mass function .",
    "@xcite show that sfr@xmath185 for @xmath186 .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig_lum4 ] presents the sfr-@xmath0 relation when we use @xcite conversion equations .",
    "the full range of the sfr in considered objects is @xmath1 . for the u",
    "/ lirgss sample we accepted @xmath187 calculated from the near - infrared ( ir ) luminosity using an equation from @xcite , because a large uncertainties with reddening correction of @xmath149 in these `` dusty '' systems @xcite .",
    "indeed , the resulting scatter of points corresponded to the high @xmath0 for the @xmath187 seems to be smaller than for the @xmath176 luminosities .",
    "note that the combination of the above factors ( non - linearity of @xmath188 relation for the faint dwarf galaxies , and ir - based @xmath187 for the most luminous ulirgs ) leads a linear relation fitted as @xmath189 .",
    "using their data for the u / lirgss sample , @xcite fitted the similar relation as @xmath190 that corresponds to the slope @xmath191 .",
    "this value is significantly larger than our measurements derived for the full sample included both faint and ultra - luminous galaxies .",
    "@xcite suggested that relatively weak dependency of @xmath0 on the total @xmath187 , inferred from their fit , is related with the fact that star formation is not a dominant source driving the ionized gas velocity dispersion .",
    "instead , they present arguments in support the scenario where gravitational energy associated with interaction and mergers has a significant contribution to the gas turbulence for the @xmath192 .",
    "however , our results clearly demonstrate the same tendency @xmath193 for the dwarf galaxies with and without interaction as well as for u / lirgs , which appear to have a larger fraction of ongoing mergers .",
    "this fact may indicate that the role of interactions in driving ionized gas turbulence in u / lirgs was overestimated .",
    "the other intriguing fact is that the slope of the @xmath4 relation inferred from our analysis ( @xmath194 ) is near the value @xmath195 obtained by @xcite . from the one hand ,",
    "@xcite considered individual giant hii regions and avoided rotation - support system . from the other hand , the most of galaxies presented on figure  [ fig_lum4 ] reveal a domination of circular rotation discs in their kinematics . in previous sections we presented arguments that the ongoing star formation is a dominant driver of @xmath0 calculated for the whole galactic disc .",
    "why are the galaxies of very different types and luminosities follow a similar @xmath4 relation with the systems where `` the main mechanism of line broadening is linked to the gravitational potential of the young massive cluster '' @xcite ?",
    "note that the range of luminosities on the relation shown on the fig .",
    "[ fig_lum4 ] is twice larger as compared with @xmath4 considered in previous works for compact hii galaxies .",
    "@xcite convincingly show that in a wide range of galaxy luminosities , including the objects at @xmath196 , the mean velocity dispersion @xmath0 is determined only by the star formation rate ( i.e. by the luminosity ) and does not correlate with mass . in this case ,",
    "@xmath0 is characteristic of the energy injected in the ism by stellar winds , supernova explosions , and stellar radiation . for the velocity dispersion of neutral gas , a similar conclusion  weak correlation with galaxy mass ",
    "was previously drawn by @xcite .",
    "further , the analysis of the shape of integrated hi profiles by @xcite shows that the velocity dispersion of a broad component of the hi line in dwarf galaxies is defined by the sfr@xmath197 ratio , although the dependence on the galaxy mass is also present .",
    "previously we found that there is a close relationship between the two - dimensional distributions of the line - of - sight velocity dispersions of the ionized gas and the local luminosity @xcite .",
    "specifically , we found that most of the areas with the highest velocity dispersion belong to the diffuse low brightness gas , surrounding the star forming regions .",
    "this contadicts the idea that @xmath0 is determined mainly by the distribution of mass in the of galaxy . in this case one",
    "would have expected a different pattern  the maximum of velocity dispersion at the centres of star - forming regions and a decreasing @xmath198 with the distance from the centre .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss different types of correlations of @xmath0 with integral parameters of galaxies  the amplitude of the rotation curve , and luminosities in different bands .",
    "we find that the relationship with the parameters characterizing the mass of the galaxy is considerably less distinct than the one with the ongoing star formation , determined by the luminosity .",
    "moreover , the current sfr determines the magnitude of supersonic turbulent motions of gas not only in the starburst galaxies , but also in objects with a very low sfr up to @xmath199 .",
    "we analyse two - dimensional velocity fields of ionized gas using observations at the 6-m bta telescope .",
    "this allows us to confidently measure the mean @xmath0 across a galaxy , and study details of its distribution inside and outside of star - forming regions .",
    "our new data significantly extend the published @xmath4 relations to the low mass galaxies and provide the observational evidence that the star formation determines the velocity dispersion of the ionized gas :    * the ionized gas velocity dispersion , luminosity - averaged across the galaxy , is better correlated with the luminosity in the line than in the broad @xmath143 and @xmath160-bands .",
    "there is almost no correlation of the velocity dispersion@xmath0 with the rotation velocity of galaxy . *",
    "the gas velocity dispersion @xmath0 in the cores of star - forming regions is nearly the same as @xmath0 in the duffuse component with low fluxes .",
    "* there a common @xmath193 relation for the local galaxies in a very broad range of luminosities @xmath200 that corresponds @xmath201 .",
    "the fit of this relation @xmath202 provides the slope @xmath203 .",
    "we therefore conclude that velocity of turbulent motions of ionized gas in galaxies is defined mainly by the energy that is transferred to the interstellar medium from young stellar populations in the form of ionizing radiation pressure , and by the winds of young stars and supernova explosions .",
    "we believe that this conclusion is important for both simulations of galaxy formation and for interpretation of the apparent emission line widths in galaxies affected by various processes ( e.g. , star formation , merging , and virial motions ) .",
