    "<S> we report on a voltage tunable radio - frequency ( rf ) detector based on a magnetic tunnel junction ( mtj ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - torque diode effect is used to excite and/or detect rf oscillations in the magnetic free layer of the mtj . in order to reduce the overall in - plane magnetic anisotropy of the free layer , we take advantage of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy at the interface between ferromagnetic and insulating layers . the applied bias voltage is shown to have a significant influence on the magnetic anisotropy , and thus on the resonance frequency of the device . </S>",
    "<S> this influence also depends on the voltage polarity . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results are accounted for in terms of the interplay of spin - transfer - torque and voltage - controlled magnetic anisotropy effects .    </S>",
    "<S> due to spin wave excitations , magnetic thin films can emit and/or absorb electromagnetic signals in a microwave frequency range determined by ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) . in turn , radio - frequency ( rf ) signals can be produced in magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) _ via _ the spin - transfer - torque ( stt ) effect @xcite , where a spin polarized current excites magnetization precession with a frequency that depends , among others , on the magnetic anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> this precession gives rise to an electric signal that can be used in various devices , like spin wave generators @xcite or spin - torque oscillators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the inverse effect , i.e. , absorption of rf spin currents by a mtj produces a detectable dc signal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon , called the spin - torque diode effect , can be used as an rf - detector of very high sensitivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been shown that similar behavior can be achieved with alternating - voltage - controlled magnetic anisotropy ( vcma ) @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose a voltage tunable spin - torque diode , that is capable of sensing rf signals of different frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> we achieved such a functionality by using a combination of the stt and vcma effects . </S>",
    "<S> the former effect produces the dc voltage in response to ac current , while the latter one changes the resonance detection regime . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , using a specially designed mtj , we are able to measure stt components in a voltage range of @xmath0 v , which to our knowledge is beyond the stt measurements published to date ( up to @xmath1 v in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) and reveals a non - linear behavior of the in - plane stt component vs. bias voltage @xcite .    to achieve the above objective , we have investigated mtjs with the following multilayer structure : sio@xmath2 ( substrate ) / 5 ta / 30 cun / 3 ta / 30 cun / 3 ta / 16 pt@xmath3mn@xmath4 / 2.1 co@xmath5fe@xmath6 / 0.9 ru / 2.3 co@xmath7fe@xmath7b@xmath8 / 1.6 mgo / 1 - 2 co@xmath7fe@xmath7b@xmath8 / 10 ta / 7 ru ( thickness in nm ) . by varying thickness of the cofeb free layer ( fl ) </S>",
    "<S> , we observed a transition from in - plane to perpendicular anisotropy at a critical thickness of @xmath9 nm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after deposition , the mtjs were annealed at 250 @xmath10c in an in - plane magnetic field of 0.4 t in order to set the exchange bias direction and to improve the crystallization of the ferromagnetic electrodes . for the transport measurements we used the mtj with 1.6 nm thick fl , that reveals weak in - plane anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> after patterning to the elliptical - shape pillars with the cross - section dimensions of 530 @xmath11 280 nm , using electron beam lithography , ion - beam etching and lift - off process , the tmr ratio of about 100 % ( measured at low bias voltage ) and the resistance area ( ra ) product of 2 k@xmath12m@xmath13 were achieved . </S>",
    "<S> all mtj nanopillars were measured at room temperature in the in - plane and perpendicular magnetic field , and with a bias voltage applied with respect to the fl ( top layer ) . </S>",
    "<S> high frequency measurements were performed using rf probes connected to the bias - t . </S>",
    "<S> the overlap between the bottom and top mtj contact is 4 @xmath14m@xmath13 , which results in the mtj capacitance of 4@xmath1110@xmath15 f. the mtj geometry and the nanopillar scanning electron microscope image are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : geometry ] .        due to a high resistance of the mtj of @xmath16 = 16 k@xmath17 in the parallel magnetic state , </S>",
    "<S> the bandwidth @xmath18 = 1/(2@xmath19 @xmath20 ) is limited to around 2.5 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , due to a resistance mismatch between our 50-ohm measurement system , the rf reflection coefficient is @xmath21 = ( @xmath22 - 50)/(@xmath22 + 50 ) = 0.995 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , setting the power of the rf generator to 100 @xmath14w ( -10 dbm ) , only 1% ( 1-@xmath23 ) , i.e. , 1 @xmath14w is applied to the mtj , which results in i@xmath24 = 7.3 @xmath14a rf current and j@xmath24 = 5.9@xmath1110@xmath25 a / m@xmath13 current density . </S>",
    "<S> we note that such current densities are sufficient to excite the magnetization dynamics by means of stt effect @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : tmr ] presents resistance vs. in - plane and perpendicular magnetic field curves , measured for different bias voltage polarity . </S>",
    "<S> there is an evident influence of the bias voltage on the curves for perpendicular magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> then , we performed spin - diode measurements on our mtjs . by applying perpendicular magnetic field , clear fmr spectra </S>",
    "<S> are observed , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : stfmr ] , similar to those observed earlier in ref . @xcite .            </S>",
    "<S> in order to model the dependence of the resonance frequency vs. perpendicular magnetic field we used a micromagnetic simulations using object oriented micromagnetic framework ( oommf ) @xcite . in the calculations we have included all ferromagnetic layers with ru and mgo spacers . </S>",
    "<S> the whole five layer system was modeled using similar approach as in our previous work @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cell size was set to 4 @xmath11 4 @xmath11 2 nm and the nanopillar cross - section was the same as in experiment . </S>",
    "<S> interlayer exchange coupling between the fl and reference layer ( rl ) through the mgo barrier was set to zero , leaving only coupling due to a demagnetization field . </S>",
    "<S> perpendicular anisotropy of the fl was equal to 870 kj / m@xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the in - plane anisotropy was mainly determined by the shape anisotropy . however , in order to achieve a better agreement with the experiment , an additional magnetocrystalline in - plane anisotropy of 8 kj / m@xmath26 was assumed .    </S>",
    "<S> due to an interplay between the in - plane shape anisotropy and strong perpendicular anisotropy at the cofeb / mgo interface , the resulting magnetization of the fl at zero external magnetic field is inhomogeneous as presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : oommf_map]a . for a perpendicular field of @xmath27 = 1000 oe , </S>",
    "<S> the fl is evenly magnetized in a perpendicular direction , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : oommf_map]b . </S>",
    "<S> the fmr spectra were simulated using similar approach as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> examples of oommf results obtained for perpendicular field of @xmath27 = 0 and 1000 oe are depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : oommf_map]c - d . </S>",
    "<S> note a nonuniform fmr spectrum for the inhomogenously magnetized fl ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : oommf_map]c ) . the simulated resonant frequency for 1000 </S>",
    "<S> oe field was close to the experimental one , [ fig : oommf_map]d . in order to achieve the frequency shift as measured with the bias voltage of 1 v , the perpendicular anisotropy constant had to be changed by 4 kj / m@xmath26 .        from the tmr vs. magnetic field behavior </S>",
    "<S> we are able to calculate the angle @xmath28 between magnetizations of the fl and rl . </S>",
    "<S> we note , that for the field of @xmath27 = 600 oe , the angle @xmath28 @xmath29 90 @xmath30 , which results in maximum stt signal and minimum vcma rf signal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we attribute the obtained mixing voltage signal to the stt - based phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our signal exhibits pure lorentzian shape , unlike dispersive signal in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which further supports the stt origin of the mixing voltage . </S>",
    "<S> next , we performed similar measurements for the magnetic field of @xmath27 = 600 oe , but for different dc bias voltage in the range of -1 @xmath31 v @xmath31 1 v. the obtained results are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : std ] . </S>",
    "<S> the st - fmr signal inverses at around 0.3 v from positive to negative amplitude . using the model presented in @xcite , we have analyzed the obtained st - fmr curves as a function of the bias voltage in order to derive the stt - components .     </S>",
    "<S> = 600 oe in the bias voltage range from -1 @xmath31 v@xmath32 @xmath311 v. the black solid line is a guide for the eye , and represents a change in the frequency of -97 mhz / v . ]    clearly , for all bias voltage values , the signal is of lorentzian - shape . </S>",
    "<S> this results in the in - plane torque of two orders of magnitude larger than the out - of - plane torque @xcite , contrary to the results measured typically in mtjs with thin ( below 1 nm ) mgo tunnel barriers . based on this analysis , the in - plane torque in our </S>",
    "<S> mtjs exhibits parabolic - like shape in a larger voltage range , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : stt ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results were compared with theoretical ones based on the free - electron model @xcite . as the first step </S>",
    "<S> we fitted the calculated current - voltage curves to the measured ones and we obtained a good qualitative agreement ( not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> here , we used the band structure parameters corresponding to co- and fe - based electrodes : fermi level ( the width of the majority spins band ) @xmath33 = 1.1 ev and spin splitting energy @xmath34__e _ _ = 1.3 ev . </S>",
    "<S> such a structure corresponds to entirely polarized conduction band ( @xmath35 ) at zero bias voltage in accordance with the first principle calculations for co(fe)/mgo structures @xcite . in turn </S>",
    "<S> , the barrier was described by the potential @xmath36 = 1.3 ev ( above the fermi level ) and the thickness of 1.6 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the height of the barrier was chosen arbitrary because of its great sensitivity to the interface structure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this value seems to be reasonable and close to that measured experimentally for similar structures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we introduced the effective electron mass @xmath37 within the barrier , which is different from the electron effective mass in the electrodes , m@xmath38 = m@xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> an extension of the model introduced in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite requires an additional application of bendaniel - duke boundary conditions for wave functions and their first derivatives @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of light carriers in the mgo layer reflects the fact that tunneling electrons ( evanescent bloch states ) have different decay lengths within this kind of barrier , which depend on their symmetry @xcite . as a result , we obtained a nonlinear torque dependence at higher bias voltage ( @xmath40v@xmath40 @xmath41 0.4 v ) , which agrees with the experimental curve . </S>",
    "<S> contrary , for voltages @xmath40v@xmath40 @xmath31 0.4 v , the experimental data as well as the theoretical ones exhibit linear dependence on the voltage . </S>",
    "<S> similar behavior was observed for mtjs with thinner tunnel barriers , which however could not be probed at higher voltages . in order to exclude second and third order effects predicted in @xcite , we repeated st - fmr measurements for a different magnetic field resulting in theta close to 90 degrees , and we found the same behavior . </S>",
    "<S> thus we could exclude non - linear second order fmr effects on our signal . </S>",
    "<S> the same experiment was performed on a few different mtjs of the same wafer , exhibiting similar results .        </S>",
    "<S> the stt - model , however , can not account for the frequency peak shift with bias voltage . </S>",
    "<S> such shift is measured in thin mgo mtjs as a result of perpendicular torque , which also changes the peak shape from a lorentzian- to a dispersive - like curve @xcite . because we do not see any contribution form the perpendicular torque in a thick mgo mtj , we can account the frequency shift with the bias voltage polarity to vcma , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : std ] . using the micromagnetic model presented above </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the change in the resonance frequency of -97mhz / v corresponds to the change in the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of 4 kj / m@xmath26/v . </S>",
    "<S> such anisotropy changes are smaller than the values reported before @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it was shown recently that both the direction and the magnitude of vcma can depend strongly on the interface quality as well as on the adjacent layer @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the measured effects and their interpretation based on the combination of stt and vcma , we can design an rf detector that can be tuned in a certain frequency range . </S>",
    "<S> changing the bias voltage polarity we can modify the peak - detection frequency from 1.6 to 1.4 ghz , i.e. in the range that could be interesting for wireless communication . </S>",
    "<S> the quality factor , though still low , can be improved using point - contact or vortex structures where the peak is typically of much smaller width @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by increasing the device area , one can reduce the mtj resistance , and thus , reduce the impedance mismatch and improve the sensitivity from the measured level of 11 to 1000 w / v .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated the spin - torque diode rf detector based on a mtj with 1.6 nm mgo barrier . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained fmr spectra have been accounted in terms of the stt effects . in turn </S>",
    "<S> , the difference in the fmr frequencies at different bias voltages has been attributed to vcma . </S>",
    "<S> based on our results we have also determined a non - linear in - plane torque vs. bias voltage in a wide voltage range . </S>"
