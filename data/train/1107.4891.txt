    "full jet reconstruction is considered as a promising tool for the quantitative study of properties of the hot and dense medium produced in heavy - ion collisions at rhic energy .",
    "the complexity of heavy - ion collisions , where modifications of the fragmentation functions due to interaction of partons with the hot and dense medium are expected , requires inevitably a detailed understanding of jet production in p+p and d+au collisions .",
    "therefore measurements in these collision systems can be used as a baseline to disentangle initial state nuclear effects from cold nuclear matter effects , medium - induced @xmath0 broadening and jet quenching .",
    "in addition , it is also important to understand how the beam - beam remnants , multiple parton interactions and initial- and final - state radiation combine to produce particles in the underlying event ( ue ) .",
    "the extracted underlying event properties serve as in important input for tuning of the qcd monte - carlo models such as pythia .",
    "the first results on inclusive jet spectra in p+p collisions at @xmath2  =  200 gev measured by the star experiment at rhic in 2003 - 2004 were published in  @xcite .",
    "the measured inclusive jet cross - section is in a very good agreement with nlo pqcd calculations over seven orders of magnitude . during the data taking in 2006 and 2008 , the star experiment collected large data samples of p+p and d+au collisions at @xmath1  =  200 gev . in this paper , the study of p+p collisions is extended by investigating fragmentation functions of charged and strange particles ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) as well as underlying event properties .",
    "further , the paper discusses recent preliminary results on inclusive jet spectra and di - jet correlations in d+au collisions .",
    "the preliminary results presented in this paper are based on analysis of p+p collisions at @xmath2  = 200  gev measured in 2006 and p+p and d+au collisions at @xmath1  = 200  gev recorded in 2008 by the star experiment . to increase yield of hard processes , two special triggers utilizing information from barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) were used in addition to minimum bias trigger . in 2006 ,",
    "a `` jet - patch '' trigger defined as a @xmath6  =  1@xmath71 patch of bemc containing transverse energy @xmath8  8  gev was used . in 2008 , an online bemc high tower ( ht ) trigger was used . to satisfy the ht trigger condition ,",
    "at least one tower of bemc must contain @xmath9 above a predefined threshold , which in case of the data presented here was 4.3  gev .",
    "in d+au collisions , the beam beam counter detector , located in the fragmentation region of au nucleus , was used to select the 20% highest multiplicity events .",
    "jets were reconstructed using sequential recombination algorithms @xmath10 and anti-@xmath10 as well as seedless infrared safe cone algorithm siscone , which are implemented in the fastjet package  @xcite .",
    "for the measurement of the neutral component of jets bemc was used .",
    "the charged component of jets was measured by the time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "both tpc and bemc have a full azimuthal coverage and their combined pseudorapidity acceptance is @xmath11  0.95 .",
    "this limits the fiducial acceptance of jets in pseudorapidity to 1-@xmath12 , where @xmath12 is the resolution parameter used in jet reconstruction . to avoid double counting of energy ( electrons , minimum ionizing particles and possible hadronic showers in bemc ) ,",
    "the so called 100% hadronic correction was applied : the momentum of a charged particle from tpc was subtracted off the neutral tower energy in bemc , if the measured charged particle track pointed to a bemc tower . in order to minimize biases due to dead areas and possible background in bemc ,",
    "the neutral energy fraction ( nef ) of the total jet energy was required to be within 0.1  @xmath13  nef  @xmath13  0.9 . for charged particle tracks , an upper transverse momentum cut - off @xmath14  15",
    "gev/@xmath15 was applied due to uncertainty in tpc tracking performance at large transverse momentum .",
    "detailed investigation of this limitation is in progress .    in parallel to experimental data analysis , the analysis of jets and underlying event properties was also performed on simulated data .",
    "the simulations are based on pythia 6.410 , tuned to the cdf data at @xmath2  = 1.96  tev ( tune a ) and combined with a full star detector simulation based on geant .",
    "the simulated data were then analyzed using the same analysis chain as that for the measured data .",
    "we distinguish several levels of the simulated data : jet reconstruction at monte carlo particle level ( pymc ) and at detector level including geant simulation ( pyge ) .",
    "in addition , to determine influence of background and its fluctuations on jet production in d+au collisions , pythia events were embedded in 0 - 20% highest multiplicity minimum bias d+au events .",
    "this procedure was performed at detector level using reconstructed tpc tracks and signal in bemc towers .",
    "this level of simulation is labeled as `` pybg '' .",
    "figure  [ ff_charged_particles_r04 ] shows the uncorrected fragmentation functions of charged particles for jets with transverse momentum 20  @xmath16  30  gev/@xmath15 measured in p+p collisions at @xmath2  =  200  gev using the jet - patch triggered data  @xcite .",
    "as this trigger creates a neutral energy fragmentation bias for the triggered jet , the fragmentation functions are shown only for the di - jet partner on away side .",
    "the fragmentation functions are plotted as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "the jets were reconstructed by three different jet algorithms ( k@xmath18 , anti-@xmath19 and siscone ) with a resolution parameter @xmath12  =  0.4 and @xmath12  =  0.7 , respectively .",
    "all charged tracks measured by tpc and neutral towers from bemc with @xmath20  0.2  gev/@xmath15 were included in jet reconstruction .",
    "no significant dependence on jet algorithm is observed .",
    "the measured fragmentation functions are compared to pythia simulations described above . for both resolution parameters",
    "studied there is a good agreement between the data and simulation .",
    "this suggests that the nlo contributions which are not included in pythia are small at rhic .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     figure  [ ue_nch_meanpt ] shows the uncorrected charged particle density and mean transverse momentum in transmin , transmax and away side jet regions as a function of leading jet @xmath21 in the di - jet sample .",
    "jets were reconstructed with the @xmath10 algorithm with the resolution parameter @xmath12  =  0.7  @xcite .",
    "no significant dependence on jet algorithm was observed . the charged particle density as well as @xmath22 are approximately independent of leading jet @xmath21 , while the away - side jet charged particle density and @xmath22 are rising with jet @xmath21 , as expected .",
    "compared to data measured at tevatron ( @xmath2  =  1.96  tev ) , the values of chaged particle density and @xmath22 in the underlying event at rhic energy are in general lower .    the measured data in figure  [ ue_nch_meanpt ] are compared to pythia simulation ( tune a ) with mpi scaling factor @xmath23  =  0.25 based on recent measurements at tevatron energies ( @xmath2  =  630 , 1800 and 1960 gev )  @xcite .",
    "pythia describes the main features of the data well , however a closer investigation reveals that pythia slightly underestimates the charged particle multiplicity and @xmath22 in transmax and transmin regions while overestimating these quantities within the jet .    in figure  [ ue_nch_zoom_poisson ]",
    "the measured charged particle density in ue is investigated closer by comparing the results for the transverse regions between the leading and di - jet samples  @xcite .",
    "no significant difference between the jet samples is observed at rhic energy which points to the fact that the hard scattered partons do not emit significant amount of large angle isr and fsr .",
    "this observation is very different to that at tevatron , where in @xmath24 collisions at @xmath2  =  1.96  tev the ratio of charged particle density in leading / di - jet samples was found to be about 0.65  @xcite .",
    "the data in figure  [ ue_nch_zoom_poisson ] are compared with an expected charged particle density in case the multiplicity in the ue would follow a simple poisson distribution with an average value of 0.36 .",
    "this simple simulation suggests that at rhic energy , the splitting of the transmax and transmin values is mostly due to the sampling of the total charged particle multiplicity measured .     using siscone algorithm with a resolution parameter @xmath12  =  0.7 shown separately for a leading jet and back - to - back jet samples .",
    "the data and simulation are presented at detector level .",
    "the solid line indicate expected charged particle density in case of simple poisson distribution of charged particles in ue.,height=226 ]",
    "in summary , various properties of jets in p+p and d+au collisions at @xmath1  =  200  gev were discussed and compared to pythia simulations .",
    "the measured fragmentation functions of charged particles and identified strange particles at detector level show a good agreement with pythia simulations for charged and @xmath3 particles , while for @xmath4 and @xmath5 pythia fails to describe details of the fragmentation pattern .",
    "the measured inclusive jet @xmath21 spectra and nuclear @xmath0 broadening in d+au collisions from 2008 do not show any significant cold nuclear matter effects when compared to the measurements in @xmath25 collisions within current statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "these uncertainties will be further decreased by comparing the data to a new jet cross section measurement in p+p collisions from 2008 and improvements in the tracking efficiency determination from jet embedding in real d+au data .",
    "first studies of underlying event properties in p+p collisions show that its charged particle density and mean @xmath21 are largely independent of jet transverse momentum and the contributions from initial and final state radiation are small .",
    "studies of ue in d+au collisions are underway and are expected to bring further insights into details of particle production mechanism in cold nuclear matter .",
