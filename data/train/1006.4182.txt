    "in this paper we study the relation between the topology of a complete riemannian surface @xmath0 and the minimum number of _ vertices _ , i.e. , critical points of geodesic curvature , of closed curves in @xmath0 .",
    "our prime motivation here is the classical theorem of kneser , which states that any @xmath1 simple closed curve in euclidean plane @xmath2 has at least four vertices .",
    "it is known that this result also holds in the sphere @xmath3 and hyperbolic plane @xmath4 , since the stereographic projection and the inclusion map of the poincar disk preserve vertices .",
    "further , it follows from another classical result due to mbius @xcite that any simple closed curve in the projective plane @xmath5 has at least three vertices .",
    "we show that , up to a rescaling , these are the only surfaces where every simple closed curve has more than two vertices :    [ thm:1 ] the only complete riemannian surfaces where every simple closed curve has more than two vertices are the space forms with finite fundamental group .    thus the simply connected space forms are the only complete riemannian surfaces where kneser s four vertex theorem holds , and real projective planes are the only other surfaces where every simple closed curve has at least three vertices .",
    "another classification result we obtain in this work uses the extension of kneser s theorem to self - intersecting curves by pinkall @xcite who showed that every closed curve in @xmath2 ( and hence @xmath4 and @xmath3 ) which bounds a compact immersed region must have at least four vertices .",
    "our next theorem shows that this property also characterizes the simply connected space forms :    [ thm:2 ] the only complete riemannian surfaces where every closed curve which bounds a compact immersed surface has more than two vertices are the simply connected space forms .",
    "finally one may ask what are all surfaces which satisfy the condition of the last theorem if the word  immersed \" is replaced by  embedded \" . obviously , surfaces of the above theorems would then fall into that category , but there are more examples :    [ thm:3 ] the only complete riemannian surfaces where every closed curve which bounds a compact _ embedded surface _ has more than two vertices are orientable space forms of genus zero , flat tori , and rescalings of @xmath5 .",
    "we recall that an orientable surface of genus zero is one that is homeomorphic to @xmath3 minus a totally disconnected subset @xcite .",
    "the above theorems are proved in the next three sections below .",
    "the proofs of theorems [ thm:1 ] and [ thm:3 ] employ some basic curve shortening and certain perturbation results for closed geodesics or horocycles in hyperbolic surfaces .",
    "an important lemma utilized here is a result of jackson @xcite who showed that kneser s four vertex property holds only in surfaces with constant curvature .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm:2 ] also uses this lemma , together with an explicit example of a rather remarkable cylindrical curve which has only two vertices but bounds a compact immersed surface ( figure [ fig : cylinder ] ) . a general result for perturbing closed geodesics to curves with only two vertices",
    "is discussed in the appendix .",
    "four vertex theorems have spawned a vast and diverse literature since the first version of the theorem was proved in 1909 by mukhopadhyaya @xcite , who showed that convex planar curves have four vertices .",
    "this is the only version mentioned in nearly all differential geometry textbooks , with the exceptions of where the more general theorem of kneser is discussed , see also @xcite . pinkall s paper @xcite and related work @xcite offer other more general proofs as well , based on a number of ideas .",
    "for more recent proofs see @xcite which use curvature flow and sturm theory .",
    "another recent development is concerned with a converse of kneser s theorem @xcite .",
    "there are also interesting generalizations to space curves , connections with contact geometry @xcite , polygonal analogues @xcite , and a version for surfaces with boundary @xcite . see @xcite for a physical application , and for some more references and historical remarks .",
    "we begin by recording the result of jackson mentioned above :    [ lem : jackson ] let @xmath0 be a riemannian surface with curvature @xmath6 and let @xmath7 be a point of @xmath0 .",
    "suppose that @xmath7 is not a stationary point of @xmath6 , i.e , @xmath8 .",
    "then there exists an @xmath9 such that for all @xmath10 , the metric circle of radius @xmath11 centered at @xmath7 has only two vertices .",
    "thus we may confine our attention to complete riemannian surfaces @xmath0 of constant curvature @xmath6 , or @xmath12-dimensional _ space forms _ , as far as proving theorem [ thm:1 ] is concerned .",
    "furthermore , we may assume that @xmath0 is not simply connected due to the following fact : let @xmath13 denote the unit sphere and @xmath14 be the poincar half - plane with its standard metric of constant curvature @xmath15 ; then we have :    [ lem : maeda ] the stereographic projection @xmath16 and the inclusion map @xmath17 preserve the sign of the derivative of the geodesic curvature of curves .",
    "thus kneser s theorem holds in all simply connected @xmath12-dimensional space forms .",
    "the property of the stereographic projection mentioned above was already known to kneser @xcite , and the property of the inclusion map for the poincar disk was proved by maeda @xcite ; but the poincar disk and half - plane are equivalent up to a mbius transformation , which establishes the corresponding fact for the poincar half - plane , since mbius transformations preserve vertices @xcite .",
    "essentially , these observations are consequences of the fact that the stereographic projection and the inclusion map of the upper half - plane send circles to circles , and the vertices occur when the curve has third order contact with its osculating circle .",
    "it remains to consider non - simply connected @xmath12-dimensional space forms @xmath0 .",
    "we may assume , after a rescaling , that the curvature @xmath6 of @xmath0 is @xmath18 , @xmath19 , or @xmath15 . then by the hopf - killing theorem @xcite , @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath3 , or @xmath4 and @xmath22 is a discreet subgroup of isometries of @xmath23 which acts freely and properly discontinuously on @xmath23 .",
    "in particular , the projection @xmath24 is a riemannian covering map .",
    "we also recall that @xmath22 is isometric to the fundamental group @xmath25 .",
    "indeed , for any point @xmath26 , @xmath27 with @xmath28 , and closed curve @xmath29\\to m$ ] with @xmath30 , if @xmath31\\to x$ ] is the lifting of @xmath32 with @xmath33 , then there exists a unique element @xmath34 such @xmath35 .",
    "this correspondence , which will be utilized a number of times below , establishes the isomorphism between @xmath22 and @xmath25 .      if @xmath36 , then @xmath0 is the real projective plane @xmath37 . by a theorem of mbius @xcite ,",
    "see note [ note : mobius ] below for other references , any simple closed noncontractible curve @xmath38 in @xmath5 has at least three _ inflection points _ , i.e. , points where the geodesic curvature vanishes .",
    "but there must be at least one vertex between every pair of inflections .",
    "thus @xmath38 must have at least three vertices . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath38 is contractible , then it lifts to a pair of simple closed curves in @xmath3 , each of which must have four vertices by kneser s theorem .",
    "since the covering map is one - to - one on each of these curves , it then follows that @xmath38 must have at least four vertices .",
    "so we conclude then that all simple closed curves in @xmath5 must have at least three vertices .",
    "( note that in a nonorientable surface , the geodesic curvature in only well - defined locally and up to a sign ; however , this is enough to allow one to talk about vertices and inflection points . )    in the remaining cases we construct explicit examples of simple closed curves with only two vertices , by perturbing geodesics or horocycles of @xmath0 .      if @xmath39 , then @xmath40 where there are exactly four types of possibilities for @xmath22 corresponding to the cases of cylinder , twisted cylinder , torus , or klein bottle @xcite . in each of these cases",
    "@xmath0 contains a simple closed geodesic @xmath38 , as may be easily seen by looking at the fundamental region of these surfaces which is either a rectangle or an infinite strip in @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath41 be a parametrization of @xmath38 by arclength ( where @xmath42 denotes the length of @xmath38 ) , and @xmath43 be a lifting of @xmath32 to @xmath2 .",
    "then @xmath43 traces a line which we may assume to be the @xmath44-axis .",
    "let @xmath34 be the unique element such that @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath45 is either the  translation \" @xmath46 or the  glide reflection \" @xmath47 and we define , respectively , @xmath48 for some @xmath49 . then the image of @xmath50 is invariant under the action of @xmath45 .",
    "consequently , if @xmath51 denotes the covering map , then @xmath52 traces a smooth closed curve in @xmath0 with only one or two vertices .",
    "further note that , as @xmath53 , @xmath50 converges to @xmath43 , and consequently @xmath52 converges to @xmath54 with respect to the @xmath55-norm .",
    "so since @xmath32 is simple , it follows that @xmath52 will be simple as well for sufficiently small @xmath56 .",
    "if @xmath57 , or @xmath0 is a hyperbolic surface , we need to establish a basic structure theorem first . recall that an _ end _ of a surface is a nested sequence of subsets which eventually lie outside any given compact subset .",
    "each element of this sequence is called an _ end representative _ , and two ends are equivalent if each representative of one end lies in a representative of the other .",
    "cusp _ of a hyperbolic surface is an end with a representative which is isometric to a representative @xmath58 of the",
    " thin \" end of the _ parabolic cylinder _",
    "@xmath59 where @xmath22 is generated by the parabolic translations @xmath46 ; more explicitly , a cusp representative may be defined as @xmath60 for some @xmath61 .",
    "alternatively , a cusp may be visualized as an end of the tapering surface of revolution in @xmath62 known as the _",
    "pseudosphere_.    [ prop : simpleclosed ] every non - simply connected complete hyperbolic surface contains a simple closed geodesic or a cusp .    in the special case where the surface is orientable and has finite euler characteristic , the above proposition follows from a result in the recent book of borthwick ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.16 ) . with the aid of this result , and some curve shortening",
    ", we give the more general proof which we seek .",
    "first we need to establish the following lemma . if @xmath0 were orientable , this lemma would follow from basic results on curve shortening flow by curvature ; however , when @xmath0 is not orientable , the geodesic curvature is not well - defined along the entire curve ; hence we use the  disk flow \" method devised in which does not require orientability .    [",
    "lem : isotope ] let @xmath0 be a complete riemannian surface and @xmath38 be a simple closed curve of length @xmath42 in @xmath0 .",
    "suppose that @xmath38 is not isotopic to a point and the set of all curves in the isotopy class of @xmath38 whose lengths are bounded above by @xmath42 are confined to a compact region of @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath38 is isotopic to a simple closed geodesic .",
    "if @xmath0 is compact , the lemma follows immediately from .",
    "but the proof of shows that compactness is needed only so that one can apply ascoli s theorem to conclude that any length non - increasing homotopy @xmath63 has a convergent subsequence . of course one may draw the same conclusion as long as @xmath63 is confined to a compact subset of @xmath0 , which we assume is the case .",
    "next we use the previous lemma to establish another basic fact :    [ lem : mobius ] every complete non - orientable riemannian surface contains a simple closed geodesic , which has a tubular neighborhood homeomorphic to a mbius strip .",
    "if a complete riemannian surface @xmath0 is nonorientable then it must contain a mbius band @xmath64 .",
    "let @xmath38 be a smooth simple closed curve which is a retraction of @xmath64 .",
    "by the isotopy extension lemma @xcite , if @xmath65 is any curve in @xmath0 which is isotopic to @xmath38 , then @xmath65 will also have a neighborhood @xmath66 which is homeomorphic to a mbius band and retracts onto @xmath65 .",
    "this yields the following two observations .",
    "first , @xmath38 is not isotopic to a point , because every surface is locally orientable .",
    "second , no curve homotopic to @xmath38 may be disjoint from @xmath38 .",
    "this is due to the fact that there exists a smooth curve @xmath65 homotopic to @xmath38 which intersects @xmath38 only once , see figure [ fig : mobius ] .",
    "next note that any curve @xmath67 homotopic to @xmath38 will be homotopic to @xmath65 as well .",
    "suppose now , towards a contradiction , that @xmath67 is disjoint from @xmath38 .",
    "then , if @xmath68 denotes the intersection number , we have @xmath69 by the invariance of intersection number under homotopy @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath70 .",
    "this shows that any _ length nonincreasing _",
    "isotopy of @xmath38 must be confined within a compact region of @xmath0 ( if length of @xmath38 is @xmath42 , then this region would consist of points of @xmath0 which are within a distance @xmath71 of @xmath38 ) .",
    "it follows then , via lemma [ lem : isotope ] , that @xmath38 is isotopic to a simple closed geodesic .",
    "we need only one other basic result before proving proposition [ prop : simpleclosed ] .",
    "a _ hyperbolic cylinder _ is the quotient @xmath59 where @xmath22 is generated by the hyperbolic translations @xmath72 .",
    "thus a hyperbolic cylinder contains a simple closed geodesic , i.e. , the image of the positive half of the @xmath73-axis , which cuts the cylinder in half . following borthwick @xcite we define a _ funnel _ , as one of these halves .",
    "we say that a surface is _ topologically finite _ if it is homeomorphic to a compact surface minus a finite set of points .",
    "[ lem : borthwick ] every non - simply connected noncompact complete orientable hyperbolic surface with finite topology has a cusp or funnel end .",
    "if our hyperbolic surface @xmath74 is homeomorphic to an annulus , or , equivalently , @xmath0 is orientable and @xmath22 has only one generator , then that generator is conjugate to either a parabolic or hyperbolic translation of @xmath4 , which we defined above .",
    "consequently @xmath0 is isometric to either the parabolic cylinder or hyperbolic cylinder , in which case @xmath0 has a cusp or funnel end respectively , and we are done . on the other hand , if @xmath0 is not homeomorphic to an annulus ( and",
    "is not simply connected ) , then @xmath0 will be  nonelementary \" and the proof follows from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm . 2.13 ) which classifies the ends of nonelementary geometrically finite orientable hyperbolic surfaces .",
    "to apply this classification result , we just need to note that since @xmath0 is topologically finite , it is  geometrically finite \" as well ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.10 ) , i.e. , @xmath22 is finitely generated , or , equivalently , the fundamental region of @xmath0 is a finite - sided convex polygon in @xmath4 .",
    "now we are ready to prove proposition [ prop : simpleclosed ] :    by lemma [ lem : mobius ] we may suppose that our surface , say @xmath0 , is orientable .",
    "it is well - known that every compact non - simply connected orientable surface contains a simple closed geodesic , e.g. , this follows from lemma [ lem : isotope ] ; or see ( * ? ? ?",
    "9.6 ) for the hyperbolic case .",
    "so we may also suppose that @xmath0 is noncompact .",
    "then , if @xmath0 has finite topology , by lemma [ lem : borthwick ] , one of the ends of @xmath0 must be a  cusp \" or a  funnel \" @xcite . in either case",
    "we would be done since , by definition , funnels are bounded by simple closed geodesics .",
    "so it remains to consider the case where @xmath0 has infinite topology , although all we need is that @xmath0 have at least four ends .",
    "then we show that @xmath0 must have a simple closed geodesic as follows .    by the generalized jordan curve theorem",
    ", any simple closed curve @xmath75 divides @xmath0 into two components .",
    "choose @xmath75 so that each of the components of @xmath76 contains at least two ends of @xmath0 , and @xmath75 is rectifiable .",
    "then let @xmath63 be a length nonincreasing isotopy of @xmath75 , e.g. , as defined by hass and scott .",
    "note that , by the isotopy extension lemma @xcite , the topology of @xmath77 does not depend on @xmath78 .",
    "let @xmath79 be a continuous choice of a component of @xmath77 , and @xmath80 be an end representative of @xmath0 which does not contain all ends of @xmath0 that are in @xmath81 .",
    "then @xmath63 can not be contained entirely in @xmath82 for any time @xmath78 , because then @xmath79 would be disjoint from some of the ends of @xmath81 .",
    "now let @xmath83 be another end representative such that the distance of @xmath84 from @xmath85 is bigger than @xmath71 were @xmath42 is the length of @xmath75 .",
    "then @xmath86 for all @xmath78 .",
    "similarly , for each end of @xmath0 we may choose an end representative which will always be disjoint from @xmath63 .",
    "then the complement of all these end representatives is a compact subset of @xmath0 which contains @xmath63 for all @xmath78 , and so we may apply lemma [ lem : isotope ] to complete the proof .",
    "having proved proposition [ prop : simpleclosed ] , we may now proceed with the rest of the proof of theorem [ thm:1 ] by considering the following two cases :    [ [ section ] ]    if our hyperbolic surface @xmath74 contains a cusp , then it contains a _ horocycle _ ,",
    "i.e. , a simple closed curve @xmath87 which lifts to a horizontal line @xmath88",
    ". then let @xmath50 be the perturbation of @xmath43 given by @xmath89 see figure [ fig : horocycle ] .",
    "recall that there is a unique element @xmath34 , given by @xmath35 , which in this case is the parabolic translation @xmath90 .",
    "further , as we argued in section [ subsec : parabolic ] , since @xmath50 is also invariant with respect to @xmath45 , the projection @xmath52 is a smooth closed curve in @xmath0 with only two vertices for any @xmath91 , by lemma [ lem : maeda ] .",
    "furthermore , again as @xmath53 , @xmath50 converges to @xmath43 with respect to the @xmath55 norm .",
    "thus , since @xmath32 is simple , @xmath52 will be simple as well .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    if @xmath74 contains a simple closed geodesic @xmath41 , then it lifts to a geodesic @xmath92 .",
    "we may assume that @xmath43 traces the upper half of the @xmath73-axis in its positive direction , and @xmath93 .",
    "then @xmath94 ( recall that the hyperbolic distance of @xmath95 from @xmath96 is given by @xmath97 ) . as",
    "before , let @xmath34 be the ( unique ) element such that @xmath98",
    ". then @xmath45 is either the hyperbolic translation @xmath99 or the glide reflection @xmath100 , depending on wether or not small tubular neighborhoods of @xmath32 are orientable .",
    "so there are two cases to consider :    if @xmath45 is the hyperbolic translation ( i.e. , a tubular neighborhood of @xmath32 in @xmath0 is orientable ) , let @xmath101 see figure [ fig : esine ] .",
    "note that @xmath102 , i.e. , the image of @xmath50 is invariant under the action of @xmath45 . thus @xmath52 is a smooth closed curve in @xmath0 , and choosing @xmath56 sufficiently small we can make sure that @xmath52 is simple as we argued in section [ subsec : parabolic ] .",
    "finally note that @xmath50 has only two vertices on the interval @xmath103 $ ] .",
    "thus , the projection of @xmath52 will have only two vertices , again by lemma [ lem : maeda ] .    if @xmath45 is the glide reflection ( i.e. , no neighborhood of @xmath32 in @xmath0 is orientable ) let @xmath104 then the image of @xmath50 is invariant under the action of @xmath45 and @xmath52 again yields the desired curve for small @xmath56 , which completes the proof of theorem [ thm:1 ] .",
    "we record below the last part of the proof for future reference :    [ lem : approx ] any closed geodesic or horocycle in a hyperbolic surface is @xmath105-close to a closed curve with no more than two vertices .",
    "[ note : mobius ] the theorem of mbius mentioned above is equivalent to the statement that every simple closed curve @xmath38 in @xmath3 which is symmetric with respect to the antipodal reflection ( @xmath106 ) has at least six inflection points . since the antipodal reflection switches the sign of geodesic curvature ,",
    "the number of inflection points of @xmath38 must be @xmath107 where @xmath108 is odd .",
    "so , it is enough to show that @xmath38 has more than two inflections . in this sense , the theorem of mbius may be viewed as a special case of the  tennis ball theorem \" @xcite which proves the existence of at least four inflections for curves which bisect the area of @xmath3 .",
    "the latter result in turn follows from a theorem of segre @xcite who proved that any simple closed curve on @xmath3 which contains the origin in its convex hull must have at least four inflection points .",
    "another proof of segre s theorem may be found in @xcite .",
    "for other refinements or results related to the theorem of mbius see , .",
    "let @xmath0 be a complete riemannian surface satisfying the hypothesis of theorem [ thm:2 ] .",
    "by lemma [ lem : jackson ] , and after a rescaling , we may again assume that @xmath0 has constant curvature @xmath36 , @xmath18 , or @xmath15 which result in the following three cases respectively :      recall that here @xmath0 is the real projective plane @xmath37 .",
    "in this case we may construct an explicit example of a curve with only two vertices , which bounds an immersed compact surface , as shown in figure [ fig : loop ] .        in this picture",
    ", @xmath5 is represented as a hemisphere of @xmath3 , say the northern hemisphere , with the antipodal points on its boundary , or the equator , identified , and we are looking at this hemisphere from  above \" ( i.e. , in a direction orthogonal to the plane of the equator ) .",
    "alternatively , the above picture may be regarded as that of a unit disk , and then we may transfer the depicted region to a hemisphere via a stereographic projection , which preserves the number of vertices by lemma [ lem : maeda ] .",
    "note that the points where the curve intersects the boundary of the hemisphere are inflection points .      in this case @xmath40 where @xmath22 has at most two generators one of which must be a translation or a glide reflection @xcite .",
    "but the composition of two glide reflections is a translation .",
    "thus @xmath22 must contain a subgroup @xmath109 generated by a translation .",
    "then the projection @xmath110 yields a covering of @xmath0 by a cylinder .",
    "thus it is enough to show that every flat cylinder contains a closed curve with only two vertices which bounds a compact immersed surface . then the covering map yields the corresponding examples in all other topological types of flat surfaces ( the twisted cylinder , the torus , and the klein bottle ) .",
    "so we may suppose that @xmath0 is a flat cylinder , i.e. , @xmath111 which is the quotient of @xmath2 modulo the horizontal translations @xmath112 .",
    "alternatively , we may think of @xmath0 as the fundamental region @xmath113\\times{\\mathbf{r}}\\subset{\\mathbf{r}}^2 $ ] with its right and left hand sides identified .",
    "then the curve we seek is depicted in the left hand side of figure [ fig : cylinder ] , and the picture on the right shows a lifting of that curve in @xmath2 . note that the curve on the cylinder bounds a compact immersed surface .",
    "thus we only need to check that the given curve has only two vertices .",
    "indeed the curve on the right is given by @xmath114 where @xmath115 .",
    "to count the vertices of @xmath32 note that if we invert @xmath32 with respect to the unit circle and then translate it to the left by a distance of @xmath116 we obtain the curve given by @xmath117 in polar coordinates , see figure [ fig : gencardioid ] .",
    "a straight forward computation then shows that the derivative of the curvature of @xmath11 is given by @xmath118 thus @xmath11 has only two vertices which occur at @xmath119 and @xmath120 , and one may easily check that both are nondegenerate critical points of curvature .",
    "hence @xmath32 has only two vertices as well , since mbius transformations preserve vertices @xcite , as we had pointed out earlier .",
    "finally , if @xmath32 has only two vertices as a curve in @xmath2 then it has only two vertices in @xmath4 as well , by lemma [ lem : maeda ] .",
    "another example of a closed curve on the torus , or the klein bottle , which has only two vertices but bounds a compact immersed surface is depicted in figure [ fig : torus ] .",
    "note that although this example is more simple than that of figure [ fig : cylinder ] , it does not work on the cylinder or twisted cylinder because the region that it bounds would not be compact in those surfaces .",
    "although the example of figure [ fig : cylinder ] bounds a compact immersed surface in the cylinder , the lifting of that curve does not bound any such surface in the plane .",
    "the conditions for a closed planar curve to bound a compact immersed disk were first described in the thesis of blank @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for further refinements and generalizations of that result .",
    "recall that in this case , by proposition [ prop : simpleclosed ] , @xmath0 either has a cusp , or a simple closed geodesic .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    suppose first that @xmath0 has a cusp , then we may construct an example similar to that of figure [ fig : cylinder ] on @xmath0 because cusps are asymptotic to cylinders .",
    "more precisely , recall that a cusp is isometric to an end of a pseudosphere , which we may think of as a surface of revolution @xmath121 about the @xmath122-axis in @xmath62 .",
    "note that @xmath121 contains a meridian @xmath123 of length @xmath124 for every sufficiently small @xmath124 .",
    "after a vertical translation we may assume that @xmath123 lies on the @xmath125-plane .",
    "further , after a homothety of @xmath62 , we may assume that @xmath123 has length @xmath126 .",
    "thus we obtain a sequence of surfaces @xmath127 which converge to the cylinder @xmath58 given by @xmath128 , within any given compact ball @xmath129 centered at the origin of @xmath62 , as @xmath130 .",
    "in particular , for small @xmath124 , @xmath58 and @xmath127 will be @xmath105-close in @xmath129 , and thus any curve in @xmath131 may be projected into @xmath127 by moving it along the normals to @xmath58",
    ". the new curve will be @xmath105 close to the original one , and thus will have the same number of vertices as the original curve if all the vertices of the original curve are nondegenerate critical points of curvature , which , as we verified earlier , is the case in the example of figure [ fig : cylinder ] .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    now suppose that @xmath0 has a simple closed geodesic @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath38 lifts to a geodesic in the upper half - plane @xmath4 , and after an isometry , we may suppose that this lifting traces the positive half of the @xmath73-axis . also recall that homotheties of @xmath2 are isometries of @xmath4 .",
    "we can use these homotheties by constructing an example similar to that of figure [ fig : cylinder ] along the @xmath73-axis , see figure [ fig : cylinder2 ] .",
    "the curves depicted in this picture are rescalings of each other by a ( euclidean ) factor of @xmath132 where @xmath42 is the length of @xmath38 .",

    "if @xmath134 , or a rescaling of @xmath5 , then @xmath38 has at least three inflection points by mbius s theorem , as we pointed out in section [ subsec : elliptic ] .",
    "if @xmath0 is an orientable surface of genus zero or a torus , then @xmath38 must bound a disk in @xmath0 .",
    "consequently @xmath38 lifts to a simple closed curve in the universal cover of @xmath0 , and then it follows from kneser s theorem and lemma [ lem : maeda ] that @xmath38 must have at least four vertices .    to complete the proof of theorem [ thm:3 ] it remains then to show that if @xmath0 is not an orientable space form of genus zero , flat torus , or a rescaling of @xmath5 , then it must contain a simple close curve @xmath38 which bounds a compact surface but has no more than two vertices .",
    "again , by lemma [ lem : jackson ] , we may assume that @xmath0 has constant curvature .",

    "the next result shows that we may assume that @xmath0 is orientable as well :    any nonorientable complete surface of nonpositive curvature contains a simple closed curve with only two vertices which bounds a compact embedded surface .",
    "first recall that , by lemma [ lem : mobius ] , any nonorientable complete riemannian surface @xmath0 contains a simple closed geodesic @xmath87 which has a tubular neighborhood homeomorphic to a mbius strip .",

    "if the universal cover of @xmath0 is @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath0 has zero curvature , then we may suppose , for convenience , that @xmath43 traces the @xmath44-axis",
    ". now let @xmath135 and note that these curves are invariant under the group of  glide reflections \" @xmath47 , see figure [ fig : horocycle2 ] .",
    "thus the covering map @xmath136 sends these curves to a single closed curve with only two vertices in @xmath0 which converges to @xmath32 with respect to the @xmath55-norm as @xmath53 .",
    "in particular , this curve will be embedded for small @xmath56 .",
    "if the universal cover of @xmath0 is @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath0 has negative curvature , then we may suppose that @xmath43 traces the positive half of @xmath73-axis in the positive direction and @xmath93",
    ". now let @xmath137 and again note that these curves are invariant under the group of  glide reflections \" @xmath138 , see figure [ fig : esine2 ] .",
    "thus the covering map",
    "@xmath139 once again sends these curves to the desired curve for small @xmath56 .",
    "now recall that the only orientable parabolic @xmath12-dimensional space forms other than the tori are the cylinders and the euclidean plane , both of which have genus zero .",
    "thus we may assume that @xmath0 has negative curvature , and observe that    every complete orientable hyperbolic surface @xmath0 of nonzero genus contains a simple closed geodesic or a horocycle which bounds a compact subset of @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath0 has nonzero genus , and is not a torus , it is the connected sum of a torus @xmath140 with a noncontractible surface @xmath141 ; this follows from the normalization theorem of richards @xcite which states that any orientable surface is homeomorphic to the connected sum of @xmath3 with a countable number of tori and minus a totally disconnected subset .",
    "thus there exists a simple closed curve @xmath38 which divides @xmath0 into two components : one homeomorphic to @xmath140 minus a disk and the other homeomorphic to @xmath141 minus a disk",
    ". now let @xmath63 be the curve shortening flow devised in .",
    "then as we argued in the proof of proposition [ prop : simpleclosed ] , @xmath63 either converges to a simple closed geodesic or else eventually enters every representative of an end of @xmath0 .",
    "the latter case may happen only if that end is a cusp and @xmath63 is isotopic to a horocycle of that cusp .",
    "the proof is then complete once we recall that , by the isotopy extension lemma @xcite , the topology of @xmath77 is independent of @xmath78 .",
    "in particular , the closure of one of the components of @xmath77 will be homeomorphic to @xmath140 minus an open disk , which is a compact region of @xmath0 .    by lemma [ lem : approx ]",
    ", we may now perturb the curve given by the last result to obtain a simple closed curve with only two vertices , which completes the proof .",
    "in section [ sec : hyperbolic ] we showed that any closed geodesic in a hyperbolic surface may be perturbed , in the @xmath105 sense , to a closed curve with only two vertices . here",

    "the proof of this result follows from the following three lemmas .",
    "the basic idea here is again to perturb the geodesic in the direction of its normals according to a sine curve . to this end",
    "we first show that a neighborhood of @xmath38 in @xmath0 may be represented as a surface of revolution in @xmath62 .",
    "this observation , via the above theorem , shows that the only closed geodesics which can not be perturbed to curves with only two vertices correspond to great circles in spheres ( there are still many other examples of closed geodesics in noncomplete surfaces of constant positive curvature , which may be perturbed to curves with only two vertices , provided only that the length condition in the above theorem is satisfied . ) .",
    "[ lem : isometry ] let @xmath0 and @xmath141 be riemannian surfaces of constant curvature @xmath6 which contain simple closed geodesics @xmath38 and @xmath65 with orientable neighborhoods . then there exist open neighborhoods @xmath64 and @xmath66 of @xmath38 and @xmath65 , respectively , and an isometry @xmath143 which maps @xmath38 to @xmath65 .",
