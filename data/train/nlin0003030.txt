    "a few years ago , bak , tang and wiesenfeld introduced the concept of the `` self - organized criticality '' ( soc ) in sand pile model  @xcite . from then on ,",
    "this concept has been widely studied in some extended dissipative dynamical systems , such as earthquake  @xcite , biology evolution  @xcite , and so on .",
    "it is shown that all these systems can naturally evolve into a `` critical state '' with no intrinsic spatial and temporal scales through a self - organized process without the need to fine - tune parameters of the system .",
    "this critical state is characterized by a power - law distribution of avalanche sizes , where the size is the total number of toppling events or unstable units .",
    "now , the research on soc has come into a new level .",
    "one has studied several factors influence on soc behavior , such as network size , periodic or nonperiodic boundary conditions , local dynamics variable is conservative or not , and so on .",
    "many investigators believe that it is intrinsic - stability(order ) and variability(disorder ) s common action make the system evolves into a `` frozen disorder '' ( soc ) state  @xcite .",
    "it is the combination feature of stability and variability , and it s complex spatial - temporal dynamic behavior , make the system in soc state have maximum complexity and latent computing potency .    the brain is a complex system and its information process has the properties of stability and variability  on one hand , there are relative stable information stored mechanism , and stored area in brain(such as feature area in cortex ) ; on the other hand , the brain is influenced by the environment and one should continuous update knowledge and concepts .",
    "the similarity between the soc systems and the brain has lead us to study artifical neural network(ann ) and soc together .",
    "there is some soc behavior shown in the neuron network model introduced by our group  @xcite .",
    "the brain is also a complex system with highly complexity , highly order and special structure .",
    "the structure must have the effect on the brain s dynamics behavior .",
    "our neuron network can also produce some special structure , so we believe that the soc behavior shown in our model must have it s own special behavior and rule .    in this paper , the feature area(produced by self - organized process )",
    "s definite effect on soc behavior has been studied .",
    "here we propose a two - dimensional neural network model of square lattice .",
    "this model is a kind of serial self - organized neural network model , based on the lissom model  @xcite . when a @xmath0- dimensional vector @xmath1 is inputted , the state @xmath2 of the neuron @xmath3 at time @xmath4 is changed according to the formula : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an active function , and we design it as sign function , i.e. , if @xmath7 , then @xmath8 , otherwise @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is an afferent input weight vector ; @xmath11 is the excitatory lateral connection weight on the connection from the neuron @xmath12 to the @xmath3 neuron ; @xmath13 is the inhibitory connection weight .",
    "@xmath14 is the local field of the neuron @xmath3 at time @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 are constant factors .",
    "the adjustment of those three connection weights is as following according to the dynamic hebb rule : @xmath17 ^ 2\\}^{1/2 } }   \\mbox { , }    \\\\",
    "\\nonumber & & e_{ij , kl}(t+1)=\\frac{e_{ij , h}(t)+\\alpha_e \\eta_{ij } \\eta_{kl } } { \\sum_{ij } \\left[e_{ij , kl}(t)+\\alpha_e \\eta_{ij } \\eta_{kl}\\right ] }   \\mbox { , }   \\\\   & &   i_{ij , k^\\prime l^\\prime } ( t+1)=\\frac{i_{ij , k^\\prime l^\\prime}(t)+ \\alpha_i \\eta_{ij } \\eta_{k^\\prime l^\\prime } } { \\sum_{k^\\prime l^\\prime}\\left[i_{ij,{k^\\prime l^\\prime}}(t)+ \\alpha_i \\eta_{ij } \\eta_{k^\\prime l^\\prime } \\right ] }   \\mbox{.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 are the learning rates .",
    "note the change of the neuron states is quick and the adjustment of the connection weights is slow .",
    "usually , after over 10 iterations of the neuron states when any pattern is inputted ( at this time , the network state becomes an attractor in the state space , often a fixed point . ) , all connection weights are updated once .",
    "thus , after learning a while , the lateral connection weight self - evolves into the``mexican hat '' profile , the afferent input weight self - organizes into a topological map of the input space , the neuron network can produce some special feature areas , and the state of the neural network is evolved from disordered case to stable and topological case in state space .",
    "then we introduce the following interactive process between the neurons , similar with the pulse coupled interaction :    \\1 ) when the neuron @xmath3 is stable , i.e. , @xmath19 , it does nt influence the others ;    \\2 ) if the neuron @xmath3 is unstable , i.e. , @xmath20 or @xmath21 , then the nearest neighbors @xmath22 around this unstable neuron will receive a pulse respectively and their local fields will be changed . at the same time , the neuron @xmath3 becomes stable again , depending on the formula ( 1 ) ;    \\3 ) when all neurons of the neural network are stable , we choose the minimum @xmath23 among the absolute values of all local fields @xmath24 and drive the local field of every neuron , i.e. , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a constant .",
    "now , we present the computer simulation procedure of this model in detail :    \\1 ) variable initialization . in the 2-dimensional @xmath27 neural network model ,",
    "let the initiatory state and local field equal @xmath28 ; random initialize each connection weight among @xmath29 $ ] ; and produce @xmath30 random input patterns , @xmath31 $ ] , @xmath32 .",
    "\\2 ) learning process .",
    "according to formula ( 1 ) , we input the pattern circularly and iterate the neuron state and local field . after period of time ,",
    "the space state of the network reaches stability and we consider the @xmath30 input patterns have been stored .",
    "\\3 ) associative memory .",
    "input a new pattern , and then search the unstable neuron @xmath3 as defined above in whole neural network . due to being unstable , the neuron @xmath3 discharges a pulse to the each nearest neighbor @xmath33 and thus causes the local fields of them to change as following : @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents the pulse intensity , symbol latexmath:[$|\\     simultaneously , according to formula ( 1 ) , the neuron @xmath3 becomes stable as : @xmath37 , @xmath38 ; where @xmath6 is sign function .",
    "repeat this procedure until all neurons of the model are stable .",
    "define one avalanche as all unstable neurons in this process .",
    "then begin drive process by formula ( 3 ) and new avalanche .",
    "recently , bak and sneppen have investigated the power law distribution @xmath39 of the distances @xmath40 between subsequent unstable sites in lattice of bs biology evolution model  @xcite , and j.de.boer et al .",
    "have found some interested result with it  @xcite.so in this paper we studied not only the distribution @xmath41 of the avalanche sizes @xmath42 but also the distribution @xmath39 of the distances @xmath40 between the subsequent unstable sites .",
    "we find the distribution will deviate from the power law in some conditions .",
    "the size of our lattice is @xmath43.we find that in associative memory process , the distribution of the avalanche sizes has power - law behavior , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "it is shown in fig.1.a .",
    "the distribution @xmath39 of the distances @xmath40 between the subsequent unstable sites has power - law behavior too , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , it is shown in fig.1.b .",
    "the soc behavior changed with the scope of lateral connection has been studied .",
    "we increase the excitatory lateral connection radius @xmath48 and the inhibitory connection radius @xmath49 .",
    "it can be seen in fig 1.a that avalanche size and occurring probability of large scale avalanche decrease with the slope @xmath48 increasing , and the distribution of @xmath39 deviates from power law more and more in large @xmath40 , the probability of large distance @xmath40 between the subsequent unstable sites also increases , we consider it is a deviation from soc behavior , it is shown in fig 1.b .    by investigating , we think our system is in a `` partly - synchronized '' state , hence the dynamics behavior mentioned above can be seen .",
    "a.corral et al .",
    "propose soc state and synchronization state might be considered as two uttermost state of system ( just like two sides of the same coin )  @xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneity introduced by boundary or initialization conditions can propagate into interior of network , hence makes the system evolve into soc state  @xcite .",
    "when inhomogeneity is not large enough , the system finds a compromise between synchronization and soc  @xcite .",
    "it can be considered as a partly - synchronized state .",
    "if our model is only a pure ofc model without learning process , the system will present a macroscopic soc behavior among almost all the lattices , but it is also a neuron network model . as a kind of self - organized feature map model , after learning a while , it s neurons will develop a unique lateral interaction `` mexican hat '' profile that represents its long - term associations with each other .",
    "the afferent input weights will self - organize into a topological map of the input space  @xcite , it can form some special topological feature regions .",
    "we consider that in these regions , as the connection weights become more topographically ordered , neuron s synchronization effect between each other will be reinforced .",
    "when order in these regions is applied to the model , the system has a tendency from soc state to synchronized state .",
    "at last , the system finds a compromise between synchronization and soc , it could be seen as `` partly - synchronized '' state . with the process , the distribution of avalanche varies from the continuous distribution to a discrete one , the possibility of large scale avalanche propagating into the interior of the synchronization regions will reduce , and occurring probability of large scale avalanche will decrease too , the one - off isolated avalanche(only one unstable site in an avalanche)in these regions will increase greatly , it makes the distances @xmath40 between the subsequent unstable sites have a stochastic spatial even distribution in the area .",
    "this distribution has more effect on probability of large distance between unstable sites than probability of small distance .",
    "( because probability of small distance is larger than one of large distance . )    so at this moment , there are some areas in synchronized state and another regions in soc state",
    ". we can consider that with the increasing of @xmath48 , the feature region(synchronized region ) produced by self - organized process becomes wider , which results in the whole system dynamics deviating largely from soc state , it can be seen in fig.1 .    to verify the idea mentioned above ,",
    "we draw the avalanche s distribution map of the whole system .",
    "we draw one avalanche s distribution snapshot every 1000 avalanches , then overlap all the snapshots in one picture .",
    "the result can be seen in fig2 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the blank region ( seldom avalanche area ) expands with the increasing of @xmath48 .",
    "it means that the synchronized region introduced by self - organized expands and large scale avalanches reduce more and more .",
    "even though , there are still some isolated unstable neurons in the area , it indirectly verifies our deduction of @xmath50 distribution mentioned above .",
    "we investigate the relation between average avalanche size @xmath51 and radius @xmath48 . from fig.3",
    ", we can see that with the decreasing of @xmath48 , @xmath51 will increases , and with @xmath48 approaching 0 , the slope of the curve becomes quite large .",
    "this result is approximate to the phenomena with the increasing of pulse discharging intensity @xmath35  @xcite , and is consistent with the result in ref .",
    "it implies that the network approaches to soc state when @xmath48 approaching 0 or @xmath35 approaching 0.5 .",
    "when the ratio @xmath52 of radius @xmath53 with radius @xmath48 is changed , the probability distribution @xmath41 and @xmath39 and avalanche distribution are changed too , the tendency is similar to fig.1 , fig.2 . with the increment of @xmath52 , the partly - synchronized behavior of system",
    "becomes distinctness .",
    "the phenomena can also be explained by the expanding of synchronized region , but it leads us to think that the inhibitory lateral connection and excitatory lateral connection have what different effect on synchronized process ? it is look like that the inhibitory lateral connection has more important effect , but it is not very clear , there are still a lot of work to do .",
    "ofc earthquake model is a kind of soc model which has been widely studied in recent years  @xcite.if we use transformation in our model : @xmath54 , then formula ( 4 ) become @xmath55 .",
    "it is the avalanche mechanism of the ofc earthquake model , in fact these two models belong to the same class.therefore we add some synchronized regions in ofc model and examine that if the system has the similarity partly - synchronized behavior as in our neuron network model .",
    "hence we introduced a cellular automaton model based on ofc model , the steps are as follows :    \\1 ) we define a @xmath56 square lattice , and a @xmath57 square area in the lattice ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "\\2 ) initialize all sites to a random value @xmath59 between 0 and 1 .",
    "\\3 ) if any @xmath60,then redistribute the force on @xmath59 to its neighbors according to the rule : @xmath61  @xmath62    \\4 ) repeat step 3 until no @xmath63,we define the avalanche is fully evolved .",
    "\\5 ) locate the site with the largest strain , @xmath64 , then drive all sites @xmath65 and return to step 3 .",
    "here we use open boundary conditions , and serial working mode.it is same as our neuron network model but different from traditional ofc model .",
    "we still focus on the spatial distribution of @xmath42 and @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath66 , then change @xmath67 , the result is shown in fig 4 .",
    "it can be seen that the probability distribution @xmath39 increases and deviates from power - law more with @xmath67 increasing at larger @xmath40 in fig 4.a .",
    "the tendency is similar to that in our previous neuron network model . in fig 4.b",
    ", we can see the occurring probability of large scale avalanche reduces with @xmath67 increasing too , but the phenomena is not distinctness as that in previous model .",
    "the reason may be that the previous model has more complex structure than this model .",
    "it produces many pieces of synchronized region , but here , we only add a piece of synchronized region in model .",
    "a. corral , grassberger et al .",
    "have investigated the influence of pulse discharging intensity @xmath35 in ofc model .",
    "they propose the model present a macroscopic synchronization among all the elements of the lattice when @xmath35 is small  @xcite . therefore in this model , with expanding of @xmath68 area(@xmath69 ) , the synchronized area in the network expands , the synchronization behavior becomes distinctness , and the whole system evolves into a partly - synchronized state .",
    "the dynamics behavior of the previous model is so consistent with this model , it suggested that maybe they have the similar dynamics mechanism .",
    "our results tend to agree with this idea .    for studying the partly - synchronized phenomena further , the relation between distribution @xmath70 and @xmath71 has been investigated .",
    "let @xmath72 , the partly - synchronized behavior become distinctness with @xmath71 decreasing from 0.5 .",
    "but when @xmath71 less than a number ( about 0.4 ) , there is no more distinctness partly - synchronized behavior introduced by @xmath71 changing ( seen in fig 5 ) .",
    "it can show that the @xmath68 area have evolved into synchronized state .",
    "we also draw the whole network s avalanches distribution map(fig .6 ) .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the isolated avalanches number in @xmath68 area increases with @xmath71 decreasing , and the large scale avalanche ca nt propagate into the interior of @xmath68 area .",
    "these result are consistent with the work of c.tang , grassberger et al .  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we analyze the dynamics of the proposed neural network model and find the distribution of the avalanche sizes and the distances @xmath40 between subsequent unstable sites show the power - law behavior . more important",
    ", we find the function area and weight distribution produced by self - organized process in our neural network model will let the @xmath41 and @xmath39 distribution deviate from power law behavior , and the system evolves into a partly - synchronized state at this time . to verify the explanation , we study a quasi - ofc earthquake model containing synchronized region , and find it will deviate from power - law ,",
    "evolve into a partly - synchronized state in some conditions too .",
    "our self - organized feature map neuron network model is just a very simple simulation of brain .",
    "the real brain has very complex structure and more specific feature regions in cortex .",
    "so brain may express a quasi - soc(partly - synchronized ) behavior more than a pure soc behavior . therefore the stored pattern in brain",
    "might be designed as a quasi - soc attractor , and the associate memory process might be designed as the process of the input pattern evolving into the attractor .    now the neuron synchronization in brain has been observed in many experiments  @xcite .",
    "rodriguez et al . have investigated the long distance synchronization of human brain activity  @xcite .",
    "we think it would be interesting to further investigate the relationship between synchronization and cognitive , associate process .",
