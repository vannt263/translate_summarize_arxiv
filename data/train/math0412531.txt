    "this induces a hausdorff metric on the collection of non - empty closed subsets of @xmath3 : @xmath29    this problem arises in an overlap of topology and graph theory .",
    "graphs treated as topological spaces are well understood , as are configuration spaces of euclidean spaces .",
    "recently , abrams and ghrist introduced the notion of the @xmath1-point braid group of a graph ( see  @xcite for an overview of the area ) .",

    "we can now prove the following about @xmath0 :    [ graph ] the space @xmath0 is a one - dimensional polyhedron , i.e. , a graph .",
    "we define a set of vertices of @xmath0 by : @xmath58    there are two types of vertices in @xmath59 .",
    "a type i vertex is an element @xmath60 such that @xmath61 , as in figure  [ vertices]a .",
    "there is a bicorrespondence between vertices of this type and distributions of @xmath24 identical particles into the @xmath19 disjoint edges @xmath62 $ ] , and so there are @xmath63 of these type i vertices . on the other hand ,",

    "recall each configuration is uniquely determined by the numbers @xmath55 , by an integer @xmath56 where @xmath47 is a governing arm , and by the value @xmath57 . then let @xmath66 be the type i vertex uniquely determined by @xmath85=@xmath86 , by @xmath87 for all @xmath72 .",

    "there is a natural ordering on the sets @xmath46 and @xmath112 given by @xmath113 for @xmath114 or @xmath112 .",

    "[ group ] the braid group @xmath117 is free on @xmath121 generators where @xmath122    note that @xmath0 is one - dimensional and so has a free group as fundamental group .",
    "the rank can be computed from the euler characteristic @xmath123 of @xmath0 .",
    "we can count the edges in @xmath124 . since each edge contains exactly one vertex of type i , we need merely add the degrees of the type i vertices .",
    "each of the @xmath19 vertices @xmath66 which are contained entirely in one arm @xmath125 have degree @xmath126 because each is adjacent to the @xmath126 vertices @xmath67 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 for @xmath72 .",
    "on the other hand , the remaining @xmath65 type i vertices @xmath66 have degree @xmath19 because each is adjacent to @xmath19 different @xmath67 where @xmath129 for some @xmath56 and @xmath130 for all @xmath72 .",
    "thus @xmath131 we can also count the vertices since @xmath132 then @xmath133    by corollary  [ group ] , @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the free group on @xmath93 letters .",
    "see figure  [ dksn ] for the illustrations of @xmath0 as generated by the method in the proof of lemma  [ graph ] in these four cases .",
    "finally , theorem  [ def ] suggests a monomorphism which maps a basis of @xmath36 into a basis of @xmath5 :    [ gen ] let @xmath136 be a free basis for @xmath137 . then the standard simplicial map @xmath138 induces a monomorphism @xmath139 which maps @xmath7 injectively into @xmath4 .    whenever there is a simplicial inclusion @xmath140 for @xmath141 and @xmath142 one - dimensional complexes , their fundamental groups @xmath143 and @xmath144 are free with bases @xmath145 and @xmath146 such that @xmath147 is injective and @xmath148",
