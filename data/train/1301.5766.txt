    "the quantal features prevail for both pairs of conjugate coordinates considered .",
    "* restoring the rotational and the gauge symmetries is a pure quantum mechanical operation which results in having a pronounced quantal behavior for small deformation . *",
    "keeping in mind that the deformation itself is a classical variable , increasing its value the quantal features are diminished in favor of the classical ones . in that respect",
    "one could say that the deformation plays the role of a mediator of classical and quantal behaviors . *",
    "the share of classical and quantal features depends on the symmetry of the wave function . in the specific situations considered here , the more symmetric is the system the closer is its behavior to the classical picture , in a large deformation regime . *",
