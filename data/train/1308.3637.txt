    "a precise measurement of the thickness of neutron skin is important not only because it represents a basic nuclear property , but also because it constrains the symmetry - energy term of the nuclear equation of state @xcite .",
    "a detailed knowledge of the symmetry energy is essential for describing the structure of neutron - rich nuclei , and for modeling properties of neutron - rich matter in nuclear astrophysics applications .",
    "the pb radius experiment ( prex ) using parity - violating elastic electron scattering at jlab @xcite has initiated a new method to determine the neutron skin thickness of nuclei .",
    "presently the most precise value for the neutron - skin thickness has been obtained from a high - resolution study of electric dipole polarizability @xmath5 in @xmath0pb @xcite , and a respective correlation analysis of @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "measuring the strength of the giant dipole resonance in the whole energy range turned out to be an excellent tool for determining @xmath5 .",
    "the excitation of the isovector giant dipole resonance by an isoscalar probe , in particular inelastic @xmath7 scattering , was also used to extract the neutron - skin thickness of nuclei @xcite .",
    "the cross section of this process depends strongly on @xmath8 .",
    "another tool used earlier for studying the neutron - skin thickness is the excitation of the isovector spin giant dipole resonance ( ivsgdr )",

    "@xcite suggested another new method for determining the @xmath6 by measuring the energy of the gamow - teller resonance ( gtr ) relative to the isobaric analog state ( ias ) .",
    "constraints on the nuclear symmetry energy and neutron skin were also obtained recently from studies of the strength of the pygmy dipole resonance @xcite .    in this article",
    "we suggest a new method for determining the thickness of the neutron skin , based on the measured energy of the anti - analog of the giant dipole resonance ( agdr ) @xcite .",
    "we have used two sum rules for calculating the energy of the agdr .",
    "the non - energy - weighted sum rule ( newsr ) , which we used in an earlier study based on the ivsgdr @xcite , is valid ( apart from a factor of 3 ) also for the giant dipole resonance excited in charge - exchange reactions and predicts an increase in strength as a function of the neutron - skin thickness :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) denotes the integrated @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) strenghts , n and z are the neutron and proton number and @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the mean - square radii of the neutron and proton distributions , respectively .",
    "auerbach et al .",
    "@xcite derived an energy - weighted sum rule ( ewsr ) also for the dipole strength excited in charge - exchange reactions .",
    "the corresponding energies are measured with respect to the rpa ground - state energy ( ias state ) in the parent nucleus .",
    "the result of this ewsr is almost independent of the neutron - skin thickness @xcite .    @xmath16    where @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) denotes the energy",

    "the correction term @xmath25 is : @xmath26    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are parameters of the skyrme potential @xcite and @xmath29 is the coulomb potential .    if one neglects the @xmath11 strength as compared to the @xmath10 one , and assumes that the whole @xmath10 strength is concentrated in one single transition , then the mean energy of the dipole state should decrease with increasing dipole strength and therefore with increasing neutron - skin thickness in consequence of newsr .",
    "@xmath30    the strong sensitivity of the agdr energy on @xmath6 was noted also by krmpoti @xcite in a study that used the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .    in the present work ,",

    "we employ a family of density - dependent meson - exchange ( dd - me ) effective interactions , for which the constraint on the symmetry energy at saturation density was systematically varied : @xmath52 30 , 32 , 34 , 36 and 38 mev , and the remaining model parameters were adjusted to reproduce empirical nuclear - matter properties ( binding energy , saturation density , compression modulus ) , and the binding energies and charge radii of a standard set of spherical nuclei @xcite .",
    "these effective interactions were used to provide a microscopic estimate of the nuclear - matter incompressibility and symmetry energy in relativistic mean - field models  @xcite , and in ref .",
    "@xcite to study a possible correlation between the observed pygmy dipole strength ( pds ) in @xmath53sn and the corresponding values for the neutron - skin thickness .",
    "in addition to the set of effective interactions with @xmath54 250 mev ( this value reproduces the excitation energies of giant monopole resonances ) and @xmath52 30 , 32 , 34 , 36 and 38 mev , the relativistic functional dd - me2 @xcite is used here to calculate the excitation energies of the agdr with respect to the ias , as a function of the neutron skin .",
    "pertinent to the present analysis is the fact that the relativistic rpa with the dd - me2 effective interaction predicts for the dipole polarizability @xcite @xmath55 ( directly proportional to the inverse energy - weighted moment @xmath56 ) of @xmath0pb the value @xmath5=20.8 fm@xmath3 , in very good agreement with the recently measured value : @xmath58 fm@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "to explore the sensitivity of the centroid energy of the agdr to the neutron - skin thickness of @xmath0pb , we have performed rhb + pn - rqrpa calculations using a set of the effective interactions with different values of the symmetry energy at saturation : @xmath52 30 , 32 , 34 , 36 and 38 mev ( and correspondingly different slopes of the symmetry energy @xcite ) and , in addition , the dd - me2 effective interaction ( @xmath59 mev ) . in fig .",

    "[ skin124],width=302 ]    the experimental data for the agdr in @xmath0pb was taken from sterrenburg et al .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath61 mev ) , but slightly increased to @xmath62 mev in order to approximately compensate the effect of the energy shift caused by the mixing with the ivsgdr .",
    "austin et al .",
    "@xcite developed a phenomenological model to describe the variation with bombarding energy of the peak positions of the agdr and ivsgdr observed in ( @xmath31,@xmath32 ) reactions .",
    "they assumed that the position c of the centroid of the l=1 excitations ( including both the agdr and ivsgdr ) at a bombarding energy @xmath63 is given by the weighted average of the energies : @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the cross section for s=0 ( s=1 ) transfer .",
    "they estimated the @xmath67 ratio by : @xmath68 @xcite and obtained the energy of the @xmath69 in @xmath0pb to be 11.0 @xmath70 1.5 mev , which is completely different from any theoretical prediction @xcite .",
    "in reality , the centroid of the dipole strength distribution is usually determined by fitting the distribution by a gaussian or a lorentzian curve and not calculated numerically .",
    "this makes a large difference in case of @xmath71sn where the widths of the agdr and the ivsgdr are very different , 3.6 mev @xcite and 9 mev @xcite , respectively .    in order to determine the energy shift of the agdr peak at @xmath63 = 45 mev from the real peak energy , we simulated the mixing of the agdr and ivsgdr by using their real widths of 2.9 mev and 8.9 mev , their intensity ratio as approximated by austin et al .",
    "@xcite , and their energy difference of @xmath72=3.13 mev obtained from ref .",
    "@xcite and from ref .",
    "the composite spectrum was then fitted by a gaussian curve in a reasonably wide energy range ( @xmath70 5 mev around the position of the peak ) and an energy shift of 0.15 mev was obtained for the agdr .",
    "thus , the corrected energy of the agdr is : @xmath69 = 24.14 - 15.17 + 0.15 = 9.12 @xmath70 0.2 mev .",
    "we plan to measure the @xmath69 energy difference more precisely by observing the @xmath73-transition from the agdr to the ias .",
    "this transition is expected to be as strong as the @xmath73-decay of the well known gdr to the ground state .",
    "the two parallel solid lines in fig . 2",
    "delineate the region of theoretical uncertainty for the set of effective interactions with @xmath52 30 , 32 , 34 , 36 and 38 mev .",
    "an uncertainty of 10% was used for the differences between the neutron and proton radii for the nuclei @xmath74sn , @xmath71sn , and @xmath0pb in adjusting the parameters of these interactions @xcite .",
    "they were also used to calculate the electric dipole polarizability and neutron - skin thickness of @xmath0pb , @xmath75sn and @xmath76ca , in comparison to the predictions of more than 40 non - relativistic and relativistic mean - field effective interactions @xcite .",
    "from the results presented in that work one can also assess the accuracy of the present calculations .    by comparing the experimental result for @xmath60 to the theoretical calculations ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , we deduce the value of the neutron - skin thickness in @xmath0pb : @xmath77 fm ( including theoretical uncertainties ) . in table",
    "i the value for @xmath78 determined in the present analysis is compared to previous results obtained with a variety of experimental methods .",

    "the agreement between the @xmath6 determined using measurements of the agdr - ias and previous methods is very good .",

    "the method we have introduced provides not only stringent constraint to the neutron - skin thicknesses in nuclei under consideration , but it also offers new possibilities for measuring @xmath6 in rare - isotope beams , which was tested recently @xcite .",
