    "galaxy clustering measurements of large area surveys , such as the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , @xcite ) , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) , deep extragalactic evolutionary probe 2 redshift survey ( deep2 , @xcite ) , agn and galaxy evolution survey ( ages , @xcite ) , and vimos - vlt deep survey ( vvds , @xcite ) with many thousands of galaxies have quantified the clustering dependence on galaxy properties such as morphological type , luminosity , spectral type , and redshift to @xmath5 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the general trend is that red , more massive , brighter , and/or elliptical galaxies cluster more strongly than blue , less massive , fainter , and/or spiral galaxies .",
    "halo occupation distribution ( hod ) modelling of these results has shown that there is an almost linear increase in the mean number of satellite ( non - central ) galaxies as a function of increasing dark matter halo ( dmh ) mass ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .    compared to projected angular clustering measurements ,",
    "three dimensional ( 3d ) clustering measurements have greater statistical accuracy and minimize systematic errors associated with model assumptions in using limber s de - projection ( @xcite ) . however , 3d correlation functions require extremely large numbers of objects with secure redshift information .",
    "clustering measurements of the auto - correlation function ( acf ) of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) reveal how agns are spatially distributed in the universe .",
    "these measurements can constrain the agn host galaxies , determine the typical dmh mass in which agns reside and the distribution of agns with dhm mass , test theoretical model predictions , and address which physical processes are triggering agn activity ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , a major challenge in agn clustering measurements is to overcome the limitation caused by the low space density of agns .",
    "narrow emission line diagnostics ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) have been used to identify narrow - line agns at low redshifts .",
    "large sky area surveys with extensive spectroscopic follow - up programs have recently allowed narrow - line agn clustering measurements for samples of up to 90,000 agns ( @xcite ) .",
    "studies such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite explore the clustering strength of low redshift ( @xmath6 ) narrow - line agns samples with respect to various agn properties ( e.g. , black hole mass , radio emission ) .",
    "optically - selected narrow - line agns have a clustering strength similar to all galaxies ( both blue and red ) .",
    "narrow - line radio - loud agns cluster more strongly than agn without radio - emission and identical samples of quiescent galaxies .",
    "consequently , denser environment of galaxies increase the probability of hosting a narrow - line radio - loud agn .",
    "broad - line agns are , in general , more luminous than narrow - line agns .",
    "moreover , their energy production dominates over the host galaxy star light .",
    "large area optical surveys have spectroscopically identified tens of thousands of broad - line agns ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the co - moving number density of broad - line agns is very low in the low redshift universe ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the situation improves at higher redshifts as the co - moving agn number distribution peaks at @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , a given observed area corresponds at higher redshift to a larger observed co - moving volume .",
    "these two facts favor broad - line agn clustering measurements at @xmath9 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray surveys have also been used to select agns .",
    "these surveys cover much less sky area , e.g. , @xmath20.1 - 10 deg@xmath10 , than optical surveys .",
    "further , they sample lower agn luminosities than optical surveys and contain a significant fraction of obscured agns . in order to probe the required large observed co - moving volume needed for clustering measurements using these relatively small sky areas , 3d clustering measurements of x - ray",
    "selected agns have mainly been conducted at @xmath11 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "optically - selected agns at redshifts of @xmath12 appear to reside in somewhat lower host dmh masses ( @xmath13 m@xmath14 , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) than _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ selected agn samples ( @xmath15 m@xmath14 , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "possible explanations of the differences in the clustering signals include either the presence of a large fraction of x - ray absorbed narrow - line type ii agns in the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ samples or the different luminosities of the agn samples . at lower redshifts",
    "3d broad - line x - ray agn clustering measurements have been associated with large uncertainties , due to small sample sizes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    to achieve smaller uncertainties in agn clustering measurements , @xcite use the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) of agns with a tracer set of galaxies that contains a large number of objects .",
    "the agn acf is then inferred from the ccf , which has many more pairs at a given separation and hence significantly reduces the uncertainties in the spatial correlation function compared with the direct measurements of the agn acf .    in @xcite ( hereafter paper i )",
    "we use the cross - correlation technique to calculate the ccf between broad - line x - ray selected agns from the _ rosat _ all sky survey ( rass ) and sdss luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) in the redshift range @xmath16 .",
    "the potential of rass , which is currently the most sensitive x - ray all sky survey , can only be maximally exploited when it is combined with other large - area surveys such as sdss .",
    "the unprecedented low uncertainties of the inferred broad - line agn acf from the rass / sdss combination allows us to split our sample into subsamples according to their x - ray luminosities . from this work , for the first time , we report an x - ray luminosity dependence of broad - line agn clustering in that higher luminosity agns cluster more strongly than their lower luminosity counterparts .",
    "we conclude that low luminosity broad - line rass / sdss agns cluster similarly to blue galaxies at the same redshift , while high luminosity rass / sdss agns cluster similarly to red galaxies .    in our second paper ( @xcite ;",
    "hereafter paper ii ) , we apply a halo occupation distribution ( hod ) modeling technique to the agn - lrg ccf in order to move beyond determining the typical dmh mass based on the clustering signal strength and instead constrain the full distribution of agns as a function of dmh mass . to do this ,",
    "we develop a novel method of applying the hod model directly to the ccf .",
    "the hod modeling significantly improves the analysis of the ccf because it properly uses the fourier transformed linear power spectrum in the `` two halo term '' as well as the non - linear growth of matter in the `` one halo term '' through the formation and growth of dmhs .",
    "this results in significant improvements over the standard method , which is used in paper i , of fitting both regimes with a phenomenological power law .",
    "one of the important results of this analysis is that at @xmath16 the mean number of satellite agns in a dmh does not proportionally increase with halo mass , as is found for satellite galaxies .",
    "the agn fraction among satellite galaxies actually _ decreases _ with increasing dmh mass beyond @xmath17 @xmath18 m@xmath14 .",
    "in this paper we extend the scope of our previous papers to both somewhat lower and higher redshifts to obtain broad - line agn clustering results at @xmath7 , where very precise narrow - line agn clustering measurements exist but broad - line agn clustering is poorly constrained .",
    "this is crucial for studying the possible evolution and luminosity dependence of broad - line agn clustering from low to high redshifts .",
    "the dominant process that triggers agn activity could be a function of redshift and/or halo mass , which may be reflected in the clustering properties .",
    "we also study the clustering signal of both x - ray and optically - selected broad - line agn samples , and test whether the exclusion of radio - detected broad - line agns changes our results . as the same statistical method and galaxy tracer sets are used to infer the clustering signal for x - ray and optically - selected broad - line agns",
    ", we can explore differences in the clustering among the different selection techniques with low systematic uncertainties .",
    "furthermore , we derive bias parameters by applying the hod modeling directly to all ccfs . in paper ii",
    "we show that using power law fit results even in the non - linear regime , as is commonly done in the literature , is appropriate to detect difference in the clustering properties between different samples .",
    "however , the derived bias parameters and dmh masses based on these fits should be interpreted with caution as the fit does not only consider the linear regime ( two halo term ) , but also the non - linear regime ( one halo term ) .",
    "consequently , here we derive the bias for each agn sample using hod modeling of the ccf .",
    "full detailed results of the hod modeling of the ccfs presented in this paper will be given in a future paper ( miyaji et al . in preparation ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the properties of the different galaxy tracers sets used at different redshifts , while section 3 gives the details of our different agn samples . in section 4",
    "we briefly summarize the cross - correlation technique , how the agn acf is inferred from this , and present our results .",
    "we apply the hod modeling in section 5 .",
    "our results are discussed in section 6 and we conclude in section 7 . throughout the paper , all distances",
    "are measured in co - moving coordinates and given in units of @xmath18mpc , where @xmath19kms@xmath20mpc@xmath20 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "we use a cosmology of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , which is consistent with the @xmath24 data release 7 ( @xcite ; table  3 ) .",
    "the same cosmology is used in papers i & ii . luminosities and absolute magnitudes are calculated for @xmath25 .",
    "we use ab magnitudes throughout the paper .",
    "all uncertainties represent to a 1@xmath3 ( 68.3% ) confidence interval unless otherwise stated .",
    "the crucial ingredient in the cross - correlation method is the tracer set , a sample with a large number of objects that traces the underlying dark matter density distribution .",
    "the properties of the tracer set determines the redshift range over which the method can be applied .",
    "the agn samples of interest are necessarily limited to the same redshift range and geometry as the corresponding tracer set . as the rass / sdss selected agns ( @xcite ) are based on the sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ) , we consequently limit the tracer sets to the same survey geometry when we compute the clustering measurements of the x - ray selected agn . the sdss geometry and completeness are expressed in terms of spherical polygons ( @xcite ) .",
    "this file is not publicly - available for dr5 , therefore , we use the latest version available prior to dr5 : the dr4 + geometry file .",
    "however , optically - selected sdss agns ( @xcite ) make use of the full sdss survey ( dr7 ) .",
    "consequently , we consider tracer sets from the dr7 geometry whenever we compute ccfs of optically - selected sdss agns .    in the redshift range of @xmath26 we use sdss main galaxies for the tracer set , while sdss luminous red galaxies ( lrgs , @xcite ) are used for the corresponding cross - correlation sample at @xmath16 ( same as for paper i ) .",
    "very luminous red galaxies are used as a tracer set at @xmath27 .",
    "we will refer to the latter sample as the extended lrg sample. above @xmath28 the number of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in sdss decreases dramatically and does not allow the selection of further tracer sets with a sufficient density of objects . in the following subsections",
    "we describe in detail the extraction of the various tracer sets and how we account for sdss fiber collisions .      the sdss main galaxy sample ( @xcite )",
    "is drawn from the nyu value - added galaxy catalog ( nyu vagc , @xcite ; @xcite ) , based on the sdss dr7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the photometric data covers an area of 10417 deg@xmath10 , while the spectroscopic data covers 7966 deg@xmath10 .",
    "absolute magnitudes , based on petrosian fluxes , are @xmath29-corrected to @xmath30 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which is close to the median redshift of our sample .",
    "we follow a scheme similar to @xcite , who use the nyu vagc to measure the clustering of various luminosity and color - selected galaxy subsamples .",
    "similarly , we limit our sample to @xmath31 .",
    "the bright limit avoids incompleteness due to galaxy deblending , and the faint limit accounts for the slightly - varying @xmath32-band magnitude limit over the sdss area ( nominal value @xmath33 ) .",
    "the restriction of @xmath34 ensures a uniform flux limit throughout the whole sdss survey .",
    "in addition , we create a volume - limited galaxy sample by selecting objects with an absolute magnitude of @xmath35 .",
    "finally we limit the redshift range to @xmath36 .    applying the above - mentioned selection criteria and considering only sdss dr7 areas with a spectroscopic completeness ratio of @xmath370.8",
    ", we select 68273 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from the corresponding nyu vagc . the dr7 area covered by restricting the spectroscopic completeness ratio to @xmath370.8 is 7670 deg@xmath10 . the properties of this dr7 sdss main galaxy sample are summarized in table  [ samples ] .    as described above , the x - ray selected rass /",
    "sdss agn samples are based on dr5 .",
    "therefore , we further reconfigure the dr7 tracer sets ( in this case the sdss main galaxy sample ) to the dr4 + geometry to define a common survey geometry to use when measuring the clustering of x - ray selected agns . the restriction to",
    "the dr4 + survey area with a dr7 spectroscopic completeness ratio of @xmath370.8 corresponds to an area of 5468 deg@xmath10 .",
    "table  [ samples ] lists the properties of the dr4 + sdss main galaxy sample .",
    "an operational constraint of the sdss spectroscopic program is that two fibers can not be placed closer than 55 arcsec on a single plate .",
    "overlapping spectroscopic plates compensate partially for the effect .",
    "however , @xmath27% of the target galaxies can not be spectroscopically observed because of fiber collisions .",
    "this observational bias is corrected by assigning to each galaxy that has not been observed the redshift of their nearest neighbor with a spectroscopic sdss redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "although one might be concerned that this simple method could overcorrect and result in too many close galaxy pairs at the same redshift , which would then distort clustering measurements , @xcite demonstrate that this correction procedure works very well .",
    "they use @xmath38cdm @xmath39-body simulations and design three galaxy samples and measure the correlation function for three samples : i ) from the full simulated galaxy distribution , ii ) from simulated sdss data including fiber collision losses and not correcting for it , and iii ) from simulated sdss data that corrects for the fiber collision by assigning the redshift of their nearest spectroscopic neighbor .",
    "they verify that the differences between i ) and iii ) are much smaller than the statistical uncertainties down to scales of @xmath40 @xmath18 mpc , while ii ) underestimates the correlation function at scales @xmath41 @xmath18 mpc .",
    "therefore , we use the same fiber correction procedure for our main galaxy sample .",
    "the nyu vagc provides this information through an sdss fiber collision corrected galaxy sample .",

    "this is a compromise between the required computation time to calculate the correlation functions and having sufficient counts on the smallest scales to avoid introducing noise .",
    "more objects are required at higher redshift for a given sky area to account for the fact that with increasing redshift the same angular distance on the sky corresponds to larger physical co - moving separations .      in order to extend our clustering measurements to higher redshifts",

    "are caused by strong variations between the samples in the one halo term , while the variations in the two halo term are smaller .",
    "as described in the beginning of section  [ hod_model ] , power law fit bias measurements commonly use smaller scales that are in the one halo term ( our fitted range is @xmath271 @xmath18 mpc ) in order to increase the statistical significance .",

    "hod modeling allows , in principle , the use of the full range of scales since the method first determines the one and two halo terms and then constrains the linear using data down to the smallest @xmath178 values that are dominated by the two halo term for each individual sample .",
    "therefore , an apparently low power law bias value of one sample compared to another can be due to a lower clustering strength in the one halo term , while the `` true '' linear bias parameters may be similar .",

    "the differences in the clustering signals between x - ray and optically - selected agn samples at @xmath519 can potentially be accounted for either as the result of a large luminosity difference between the samples or the large fraction of x - ray absorbed , optically narrow - line agns in the x - ray agn samples .    to test the latter assumption , we measure the clustering properties of narrow - line rass / sdss agns classified by @xcite in the redshift ranges of @xmath26 and @xmath16 . the low number density of narrow - line rass / sdss agns at @xmath16 forces us to use scales of @xmath520 @xmath18 mpc to apply the @xmath189-statistics during the hod modeling .",

    "two important points are worth noting : first , as _ rosat _ can detect only moderately x - ray absorbed agns ( log @xmath522)\\la 22 $ ] ) , while _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ are sensitive to much more absorbed ( and lower luminosity ) agns , the narrow - line agns detected by rass may not be as common .",
    "second , the relative clustering strength of narrow - line agns could change with redshift if there is a difference in how agn activity is triggered at different cosmological epochs . however , other studies confirm that low - redshift narrow - line ( radio - quiet ) agns are not strongly clustered and are hosted in galaxies that do not differ significantly from typical non - agn galaxies.(e.g , @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "the fact that they find a difference in the clustering of radio - detected versus non - detected agns and we do not may be a consequence of the samples having different luminosities or redshifts .    if broad - line agns at @xmath7 indeed have no clustering dependence on radio emission , this may suggest that different physical mechanisms trigger radio emission in broad - line and narrow - line agns , as narrow - line agns do have a clustering dependence with radio emission ( @xcite ) at fixed stellar mass",
    ". this would be somewhat surprising as significant radio emission in all agns is believed to be related to jet phenomena ( e.g. , @xcite ) .      in papers",
    "i and ii , we reported a possible x - ray luminosity - dependence in the agn clustering strength of rass / sdss agn in the redshift range @xmath16 ( see also fig .",
    "[ xray_optical_b_hod ] , green and yellow green symbols ) .",
    "the exclusion of radio - detected rass / sdss agns performed here tests whether the weak @xmath59-dependence of agn clustering observed is due to the presence of radio - loud agns in the higher @xmath59 sample ( see sect .",
    "[ radio_rass ] ) .    as shown in paper ii",
    ", this luminosity - dependent clustering is more significant in the one halo term than in the two halo term .",
    "using only larger scales of @xmath542 @xmath18 mpc for the hod modeling in this paper ( in order to derive bias parameter in a consistent way for all agn samples ) increases the error on the individual measurements .",
    "this results in a decrease in the significance of the luminosity - dependent clustering .",
    "we find that the 1.5@xmath3 ( 2.0@xmath3 using the power law bias of this paper ) clustering difference between the lower and higher @xmath59 agn samples remains roughly constant when we exclude radio - detect agns from both subsamples ( 1.7@xmath3 using the hod bias ; 2.4@xmath3 using the power law bias of this paper ) .",
    "the difference in the clustering strength of the lower and higher @xmath59 rass / sdss agn samples in the redshift range of @xmath26 is 1.2@xmath3 ( hod model ) .",
    "the error bars on the bias of these samples are high , due to the low number of objects .",
    "the significance of the individual redshift measurements do not provide strong evidence for an x - ray luminosity dependence of the agn clustering strength .",

    "[ lowz_b ] ) . @xcite compute the clustering signal for _",
    "swift_/bat 1555 kev selected agns and find a clustering difference of 1.6@xmath3 for the higher @xmath59 agns",
    "relative to the lower @xmath59 agns . comparing",
    "the photometric galaxy density around spectroscopic sdss agns , @xcite and @xcite find that higher luminosity agns have more overdense galaxy environments compared to lower luminosity agns at scales smaller than 0.5 mpc .",
    "these studies are not directly measuring agn clustering , rather they focus on the immediate environments of agns .",
    "we do not detect an optical luminosity - dependence of the rass / sdss agn clustering . given the large sample size and low resulting errors in these samples ,",
    "this is a constraining result .",
    "previous clustering measurements of optically - selected agns using the 2df qso redshift survey ( 2qz , @xcite ) , 2df - sdss lrg and qso ( 2slaq , @xcite ) , and sdss also find little evidence for an optical luminosity dependence of the agn clustering strength ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "use ccfs between agns and lrgs and find some indication that bright sdss agns cluster less than faint 2slaq qsos , although the result is only marginally significant ( 1.6@xmath3 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite detect a stronger clustering strength for the 10% most luminous sdss dr5 agns ( @xmath543 ) at the @xmath22@xmath3 level .",
    "however , they caution that the dynamical range in luminosity probed is narrow and the sample size in the luminosity subsamples not large enough to yield constraining clustering measurements .",
    "@xcite suggest that a luminosity dependence of the clustering may be more evident at @xmath544 , while @xcite find hints that the lower redshift ranges ( @xmath545 ) may show more dependence with luminosity .",
    "the optical and x - ray luminosities of broad - line agns are connected via the optical  to  x - ray spectral index , which measures the ratio of the rest - frame luminosity density at 2500   to 2 kev .",
    "although the relation has some scatter ( see @xcite for the optical  to  x - ray spectral index for rass / sdss agns ) , more x - ray luminous agns are , on average , also intrinsically brighter in the optical .",
    "if indeed there is a weak x - ray luminosity dependence of the agn clustering strength , the very narrow @xmath107 range that the optical sdss agns span would hamper a detection . identifying agn activity using x - ray emission allows us to identify low - luminosity agns , where the optical light is dominated by the host galaxy .",
    "this results in a wider luminosity range in x - ray emission than in the optical ( fig .",
    "[ o_sdss_radio_x - ray ] , lower panel ) in the two lowest redshift ranges . at @xmath45 ,",
    "the mean optical luminosity of the high @xmath107 sdss agn sample is only a factor 2 higher ( 0.75 mag ) than the low @xmath107 sdss agn sample , while the x - ray luminosities between the high and low @xmath59 samples differ by a factor of 4.4 .",
    "this is also seen when considering the luminosity difference between the 90th percentile in the high luminosity samples and the 10th percentile in the low luminosity samples ( factor @xmath546 for optical sdss agns , @xmath547 for rass / sdss agns ) and covered luminosity range ( @xmath548 for optical sdss agns , @xmath549 for rass / sdss agns ) .    hence , to detect a possible optical luminosity dependence in the broad - line agn clustering strength ,",
    "as might be expected if there is a weak x - ray luminosity dependence , considering the optical  to  x - ray luminosity relation , a wider optical luminosity range has to be tested .",
    "as these samples already include the brightest objects , this is only possible if one can include lower optical luminosities where broad - line agns are not effectively selected due to an increase in the host galaxy starlight fraction .",
    "only much deeper surveys at larger redshifts may yield the dynamical range to test the luminosity dependence for optically selected broad - line agns .",
    "the possible x - ray luminosity dependence of broad - line agn clustering detected at low redshifts ( in that more x - ray luminous agns are more clustered than less x - ray luminous agns ) may be difficult to reconcile with the result that , on average , low luminosity ( mainly narrow - line ) x - ray selected agns at higher redshifts are more clustered than luminous optically - selected broad - line agns ( see fig .  [ xray_optical_b ] ) . if the x - ray luminosity dependence is real , this may suggest that different physical processes trigger agn activity at different cosmological times or at different luminosities .",
    "although agn clustering measurements are currently not as constraining and the interpretation of the results is not as clear as for galaxy clustering measurements , some general findings have emerged in the last few years .    at low redshifts ( @xmath550 ) , broad and narrow - line agn cluster similarly to inactive galaxies , occupying dmh masses of log @xmath1 ) \\sim 12.0 - 13.5",
    "this dmh mass range includes cases where the dmh is dominated by one @xmath551@xmath516 galaxy or a small galaxy group composed of multiple such galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "independent of the selection method , the clustering strength of broad - line agns does not significantly change , while narrow - line agns show a significant increase in the clustering amplitude when radio - selected narrow - line agns are studied",
    ". finally , more x - ray luminous broad - line agns may cluster more strongly than their lower luminosity counterparts . although the various agn samples have different luminosities , radio - loud , optically - selected narrow - line agns , very luminous x - ray agns , and red galaxies reside in somewhat similar high dmh masses .",
    "lower luminosity x - ray agns , optical narrow - line agns with no radio emission , and blue galaxies tend to be found in lower dmh masses .    at high redshifts ( @xmath552 ) , x - ray",
    "selected agn samples appear to cluster more strongly than optically - selected agns .",
    "the reason for this remains unclear .",
    "possibly either low - luminosity or narrow - line ( x - ray absorbed ) agns cluster more strongly than very luminous broad - line optical agns . additionally ,",
    "as some of the x - ray clustering studies significantly underestimate their systematic uncertainties it may turn out that these measurements are consistent with optical agn clustering measurements .",
    "more high - z agn clustering measurements based on larger samples are needed to gain a clearer picture .",
    "in this paper we use agn samples based on sdss . in the very near future",
    "there is not another planned survey that includes photometry and a dedicated extensive spectroscopic follow - up program for agns over such large areas as that covered by sdss . as both large co - moving volumes and spectroscopic redshifts are essential for precise agn clustering measurements , major improvement in our x - ray and optically - selected low redshift agns are therefore not expected in the very near future .",
    "boss ( @xcite ) and bigboss ( @xcite ) will detect high redshift agns at @xmath553 , which will improve agn clustering measurements at higher redshifts .    in the coming years ,",
    "the _ rosat _ successor _ erosita _ ( @xcite ) will perform an all - sky survey in the hard and soft x - rays , probing much fainter than rass , which is expected to detect up to @xmath23 million agns .",
    "additionally , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst , @xcite ) is expected to identify @xmath22 million agns in optical bands .",
    "_ erosita _ and lsst have the potential to significantly improve agn clustering measurements at low and high redshifts , though only if there are dedicated large spectroscopic follow - up programs .",
    "this work presents agn clustering measurements at low redshifts in three independent redshift ranges : @xmath26 , @xmath16 , and @xmath27 . extending the use of the cross - correlation method of @xcite",
    ", we infer the auto - correlation for both _",

    "sdss luminous red galaxies , and very luminous red galaxies ( extended lrg sample ) .",
    "we apply the hod model method ( @xcite ) directly to the measured ccfs to derive the bias parameter .",
    "we study the impact of different agn selections on the clustering signal of broad - line agns , i.e. , by excluding radio - detected agns .",
    "furthermore , we compute the clustering strength for rass - selected narrow - line agns .",
    "we find no statistically convincing difference in the clustering of x - ray and optically - selected broad - line sdss agns at low redshifts ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "different agn selections based on either x - ray ( rass ) , optical ( sdss ) , or radio ( first ) , and combinations of these , do not significantly change the clustering signal for broad - line agns .",
    "this appears to be in contrast to other studies that find stronger clustering for radio - loud agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , those results are based on narrow - line , low luminosity agns , while our sample consists of more luminous broad - line agns . for the x - ray selected broad - line rass / sdss agns",

    "we measure the clustering of rass selected narrow - line agns , which consists of a mix of nls1s , seyfert 1.5 , 1.8 , 1.9 , and seyfert 2 candidates .",
    "we do not find a significantly lower clustering amplitude of rass narrow - line agns compared to broad - line agns , although these measurements are subject to large uncertainties .",
    "in addition , we rule out that rass narrow - line agns cluster significantly more strongly than broad - line agns at low redshifts .",
    "we show that the exclusion of radio - detected rass / sdss agns in @xmath16 does not change the weak x - ray luminosity dependence of the agn clustering strength that we find in paper i ( in that higher @xmath59 agns cluster more strongly than lower @xmath59 agns at @xmath554 ) .",
    "we do not detect an optical luminosity dependence of the broad - line agn clustering in the same redshift range , though this result is not particularly constraining due to the narrow @xmath107 range that is covered .",
    "we derive the bias parameter based on the best power law fit , the standard method used in literature , as well as by using hod modeling .",
    "important differences between the two techniques are found for some agn samples . in particular , using a power law fit can underestimate the bias compared to hod modeling .",
    "we show that hod model bias parameters are more reliable and more accurately reflect the large - scale clustering strength .",
    "larger agn samples will be provided by future missions such as _ erosita_. as these samples will have lower statistical uncertainties , hod model bias parameters should be used to avoid introducting systematic errors that could exceed the statistical errors and thus possibly lead to a misinterpretation of clustering measurements .",
