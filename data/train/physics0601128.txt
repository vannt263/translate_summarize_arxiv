    "a protein mapping onto a contact network clearly introduces constraints on the network topological properties .",

    "second , size and steric considerations introduce a more relevant constraint in the topology of amino acid networks , for example , limiting the possible values for the degree @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the degree dependence must be characterized by a limiting finite value for the maximum degree @xmath15 , irrespective of the chain size .",
    "this can be observed for our data sets in the inset of figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the hitting of the maximum degree of a vertex can be translated as performance of how to connect vertices in the folding process .",

    "as explicitly demonstrated for six proteins , highly connected residues in the native state may not correspond to the highly connected ones ( key residues ) in the transition states .",
    "protein structure is sequence dependent .",
    "thus , different of other real network models , where vertices are in general considered to be of the same type we are dealing with systems , which result from the intrinsic properties of the amino acid residues .    to obtain a deeper insight of the role played by each residue in forming native conformations ,",
    "we investigate how to relate their character to the ability of making contacts with other residues . for this end",

    "[ fig:3 ] the average connectivity for each residue one - letter code from all 160 structures , taking into account the number of times each residue appears in all sequences .",
    "the sequence of amino acid residues displayed in figure  [ fig:3 ] was chosen because it groups their characteristics : aliphatic non - hydrogen - bonding ( gly , ala , pro , val , ile , leu ) , aromatic non - hydrogen - bonding ( phe ) , sulfur containing ( met , cys ) and hydrogen - bonding ( trp , tyr , his , thr , ser , gln , asn , glu , asp , lys , arg )  @xcite .     *",
    "( a ) *   * ( b ) *    figure  [ fig:3]a shows a clear trend for lower average connectivity played by amino acid residues in proteins classified in all-@xmath0 structural class .",
    "nevertheless , the highest average connectivity is presented by residues in the @xmath29 protein class .",
    "this class has mixed @xmath0-helices and parallel @xmath5-strands .",
    "intermediary pattern of connectivity is found for residues in all-@xmath5 and @xmath6 protein classes with predominant higher connectivity for the @xmath5 class .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the higher average connectivity for the residues in @xmath29 class also comes from interactions among residues in different secondary structures .",
    "the @xmath6 class presents regions of @xmath0-helices and anti - parallel @xmath5-strands largely segregated along the chain .",
    "we also conclude that the connectivity in this protein class results mainly from contacts among the elements in each secondary structure type .",
    "figure  [ fig:3]b shows the average connectivity of each residue calculated from all networks considered in our data set , stressing their general ability of making network contacts .",
    "can we relate this ability to any intrinsic amino acid property ? in the following , we argue that those sharp evaluated average values can be understood in terms of the concept of hydrophobicity .",
    "we recall that the hydrophobic effect concept as the leading force in folding globular proteins comes from experimental evidences .",
    "this is illustrated by the finding of mostly non - polar residues in the core of protein structures  @xcite as a consequence of avoiding the exposure to water of amino acids with hydrophobic side chains .",
    "therefore , the hydrophobic / hydrophilic character of amino acids has been viewed as an important issue in understanding the formation of native structures .",
    "for example , the spatial distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues has led to the definition of score functions based on hydrophobic profiles as a mean to detect native protein folding among many decoy structures  @xcite .    in spite of many scales ranking the hydrophobic character , due mainly to the particular measurement method",
    ", there is a consensus about the more hydrophobic ( phe , ile , leu , val ) and more hydrophilic ( lys , arg , asp , glu ) residues .",
    "therefore , one expects to obtain more ( less ) connected vertices as the ones ranked in the top ( bottom ) of the hydrophobic scales .    to investigate how the average network connectivity ( shown in figure  [ fig:3]b ) is related to the hydrophobic character of residues , we have checked its correlation with the 127 scales collected in ref .",
    "the most significant correlations are observed with the well known scales in the literature : kyte and doolittle , juretic _",
    "et al . _ and janin-2 , all presenting correlation coefficient @xmath30 ; taylor and thornton ( @xmath31 ) and sereda _ et al._-2 ( @xmath32 ) , following the notation for these scales as in table i of ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "non - significant correlations are obtained with the scales : hopp ( @xmath33 ) ; wilce _ et al._-3 ( @xmath34 ) ; michel _ et al .",
    "_ , colonna - cesari and sander ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "although we can find a very good agreement between the amino acid hydrophobic caracter and its average connectivity , figure  [ fig:3](a ) clearly shows that this quantitative character is related to the secondary structure contents .",
    "yet , this has experimental consequences on the definition of the free energy transfer .",
    "therefore , any method used to predict elements of secondary structure based on typical hydrophobicity profiles need to be reconsidered .",
    "those quantitative values are expected to be correlated to the exposure pattern of the amino acids to the aqueous environment .",
    "this can be readly investigated considering only the average connectivity and the available data on individual amino acid accesible surface area ( independent of its location in a peptide ) .",
    "our results show that the average connectivity reveals a weak correlation with the average buried accessible surface area ( asa ) @xmath36 ( @xmath37 )  @xcite , where @xmath38 is asa calculation based on gly - x - gly models related to the unfolded state and @xmath39 is an average asa calculated from native protein structures .",
    "however , the correlation coefficient increases to 0.90 for the _ fraction _ of buried asa @xmath40 , which reflects the relative loss of their accessible surface areas during the folding process .",
    "so far we have focused the discussion from a single vertex point of viewing .",
    "however , many real - world networks also exhibit degree correlations  @xcite , i.e. , the conditional probability @xmath41 that an edge leaving from a vertex , with degree @xmath26 , and arriving at a vertex , with degree @xmath42 , is dependent on @xmath26 .",
    "this two - vertices correlation is expressed by @xmath43 and furnishes the average connectivity of the nearest neighbors of vertices with connectivity @xmath26  @xcite . concerning this aspect ,",
    "the networks are classified as to show assortative mixing , if the degree correlation is positive , a preference for high - degree vertices to attach to other high - degree vertices , or disassortative mixing , otherwise .",
    "therefore , whenever @xmath44 increases with @xmath26 , one obtains a correlated network , thus showing an assortative mixing . on the other hand , a decreasing behavior as a function of @xmath26 shows a disassortative mixing .",
    "our numerical analysis of the two - vertices correlation shows that the dependency of @xmath44 on the degree @xmath26 can be described by a linear relation for all our networks ( data not shown ) , @xmath45 , with @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , this result leads to the average of @xmath44 over all vertices , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the observed degree distribution of each network , to have also a linear behavior as a function of @xmath9 because @xmath49 .",
    "we depict in figure  [ fig:4 ] the behavior of @xmath50 as a function of @xmath8 and of the structural classes .",
    "we observe again a stationary value for large @xmath8 , reflecting what we can call the main property of amino acid residue network .",
    "in fact , that homogeneous network behavior ( @xmath51 ) is supported by the inset of figure  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "the linear regression for the 160 proteins leads to @xmath52 , with correlation coefficient @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , there is a strict correspondence , exhibited by the above equation , between the way @xmath50 and the average degree @xmath9 grow with @xmath8 . as a matter of fact , this can also be noted _ a posteriori _ by the similarity between the positions of the data points in figures  [ fig:2 ] and  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "this reveals a specific pattern of attachments among vertices for all network sizes , and it is further explored below .     over all vertices of degree @xmath26 , @xmath50 , as a function of the network size @xmath8 for the structural classes : all-@xmath0 ( @xmath12 ) , all-@xmath5 ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath6 ( + ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "* inset : * @xmath50 as a function of the average connectivity @xmath9 for all structural classes . ]",
    "we recall that , although we observe a linear increasing of @xmath44 with @xmath26 , this behavior is only valid up to @xmath54 due to physical constraints of the networks .",
    "so far , we have reinforced the observed process toward some high - connected vertices as the final result of the protein folding within its biological time .",
    "however protein folding corresponds to a specific mechanism of wiring in contrast to the collapse of homopolymers , likely due to the key residues in according to the nucleation - condensation model as a highly cooperative process  @xcite .    to explore further the role played by the connectivity of residues leading to the assortative mixing behavior",
    "we re - define our networks as being composed of two types of residues , denoted by @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath55 residues are chosen as the more connected ones in figure  [ fig:3]b and @xmath56 residues otherwise , in such way to obtain two data sets of 11 and 9 residues , roughly corresponding to the three more correlated scales we have identified in sec .  [",
    "sec : one_vertex ] .",
    "this makes a set for @xmath55 type residues including thr as being the lowest hydrophobic and another one for @xmath56 type residues starting with ser . differently from bipartite networks , where edges connect only vertices of unlike type ,",
    "our new networks have edges connecting vertices irrespective of their type .",
    "now , to proceed the investigation on how the assortativity arises in native structures we apply the ideas of community forming by newman  @xcite . in this sense , we search a better comprehension of the assortativity as consequence of a mechanism for network formation , which results from preferential attachments among specific residues .",
    "firstly , we quantify the observed assortative mixing calculating the fraction of edges @xmath57 between vertices of type @xmath11 and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "table i presents the averaged values with their standard deviations for the fraction of edges in each structural class and the final averages from all data , with @xmath60 .",
    "it is clear the preference for attachments between @xmath61 and @xmath62 vertices .",
    "secondly , we calculate the assortativity coefficient  @xcite @xmath63 , a correlation coefficient which lies in the range @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "this coefficient hits the value 1 for perfect assortative mixing , i.e. when every edge connects vertices of the same type , and the minimum value 0 for a random mixing .",
    "the low numerical values for @xmath63 in table i taking into account their standard deviations confirms that there is almost no assortative mixing by type , i.e. @xmath61 and @xmath65 attachments .",
    "hence , the network surrounding residue of type @xmath55 is likely to be another @xmath55 or @xmath56 , with probabilities presented in table i. we may interpret those sharp probabilities as the result of a compositional equilibrium of @xmath55 and @xmath56 residues in globular proteins . with our hydrophobic scale",
    "defined in terms of @xmath9 we calculate how dominant the presence of @xmath55 residues is . for all-@xmath0 class",
    "we obtain @xmath66 ; all-@xmath5 , @xmath67 ; @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath29 , @xmath70",
    ".    although the tendency of @xmath55 residues to connect among themselves and with @xmath56 residues is a well known fact , this approach presents a manner to quantify the preferential attachment associated to globular proteins .",
    "furthermore , the tuning of energy couplings in minimal model simulations may profit from this residue attachment quantification in order to be more realistic in describing the folding process .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     from a graph point of view , attachment probabilities reveal the wiring diagram when including different kinds of vertices as a mechanism for network formation .",
    "those probabilities also discard the simple picture of a predominant hydrophobic core .",
    "our results help to form the image that an @xmath55 vertex brings along other @xmath55 vertices as well as other @xmath56 vertices in forming the native structure .",
    "table i also shows the fraction of edges @xmath57 for all classes as a function of three typical ranges of protein sizes @xmath8 .",
    "it is interesting to note that when one restricts the analysis for chain sizes in those ranges , the fractions @xmath57 in each range are still comparable within the standard deviations .",
    "this confirms the robust pattern of network formation irrespective of their size .",
    "to support the above specific attachment among @xmath71 residues , we have evaluated the clustering coefficient @xmath72 over all vertices . while the average connectivity gives information on how connected a vertex is , the clustering coefficient shows the network transitivity , i.e. , the probability that two nearest neighbors of a given vertex are nearest neighbors themselves  @xcite , forming a triangle with this vertex .",
    "notice that , in this aspect , the clustering coefficient is a measure of three - vertices correlation .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath72 is 1 in a fully connected network , it assumes the value @xmath73 for a random network and it is constant for regular lattices  @xcite .",
    "our results for @xmath72 as a function of @xmath8 for the structural classes exclude any random character in its formation ( see figure  [ fig:5 ] ) as already pointed out  @xcite without including any size dependence analysis .    .",
    "]    next , we look at the distribution of inter - residue contacts from a network perspective .",
    "however , since the main results of this distribution are already known in the literature , we have left them to the appendix .",
    "we include this appendix to show that network modelling distinguishes molecular chains with secondary structures from polymers and to present a comprehensive study of the topological properties of globular proteins .",
    "different from the usual network analysis dedicated to study the properties of a single system , we try to infer the main topological features of a class of systems ( globular proteins ) characterized by an unknown mechanism which drive them to specific tridimensional configurations , the native structures .",
    "topological parameters have been obtained to characterize native structures and their organization pattern as a result of the underlying dynamical process of formation .",
    "our main results permit the following theoretical conclusions : ( i ) the average number of edges leaving a given center of force presents a direct relation with the hydrophobic character of the residues and to their fraction of buried accessible surface area ; ( ii ) the way this average number of edges ( center of forces ) grows with the protein chain size is also reproduced in the formation of inter - residue interactions among the nearest neighbors of that center of force ; ( iii ) the interactions among specific residues exhibit a well defined pattern described by the results presented in table i. the above patterns remain , irrespective of the protein size , and this may shed light on the protein evolution .",

    "there is still another important aspect to be considered : the attachments distribution in our networks compared to a full connected one , as driven by bonded and non - bonded forces from inter - residue interactions .",
    "this can be translated as a topological pattern of inter - residue contacts categorized into short- , medium- and long - range interactions .",
    "short - range interaction contributions correspond to residues within a distance of two residues from each other , medium range to the ones within a distance of 3 or 4 residues and long - range contribution is defined to come from more than 4 residues away  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:6 ] presents the average relative number of observed inter - residue contacts as a function of its sequence separation @xmath74 between residues @xmath11 and @xmath58 along the main chain .",
    "it is defined as the ratio of the observed number of contacts at distance @xmath74 and its maximum number for the full connected network , i.e. with @xmath75 edges .",
    "this figure shows that the main contribution comes from the first four neighbors , i.e. , from short- and medium - range contacts , reflecting the chain connectivity property .",
    "in particular , for all-@xmath0 chains , we see that from all possible contacts at distance 1 , only 90.2% occur ; at distance 2 , 43.9% ; at distance 3 , 60.6% ; at distance 4 , 52.2% ; dropping to 11.8% and 7.7% at distances 5 and 6 , respectively . comparing all classes , the short - range contacts present similar relative numbers .",
    "large relative number ( but less than 1 ) of contacts at distance 1 means that the chain connectivity between successive residues @xmath76 is not always enforced due to our definition of cutoff distance @xmath2 among side chain center of mass .",
    "we observe a preference for medium - range contacts by all-@xmath0 structures and a very low preference by all-@xmath5 .",
    "the highest relative number of contacts for all-@xmath0 at distance 3 reveals the pattern of helices characterized by the @xmath78 contacts .",
    "classes @xmath68 and @xmath29 present similar average relative number of observed inter - residue contacts .",
    "it is clear the preference of long - range contacts for all-@xmath5 structures , mainly compared with all-@xmath0 structures .",
    "this overall behavior reveals how vertices related to secondary structures interact in a network of amino acids as a function of the sequence separation ."
