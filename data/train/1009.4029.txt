    "the structure of the @xmath0be nucleus has been considered as a prototype of cluster structure in nuclei .",
    "it has been described theoretically by many different cluster models and several experiments have been performed in order to understand its structure and decay mechanisms .",
    "much effort has been devoted to the @xmath7 state due to its astrophysical importance in the formation of @xmath0be , @xmath8c and heavier elements in stellar nucleosynthesis@xcite . @xmath0be and @xmath0b are mirror nuclei that decay into @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "therefore their structures are expected to be very similar .",
    "we present here the results of two - dimensional energy correlations after the three - body decay of several @xmath0be resonances .",
    "moreover the same kind of results for the @xmath7-resonance of @xmath0b are shown in order to show the similarities .",
    "we employ here the complex - scaled hyperspherical adiabatic expansion method to solve the faddeev equations which describe our three - body system@xcite .",
    "the angular part of the hamiltonian is first solved keeping fixed the value of the hyperradius @xmath11 .",
    "its eigenvalues serve as effective potentials while the eigenfunctions , @xmath12 are used as a basis to expand the total wave - function @xmath13 the @xmath11-dependent expansion coefficients , @xmath14 , are the hyperradial wave functions obtained from the coupled set of hyperradial equations@xcite .",
    "we consider a two - body interaction able to reproduce the low - energy scattering properties of the two different pairs of particles in our three - body system .",
    "ali - bodmer @xmath15 potential@xcite and coulomb potential between @xmath1-particles are considered .",
    "the @xmath1-nucleon interaction is taken from cobis et al@xcite .",
    "the @xmath16be- and @xmath0b - resonances are of three - body character at large - distances , where they decay into two @xmath1-particles and one neutron or proton , but this is not necessarily the case at short - distances.@xcite we use the three - body model at all distances because the decay properties only require the proper description of the emerging three particles .",
    "a three - body short - range potential of the form @xmath17 is included to adjust the corresponding small - distance part of the effective potential .",
    "the correct resonance energies , which are all - decisive for decay details as evident in the probability for tunneling through a barrier , are then correctly reproduced .",
    "the eigenvalues of the angular hamiltonian for fixed hyperradius , serve as adiabatic potentials@xcite .",
    "each of them correspond to a specific combination of quantum numbers , i.e. , partial - wave momenta between two particles in each jacobi system .",
    "usually few angular eigenvalues are needed for achieving convergence . at small distances",
    "the potentials have wells that support the bound states and resonances .",
    "the energy distribution is the probability for finding a given particle at a given energy . it can be measured experimentally and is the only information that allows us to study the decay path . from the theoretical point of view , this information is contained in the large - distance part of the wave function , which must therefore be computed accurately .",
    "the zeldovic regularized fourier transform of the wave function gives the energy distributions@xcite .",
    "the resonance wave functions change sometimes substantially from small to large distances .",
    "this dynamic evolution allows a better understanding of the decays details@xcite .",
    "the decay mechanisms depend on the resonance properties and can be either sequential or direct or a mixture . in our case ,",
    "all of the resonances can decay sequentially via @xmath18be(@xmath19 ) , i.e. it is allowed by angular momentum conservation .",
    "one of the adiabatic components is related to the @xmath18be+@xmath2 structure and approaches the complex energy of the @xmath18be(@xmath19 ) resonance .",
    "this component will give the sequential contribution@xcite .      fig .",
    "[ fig9be ] corresponds to the two - dimensional energy correlations ( or dalitz plots ) of the three fragments of @xmath0be after the decay .",
    "the two possibilities , @xmath20 and @xmath15 , are shown and the @xmath21 of each state is labeled in the figure .",
    "the energies are given in units of their maximum values for each case , i.e. @xmath22 for the @xmath1-particles and @xmath23 for the neutrons .",
    "in all the cases we have removed the sequential decay via @xmath18be(@xmath19 ) .",
    "it is important to remark that the results are directly comparable to measured distributions .",
    "the first thing that we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig9be ] is that all the plots are symmetric between @xmath1 s energies .",
    "this symmetry is necessary since the @xmath1 s are identical particles .",
    "the graphs corresponding to @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are very similar to each other .",
    "first , we do not observe zeroes in the dalitz plots.@xcite this means that angular momentum conservation does not forbid any energy combination .",
    "second , we see that the density increases towards higher @xmath1 energies . this is due to the coulomb repulsion , which enlarges the charged particles energies while reduces that of the neutron .",
    "the other two cases show more structure and have zero probability points or curves .      in our description the only difference between @xmath0be and @xmath0b",
    "is the existing coulomb interaction between the @xmath1-particle and the proton in @xmath0b .",
    "the structure of the resonances in both nuclei are expected to be very similar .",
    "[ fig9b ] shows the comparison between the dalitz plots corresponding to the @xmath7-resonance of @xmath0be and @xmath0b .",
    "the patterns are , in fact , almost indistinguishable .",
    "we have described @xmath0be and @xmath0b resonances as three clusters by means of the complex - scaled hyperspherical adiabatic expansion method , including short - range and coulomb interactions .",
    "the two - dimensional energy correlations of the decaying fragments are shown for the low - lying resonances of @xmath0be .",
    "we compare one of them ( @xmath7 ) to the corresponding one in @xmath0b and find , as we expected , an almost identical distribution .",
    "our distributions are open to experimental tests .",
