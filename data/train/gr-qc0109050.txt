    "one of the manifestation of quantum gravity is a spacetime foam introduced by wheeler @xcite for the description a hypothesized topology fluctuations on the planck scale level .",
    "the spacetime foam is a cloud of appearing / disappearing quantum handles .",
    "the appearance / desctruction of these handles leads to the change of spacetime topology .",
    "this fact give rise to big difficulties at the description of the spacetime foam since by topology changes of a space ( according to morse theory @xcite ( part2 , chap .",
    "2 , sec . 10 ) ) the critical points must exist where the time direction is not defined . in each such point",
    "should be a singularity which is an obstacle for the mathematical description of the spacetime foam .",
    "nevertheless we can try to describe spacetime foam by some approximate manner . for the beginning",
    "we offer a model of the single quantum handle as the wormhole - like solution in the kaluza - klein gravity . in some approximation",
    "we can neglect the linear sizes of the handle and in this case each quantum handle looks as two points pasted together .",
    "it is so called a minimalist wormhole @xcite , _ i.e. _ quantum wormhole in which the cross section of the throat is contracted to a point . afterwards",
    "we will introduce an operator which describes the creation / annihilation of the minimalist wormhole .",
    "we will show that this operator can be presented as a grassman number and some ( scalar or fermion ) field .",
    "it is interesting to compare the model of spacetime foam presented here with another approaches in this field .",
    "now we would like briefly to circumscribe these approaches in the investigations of spacetime foam ( for details see review @xcite ) .",
    "the spacetime foam and the complicated topological structure connected with it may provide a mechanism for explaining the vanishing of the cosmological constant and for fixing all the constants of nature @xcite .",
    "the spacetime foam may also induce loss of a quantum coherence @xcite , and produce a frequency - dependent energy shifts that would slightly alter the dispersion relations for the different low - energy fields @xcite .",
    "also spacetime foam has been proposed as a mechanism for regulating both the ultraviolet @xcite and the infrared behavior of quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the most of these investigations based on the properties of a single or @xmath0 wormholes forming spacetime foam . here in the presented model we shall try to describe some effects connected to foam not being interested their internal structure .",
    "the difference between this model and above - mentioned approaches is similar to difference between thermodynamics and classical mechanics .",
    "the classical mechanics investigates the movement of each single particle in a gas whereas the thermodynamics works with physical quantities which are the average values of microscopical quantities . in the offered model of spacetime foam",
    "we are interesting only for cooperative properties of the foam that allows us to introduce some effective field which describes approximately and effectively spacetime foam .",
    "one mouth of quantum wormhole can entrap the electric force lines and then these force lines will emerge from another mouth .",
    "it allows us to consider each quantum wormhole as an electric dipole and the spacetime foam as a dielectric @xcite . in this case",
    "a big electric field can polarize the spacetime foam that can be the reason for some physical effects .",
    "the model of the individual quantum handle is presented on the fig.([fig1 ] ) .",
    "it is some realization of the wheeler idea about a wormhole entrapping electric force lines . in ref.@xcite",
    "he wrote : `` along with the fluctuations in the metric there occur fluctuations in the electromagnetic field . in consequence",
    "the typical multiply connected space @xmath1 has a net flux of electric lines of force passing through the `` wormhole '' .",
    "these lines are trapped by the topology of the space .",
    "these lines give the appearance of a positive charge at one end of the wormhole and a negative charge at the other '' .",
    "the composite wormhole on the fig.([fig1 ] ) consists from two reissner - nordstrm black holes and the 5d throat inserted between them @xcite .",
    "the 5d metric for this throat is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the 5@xmath4 extra coordinate ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 are some constants .",
    "we assume that in some rough approximation the quantum handle in the spacetime foam can be presented by this manner .",
    "the 5d einstein equations for the throat are @xmath7 it can be shown @xcite that there is three type of solutions : the first type ( wormhole - like solution ) is presented on fig.([fig1 ] ) with @xmath8 ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 are kaluza - klein electric and magnetic fields ) , the second one is an infinite flux tube with @xmath11 and the third one is a singular solution ( finite flux tube ) with @xmath12 . the longitudinal size @xmath13 of the wh - like solution depends on the relation between electric and magnetic fields : if @xmath14 then @xmath15 .",
    "now we will describe some properties of the wormhole - like solutions allowing us to interpret their as quantum handles in spacetime foam .",
    "let us define an approximate solution close to points @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 ) .",
    "@xmath18 with @xmath19 here @xmath20 , @xmath21 is some constant .",
    "it is easy to show that at the hypersurfaces @xmath22 : @xmath23 . on these hypersurfaces",
    "the change of the metric signature takes place : @xmath24 by @xmath25 and @xmath26 by @xmath27 . following to bronnikov @xcite we call these two hypersurfaces as @xmath28horizons .    for the definition of a kaluza - klein electric field we consider eq.([ind1b ] )",
    "@xmath29 ' = 0   \\label{ind1q}\\ ] ] here @xmath30 is the area of @xmath31 sphere . comparing with the gauss law",
    "we see that kaluza - klein electric field @xmath32 can be defined as follows @xmath33 here @xmath21 is an electric charge which is proportional to a flux of electric field . in this case",
    "the force lines of the electric field are uninterrupted and can be continued through the surfaces of matching the 5d wh - like solution and the reissner - nordstrm solution like to fig.[fig1 ] .    on these @xmath28horizons",
    "we should match :    * the flux of the 4d electric field ( defined by the 4d maxwell equations ) with the flux of the 5d electric field defined by @xmath34 kaluza - klein equation . *",
    "the area of the reissner - nordstrm event horizon with the area of the @xmath28horizon .    in the spacetime",
    "foam can be two different types of quantum handles : the first type does not entrap the electric force lines , the second type respectively entrap these lines .",
    "we will not consider the first type of quantum handles . in this case",
    "the quantum handle of the second type ( in the minimalist wormhole approximation ) is presented on fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] .    in the next section we will consider an approximate model of the spacetime foam where we neglect the cross section of quantum handles .",
    "it means that the area of cross section of the throat is contracted into a point .",
    "such approximation for the quantum handle is called as the minimalist wormhole . and",
    "further we will consider the consequences for such approximation .",
    "thus , in this section we have presented a microscopic model of the quantum handle .",
    "but in the next sections we will consider an effective model of the spacetime foam where we will neglect of the cross section of quantum handles in the spacetime foam .",
    "let us introduce an operator @xmath35 which describes creation / annihilation minimalist wormhole connected two points @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite @xcite .",
    "let the operator @xmath35 has the following property @xmath38 it means that the reiterated creation / annihilation minimalist wormhole is senseless .",
    "this property tell us that the operator @xmath35 can be connected with the grassman numbers . in the general case",
    "the operator @xmath35 is nonlocal one but in this paper we will consider the simplest case when @xmath35 can be factorized on two local operators @xmath39 the operator @xmath40 can be considered as _ a readiness _ of a point @xmath36 to pasting together with a point @xmath37 ( or conversely the separation these points in the minimalist wormhole ) .",
    "we will consider three cases .",
    "* * is @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the undotted spinor indices , @xmath43 is the scalar field , @xmath44 is the grassman number @xmath45 it is easy to proof that @xmath46 where @xmath47    eq .",
    "[ sec1 - 50 ] means that it makes no sense to identify two points twice .",
    "* * is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is an undotted spinor field in @xmath50 representation .",
    "the square is zero @xmath51 in this case @xmath52 .",
    "it means that the minimalist wormhole can connect only two different points .",
    "* * is @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a dotted spinor in @xmath55 representation .",
    "the square is zero @xmath56 as @xmath57 we must note that as the classical canonical theory can not describes topology change these operators do not correspond to any classical observables .",
    "it corresponds to the well - known fact that the grassman numbers do not have any classical interpretation .",
    "we can suppose that @xmath35 operator is described with dynamical fields : scalar field @xmath43 or spinor field @xmath58 .",
    "below we will present some equations for these fields and discuss the physical sense of corresponding solutions .",
    "it is interesting to note that in ref .",
    "@xcite very similar idea is considered that the gravitational interactions ( topology fluctuations ) presented in the spacetime foam are modelled by means of nonlocal interactions ( operator @xmath35 in our case ) that relate spacetime points and these nonlocal interactions can be described in terms of local interactions ( @xmath40 in our case ) .",
    "the operator @xmath35 can be connected with an indefiniteness ( the loss of information ) of our knowledge about two points @xmath59 and @xmath60  : we do not know if these points are connected by the quantum minimalist wormhole or not .",
    "we would like to note that the similar idea was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite : the author investigates the consequences of the loss of information about the topology of the background spacetime and found that the existence of spacetime foam leads to a situation where the number of bosonic fields is a variable quantity .",
    "are the functions @xmath43 and @xmath61 dynamical or not ? of coarse , in the context of this paper we do not have the answer on this question because here is proposed only an effective model of the spacetime foam .",
    "the exact model of the spacetime foam can be obtained only from a quantum gravity theory . from the physical point of view",
    "we can expect that the state and properties of spacetime foam depend on the magnitude of gravitational and external ( for example , e&m ) fields .",
    "the aim of this paper is to try to describe the state of spacetime foam by some effective way using some ( scalar / spinor ) field .",
    "common sense guides us to suppose that it is possible if we neglect the cross section of each quantum handle in the spacetime foam .",
    "it means that each quantum handle looks like to two points connected by a line ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] ) and this ( scalar or spinor ) field give us an information about quantum handles .",
    "below we will see that it is the information about the typical length of quantum handles in the spacetime foam .",
    "another question appearing in the context of this section is : what kind of wormhole operator is realized in the real spacetime foam or every such possibility can happen in the spacetime foam ? again the answer lies in quantum gravity theory .",
    "nevertheless , we can compare the results of similar calculations for the different choice of the minimalist operator in order that to select those coincides with our common sense . for this we will compare the wormhole operator @xmath35 for the different cases : for the scalar and spinor fields .",
    "it is evident that @xmath62 if the points @xmath36 and @xmath37 are well away from each other .",
    "for example , for the ordinary spacetime foam ( without any external influence ) @xmath63 consequently we will use this criteria in the next sections for the choice between all possibilities for the effective field ( scalar or spinor ) .",
    "for the description of the dynamics of the scalar field we offer the following ( dilaton gravity + maxwell ) lagrangian @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the determinant of the 4d metric , @xmath66 is the ricci scalar , @xmath67 is the dilaton field and @xmath68 is the tensor of the electromagnetic field , @xmath69 .",
    "it means that we interpret the above - mentioned scalar field as the dilaton field .",
    "the corresponding field equations are @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the ricci tensor and @xmath72 is the tensor - momentum for dilaton and maxwell fields .",
    "each minimalist wormhole ( as a quantum handle in the spacetime foam ) looks as a dipole because one mouth entraps the electric force lines and another mouth will emerges these force lines . at first sight our choice of scalar field as the dilaton field is arbitrary but now we would like to explain why it is the natural choice .",
    "if we take a look over fig.[fig1a ] than we see that the electric force lines around the quantum handle behave like to electric force lines in the presence of an electric dipole .",
    "how we can effectively ( and approximately ) describe the set of minimalist wormholes which entrap and emerge electric force lines ?",
    "we suppose that an external electric field acts on the minimalist wormhole ( quantum handle ) so that they line up with the electric field .",
    "then such orientation of the minimalist wormholes will change the external electric field just as it happens in a dielectric .",
    "another words we can introduce an effective electric displacement @xmath73 which will describe the result of polarization of spacetime foam . as usually this vector @xmath73 should be connected with the electric field as @xmath74 ( where @xmath75 is a dielectric permeability ) .",
    "the ordinary maxwell equations looks as @xmath76 comparing eq . with the maxwell + dilaton equation eq .",
    "we see that the dielectric permeability @xmath75 can be connected with the dilaton field @xmath67 by the following way @xmath77 and the electric displacement @xmath78 @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the polarization vector .",
    "we would like to consider the static spherically symmetric case with the metric @xmath81 the solution is @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are some constants , @xmath6 is the electric charge . for us",
    "interesting is the following case @xmath85 where the electric charge and field is in the natural units : @xmath86 = cm$ ] and @xmath87 = cm^{-1}$ ] .",
    "it is necessary to note that we have a gravitational singularity at the point @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "our interpretation of this solution is the following .",
    "it is a bare electric charge @xmath6 surrounded by a polarized spacetime foam ( psf ) .",
    "the psf is described by the dilaton field @xmath67 which is connected with the operator @xmath35 describing the minimalist wormhole . at the infinity @xmath90 that means @xmath91 and @xmath92 , _ i.e. _ the psf absents at the infinity .",
    "let us consider @xmath93 where @xmath94 ; @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the locations of the mouthes of the minimalist wormhole ( quantum handle ) .",
    "we see that @xmath97 by @xmath98 .",
    "it allows us to say that in the spacetime foam only the points on the distance @xmath99 can be pasted together making the quantum handle . in such interpretation @xmath100",
    "nevertheless , in some external field the magnitude @xmath84 can have various values . as it was mentioned in sec .",
    "[ model ] the longitudinal size of the solution presented there can have arbitrary value which depends on the relation between electric @xmath9 and magnetic @xmath10 fields .",
    "it means that in the presence of a big external magnetic field the magnitude @xmath84 can be very large .",
    "now we would like to present some physical consequences of our model of the bare charge imbedded in the psf .",
    "in this subsection we would like to calculate a surface density of bounded electric charges connected with the polarization of the spacetime foam .",
    "at first we will calculate the normal component @xmath101 of the polarization vector @xmath102 the surface density @xmath103 of the bound charges is @xmath104 consequently a charge @xmath105 on the little sphere surrounding the bare charge @xmath6 is @xmath106 thus the psf completely shield the bare electric charge .",
    "another consequence is that the psf intercepts all the force lines of the bare charge and redistributes their in the surrounding space .      from the above - mentioned results we see that the spacetime foam surrounding the bare electric charge redistributes electric force lines by such a way that the charge is screened .",
    "this leads to the fact that the effective electric displacement can be introduced and as the consequence the energy density of the bare charge is changed . in this subsection",
    "we would like to calculate the energy of the electric charge surrounded by the psf .",
    "let us calculate the energy @xmath107 of the electric field @xmath108 where we have used the condition @xmath109 and @xmath110 is the determinant of the 3d metric .",
    "is very interesting .",
    "we see that the energy of the charge surrounded by the psf depends on some characteristic length @xmath84 which is connected with the typical length of quantum handles in spacetime foam .",
    "usually the typical length of quantum handles is @xmath111 . in this case @xmath112 and the advantage of this formula is evident : it is a finite number whereas the energy of the point charge in the classical electrodynamics is infinite number .    as indicated above",
    "there is the possibility when the typical length of quantum handles can be larger ( in the presence of a big external magnetic field ) .",
    "it is interesting to determine the value of @xmath84 so that this energy can be compared with the rest energy of electron @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the rest mass of electron . in this case",
    "the typical length of quantum handles is @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) and it can be compared with the classical radius of electron . of coarse such value of quantum handles is too much .",
    "now we would like to calculate some gravitational effects connected with the metric .",
    "the metric approximately is @xmath117 we see that the metric in this model is not flat .",
    "the difference can be measured as a deficit of the sphere area @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the distance between the origin ( @xmath120 ) and the sphere with the radius @xmath121 @xmath122 it means that @xmath123 let us remind that in the chosen coordinate system @xmath124 .",
    "thus this model of electron with the psf give us the finite rest energy of electron ( connected with its renormalized electric field ) but at the center of electron we have a gravitational singularity .",
    "also we should note that at the center of electron the electric field @xmath125 is finite but the direction of this vector is undefined .",
    "the picture of @xmath126 at the center is like to a hedgehog .",
    "the experimental verified consequences of this model is the nonflat metric and the difference between @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "for example , at the distance @xmath129 we have the deficit of the sphere area @xmath130 and the dielectric permeability @xmath131 evidently it is too much but it can be connected with that our dilaton model of the psf is approximate one .",
    "nevertheless on the basis of such model we have the interesting model of screening of the bare electric charge with the finite energy of the electric field .",
    "in this section we would like to consider the spinor model of the psf with the following lagrangian @xmath132 } -                  \\frac{1}{4}l^2_0                  \\left ( \\gamma^5\\gamma^\\mu \\right )                  \\left ( i\\bar\\psi \\gamma^5\\gamma_\\mu                  \\psi \\right ) - \\frac{m}{i }                  \\right ) \\psi   + h.c .",

    "our hope is that the future investigations will give us the more natural explanation for this choice .",

    "the ansatz for the spinor field has a preferred direction ( the spin direction ) but the psf is a quantum fluctuating object therefore we should average our results over the spin direction .",

    "our solution with @xmath174 and @xmath175 describes a ball of the polarized spacetime foam filled with the electric field .",
    "another words , the psf can confine electric field in some volume and it is * _ a pure quantum gravity phenomenon_*. we can expect that the energy density of the electric field will be very big and it will depend on the properties of the psf , _",
    "i.e. _ on the typical length of quantum handles .",
    "eq s - show us that the spinor field is nonzero inside of a region with the linear sizes @xmath176 .",
    "it means that the operator @xmath35 is nonzero in this region and consequently the typical length of quantum handles are @xmath84 .      the basic purpose of this section is to calculate the psf ball with the confined electric field and compare this energy with some big interesting energies ( nuclear bomb , gamma ray burst ( grb ) ) . at first",
    "we would like to write eq s in the dimensionless form @xmath177 the numerical solution of these equations presented on the fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "and now we can calculate the energy of the electric field @xmath178 where the numerical coefficient @xmath179 is necessary for the conversion the natural units to the cgs units .",
    "the numerical value of the integral is of the order of 1 .",
    "therefore we can estimate the value of @xmath180 @xmath181 now we would like to calculate the radius @xmath84 and electric field @xmath9 for two characteristic energies .    *",
    "1 . nuclear bomb*. in this case @xmath182 and @xmath183 the value of the electric field can be estimated as @xmath184 the values of the @xmath185 and @xmath186 inside of the ball are of the order of unity .",
    "it gives us @xmath187 consequently the psf ball filled with the electric field can contain the energy of the order of the energy of the nuclear bomb .",
    "it can happen if the typical length of the quantum handles is @xmath188 .    *",
    "gamma ray burst*. in this case @xmath189 and @xmath190 the electric field is estimated as @xmath191 consequently the psf ball filled with the electric field can contain the energy of the order of the energy of the grb and the linear sizes of this ball are of the order of @xmath192 .",
    "it means that : in order to obtain such energy @xmath193 the typical length of quantum handles must be @xmath194 .",
    "again we would like remind that there is a possibility to make handles with the big longitudinal size : it can be in the presence of the big external magnetic field . in conclusion",
    "we would like to say that the big e&m fields can produce quantum gravitational effects with the release of enormous amount of energy .",
    "the value of such energies latent in the psf ball is not surprising because it is quantum gravity effects .",
    "the big question here is : can be such energy of the electric field extracted from the frozen state in the polarized spacetime foam ?",
    "another questions are : how can be such objects created and how fast it will disintegrate  ?",
    "another interesting peculiarity of the spinor equation is that @xmath140 can be the planck length @xmath195 and nevertheless this microscopical equation can give the macroscopical energy and linear sizes !",
    "it is interesting to note that eq .",
    "is one of the variants of the heisenberg equation for a non - linear spinor field @xcite .",
    "this remark allows us to take a new interpretation of the solutions obtained in these ref s : it is the psf ball on a microscopical level .",
    "in this paper we offer an approximate model of the polarized spacetime foam .",
    "the microscopically description is based on the operator @xmath35 of creation / destruction the minimalist wormholes .",
    "the minimalist wormhole is some approximation for the quantum handle when it is contracted into a point .",
    "the model for the quantum handle is given by the wormhole - like solution of the 5d kaluza - klein gravity .",
    "this metric contains off - diagonal components of the 5d metric @xmath196 and @xmath197 which can be considered as an electric and magnetic fields .",
    "it allows us to consider each quantum handle ( minimalist wormhole ) as an electric dipole . obviously that in such point of view the spacetime foam can be polarized in the presence of an external electric field .",
    "the operator @xmath35 can be connected with either a scalar or a spinor field . here",
    "the question arises : is this operator a consequence of quantum gravity or it is an additional stuff in quantum gravity describing the topology changes ?",
    "we assume that these fields can be dynamical . as a model of the scalar field",
    "we propose the dilaton field . in this case",
    "the dilaton field describes a polarization of the spacetime foam . in the result",
    "we have a shielding of the bare electric charge and the finiteness of the energy of the electric field .",
    "the physical sense of the scalar / spinor fields in the operator @xmath35 is the following : * _ the product @xmath198 ( or @xmath199 ) describes the typical length of quantum handles in the spacetime foam _ * , _ i.e. _ the linear sizes of the region where this product is nonzero characterizes the typical length of quantum handles .    in the another variant a spinor field describes the polarization of the spacetime foam .",
    "we have considered the simplest case without external electric charges and gravity .",
    "we have shown that the polarized spacetime foam can confine an electric field in some finite region of the space .",
    "the magnitude of the confined electric field can be very big .",
    "we have shown that this energy depends on the typical length of quantum handles and for the energy of nuclear bomb this length is @xmath200 and for the grb it is @xmath194 .",
    "it is necessary to note that in the consequences of the very high energy density of the electric field confined in the psf the experimental verification of the effects connected with quantum gravity is very dangerous , * _ much more dangerous then the experiments with the nuclear energies ! _ *    in this paper we have considered two possibilities for the description of the spacetime foam : the scalar and spinor fields . of coarse , the choice between these two possibilities can be made either on the basis of an exact theory of quantum gravity or from an experiment .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have neither .",
    "therefore we can only compare the consequences of two approaches and choose more natural .",
    "the comparison of solutions for the scalar field eq s - and spinor field fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows us that the first solution has a singularity at the center of the field whereas the spinor field does not have a singularity .",
    "it means that the spinor field is more natural choice for the description of the psf .",
    "another argument for this statement is the following .",
    "let us compare the polarization vector for the `` scalar - generated '' model of the spacetime foam @xmath201 and for the `` fermion - generated '' model of the spacetime foam @xmath202 } \\psi \\right ) \\label{concl-20}\\ ] ] now we see how is the difference between the `` scalar - generated '' and `` fermion - generated '' models of the spacetime foam .",
    "for the first case the polarization vector is proportional to an external electric field @xmath203 whereas in the second case @xmath204 does not direct depend on this field .",
    "the second case is more interesting since in this case we have very intriguing situation : an electric field can be confined with the spacetime foam in some finite region without any hairs at the infinity .",
    "in fact such situation was discussed in sec.5 .",
    "it is very unusual situation when a static electric field exists without any electric charges .",
    "the explanation for this fact is very simple : the sum of this electric field and the electric field generated by spacetime foam is zero ( see , eq . ) .",
    "finally we would like to summarize    * each quantum handle in the spacetime foam is like to an electric dipole . *",
    "it is possible to introduce an operator describing a quantum handle .",
    "* in the presence of an external electric field the spacetime foam can be polarized . *",
    "the polarized spacetime foam can shield a bare electric charge . *",
    "the energy of the shielded charge becomes finite .",
    "* the polarized spacetime foam can confine electric field into finite region . * the energy of confined electric field can be very big .",
    "the problems originating here are the following    * at the center of the shielded charge there is a gravitational singularity .",
    "it is possible to avoid it in some more realistic scenario ? *",
    "must be quantized the scalar and spinor fields ?",
    "is it not trivial question because these fields are some approximate description of the spacetime foam and consequently they already connected with quantum gravity . * how can be created the ball with the confined electric fields : is it a quantum fluctuation of the metric or it was created in the early universe and now only disintegrate ? * what is the duration of the life of these objects : exist they infinitely or disintegrate after some finite time ?",
    "* what give us switching on the gravity : the ball will be the same with some modifications or something different  ?",
