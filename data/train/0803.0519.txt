    "the study of star - formation is entering a new era with the advent of large ( sub-)millimetre arrays such as the esma ( sma - jcmt - cso combined ) , carma , and later alma .",
    "these facilities will provide crucial new information on the gas kinematics in pre - stellar cores , proto - stars and circumstellar disks in nearby star - forming clouds , matching , or in the case of alma , exceeding the spatial resolution of the _ hubble space telescope_. the _ spitzer space telescope _ has recently mapped the infrared emissions from a large number of candidate , low - mass young stellar objects belonging to classes 0 , i , ii in nearby ( @xmath3200300  pc ) interstellar clouds ( e.g. j@xmath4rgensen et al .",

    "2007 ; porras et al .",
    "no doubt these newly detected sources will later become ideal targets for the large arrays .    of particular interest when studying the earliest stages of star - formation , as in starless ` pre - protostellar ' cores ( ppcs ; ward - thompson et al .",
    "1994 ) , and class  0 sources , is the identification and characterization of the associated gas infall , which requires the kinematic interpretation of the observed molecular line profiles .",
    "this is by no means straightforward and in some cases the approach has been based on statistics : key core - collapse indicators , such as the relative number of blue- versus red - shifted line profiles ( quantified as a normalized velocity difference ) , or the ` blue ' to ` red ' peak intensity ratio , are analyzed drawing from a bulk sample of infall candidates ( e.g. mardones et al .",
    "1997 ; gregersen et al .",
    "2000 ; gregersen & evans 2000 ; sohn et al .",
    "these studies can be greatly assisted by detailed modelling of pre - stellar cores ; such models , including sophisticated molecular line radiative transfer ( rt ) and/or dust rt calculations , have been presented by evans et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , ward - thompson & buckley ( 2001 ) , redman et al .",

    "( 2006 ) amongst others .",
    "the studies of redman et al . and pavlyuchenkov et al .",
    ", in particular , have demonstrated how effects other than infall , such as rotation of the core , can be inferred from a proper modelling of the observed line profiles .",
    "the large number of poorly constrained free parameters in the models suggests two alternative approaches to the problem ; ( i ) generic modelling , where the sensitivities of the line profiles to the various free parameters are analyzed  with a view to identifying and breaking possible degeneracies , and ( ii ) modelling individual sources / datasets , making plausible assumptions concerning the physical and chemical natures of the source .",
    "this study adopts the former approach and follows the exploratory work of rawlings & yates ( 2001 ; hereafter ry01 ) .",
    "ry01 presented preliminary results obtained from coupled chemical / dynamical and line rt models applicable to generic , low - mass ( 13m@xmath5 ) infalling cores . in that paper",
    "they explored the sensitivity of the emerging line profiles to limited variations in a subset of the free parameters in the chemistry and dynamics .",
    "although they only considered two transitions ( hco@xmath6  @xmath7 @xmath8 4@xmath93 and cs @xmath7 @xmath8 3@xmath92 ) , they found that the line profiles are _ extremely _ sensitive to assumed gas - grain interaction efficiencies and the dynamical history of the core .",
    "the line profiles are less sensitive to the cosmic ray ionization rate ( as a consequence of the fact that the timescale for the gas - phase chemistry is less significant than the freeze - out timescale ) .    as an example of the second approach , evans et al .",
    "( 2005 ) attempted to model 25 transitions of 17 isotopologues in the well - known infall source b335 ( e.g. zhou et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the model included a careful consideration of the thermal balance and calculated both the gas and dust temperatures . assuming that the dynamics of the source can be described by the shu ( 1977 ) ` inside - out ' collapse model , preceded by the quasi - static contraction of a sequence of bonnor - ebert spheres , reasonably good matches with the observational data can be obtained , provided the cosmic ray ionization rate and the sulphur abundance are enhanced .",
    "however , it must be emphasized , that this result whilst _ compatible _ with the assumed chemistry and dynamics does not not unequivocally _ validate _ those assumptions . the standard model of low - mass star formation which advocates that a core collapses via ambipolar diffusion , followed by inside - out infall after it has become supercritical ( shu et al .",
    "1987 ) , has been challenged by observations showing evidence of extended inward motions and non - zero infall velocities ( @xmath30.1 kms@xmath10 ) at large core radii ( @xmath310@xmath11 au ) ; see , for instance , sources such as l1544 ( tafalla et al . 1998 ) , iram 04191 ( belloche et al . 2002 ) , l1551 ( swift et al . 2006 ) .",
    "observations of b335 , on the other hand , have been adequately explained by the standard model ( zhou et al .",
    "1993 ; choi et al .",
    "even for this most well studied infall source , however , the exact interpretation of the blue / red line asymmetry for some molecular tracers is further complicated by the presence of an outflow ( e.g. choi 2007 ) .    an analysis of 50 ppcs by sohn et al . ( 2007 ) estimated the amount , @xmath12 , by which the hcn ( @xmath7 @xmath8 10 ) hyperfine spectrum is blue- or red - shifted with respect to the line centre of the optically thin tracer n@xmath1h@xmath0  ( @xmath7 @xmath8 10 ) , and revealed that the @xmath12 distribution of the hcn ( @xmath7 @xmath8 01 ) components is skewed to the blue consistent with systematic inward motions in the cores  the degree of skewness was greater than for the other infall tracers they used ( cs @xmath7 @xmath8 21 , dco@xmath0 @xmath7 @xmath8 21 , and n@xmath1h@xmath0  @xmath7 @xmath8 10 ) . in four out of 12 infall candidates ( l63 , l492 ,",
    "l694 - 2 , and l1197 ) the blue to red peak asymmetry ratio was larger for the hyperfine line with the lowest opacity ( @xmath13 @xmath8 01 ) , which is a better tracer of dense inner regions , suggesting that these cores may show _ increasing _ gas velocities towards their centres .",
    "the exact shape of the velocity profiles in starless cores , however , is an open issue : for example , lee et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have modelled two of these cores adopting a ` @xmath2-shaped ' profile which calls for an approximately zero - infall velocity in the innermost core regions ( as opposed to inside - out collapse where the velocity there is the largest ) with a peak in velocity somewhere in the intermediate regions .",
    "this contradicts the work of williams , lee and myers ( 2006 ) who modelled one of the cores in the lee et al .",
    "study with a velocity profile increasing towards the centre .",
    "clearly , the models may not be unique and the adopted velocity laws may be representative of only a particular evolutionary phase of a core .    in this study",
    "we adhere to the inside - out model of collapse and extend the analysis of ry01 concentrating on the effects of the thermal structure and the molecular abundance of infall tracer species on the emerging line asymmetry ( in the form of the peak blue / red ratio  not the normalized velocity difference of mardones et al .",
    "we adopt models of low - mass ( @xmath33m@xmath5 ) static and infalling cores subject to time - dependent chemical evolution , and investigate the various line profiles simulated by means of an accelerated @xmath2-iteration ( ali ) rt code .",
    "the main focus of this paper is a theoretical analysis of the line asymmetry in the context of the inside - out paradigm of protostellar collapse .",
    "the hydrodynamical , chemical and rt models , and model assumptions , are presented in section 2 .",
    "the results are presented in section 3 , and our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "as described above when trying to analyze the molecular line profiles , there are a number of free - parameters that need to be defined / constrained .",
    "these can be summarized as follows :    \\(i ) the instantaneous density and temperature profiles , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "\\(ii ) the instantaneous systemic velocity profile , @xmath16 .",
    "\\(iii ) the instantaneous microturbulent velocity profile , @xmath17 .",
    "\\(iv ) the chemical abundance profiles , @xmath18 .",
    "+ the chemical abundance profiles are particularly hard to constrain as they can ( critically ) depend on the assumed initial conditions and the _ history _ of the object .",
    "for example , rawlings et al . (",
    "2002 ) showed that the chemical evolution of many species is highly dependent on the assumed initial h : h@xmath1 ratio .",
    "moreover , as the dynamical and chemical kinetic timescales are comparable ( @xmath3 10@xmath19yr ) , the abundance profiles are sensitive to the dynamical evolution in both the collapse _ and _ the pre - collapse phases . as well as the dependencies on the cosmic ray ionization rate and the elemental abundances etc .",
    ", the chemistry is critically dependent on the assumptions concerning the gas - grain interactions : e.g. the effective grain surface areas , the sticking efficiencies , the desorption mechanisms ( and efficiencies ) and the surface chemistry .",
    "each of the free parameters discussed above should be considered in a full sensitivity analysis . in this study",
    "we concentrate on a subset .",
    "this is partly for the sake of brevity and clarity , and partly because we consider these free parameters to be particularly important .",
    "the density and dust temperature profiles [ @xmath14 , @xmath20 of protostellar cores are now reasonably well - constrained by continuum data . for the dust temperature , @xmath21(@xmath22 )",
    ", we use radial profiles appropriate for ppcs and class  0 sources : for the former case we adopted the generic profile computed by evans et al .",
    "( 2001 ; their fig .",
    "3 ) who used a 1d continuum radiative transfer model ; for the latter case the radial profile is the one deduced by zhou et al .",
    "( 1990 ) from dust continuum observations of b335 for a luminosity of @xmath3 3l@xmath5 ( again using a radiative transfer model ",
    "see also shirley , evans & rawlings 2002 who obtained very similar temperature profiles ) .",
    "these two profiles respectively denoted @xmath23  and @xmath24  are shown in fig",
    ".  1 . in both cases",
    "we assume that the dust and kinetic gas , @xmath25(@xmath22 ) , temperatures are thermally coupled , i.e. @xmath25(@xmath22 )  @xmath8 @xmath21(@xmath22 ) , an assumption which probably holds in the denser line - forming regions of the core s center .",
    "observationally , variations in the temperature profiles within each protostellar class are relatively small , so we make the simplification that the profiles do not vary with time .",
    "as the level populations are only dependent on the instantaneous temperatures and the range of temperatures involved ( @xmath3 816k ) is too small to lead to chemical variations , the history of the temperature profiles is of little significance ( see however section  3.3 ) .",
    "note that , although all of the results that we present in this work are for inside - out collapsing cores , we have considered both the @xmath23  and @xmath24temperature profiles .",
    "this allows us to determine the sensitivity of the simulated line profiles to the assumed temperature distribution , even though ( i ) a shu - type collapse is not , in all probability , universally applicable to protostellar infall sources , and ( ii ) realistically a @xmath23  temperature profile is _ not _ expected following the formation of the singular isothermal spheroid ( sis ) which forms the basis of the inside - out collapse .    in this study",
    "we do not investigate the sensitivities to the temporal evolution of the density and velocity laws either during the collapse , or the pre - collapse phases . nor do we consider the possibility of the presence of non - thermal ( i.e. magnetic ) support .",
    "instead , we assume a purely gravitational collapse , and impose the exact dynamical collapse solution of shu ( 1977 ) . for the physical and chemical ` pre - evolution ' , we follow ry01 and adopt the initial conditions of an irradiated diffuse cloud , of density 10@xmath26@xmath27 , that is in a state of chemical equilibrium , and allow it to contract to the sis configuration that forms the initial basis for the shu ( 1977 ) model .",
    "this contraction is represented by a retarded free - fall collapse parametrized as in rawlings et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and has a duration of the order of 10@xmath19 yr . the extinction is dynamically calculated as a function of position and time , both during this initial collapse phase , and also during the subsequent inside - out collapse .",
    "this approach , although somewhat arbitrary , is probably reasonably representative of the ( empirically unconstrained ) evolution of a cloud from a diffuse state to a pre - collapse core .",
    "we defer a full analysis of the sensitivities of the line profiles to the dynamics to a later study .",
    "as emphasized above , gas - grain interactions are very poorly constrained  a fact that is often overlooked in studies of this type .",
    "for instance , roberts et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have showed that the desorption mechanisms and efficiencies are particularly uncertain .",
    "they advocate a more empirical approach , which is what we adopt in this study : thus , the dust grains , which are characterized by a population - averaged surface area ( as in rawlings et al .",
    "1992 ) , are treated only as an inert ` sink ' for gas - phase species and the chemistry consists solely of gas - phase chemical reactions .",
    "the freeze - out of gas - phase material onto the surface of grains is represented with a nominal sticking efficiency of @xmath28 for most species .",
    "we additionally assume that freeze - out only occurs above some critical value of the extinction , @xmath29 .",
    "the value that we adopt in this study , @xmath29 @xmath8 4.0 , is similar to that deduced for taurus ( @xmath8 3.3 ) based on the observed correlations between the 3@xmath30 m water ice feature and visual extinction ( whittet et al .",

    "for the telescope beam we have used characteristics of a 45-m antenna corresponding to the nobeyama class .",
    "we have used beam efficiency data from commonly used systems based on the nobeyama 45-m , the iram 30-m , and the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) 15-m antennae and modelled these as a putative 45-m class telescope ( putative in the sense that no 45-m dish exists that can fully sample the frequency range that covers all of the transitions that we have considered ) .",

    "the full set of results is given in numerical form in table  a1 of the appendix . in constructing this table , and for the sake of brevity ,",
    "we have reduced individual line profiles to the peak line intensities of the blue - shifted components ( @xmath52 ) and the ratio of blue- to red - shifted component intensities ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the tabulated intensities were determined by fitting gaussians to the simulated line profiles as if they were observed spectra .",
    "we refer to the quantity @xmath53 as the line asymmetry ratio ( or blue excess ) .",
    "this ratio is also marked by the horizontal lines in fig .",
    "inspection of this figure allows the evaluation of the dependence of the line strength and asymmetry on the adopted abundance distributions in the core .    for almost all transitions and collapse periods considered in this study",
    "the peak line intensities , as well as the integrated fluxes , are the weakest for abundance distributions that increase outwards from the centre of the core .",
    "this can be explained in terms of a smaller optical depth and hence weaker emergent line intensity for regions of the core where the mass - averaged abundance of a molecular tracer is particularly low .",
    "for example , in the case of hco@xmath0  at @xmath44  @xmath8 1.36@xmath4210@xmath54yr this is true between @xmath3 0.03  0.09pc , and the line intensities corresponding to the ` increasing ' abundance profile are typically weaker than for the other profiles . for cs the ` model ' and ` increasing ' abundance profiles show similar , radially increasing mass - averaged distributions out to @xmath3 0.12pc .",
    "the line intensities for these profiles are lower than for the constant and ` decreasing ' profiles which are associated with larger mass - averaged abundances over the same region .",
    "also , the difference in line intensities from the adoption of the ` increasing ' as opposed to , for example , the ` decreasing ' abundance profile is more pronounced for lines of higher critical density ( @xmath55 ) and smaller hpbw as these are less efficiently excited at large core radii where the gas density is low .    in figs .  5 and 7 we present plots of the line asymmetry ratio ( using some of the values given in table  a1 ) for observationally interesting transitions of cs and hco@xmath0  respectively , showing the temporal evolution of the line asymmetry ratio for models with a @xmath23  and @xmath24  temperature distribution .",
    "we can deduce several trends from these results and discuss them in the following subsections .",
    "in our study we find that for both the @xmath23  and @xmath24  temperature distributions the line asymmetry ratio generally increases with time for the @xmath7 = 10 transition for the ` model ' and ` decreasing ' abundance distributions ; it shows a very slight increase for a constant molecular abundance , while it remains mostly flat with the ` increasing ' abundance distribution . in the latter case",
    "the line is almost symmetric , but the line does show a slight red asymmetry ( @xmath56/@xmath57 @xmath50 1 ) in models with a @xmath23  temperature distribution : the symmetric profiles are due to the decreased line opacity resulting from the depressed molecular abundance towards the core s centre .",
    "the slight red asymmetry is caused by a positive outward gradient of the line excitation temperature ( @xmath58 ) given the @xmath23  profile in the inner core .",
    "the blue asymmetry shows a rather stronger sensitivity on the abundance distribution for the 10 than for the 21 transition , especially at later times",
    "( fig .  5 ) .",
    "the 21 line overall shows similar behaviours to that of the 10 line with rising asymmetry ratios at later times ( except for a constant and ` increasing ' abundance in the @xmath24  case ) : the asymmetry ratios however are generally _ lower _ and this is caused by the smaller hpbw of this transition which covers about half the collapsing area of the cloud during each collapse period ( relative to the 10 line ) , and the higher critical density of this line compared to the 10 transition ( 1.1@xmath4210@xmath59 vs. 1.6@xmath4210@xmath60@xmath27 ) . for the @xmath24  temperature profile the asymmetry ratios of the 21 , 32 and 43 lines initially ( at 1.36 @xmath42 10@xmath54 yr ) attain higher values than that of the 10 line .",
    "this is due to the smaller hpbws of these lines which during that time respectively cover the central 38 , 25 , and 19 per cent of the infalling region thus sampling the warmest , dense inner regions of the cloud .    in fig .",
    "6 we show an example of the radiative transfer solution for the excitation temperature of representative hco@xmath0  lines for both our adopted temperature profiles and for two different abundance distributions . for a given temperature profile",
    "the @xmath58  variations per line across the cloud appear similar , but the temperatures are all slightly higher in the top compared to the bottom panel along points in the cloud where the ` decreasing ' abundance distribution results in a larger concentration of hco@xmath0  than the ` model ' abundance distribution .",
    "the opposing trends caused by the two different kinetic temperature profiles ( fig .  1 )",
    "are especially evident towards the centre of the cloud .",

    "the lines attain blue asymmetry ratios during the late collapse stages as the expanding cew encounters a negative @xmath58  outward gradient ( for log(@xmath22 ) @xmath61 3.8 ) : the 10 and 21 lines then reach slightly higher @xmath62/@xmath57 ratios than the 32 and 43 lines and this must be caused by the better sampling ( larger hpbw ) of the infalling region , combined with an increased line opacity for the former diagnostics ( especially when the ` model ' and ` decreasing ' abundance distributions are adopted ) .    for the @xmath24  temperature profile , the 32 and 43 lines initially show blue asymmetries ( @xmath56/@xmath57 @xmath51 1 ) with a spread depending on the adopted abundance distribution .",
    "this affects differently the line opacity in each case , but as the collapse progresses the line profiles become more symmetric : due to the central placement of the beams these high critical density lines ( 3.4@xmath4210@xmath19 and 9.1@xmath4210@xmath19@xmath27respectively ) cover at each successive collapse period a decreasing fraction of the infalling gas volume whose density steadily falls . at @xmath44",

    "this is also true for the 54 transition ; this is always a very weak line .",
    "compared to hco@xmath0 , the difference between the line asymmetry resulting from the adoption of different kinetic temperature profiles is not so pronounced , although for the @xmath24  models slightly higher blue asymmetries are obtained .",
    "how can the different behaviour of cs compared to hco@xmath0  be explained ?",

    "the high @xmath55  lines 43 and 54 , which incidentally also have the smallest hpbws , do not follow this trend at late collapse times because by then the core density is low and the lines are not sufficiently opaque compared to the lower @xmath7 transitions .",
    "the 54 line becomes very weak after the first collapse period ( table a1 ) as it has a high critical density ( 9 @xmath42 10@xmath19  @xmath27 ) and can not be efficiently excited in the decreasing density of the infalling envelope at later times . as cs is depleted in the chemical model in the inner core",

    ", we see that the hco@xmath0  @xmath7 @xmath8 32 , 43 , and 54 transitions follow an inverse trend in the temporal evolution of their blue asymmetry compared to the 10 transition . to help visualize these effects we plot in fig .",
    "8 the time evolution of the _ relative _ blue excess ; @xmath64 results are shown for models with a @xmath24  temperature profile where effects are most noticeable .",
    "similarly , in fig .",
    "9 we plot the evolution of the relative blue excess , @xmath65 , of the cs @xmath7 @xmath8 10 _ vs. _ the 43 transition ( for models with @xmath23  and @xmath24  distributions ) .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath65 corresponding to these transitions depends on the dynamical age , and models with different abundance distributions follow the same general trend .",
    "a similar dependence is the one emerging from a comparison of the contrasting evolution of the hco@xmath0  43 vs. the cs 32 line ( compare figs .  5 and 7",
    ", for a core with a @xmath24  temperature profile and a ` model ' abundance distribution ) .",
    "these behaviours are mostly due to the varying spatial sampling of parts of the core at various infall times by the different line frequencies employed , given the adopted 45-m antenna and the centrally placed beams .",
    "for instance , the hco@xmath0  @xmath7 @xmath8 10 line samples 76 per cent of the infall region at @xmath66 @xmath8 2.72@xmath4210@xmath54yr , when the 32 and 43 transitions sample 25 and 19 per cent of its angular size respectively ( using the parameters in tables  1 and 2 ) . in trials where the 32 and 43 transitions were modelled with a beam size that matched that of the 10 line , i.e. when employing a 1115-m size antenna for the former lines and a 45-m antenna for the latter line , the evolution of the asymmetry for all these lines was roughly similar , and the trends in fig .",
    "8 virtually disappeared .",
    "the same case can be made for the cs trends of fig .",
    "9 .    in order to test whether these results are the product of a particular modelling configuration , in fig .",
    "10 we plot the relative line asymmetry , @xmath65 , of hco@xmath0  transitions modelled for a 15-m antenna ( jcmt equivalent ) and for a source distance of 250pc .",
    "this results in approximately the same spatial coverage of the core by the various transitions as when the standard values of table  2 are used .",
    "the ` model ' hco@xmath0  abundance distribution and the @xmath24  temperature profile were adopted .",
    "the dependencies on the collapse period noted above hold in this case too .",
    "this shows that as long as the spatial coverage of the core remains approximately the same , the choice of modelling configuration does not significantly affect the trends of fig .",
    "8 .    in order to further check whether these trends might still be valid for a much denser core model",
    ", we performed a simulation arbitrarily increasing the density across the core twenty - fold , up to a peak density of 3.6@xmath4210@xmath19@xmath27at the onset of infall .",
    "this value is near the top of the range of densities inferred for a sample of protostellar cores in the lynds clouds ( visser et al .",
    "2002 ) and in perseus ( motte & andr 2001 ) ; although obviously unphysical in the context of the inside - out collapse model , this simulation serves to highlight the sensitivity to density .",
    "the relative line asymmetry ratios for a set of hco@xmath0  transitions were obtained after evolving the cloud through the same collapse periods as for our standard 45-m antenna models ( control parameters of table 2 ) .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "11 and show that the dependencies identified above are still valid .    clearly , the trends in figs .",
    "811 imply that the behaviour of the _ relative _ blue excess of certain molecular transitions ( observed with a given antenna ) can be considered as a collapse chronometer in the formal context of the shu model .",
    "we have therefore shown that in idealized spherically - symmetric cores which possess inward only motions , line measurements coupled to detailed models would in theory be able to constrain the evolutionary state of the ( assumed inside - out ) collapse . a number of caveats however must accompany this statement .",
    "firstly , the question of timescales .",
    "observationally , the lifetime of submillimetre - detected , pre - stellar cores has been estimated from the statistics of detections of sources and approximate ages of 0.3myr have been established from an ensemble of various star - forming regions ( kirk et al .",
    "2005 ) . based on estimates of the lifetime of class  i sources , and using statistical methods , a reference value for starless cores ( ppcs ) is @xmath3 0.6myr ( kirk et al .",
    "2007 ) . in perseus the lifetime of submm - detected starless cores",
    "was also estimated to be @xmath3 0.4 myr ( hatchell et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the lifetime of class  0 sources , which are potential manifestations of the inside - out collapse paradigm , has been revisited : whereas it was previously estimated that it may be one order of magnitude smaller than that of class  i sources , and of the order of 10@xmath11 yr ( e.g. ward - thompson 1996 ) , it is now thought that the relative class  0/i phase lifetimes are similar ( in the perseus and lynds dark clouds at least , and assuming a constant star formation rate ) , and of the order of a few @xmath42 10@xmath54 yr ( visser et al . 2002 ; hatchell et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the infall timescales we considered fall in this range .",
    "moreover , the boundary between the class  0/i phases in terms of _ observed _ evolutionary indicators is still elusive ( hatchell et al .",
    "we thus deem that , for the purposes of this work , the choice of timescales for our collapsing core analogue is not without due justification .",
    "another caveat involves the temperature profiles we have adopted in our models and which remain constant throughout the collapse phase . in realistic situations one would expect some overall heating to ensue at later times as mass accretes onto a central protostar . in order to get an idea of how this change in temperature might affect the line asymmetry ,",
    "we run a model adopting a radial temperature profile , @xmath67(@xmath22 ) @xmath8 20(@xmath22/1000 au)@xmath68  k , corresponding to a source of @xmath3 15 l@xmath5 ( taken from ward - thompson & buckley 2001 ) . our typical class  0 temperature profile ( fig .",
    "1 ) is from the best - fit spectral energy distribution of b335 for a luminosity of @xmath3 3 l@xmath5 ( shirley et al . 2002 ) and so , in an approximate way , the above @xmath67(@xmath22 ) should represent a considerable ` evolution ' towards the class  i boundary .",
    "we find that for a _ constant _ hco@xmath0  fractional abundance of 10@xmath69 the asymmetry ratio of hco@xmath0  @xmath7 @xmath8 10 rises more steeply than the one shown in fig .  5 ( top - right panel ) corresponding to a model with a @xmath24  temperature profile . if we were to assume that heating takes place after the second collapse period then the rise of the line asymmetry would be even more pronounced .",
    "the blue excess of the 43 line decreases linearly with collapse period , similarly to the model with a @xmath24  profile , but attains slightly higher values throughout .",
    "we therefore conclude that the trend shown in fig .  8 ( bottom ) would be little affected with this change of temperature law . moreover , the line asymmetry of the 54 line is negligibly affected , and the 10/54 relative asymmetry ratio shows a dependence with dynamical age similar to those of fig .  8 as well .",
    "finally , a stronger caveat involves the possible generic applicability of the identified ` chronometers ' in studies of realistic infall candidates . as noted in section  1 , unfortunately , protostellar cores do not universally adhere to the inside - out paradigm of collapse .",
    "observed non - zero velocities at large radii and/or small infall velocities at small radii , deviations from spherical symmetry , outflows , and rotation , are all likely to affect the line asymmetry of tracer species in ways that would be particular to each source .",
    "so would observational uncertainties , such as beam pointing inaccuracies .",
    "however , the identified trends are valid in the strict context of the inside - out collapse model and give us valuable insight into the ways the line asymmetry evolves and into the main factors that drive it .    in the next paragraph",
    "we examine the line profile sensitivity to the distance from the source .",
    "the sensitivity of the line asymmetry ratio to source distance is a complex issue . for our nominal 45-m antenna the blue / red asymmetry of the hco@xmath0",
    "@xmath7 @xmath8 10 transition increases by 22 per cent when the distance is decreased from 500 to 50pc , whereas that of the @xmath7 @xmath8 32 and 43 transitions decrease by @xmath3 12 and 29 per cent respectively ( for models with a @xmath24  temperature profile ) .",
    "a possible explanation for these trends may be that the low @xmath5510 line samples better the denser infall region of the core at smaller distances than farther away , whereas the opposite is true for the higher @xmath5532 , 43 lines which at small distances sample a very small fraction of the infall region ( less than five per cent of the region within the 0.03 pc radius of the collapse expansion wave ) .",
    "a similar variation in absolute values is seen when adopting a 15-m antenna , but in that case the asymmetry ratio of the 32 and 43 transitions is larger at 250pc .",
    "an intrinsic property of the inside - out model seems to be that for whatever the distance to a source of given density , a set of transitions can be found whose optimum combination of hpbw ( on a putative antenna ) , molecular tracer abundance , and line @xmath55 , would allow them to act as collapse chronometers .    in fig .",
    "12 we plot the hco@xmath0  10 and 32 spectra of a core for a number of assumed distances , whilst keeping the beam size fixed ( 45-m antenna ) .",
    "they are for a model with @xmath45 @xmath8 0.03pc and a constant molecular abundance .",
    "the peak line temperatures for models with a @xmath24  temperature distribution decrease linearly with distance ( apart from the 10 line whose peak temperature shows a faster decrease ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that at near distances the beam predominantly samples a denser portion of the core than at larger distances where a bigger volume of gas is sampled .",
    "also , at near distances the peak centroids are found at higher velocities as the beam samples a faster moving gas flow at the core s centre ; a similar result was reported by ward - thompson and buckley ( 2001 ) .",
    "the same comments apply in the case of a core with a @xmath23  temperature distribution .",
    "we conclude that distance uncertainties for a given core are likely to affect significantly the simulated line asymmetry ratios as these depend critically on the coupling between the hpbw of the transition probe and the size of the infall region .",
    "the @xmath7 @xmath8 10 transition of diazenilium has been modelled using only the molecular abundance from the chemical code as input to the rt code .",
    "the mean fractional abundance of n@xmath1h@xmath0  in the chemical model displays a range of @xmath3 1@xmath4210@xmath70 to 9@xmath4210@xmath70 in the timescales we considered ; this is in very good agreement to the range found for a large sample of ppcs in the perseus molecular cloud ( kirk , johnstone , & tafalla 2007 ) .",
    "we have not attempted to model the n@xmath1h@xmath0  hyperfine structure ( see pagani et al .",
    "2007 ) . in order to make our results more readily comparable to observations",
    "we have thus divided the molecular abundance corresponding to each collapse period by a factor of nine ; this would approximately reproduce the flux of the isolated ` blue ' hyperfine component @xmath71 @xmath8 0112 ( assuming that the hyperfine levels are populated in proportion to their statistical weights ) .",
    "this is usually better suited for analysis of infall candidates as it is mostly optically thin ( caselli et al . 1995 ; mardones et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the other components can suffer from overlap which occurs due to the large intrinsic linewidths in dense cores resulting from non - thermal motions and opacity broadening . the line is extensively used in studies of star - forming cores as the tracer whose largely single - peaked nature argues against interpretations other than infall when trying to explain the blue asymmetry exhibited by other tracers .    a graph of the evolution of the transition during the collapse of the core analogue is shown in fig .  4 ( bottom ) .",
    "the line appears single peaked and optically thin for both the @xmath23  and @xmath24  temperature profiles , but becomes double peaked during the last two collapse periods when its peak intensity has dropped to about 10 and 2 per cent of its initial value . as the line is still optically thin in the two right panels of fig .  4 ( bottom )",
    "the double peak is not produced by self - absorption but instead it directly traces the infall velocity structure of the core .",
    "a comparison of the model spectra with the ppc observations presented by lee et al .",
    "( 1999 ) shows very good agreement in terms of peak intensity and line width with the range detected in their sample for the isolated component . at @xmath44 @xmath8 1.36@xmath4210@xmath54 yr",
    "the line characteristics resemble those of l183b , while at 4.08@xmath4210@xmath54 yr the line looks very much like the one present in l492 ( cf .",
    "fig .  5 in lee et al .",
    ") . in the context of inside - out collapse ,",
    "the suitability of this line in the role of the optically thin tracer of infall ( except perhaps in advanced stages ) is re - affirmed by this work .      in this paragraph",
    "we comment on the effects of varying levels of internal turbulence on the simulated spectra of a _",
    "static _ core with a @xmath24temperature profile . by setting the infall velocity to zero in these models the effects of varying the turbulence",
    "are more readily observed .",
    "ward - thompson , hartmann and nutter ( 2005 ) have shown how increased levels of _ constant _ turbulent velocity dispersion , @xmath72 , throughout an infalling source lead to increased velocity separation of the line peaks .",
    "they reported peak velocity differences ( i.e. separation of the blue / red peaks ) of order @xmath73 @xmath3 12 km s@xmath10 when the turbulent velocity varied between 1/3.5 and 1.14 times the adopted sound speed , @xmath74 , in a collapsing cloud .",
    "we have investigated plausible _ monotonic variations _ of @xmath75 , increasing or decreasing with distance from the static core s centre .",
    "we found that when @xmath72 decreases outwards from subsonic values of 1.5@xmath46 to @xmath46 at the outer core radius ( where @xmath46 @xmath63 0.145 kms@xmath10 is our nominal turbulent velocity dispersion ) , this produces a peak velocity separation of 0.7 and 0.8 km s@xmath10 for the hco@xmath0  @xmath7 @xmath8 10 and 21 transitions respectively ( fig .  13 ) .",
    "when @xmath72 instead increased with radius by the same amount ( remaining subsonic ) , the peak velocity separation of the @xmath7 @xmath8 10 , 21 , and 32 lines was @xmath3 15 per cent smaller , while that of the 43 line changed by less than 10 per cent .",
    "higher @xmath7 lines were not self - absorbed and the full width at half maximum of the 54 line was 20 per cent larger in the ` decreasing ' compared to the ` increasing ' @xmath72 case ( for the same radiant line flux ) .",
    "the differences in the velocity separation of the line peaks that we found in these two simple examples are similar in magnitude to what one obtains if the optical depth of the lines are increased by a factor of @xmath32 as ward - thompson , hartmann and nutter report",
    ". however , this may be the case only for small @xmath72 variations , such as these in our example ; ward - thompson and buckley ( 2001 ) found that various power - law relations between @xmath72 and the gas density , encompassing a wider range than we have considered , have a more substantial effect on the peak velocity separation for the hco@xmath0  @xmath7 @xmath8 43 and cs @xmath7 @xmath8 54 lines .",
    "we also note that uncertainties in the distance to the source can mimic the effects on the peak velocity separation produced by the range of @xmath75 we have explored .",
    "the distance uncertainties to protostellar cores , however , do not usually exceed a factor of two and so the effects are probably separable .",
    "if one includes an analysis of optically thin lines as well , then the potential degeneracy between distance and turbulence effects can be avoided .",
    "supersonic turbulence in the outer parts of pre - stellar cores has been associated with outflows or with generic turbulence permeating from the parent molecular clouds .",
    "we have thus investigated an outward increase of turbulence to supersonic values at the edge of the core ( @xmath3 2@xmath74 ) , encompassing a factor of three variation from the inner to the outer radius .",
    "this is similar to that observed in the class  0 source ngc1333-iras4a ( belloche , hennebelle , & andr 2006 ) .",
    "the velocity separation of the peaks in this case ( fig .  13",
    "right ) is similar to what is obtained with a radially decreasing subsonic @xmath72 .",
    "this situation however is clearly distinguishable from the subsonic models as the total flux in the self - absorbed lines ( @xmath76 @xmath77 4 ) is lower . in the supersonic turbulence case ,",
    "the optical depth of the lines in the centre of the core _ relative to _ the outer regions is larger as increased levels of turbulence in the outer core result in lower optical depths ( as the optical depth is inversely proportional to the line width ; see also ward - thompson and buckley 2001 ) ; hence the emission in the self - absorption trough which is more weighted towards the inner core , is enhanced relative to that in the peaks .",
    "using a coupled chemodynamical and rt model we have conducted an exploratory study of the evolution of the spectral line characteristics ( intensities and asymmetries ) of molecular species such as hco@xmath0 , cs , and n@xmath1h@xmath0 , which are frequently used as tracers of collapse in star - formation studies .",

    "this rather crude comparison smoothes out the effects of different abundance distributions , but helps us to see that at early times hco@xmath0  is generally a more sensitive probe of collapse than cs ( at least in @xmath24  models ) , mainly because its higher excitation transitions resolve the infall region better than the respective cs lines . at later times the situation",
    "is mildly reversed ( for @xmath24 ) , mainly because cs 32 and 43 trace relatively better the low density infalling envelope .",
    "for both species the mean asymmetry is stronger in @xmath24  models than in @xmath23  models at the onset of infall , but this difference almost disappears later on .",
    "also , while for cs the line asymmetry increases on average from early to late times , the hco@xmath0  asymmetry for the @xmath24  models decreases on average in the same length of time .",
    "when different abundance distributions are considered then the picture becomes more complicated .",

    "show that if the molecular tracer s abundance increases towards large core radii then the lines can appear symmetric even at advanced stages of infall .",
    "this is mostly evident in models with a @xmath23temperature profile which are not conducive to large blue excesses in general and for which red asymmetry ratios can be obtained .",
    "conversely , a molecular abundance which declines with radius can result in high values of blue excess ",
    "this is particularly evident in the behaviour of some lines at early times . finally , a consequence of the specific chemical model used in this study is that the existence of high hco@xmath0/cs abundance ratios in the inner core contributes , at early collapse times , to a lower line asymmetry for cs than for hco@xmath0  lines .",
    "the main conclusions of this analysis of shu - type infall are :    \\1 .",
    "overall , hco@xmath0  is a somewhat better tracer of core collapse than cs , but this depends on the evolutionary state of the core , as there is a direct correspondence between the critical density of a particular transition and its ability to trace gas of given density and temperature ( with a significant excitation temperature and optical depth ) .",

    "infall ( in the absence of rotation ) the _ relative _ blue asymmetry of certain transitions is a function of the dynamical age ( for a given telescope ) , and acts as a ` collapse chronometer ' .",
    "this is mainly due to a combination of beam filling factors and line critical densities : a line of high critical density whose beamwidth efficiently resolves the infall region shows higher blue asymmetry at early collapse times than at later times when the gas density becomes too low ; the opposite is true for a line of low critical density whose large beamwidth can not adequately resolve the infall region at early times , but does so later on whilst remaining sufficiently opaque in the lower density conditions .",
    "the line asymmetry ratio is dependent on the abundance distribution of the molecular tracer in the source .",
    "the dependence naturally becomes stronger when the line beamwidth resolves the infall region well .",
    "detailed chemical models are therefore very important tools when attempting to interpret the observations .",
    "distance uncertainties of a factor of two or greater affect the line asymmetry ratio significantly .",
    "subsonic turbulence which monotonically decreases outwards from the core centre by a factor of 1.5 produces peak velocity separations in the hco@xmath010 , 21 lines of the order of @xmath31 km s@xmath10 .",
    "this is comparable to the peak velocity separations caused by an uncertainty estimate in the distance of a factor of five .",
    "a turbulence which increases with radius by a factor of 1.5 has a smaller effect on the peak velocity separation . turbulence which monotonically increases outwards to supersonic values , with a variation of a factor of three in the core , produces similar peak velocity separations to the subsonic decreasing case , but results in a much stronger self - absorption in the lines .    in the future we shall study the sensitivities of line profiles to the infall dynamics [ @xmath16 , in both the collapse and pre - collapse phases ] and the chemical and physical initial conditions .",
    "and although this work is of a general nature , the method of analysis and application can easily be adapted to model specific sources and instrumental configurations . concerning the latter",
