    "accordingly , we distinguish between the _ planar slope number _ of a planar graph @xmath4 , which is the smallest number of slopes needed to construct any straight - line embedding of @xmath4 , as opposed to the _ plane slope number _ of a plane graph  @xmath4 , which is the smallest number of slopes needed to realize the prescribed combinatorial embedding of @xmath4 as a straight - line embedding .",
