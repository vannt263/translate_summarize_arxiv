    "also the cosmic density of baryons @xmath19 has been very precisely determined through both the power spectrum of cosmic microwave background anisotropies and measurements of the primordial abundance of light elements ( cyburt et al .",
    "2001 ; olive 2002 ) .",
    "an important complementary information is that the density of baryons residing in virialized structures and associated to detectable emissions is much smaller than @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , traced - by - light baryons in stars and in cold gaseous disks of galaxies and in hot gas in clusters amount to a @xmath21 ( persic & salucci 1992 , fugukita et al .",
    "1998 , fukugita & peebles 2004 ) . on the other hand , in rich galaxy clusters the ratio between the mass of the dark matter ( dm ) component and the mass of the baryon component , mainly in the hot intergalactic gas , practically matches the cosmic ratio @xmath22 .",
    "the circumstance that @xmath20 is a factor of about 10 larger than @xmath23 puts forth both an observational and a theoretical problem .",
    "on one side , observations are needed to detect and locate these `` missing '' baryons ( see for a review stocke , penton & shull 2003 ) . on the theoretical side , galaxy formation models have to cope with the small amount of baryons presently in gas and stars inside galaxies .",
    "no doubt that feedback from stars and agns played a relevant role in unbinding large amounts of gas and eventually removing them from the host dm halo ( see , e.g. , dekel & silk 1986 ; silk & rees 1998 ; granato et al .",
    "2001 , 2004 ; hopkins et al . 2005 ; lapi , cavaliere & menci 2005 ) , but we need to get a detailed quantitative understanding of these processes , which are crucial to comprehend galaxy formation . the stellar feedback is expected to depend on the star formation history and the total energy released to the gas ultimately depends on the total mass of formed stars and on the present - day galaxy luminosity . correspondingly , the total energy injected by the agn feedback is ultimately related to the final black hole ( bh ) mass .",
    "the fraction of the gas removed by feedbacks is expected to depend also on the binding energy of the gas itself , which is determined by the galaxy _ virial _ mass and by its density distribution . therefore the relationships between the galaxy halo mass and the galaxy luminosity , the stellar and baryonic mass , the mass of the central bh , are expected to give extremely useful information on the process of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "an additional relevant piece of information is the link between the galaxy halo mass and the velocity dispersion of the old stellar component .",
    "this paper is devoted to a statistical study of these relations .",
    "the halo occupation distribution ( see , e.g. , kauffmann , nusser & steinmetz 1997 ; peacock & smith 2000 ; berlind & weinberg 2002 ; magliocchetti & porciani 2003 ) , which specifies the probability @xmath24 that a halo of mass @xmath25 is hosting @xmath26 galaxies , is a helpful statistics to establish the link between the host dm halo mass and the observed galaxy luminosity . an additional tool to explore this link is the formalism of the conditional luminosity function ( yang , mo & van den bosch 2003 ) , which describes how many galaxies of given luminosity reside in a halo of given mass . following this approach , yang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) investigated the relation between halo mass and luminosity .",
    "however , particularly for high halo masses , @xmath27 , both methods give information on galaxy systems , more than on large galaxies .",
    "marinoni & hudson ( 2002 ) and vale & ostriker ( 2004 ) suggest that a helpful starting point can be the simple hypothesis that there is a one - to - one , monotonic correspondence between halo mass and resident galaxy luminosity .",
    "then , by equating the integral number density of galaxies as a function of their luminosity and stellar mass to the number density of galaxy halos , one gets a statistical estimate of the dm halo mass associated to galaxies of fixed luminosity or fixed baryon / stellar mass . however , a major problem of the method is the estimate of the mass function of halos hosting one single galaxy , the galaxy halo mass function ( ghmf ) . to solve the problem , in this paper we use an empirical approach , which takes into account the results of numerical simulations ( see , e.g. , de lucia et al .",

    "the mass around a galaxy up to a radial distance from its center much larger than the characteristic scale of light distribution can be inferred from detailed x - ray observations ( see , e.g. , osullivan & ponman 2004 ) . also the statistical measurements of the shear induced by weak gravitational lensing around galaxies ( see bartelmann , king , & schneider 2001 ) yield important insights on the halo mass of galaxies ( mckay et al .",

    "one of the purposes of this paper is to show how the information coming from the relationships of the galaxy halo mass with measurable galaxy properties ( such as the stellar , baryonic and central bh masses ) can shed light on the role and on relative importance of the two feedbacks .",

    "its present form is the result of physical processes involving both baryons and dark matter . in particular , the lfs in the range between about 0.1 to several @xmath33 m probe the stellar component .",
    "the mass of stars and baryons associated to galaxies can be derived coupling the lf with estimates of the mass - to - light ratio ( mlr ) of the stellar and gaseous components .",

    "it is worth noticing that the determination of the mlr of low luminosity objects is hampered by many effects related to the episodic star formation history , to the presence of dust , to the irregularity of their shapes , and to the dm predominance .",

    "this mass density has been accumulated at high redshifts , @xmath86 , for early - type galaxies and later on for late - types , as indicated by their respective stellar populations .    by subtracting from the cosmic matter density the contribution of baryons ( @xmath87 ) and that of dark matter ( dm ) in groups and clusters of galaxies ( @xmath88 ; reiprich & bohringer 2002 ) , we obtain the dm mass density associated with galaxies @xmath89 , in excellent agreement with the determination by fukugita & peebles ( 2004 ) .",
