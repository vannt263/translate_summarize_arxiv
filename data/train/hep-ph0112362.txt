    "<S> we investigate the in - medium modification of the charmonium breakup processes due to the mott effect for light ( pi , rho ) and open - charm ( d , d * ) quark - antiquark bound states at the chiral / deconfinement phase transition . the mott effect for the d - mesons </S>",
    "<S> effectively reduces the threshold for charmonium breakup cross sections , which is suggested as an explanation of the anomalous @xmath0 suppression phenomenon in the na50 experiment . </S>",
    "<S> further implications of finite - temperature mesonic correlations for the hadronization of heavy flavors in heavy - ion collisions are discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 meson plays a key role in the experimental search for the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in heavy - ion collision experiments @xcite where an anomalous suppression of its production cross section relative to the drell - yan continuum as a function of the centrality of the collision has been found by the cern - na50 collaboration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an effect like this has been predicted to signal qgp formation @xcite as a consequence of the screening of color charges in a plasma in close analogy to the mott effect ( metal - insulator transition ) in dense electronic systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , a necessary condition to explain @xmath1 suppression in the static screening model is that a sufficiently large fraction of @xmath2 pairs after their creation have to traverse regions of qgp where the temperature ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> parton density ) has to exceed the mott temperature @xmath3 @xcite for a sufficiently long time interval @xmath4 , where @xmath5 mev is the critical phase transition temperature and @xmath6 fm / c is the @xmath1 formation time . within an alternative scenario @xcite , @xmath1 suppression does not require temperatures well above the deconfinement one but can occur already at @xmath7 due to impact collisions by quarks from the thermal medium . </S>",
    "<S> an important ingredient for this scenario is the lowering of the reaction threshold for string - flip processes which lead to open - charm meson formation and thus to @xmath1 suppression . </S>",
    "<S> this process has an analogue in the hadronic world , where e.g. @xmath8 could occur provided the reaction threshold of @xmath9 mev can be overcome by pion impact . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown recently @xcite that this process and its in - medium modification can play a key role in the understanding of anomalous @xmath1 suppression as a deconfinement signal . </S>",
    "<S> since at the deconfinement transition the @xmath10- mesons enter the continuum of unbound ( but strongly correlated ) quark- antiquark states ( mott- effect ) , the relevant threshold for charmonium breakup is lowered and the reaction rate for the process gets critically enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> thus a process which is negligible in the vacuum may give rise to additional ( anomalous ) @xmath1 suppression when conditions of the chiral/ deconfinement transition and @xmath10- meson mott effect are reached in a heavy - ion collision but the dissociation of the @xmath1 itself still needs impact to overcome the threshold which is still present but dramatically reduced .    for this alternative scenario as outlined in @xcite to work the @xmath1 breakup cross section by pion impact is required and its dependence on the masses of the final state @xmath10- mesons has to be calculated . </S>",
    "<S> both , nonrelativistic potential models @xcite and chiral lagrangian models @xcite have been employed to determine the cross section in the vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the latter models appear to be strongly dependent on the choice of formfactors for the meson - meson vertices . </S>",
    "<S> this is considered as a basic flaw of these approaches which could only be overcome when a more fundamental approach , e.g. from a quark model , can determine these input quantities of the chiral lagrangian approach . </S>",
    "<S> work in this direction is in progress , see @xcite , but meanwhile we have to rely on phenomenological approaches .     in the nonrelativistic quark exchange model @xcite ( symbols with error bars ) and in the chiral lagrangian model @xcite ( solid and dashed lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ jpsipics ] , height=302 ]    recently , a modified scheme for defining formfactors of meson - meson vertices has been suggested @xcite which uses gaussian functions instead of monopole ones @xcite and respects differences in the effective ranges of contact and meson exchange diagrams which arise from their quark substructure . the result is shown as the solid line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ jpsipics ] and compares well with that of the quark exchange model ( @xcite , filled circles ) in the peak value and position . </S>",
    "<S> the fast drop of the cross section above the threshold due to the behavior of the meson wave functions is described more appropriately by gaussian formfactors than by monopole ones , for details see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a change in the coupling constant of the contact term ( which corresponds to the capture diagrams in the quark exchange approach ) by a factor three leads only to a change in the total cross section by about 50 @xmath11 ( dashed line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ jpsipics ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the dominant contributions come from the meson exchange diagrams , which are related to the transfer diagrams of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> chiral lagrangian and quark exchange approaches to the hadronic interactions of charmonium can be brought to good agreement with each other .    since at the hadronization transition the @xmath1 is expected to be a true bound state with almost unchanged mass the most dramatic in - medium modification for @xmath1 breakup processes </S>",
    "<S> is expected due to the mott - effect for pions , rho- and d- mesons , i.e. their transition from bound states to resonant scattering states in the quark - antiquark continuum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> formally , this transition can be described by the behavior of the spectral function in corresponding channel . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the kinematics for processes involving heavy mesons is not constrained to their ( vacuum ) mass shell so that they become _ subthreshold_. the result of a model calculation which uses an off - shell extrapolation of the quark exchange cross section @xcite is given in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ barnes165 ] </S>",
    "<S> .     breakup cross section by pion impact due to the mott effect for open charm mesons at @xmath12 mev . </S>",
    "<S> [ barnes165 ] , height=321 ]    the corresponding reaction rate for @xmath1 dissociation shows a step function behavior at the mott ( hadronization ) transition @xcite which has earlier been postulated @xcite without a microscopic foundation for a successful description of the anomalous @xmath1 suppression pattern . </S>",
    "<S> the present approach is a relativistic formulation of string - flip processes which have been suggested for a unified description of @xmath1 suppression in hadronic as well as in quark matter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it predicts a simultaneus increase in the reaction rates for breakup of all hidden charm ( bottom ) states once the mott effect for the final state open charm ( bottom ) hadrons occurs . upon neglect of this trigger mechanism </S>",
    "<S> one would predict instead a sequential breakup of heavy quarkonia according to their different dissociation energies into the quark - antiquark continuum @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> applications to the description of charmonium production in nucleus - nucleus collisions are in progress @xcite .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that recent developments of the chiral lagrangian and quark exchange model appraches have lead to a convergence of results for quarkonium - hadron breakup ( string - flip ) cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> reaction rates for these processes are negligibly small in the hadronic world but show a critical enhancement at the deconfinement/ hadronization transition when the mott effect for open flavor hadrons is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> this reduces dramatically those reaction thresholds which would otherwise prevent heavy flavor equilibration in hadronic matter . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of the mott effect into the description of heavy flavor kinetics at the hadronization transition allows to link three recently observed phenomena : ( i ) anomalous @xmath1 suppression @xcite , ( ii ) open charm enhancement @xcite , and ( iii ) the success of the statistical model @xcite .    </S>",
