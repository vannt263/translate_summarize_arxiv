    "quantum phase transition ( qpt ) has been a hot topic in condensed matter physics over the years  @xcite .",
    "the existence of a qpt strongly influences the behavior of many - body systems near the critical point associated with the divergence of correlation length of two - point correlation functions and the vanishing of the gap in the exciton spectrum .",
    "qpts , which happen at very low temperature and are driven by pure quantum fluctuations , are a qualitative change in the ground state properties of a quantum many - body system as some external parameters of the hamiltonian are varied .",
    "recently , the jaynes - cummings - hubbard ( jch ) lattice  @xcite has been shown to display the quantum phase transition phenomenon  @xcite within the mean - field theory framework and verified by monte carlo simulations  @xcite . for large numbers of coupled cavity qed systems ,",
    "it should be possible to observe many - body effects such as quantum phase transition . a strong coupling theory for the jch lattice",
    "has also been developed  @xcite .",
    "the qpt of jch lattice is analogous to the insulator - superfluid transition of the bose - hubbard model which has been theoretically and experimentally demonstrated to be realizable in cold - atom optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of coupled cavity system is that each lattice can be easily addressed and the system parameters can be readily controlled because of their mesoscopic size .",
    "experimentally , the jch lattice is much easier to realize and more controllable than strongly correlated systems at the level of each individual elements , and is still able to simulate the behavior of such systems  @xcite , and can be realized using superconducting circuits  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the trace distance  @xcite has been shown to serve as a measure for the distinguishability of quantum states as well as the non - markovianity of quantum processes  @xcite and the witness for initial system - environment correlations in open - system dynamics  @xcite . moreover",
    ", the trace distance can be experimentally obtained using technologies such as quantum state tomography  @xcite .",
    "the trace distance between any two states is a direct measure of how far apart the two states are in the state space .",
    "therefore , the trace distance between a state and its factorized state defined as the tensor product of the system state and the environment state can serve as a measure of in - separateness or the correlation between the environment and system  @xcite . this approach , which compares a state and its factorized state is different from the fidelity approach which compares two ground states whose hamiltonian parameters are slightly varied . in this paper",
    "we extend the ground states to gibbs states and investigate the behavior of the trace distance and qpt of the jch lattice at finite temperatures .",
    "the system is defined to be all the atoms and the environment to be all the field modes in our coupled jaynes - cumming lattice .",
    "therefore , the trace distance between finite - temperature gibbs initial equilibrium state and the factorized state defined as the tensor product of the system state and the environment state is a measure of the correlation between all the atoms and all the field modes . at the critical points of the quantum phase transition , the structure of the ground state undergoes a radical change .",
    "just like the fidelity approach captures this radical change by calculating the inner product of two ground or gibbs states whose hamiltonian parameters are slightly varied , we expect the trace distance measure to be able to pinpoint the critical points of the quantum phase transition , and our approach is better suited for interacting atom - field systems . by making use of the analytical solution to the jch lattice of arbitrary size @xmath0 , we calculate the trace distance between the gibbs state and the product of its marginal states . at the critical points of the quantum phase transition , which are determined by the ground state energy level crossing",
    ", the trace distance shows a sudden jump at finite temperature , which means that the trace distance can be used to describe the critical points of qpt .",
    "the critical points are found to be dependent on the atom - field interaction strength and the detuning factor , from which we can obtain a phase diagram of the system .",
    "moreover , non - equilibrium states are also taken into consideration , and it is found that the time evolution of the trace distance s maximum value is also a good indicator of the critical points . finally , the scaling behavior of the system is found to exist for the first derivative of the trace distance at the critical points , and the scaling rule is shown to be dependent on the system parameters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_sys ]",
    "we give the energy spectrum and phase diagram of the jch lattice .",
    "the trace distance and the qpt behavior of the jch lattice is explored in section  [ sec_qpt ] .",
    "the trace distance of the gibbs equilibrium states for non - equilibrium time evolution is also studied . in section  [ sec_scal ] , the scaling behavior of the jch lattice",
    "is investigated .",
    "a conclusion of the paper is given in section  [ sec_con ] .",
    "+    the jch lattice describes a system of @xmath0 low - loss cavities that are coupled together which allows nearest - neighbor photon hopping .",
    "each low - loss cavity is modeled by the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian  @xcite which sustains a single mode field @xmath1 and contains a two - level atom of bohr frequency @xmath2 which couples to the field mode at rate @xmath3 ( see fig .  [ jchmod ] ) .",
    "the full hamiltonian reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hamiltonian describing the @xmath6-th jc cavity of the form @xmath7 and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the raising and lowering operators of the atom , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the creation and annihilation operators of the field mode and the interaction hamiltonian is of the form @xmath12 .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written in a decoupled form using the fourier transform .",
    "we can express the free - field hamiltonian @xmath13 in terms of normal modes as  @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 since the atom - photon interaction strengths , the cavity - mode and atomic frequencies are uniform through the cavity lattices , we can rewrite the hamiltonian in terms of @xmath0 decoupled effective jc models as @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the atomic lowering and raising operators after a similar transform .",
    "the hamiltonian now takes the form of @xmath0 uncoupled jc cavities with different , specific field mode frequencies . for the @xmath19-th effective jc cavity ,",
    "the eigenvectors are given by , in the basis @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the detuning of the @xmath19-th effective cavity .",

    "we can see from the figure that the drop of fidelity is less dramatic for higher temperatures.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    each ground state level crossing happens when two smallest eigen energies @xmath29 coincide . in fig .",

    "one of the advantages of our approach is that we do not require prior knowledge of the order parameters or the pattern of the symmetry breaking to study the quantum phase transition phenomenon .",
    "the different phases are represented in terms of different ground states , each region in the phase diagram has its own ground state wave function , and the quantum phase transition happens when the system parameter changes from one region to another . because of this ground state cross over , it is expected that the structure of the ground state undergoes a radical change when the quantum phase transition takes place . in order to compare our results with the fidelity approach",
    ", we explore the inner product or fidelity  @xcite of two ground states with slightly varied parameters and find that it suffers a sudden drop at the critical points of the qpt .",
    "we also calculate the fidelity at finite temperature .",

    "we can see from the figure that the drop of fidelity is less dramatic for higher temperatures , which is due to thermal fluctuations at higher temperatures .",
    "as different phases are represented in terms of different ground states , and each phase has a distinctive ground state wave function associated with it , it is expected that the expectation value of the total excitation number , the derivative of the ground state energy as well as the trace distance should show a discontinuity behavior along the critical points of the quantum phase transition , even at finite temperatures . to verify this",
    ", we first plot the expectation value of total excitation @xmath43 as a function of the atom - field coupling strength @xmath3 and the detuning @xmath25 near zero temperature @xmath44 and the derivative of the ground state @xmath45 against the atom - field coupling strength @xmath3 in fig .",

    "in this section , we investigate the trace distance and how to identify the qpt of the jch lattice using the trace distance .",

    "the distance of two trace class operators @xmath47 and @xmath48 is defined to be half the trace norm of @xmath49 . for density operators ,",
    "the trace distance can be further simplified as @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the eigenvalues of @xmath49 .",
    "the trace distance ranges from zero to one , with its being zero if and only if the two states are identical .",
    "it is also a metric on the space of physical states and is sub - additive with respect to the tensor product , @xmath52 we define the system to be all the atoms and the environment to be all field modes in our coupled jaynes - cumming lattice and consider the total initial thermal - equilibrium gibbs state @xmath53 where the inverse temperature @xmath38 , @xmath39 the boltzmann constant and @xmath54 is the partition function .",
    "we calculate the trace distance between the gibbs state and the product of its marginal states @xmath55 .",
    "the reduced density matrix reads @xmath56=\\sum_{f_i}\\langle f_i|\\rho_{se}|f_i\\rangle,\\\\ \\rho_e&=\\mathrm{tr}_s[\\rho_{se}]=\\sum_{a_i}\\langle a_i|\\rho_{se}|a_i\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 and @xmath58 means the partial trace and is carried out by tracing over all field modes @xmath59 to obtain the marginal for the atoms , and tracing over all possible combinations of atom states @xmath60 to obtain the marginals for the field modes .",
    "it is noted that @xmath61 and @xmath62 have the same marginals for the system and environment , @xmath63 = \\mathrm{tr}_{e(s)}[\\rho_s \\otimes \\rho_e]$ ] , so the difference between the two density matrices measured by the trace distance can capture the system - bath correlation between the generic thermal gibbs state of the global atoms plus fields system and the product of the marginals . with the full hamiltonian diagonalized in the previous section , we can compute the trace distance for any number of excitons without the mean - field approximation which requires taking the thermodynamics limit . for states containing at most @xmath0 excitons ,",
    "we first need to write down all the basis for the hilbert space so that the matrix form of the gibbs state density matrix along with the system and environment marginals can be obtained .",
