    "nucleus - nucleus collisions at relativistic energies aim at the study of the fundamental theory of the strong interaction , quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) , at extreme energy densities .",
    "the main goal of this physics program is the production and study under laboratory conditions of the plasma of quarks and gluons ( qgp ) .",
    "the qgp is a deconfined and chirally symmetric state of strongly interacting matter predicted by qcd calculations on the lattice  @xcite for values of the energy density five times larger than those found in the nuclear ground state , @xmath0 0.7 @xmath1 0.3 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "the combination of high center - of - mass energies and large nuclear systems in the initial - state of heavy - ion reactions provides , furthermore , favorable conditions for the study of the ( non - linear ) parton dynamics at small values of ( bjorken ) fractional momentum @xmath3 . in this regime ( often dubbed `` color glass condensate '' , cgc  @xcite ) , higher - twist effects are expected to saturate the rapidly increasing density of `` wee '' gluons observed at small-@xmath3 in the hadronic wave functions which would , otherwise , violate the unitarity limit of the theory .    in hadronic collisions",
    "the production of particles with high transverse momentum ( @xmath4 2 gev/@xmath5 ) results from hard parton - parton scattering processes with large momentum transfer @xmath6 and , as such , is directly connected to the fundamental ( quark and gluon ) degrees of freedom of qcd . since",
    "hard cross - sections can be theoretically computed by perturbative methods using the collinear factorization theorem  @xcite , inclusive high @xmath7 hadroproduction , jets , direct photons , and heavy flavors , have long been considered sensitive and well calibrated probes of the small - distance qcd phenomena .",
    "this paper reviews the most interesting results on transverse spectra from @xmath8 reactions at rhic collider energies ( @xmath9 = 200 gev ) in the high @xmath7 sector , where the production of hadrons in central collisions shows substantial differences compared to heavy - ion reactions at lower center - of - mass - energies ( @xmath10 20 gev ) as well as compared to more elementary reactions either in the `` vacuum '' ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) or in a cold nuclear matter environment ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "such differences are indicative of significant initial- and final- state effects and provide direct information on the properties of the qcd medium in which the hard scattering process has taken place .",
    "high @xmath7 production in proton - proton collisions provides the baseline `` free space '' reference to which one compares heavy - ion results in order to extract information about the qcd medium properties . at rhic , the differential cross - sections for @xmath14  @xcite and charged hadrons  @xcite above @xmath15 2 gev/@xmath5 measured in @xmath11 collisions at @xmath16 = 200 gev are well reproduced by standard next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) pqcd calculations ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this is at variance with measurements at lower center - of - mass energies ( @xmath17 65 gev , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , left ) where the @xmath18 5 gev/@xmath5 cross - sections in hadronic collisions at fixed - target and cern - isr collider energies are underpredicted  @xcite by pqcd calculations ( even supplemented with soft - gluon resummation corrections  @xcite ) , and additional non - perturbative effects ( e.g. intrinsic @xmath19  @xcite ) must be introduced to bring parton model analysis into agreement with data .",
    "hard production in @xmath11 collisions in the collider regime of rhic seems to be basically free of the `` distortive '' non - perturbative effects that are important at lower energies , and constitutes thus a experimentally and theoretically well calibrated baseline for heavy - ion studies .",
    "implicitly at the root of the qcd description of high @xmath7 particle production in hadronic collisions is the idea that the large-@xmath6 scattering between the two partons from each hadron is an _",
    "incoherent _ process .",
    "namely , that the characteristic time of the parton - parton interaction is much shorter than any long - distance interaction occurring before ( among partons belonging to the same hadronic wave function ) or after ( during the evolution of the struck partons into their hadronic final - state ) the hard collision itself .",
    "the `` factorization theorem ''  @xcite reflects this mutual independence of qcd dynamics at different time ( length ) scales : the inelastic cross - section for the production of a given hadron @xmath21 in a hard process , @xmath22 , is the ( factorized ) product of long - distance ( non - perturbative but universal parton distribution functions , @xmath23 , and fragmentation functions , @xmath24 ) and short - distance ( perturbatively computable parton - parton scattering ) contributions . in nucleus - nucleus reactions ,",
    "qcd factorization reads : @xmath25 since partons are effectively `` frozen '' during the hard scattering , one can treat each nucleus as a collection of free partons .",
    "thus , _ with regard to high @xmath7 production _ , the density of partons in a nucleus with atomic number @xmath26 should be equivalent to the superposition of @xmath26 independent nucleons : @xmath27 from ( [ eq : factor ] ) and ( [ eq : npdf ] ) it is clear that qcd factorization implies that hard inclusive cross - sections in a minimum - bias @xmath28 reaction scale simply as @xmath29 times the corresponding @xmath11 cross - sections : @xmath30 since nucleus - nucleus experiments usually measure invariant _ yields _ for a given centrality bin ( or impact parameter @xmath31 ) , one writes instead : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the glauber geometrical nuclear overlap function at @xmath31 , @xmath34 , is proportional to @xmath35 : @xmath36 , one also writes eq .",
    "( [ eq : tab_scaling ] ) as : @xmath37 . ] .",
    "one can thus quantify the medium effects on the production of a given particle at high @xmath38 via the _ nuclear modification factor _ : @xmath39 which measures the deviation of @xmath28 at @xmath31 from an incoherent superposition of nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath40 ) collisions , in terms of suppression ( @xmath411 ) or enhancement ( @xmath421 ) .",
    "one of the most interesting results at rhic so far is the _ breakdown _ of the expected incoherent parton scattering assumption for high @xmath38 production , eq .",
    "( [ eq : tab_scaling ] ) , observed in central @xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ fig : r_aa_pi0 ] shows @xmath43 as a function of @xmath7 for @xmath14 produced in nucleus - nucleus reactions at different center - of - mass energies .",
    "rhic data at 200 gev ( circles ) and 130 gev ( squares )  @xcite are noticeably below unity in contrast to the enhanced production observed in @xmath44 collisions at cern - isr  @xcite ( stars ) .",
    "this enhanced production , observed first in @xmath45 fixed - target experiments ( `` cronin effect '' )  @xcite , is interpreted in terms of multiple initial - state soft and semi - hard interactions which broaden the transverse momentum of the colliding partons prior to the hard scattering .",
    "the situation at cern - sps is not completely clear .",
    "whereas the original work  @xcite reported a strong cronin enhancement , a recent reanalysis using a better @xmath46 reference  @xcite shows that the 07% most central @xmath47 data is consistent with @xmath48 1 ( triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : r_aa_pi0 ] ) and that the production in head - on @xmath47 reactions ( 01% central ) is actually suppressed ( @xmath48 0.6 ) indicating that some amount of `` jet quenching '' may already be present at @xmath49 20 gev .",
    "a concurrent measurement at rhic of high @xmath7 hadron spectra in @xmath8 _ and _ @xmath11 collisions at these lower @xmath16 would definitely set the issue of the onset of the suppression in central @xmath20 reactions .",
    "the breakdown of the expectations from collinear factorization for high @xmath7 production in central @xmath8 collisions at rhic , has been interpreted as indicative of :    1 .",
    "strong * initial - state * effects : the parton distribution functions in the nuclei are strongly modified : @xmath50 in the relevant ( @xmath51 ) range , resulting in an effective reduction of the number of partonic scattering centers in the initial - state .",
    "strong * final - state * effects : the parton fragmentation functions ( or , more generally , any post hard collision effect on the scattered partons ) are strongly modified in the nuclear medium compared to free space .    explanation ( i ) is usually invoked in the context of the `` color - glass - condensate '' picture  @xcite which assumes that the kinematical conditions prevailing in the initial - state of an atomic nucleus boosted to rhic energies are such that nonlinear qcd effects ( @xmath52 processes , amplified by a @xmath53 factor compared to the proton case ) are important and lead to a saturation of the strongly rising small-@xmath3 gluon densities in the nuclei .",
    "leading - twist qcd factorization itself breaks down since the incoherence between long- and short - distance effects in which the product eq .",
    "( [ eq : factor ] ) relies upon , does not hold anymore .",
    "cgc calculations predict @xmath54 ( instead of @xmath55 ) scaling at moderately high @xmath7 s , as approximately observed in the data ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : r_aa_pi0 ] ) . explanation ( ii ) relies on the expectations of `` jet quenching ''  @xcite in a quark gluon plasma in which the hard scattered partons lose energy by final - state `` gluonstrahlung '' in the dense partonic system formed in the reaction . after traversing the medium , the partons fragment into high @xmath7 ( leading ) hadrons with a reduced energy compared to standard fragmentation in the `` vacuum '' .",
    "different jet quenching calculations can reproduce the magnitude of the @xmath14 suppression assuming the formation of a hot and dense system characterized by different , but closely related , properties  @xcite : i ) large initial gluon densities @xmath56 1100 , ii ) large `` transport coefficients '' @xmath57  3.5  gev/@xmath58 , iii ) high opacities @xmath59 3.5 , iv ) effective parton energy losses of the order of @xmath60  14 gev / fm , or v ) plasma temperatures of @xmath61 0.4 gev .",
    "another intriguing result of the rhic program is the different suppression pattern of baryons and mesons at moderately high @xmath38 .",
    "figure  [ fig : flavor_dep ] shows the @xmath55 scaled central to peripheral yield ratios ( inclusive and identified ) spectra scale with @xmath55 when compared to the @xmath11 yields , the ratio @xmath62 carries basically the same information as the nuclear modif .",
    "factor @xmath43 . ] , @xmath62 , for baryons ( left ) and mesons ( right ) . in the range",
    "@xmath15 2  4 gev/@xmath5 the ( anti)protons are not suppressed ( @xmath63 1 ) at variance with the pions which are reduced by a factor of 2  3 .",
    "the resulting baryon / meson@xmath640.8 ratio is clearly at odds with the `` perturbative '' @xmath640.2 ratio measured in @xmath11 or @xmath65 collisions .",
    "such a particle composition is inconsistent with standard fragmentation functions , and points to an additional non - perturbative mechanism for baryon production in central @xmath8 reactions in this intermediate @xmath7 range .    in the recombination picture",
    "@xcite , the quarks present in the dense environment coalesce and with the addition of their momenta , the soft production of baryons extends to larger @xmath38 values than that for mesons .",
    "beyond @xmath66 gev/@xmath5 fragmentation becomes the dominant production mechanism for all species .",
    "estimates of the formation time of the ( leading ) hadrons qualitatively support this scenario . a hard scattered parton with momentum @xmath67 = 3 ( 10 ) gev/@xmath5 hadronizes into a fully formed meson of radius @xmath68 0.8 fm in a time  @xcite @xmath69 10 ( 30 ) fm/@xmath5 .",
    "the total lifetime of the strongly interacting system produced in @xmath8 reactions is @xmath70 15 fm/@xmath5 as extracted from different experimental observables  @xcite .",
    "thus , partons with moderate energies ( leading to hadrons with @xmath15 2  4 gev/@xmath5 ) will not fragment in the vacuum , as do the more energetic ones , but in a environment where they can still recombine with other surrounding particles .",
    "hard scattering in lepton- and proton- ( or deuteron- ) nucleus collisions allows the study of the properties of the nuclear wave - function with minimal final - state distortions due to _ dense _ qcd medium effects . in 2003 , rhic run @xmath73 collisions as a `` control '' experiment in order to disentangle between the two different scenarios ( qgp and cgc ) proposed to explain the high @xmath7 deficit observed in central @xmath8 at mid - rapidity .      the results of high @xmath7 pion production at y = 0 in @xmath73 collisions at @xmath9 = 200  gev",
    "do not show any indication of suppression ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cronin_colda ] , left ) . on the contrary ,",
    "pion yields appear cronin enhanced ( @xmath74 1 ) compared to the expectations of collinear factorization left , that the cronin effect seems to disappear ( @xmath75 1 ) above @xmath15 8 gev/@xmath5 , a result found also in @xmath45 collisions at fixed - target energies  @xcite . ] .",
    "this result indicates , in a model - independent way , that the observed suppression in @xmath8 central collisions is not an initial - state effect arising from strong modifications of the gluon distribution function in nuclei as proposed by cgc approaches , but results instead from a final - state effect in the produced dense medium .",
    "the cronin enhancement is also observed above @xmath76 1 gev@xmath77 in the hermes and emc deep - inelastic `` hadron multiplicity ratio '' @xmath78 ( ratio of the number of hadrons of type @xmath21 produced per dis event on a nuclear target to that from a deuterium target ) for @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 nuclei  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cronin_colda ] , right ) .",
    "two points are worth noticing here : ( i ) at such relatively high values of @xmath82 , the exchanged virtual photon interacts directly with the _ partonic _ constituents of the nucleus , and ( ii ) any @xmath7 broadening is due to multiple scattering of the _ outgoing _ quark propagating inside the ( cold ) nuclear medium .",
    "thus , the observed cronin effect in lepton - nucleus collisions is due to _ final - state partonic _ multiple scattering .      in a sense ,",
    "the apparent absence of gluon saturation effects in hard @xmath73 cross - sections at @xmath83 = 0 at rhic is not completely surprising inasmuch as the kinematical range probed corresponds to relatively moderate values of bjorken @xmath84 10@xmath85 where standard dglap evolution describes well the dis data at hera .",
    "a simple way to probe smaller values of @xmath86 in the @xmath87 nucleus consists in looking at hadron production in the forward direction . since @xmath88 for a @xmath89 process",
    ", @xmath3 decreases by a factor of @xmath6410 for every 2-units of rapidity one moves away from @xmath83 = 0 .",
    "bramhs  @xcite and phenix  @xcite results on high @xmath7 charged hadron production at pseudorapidities @xmath90 = 3.2 and @xmath90 = 1.8 ( corresponding to @xmath91 @xmath92(10@xmath93 ) and @xmath92(10@xmath94 ) respectively ) show a suppression instead of an enhancement as found at @xmath90 = 0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rcp_brahms ] , left ) .",
    "interestingly , this is the first time that the nuclear pdfs are probed at such small values of @xmath3 in the _ perturbative _ domain ( @xmath95 1 gev@xmath77 ) ( fig .  [ fig : rcp_brahms ] right ) .",
    "brahms @xmath75 0.5 result seems to indicate that the ratio of @xmath87 over @xmath67 gluon densities is @xmath96 2 gev@xmath97 0.5 , whereas standard _ leading - twist _ dglap analysis of the nuclear pdfs ( based on global fits of the dis and drell - yan data above @xmath6 = 1 gev@xmath77 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rcp_brahms ] , right ) indicate a less significant amount of gluon `` shadowing '' in this range : @xmath98 0.8  @xcite . whether this larger suppression is due to soft physics ( the global @xmath99 distributions in lower energy @xmath45 collisions",
    "are also found to be depleted at forward @xmath90  @xcite ) or a genuine cgc effect , is still matter of discussion at this point .",
    "during its first four years of operation , rhic has provided many new and exciting results on the many - body dynamics of qcd at high energies .",
    "the suppressed high @xmath7 hadroproduction observed in central @xmath8 reactions and in @xmath73 collisions at forward - rapidities is inconsistent with the basic qcd factorization expectations that describe particle production in @xmath11 at @xmath16 = 200  gev .",
    "the factor of 45 suppression in central @xmath8 is unambiguously due to final - state effects ( since no such an effect is seen in @xmath73 collisions at @xmath83 = 0 ) and can be reproduced by calculations of parton energy loss in a strongly interacting medium with energy densities well above those where lattice qcd predicts a transition to a quark gluon plasma .",
    "the factor of @xmath642 deficit observed at @xmath100 3 in @xmath73 reactions may be the first empirical indication of higher - twist ( non - linear ) qcd effects at small bjorken-@xmath3 in the hadronic wave functions .",
