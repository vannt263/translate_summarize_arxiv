    "damped ly@xmath0 systems ( hereafter , dla ) are the primary tracers of metallicity over cosmological distances ( _ e.g. _ , lu  1996 ) and provide a method of identifying distant galaxies ( _ e.g. _ , giavalisco , steidel , and szalay 1994 ) .",
    "it is likely that these dla are associated with galaxies , but whether the lines arise in a rotating disk or in the halo remains a matter of controversy ( charlton and churchill 1996 ; prochaska and wolfe 1997 ; lu , sargent , and barlow 1997 ) .",
    "one reason for this uncertainty is that we possess little information on the cold gas content of these galaxies .",
    "velocity maps of the absorbing hosts would be very valuable in addressing this issue , but even the two previously known nearest dlas , at @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( petitjean  1996 ; lanzetta  1997 ) , are too distant for such observations to be feasible .",
    "another issue is the meaning of the measured abundances , which nominally indicate that the metallicities of dla are typically 10300 times below the solar value over redshifts of @xmath11 03 .",
    "( for higher redshifts , the metallicity appears to be even lower ; lu , sargent , and barlow 1998 . )",
    "however , low apparent abundances are also derived for sight lines out of the milky way , but in this case we know this is due to depletion onto grains ( _ e.g. _ , cardelli , sembach , and savage 1995 ; savage and sembach 1996 ) .",
    "unfortunately , depletion onto grains can raise a substantial uncertainty in the metallicity deduced from dlas .",
    "some insight into these issues is offered by our observations of a dla caused by a galaxy so nearby that some of the properties of its disk are already known . here",
    "we present ultraviolet resonance line observations that led to the discovery of a dla system toward the quasar ton 1480 ( @xmath12 ; @xmath13 ) , which lies behind the nearby galaxy ngc 4203 at a projected separation of only 1.9@xmath3  ( 12 @xmath4  kpc ) from the center .",
    "ngc 4203 is a nearby @xmath1  ) , bright @xmath14 early - type galaxy that is not in a cluster , has normal colors , with @xmath15 , and a one - dimensional velocity dispersion of 175 .",
    "the background quasar , ton 1480 , was discovered by us as part of a program whereby we use background x - ray sources to identify quasars near targets of interest , such as galaxies and galaxy clusters ( knezek and bregman 1998 ) .",
    "this galaxy has been observed in many wavebands , including an map ( van driel  1988 ) with both column density and velocity information for the neutral gas . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the absorption line observations , the column densities for fe , mg , and mn , the kinematics of the absorbing gas , and how this relates to the known kinematics of the gas .",
    "the data were taken in january 1997 with the faint object spectrograph aboard hst .",
    "the 1640 second exposure was taken through the 0.86@xmath16  aperture using the g270h grating and red digicon detector . in this configuration ,",
    "the expected fos instrumental line width ( fwhm ) is 1.97  , providing a spectral resolution of 211  at the @xmath172800 doublet .",
    "the wavelength coverage ranges from 2222 to 3277  , with a s / n ratio of about 20 throughout the spectrum",
    ".    visual inspection of the spectrum reveals several strong absorption features ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath172800 doublet from ngc 4203 can be seen shifted 10.8   ( 1160 ) from its galactic counterpart .",
    "the @xmath172600 line also can be seen shifted 10.1   ( 1165 ) from the galactic line .",
    "in general , lines with @xmath18   are easily visible to the eye .",
    "other such lines include @xmath172374 , @xmath172382 , as well as their corresponding galactic lines .",
    "to detect fainter absorption features , we utilized the line - searching software developed for the hst absorption line key project ( schneider  1993 ) .",
    "this algorithm performs both gaussian and psf fitting to absorption features across the spectrum , finding line centers and equivalent widths with errors .",
    "the detection threshold was set to 3-@xmath19 , which corresponds to a minimum equivalent width of 0.15 across most of the spectrum .",
    "the fitting procedure detected 20 lines ( see table [ tab : data ] ) ; of these , 7 are galactic in origin , 6 are from the dla , 3 are blends of milky way and dla lines , and 4 are unidentified . for a spectrum with 2064 resolution elements",
    ", we would expect roughly 1 spurious detection above the 3-@xmath19  limit .",
    "thus a few of the unknown lines , which are all near the 3-@xmath19  limit , could possibly be real lines ; however , they are inconsistent with any known atomic resonance lines , either galactic or at the velocity of ngc 4203 .",
    "it remains to be seen if they are real absorption lines from intervening material between the quasar and ngc 4203 .",
    "we identified weak lines in , , and at the redshift of ngc 4203 , as well as the easily visible lines mentioned above .",
    "all identified dla lines are listed in table [ tab : data ] which gives the vacuum rest wavelength , line center , and equivalent width with 1-@xmath19  errors .",
    "analysis of the galactic features sheds some light on the quality of the hst / fos wavelength calibration . at the high galactic latitude of ton 1480 ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 )",
    ", the galactic ism should be nearly at rest relative to the heliocentric velocity .",
    "thus any galactic line should be barely shifted from its rest wavelength in the direction of ton 1480 .    to determine the average expected shift in the milky way lines , we calculated a weighted mean line - of - sight velocity for the disk ,    @xmath22    integrating out to @xmath23 pc . using the estimate of the density @xmath24-dependence from dickey and lockman ( 1990 ) and the standard equation for differential galactic rotation , @xmath25 \\sin{l } \\cos{b}$ ]",
    ", we find @xmath26  , only 2% of our spectral resolution .    from the fos calibrated ( vacuum ) wavelengths ,",
    "the average shift of the clean galactic features is @xmath27  .",
    "this corresponds to a shift of @xmath28  at 2800  , much larger than the expected shift found above .",
    "thus the fos wavelength calibration is off by about 1.2   to the blue .",
    "this is within the pointing error for a fos binary target acquisition ; in addition , it has been found recently that the zero - point of the fos wavelength scale varied considerably over the lifetime of the instrument ( keyes 1998 ) . since we did not obtain a lamp spectrum at the time of the observation but instead relied on the default calibration used in the hst pipeline ,",
    "our wavelength calibration could indeed be off by this amount .",
    "2.65truein    0.1truein    consequently , we used the galactic lines ( plus the 4  offset ) as the fiducial zero velocity .",
    "the velocity shifts in all dla lines from the galactic zero - point are given in table [ tab : data ] .",
    "( for display purposes , all wavelength measurements have been shifted 1.2   to the red . )",
    "the average line shift for the unblended lines is @xmath29  from the galactic reference lines , implying a heliocentric velocity of @xmath30  .",
    "as mentioned earlier , several absorption lines are blended with milky way features .",
    "the @xmath172374 , @xmath172587 and @xmath172577 lines are all blended with galactic lines .",
    "this line is the only line of this element detected , so only an upper limit can be obtained for its abundance .",
    "for fe , three lines ( @xmath172344 , @xmath172383 , and @xmath172600 ) were cleanly detected .",
    "additionally , non - detections of two lines and three lines provide upper limits for their equivalent widths .",
    "finally , we have detected three mg lines in two stages of ionization , the @xmath172800 doublet and @xmath172853 . the doublet is clean and pronounced while the line is weak and appears broadened .",
    "it also has an anomalous velocity , shifted 75  from the mean determined above .",
    "it is possible this line is blended , although there are no strong galactic features in this region of the spectrum .",
    "thus its nature remains questionable , and we treat it only as an upper limit .",

    "column densities can be determined for weak ( optically thin ) lines by using the relation ( _ e.g. _ , spitzer 1978 ) :      the unblended lines are all thin lines , since the value of @xmath53 scales linearly with the oscillator strength , @xmath54 ( taken from morton 1991 ) .",
    "the @xmath172800 doublet lines appear to be on the doppler portion of the curve of growth , since the line strength does not scale as the oscillator strength .",
    "since we have two lines , we can simply take the line ratio , and we find that @xmath55 in the thin - line limit , we would expect the line ratio to be @xmath56 so these lines are indeed optically thick , and we can only obtain a lower limit to the column density .",
    "the and lines are probably thin , but it is problematic to determine column densities without more lines from these species .    column densities and 1-@xmath19  errors for each line are given in table [ tab : data ] . for lines which were not detected , a 3-@xmath19  upper limit to the equivalent width",
    "can be determined from consideration of the detection threshold and noise . assuming the lines are weak",
    ", these values represent an upper limit to the column density .    to obtain the abundance of an element relative to solar , an accurate measurement of the column",
    "is needed .",
    "for this system , there are several possible methods .",
    "van driel  ( 1988 ) used 21-cm observations , finding an column of about @xmath57  @xmath35 towards ton 1480 .",
    "a more accurate estimate comes from x - ray absorption observations .",
    "the x - ray absorption column toward ton 1480 was determined for the _ rosat pspc _ data , which yielded a value of 3.38@xmath58@xmath35 ( bregman , hogg , and roberts 1995 ) , while the galactic column in this direction is only 1.14@xmath58  @xmath35 ( hartmann and burton 1997 ) .",
    "since the value of the galactic column is the same as the galactic x - ray absorption column ( arabadjis and bregman 1998 , and references therein ) , we attribute the excess absorption column to that of the disk of ngc 4203 , which leads to a value of @xmath59@xmath35 . to further constrain this value ,",
    "ly@xmath0 observations are planned for hst in the near future .    to obtain the total elemental abundance ,",
    "we need to know the column density in each stage of ionization .",
    "we are severely limited since we have detected only one ionization stage for two of the three elements .",
    "thus we need to model the ionization structure to correct for this .",
    "the ionization model in this region of ngc 4203 was produced using cloudy ( ferland et al.1998 ) .",
    "two different ionizing spectra ( ikeuchi and ostriker 1986 ; haardt and madau 1996 ) were tested , along with the two values for the column  given above . for most of our lines ,",
    "there is little difference in the ionization among the four models . and account for @xmath60 5% and @xmath60 90% of the fe in each model , respectively .",
    "the fractional ionization of mg is @xmath60 1020%  and @xmath60 7075% .",
    "it should be noted that adjusting  by a factor of 2 makes less of a difference than changing the spectrum of the ionizing radiation .",
    "this is especially true for , where the difference between the two model spectra is a factor of 2 in the fractional ionization .",
    "we used the spectrum from figure 5a of haardt and madau ( 1996 ) , normalized to @xmath61(912  ) @xmath62  ergs @xmath35 s@xmath63 hz@xmath63 sr@xmath63 ( dove and shull 1994 ) , and the x - ray column of @xmath59@xmath35 . the model gives the following ionization fractions : = 0.038 , = 0.942 , = 0.117 , = 0.764 , and = 0.635 .",
    "the relative column densities for and are consistent with this model . however , according to our data @xmath64 , whereas our model predicts it to be 0.15 .",
    "it appears the ionization in this region is higher than our model predicts ; this is especially likely given the anomalous velocity of the line , which could indicate that the and absorbers are not co - spatial .",
    "earlier results indicate that ionization correction factors for and may be insignificant for this observed column density ( viegas 1995 ; prochaska and wolfe 1996 ) .",
    "we find our data to be consistent with these results , and so we will not apply any ionization correction to these species for the following analysis .",
    "the column densities listed in table [ tab : data ] give the following results for the heavy element abundances , relative to the solar values of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 ( anders and grevesse 1989 ) :      these values are significantly below the expected stellar metallicity , although it is difficult to separate true underabundances from depletion onto grains since each of these elements have high condensation temperatures .",
    "a comparison between the known velocity of the disk with the absorption line velocities can help us understand the nature of the absorption site .",
    "van driel s ( 1988 ) velocity maps give an velocity of 1170  along this line of sight in ngc 4203 .",
    "from the centers of the unblended and absorption lines , the average heliocentric velocity is found to be 1160 @xmath8 10 .",
    "this is indistinguishable from the value , clearly demonstrating that the absorption is due to a galactic disk of gas .",
    "limits can also be placed on the internal motions of the absorbing gas .",
    "the widths of the strongest lines average to @xmath72 fwhm , with an instrumental line width of 241 , which sets an upper limit to the velocity dispersion of 224  at the 99% confidence level . for , the constraint is stricter , with an average width of @xmath73  fwhm and an instrumental profile of 210  yielding a maximum velocity dispersion of 167  at 99% confidence .    in the future , we hope to use this unique system to pursue additional issues of dlas .",
    "a planned hst observation with stis should determine whether high ionization state gas is present , permit column densities to be measured for other species , and provide a third measure of the column .",
    "higher spectral resolution studies will be able to examine the velocity structure of the absorbing material .",
    "finally , the intrinsic metallicity of the system can be studied through optical observations of regions and by x - ray studies .",
    "we would like to thank j. bergeron , j. charlton , d. schneider , c. cowley , e. schulman , and the staff at stsci for their advice and assistance .",
