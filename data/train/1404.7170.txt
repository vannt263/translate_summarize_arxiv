    "identifying mesoscopic structures and their relation to the function of a system in biological , social and infrastructural networks is one of the main challenges for complex networks analysis @xcite . until recently , most approaches focused on static network representations , although in truth most systems of interests are inherently dynamical @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical progresses and the availability of data inspired a few innovative methods , which mostly revolve around unfolded static representations of a temporal dynamics @xcite , constraints on the community structure of consecutive graph snapshots @xcite or on global approaches @xcite .",

    "+ inspired by the notion of _ stability _",
    "@xcite , we propose a related measure , _ temporal stability _ , which naturally embeds the time - dependence and order of interactions between the constituents of the system .",
    "temporal stability allows not only to compare the goodness of partitions over specific time scales , as its static counterpart , but also to _ find _ the best partition at any time and over any time scale . in the following , we briefly review the main ingredients of static stability and introduce their natural extensions to temporal networks .",
    "we then present a benchmark model as a proof of principle , and then analyse two real - world datasets , finding pertinent mesoscopic structures at different time - scales .",
    "like the map equation @xcite , stability exploits the properties of the stationary distribution random walkers exploring a static network and of long persistent flows on a network .",
    "while the map equation relies on finding the most compressed description of a random walker trajectory in terms of its asymptotic distribution , the intuition behind stability is that walkers exploring the network will tend to stay longer in a well defined cluster before escaping to explore the rest of the network .",
    "the object of interest is thus the auto - covariance matrix of an unbiased random walk on a network @xmath0 for a given partition @xmath1 , i.e. the higher the autocorrelation , the better the description of a system in terms of modules by @xmath1 .",
    "after @xmath2 markov time - steps of exploration of the network by the random walkers , it can be compactly written as : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the partition matrix assigning nodes to communities , @xmath5 the transition matrix of the random walk on @xmath0 , @xmath6 its stationary distribution and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 term can be interpreted as a null model that represents the asymptotic modular structure against which the structure unveiled by the random walkers exploration of the network is tested .",
    "the stability of partition @xmath1 at markov time @xmath2 is then defined by : @xmath9 the magnitude of the trace of the autocovariance matrix represents the extent to which walkers are confined within the clusters defined by @xmath1 .",
    "the minimum over the markov time during which the walkers were allowed to move ensures that the measure conservative .",
    "the value of @xmath2 at which a given partition becomes optimal conveys information about which topological scales of the network are best described by the partition considered .",

    "this is especially clear in the time period corresponding to the lunch break , where children are allowed to mingle more freely in the school s cafeteria",
    ". +    .8     0.8     * international trade network . *",
    "the dataset consists of trade flows between states for the years 1870 - 2009 ( v3.0 ) and is publicly available from the correlates of war website at http://www.correlatesofwar.org/ @xcite .",
    "we focused on the dyadic trade network , where each link represents the trade flow between pairs of states in current u.s .",
    "the full networks is therefore weighted and directed .",
    "the activity driven model that we are using as null model however produces binary undirected networks .",
    "therefore , in order to make the comparison meaningful , we extracted the backbone of the network using the disparity filter @xcite with a significance threshold of @xmath120 , then we symmetrised the network and from there calculated the activity values needed to define the activity driven model .",
    "in this section , we illustrate the difference between temporal stability and other temporal partition methods , and focus on multislice modularity @xcite optimised with the genlouvain algorithm .",
    "the main difference between these two methods is how time is treated .",
    "the approach in @xcite is a modularity one .",
    "they follow the exposition of @xcite construct their generalised modularity on an expansion of the exponential in the laplacian dynamics for small time .",
    "the dynamics they consider on the network is thus effectively a `` one - step '' dynamics .",
    "the time dependence of the system is encoded in the multislice structure as a coupling parameter between the slices which mimics temporal ( cor)relation between snapshots .",
    "time is therefore introduced as a topological construct . in contrast , in our approach , we consider the complete dynamics seen by a random walk co - evolving with the network itself , thus embedding the time - evolution of the system in its the description , making it also parameter free .",
    "the two approaches are therefore not only conceptually but also practically different .",
    "one has a one time - scale constraint , while the other has access to and uses all time - scales .",
    "+ as an example , we applied the genlouvain algorithm on the three datasets considered in this paper .",
    "we used the code available at http://netwiki.amath.unc.edu/genlouvain/genlouvain .",
    "we calculated the best partitions according to the multislice modularity for various values of the parameter @xmath29 ( which encodes the interlayer connection strength ) .",
    "the multislice modularity in general finds a small number of different clusters which change and evolve over time .",
    "the closest analog for the temporal stability case is the partition obtained for @xmath61 , as this describes the temporal dynamics when considering only successive layers .",
    "we find marked differences between the stability values obtained by the multislice modularity partitions and the optimal stability ones ( fig .",
    "[ fig::two_block_comparison_genlouvain_stability ] , [ fig::sociopattern_comparison_genlouvain_stability ] and [ fig::cow_comparison_genlouvain_stability ] ) .",
    "in addition to this , it is easy to see from figures [ fig::two_blockcomparison ] , [ fig::sociopattern_comparison ] and [ fig::cow_genlouvain_partition_zoomin ] that the results of the two methods differ significantly .",
    "multislice modularity produces larger and persistent communities over time due to the extra structure that it introduces in the network by the interlayer couplings , which effectively mixes time and space in the network in an unfolded static topology .",
    "the coupling parameter therefore stiffens the community structure by imposing ( arbitrarily ) stronger connection between time slices , resulting in a smaller number of communities with increasing @xmath29 the results for optimal stability at @xmath61 highlight on the contrary changes in the network as seen from a walker co - evolving with the network .",
    "this can be seen very clearly in the case of the two - block model and of the international trade network . in the former ,",
    "multislice modularity yields few ( 3 - 4 ) communities which do not change over time significantly , while the temporal stability at @xmath61 yields a temporal partition that picks up with remarkable accuracy the cycles of the model . in the latter",
    ", the sparsity of links during the early years of the international trade network yields partitions mostly constituted by single - node or very small communities . while the progressive integration of the trade network is evident in both methods ( a decreasing number of communities with time ( fig .",
    "[ fig::cow_genlouvain_partition_0_2_trade ] , [ fig::cow_genlouvain_partition_0_5_trade ] and [ fig::cow_genlouvain_partition_0_8_trade ] ) , optimal temporal stability for small @xmath2 is able to pick up distinctive , rapid changes in the network structure ( e.g. the two world wars ) , as opposed to multislice modularity .",
    "so even when only considering as a naive heuristic as the number of communities , the advantage in uncovering rapid changes in the temporal structure that temporal stability has over the multislice modularity is evident .",
    "+ in the light of these observations , we can conclude that the two methods provide two different and complementary lenses to study a given system ; one strongly focused on the static persistent topological structure of the network , the other on dynamics .",
    "it is also worse reminded the reader that by changing @xmath2 , one changes the time - scale at which one is probing the community structure evolution .",
    "for example , micro - communities best describe the two - block model for @xmath61 as the model is rather sparse over short time - scales .",
    "then , by increasing @xmath2 , one sees the existence of the two - blocks , together with the shocks of the mixing ; this effect is shown in the main text in the variation of information graphs ."
