    "ground - state ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) hydroxyl ( oh ) masers were first discovered towards several galactic hiiregions ( e.g. w3(oh ) ) by @xcite and @xcite . since their discovery , extensive work on ground - state oh masers",
    "has shown that they are commonly associated with regions of high - mass star formation ( hmsf ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and these masers are predominantly strong in main - line transitions ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) ( i.e. 1665mhz and 1667mhz ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite compiled a catalog of @xmath8375 ground - state oh maser sites associated with hmsf from the literature , representing an up to date compilation of this category of sources .",
    "ground - state oh masers are also detected towards circumstellar envelopes of evolved giant and supergaint stars , such as miras and oh / ir stars ( @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and are typically dominated by emission from the 1612 mhz satellite line ( i.e. @xmath9 , 1612mhz ; @xcite ) .",
    "the maser emission in the 1720mhz satellite - line transition ( @xmath10 ) , is usually associated with supernova remnants ( snrs ) ( @xcite ) and traces the interaction between snrs and surrounding dense molecular clouds .",
    "ground - state oh masers are also found associated with planetary nebulae ( pn ; @xcite ) , comets @xcite and the centres of active galaxies @xcite .",
    "previous work on ground - state oh masers has targeted regions likely to have maser emission , such as infrared astronomical satellite ( _ iras _ ) point sources with infrared ( ir ) colors indicative of high - mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) @xcite , circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars with h@xmath11oand / or sio masers @xcite and snrs @xcite .",
    "about 30 years ago , a single - dish blind survey of oh main - line transitions was carried out toward a thin strip of the southern galactic plane between galactic longitudes 233@xmath12through the galactic center to 60@xmath12and galactic latitudes within @xmath130.5@xmath12(@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite also carried out a systematic survey close to the galactic plane with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) in the main - line transitions .",
    "however , these observations have favoured hmsf regions because only main - line transitions were observed . @xcite ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) used the atca and very large array ( vla ) to survey the 1612mhz oh line towards a large portion of the galactic plane , between galactic longitudes of 315@xmath12and 45@xmath12and galactic latitudes of @xmath143@xmath12and @xmath153@xmath12 .",
    "the survey of @xcite observed only the 1612mhz oh line and was thus heavily favoured towards detecting evolved star oh masers .",
    "therefore , these previous surveys suffer from biases ( e.g. towards hmsf regions or evolved star sites ) and thus the full population of each type of astrophysical object mentioned above may not be comprehensively studied .",
    "although it is clear that ground - state oh masers are detected towards different types of astrophysical objects ( hmsf regions , the envelopes of evolved stars , snrs ) , the proportion of masers associated with each kind of object remains unknown .",
    "studying the proportion will yield a better understanding of the ground - state oh maser populations and characteristics of their associated astrophysical objects .    in order to reduce biases caused by targeted surveys or surveys only observing specific ground - state oh transitions , the southern parkes large - area survey in hydroxyl ( splash )",
    "was carried out with simultaneous observations of all four ground - state transitions .",
    "splash surveyed 176 square degrees of the southern galactic plane and galactic centre ( @xcite ) , i.e. between galactic longitudes of 332@xmath12and 10@xmath12and galactic latitudes of @xmath142@xmath12and @xmath152@xmath12(152 square degrees ) , plus an extra region around the galactic centre , where coverage was extended up to galactic latitudes @xmath156@xmath12for galactic longitudes 358@xmath12to 4@xmath12(24 square degrees ) .",
    "unsurprisingly , the survey has detected about 600 sites exhibiting oh maser emission .",
    "the observations were conducted with the australia telescope national facility ( atnf ) parkes 64-m telescope and achieved a mean rms ( root - mean - square ) point - source sensitivity of @xmath865 mjy in each 0.18 kms@xmath16channel in maser - optimised cubes , but were limited by the spatial resolution ( about 13@xmath17 ) .",
    "this spatial resolution is insufficient to reliably identify the astrophysical objects associated with the maser emission .",
    "therefore , higher spatial resolution observations are needed , which is the motivation for this work .",
    "the majority of oh masers detected in splash are in the 1612mhz satellite - line transition and show a double - horned spectral profile .",
    "these masers are evolved star oh masers , which also occasionally exhibit detections in the 1665 and/or 1667mhz main - line transitions .",
    "oh masers usually have many spectral features in the main - line transitions .",
    "each spectral feature corresponds to one maser spot on the sky , which is usually considered to arise in a single , well - defined position @xcite .",
    "star formation oh masers preferentially trace a later stage of the hmsf process , compared to methanol masers and water masers ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "as mentioned above , oh masers in the 1720mhz transition are quite rare and are commonly associated with shocked gas , which can be detected in snrs ( @xcite ) , hmsf regions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , occasionally asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars @xcite and pne @xcite .",
    "this paper presents accurate positions of ground - state oh masers , which are obtained from atca observations , in the pilot region of splash between galactic longitudes of 334@xmath12and 344@xmath12and galactic latitudes of @xmath142@xmath12and @xmath152@xmath12 .",
    "observations were conducted with the atca from 2013 october 24 to 2013 october 29 and 2015 january 27 , using the 6a configuration . at the frequency of the ground - state",
    "oh masers , the 6a array results in a synthesised beam between 4.07@xmath18 and 5.50@xmath19 .",
    "observational pointing centres were determined based on the parkes oh maser detections introduced in @xcite . for masers within one field of view , we chose the pointing centre between them ; if the masers were previously observed by the mapping the galactic magnetic field through oh masers ( magmo ; @xcite ) project , we obtained their accurate positions directly from the magmo project ( green , j. private communication ) .",
    "we do not include the magmo data in the results presented here and only use them to study the detection statistics .",
    "each region was typically observed with five 6 min snapshot observations for a total on - source integration time of 30 min .",
    "primary flux calibration was performed with the standard flux density calibrator pks b1934@xmath14638 and bandpass calibration with pks b0823@xmath14500 .",
    "phase calibrators were chosen to be within 7@xmath12of each target and the phase calibrators were monitored about every 20 min .",
    "the compact array broadband backend was used to collect data , using the cfb 1m-0.5k mode with 16 zoom bands , each with 2048 channels over 1mhz giving 0.5 khz channel spacings , with all four polarisation products .",
    "an analysis of the polarization properties of the masers , including the identification of zeeman pairs , will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the setup included 3 concatenated zoom bands at each of the 1612 and 1720mhz maser transitions , 5 concatenated zoom bands covering the 1665 and 1667mhz transitions and 3 concatenated zoom bands at the transition .",
    "the channel separation is 0.09 kms@xmath16 .",
    "edge channels were masked out during the data reduction process . since",
    "our observations were targeted towards single - dish maser detections , we know the velocity range of most of the maser emission expected in each source . the velocity coverage over which maser emission was searched for each transition was approximately @xmath14250 to + 210 kms@xmath16for 1612mhz , @xmath14210 to + 140 kms@xmath16for 1665/7mhz and @xmath14180 to + 250 kms@xmath16for 1720mhz in the local standard of rest ( lsr ) reference frame .",
    "the mean rms sensitivity of the atca observations is @xmath865 mjy in each 0.09 kms@xmath16channel .",
    "the sensitivity of the atca observations is approximately the same as the original splash survey , but with a factor of two higher velocity resolution .",
    "the miriadtask * uvlin * was adopted to subtract the continuum emission .",
    "the data were then reduced using miriadstandard data reduction routines to produce cleaned and restored data cubes , which were also corrected for the primary beam response ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cubes were then searched ( over the area of the primary beam ) for maser emission . in order to manage the large volume of data and search masers within a reasonable amount of time , the following method ( similar to @xcite )",
    "was used to search for masers :    1 .",
    "the full data cube was binned in ten velocity channels ( after binning , the channel width becomes 0.9 kms@xmath16 ) to maximise the sensitivity to maser spots that have a typical oh maser line - width ( based on the parkes splash spectra ; @xcite ) .",
    "a peak - intensity map ( in miriada moment @xmath142 map ) was formed from the whole binned cube .",
    "the peak - intensity map was visually inspected for bright spots , which are the signatures of masers .",
    "any maser candidate found in the peak - intensity maps was then verified in the full data cube .",
    "our observations resulted in sparse sampling of the uv - plane , which , when combined with very bright maser spots , resulted in side - lobe artefacts in the peak intensity maps .",
    "these can be distinguished from real maser spots by visually checking their appearance in the full data cube .",
    "a real maser spot will typically be seen as the brightest feature in multiple contiguous channels .",
    "5 .   for channel ranges",
    "excluding the maser emission , binned peak - intensity maps were created to check if there were other weak masers .",
    "the above manual method of searching for and characterising features is at least as accurate as an automated method ( @xcite , @xcite ) . after identifying maser spots ,",
    "their positions are determined in the following steps .",
    "an integrated intensity map ( in miriada moment 0 map ) is created with the unbinned channels over which the maser spot is detected .",
    "this integrated intensity map has the highest signal - to - noise ratio for that maser spot and therefore exhibits the most accurate position .",
    "if two maser spots are overlapping in velocity , we identify their positions by only integrating over velocities where the maser spot in question dominates the flux density .",
    "the miriadtask * imfit * is used to fit the integrated intensity map and obtain both the position and relative uncertainty in the position of the maser spot .",
    "the peak velocity and peak flux density of a maser spot are determined from the spectrum , extracted at the position of the maser spot using miriadtask * uvspec*. the integrated flux density is also calculated using the spectrum of the maser spot ( see section [ images ] for more details ) .",
    "we used a systematic approach to determine the velocity range for each maser spot : in order to improve the s / n of the spectra , we averaged the data by binning five channels to give a velocity resolution of about 0.45 kms@xmath16 .",
    "we calculated the rms noise ( 1-@xmath20 ) of the binned data and identify the velocity range as those channels with flux density in excess of 3-@xmath20 .",
    "in addition , we excluded any part of the spectrum with noise . where spectra appear to show two overlapping velocity components with a trough between them",
    ", we classify each peak as a separate spot if the difference in flux density between the peak of the weaker line and the lowest point of the trough is greater than the 1-@xmath20 noise on the data .",
    "this method includes most emission from maser spots , but at the same time does not include weak emission from channels such that the noise may dominate in that velocity range",
    ". however , this method is not perfect and so the derived velocity ranges and integrated intensities are intended to be used as a guide .",
    "this is particularly the case when two maser spots are blended in both velocity and position .",
    "the absolute uncertainty in maser positions depends on the phase noise during the observations , which is related to the distance between the phase calibrator and the target region and the accuracy of the known locations of the phase calibrators , the locations of the antennas , as well as the atmospheric conditions .",
    "a typical value of 1@xmath21 for the absolute positional uncertainty is adopted .",
    "this number is based on previous oh maser surveys with the atca by @xcite , who found absolute positional uncertainties of oh masers were better than 1@xmath21 .",
    "the relative positional uncertainty between maser spots detected in the same field of view can be more accurate than the absolute uncertainty .",
    "the 1-@xmath20  relative positional uncertainty is approximately @xmath22 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath23 is the convolved size of the source ( i.e. , the beam size in the case of point sources , such as masers ) .",
    "this allows us to compare the distributions of maser spots within a site on smaller scales than the absolute uncertainty , but does not allow us to compare the relative positions of maser spots with other data sets ( e.g. ir survey : glimpse , wise ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; as described below ) to better than 1@xmath21 .",
    "given that there are very few detections of 1720mhz masers , we have used that band to investigate the continuum emission associated with star formation oh masers .",
    "we concatenated 3 zoom bands at this frequency which resulted in a bandwidth of 2mhz .",
    "the data were reduced using standard techniques for atca continuum data , resulting in a typical rms noise of 5 mjy .",
    "the results are detailed in section [ starformation ] .",
    "in the splash pilot region , of the 196 pointing centres identified in the parkes observations of @xcite ( @xcite ) , 175 are detected with maser emission from our dataset and the magmo dataset .",
    "we did not detect any maser emission toward 21 positions , which are discussed in more detail in section [ non - detection ] . from our dataset and the magmo dataset",
    ", we detect 700 maser spots .",
    "the strongest flux density is 114 jy and the weakest is 0.17 jy .",
    "maser spots have been grouped into maser sites based on their separations .",
    "the size of maser sites is discussed in section [ size ] .",
    "we identify a total of 215 maser sites , 111 of which are newly detected . among these 215 maser sites ,",
    "162 maser sites are from our observations and 53 maser sites are from the magmo data .",
    "details of these 53 magmo maser sites will be published later by the magmo team .",
    "we include these 53 magmo maser sites for statistical purposes only .",
    "of these 215 maser sites , 154 show maser emission at 1612mhz , 61 have maser emission at 1665mhz , 57 show maser emission at 1667mhz and 9 show maser emission at 1720mhz .",
    "the 162 maser sites , which are obtained from our observations , are detailed in table [ maintable ] . in column 1",
    ", we assign a name for each maser spot , based on the galactic coordinates of their accurate positions and the frequency ( 1612 , 1665 , 1667 , 1720mhz ) plus a letter to identify the maser spots within the same maser site . for each frequency , letters are assigned sequentially , based on their peak velocities ( from low to high ) .",

    "the double - horned profile in the 1612mhz transition , combined with a bright ir stellar - like source in the glimpse or wise map as in figure [ figs1 ] , is a reliable indicator of an evolved star .",
    "however , for other maser sites , there may not be very clear evidence about their associations .",

    "the process of identifying the associations is in the following steps :    1 .",
    "an oh maser site was classified as a star formation site if its position is close to a class ii methanol maser site .",
    "we compared our oh masers to the methanol multibeam survey detections for this region ( mmb ; @xcite ) in galactic coordinates .",
    "the absolute positional accuracy of the mmb survey is about 0.4@xmath21 . when there is a 0.001@xmath12difference in one coordinate ( galactic longitude or galactic latitude ) , it is equivalent to an angular separation of 3.6@xmath21 .",
    "we chose 3.6@xmath21 as the maximum separation for ease of use .",
    "we find oh maser sites and methanol maser sites are either closely associated ( the separation is less than 3.6@xmath21 ) or well separated ( the separation is larger than 12.9@xmath21 ) .",
    "remaining maser sites were correlated with the h@xmath27o southern galactic plane survey ( hops ; @xcite ) identifications , which classified 22ghz water masers carefully and reliably .",
    "the absolute positional accuracy of hops is about 1 .",
    "the largest distance for an association is chosen to be 3.6@xmath21 , which is the same value used in mmb data .",
    "the comparison result also shows that oh maser sites and water maser sites are either closely associated ( the separation is smaller than 3.6@xmath21 ) or well separated ( the separation is larger than 12.9@xmath21 ) .",
    "remaining maser sites were compared with the red msx source ( rms ; @xcite ) catalogue .",
    "an association threshold of 9.5@xmath21 was adopted , corresponding to the astrometry limits of the rms survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "the oh maser site was assigned to the rms identification if the separation was smaller than this value .",
    "the remaining sources were identified in the literature with simbad .",
    "some sources with rms identifications ( e.g. pn and snr ) were also searched in simbad to confirm the identification or revise the identification .",
    "the associations could also be identified according to their ir properties or ir properties combined with spectral features .",
    "the ir images of all maser sites were checked to see if their identifications from the previous steps were correct .",
    "we also tried to classify some sources which did not have a clear identification based on steps 1@xmath144 .",
    "when masers have double - horned profiles in the 1612mhz transition and are associated with bright ir stellar - like sources in the glimpse or wise images , we classified them as evolved star oh masers .",
    "if masers were associated with extended green objects ( egos ; @xcite ) in the ir image , they were categorised as star formation",
    "oh masers , because egos trace the energetic shocked gas in the interstellar medium , which is the signature of star formation ( e.g. @xcite ) . with this step",
    ", we could identify many evolved star oh masers and check identifications from above steps , e.g. hops and rms , to obtain a correct identification . 6 .",
    "any oh masers which could not be reliably identified using the preceding steps were assigned as unknown sites .    from both our dataset and the magmo dataset",
    ", we identify 122 oh maser sites ( 57 percent ) associated with the circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars ( one of which is a pn ) , 64 oh maser sites ( 30 percent ) associated with sfrs , two maser sites towards snrs and 27 unknown maser sites ( 13 percent ) .",
    "compared to the literature ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , about half of the evolved star sites ( 60/122 ) are new detections , 39 percent of the star formation sites ( 25/64 ) are new detections and almost all of the unknown maser sites ( 26/27 ) are new detections .",
    "the identification result above demonstrates that the majority of oh masers originate from the envelopes of evolved stars .",
    "we will discuss the transition overlap of the evolved star category and star formation category separately in more detail in section [ overlap ] .",
    "the only pn site ( g336.644@xmath140.695 ; in the evolved star category ) has 1612 , 1667 and 1720mhz oh masers and shows variability in the 1720mhz transition at two epochs ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the two snr sites ( g336.961@xmath140.111 , @xcite , from magmo ; g337.802@xmath140.053 , @xcite , from our dataset ) show single - peak 1720mhz oh masers , which trace the interaction of the snr and surrounding molecular clouds .",
    "the unknown oh maser sites usually have one maser spot at 1612mhz and are associated with a bright ir stellar - like source in the glimpse or wise image ( 20/27 ) .",
    "these oh masers may come from the circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars where only one maser spot at 1612mhz can be seen .",
    "in order to classify maser spots into maser sites , and thereby determine the upper limit of oh maser site sizes , we have studied the angular separation between each maser spot and its nearest neighbour .",
    "figure [ dis_spot ] shows that the nearest neighbours are generally located within 2@xmath21 of one another .",
    "this figure further shows that few spots are separated by values in the range between 2@xmath21 and 4@xmath21 ( a total of five ) .",
    "given that figure [ dis_spot ] plots the separation to the nearest spot ( and therefore could be considered a lower limit to site size ) we have adopted a site size upper limit of 4@xmath21 .",
    "we note that this is the same upper limit adopted for the water masers detected in the hops survey ( @xcite ) . after establishing an upper limit , the true size of the maser sites",
    "can be determined by taking the maximum separation between oh maser spots within that site . in a few cases , we found maser spots spread over more than 4@xmath21 , but upon inspection were clearly two clusters of spots that were well separated and",
    "could therefore be easily classified into two separate sites .",
    "figure [ size_all ] shows the size of 171",
    "oh maser sites ( red ) and indicates that all of our oh maser sites are smaller than 3.1@xmath21 , and only eight sources show spreads of equal to or greater than 2@xmath21 ( equating to 95 percent of sources ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the majority of oh masers show extents of less than 2@xmath21 ( equivalent to a linear size of about 0.05 pc at a distance of 5 kpc ) which is consistent with previous investigations ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ".    for comparison , figure [ size_all ] also shows the site sizes of the 470 22ghz water maser sites ( blue ) from hops .",
    "this shows that the distribution of water maser sizes peaks at a smaller size than oh maser sites , but has a longer tail with more water maser sites showing larger sizes . the result of a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test shows that there is a @xmath28 percent chance these two distributions are drawn from the same underlying population .",
    "the significant difference in distributions of oh maser sites compared to water maser sites can be accounted for by the fact that very small water maser sites are dominated by evolved star masers ( @xcite ) , which are found in the inner envelopes compared to oh masers that are associated with the outer envelopes ( @xcite ) , causing there to be comparatively few very small oh masers . at the other end of the scale ,",
    "there are more large water maser sites which are dominated by star formation sources ( @xcite ) that often trace larger - scale outflows emanating from their powering sources , which may cause the wider range of water maser site sizes .",
    "figure [ size_es_sf ] shows oh maser site sizes for sources associated with evolved stars ( 117 maser sites ) and star formation ( 51 maser sites ) , respectively .",
    "it can be seen from the plot that evolved star sites are all smaller than 1.6@xmath21 , while the 12 oh maser sites that show greater extents are all associated with star formation , and , further , that the distribution of the evolved star sites peaks at smaller sizes than the star formation sites .",
    "the significance of these differences is confirmed with a k - s test of the two distributions , showing that there is a @xmath29 percent chance they are drawn from the same underlying population .",
    "it is perhaps not surprising that evolved star oh maser sites generally tend to be smaller because they are located in a circumstellar shell , typically on size scales of 80 au ( @xcite ) , whereas star formation oh maser sites are typically distributed over 3000 au ( @xcite ) .",

    "72 percent of 1665mhz oh masers ( 26/36 ) have a 1667mhz counterpart .",
