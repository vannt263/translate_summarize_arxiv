    "in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulator ( ti ) , a band inversion due to strong spin - orbit coupling induces gapless surface states ( ss ) consisting of spin helical dirac fermions,@xcite which are expected to give rise to a number of topological quantum phenomena .",
    "@xcite whereas such surface sensitive probes as angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and scanning tunneling microscope have been successfully applied to investigate the topological ss,@xcite the transport study of the ss remains a challenge due to the presence of parallel bulk conducting channel that usually dominates the transport properties.@xcite recently , the ternary tetradymite bi@xmath0te@xmath0se ( bts ) has become a prototype ti material for studying the peculiar spin and charge transport of the ss,@xcite because carefully prepared bts crystals not only present a very low bulk conduction , but also show clear shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations that reflect a high mobility of surface dirac electrons .",
    "given the lack of a truly bulk - insulating state in any of the known ti materials so far,@xcite further improvement of bts is worth pursuing .",
    "the first synthesis of bts was made while optimizing the continuous solid solutions between bi@xmath0te@xmath9 and bi@xmath0se@xmath9 for thermoelectric applications.@xcite nevertheless , unlike other members in the bi@xmath0te@xmath10se@xmath2 ( 0@xmath11@xmath4@xmath113 ) family , the te and se atoms in bts occupy distinct crystallographic sites , forming quintuple layers arranged in the sequential order te - bi - se - bi - te along the @xmath12 axis.@xcite such chalcogen ordering is believed to provide structural basis for reducing bulk carriers and achieving high surface mobility.@xcite unfortunately , similar to bi@xmath0se@xmath9 , the bts crystals grown from the stoichiometric melts show @xmath5-type metallic conduction with the electron density @xmath13 of @xmath1410@xmath15 @xmath16.@xcite when the chalcogen stoichiometry is altered in the starting composition , one obtains@xcite metallic or insulating crystals at different positions along the boule , which is due to the inevitable phase separation during the solidification process , according to a newly established phase diagram of the bi@xmath0te@xmath9bi@xmath0se@xmath9 system.@xcite therefore , it is desirable to explore an alternative route to obtain bts crystals with a large bulk resistivity while keeping the chalcogen stoichiometry , which would be useful for achieving a high surface - carrier mobility .    in this paper , we show that the above objective can be accomplished by hole doping through a bi - site substitution , which has already been proven to be effective in tuning the carrier type and density for both of the binary end members , bi@xmath0te@xmath9 and bi@xmath0se@xmath9.@xcite it is found that , in analogy to its role in bi@xmath0te@xmath9,@xcite the group iv element sn acts as an acceptor in bts , which allows us to tune the fermi level ( @xmath17 ) of this material . in particular , the bi@xmath1sn@xmath2te@xmath0se crystals with @xmath4 @xmath6 0.004 show low - temperature resistivity reaching several @xmath7 cm , indicating that @xmath17 is tuned into the bulk band gap ; their transport properties at high temperatures signify a large activation gap , which probably comes from a sn - related impurity band . in about a half of those samples ,",
    "we observed sdh oscillations originating from the topological surface state below 14 t. our analysis of the sdh oscillations gives direct evidence that one can achieve a surface - dominated transport in a bulk sn - doped bts crystal with a thickness of several @xmath8 m .",
    "the single crystals of bi@xmath1sn@xmath2te@xmath0se were grown by melting high purity elemental shots of bi ( 99.9999% ) , sn ( 99.99% ) , te ( 99.9999% ) , and se ( 99.999% ) with a nominal ratio of bi : sn : te : se = ( 2-@xmath4):@xmath4:2:1 ( @xmath4 = 0 , 0.002 , 0.004 , 0.006 , 0.01 , 0.02 ) in sealed evacuated quartz tubes at 850 @xmath18c for 48 h with periodically shaking to ensure homogeneity , followed by cooling slowly to 500 @xmath18c and then annealing at that temperature for 4 days . the resulting crystals are easily cleaved along the ( 111 ) plane , revealing a shiny mirrorlike surface . the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) analysis , which was performed on powders obtained by crushing the crystals , confirmed the samples to be single phase with chalcogen - ordered tetradymite structure .    for transport characterizations ,",
    "the crystals were cut into bar - shaped samples with the typical thickness of 100 @xmath8 m after they were checked to be single domain by x - ray laue analysis .",
    "the electrical leads were attached to the samples using room - temperature - cured silver paste in a six - probe configuration .",
    "the in - plane resistivity @xmath19 and the hall coefficient @xmath20 were measured in a quantum design physical properties measurement system ( ppms-9 ) down to 1.8 k. the magnetic field was applied along the @xmath21 axis which is perpendicular to the cleaved surface . for each @xmath4 value , the data were taken on several crystals obtained from different parts of the boule in order to check for sample - to - sample variation .",
    "in addition , selected samples were cleaved down to a few micrometers by using kapton tapes and then brought to a 14-t magnet for the detection of sdh oscillations using an ac measurement technique , in which two lock - in amplifiers were employed to collect the signals in both the longitudinal ( @xmath19 ) and transverse ( @xmath22 ) channels simultaneously .",
    "the measurements were carried out by sweeping the magnetic field between @xmath2314 t at the rate of 0.3 t / min , during which the temperature was stabilized to within @xmath235 mk .",

    "firstly , in the high - temperature region , @xmath19 in sn - doped bts samples increases more steeply with decreasing temperature , as can be seen more clearly in the arrhenius plot shown in fig .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath19 at room temperature in sn - doped bts samples varies from 80 to 110 m@xmath7 cm , which are considerably larger than that in bts@xmath25.@xcite also , the high - temperature slope in the arrhenius plot , which is almost doping independent , corresponds to an activation gap @xmath29 of approximately 120 mev ; this is nearly three times larger than that found for the bts@xmath25 sample ( @xmath29 @xmath30 45 mev ) .",
    "secondly , in the low temperature region , while @xmath27 of the bts@xmath25 sample becomes nearly flat , the sn - doped bts samples show a more strongly temperature - dependent @xmath27 behavior with a weak upturn below @xmath1410 k , whose origin is not clear at present .",

    "@xcite showed the simplest pattern of the oscillations . in the following , we present the analysis of this simplest case .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows the magnetic - field dependence of the transverse conductivity @xmath46 of this sample at 1.6 k , which was calculated from @xmath19 and @xmath22 .",
    "sdh oscillations are already visible in the raw data for magnetic field above 10 t. after removing a smooth background , one can clearly see that the oscillatory part of @xmath56 , @xmath29@xmath46 , exhibits periodic maxima and minima as a function of @xmath57 [ fig .",

    "from the linear fitting of the data with the slope fixed at the oscillation frequency obtained from the fourier transform ( @xmath49 = 116 t ) , we obtain a finite intercept @xmath50 = 0.4 @xmath23 0.1 .",
    "since the slope is fixed in this analysis , the error in @xmath50 is relatively small ; the main source of the error is the uncertainty in determining the positions of maxima and minima in the data shown in the inset of fig .",
    "3(a ) , and the error of @xmath230.1 in @xmath50 is a conservative estimate .",
    "the obtained @xmath50 of 0.4 @xmath23 0.1 is reasonably close to the value @xmath50 = 0.5 expected for massless dirac fermions , which points to the topological ss origin of the sdh oscillations . using the onsager relation @xmath49 = ( @xmath58@xmath12/2@xmath59e)@xmath60 , where @xmath60 is the extremal fs cross - section area",

    "3(c ) ] , we obtained the cyclotron mass @xmath53 = 0.13@xmath54 , where @xmath54 is the free electron mass . once @xmath53 is known , the dingle plot [ fig .",
    "3(c ) ] gives the dingle temperature @xmath52 = 12.5 k , which corresponds to the surface quantum mobility @xmath70 of @xmath141300 @xmath71/vs .",
    "this @xmath70 value is roughly twice as large as that reported for thick bts@xmath25 samples.@xcite surprisingly , according to these results , the ratio of the estimated surface conductance to the total conductance , given by @xmath72 , is calculated to be about 1.8 in this sample ; here , the surface sheet conductance @xmath73 @xmath30 5.8 @xmath26",
    "10@xmath74 @xmath75 , the measured overall conductivity @xmath76 was 0.64 @xmath75@xmath63 at 1.6 k , and @xmath55 = 6 @xmath8m.@xcite obviously , it is unphysical to have @xmath77 1 , and this result implies that the actual surface transport is hindered by steps between terraces created upon cleaving , giving the effective surface conductance that is smaller than the intrinsic one given by @xmath78 and @xmath79 . note that a similar problem was reported in ref . .",
    "in any case , the sdh oscillations give direct estimate of the surface transport parameters , which indicate that a surface - dominated transport can be achieved in sn - doped bts crystals with several @xmath8 m thickness .",

    "10@xmath65 and 3.2 @xmath26 10@xmath65 @xmath66 , respectively . unfortunately , as was pointed out in ref .",
    ", the multi - component nature of the oscillations prevents us from reliably extracting the cyclotron mass or the dingle temperature for each component .",
    "also , the landau - level fan diagram is not very reliable for extracting @xmath50 in the multi - component case .",
    "from the above results , it is clear that sn acts as an acceptor in bts .",
    "ideally , one would expect that the total number of holes introduced by sn doping , @xmath29@xmath35 , increases linearly with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "2(d ) , @xmath29@xmath35 becomes nearly constant for @xmath4 @xmath6 0.004 , which deviates significantly from the ideal situation .",
    "therefore , there must be some additional effects that lead to deactivation of sn dopants . in this respect ,",
    "a similar problem was noted in previous studies of sn doping in bi@xmath0te@xmath9 , @xcite and two possibilities have been proposed to explain the apparent discrepancy .",
    "one possibility considered for bi@xmath0te@xmath9 is that a part of the sn atoms are built into the lattice in such a way that a seven - layer lamellar structure , @xmath84 te - bi - te - sn - te - bi - te , is formed.@xcite if a similar structure exists in sn - doped bts as well , it would be se - bi - te - sn - te - bi - se .",
    "it is important to note that , in contrast to those occupying the bi site , the sn atoms in this structure do not bring any charge to the lattice , and thus the discrepancy is reconciled .",
    "however , no additional diffraction peaks except for those corresponding to the chalcogen - ordered tetradymite structure were observed in the xrd data even for the sample with the highest sn - doping concentration ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the seven - layer lamellae , if exist , are randomly distributed in the lattice .",
    "another , more plausible possibility is that , at high sn - doping concentration , the wavefunctions of the sn acceptors overlap significantly , leading to the formation of an impurity band ( ib).@xcite within this picture , increasing sn content results in an increase in the density of states ( dos ) of the ib instead of hole doping . in sn - doped bi@xmath0te@xmath9 , this sn - related ib",
    "was shown to be located at 15 mev below the top of the upper valence band.@xcite however , in the case of sn - doped bts , this sn - related ib is most likely located within the bulk band gap , because the activation energy was found to be much larger in sn - doped bts than in bts@xmath25 , which naturally points to the appearance of a new ib to pin the chemical potential in sn - doped bts .",
    "note that , while there may also be ibs due to se vacancies and bi / te antisite defects in sn - doped bts , it is most likely that @xmath17 is pinned to the sn - related ib due to its large dos .",
    "the fact that the activation energy of @xmath14120 mev is essentially unchanged for a range of sn concentrations ( @xmath4 = 0.0040.02 ) is also consistent with this picture .",
    "further studies are called for to clarify the details of the ibs in sn - doped bts .",
    "we performed a systematic study of the transport properties of a series of bi@xmath1sn@xmath2te@xmath0se single crystals with 0 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath3 0.02 .",
    "it is found that sn behaves as an acceptor , which enables us to tune the fermi level that is located in the conduction band in the undoped stoichiometric compound . for @xmath6 0.004 ,",
    "@xmath17 is successfully tuned into the bulk band gap , and the resistivity becomes as large as several @xmath7 cm at low temperatures .",
    "the transport properties at high temperatures show a thermally activated behavior with a large activation gap , which is probably related to the formation of a sn - related impurity band .",
    "the analysis of the sdh oscillations observed in a 6-@xmath8 m thick sample indicates that a surface - dominated transport can be achieved in sn - doped bts single crystals with several @xmath8 m thickness .",
