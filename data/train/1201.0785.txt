    "recently the lhcb collaboration has reported a result of a nonzero value for the difference between the time - integrated asymmetries of the decays @xmath3 and @xmath9 @xcite a_cpa_cp(k^+k^-)-a_cp(^+^-)=-(0.820.210.11)% based on 0.62 fb@xmath10 of 2011 data .",
    "the significance of the measured deviation from zero is 3.5@xmath11 .",
    "however , based on a data sample corresponding to the integrated luminosity of @xmath12 fb@xmath10 , the cdf collaboration @xcite obtained @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and hence a_cp=-(0.460.310.11)%  .",
    "the time - integrated asymmetry can be written to first order as a_cp(f)=a_cp^dir(f)+t a_cp^ind  , where @xmath15 is the direct asymmetry , @xmath16 is the indirect asymmetry , @xmath17 is the average decay time in the sample and @xmath18 is the @xmath19 lifetime .",
    "a global fit to the data of @xmath20 is consistent with no violation only at 0.128% cl @xcite .",
    "the central values and @xmath21 errors for the individual parameters are : @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    whether the first evidence of violation in the charm sector observed by lhcb is consistent with the standard model ( sm ) or implies new physics will require further analysis of more data and improved theoretical understanding .",
    "for some early and recent theoretical studies , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is known that in order to induce direct violation , one needs at least two distinct decay amplitudes with non - trivial strong and weak phase differences . in @xmath24 physics , there exist several qcd - inspired approaches describing the nonleptonic @xmath24 decays , such as qcd factorization ( qcdf ) @xcite , pqcd @xcite and soft collinear effective theory @xcite .",
    "even so , one needs to consider @xmath25 power corrections in order to explain the observed direct asymmetries in @xmath24 decays .",
    "for example , in qcdf it is necessary to take into account two different types of power correction effects in order to resolve the puzzles and rate deficit problems with penguin - dominated two - body decays of @xmath24 mesons and color - suppressed tree - dominated @xmath26 and @xmath27 modes : penguin annihilation and soft corrections to the color - suppressed tree amplitude @xcite .",
    "the situation is far worse in the charm sector as a theoretical description of the underlying mechanism for exclusive hadronic @xmath28 decays based on qcd is still not yet available .",
    "this is because the mass of the charmed quark , being of order 1.5 gev , is not heavy enough to allow for a sensible heavy quark expansion .",
    "indeed , it does not make too much sense to generalize the qcdf and pqcd approaches to charm decays as the @xmath29 power corrections are so large that the heavy quark expansion is beyond control . in short",
    ", there is no reliable model which allows us to estimate the phases and magnitudes of the decay amplitudes beyond the color - allowed tree amplitude .",
    "luckily , we do have a powerful tool which provides a model - independent analysis of the charmed meson decays based on symmetry , namely , the diagrammatic approach . in this approach",
    ", the flavor - flow diagrams are classified according to the topologies of weak interactions with all strong interaction effects included .",
    "based on flavor su(3 ) symmetry , this model - independent analysis enables us to extract the topological amplitudes and probe the relative importance of different underlying decay mechanisms .",
    "it is complementary to the factorization approaches .",
    "analysis based on the flavor - diagram approach indicates a sizable weak annihilation ( @xmath30-exchange or @xmath30-annihilation ) topological amplitude with a large strong phase relative to the tree amplitude . since weak annihilation and final - state interactions ( fsi s ) are both of order @xmath29 in the heavy quark limit , this means fsi s could play an essential role in charm decays .",
    "indeed , weak annihilation contributions arise mainly from final - state rescattering , and this explains why an approach based on heavy quark expansion in @xmath29 is not suitable for charm decays .",
    "the great merit and the strong point of the topological - diagram approach is that the magnitude and the relative strong phase of each individual topological tree amplitude in charm decays can be extracted from the data .",
    "decays where one has to make additional assumptions in order to extract individual topological amplitude cleanly from the data .",
    "] this allows us to calculate asymmetry at tree level in a reliable way , granting us an idea about the size of violation in charmed meson decays .",
    "since there is no tree - level direct violation in @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays , the observation of @xmath20 by lhcb indicates that , contrary to the conventional wisdom , penguin diagrams in singly cabibbo - suppressed ( scs ) decay channels do play a crucial role for violation even though they may not affect the branching fractions .",
    "indeed , this observation is quite natural in the topological approach since , just as the enhancement in weak annihilation diagrams through fsi s , weak penguin annihilation ( more specifically , the qcd - penguin exchange diagram to be introduced in the next section ) also receives contributions from the color - allowed tree amplitude followed by final - state rescattering .",
    "the time - integrated asymmetry receives indirect -violating contributions denoted by @xmath16 through the @xmath19-@xmath31 mixing .",
    "such a mixing is governed by the mixing parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the mass eigenstates @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respective masses and decay widths and @xmath38 is the average decay width .",
    "it is known that the short - distance contribution to the mixing parameters is very small @xcite , of order @xmath39 .",
    "on the theoretical side , there are two approaches : the inclusive one relying on the @xmath29 expansion ( see _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent study ) , and the exclusive one with all final states summed over . in ref .",
    "@xcite , only the su(3 ) breaking effect in phase space was considered for the estimate of @xmath40 .",
    "consequently , the previous estimate of mixing parameters is subject to larger uncertainties .",
    "we believe that a better approach is to concentrate on two - body decays and rely more on data than on theory .",
    "this is because the measured two - body decays account for about 75% of hadronic rates of the @xmath28 mesons . for @xmath41 and @xmath42 modes , data with good precision for",
    "cabibbo - favored ( cf ) and scs decays are now available . for as - yet unmeasured doubly cabibbo - suppressed ( dcs )",
    "modes , their rates can be determined from the diagrammatic approach .",
    "we obtained @xmath43 and @xmath44 from the @xmath41 and @xmath42 final states which account for nearly half of the hadronic width of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that when all hadronic states are summed over , one could have @xmath45 and @xmath46 . at any rate , indirect violation",
    "is suppressed by the smallness of the mixing parameters @xmath47 and @xmath40 and , moreover , it tends to cancel in the difference between @xmath48 and @xmath49 final states .",
    "there are also a lot of experimental efforts measuring direct asymmetries in @xmath28 decays with 3-body and 4-body final states .",
    "this will involve a more complicated and time - consuming dalitz - plot analysis .",
    "nevertheless , the analysis will be very rewarding as it will provide us with much more information about the underlying mechanism for violation .",
    "we plan to explore this topic elsewhere .",
    "the purpose of this work is to provide a realistic sm estimate of direct violation in two - body hadronic @xmath28 decays based on the topological - diagram approach . in sec .",
