    "aluminum antimonide is receiving much renewed interest for applications ranging from ionizing radiation detection to microelectronics to optoelectronics . for gamma radiation detection",
    ", alsb is particularly promising as a novel material enabling high energy - resolution detection at room temperature due to its indirect band gap of 1.6ev , the high atomic number of sb , and the potentially high electron and hole mobilities of up to several hundred @xmath4v@xmath5s@xmath5 at room temperature.@xcite improved materials for high resolution , room temperature gamma radiation detectors are critically needed for applications in nuclear nonproliferation and monitoring , homeland security , and also medical and space imaging applications .",
    "such detectors operate by counting the number of electron - hole pairs created in the semiconductor upon interaction with a gamma ray . thus",
    ", a small band gap is generally desired to maximize the number of generated carriers , increasing the signal and reducing the shot noise . however , if the band gap is too small , excess thermal noise is generated from carriers thermally excited across the gap .",
    "at room temperature , a gap of @xmath61.6ev is nearly optimal . in a similar vein , low intrinsic carrier concentrations in the material",
    "may be desired to reduce the background signal , another noise source .",
    "furthermore , high energy resolution ( counting statistics ) is achieved by maximizing the efficiency of charge collection , which requires high carrier mobilities and long carrier lifetimes .",
    "an indirect band gap can be advantageous for maximizing carrier lifetimes by quenching radiative recombination .",
    "finally , high atomic number in the material is desired to increase the stopping power for high energy radiation , reducing the required size of the device .",
    "presently , the purity of large single - crystal growths of alsb limits its performance for radiation detection application .    in microelectronics , alsb and related alloys containing in , are finding use in advanced field - effect transistor designs that promise higher switching speeds and lower power consumption compared to silicon devices.@xcite the material has also found use in high current density , high speed resonant tunnel diodes.@xcite in optoelectronics , thin films of alsb are being used in active regions and superlattice structures for claddings in novel type - ii infrared cascade lasers.@xcite such lasers , emitting wavelengths around 34.3@xmath7 m , find application , for example , in remote atmospheric chemical sensing .",
    "aluminum antimonide is particularly interesting in these applications because it has a large 2.1ev conduction band offset with inas , which often comprises the other key component in the active layers of these devices .    in the present work",
    ", we present a careful analysis of the thermodynamic and electronic properties of intrinsic point defects in alsb , since the electronic and transport properties of the material can be degraded by detrimental defects .",
    "the main goals of this study are to identify the most important intrinsic point defects and to establish the concentrations of defects and charge carriers in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this work is part of a larger effort to understand the fundamental microscopic limits of performance of this and other semiconductor materials .",
    "future work will focus on extrinsic impurities in the material , as well as the implications on carrier transport properties .",
    "our major findings in this work are that the dominant native defects in alsb are aluminum interstitials , antimony antisites , and aluminum vacancies , dependent on chemical environment and doping .",
    "the equilibrium concentration of total native defects near the melting temperature is found to be in the @xmath8 to @xmath9@xmath10 range , while at lower temperatures , concentrations down to @xmath11@xmath10 or lower are expected .",
    "the electron chemical potential in pure material is near the middle of the band gap , however the material tends naturally to be slightly _ n_-type doped by charged aluminum interstitials .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sect : method ] we review the thermodynamic formalism we use to derive defect formation energies and concentrations from first principles calculations , and describe the computational details which underlie the present work . in sec .",
    "[ sect : results ] we report the relaxed defect geometries , defect formation energies , and the charge carrier and defect concentrations , which are obtained by self - consistently solving the charge neutrality condition . finally , in sec .  [ sect : discussion ] we discuss the intrinsic limitations of alsb on the basis of our results and the relation to experimental data .",
    "the appendix contains a brief derivation of the band gap correction scheme utilized in the present work .",
    "a material in thermodynamic equilibrium must contain a certain number of point defects at finite temperature , due to entropy .",
    "the temperature dependence of the equilibrium defect concentration can be shown to obey the following relation @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the concentration of possible defect sites , @xmath14 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath15 is absolute temperature .",
    "the gibbs energy of defect formation , @xmath16 , can be split into three distinct terms @xmath17 the formation entropy , @xmath18 , is typically on the order of @xmath19 , so the entropy term hardly exceeds 0.1ev even at elevated temperatures . in some cases , entropic effects could play a role in stabilizing a defect at high temperatures when the enthalpy differences are small .",
    "we do not explicitly treat this effect here , but point out cases in our results where it may be important .",
    "the formation volume , @xmath20 , describes the pressure dependence of the gibbs energy of formation and is typically some small fraction of the atomic volume , so it can be neglected at ordinary pressures .",
    "the most important contribution is the defect formation energy , @xmath21 . in the following , we therefore focus on the formation energy and for simplicity ignore both the entropy and volume terms .    for a binary compound the formation energy for a defect in charge state @xmath22",
    "is given by@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the total energy of the system containing the defect , @xmath25 denotes the number of atoms of type @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the chemical potential of component @xmath26 in its reference state , and we have written the terms using explicit labels for alsb .",
    "neglecting entropic contributions , the chemical potentials of the reference phases can be replaced by their cohesive energies at 0k .",
    "the formation energy depends on the chemical environment via the parameter @xmath28 , which describes the variation of the chemical potentials under different conditions .",
    "the range of @xmath28 is constrained by the formation energy of alsb by @xmath29 , where for the present convention @xmath30 and @xmath31 correspond to al and sb - rich conditions , respectively .",
    "finally , the formation energy also depends on the electron chemical potential , @xmath32 , which is measured with respect to the valence band maximum , @xmath33 .",
    "the energy terms in eq .   were calculated using density functional theory ( dft ) carried out in the local density approximation ( lda ) using the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite and the projector augmented - wave ( paw ) method.@xcite defect formation energies were obtained using supercells of various size containing 32 , 64 , 128 , and 216 atoms .",
    "extrapolation was used to account for finite - size effects as described in detail in sec .",

    "brillouin zone integrations were performed with @xmath34-point grids generated using the monkhorst - pack scheme.@xcite for the 32 and 64-atom cells , a non - shifted @xmath35 mesh was used , while for the 128-atom cell , a shifted @xmath36 grid was used . for the 216-atom cell ,",
    "a non - shifted @xmath37 mesh was constructed .",
    "the plane wave cutoff energy was set to 300ev and gaussian smearing with a width of 0.1ev was used to determine the occupation numbers . for charged defect calculations ,",
    "a homogeneous background charge was employed ( by omitting the @xmath38 term in the potential ) to ensure charge neutrality of the entire cell .",
    "atomic relaxations were performed to determine the equilibrium structures of the defects , with ionic forces converged to 20/  and all calculations performed at the theoretical equilibrium volume .",
    "relaxations from various randomized initial configurations were performed to avoid high - symmetry local energy minima in the structures .",

    "the small filled and large open symbols respectively show the data without and with the monopole - monopole correction term .",
    "note that , particularly for the charged aluminum vacancy , the monopole - monopole correction is the dominant size - dependent term .",
    "the monopole - monopole correction does not apply for neutral defects . ]    in the supercell approximation there are spurious interactions between defects and their periodic images which lead to systematic errors.@xcite for neutral defects the leading error is due to elastic interactions , which cause an overestimation of the formation energy .",
    "the strain energy of a point - like inclusion can be derived from linear elasticity theory and can be shown to fall off roughly with @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the distance between periodic images .",
    "@xcite therefore , the formation energy in the dilute limit ( @xmath42 ) can be obtained by finite - size scaling with @xmath40 , which removes the elastic strain component .",
    "makov and payne considered the convergence of the energy of charged systems in periodic systems and proposed a correction on the basis of a multipole expansion.@xcite the leading term corresponds to the monopole - monopole interaction and scales with @xmath43 .",
    "this term can be analytically determined if the static dielectric constant of the medium , @xmath44 , and the madelung constant of the bravais lattice of the supercell , @xmath45 , are known:@xcite @xmath46 the next higher order term in the expansion is the monopole - quadrupole interaction which scales as @xmath40 .",
    "even higher order terms ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) are usually small and therefore neglected . in the present work ,",
    "we have applied the monopole - monopole correction term using the experimental value for the static dielectric constant ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "then , since both the elastic and the monopole - quadrupole interactions scale with @xmath40 , we employed finite - size scaling with @xmath40 to correct for these terms .",
    "this extrapolation scheme gave very small extrapolation errors as shown in tables  [ tab : eform1 ] and [ tab : eform2 ] .",
    "the results of the finite - size scaling procedure are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : finitesize ] for the most important defects .",
    "figure  [ fig : finitesize ] clearly illustrates the effect of the monopole - monopole correction term which tremendously reduces the variation between the supercells .",
    "the remaining higher - order variations are very well captured by the @xmath40 finite - size scaling .",
    "in addition , the potential alignment correction described in ref .   is implicitly taken into account by our extrapolation scheme.@xcite      the underestimation of the band gap ( by the lda ) affects the formation energies , as discussed in detail in the appendix .",
    "a simple correction scheme based on the band energy has been proposed by persson _",
    "_ @xcite and is further motivated in the appendix .",
    "the correction amounts to the following term which is added to the as - calculated formation energies : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are shifts of the valence and conduction band edges , respectively , to correct the band gap , while @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the number of unoccupied valence and occupied conduction band states , respectively .",

    "considerable differences are observed between the two cases , with the values corrected using the scheme presented here being more consistent . in fact , we observe that , qualitatively , the results obtained by applying no correction at all are more similar to the corrected results than what is obtained by assigning the band gap error fully to the conduction band.@xcite furthermore , a correction procedure often suggested in the literature@xcite to simply shift the ionization energies of donor - like defects to track the conduction band minimum ( implicitly leaving the ionization energies of acceptor - like defects tracking the valence band maximum ) , without accounting for the occupation of states , does not properly correct the errors in the formation energies .",
    "the scheme employed here results in an identical shift of the ionization energies , but also corrects the errors in the formation energies.however , we note that this scheme still neglects both level relaxations and changes in the double counting term .",
    "we believe the method presented here is the most consistent way to address the lda band gap problem , with the use of _ gw _ calculations providing a first principles approach to calculating the correction terms .",

    "[ fig : eform ] ) , the alsb antisite defect can also be important when the material is lightly doped @xmath129-type ( near the crossing with @xmath3 ) , particularly considering the uncertainty in the range of @xmath130 vs @xmath131 and the possible errors in the formation energies of up to about 0.1ev from entropic effects . for sb - rich conditions ( right panel in fig .",

    "[ fig : dconcdmu ] is located on the sb - rich side , corresponding to the crossing of the concentrations of @xmath0 and @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : defectstypes ] .",
    "since the charge neutrality condition [ eq .  ] depends only on the concentrations of charged defects , the neutral @xmath121 antisites do not contribute to charge compensation or net electron concentration .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sect : conc ] , the calculated electron concentration slightly exceeds the hole concentration for pure material , yielding _",
    "n_-type intrinsic material irrespective of the chemical environment characterized by @xmath28 .",
    "this behavior results because the formation energies of acceptor - type defects ( @xmath3 ) always exceed the formation energies of donor - type defects ( @xmath0 , @xmath2 ) when the electron chemical potential is close to the middle of the band gap ( see fig .",

    "it should be noted that this situation is changed if the material is extrinsically doped . for _ p_-doped material ,",
    "the donor - type native defects remain dominant and partially compensate the extrinsic dopant . for _ n_-doped material ,",

    "the temperatures indicated in figs .",
    "[ fig : defectstypes ] and [ fig : dconc_defects_dmu ] refer to thermal equilibrium conditions at those temperatures . in practice",
    ", these temperatures can be interpreted as corresponding to annealing temperatures , with the chemical potential difference referring to the chemical environment of the annealing process ( e.g. , an sb overpressure corresponds to sb - rich conditions ; conversely , growth is often performed under al - rich conditions ) .",
    "the highest temperature considered here , 1300k , is just below the melting point of 1327k and might represent melt growth conditions .",
    "however , growth is typically performed too rapidly to allow equilibrium to be achieved and the non - equilibrium grown - in defect concentrations will be higher than predicted here .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : dconc_defects_dmu ] essentially represent the predicted concentrations for infinitely long anneals at the specified temperatures .    at 1300k ,",
    "the calculated net electron concentration varies roughly between @xmath8 and @xmath133 depending on the chemical potential difference , @xmath28 . if all defects are assumed to be sufficiently mobile down to 700k so that the material can reach thermal equilibrium at that temperature , then the lowermost curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : dconc_defects_dmu ] predict a net electron concentration of @xmath11 to @xmath134 and a total defect concentration between @xmath11 and @xmath135 .",
    "since the diffusivity depends exponentially on the inverse temperature , the defect mobilities decrease sharply with temperature .",
    "therefore , as the temperature is further lowered the system will no longer be able to reach the equilibrium concentration in reasonable time , which requires excess defects either to diffuse to the surface or to anneal by recombination .",
    "in contrast to lattice defects , the intrinsic electron and hole concentrations , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , readily adjust to temperature changes .",
    "the `` freezing in '' of the defect concentrations is therefore expected to crucially affect the charge neutrality condition upon cooling to low ( e.g. , room ) temperatures ( in particular if there are no extrinsic dopants ) . however , since the diffusivities of the individual defects are currently unknown , we can not quantitatively describe this `` freezing in '' of the defect distributions in the present study ; thus , predictions of the charge carrier and defect concentrations near room temperature and below may be unreliable .",
    "the determination of diffusivities for specific defects , to account for the kinetics of defect `` freeze - in , '' will be the subject of future work .    experimentally , alsb crystals grown from the melt have often been found to display _",
    "p_-type conductivity.@xcite the present finding that the pure material behaves intrinsically _ n_-type is , however , not in contradiction with this observation .",
    "a typical experimental setup employs a graphite susceptor , alumina crucible , and quartz tubes for melting sb , which are potential sources of various impurities , most importantly carbon , oxygen , silicon , and aluminum.@xcite in particular , carbon impurities act as acceptors , therefore accidental _",
    "p_-type doping is a very likely scenario which is supported by chemical analysis of grown alsb crystals and measurements on intentionally doped samples.@xcite the measured levels of carbon impurities and the experimental observation that the material becomes intrinsic around 1000k ( ref .  [ ] ) are consistent with our calculated excess native electron concentration at that temperature . a detailed study of the role of extrinsic defects in alsb is beyond the scope of the present work ; however , the results of ongoing work to elucidate the effects of impurities and to investigate ways to optimize the electronic properties of the material by intentional doping are forthcoming .",
    "in summary , we have employed density functional theory calculations to study the properties of intrinsic point defects in aluminum antimonide . an exhaustive set of defect configurations including vacancies , antisites , and interstitials ( tetrahedral , hexagonal , and split ) , with all relevant charge states was considered based on knowledge of other iii - v compounds .",
    "relaxed atomic structures of each defect were carefully determined , and formation energies were calculated to evaluate the equilibrium concentrations of each defect .",
    "strain and electrostatic artifacts related to the use of the supercell approach were carefully removed by employing a finite - size scaling procedure , which involved performing a series of calculations for each defect with supercell sizes ranging from 32 to 216 atoms .",
    "the underestimation of the band gap due to the local density approximation was taken into account by applying an _ a posteriori _ correction scheme that utilized separate _",
    "calculations to obtain valence and conduction band offsets , which enter the correction .",
    "aluminum interstitials ( @xmath0 ) , antimony antisites ( @xmath136 , @xmath2 ) , and aluminum vacancies ( @xmath3 ) were found to be the most dominant defects , depending on the electron chemical potential and the chemical potential difference ( chemical environment ) of the system .",
    "we observe that @xmath0 interstitials and @xmath101 antisites dominate under al - rich and sb - rich conditions , respectively .",

    "n_-type  and predict both the total defect and the net electron concentrations . near the melting point , the equilibrium concentration of native defects is predicted to be in the @xmath8 to @xmath9@xmath10 range , while at lower temperatures , it is expected that concentrations down to the @xmath11@xmath10 range or lower can be achieved . the net excess electron density in bulk grown material might be as high as @xmath137 to @xmath138@xmath10 from `` freeze - in '' of defects from melt solidification .    for extrinsically doped material , which we do not treat explicitly in detail in this work ,",
    "the dominant native defects depend on the nature of the doping . for _ n_-doped material , @xmath3 and @xmath139 tend to be important , while for _ p_-doped material , @xmath0 and @xmath122 are important , depending on chemical environment ( al - rich vs. sb - rich ) .",
    "some amount of self - compensation from the native defects occurs in both cases .",
    "finally , we note that the present work is part of a concerted research effort which ultimately aims to provide a complete and consistent picture of the point defect properties of alsb and the relations to carrier transport properties .",
    "we are engaged in further theoretical and experimental work to explore the role of extrinsic defects , as well as the scattering behavior of defects on carrier transport . in this context , the present study forms the basis for these future studies , which will be the subjects of forthcoming reports .",
