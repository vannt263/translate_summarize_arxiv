    "the rapid evolution of bright x - ray sources makes the knowledge of optical properties of materials increasingly important ( e.g. elinp@xcite , xfel@xcite ) from the point of view of novel techniques and applications . in the few kev regime ,",
    "extremely small foci and polarisers with unprecedented purity are revolutionising measurement techniques . at the same time",
    "optical properties provide a sensitive observable allowing fundamental interaction processes of waves with matter to be probed .",
    "the dispersion and refraction of electro - magnetic waves have been theoretically described by r. kronig and h. a. kramers @xcite .",
    "the wavelength dependent forward atomic scattering amplitude can be written as a complex scattering amplitude @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the frequency independent part , while the complex term describes the frequency dependent part of the scattering amplitude , which is known as the anomalous scattering factor @xcite . via the lorentz relation @xmath3 the scattering properties of an atom are related to the macroscopic description of the index of refraction @xcite , where @xmath4 is the classical electron radius and @xmath5 is the wavelength of the radiation . the sum @xmath6 covers all @xmath7 atoms of the sample with the atomic charge number @xmath8 and the anomalous scattering factor of each @xmath6-th atom . therefore the forward scattering amplitude can be accessed directly by measuring the refractive index and insight can therefore be gained into the frequency dependence of scattering processes of the irradiated material . in the x - ray energy range ,",
    "refractive index measurements were performed with the main motivation to investigate the forward atomic scattering amplitude @xcite . from an application point of view , the knowledge of the x - ray refractive index was important to realise first refractive optics , which are well established in today s x - ray applications in biomedical , physical and material sciences @xcite . to date , the refractive index of some materials has been experimentally determined mainly up to a photon energy of 133 kev @xcite .",
    "materials with a low atomic charge number @xmath8 were primarily investigated , since photo - absorption increases strongly with @xmath8 . as a first approximation for the calculation of the dispersion curve ,",
    "the real part of the complex forward scattering amplitude in a classical non - relativistic approximation can be assumed to be dominated by rayleigh scattering . using the thomas - reiche - kuhn @xcite sum rule @xmath9 , the real part of the index of refraction",
    "can be written as @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the vacuum speed of light , @xmath12 is avogadro s constant , @xmath13 the @xmath0-photon energy and @xmath14 the atomic mass .",
    "this classical approximation for the rayleigh scattering is well established in atomic scattering processes in the low x - ray energy range and in the case of light atoms with low @xmath8 .",
    "information on the refractive index at much higher energies - in the mev @xmath0-energy range - was only accessible via extrapolation of the classical model .",
    "however , since the underlying interactions and scattering physics change in relative importance with increasing photon energies , the question arises up to which energy the extrapolation remains valid .",
    "the development of highly brilliant tuneable @xmath0-ray sources further motivates this research @xcite .",
    "certain applications envisaged on these facilities , such as nuclear resonance fluorescence ( nrf ) based detection , radiography and transmutation experiments , would benefit significantly from focusing optics in the mev regime .",
    "therefore , from a fundamental , but also applied physics point of view , it is important to establish a reliable experimental knowledge of the refractive behaviour of electromagnetic radiation at @xmath0-ray energies .    a first experiment to measure the index of refraction of silicon in the @xmath0-energy range from 181 kev to 2000 kev was performed in 2011 , using the high resolution double flat crystal spectrometer gams5 at the ill in grenoble @xcite .",
    "the index of refraction is typically denoted as a complex number @xmath15 , where the real part @xmath16 describes the phase shift of the electro - magnetic wave after propagation through matter , while the imaginary part describes the absorption . in the x - ray energy range ,",
    "the decrement @xmath16 from @xmath17 is tiny ( @xmath18 to @xmath19 ) and has a negative sign @xcite .",
    "however , in the 2011 experiment , an unexpected change in the sign of @xmath16 from negative to positive was observed above 500 kev and efforts at interpreting the underlying physics were made .",
    "a first attempt in reference @xcite to attribute the sign - change to virtual pair creation , like delbrck scattering , turned out to be inadequate to explain the experimental findings , as detailed theoretical work indicates that the contribution from delbrck scattering to the real part of the refraction index is many orders of magnitude too low to account for the observed effect @xcite .",
    "to further intensify the search for the underlying physics , a campaign was launched to look into the scaling of the refractive index with atomic number ( ge ) in 2013 . the possibility that systematic errors may have affected the result",
    "was also pursued , with a focus on temporal drifts in the spectrometer and re - measuring the identical silicon prisms from 2011 .",
    "the 2013 experiment also employed with a slightly different measurement sequence ( allowing better drift correction ) and also better statistics .",
    "the 2013 campaign showed the same sign - change effect again for silicon , but it was not observed in a germanium prism , motivating further detailed studies .",
    "however , a direct continuation of this activity was not possible , since the gams5 was decommissioned at the end of 2013 and until 2015 no further experiments were possible .",
    "interest renewed in the second half of 2015 , when two new instruments , gams6 and digra , were again put into operation , allowing for a continuation of the research activity .",
    "the research was taken up by a new cooperation between the helmholtz institut jena ( jena , germany ) , the ill ( grenoble , france ) and the lmu ( munich , germany ) , with the aim of measuring a wider range of elements to elucidate the underlying physics and with a view to developing gamma ray optics .",
    "the campaign also had the expressed aim of eliminating the possibility of any diffractive effects affecting the measurement by including materials in the liquid phase ( these results will be discussed in a forthcoming publication ) .",
    "the current publication focuses on a re - evaluation of the 2011 data together with the 2013 experiment on gams5 in the light of the recent results on gams6 . in this publication",
    "we focus on the silicon data .",
    "new data from a second set of silicon prisms is presented as well as a dedicated investigation of the refractive prism used during 2011 and 2013 experiments .",
    "diffraction in the 2011/13 prism set is identified as the systematic error that affected the earlier measurements and gave rise to an ( erroneous ) interpretation of a positive refractive index decrement @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , we report on a new measurement of the refractive index on gams6 , using an improved setup and a new silicon prism set , which eliminates many potential systematic errors identified in the first generation experiments on gams5 .",
    "the new findings show that the dispersive behaviour of silicon at @xmath0-ray energies is in agreement with existing theory .",
    "the general concept of our refraction index measurements is well known and based on prism optics @xcite . in the visible range of the electro - magnetic spectrum this method has been established for more than a century @xcite and later applied in the soft x - ray regime @xcite .",
    "the principle consists in i ) defining a low - divergence monochromatic photon beam , ii ) deflecting it via refraction at the interfaces of a prism and iii ) measuring the deviation angle with respect to the incident beam .",
    "the experimental setup has to fulfill several requirements : collimating the incident beam , monochromatizing it and analyzing the direction at the output .",
    "according to the classical model , the refractive effect decreases strongly with photon energy ( @xmath20 ) within the x - ray or @xmath0-energy regime .",
    "therefore the experiment should increase its sensitivity with increasing energy . in our experiment ,",
    "the function of primary beam monochromator and collimator is fulfilled by the first single crystal .",
    "photons coming from the source are diffracted within a particular energy band width @xmath21 and within a certain angular range @xmath22 .",
    "the angular width @xmath23 is the so - called darwin width @xcite and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the bragg diffraction angle .",
    "after the first crystal the propagation angle of the monochromatic beam is analysed via a second single crystal . inserting the refracting prism between two single crystals allows the deflection to be measured by rocking the second crystal , while keeping the first crystal fixed to diffract the same photon energy .",
    "the refractive index for this particular energy can be derived from the angular deflection due to the prism .",
    "this process can then be repeated for different energies to obtain the energy dependence of the refractive index .",
    "this general concept of the measurement was the same in all experiments , although the particular realisation was slightly different ( see details in the according sections ) .",
    "both crystals prepare and analyse the beam via diffraction and the sensitivity of the experiment is directly related to this process . via dynamical diffraction theory @xcite it can be shown that @xmath26 .",
    "this relation refers to the angular width @xmath23 of the diffracted beams .",
    "the sensitivity with respect to angular shifts @xmath27 is typically two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the width and therefore we expect it to be in the order of @xmath28 of the bragg angle . from bragg s law",
    "it can be easily shown that @xmath29 , while the refractive effect of the prisms scales with @xmath20 .",
    "therefore it is already evident , that such a measurement will be sensitive only up to some maximum energy .",
    "the sensitivity is further affected by additional errors in the angle measurement ( vibrations , goniometer drift error etc . ) .      for our experiments",
    "the @xmath0-beam was provided from an in - pile target inserted in an irradiation position in the high - flux neutron research reactor at the institut laue langevin ( grenoble , france ) .",
    "we used powder samples consisting of 10 grams of gd@xmath30o@xmath31 or 6 grams of bacl@xmath30 , respectively , held in graphite containers @xcite .",
    "these containers were placed in a beam tube close to the reactor core and irradiated by thermal neutrons with a flux of around @xmath32 s@xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 beam is produced by neutron capture nuclear reactions on the @xmath35gd or @xmath36cl isotopes of the samples with subsequent prompt @xmath0 emission .",
    "the @xmath0-photon emission rate was up to 10@xmath37 s@xmath33 .",
    "the produced @xmath0-rays are pre - collimated by a collimator system over a distance of 15 m for digra , 17 m ( for gams5 ) or 20 m for gams6 from the @xmath0 source ( the source size across the beam is @xmath38 mm@xmath39 ) to the spectrometer .",
    "the divergence of the beam is in the order of @xmath40 rad in the horizontal plane ( diffraction plane of the crystals ) and @xmath41 rad in the vertical plane . behind the spectrometers and their diffracting crystal ,",

    "the goniometers are additionally mounted on xyz translation tables , allowing crystals to be scanned in position .",
    "the angular resolution of the instrument is limited ( when compared to the gams instruments ) and was used for diffraction measurements in the si prism , where a combination of translation and rotation features was important . for the actual index of refraction measurement ,",

    "two mach - zehnder type interferometers , but based on common optical components , allow each axis to be measured individually as well as their relative position .",
    "the layout of the interferometer is made such that any drift of optical components and glass refractive index would introduce the same measurement error on both crystal axes . as a consequence ,",

    "this measurement scheme results in so called `` 2-pack '' data - pairs of two scans . during the analysis it turned out that the angular measurements were not completely free of temporal drifts ( see discussion below ) . therefore the 2013 experiment was made using an improved measurement sequence consisting of four scans : i ) a positive scan of the reference beam ii , iii ) a negative and a positive scan of the refracted beam and iv ) a negative scan of the reference beam .",
    "the refraction angle was determined from a linear combination of this so called `` 4-pack '' with the goal of reducing the impact of the linear temporal drift .          the data analysis consisted of two steps : a ) the fit of a theoretical lineshape to each scan to determine the peak position and b ) the extraction of a difference of peak positions due to refraction .",

    "a range of materials ( particularly liquids ) of differing atomic number z as well as a new set of silicon prisms were investigated .",
    "a particular focus was put on the question , whether the silicon prisms showed diffraction effects at angles close to those used in the experimental arrangement and affect the refractive index measurement by adding a diffractive component to the angular deviation of the beam .",
    "the silicon prisms were investigated separately , using the double axis diffractometer digra , as it allowed both linear translation and rotation of the prism through a monochromatic , microradian divergence beam .",
    "the general setup is shown in fig [ radiography1 ] . in a first measurement ,",
    "the prism was rocked at several energies of the beam , while the detector measured the intensity of the transmitted beam .",
    "assuming the prism material to be non - diffracting and a rather narrow rocking angle range ( less than 2 degrees ) , no variation of intensity was expected . however",
    ", strong effects were detected and associated with diffraction of the @xmath61 planes of the silicon material parallel to the base side of the prism .",
    "the effect was studied for energies from 181 kev up to 1 mev and it could be shown that up to 50@xmath62 of the intensity could be diffracted .",
    "the angular acceptance of the diffraction ( fwhm of the rocking curve ) was measured to be in the order of 500 @xmath63rad .",
    "this is much larger than the angular acceptance of a perfect crystal and can be possibly explained due to strain from the surface polishing process .",
    "based on this measurement , it was possible to reconstruct a scenario explaining the angular deviation measured in the 2011 and 2013 experiments as a superposition of both refraction and diffraction , rather than an anomalous refraction effect with positive decrement @xmath16 .",
    "we constructed a simple model , based on the refractive deviation of the beam scaling as @xmath64 , while the diffractive part scales as @xmath65 with photon energy .",
    "further it was assumed that the diffractive part only starts to superpose the refracted beam above a certain energy . to understand this assumption , it is important to notice that we assume the diffraction to be caused by a fraction of the primary beam , which has not been diffracted by the first crystal of gams5 .",
    "this beam has also a divergence of the order of 500 @xmath63rad , which is matched by the acceptance of the prism . in order to enable diffraction from the prism , the primary",
    "beam has to be within the acceptance range for diffraction .",
    "since the angle of the incidence of the primary beam onto the prism changed with increasing energy , there will be a critical energy from which on diffraction takes place . in order to fit the experimental data of the 2011 gams5 experiment",
    ", we defined therefore the following model :    @xmath66    as the exact orientation of the prism in the 2011 and 2013 runs is not known , the combination of diffraction and refraction effects is described by scaling constants @xmath67 , which correspond to the refraction and diffraction angles , while the parameters @xmath68 describe the onset of diffraction .",
    "all parameters were fitted , yielding an almost perfect agreement of the model with the experimental data .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ refraction_diffraction ] , which shows that the measured sign - change can be completely explained by the crystalline properties of the prism material .",
    "the combination of diffraction and refraction is therefore the underlying systematic error affecting the 2011 and 2013 gams5 measurements in silicon . in combination with our most recent results , which show agreement with existing theory using a different set of silicon prisms , it is evident that the report of anomalous refractive behaviour in silicon described in @xcite has been superseded by our current results .",

    "these factors have clearly been improved in the gams6 setup , resulting in substantially smaller error bars in figure [ fig3 ] . from the experimental data obtained gams6 , we conclude that the extrapolation of equation ( [ e1 ] ) holds up to energies of about 2 mev in silicon .",
    "the experimental technique developed and applied with the gams6 setup has shown to be capable of delivering high quality data , allowing the refractive index of materials with mev photon energies to be measured .",
