    "the study of structure formation of electrorheological ( er ) fluids has attracted increasing interest in recent years for its fundamental and technological values . upon the application of an external electric field , the suspended particles in an er fluid aggregate into chains and then columns parallel to the field , and drastically change the rheology of the suspension @xcite .",
    "tao and his coworker first suggested the existence of microcrystalline structures inside the columns and identified its ground state to be a body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) lattice @xcite .",
    "these authors developed an analytic method based on a point - dipole ( pd ) approximation , i.e. , treating the dielectric spheres as point dipoles interacting with one another .",
    "the possible ground state is the configuration that minimizes the dipole interaction energy and consequently the total coulomb energy . the idea was soon confirmed by computer simulations and experiments @xcite .",
    "the discovery of this property is not only helpful to understand further the er response to the external field , but also offers a new technique to form mesocrystals with unique photonic properties @xcite .",
    "after many efforts to reveal the details of structure formation in an er fluid , it has been known that what structure will be formed in such a system actually depends on many factors , such as volume fractions @xcite , the size distribution of particles @xcite , the field frequency @xcite , etc . combining the electrorheological and magnetorheological effects @xcite or applying a rotating electric field @xcite",
    "was also found to cause a structure transition from the bct to face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattices @xcite .",
    "the influence of the dielectric constant is another interesting topic since dielectric mismatch between the particles and the fluid is widely accepted as the main reason for the er phenomenon .",
    "davis found that the bct , fcc and hexagonal closed packed ( hcp ) lattices degenerate when the particle permittivity ( @xmath0 ) is much larger than that of the base fluid ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "clercx and bossis @xcite developed a fully multipolar treatment and compared the bct and fcc lattices for some values of @xmath2 .",
    "their results are in agreement with davis .",
    "lukkarinen and kaski studied both the free energies of many types of lattices and dynamical effects in an er fluid containing particles with the dielectric constant being greater and/or smaller than that of the fluid @xcite .",
    "however , all of the previous work has either limited to the extreme case ( @xmath3 ) or been too complicated to be adopted in further studies . and the understanding of the way dielectric constant affects structure formation is far from being sufficient .",
    "apart from theoretical work , computer simulation is another effective method to gain insight into er effects .",
    "the point - dipole approximation is routinely adopted in simulation @xcite because of its simplicity . since",
    "many - body and multipolar interactions are neglected in this approximation , the predicted strength of er effects is of an order lower than the experimental results . on the other hand ,",
    "the accurate theoretical models are usually too complex to use in dynamic simulation of er fluids .",
    "hence , a model which is easy to use but beyond the point - dipole results is needed in computer simulations .    in this paper",
    ", we use a dipole - induced - dipole ( did ) model @xcite proposed by one of the authors to study the ground state of er fluids in a wide range of the permittivity ratios : @xmath4 .",
    "this model accounts for the multipolar interaction but is significantly simpler compared with existing multipolar theories @xcite , therefore it can serve as a candidate for computer simulation instead of the traditional point - dipole approximation . some computation has been carried out such as the calculation of the interacting force between particles of different sizes and various dielectric constants and the simulation of the athermal aggregation of particles in er fluids , both in uniaxial and rotating fields @xcite . the purpose of this paper is to use this model to deal with structure formation in er fluids and to offer some theoretical prediction as instructions to further dynamic simulations of er fluids .",
    "it is found the ground state of er fluids may vary with the dielectric constant , and the critical dielectric contrast is estimated .",
    "furthermore , we obtain the interaction between two chains containing particles of various dielectric constants and apply it to polydisperse er fluids where the particles have the same size but different permittivities .",
    "the effects of polydispersity on structure formation are investigated .",
    "we start with briefly reviewing the did model and then applying it to deal with the interaction energy between two particles .",
    "the did model is defined from a multiple image method @xcite which is based on a generalization of the image method to dielectric spheres .",
    "first consider a simple situation in which a point dipole @xmath5 is placed at a distance @xmath6 from the center of a sphere .",
    "the orientation of the dipole is perpendicular to the line joining the dipole and the center of the sphere .",
    "if the sphere is conducting , the induced image dipole is exactly given by @xmath7 and at a distance @xmath8 from the center .",
    "generalizing this result to a sphere of dielectric constant @xmath9 placed in a host medium @xmath1 reads @xmath10 with @xmath11 as the dipolar factor @xmath12 . if the orientation of the point dipole is parallel to the axis , then @xmath13 . in the limit @xmath14 , the above results reduce to the conducting sphere case .    then consider a pair of dielectric spheres a and b , of the same radius @xmath15 but different dielectric constants @xmath16 and @xmath17 , separated by a distance @xmath6 , in a base fluid of a dielectric constant @xmath1 . upon the application of an electric field @xmath18",
    ", the induced dipole moments in the individual spheres are respectively given by p_a0=_f e_0 a^3 , p_b0=_f ",
    "e_0 a^3 with the dipole factors @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the initial dipole moment @xmath21 induces an image dipole @xmath22 in sphere b , while @xmath22 induces another image dipole @xmath23 in sphere a. as a result an infinite series of dipoles @xmath24 are formed inside sphere a and the total dipole moments for transverse and longitudinal fields are respectively given by p_al & = & ^3 _ n=1^[+ ] , + p_at & = & ^3 _ n=1^[+ ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) satisfies = .",
    "similar expressions for the total dipole moments inside sphere b , namely @xmath26 and @xmath27 , can be obtained by interchanging @xmath11 and @xmath28 .",
    "we should remark that the present generalization is only approximate because there is no image method for a dielectric sphere .",
    "an integral equation approach was proposed to examine the validity of the multiple image method in ref .",
    "it was shown that eq .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) can produce good results at high dielectric contrast @xmath29 as expected , and the model keeps reasonable even in the low contrast case @xcite .",
    "how many terms are retained in the analytic multiple image result determines different models . with only the @xmath30 term in the series of eq .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , it reduces to the traditional point - dipole approximation , while the did model is defined by retaining the first two terms ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) . taking part of the multipole effects into account ,",
    "the did model is generally better than the pd results , especially in polydisperse systems , and can be chosen as an effective approximation to calculate multipolar interaction @xcite .",
    "the incorporation of multipole effects leads to one of the obvious differences between the pd and did model : the symmetry of negative and positive @xmath11s will be broken in the latter , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "this asymmetry of the dipolar factor will also be exhibited in the interaction energy between particles , as shown below , and finally affect the structure formation in er fluids .",
    "it implies that different structures may form when the dielectric constant of particles is smaller than that of the host fluid .",
    "now we begin to apply the did model to deal with the interaction energy between two particles .",
    "the electrostatic energy of the two particles upon the application of an electric field @xmath18 at an arbitrary angle @xmath32 ( fig .",
    "2a ) is given by @xcite w=-[(p_al+p_bl)^2+(p_at+p_bt)^2 ] .",
    "substituting the dipole moment expressions into eq .",
    "( 5 ) and letting @xmath33 , @xmath34 , we can get the energy using the did approximation as w&=&-e_0p_0+(- ) + [ -(3 ^ 2 + 1 ) ] + & + & ^2[-^2(9 ^ 2 - 1 ) ] + & & w_f+w_0+w_1+w_2 , where the dimensionless parameters have been defined : = ( ) ^3 ,  = ( ) ^3 ,  r.the first term @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) is the energy of the individual particles by the applied field , which is independent of the relative position of the particles , while the remaining terms correspond to the interaction energy which determines the formation of ground states @xcite .",
    "note that the term @xmath36 is , if @xmath37 , exactly the result of tao _ et al .",
    "_ s work @xcite , in which they dealt with the monodisperse case in the use of a pd approximation and concluded that a bct lattice will form as the ground state .",
    "so what we are interested in is the last two terms which describe the did correction to the total interparticle energy .",
    "adding the hard - core repulsion which keeps the particles from coalescing ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be rewritten as w_1 & = & - _ n=6 a _ = - _",
    "n=6 a_[4 + ] + w_2&=&-^2 ^2 _ n=9a _",

    "obviously , the did correction can not be ignored when @xmath11 is large , while the term @xmath39 being proportional to @xmath11 instead of @xmath49 shows the asymmetry of @xmath11 in the did model .",
    "now we study a monodisperse er fluid composed of particles with a dielectric constant @xmath50 , which can be larger ( @xmath51 ) or smaller ( @xmath52 ) than that of the fluid @xmath53 .",
    "it has been mentioned that the interacting particles in a er fluid will first form chains between electrode plates , then the chains aggregate into columns containing microstructures .",
    "combined with the images , the chains can be treated as infinite if the distance between two plates is large enough @xcite . the interaction energy per particle",
    "is divided into two parts : one is from the self - energy of an infinite chain , i.e. , the interaction energy between the particles belonging to the same chain ; the other from interaction between different chains @xcite .",
    "consider an infinite chain containing particles of radius @xmath15 and dielectric constant @xmath9 at @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) ( fig .",

    "@xmath57 refers to the interaction energy between two particles .",

    "the total interaction energy per particle in a certain configuration is @xcite u = u^s+_ku^i(_k , z_k ) , where @xmath76 denotes the summation over all chains labeled @xmath77 except the one containing the considered particle .",
    "since the self - energy of a chain is independent of the structure , what really affects the energy difference between various lattices is @xmath66 .",
    "3 shows the dependence of @xmath63 on the shift @xmath48 for different values of @xmath64 when @xmath51 .",
    "the results from the pd approximation are also plotted for comparison .",
    "the interaction may be either attractive or repulsive depending on the shift @xmath48 , and the range of @xmath48 in which two chains attract each other enlarges quickly when @xmath11 increases .",
    "this implies a tendency to form a more close packed structure than the bct lattice with increasing dielectric contract .",
    "the most possible candidate is the fcc lattice , which is nearest to the bct one in energy @xcite .",

    "finally we want to make a comparison with clercx _",
    "s elegant work based on a multipole - expansion theory @xcite .",
    "they expanded the potentials inside and outside the spheres in terms of solid spherical harmonics and gained the values of multipole moments @xmath84 by solving a set of linear equations determined by the boundary conditions at the grain surfaces .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath85 , denoted by @xmath86 , determines how many multipole effects are considered : @xmath87 refers to the simple dipole approximation and @xmath88 to the exact calculation where all multipole effects are included .",

    "_ s model shows that the did results reflects , although not exactly , some characteristics of the third order(@xmath89 ) multipole - expansion theory , i.e. , an octupole effect .",
    "this is particularly obvious when @xmath90 even in the touching - particle case ( see fig .",
    "5 ) , where the point - dipole approximation is known to err considerably .",
    "we expect that the did results may be better than the first approximation of clercx _ et al .",
    "_ s model since the former takes higher multipole effects into consideration .",
    "unfortunately the available data related with the energy ground state are limited in ref .",
    "@xcite and we can not give a thorough comparison .",
    "however , from table 1 in which the ratios of the total induced dipole per particle between the bcc and the fcc lattice calculated with our model are compared with the available results of clercx _ et al .",

    "the bct lattice has been proved to be the stable ground state in a monodisperse system , and the existence of polydispersity tends to destroy its stableness .",
    "however , the magnitude of the ratio @xmath119 is only of the order @xmath120 , so we can conclude that , in a polydisperse system where the dielectric mismatch between particles and the fluid is not very large , similar structures will form but the ground state is not so stable as that in a monodisperse system .",
    "all the results discussed above are based on the assumption that the dielectric constants of particles are distributed at random in the configuration .",
    "but the question is : is the distribution really random , especially when the dielectric constants of particles differ greatly from each other ? in the extreme case , will the phenomenon `` phase separation '' happen , i.e. , identical particles gather together upon the application of the electric field ? in order to investigate this problem , we consider a two - component fluid containing particles with @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",

    "the interaction form in polydisperse fluids is more complex than what we have considered because it is sensitive to the micro structure formed in the er solid and the number of possible configurations in a polydisperse system is much larger than that in a monodisperse one .",
    "the energy gap between the random and phase separation configurations may be narrowed because of the contribution of interaction between chains .",

    "based on the did expression of the interacting energy of two particles , we have corrected the pd results of the self - energy and the interaction energy of chains , including multipole effects partially .",

    "<S> the ground state of an electrorheological ( er ) fluid has been studied based on our recently proposed dipole - induced dipole ( did ) model . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained an analytic expression of the interaction between chains of particles which are of the same or different dielectric constants . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of dielectric constants on the structure formation in monodisperse and polydisperse electrorheological fluids are studied in a wide range of dielectric contrasts between the particles and the base fluid . </S>",
    "<S> our results showed that the established body - centered tetragonal ground state in monodisperse er fluids may become unstable due to a polydispersity in the particle dielectric constants . </S>",
    "<S> while our results agree with that of the fully multipole theory , the did model is much simpler , which offers a basis for computer simulations in polydisperse er fluids . </S>"
