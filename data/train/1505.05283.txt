    "precision spectroscopy of molecules and molecular ions can yield insight into the fundamental physical constants and astrochemical processes @xcite .",
    "coulomb crystals composed of laser - cooled atomic ions and molecular ions provide a pristine environment for studying the properties of molecules @xcite .",
    "the laser - cooled atomic ions serve as both a coolant that reduces the temperature and a sensitive detector that allows for single molecule measurements .",
    "the system has been used to study fundamental reaction dynamics ranging from kinetic isotope effects @xcite to observing the relative reaction rates of molecules whose shape differs by the orientation of a single bond @xcite .",
    "it is also a natural system for precision measurements of molecular ion transitions .",
    "molecular transitions allow for the precise study of fundamental constants using physics that is inaccessible in atomic systems @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy with coulomb crystals has been used to directly measure dipole - forbidden transitions in n@xmath4 @xcite and accurately determine the rovibrational spectrum of hd@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "future experiments to test the stability of fundamental constants in time have been proposed @xcite using the two - ion - species techniques already exploited in the most precise atomic ion clocks @xcite .",
    "expanding these techniques to a wider array of molecular ion species remains a challenge due to the lack of experimental data on molecular ions transitions .",
    "this requires new methods for obtaining spectral information .",
    "the spatial localization of molecular ions in a coulomb crystal results in the required ion density for spectroscopy with low ion numbers relative to traditional techniques .",
    "systems built for high - precision measurement are often incompatible with the survey spectroscopy required to find unknown transitions .",
    "however , this is not the case for coulomb crystals , where the long ion storage time provides multiple opportunities to probe the molecule and the fluorescence of the laser - cooled atomic ion serves as a fast , low - noise detector .",
    "cah@xmath5 is a candidate molecule for testing the possible variation in the proton - to - electron mass ratio @xcite .",
    "it is also expected to be relatively abundant in space due to observation of cah , but has not yet been directly observed @xcite . in both cases , laboratory measurements of rovibrational transitions in cah@xmath5 are required for scientific progress .",
    "resonance enhanced multi - photon dissociation  ( rempd ) is a common tool in physical chemistry where conditional on a resonant transition a final photon dissociates the molecule .",
    "it can be applied to study the vibrations of molecules from diatomics with a single electron @xcite to peptides @xcite .",
    "ion fragments are typically detected by an electron multiplier after mass selection @xcite .",
    "embedding the molecular ions in laser - cooled atomic ions opens up other approaches of detection based on changes in the coulomb crystal shape @xcite and modulation of the atomic ion fluorescence by driving the resonant motion of the molecular ions @xcite .",
    "resolved sideband spectroscopy on a narrow transition of the atomic ions can also be used to identify the fragments @xcite . for the case of cah@xmath0 ,",
    "the measurement is simplified by the trapped fragment ca@xmath0 fluorescing brightly .",
    "this property was used in an ion recycling approach to measure the reaction kinetics of ca@xmath0 + hd by direct dissociation @xcite .",
    "we present the observation of two vibrational overtones of cah@xmath5 by two photon resonant photodissociation of single molecular ions sympathetically cooled by two ca+ ions .",
    "the overtone is excited by a mode - locked laser in order to span the thermally occupied rotational states .",
    "a second photon dissociates the molecule and the resulting ca@xmath5 is detected by a change in fluorescence .",
    "the change in the rate of dissociation as a function of the mode - locked laser wavelength reveals two peaks .",
    "we assign these peaks to the overtone transtions from the ground vibrational state @xmath1 to @xmath2 and @xmath3 based on theoretical predictions .",
    "our observation is the first measurement of a rovibrational transition in cah@xmath5 and shows that single molecular ion experiments can be used to discover new transitions .",
    "we start with loading three @xmath6ca@xmath0 ions by isotope selective photoionization and then laser cooling the ions to form a three ion chain .",
    "the @xmath6ca@xmath0 ions are trapped in a rf paul trap ( r@xmath7  mm ) driven at @xmath8  mhz to confine the ions radially , while static dc voltage applied at the endcaps confines the ions axially .",
    "the trap is kept at a base pressure of about @xmath9  pa . the ions are detected by laser induced fluorescence at 397  nm onto a photon multiplier tube ( pmt ) and electron multiplying charge coupled device ( emccd ) camera .",
    "a narrow bandpass filter is used to ensure that only 397 nm light is detected .",
    "the experimental apparatus has previously been employed for sympathetic heating spectroscopy @xcite and the sideband cooling of molecular ions @xcite    a @xmath6cah@xmath0 molecule is produced by leaking about @xmath10 pa of molecular h@xmath11 into the chamber via a leak valve .",
    "the @xmath6cah@xmath0 is produced via reactive collisions in the gas phase between @xmath6ca@xmath0(4_p_@xmath12 ) and the h@xmath11 as @xmath6ca@xmath0 + h@xmath11 @xmath13 @xmath6cah@xmath0 + h. the product molecule quickly relaxes to its electronic ground state x@xmath14 ( fig .",
    "1 ) and the motion of the molecule is sympathetically cooled by the two ca@xmath5 ions .",
    "the occurrence of a reaction is determined when one of the ions goes dark and there is a drop in fluorescence counts .",
    "once a reaction occurs , the leak valve is closed and the experiment is delayed until the base pressure is reached .",
    "the identity of the molecule can be determined by resolved sideband spectroscopy @xcite and under these experimental conditions we have only observed the formation of cah@xmath5 .",
    "a pinhole before the pmt allows partial light collection from all three ions and reduces background due to scattered light .",
    "misalignment from the crystal center results in three distinct collection efficiencies for each ion position .",
    "this allows us to detect the position of the dark ion from the fluorescence as shown in fig .",
    "the ion position shifts are due to collision with background gas .",
    "small ion chains of any length could be used to collect the data and test experiments were performed loading two to four ca@xmath5 ions .",
    "three ion chains were preferred due to faster molecule formation time relative to two ion chains and improved stability relative to four ion chains .",
    "although the molecular ion is at a translational temperature of a few millikelvin , the internal degrees of freedom are in equilibrium with the room temperature vacuum chamber via black body radiation . a simplified energy level diagram of cah@xmath5 is shown in fig .",
    "1 . the calculated vibrational frequency of the molecule is @xmath15  @xmath16 and we expect that the molecule will be in the ground vibrational state x@xmath14 greater than @xmath17 of the time @xcite . on the other hand , the calculated ground state rotational constant , @xmath18  @xmath16 , is small relative to room temperature .",
    "the rotational states will be populated with an expected value of _ j _ = @xmath19 and the lowest ten _ j _ states are expected to have more than @xmath20 of the population .",
    "our experiment uses a single molecule at a time , but the blackbody radiation will randomize the _ j _ state on the order of minutes . to cover this rotational broadening we use a @xmath21  fs mode - locked laser to drive the overtones .",
    "alternative approaches include reducing the rotational state space by sympathetic cooling with a buffer gas @xcite or a cloud of laser - cooled neutral atoms @xcite or prepare the molecular ions at a specific state by threshold ionization @xcite .",
    "rotational cooling by optical pumping @xcite is currently impossible for cah@xmath0 due to the lack of data on bound transitions .",
    "the two photon photodissociation occurs by first exciting a vibrational overtone of x@xmath14 and then photodissociating to the state c@xmath22 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energylevels ] ) .",
    "we drive the overtone using of a femtosecond mode - locked spectroscopy laser with @xmath23  nm bandwidth allowing us to ignore the line broadening due to rotational transitions .",
    "the second photon comes from a continuous - wave laser at @xmath24  nm .",
    "the powers of the two lasers are 800 mw and 200 @xmath25w respectively .",
    "upon dissociation , the previously dark @xmath6cah@xmath0 ion , will be broken into ca@xmath0 + h , the ca@xmath0 will fluoresce again and there will be an increase in fluorescence counts as shown in fig .",
    "2 . for each central wavelength of the spectroscopy laser ,",
    "we expose the molecular ion to the dissociation lasers and record the time for the molecule to dissociate , @xmath26 .",
    "the transition strength is proportional to the rate @xmath27 .",
    "we repeat the experiment eight times for each wavelength , which resulted in sufficient signal to noise for this survey spectroscopy .",
    "control experiments with the mode - locked laser blocked were used to rule out other processes , including two uv photon absorption and uv induced electron bombardment .",
    "the spectrum clearly shows two peaks which we identify as the @xmath28 and @xmath29 overtones of cah@xmath0 based on theoretical calculations using nrel / cc - pcv5z / caspt2 @xcite  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "we measure the @xmath28 transition to be at 812(3 ) nm compared to the theoretical value of 813.3 nm and @xmath29 transition to be at 890(3 ) nm compared to the theoretical value of 883.3 nm .",
    "this disagreement is in line with observed differences between calculated and measured vibrational transition frequencies in other metal hydrides @xcite .",
    "our experimental setup was intended for high - precision quantum logic spectroscopy @xcite experiments on molecular ions .",
    "we have shown that the same setup can be used for the preliminary large range spectroscopy necessary to observe even weak lines despite trapping only a few ions at a time .",
    "the next step for precision spectroscopy of cah@xmath5 is to reduce the rotational temperature by sympathetic cooling with neutral atoms and then rotationally resolve these transitions and the fundamental transition @xcite .",
    "then quantum logic spectroscopy can be performed on ground state cooled ca@xmath5-cah@xmath5 crystals @xcite in order to reach the precision necessary for observing relative changes in fundamental constants @xcite .",
    "our current experiment takes advantage of the fluorescence of the dissociated product and can be easily applied to other fluorescent product ions .",
    "the method can be modified for dark product ions by periodically blocking the dissociation laser and measuring the mass of the product ion .",
    "this can be achieved by monitoring the sidebands of the atomic ions and calculating the mass of the unknown ion from the observed normal modes @xcite .",
    "the sideband monitoring can be used to extend few ion crystal spectroscopy beyond rempd to any action spectroscopy where the laser - cooled atomic ion is inert .",
    "we expect that few ion coulomb crystals will provide a method for discovering the spectra of ions that are difficult to make in the high numbers required for other spectroscopic methods . as a point of comparison consider the recently reported results on the spectroscopy of ch@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the spectra requires trapping a few thousand molecular ions per frequency . at equilibrium ,",
    "approximately ten percent of those ions form complexes with the he buffer gas , as detected by mass - spectrometry .",
    "the number of complexes is partially depleted when an internal transition is excited through laser induced inhibition of complex growth ( liicg ) @xcite . in the few ion crystal experiment ,",
    "a single ch@xmath30 would be trapped and the normal modes of the crystal monitored .",
    "the formation of the ch@xmath31he would result in a change in the normal mode frequencies .",
    "the system is in dynamic equilibrium and for every applied laser frequency the normal modes are measured multiple times .",
    "the spectral signal is the fraction of measurements where ch@xmath31he is observed .",
    "when the excitation laser is on resonance , the signal is suppressed . in principle",
    ", one could obtain the entire liicg spectra of ch@xmath30 using only a single molecular ion . in practice",
    ", the rates of trapping molecules , forming complexes , and detecting normal modes will determine when the single molecule approach is preferable to other methods .",
