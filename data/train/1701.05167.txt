    "measuring the state will give the solution of the original problem with high probability .",
    "however , the presence of a quantum phase transition ( qpt )  @xcite will imply in the slowdown of the adiabatic evolution , leading to the appearance of excitations during the quantum dynamics .",

    "in such a case , the ramping from the paramagnetic regime to the ferromagnetic ordering does not asymptotically end up in a fully ferromagnetic state .",
    "instead , the system will be described by a mosaic of ordered domains whose finite size depends on the rate of the transition . in particular , in the case of second - order qpts , kzm predicts that the size of the ordered domains scales with the transition time as a universal power law , which is provided in terms of a combination of critical exponents .",
