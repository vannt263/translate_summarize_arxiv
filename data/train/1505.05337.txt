    "in polycrystalline bulk ferromagnets , @xcite the sources of spin disorder are related to lattice imperfections , _",
    "e.g. _ , point defects , dislocations , grain- and phase boundaries , or pores .",
    "these microstructural defects are accompanied by spatial variations of the materials parameters , for instance , the magnitude of the local saturation magnetization , exchange constant , or variations in the magnitude and/or direction of the magnetic anisotropy field . as a result , at a given value of the applied magnetic field ,",
    "these features give rise to a deviation of the magnetization from the perfectly aligned state , in other words , they result in spin misalignment . on the other hand , inhomogeneous spin states in the bulk of a material ( with @xmath0 )",
    "go along with a magnetodipolar interaction field , which has an important impact on magnetic properties .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction  one of the most fundamental interactions in condensed - matter physics  is still the subject of current research .",
    "for instance , it gives rise to anomalous features in the ground - state correlations and in the spin - wave excitation spectrum of 2d spin systems consisting of cold polar molecules , @xcite and it is vital for the understanding of spin - ice physics , where frustration , dipolar ferromagnetic coupling , exotic field - induced phase transitions , and unusual glassiness are of relevance ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .   for recent reviews ) .",
    "recent experiments on pdfe islands on are square lattice using photoemission electron microscopy @xcite even indicate that pole interactions of higher order than the dipolar one are required in order to understand the ground - state ordering features of such a system .    while classical `` standard '' magnetometry provides only integral information about the magnetic state of the sample , scattering techniques , in particular , magnetic neutron scattering yield spatially and time - resolved information about magnetic media .",
    "a further important difference between magnetometry and magnetic neutron scattering relates to the impact of the magnetodipolar interaction : the quantity of interest in an elastic magnetic neutron scattering experiment , the differential scattering cross section @xmath1 , depends in a _ twofold _",
    "manner on the magnetodipolar interaction .",
    "first , and different from magnetization measurements , the interaction of the magnetic moment of the neutron with the sample s magnetization results in dipolar selection rules which are embodied , _",
    "e.g. _ , by the appearance of trigonometric functions in @xmath1 ( via the halpern - johnson vector ) .",
    "@xcite second , the dipole - dipole interaction between the magnetic moments in the sample has a direct impact on its magnetization structure and therefore on the fourier components of the magnetization .",
    "the former determine the magnetization ( as measured by magnetometry ) and the latter the properties of @xmath1 .",
    "traditionally , the influence of lattice defects on the magnetization of bulk magnetic materials is studied by analyzing magnetization curves in the approach - to - saturation regime .",
    "early investigations by brown , @xcite using the continuum theory of micromagnetics , provide analytic expressions describing different types of defects . from the neutron - scattering point of view",
    ", it is well known that the spin perturbations that are related to imperfections give rise to a strong magnetic scattering signal  the so - called spin - misalignment scattering  along the forward direction ( at small scattering angles ) .",
    "@xcite the size of perturbed regions is characterized by a field - dependent correlation length , which varies between about a few nanometers up to @xmath2 .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to study the role of the magnetodipolar interaction on ( real - space ) magnetic correlations . in particular",
    ", we aim to disentangle the twofold impact of the anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction on magnetic correlation functions obtained from neutron data .",
    "in our analysis we employ our previously developed micromagnetic simulation methodology , which has provided fundamental insights into the magnetic small - angle neutron scattering ( sans ) of various materials .",
    "@xcite the particular strength of this micromagnetic approach is that it takes into account _ site - dependent _ magnetic interactions ( for exchange , magnetic anisotropy , and saturation magnetization ) .",
    "this feature implies that the magnetic microstructure of a wide range of _ polycrystalline _ magnetic materials such as single - phase nanocrystalline magnets , magnetic nanocomposites , or magnetic particles in a nonmagnetic matrix can be studied . as a prime candidate for a system with strong internal dipolar fields and nontrivial magnetization correlations , we have chosen for the present study porous ferromagnets ( iron and cobalt ) , since here local variations in the saturation magnetization are at maximum",
    "our micromagnetic algorithm was originally developed for the computation of the magnetization distribution of magnetic nanocomposites and of the related magnetic - field - dependent sans cross sections . @xcite the four standard contributions to the total magnetic energy ( external field , magnetic anisotropy , exchange and dipolar interaction ) are taken into account . in the simulations presented here ,",
    "the sample volume @xmath3 was divided into @xmath4 mesh elements , comprising both pores and nanocrystallites . for the later comparison to experimental neutron data on nanocrystalline inert - gas - condensed porous iron ( ref .  )",
    "the volume fraction of pores was chosen as @xmath5 , with randomly placed pore centers . due to the flexibility of the mesh - generation algorithm , the shape of the pores can be controlled and was taken to be polyhedron - like .",
    "the pore - size distribution was assumed to be lognormal @xcite with a median of @xmath6 and a variance of @xmath7 , which yields a maximum of the distribution at @xmath8 .",
    "saturation magnetization of each ( iron ) nanocrystallite was taken @xmath9 , which in conjunction with the above mentioned porosity value yields @xmath10 for the entire sample .",
    "for the exchange - stiffness constant and the first cubic anisotropy constant of iron , we have , respectively , assumed values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( ref .  ) .",
    "the direction of anisotropy axes varies randomly from crystallite to crystallite .",
    "the energy - minimization procedure provides ( at some particular value of the applied magnetic field ) the magnetization vector field @xmath13 $ ] of the sample on an _ irregular _ lattice .",
    "this distribution is then mapped onto a _ regular _ lattice , which permits us to calculate the magnetization fourier coefficients and the ensuing neutron scattering cross section using fast fourier transformation .",
    "further details can be found in refs .  .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] displays the numerically computed spin misalignment @xmath14 in the vicinity of a nanopore together with the transversal fourier coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; these fourier components will be used later on when discussing magnetic neutron scattering . the discontinuity ( jump ) of the magnetization at the pore - matrix interphase ( @xmath17 )",
    "gives rise to a strong magnetostatic field and to the characteristic dipole - field - type spin texture .",
    "the symmetry of the @xmath18 distribution corresponds to the field of a magnetic dipole located at the center of the pore and aligned opposite to the external field direction , as depicted by the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . both transversal fourier components are highly anisotropic , whereas the longitudinal one @xmath19 is isotropic ( data not shown ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the angular anisotropy of both @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a consequence of the internal magnetodipolar field , which is the only long - range ( nonlocal ) anisotropic interaction in our micromagnetic modeling ; neglecting this energy term results in @xmath20 and @xmath21 being isotropic .",
    "@xcite    however , in contrast to our previous results , @xcite where @xmath20 was found to be _ isotropic _ , the present simulations reveal an _ anisotropic _ @xmath20 fourier coefficient ( which is enhanced along the field direction ) .",
    "this finding is due to a corrected averaging procedure , which takes into account magnetic fluctuations also along the @xmath22 direction , which coincides with the direction of the incident neutron beam in a sans experiment ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "specifically , the computed ( mapped on a regular grid ) spin structure of the sample , @xmath23 , is divided into thin slices @xmath24 ( with a typical thickness of @xmath25 ) .",
    "this results in a set of magnetization distributions @xmath26 , and fourier transformation then yields the @xmath27 .",
    "the squared fourier coefficients @xmath28 etc .  are summed up and divided by the number of slices in order to obtain the averaged quantities .    as mentioned above",
    ", the possibility to compute the individual fourier components allows one to compare the simulation results with experimental data for the spin - misalignment sans cross section , which reads ( for the scattering geometry where @xmath29 is applied perpendicular to the incoming neutron beam ) : @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the scattering volume , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 denotes the angle between the momentum - transfer vector @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is the complex conjugate of @xmath37 ) .",
    "note that @xmath1 represents the part of the total unpolarized sans cross section @xmath38 which is exclusively due to transversal spin misalignment , with corresponding fourier amplitudes @xmath39 and @xmath40 ; in other words , @xmath1 is obtained by subtracting the nuclear and magnetic sans at complete saturation , @xmath41 , from the measured @xmath38 at lower fields .",
    "the trigonometric functions and the @xmath42-containing cross term in eq .",
    "( [ sigmasansperp ] ) are due to the neutron - magnetic interaction , while the fourier components @xmath43 may additionally depend on the internal magnetodipolar interaction , _",
    "e.g. _ , the anisotropy of the dipolar interaction is embodied in the dependence of the @xmath44 on the angle @xmath33 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . due to the complexity of this expression , the fourier transform of @xmath1 , which one may call the correlation function of the spin - misalignment sans cross section , does not represent , of course , the autocorrelation function of the magnetization .",
    "this is in contrast to the well - known result from nuclear scattering , where the nuclear scattering cross section @xmath45 is equal to the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the nuclear density : @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the so - called excess scattering - length density , and @xmath48 is the ( constant ) average scattering - length density , which only gives a contribution to @xmath49 at @xmath50 .    in order to compare the results for the correlation function of the spin - misalignment sans cross section , @xmath51 with the autocorrelation function of the magnetization spin misalignment , @xmath52 ,",
    "which is not decorated by the neutron - magnetic interaction , we define the latter as follows : @xcite @xmath53 using the convolution theorem , this expression can be rewritten as @xmath54 note the additional difference between both correlation functions : @xmath55 involves only a 2d integration over @xmath56 space , because @xmath1 is experimentally accessible only in the plane perpendicular to the incoming neutron beam [ small - angle approximation : @xmath34 ] , whereas @xmath58 is naturally obtained by a 3d fourier transformation [ due to @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "therefore , in order to compare both correlation functions , we have to employ for the computation of @xmath58 the _ same _ averaged 2d fourier components @xmath20 and @xmath21 that enter @xmath1 , _ i.e. _ , the integration in eq .",
    "( [ csmdef ] ) is also only carried out over the @xmath60 plane .    before discussing the correlations functions , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] a comparison between the experimental ( spin - misalignment ) sans cross section of nanoporous iron @xcite and the results of the micromagnetic simulations .",
    "the simulation data exhibit an overall good agreement with the experimental data and the anisotropic character of @xmath1 is clearly reproduced ; this supports the validity of our micromagnetic simulation methodology .    the correlation functions at @xmath61 , obtained using eqs .",
    "( [ cmdef ] ) and ( [ csmconvol ] ) , are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] along the horizontal ( @xmath62 ) and vertical ( @xmath63 ) direction .",
    "one recognizes the existence of anisotropic correlations already for the autocorrelation function of the spin misalignment ( not influenced by the interaction between neutrons and magnetic moments ) , which may be expected due to the long - range and anisotropic nature of the magnetodipolar interaction ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) ; the difference between both directions is significant ( in particular for @xmath64 ) with @xmath58 along the vertical direction being exclusively positive definite , while @xmath58 along the horizontal direction intersects the @xmath65-axis at @xmath66 and possesses a global minimum at @xmath67 .",
    "the existence of anticorrelations in @xmath58 around the particular @xmath65-value is a manifestation of the typical magnetization distribution @xmath18 around a pore ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , which is due to the configuration of the magnetodipolar field in the vicinity of such an inclusion .",
    "namely , the perpendicular magnetization component changes its sign along the direction of applied field at a distance comparable with the pore diameter . of course , the zeros and global minima of the correlation functions are dependent on the applied magnetic field .",
    "we point out ( see also explanations above ) that the difference between the correlation functions corresponding to both approaches  neutron scattering and micromagnetics  is also significant , in particular , for @xmath68 .",
    "the situation becomes even more interesting if the magnetic system possesses a second symmetry breaking ( in addition to the symmetry breaking caused by the external magnetic field ) .",
    "it can lead to the formation of _ nontrivial 3d correlations _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , the correlation lengths of the magnetization distribution can be significantly different along the three coordinate axes .",
    "one can observe this effect , _",
    "e.g. _ , by introducing an antisymmetric exchange contribution to the total energy , also called dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , favoring the formation of spin canting .",
    "another example for a magnetic system with nontrivial 3d correlations is a polycrystalline magnet with a nonisotropic ( _ e.g. _ , in - plane ) distribution of anisotropy axes of the individual grains ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . here",
    ", we have simulated this situation for the case of nanoporous cobalt .",
    "the choice of this material was motivated by the strong _ uniaxial _ anisotropy [ @xmath69 ( ref .  ) ] .",
    "the random 2d distribution of anisotropy axes is in the @xmath70-plane .",
    "all structural parameters including the porosity value are the same as we used for the simulations on porous iron .",
    "the _ local _",
    "saturation magnetization and the exchange - stiffness constant of cobalt were , respectively , taken as @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( ref .  ) .",
    "the simulation results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] as isosurfaces of the 3d magnetization fourier components @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "one can clearly see that both fourier components are strongly influenced by the magnetodipolar interaction , which results in a 3d clover - leaf - shaped pattern that was already presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as a projection into the plane @xmath75 .",
    "but the most important observation is that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are qualitatively different ( for a direct qualitative comparison one should rotate , _",
    "e.g. _ , the @xmath20 component around @xmath76 taking into account the relation between the fourier components and the coordinate system ) . the magnetodipolar `` structure '' in @xmath21 is more pronounced , since the corresponding coordinate vector @xmath77 is perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropy axes in the sample .",
    "this result shows that the magnetic correlations in porous cobalt with an in - plane distribution of anisotropy axes have a nontrivial 3d character .",
    "the components can not be fully matched by rotation around @xmath76 , in contrast to the case of a 3d random distribution of anisotropy axes ( see the results on porous iron above ) .",
    "using micromagnetic simulations we have computed the magnetization distribution of nanoporous ferromagnets ( iron and cobalt ) which exhibits strong dipolar correlations due to nanoscale spatial variations of the magnitude of the magnetization .",
    "the results were used in order to compute the correlation function of the spin - misalignment sans cross section , which is affected in a twofold manner by the magnetodipolar interaction , and the autocorrelation function of the spin misalignment , which by contrast depends only on the magnetization distribution .",
    "our approach was validated by comparing the simulation results with experimental neutron data . as a consequence of the long - range and anisotropic character of the internal magnetodipolar field",
    ", we find strongly _ anisotropic _ magnetic correlations .",
    "our results demonstrate the importance of the magnetodipolar interaction for understanding magnetic neutron scattering .",
