    "until the observation of accelerated expansion of our universe , the only types of singularities that were considered to appear in friedman - lematre - robinson - walker ( flrw ) cosmological models were singularities in the form of a big bang or a big crunch , for which the density of the matter content of the spacetime blows up @xcite , as well as the scale factor of the universe .",
    "however , since the observational value of the barotropic index of the universe nowadays ( the quotient between the pressure and the density of the content of the universe , @xmath2 ) is around minus one , there is a possibility of violation of the energy conditions and new types of singularities could appear .",
    "in fact , such singularities appear naturally in gravitational theories which try to cope with the observed phenomena .",
    "many of these new singularities are included in a descriptive classification due to nojiri , odintsov and tsujikawa ( n.o.t . in the following ) , which takes into account which physical quantities ( scale factor of the universe @xmath3 , hubble ratio @xmath4 , pressure @xmath5 or density @xmath6 ) are singular @xcite :    * big bang / crunch : vanishing @xmath3 , divergent @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "* type i : `` big rip '' : infinite @xmath3 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 @xcite . *",
    "type ii : `` sudden '' : finite @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath6 , divergent @xmath7 and @xmath5 @xcite . *",
    "type iii : `` big freeze '' : finite @xmath3 , infinite @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "* type iv : finite @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath7 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 , but infinite higher derivatives of @xmath3 .    the strength of these singularities @xcite has been checked in @xcite . summarizing ,",
    "big rip singularities are strong whereas sudden @xcite , big freeze and type iv singularities are weak . in this sense , the latter can not be taken as the final stage of the universe , since the spacetime could be extended continuously beyond the singularity .    out of this scheme ,",
    "directional singularities for which some observers experience an infinite curvature , though the curvature scalars vanish at the singularity , have been found in some theories @xcite .    also out of this classification , in @xcite a flrw cosmology",
    "is shown in which only the barotropic index @xmath0 becomes infinite at @xmath8 , @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 a natural number , whereas the scale factor , @xmath12 , and all its derivatives remain finite and the density and the pressure vanish at @xmath13 . in @xcite",
    "similar singularities are obtained but with non - vanishing pressure .",
    "this new type of singularities has been dubbed barotropic index @xmath0-singularities @xcite , or simply @xmath0-singularities , or even type v @xcite singularities , remarking the difference between them and type iv singularities , since no higher derivatives of the scale factor blow up at the time of the singularity @xmath13 .    in this talk",
    "we would like to show a characterization of barotropic index @xmath0-singularities in flrw cosmologies in terms of the form of the scale factor .",
    "more details may be found in @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we derive a characterization of barotropic index @xmath0-singularities in terms of the exponents of the power expansion in time of the scale factor of the universe .",
    "a discussion of the results is included in the last section .",
    "in gravitational theories such as general relativity , the content of the universe is depicted as a perfect fluid of density @xmath6 and pressure @xmath5 , depending on just the time coordinate @xmath14 , due to the homogeneity and isotropy of flrw spacetimes .",
    "this means that there is an equation of state for the perfect fluid , @xmath15 , and the ratio of pressure and density is defined as the barotropic index of the fluid , @xmath2 .",
    "this index evolves with time except for power - law cosmologies , which have a constant barotropic index .    in flat flrw cosmologies",
    "the barotropic index is written in terms of the scale factor of the universe and its derivatives , @xmath16 @xmath17 and if we assume that it may be expanded as a generalized power expansion of time around the time of the singularity @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20,  are real numbers , the barotropic index can be expanded accordingly , @xmath21 and the exponents and coefficients of this expansion can be written in terms of the former ones .",
    "this gives rise to a hierarchy of cases and subcases depending on the values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite that are consigned in table  [ tablw ] .",
    "we notice that infinite barotropic indices appear just for vanishing @xmath19 exponent , except for @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "llll @xmath24 & @xmath25 & @xmath26 & @xmath27 + nonzero & @xmath28 & @xmath29 & finite + zero & @xmath30 & @xmath29 & infinite + & @xmath31 & @xmath32 & infinite + & @xmath31 & @xmath33 & finite + & @xmath34 & @xmath35 & infinite +    the requirement of finite derivatives of the scale factor implies that all exponents @xmath36 must be natural numbers .",
    "hence , we are left just with the subcase of infinite barotropic index with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    from ( [ prho ] ) and ( [ expan ] )",
    "we learn that vanishing density requires @xmath39 and vanishing pressure requires @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "hence we see that an infinite barotropic index with finite derivatives of the scale factor of the universe requires a vanishing density at the time of the singularity but not a vanishing pressure .",
    "this may be summarized in the following statement : + * theorem : * a flrw cosmological model has an infinite barotropic index at a finite time @xmath41 with finite derivatives of the scale factor of the universe if and only if @xmath42 can be expanded as a taylor series at @xmath13 with a null linear term , @xmath43 furthermore if we require a vanishing pressure either ( barotropic index @xmath0-singularity ) , the quadratic term @xmath44 is also to be zero .",
    "we have shown a simple characterization of barotropic index @xmath0-singularities in flrw cosmological models in terms of taylor expansions of the scale factor of the universe .",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition is just the vanishing of the linear term of the expansion . and",
    "if we consider singularities with vanishing pressure , then both the linear and quadratic terms must be zero .",
    "most exotic singularities are weak in the sense that when we consider finite objects they are not disrupted by tidal forces on experiencing the singularity , since the spacetime can be extended continuously beyond the singular event @xcite .    in that reference ,",
    "the strength of the singularities was checked in terms of the exponents of the expansion ( [ expan ] ) of the scale factor of the universe .",
    "though barotropic index @xmath0-singularities were not considered , the results obtained there are general enough to be applied to cosmological models with vanishing linear term . in fact , it was shown that singularities in cosmological models with @xmath37 and @xmath20 larger or equal than one were weak @xcite with both tipler @xcite and krlak s @xcite criteria .",
    "hence barotropic index @xmath0-singularities are weak and can not be considered as a final stage for the universe , as it happens with other exotic singularities but big rip .    in table",
    "[ scale ] we summarize our results on exotic singularities and their strength in terms of the exponents of the power expansion of the scale factor of the universe around the time of the singularity .",
    "singularities in the derivatives of the scale factor of the universe appear only for non - natural exponents in the expansion .",
    "this is the reason for including a column @xmath45 which deals with that fact .",
    "the letter i ( independent ) means no additional condition on the exponents of the expansion around the time of the singularity .",
    "s ( some ) states that there must be at least one non - natural exponent in order to have a singularity in one of the derivatives .",
    "finally , n ( natural ) means that all exponents are natural .",
