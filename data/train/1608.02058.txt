    "the surface integral or boundary integral formulation of frequency domain electromagnetics was establised by the classic works of poggio & miller  @xcite , chang & harrington  @xcite and wu & tsai  @xcite ( pmchwt ) over 40 years ago and has been widely used ever since . in the pmchwt formulation , the electric and magnetic fields , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "are given in terms of electric and magnetic surface currents or equivalently scalar and vector potentials  @xcite that are found by solving surface integral equations .",
    "the fields @xmath0 and @xmath1 are then obtained by post - processing the surface current values .",
    "many numerical methods have been developed to solve the surface current integral equations .",
    "a popular scheme is to use the rao - wilton - glisson ( rwg )  @xcite basis functions that enforce charge conservation to represent the surface currents on planar triangular surface elements .",
    "it has been pointed out recently that this development is still not without challenges  @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of field quantities gives rise to integral equations with hypersingular kernels due to dyadic green s functions  @xcite that introduces additional numerical difficulties in the long wavelength limit  @xcite .",
    "the well - known analytical solution of the scattering of an electromagnetic plane wave by a single sphere uses two scalar debye potentials that satisfy the scalar helmholtz equation  @xcite .",
    "here , motivated by the conciseness of this approach , we develop a fundamental reformulation of electromagnetics that works directly with field variables that satisfy scalar helmholtz equations .",
    "in contrast to pmchwt , it is not necessary to solve for surface current densities as intermediate quantities .",
    "the scalar helmholtz equations for the field components are solved by a recently developed boundary integral method in which all surface integrals have singularity - free integrands  @xcite .",
    "thus the consequential advantages are : ( i )  components of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are computed directly ; ( ii )  field quantities at or near surfaces can be calculated without loss of precision ; ( iii )  geometries where different parts of surfaces are very close together do not have detrimental effects on the numerical accuracy ; ( iv )  the ease with which higher order surface elements can be used to represent boundaries more accurately enables the boundary integrals to be evaluated using standard quadrature and yet confer high numerical accuracy with fewer degrees of freedom and ( v )  the accuracy of the numerical implementation means that the effect of any resonant solutions of the helmholtz equation are negligible unless the wavenumber is extremely close to the resonant values , so that the resonant solution should not affect practical applications if the present approach is used .",
    "we illustrate our electromagnetics formulation with the scattering problem by 3d perfect electrical conductors ( pec ) . in the frequency domain with time dependence @xmath2 , the propagating electric field @xmath0 in a source free region",
    "is given by the wave equation ( @xmath3 ) : @xmath4 since @xmath5 , there are only two independent components of @xmath0 in  ( [ eq : maxwell ] ) and they are found by specifying the incident field , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the position vector , and imposing the boundary condition that the tangential components of @xmath0 must vanish on the surface , @xmath8 of the pec .    the condition @xmath5 can be replaced using a vector identity for ( @xmath9 ) to give @xmath10 the results in ( [ eq : helm_e ] ) and ( [ eq : helm_xe ] ) were first demonstrated explicitly by lamb for elastic vibrations  @xcite , but have significant relevance to electromagnetics in that @xmath0 is determined directly by a coupled set of 4 scalar helmholtz equations : @xmath11 that we will solve by the boundary integral method .",
    "the scalar functions @xmath12 denote one of the 3 components of @xmath0 or @xmath13 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : helm_e ] ) furnishes 3 relations between the 6 unknowns : @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the outward unit normal of the surface , @xmath8 of the solution domain .",
    "equation ( [ eq : helm_xe ] ) between @xmath19 and @xmath20 provides one more relation between @xmath14 and @xmath15 since : @xmath21 .",
    "the electromagnetic boundary conditions on the continuity of the tangential components of @xmath0 provide the remaining 2 equations to determine @xmath0 and @xmath22 completely .    for scattering by a pec ,",
    "it is more convenient to work in terms of the normal component , @xmath23 , and two tangential components , @xmath24 , of the electric field at the surface . in the pec case",
    ", there are 4 unknowns to be determined , namely : @xmath25 because the tangential components of the electric field must vanish on the surface of a pec .",
    "we decompose @xmath0 into a sum of the incident , @xmath26 and the scattered field , @xmath27 so on the surface of the pec , the tangential components of the scattered field cancel those of the incident field .",
    "physically , @xmath28 is proportional to the induced surface charge density on the pec .",
    "thus the number of unknowns to be found is the same as for the classic solution of the scattering problem by a pec sphere using a pair of scalar debye potentials in which the 2 unknown functions and their derivatives have to be found  @xcite .",
    "however , in the debye potential approach , the electromagnetic boundary conditions are expressed as combinations of the two potentials and components of their gradients on the surface of the pec and give rise to equations that are not straightforward to solve in the framework of the boundary integral method .",
    "the boundary integral solution of  ( [ eq : helm_p ] ) for the scattered field is based on green s second identity that gives a relation between @xmath12 and its normal derivative @xmath29 at points @xmath30 and @xmath31 on the boundary , @xmath8 .",
    "all singularities associated with the green s function @xmath32 , can be removed analytically to give  @xcite @xmath33 \\frac{\\partial { g } } { { \\partial { n } } } ds(\\boldsymbol{r } } ) = \\qquad \\nonumber",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the requirement on @xmath34 and @xmath35 is simply that they satisfy the helmholtz equation with the following boundary conditions : @xmath36 on the surface , @xmath8 at @xmath37 .",
    "examples of possible choices of @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be found in  @xcite .",
    "thus if @xmath38 ( or @xmath29 ) is given , then  ( [ eq : ns_bie ] ) can be solved for @xmath29 ( or @xmath38 ) in a straightforward manner .",
    "the reason is that for @xmath34 and @xmath35 that obey the above conditions , the terms that multiply @xmath39 and @xmath40 vanish faster than the rate of divergence of @xmath39 or @xmath40 as @xmath41 and consequently both integrals have non - singular integrands and can thus be evaluated accurately by quadrature , see  @xcite for details .    with the removal of all singular behavior and without the need to represent surface current densities ,",
    "quadratic surface elements can be used to represent the surface accurately .",
    "this can provide orders of magnitude improvement in the numerical integration over standard methods ( with singular integrands ) for the same number of degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "once the field quantities are known on the boundary , values in the 3d solution domain , even at locations close to the boundaries can be obtained easily and accurately since the boundary integral equations are not singular  @xcite .    the formulation for the magnetic field",
    ", @xmath1 is similar : @xmath42 but at pec boundaries , ( [ eq : helm_xh ] ) is equivalent to the simpler condition that the normal component of @xmath1 vanishes on the pec : @xmath43 to apply the boundary condition on the tangential components of @xmath0 , we choose two orthogonal unit tangents @xmath44 and @xmath45 on @xmath8 , and use ampere s law to express the component of @xmath0 parallel to @xmath44 , namely , @xmath46 , in terms of @xmath1 @xmath47 the second equality in ( [ eq : et_eq_0 ] ) follows from the electric field boundary condition on the pec surface , @xmath8 .    our formulation for pec problems for @xmath1 , in ( [ eq : helm_h ] ) - ( [ eq : et_eq_0 ] ) , is slightly more complex than our formulation for @xmath0 , in ( [ eq : helm_e ] ) - ( [ eq : helm_xe ] ) , because of the need to use ( [ eq : et_eq_0 ] ) to impose the pec boundary condition for @xmath0 .",
    "note also that if @xmath1 is a solution of ( [ eq : helm_h ] ) , ( [ eq : helm_xh ] ) and ( [ eq : et_eq_0 ] ) , @xmath48 is also a solution where @xmath49 is an arbitrary solution of the helmholtz equation .",
    "but clearly , @xmath0 obtained from @xmath1 or @xmath48 , using ampere s law , will be identical and independent of @xmath49 .",
    "so for solving practical pec problems , ( [ eq : helm_e ] ) - ( [ eq : helm_xe ] ) should be used to solve for @xmath0 , and @xmath1 can either be found from @xmath0 or from solving ( [ eq : helm_h ] ) , ( [ eq : hn_eq_0 ] ) and ( [ eq : et_eq_0 ] ) .",
    "we show how the solution of ( [ eq : helm_e ] ) and ( [ eq : helm_xe ] ) for the electric field @xmath0 on the surface of a pec scatterer can be formulated as a system of linear equations that is the discretized representation of 4 non - singular boundary integral equations ( [ eq : ns_bie ] ) for the solution of 3 scalar helmholtz equations for the three components of @xmath0 and an additional scalar helmholtz equation for ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the total field , @xmath0 , can be written as the sum of the incident and scattered field : @xmath51 .",
    "clearly the known incident field , @xmath52 , such as a plane wave , satisfies ( [ eq : helm_e ] ) and ( [ eq : helm_xe ] ) , so we only need to solve for the unknown scattered field , @xmath53 . on the surface of an object , it is convenient to work in terms of the normal and tangential components of the scattered field : @xmath54 . since the tangential component of the total field",

    "thus relative to the current - based surface integral formulation that requires further post processing by taking numerical derivatives of the surface current to obtain the surface fields , the present approach yields the surface fields directly at the expense of working with a larger number of degrees of freedom , but this is compensated by the ability to use quadratic elements that can furnish higher precision with fewer unknowns .",
