    "interaction of heavy quarks with hot dense matter , created in heavy ion collisions at rhic , is a very important probe for understanding the properties of the produced medium . for the case of the light quark",
    ", the strong suppression of high transverse momentum pions has been experimentally measured @xcite .",
    "this important result implies that hard scattered partons traveling through the medium created in such collisions experience considerable energy loss . the same effect for heavy quarks is predicted to be smaller than for the light quarks due to a suppression of the phase space for gluon radiation for large masses of the quarks ( the so called `` dead cone '' effect @xcite ) . due to the interaction of heavy quarks with the medium , heavy flavor particle is expected to exhibit none zero elliptic flow @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the strength of the heavy quark flow in combination with the degree of heavy quark suppression provide crucial information on the nature of the heavy quark interaction with the medium and are therefore very important for the understanding of the medium properties @xcite .",
    "phenix has developed robust and accurate methods @xcite of measuring the heavy quark production by disentangling the electron contribution from the semi - leptonic decays of the open charm / bottom particles ( this contribution is denoted as _ `` non - photonic '' _ electrons ) from the electrons created from the conventional sources ( dalitz decays of light mesons , photon - conversions in the detector material - referred to as _",
    "`` photonic '' _ electrons ) . the first method , `` cocktail '' subtraction , is based on simulating the `` photonic '' electron component with hadron decay generator using published pion results @xcite as input .",
    "the second analysis technique , `` converter '' subtraction , is based upon direct measurement of the `` photonic '' electron contribution from a special set of runs with increased conversion material budget .    here",
    "we present results obtained from the experimental data , collected during the year 2004 high statistics phenix run and year 2003 run .",
    "a minimum bias sample of @xmath5 events was analyzed for using the beam - beam counter ( bbc ) as a trigger source .",
    "compared to the published results @xcite , this gives a factor of 100 statistical improvement , another factor of two due to increased acceptance , and the photonic background was reduced by a factor of two because of the removal of the central vertex detector . for the results ,",
    "the low part come from the @xmath6 minimum bias events while the high part come from the events firing the level-1 electron trigger ( ert ) corresponding effectively to @xmath7 minimum bias events . comparing to the previous results @xcite",
    ", the luminosity is increased five times and electron acceptance improved by a factor of four .",
    "the total material budget of the phenix detector corresponded to @xmath8 0.7% @xmath9 radiation length from the beam pipe ( @xmath10 ) and air ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the inclusive electron invariant cross section was corrected for the acceptance and efficiency .",
    "the comparison of inclusive electron spectra with the `` cocktail '' prediction for `` photonic '' electron background clearly indicated an excess of the electrons .",
    "the subtracted `` non - photonic '' electron yields for different centrality bins are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : non_photonic ] . a fit to the data @xcite , scaled by corresponding number of binary collisions ,",
    "is also shown on the plot .",
    "one can clearly see that for the most peripheral bin ( @xmath12 ) the data agrees with the reference and that a high - suppression of the electron yield starts developing towards more central collisions .",
    "to quantify the suppression , we use the nuclear modification factor @xcite which is a ratio of the invariant electron yield to the cross section , scaled by the nuclear thickness function @xmath13 . for the most central bin ( @xmath14 centrality )",
    "is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : raa_0_10 ] . the systematic error for the ratio",
    "was separated in three pieces : the error on @xmath13 , the systematic error on the data and on the reference .",
    "the comparison with the published theoretical predictions @xcite shows that the data supports theories with large transport coefficient ( @xmath15 ) or a very high initial gluon density ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "this is a very challenging task for a theory to justify such high values of these parameters , but realistic values of gluon densities ( @xmath17 ) significantly underestimate the heavy flavor suppression .",
    "it is also very important to mention that in order to make a reasonable theoretical prediction , one needs to include the electron contribution from open charm and open bottom semi - leptonic decays .",
    "azimuthal flow of the open charm / bottom particles can be studied indirectly by disentangling @xmath3 of the `` non - photonic '' electrons . published results from the year 2002 phenix run",
    "@xcite did not provide enough resolving power to make a clear statement on whether the heavy quarks flow . using the much higher statistics of the year 2004 run ,",
    "we obtain much more significant results .",
    "the basic idea of the measurement is clearly shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : flow_inclusive ] .",
    "the inclusive electron @xmath3 was measured from the data , then the `` photonic '' electron @xmath3 was estimated using an analog of the `` converter '' subtraction technique for low and simulated through the `` cocktail '' from measured flow of the pions for high .",
    "then the flow of `` non - photonic '' electrons can be calculated , knowing the relative contribution of `` non - photonic '' electrons in the inclusive spectrum .",
    "results of this analysis are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : flow_nonphot ] in comparison with theoretical calculations for the electron @xmath3 under the assumptions that the charm quark participates in the collective flow or just picks up the flow from the light quark .",
    "one can see that at @xmath18 gev / c the data are definitely in good agreement with the theoretical predictions in which charm flow is assumed .",
    "however in the high region though , the magnitude of the flow saturates and decreases . one possible explanation of this behavior is a contribution of electrons from open bottom decay .",
    "the bottom quark is assumed to have a lower @xmath3 which may cause the large drop of the `` non - photonic '' electron elliptic flow .",
    "compared with theoretical predictions for charm quark flow @xcite . ]",
    "compared with theoretical predictions for charm quark flow @xcite . ]",
    "during the year 2003/2004 run the phenix experiment accumulated a significant amount of electron data in both and colliding systems .",
    "new data dramatically improved the statistical significance of the previously published heavy flavor measurements in the single electron channel .",
    "observation of strong suppression of the `` non - photonic '' electron spectrum developing towards more central collisions is a very important result , providing significant constraint on the theoretical description of heavy - quark energy loss mechanisms .",
    "the results of the `` non - photonic '' electron elliptic flow measurements clearly indicate sizable @xmath4 of the open charm particles .",
