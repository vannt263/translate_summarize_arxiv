    "this is in contrast with the model defined either with the metric constraint or with an elastic energy of at least quartic order ( @xmath309 ) where the roughness exponent is physical @xmath310 and actually takes a value @xmath311 @xcite that can be understood in terms of pinning by directed percolation clusters @xcite .    in conclusion , since the microscopic model with an elastic quadratic energy ( case @xmath301 ) is known to lead to unphysical results at the depinning transition ( @xmath308 ) , it is clearly not a good starting point to study the general phase diagram for the dynamics at finite temperature and finite force . on the contrary ,",
    "the metric constraint is always a safe choice , since by definition it can not produce an unphysical roughness strictly larger than one .",

    "the question is then : in the effective directed trap model described in section [ interactingtrap ] , what is the corresponding renormalized interactions between two consecutive segments of typical length @xmath50 representing local quasi - equilibrated metastable states ? in the absence of more refined arguments , we feel that the metric constraint is actually also an appropriate renormalized interaction , since it prevents the appearance of an unphysical roughness @xmath292 and it allows all possible physically acceptable values @xmath293 for the roughness .",
