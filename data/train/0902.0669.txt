    "1d zigzag and armchair graphene ribbons , sided with two parallel zigzag and armchair structures along the longitudinal direction , respectively , are intensively studied .",
    "many theoretical studies predict that a zigzag ribbon has peculiar edge states .",

    "this stacked system exhibits the anisotropic energy dispersions between in - ribbon - pane and the stacking direction for the intraribbon coupling is much stronger than the interribbon interaction .",
    "moreover , the interribbon interactions also modify the in - ribbon - pane electronic properties , such as state energies , energy dispersions , band - edge states , and size of band gap .",

    "@xmath211 is the joint density of states and @xmath212 is the velocity matrix element.@xcite according to the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , the magnitude of velocity matrix is @xmath213 , where @xmath214 is proportional to @xmath215 , the projection of the envelope function of initial state , @xmath216 , onto that of final state , @xmath217 .",
    "the subscript @xmath218 ( _ inter - ribbon _ ) denotes the initial and final states located at the same ( different ) ribbons .",
    "the @xmath218-projection , for example , is @xmath219 the velocity matrix element @xmath212 depends on the spatial symmetries of the initial and final states and , thus , determines the selection rule and the effective transition channels.@xcite at @xmath92 , only the intraribbon optical transition , @xmath220 , makes contribution to the velocity matrix element @xmath214 .",
    "there is only one group of subbands , i.e. , @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "therefore , the optical selection rule is predicted to be @xmath223 , where @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "the selection rule is the same as that of a monolayer graphene ribbon.@xcite    away from @xmath92 , there are four possible optical transition channels @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 and @xmath229 [ fig .",
    "6(b ) ] . according to the spatial symmetry of envelope functions , the corresponding selection rules of the four transitions are predicted to be @xmath223 , @xmath230 , @xmath231 , and @xmath232 . the change of the state energies caused by interribbon interactions might alter the peak positions of joint density of states , and the modification of the shape and site amplitude of envelope functions might give rise to the vivid variation of the magnitude of velocity matrix element @xmath212 .",
    "thus , the optical spectra of the ab - stacked ribbon are expected to be more complicated in peak number , peak position and peak height than those of a monolayer or bilayer ribbon . the work to calculate the optical spectra of the ab - stacked ribbon is on - doing .",
    "the peierls coupling tight - binding method is employed to investigate the anisotropic magnetoelectronic structures of multilayer graphene ribbons .",
    "they are strongly dependent on the @xmath84-field strength and the interribbon interactions .",

    "the interribbon interactions significantly affect state degeneracy , energy dispersions , landau plot .",
    "they destroy the symmetry of magnetoband structures .",
    "they also produce concave and convex subbands along @xmath0 .",
    "the magnetoband structures are strongly anisotropic .",
    "there are many doubly degenerate landau levels and singlet 1d curving bands along @xmath1 and @xmath0 directions .",
    "such features are directly reflected in density of states .",
    "dos exhibits a lot of asymmetric prominent peaks , for example , the delta - function - like peak , the 1d power - law divergence , and the compound peak .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0-dependent interribbon interactions modify the shape of wave functions , alter the spatial symmetry , and arouse the change of charge - carrier distribution . the findings are further used to predict the optical selection rule .",
