    "one of the most important and challenging questions in cosmology and particle physics is to understand the nature of the dark energy that is driving the observed cosmic acceleration , see e.g. @xcite . an important approach to this problem is to constrain the properties of dark energy using cosmological probes .",
    "this would provide measurements that would allow one to test various competing models of dark energy .",
    "however , due to a high degeneracy within a narrow range of the parameter space , constraining conclusively dynamical dark energy models is going to be a difficult goal to achieve , and much effort and strategy will be needed .",
    "ultimately , a combination of powerful cosmological probes and tests will be necessary .    in this paper",
    ", we study how dark energy parameters are constrained from different combinations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments , supernovae of type ia ( sne ia ) data , and weak lensing surveys ( wl ) with and without tomography .",
    "in particular , we look for combinations of experiments that will be able to constrain these parameters well enough to settle decisively some of the dark energy questions , say to a few percent . when cmb measurements constrained the total energy density to @xmath13 to a one sigma level @xcite , it became generally more accepted that spatial curvature is negligible .",
    "thus , an uncertainty of a few percent on dark energy parameters could be set as a reasonable goal .",
    "of course , one should bear in mind that it will remain always possible to construct dynamical dark energy models that are indistinguishable from a cosmological constant within these limits , and therefore , one needs to resort to cosmological tests beyond the equation of state measurements . a better scenario providing",
    "a decisive answer would be one in which one could show that dark energy is clearly not a cosmological constant .",
    "it is certainly wise to probe the nature of dark energy using gradual steps .",
    "however , in both the scenarios mentioned above , one should keep in mind that the results and conclusions obtained from an analysis where the equation of state is assumed constant are subject to changes if the equation of state is allowed to vary with the redshift . in this paper , we consider dark energy with a varying equation of state .",
    "we chose the combination cmb+sn ia+wl as various studies have already shown that supernovae type ia constitute a powerful probe of dark energy via distance - redshift measurements , see for example @xcite + @xcite .",
    "also , several parameter forecast studies have shown that combining constraints from weak gravitational lensing with constraints from the cmb is a powerful combination to constrain dark energy ; see , e.g. @xcite + @xcite + @xcite .",
    "importantly , weak lensing measurements are sensitive to both the effect of dark energy on the expansion history and its effect on the growth factor of large - scale structure .",
    "furthermore , in addition to tightening the constraints , using independent probes will allow one to test the systematic errors of each probe , which are serious limiting factors in these studies .",
    "for each of these probes , much data will be available in the near and far future .",
    "for wl , there are many ongoing , planned and proposed surveys , such as the deep lens survey ( http://dls.bell-labs.com/ ) @xcite ; the noao deep survey ( _ http://www.noao.edu/noao/noaodeep/_ ) ; the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) legacy survey ( _ http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/science/cfhls/ _ ) @xcite ; the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( _ http://pan-starrs.ifa.hawaii.edu/_ ) ; the _ supernova acceleration probe _ ( _ snap _ ; _ http://snap.lbl.gov/_ ) @xcite ; and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; _ http://www.lsst.org/lsst_home.html_ ) @xcite .",
    "similarly , there are many ongoing , planned and proposed sne ia surveys , such as the supernova legacy survey @xcite ( snls ) ; the nearby supernova factory ( snfactory ) @xcite ; the essence project @xcite ; sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite ; the carnegie supernova project + @xcite ; and the dark energy camera project @xcite .",
    "we should mention that there are other noteworthy cosmological tools for probing dark energy that we did not consider in this study , notably clusters of galaxies ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) , lyman - alpha forests ( see for example @xcite ) , and baryonic oscillations ( see for example @xcite ) .    for the cmb",
    ", we consider future constraints from 8 years of data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap-8 ) @xcite , 1 year of data from the planck satellite ( planck1 ) , and 1 year of data from the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we use two sets of 2000 supernovae with @xmath14=0.8 and @xmath14=1.5 respectively , and consider two types of cosmic shear surveys : a ground - based like survey covering 70% of the sky with source galaxy redshift distribution having a median redshift @xmath15 , and a space - based like deep survey covering successively 1% , 10% and 70% of the sky with @xmath16 .",
    "we take into account in our analysis systematic limits for the supernovae by adding a systematic uncertainty floor in quadrature following @xcite .",
    "we also include for weak lensing the effect of the redshift bias and the shear calibration bias by adding and marginalizing over the corresponding parameters as in @xcite .",
    "the constraints on the dark energy equation of state are parameterization dependent ; see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "also , there is a smearing effect due to double integration involved when using the equation of state @xcite . in order to partly avoid this ,",
    "one could probe directly the variations in the dark energy density using the data ; see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , it has been argued that the equation of state is closer to the physics , as it also contains information on the pressure , and , trying to probe the equation of state from the density leads to instability and bias @xcite .",
    "therefore , we choose in this analysis to use both and parameterize the dark energy using its density @xmath1 as well as two different parameterizations of its equation of state @xmath0 .",
    "a total set of 13 parameters is considered as follows . for constraints from wl ,",
    "we use : @xmath17 , the physical matter density ; @xmath18,@xmath19 and @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) , respectively the fraction of the critical density in a dark energy component and its equation of state parameters ( see sec . [",
    "sec : de_param ] ( alternatively , we use the dark energy density parameters @xmath22 with @xmath23 ( see section [ sec : de_param ] ) ) ; we use @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the spectral index and running of the primordial scalar power spectrum at @xmath26 ; @xmath27 , the amplitude of linear fluctuations . in order to parameterize some systematics , we include as a parameter @xmath28 , the characteristic redshift of source galaxies ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : z_dist ] ) , as well as @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the calibration parameters as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite which determine the absolute calibration error on the lensing power spectrum , @xcite ) , and the relative calibration between tomography bins ( see sec . [",
    "sec : systematics ] ) .",
    "when we combine this with the cmb , we include @xmath31 , the physical baryon density ; @xmath32 , the optical depth to reionization ; @xmath33 the scalar - tensor fluctuation ratio .",
    "we assume a spatially flat universe with @xmath34 .",
    "this fixes @xmath35 and @xmath36 as functions of the basic parameters .",
    "we do not include massive neutrinos , or primordial isocurvature perturbations .",
    "for the supernova analysis , we use @xmath37 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , ( or @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) and treat the magnitude parameter @xmath40 as a nuisance parameter .",
    "we use the fiducial model ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and add @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .      as mentioned earlier , constraining the dark energy using its equation of state",
    "is known to be parameterization dependent , e.g. @xcite , and also suffers from a smearing due to the double integration involved @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can probe directly the variations of the dark energy density as a function of redshift @xmath1 . on the other hand",
    ", it has been argued that the equation of state contains information on both the density and pressure of the dark energy and using the density to probe the equation of state may lead to instability and bias @xcite .",
    "we chose to study the constraints on dark energy using both approaches .",
    "there are several parameterizations of the dark energy equation of state that have been used to study currently available data or to do parameter constraint projections .",
    "discussions of the advantages and drawbacks of some of these parameterizations can be found in @xcite .",
    "we used here the following two parameterizations , which have no divergence at very large redshift :    \\a ) @xmath54    here @xmath20 represents the redshift derivative of @xmath0 in the recent past as follows ( see , e.g. @xcite ) @xmath55 the evolution of dark energy density with redshift is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57    \\b ) @xmath58    here the equation of state is parameterized as @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the scale factor .",
    "the dark energy density evolves with @xmath61 now given by @xmath62      following @xcite , we parameterize @xmath65 as a continuous function interpolated between today and its amplitude parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 corresponding respectively to z=0.5 and 1.0 , and remaining constant at higher redshifts .",
    "we use a polynomial interpolation as in @xcite so @xmath66 where the parameters @xmath38 , and @xmath39 will be constrained from the data . as suggested in @xcite and + @xcite ,",
    "we could use more density parameters than two as much more data will be available in the future , but we chose to use only two parameters in order to keep the number of parameters equal to the equation of state case and be able to make a fair comparison of the results .",
    "departures of the density parameters from unity will be an indication of a redshift evolution of the dark energy density and will rule out a cosmological constant .",
    ".cmb experiment specifications for planck and act .",
    "the parameters used for wmap 8 years are based on the projection of the one year operation and are described in section 5 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
