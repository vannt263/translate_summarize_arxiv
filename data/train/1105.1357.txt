    "the question arose whether this measure is also meaningful for quantifying the nonlocality of a resource consisting of several copies of a correlation . in a context where nonlocality is more useful the stronger it is this measure is problematic if stronger nonlocality can be obtained from a number of weakly nonlocal correlations .",
    "in other words , we want to know if two parties having access to correlations violating a bell inequality by some small extent can execute local operations to obtain a higher violation .",
    "the two parties can carry out arbitrary local operations , but _ can not _ communicate . this process is called _ nonlocality distillation_.    it has recently been shown that the clauser - horner - shimony - holt inequality  @xcite ( chsh ) as a measure for nonlocality in minimal dimensions is indeed problematic because it is distillable in general  @xcite . a protocol by brunner and skrzypczyk  @xcite manages to distill an arbitrarily weak nonlocal correlation , that is still super - quantum , to the extent where communication complexity collapses . as proposed in @xcite a more meaningful measure , which is by definition undistillable , is the maximal chsh violation achievable from many realizations of a given nonlocal resource by any distillation protocol .",

    "the box - world analogues to bound entanglement and its activation .",
    "hyer and rashid  @xcite thoroughly analyzed different distillation protocols , proved optimality in restricted classes and discovered a strong dependence between the optimal protocol and the parameters of the resource that it distills .",
    "today our knowledge about general distillation protocols is still very limited .",
    "although tools and techniques to analyze fixed protocols exist ( for example by discrete maps  @xcite ) , difficulties arise and the lack of a neat framework becomes obvious when attempting to calculate the distillable nonlocality of a fixed resource . besides what results from some trivial symmetries",
    "not much is known to simplify the task .",
    "it usually requires an exhaustive search over all possible distillation protocols .",
    "the fact that the search space grows doubly exponential in the number of involved correlation copies represents a serious problem for the usefulness and understanding of this alternative nonlocality measure .",
    "therefore , as recently suggested in @xcite , meaningful bounds for distillable nonlocality that can be derived more efficiently are a reasonable compromise .    in this article",
    "we propose such bounds and analyze them .",
    "they rely on a recursive optimization problem that has a strong connection to the process of optimizing distillation protocols for isotropic nonlocality . solved with a dynamic - programming approach our bounds yield an exponential gain in the run - time compared to a brute - force search .",
    "the efficiency advantage enables one to analyze instances with the number of available correlations limited by 9 . to demonstrate this we calculated the distillable nonlocality bounds for a set of fixed isotropic systems and found that , in this context , our bounds rule out distillation and are therefore tight .",
    "furthermore , we present a general idea how to extend isotropic bounds to the non - isotropic case . here , our calculated bounds show that the distillable nonlocality approaches the chsh nonlocality of a single copy when the resource is chosen closer to an isotropic line .",
    "following a general approach to nonlocality  @xcite , we consider correlations in the joint behavior of the two ends of a bipartite input - output _ system _ , characterized by joint probability distributions @xmath0 on random variables @xmath1 for each @xmath2 .",

    "[ fig1 ]    in a distillation setting two parties , alice and bob , sharing a number of systems can independently choose inputs  possibly derived from local outputs of other systems  and collect outputs on their ends of the systems .",
    "in other words , they can apply any classical circuitry to their local parts of the systems .",
    "such a local input - output strategy is called a _ wiring _   @xcite .",
    "a party receives its output from a system immediately after giving its input , independently of whether the other has given its input already .",
    "this prevents the parties from signaling by delaying their inputs . on the other hand it allows for wirings that have a different temporal order on the two sides .",
    "for example : while alice s input into system 2 depends on the output of system 1 , bob s input into system 1 depends on the output of system 2 .",
    "if the temporal order on both sides is equal we call the wiring _ ordered _ and _ disordered _ otherwise . in this paper",
    "we consider both kinds , summarized under general wirings as defined in  @xcite .",
    "since we are only interested in optimality ignoring non - deterministic strategies is sufficient due to convexity .",
    "thus , we are allowed to ignore randomness shared between the two players to simplify the proofs .    here , we assume nonlocality in its simplest form , namely , in the _ binary _ setting where each input and each output has two possible values , i.e. , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a detailed description of the convex polytope of binary nonsignaling systems ( @xmath10 ) . in the case where both inputs and both outputs are binary , the only bell inequality ( up to symmetries )",
    "is the chsh inequality .",
    "furthermore , the set of eight chsh inequalities is complete for binary systems in the sense that if none of them is violated , then the system is local .",
    "a system is called _ isotropic _ if it is a probabilistic mixture of opposite nonlocal vertices of @xmath10 , which are known as pr - boxes  @xcite .",
