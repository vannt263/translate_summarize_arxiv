    "recent years have witnessed tremendous progress in the study of entanglement in condensed matter / many - body physics . among these studies , free fermion systems play a very special role.@xcite simple as they may seem , fermions are intrinsically non - local , due to the _ anti-_commutation relation fermion operators satisfy , no matter how far apart they are .",
    "such non - locality shows up as _ enhanced _ entanglement in the ground state ; for example for many years fermi sea states were the only known ground states whose block entanglement entropy ( ee ) violates the area law satisfied by most ground states above 1d.@xcite it is only recently shown that a similar violation occurs in interacting fermion systems in the fermi liquid phase,@xcite and bosonic models with excitation spectra that vanish on ( extended ) bose surfaces.@xcite the existence of sharp fermi or bose surfaces is crucial for the area law violation in translationally invariant systems .",
    "comparatively much less effort has been devoted to studies of fermions in the presence of disorder potential . in a recent work@xcite we studied two very special ( one - dimensional ) 1d models that exhibit free fermion metal - insulator transition ( mit ) , and found area law violation in the metallic phase , _ despite _ the presence of disorder , and thus absence of sharp fermi surface ( actually points in 1d ) .",
    "it was conjectured@xcite that as long as the system is metallic , namely states are de - localized at the fermi energy , there will be area - law violation . in the present work we test this conjecture by performing detailed numerical studies of the anderson model@xcite in one- , two and three - dimensions .",
    "we find that the area law is actually respected in all cases , including the metallic phase in 3d .",
    "we do observe an enhancement ( beyond area law ) as systems sizes increase while below the mean free path ; such enhancement disappears once the system size becomes sufficiently bigger than the mean free path .",
    "the origin of the difference between the anderson model studied here and the special models studied earlier@xcite will be discussed .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce our model and numerical method for calculating ee .",
    "results of our calculations are presented in sec .",
    "iv offers a summary and discussions on our results .",
    "anderson model in @xmath0 dimension is a model with constant nearest neighbour hopping term and random on - site energy @xmath1 :    @xmath2    where summation is over all sites in @xmath0 dimensional hyper cubic lattice ( with lattice constant set to be 1 ) and @xmath3 is a vector connecting a site to its nearest neighbour .",
    "@xmath1 s are uniformly distributed between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite the fermi energy @xmath6 is set to be 0 ( so the lattice is half - filled ) in all cases , while in 2d we also study @xmath7 to avoid the van hove singularity at the band center .",
    "we consider cubic - shaped finite - size systems with linear size @xmath8 and open - boundary conditions .",
    "we then divide them into two equal subsystems @xmath9 and @xmath10 with size @xmath11 , and calculate the disorder - averaged entanglement entropy as detailed below .    for a system in a pure state @xmath12",
    ", the density matrix is @xmath13 .",
    "reduced density matrix of each subsystem ( a or b ) is obtained by tracing over degrees of freedom of the other subsystem : @xmath14 .",

    "@xmath16 are characterized by free - fermion _ entanglement _ hamiltonians @xmath17 where @xmath18 is determined by the normalization condition @xmath19 .",

    ", all states are localized with any finite disorder .",
    "however there is an important difference between them : in 1d the localization length @xmath24 is of the same order as mean free path @xmath25 , while in 2d we have @xmath26 for weak disorder . in 3d",
    "there is a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) at a critical value of disorder strength @xmath27 , @xcite where @xmath24 diversges .",
    "the focus of our numerical calculation is the interplay of the three different length scales , mean free path @xmath25 ( calculated perturbatively in the appendix ) , localization length @xmath24 , and ( sub)system size @xmath8 , and their effects on entanglement .",
    "in these two cases , all states are localized as long as @xmath28 .    fig .",

    "involves power - law long - range hopping,@xcite and the system is metallic when the decay exponent is small enough . in this case",
    "the fermion can hop over arbitrarily large distances , thus mean free path is not well defined .",
    "more importantly , in the metallic phase fermion motion is _",
    "super_-diffusive,@xcite different from that in 3d anderson model .    combining with earlier results with the present ones ,",
    "we conclude that while violation of entanglement area law does not necessarily require a sharp fermi surface ( which is destroyed by disorder ) , it does not occur in diffusive metals .",
    "it can occur , however , in metallic phases of disordered free fermion models where the fermion motion is super - diffusive .",
    "while in this paper we studied non - interacting fermions , a recent paper studied the role of localization length in the case of interacting fermions.@xcite also another paper@xcite proved the area law in the localized regime of the anderson model , although our numerical calculations demonstrate area law in the the metallic phase as well .    _ note added _  while the present manuscript is being written up , a related preprint@xcite appeared on the arxiv reaching a very similar conclusion .",
