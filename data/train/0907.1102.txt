    "recent observations have confirmed our basic understanding of cosmology and showed an impressive consistency with the predictions of the standard @xmath0cdm model ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this model , a cosmological constant dominates the cosmic mass budget today , but galaxies and other structures were assembled earlier , primarily out of cold dark matter .",
    "this medium of non - interacting , low velocity - dispersion particles , started out with small gaussian density perturbations that were subsequently enhanced by gravity . while the model successfully matches observations of the large - scale anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background and the large - scale structure in galaxy surveys , it is also important to test its validity on smaller scales .",
    "the abundance and structure of non - linear objects are potentially sensitive probes of the properties of dark matter ( e.g. , whether it is cold ) and of the density fluctuations ( e.g. , whether they are gaussian ) . however , gas cooling and astrophysical feedback complicate the interpretation of observations regarding the dark matter distribution in galaxies .",
    "thus , it is most attractive to study the largest virialized objects , namely x - ray clusters , in which most of the gas is too hot and rarefied to cool and is thus expected to trace the gravitational potential .",
    "the mass profiles of galaxy clusters can be measured directly through gravitational lensing .",
    "observations of the most massive clusters now find dozens of multiply - imaged background sources , allowing a precise measurement of the central 2-d mass distribution in each cluster as projected on the sky .",
    "also crucial for characterizing each cluster is its total virial mass , which can be measured precisely by supplementing the central strong lensing signal with weak lensing distortions measured out to the cluster edge .",
    "it is useful to characterize the total , projected profile with one scale , the effective einstein radius @xmath1 ( or angle @xmath2 ) defined so that a circle of that radius around the cluster center contains a mean enclosed surface mass density @xmath3 equal to the critical density for lensing , @xmath4d_{\\rm os}/(d_{\\rm ol } d_{\\rm ls})$ ] , where @xmath5 denotes various angular diameter distances ( observer - source , observer - lens , and lens - source ) .",
    "this definition is motivated by the einstein ring radius of an axisymmetric lens , but is nonetheless a useful measure of the central matter content even for asymmetric clusters .",
    "current n - body simulations of galaxy clusters in @xmath0cdm produce samples of thousands of halos with virial mass @xmath6 .",
    "these simulations are becoming sufficiently large and detailed to yield the predicted spread in cluster halo parameters , and to allow a quantitative assessment of the inherent bias in observing clusters in projection and selecting them by lensing cross - section @xcite .",
    "in general , the density profiles of the simulated clusters are relatively shallow and seemingly at odds with recent careful lensing studies of massive clusters @xcite",
    ".    this discrepancy was recently highlighted and quantified by @xcite , who carefully compared observations of four well - constrained massive clusters to the predictions of the numerical simulations .",
    "they emphasized the importance of comparing directly the projected 2-d mass distributions in the observations and the simulations , using the virial mass ( @xmath7 ) and the effective einstein radius ( @xmath1 ) as two numbers that characterize the degree of concentration in each cluster halo . they derived the theoretical predictions for cluster lensing in @xmath0cdm by starting with the distribution of 3-d halo profiles measured by @xcite in the millennium simulation , and then correcting it for lensing and projection biases based on @xcite . comparing the resulting distribution with the observed @xmath1 for four clusters ",
    "a1689 , cl0024 , a1703 , and rxj1347  and including the expected spread in profiles as well as the measurement errors , they found that each cluster was discrepant at the 2@xmath8 level ( all with an unusually large @xmath1 given @xmath7 ) , yielding a combined 4@xmath8 discrepancy .",
    "@xcite recently found that simulated cluster concentrations are even lower when using the most updated cosmological parameters ( which have a lower power spectrum normalization than assumed by @xcite ) , though the effect for the most massive clusters is only at the level of @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite suggested that gas physics is unlikely to affect significantly the einstein radius of a cluster .",
    "this radius of @xmath10 kpc is typically observed to enclose a projected mass of @xmath11 , or a mass of @xmath12 within the same 3-d radius . using the simple model of adiabatic compression @xcite",
    ", they estimated that the observed 3-d mass within the einstein radius can be obtained if gas cooling increases the enclosed baryonic fraction within this radius to @xmath13 , twice the cosmic baryon fraction . indeed , hydrodynamic simulations produce clusters that are as centrally concentrated as those observed , likely due to their `` overcooling '' problem which produces just such an increase in the central baryon fraction , with most of it in stars @xcite .",
    "an increase of this sort apparently does not occur in real clusters , where the baryonic ( gas@xmath14stellar ) mass fraction within the einstein radius is below the cosmic value ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , @xcite concluded that cluster halo profiles present perhaps the clearest , most robust , current conflict between observations and the standard @xmath0cdm model .",
    "subsequent work has generally supported this conclusion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though only a large unbiased cluster sample with precise strong and weak lensing measurements would be completely conclusive .    in this paper",
    "we propose a novel process that could resolve the apparent discrepancy between cluster observations and existing @xmath0cdm simulations",
    ". a significant fraction of the final dark matter content of a cluster halo originates within galaxy - sized halos , in which gas can cool and compress the dark matter core to high densities . in ",
    "2 we develop a simple model for this adiabatic compression and for the subsequent tidal stripping of the dark matter within the cluster halo .",
    "we then show in ",
    "3 that the central mass profile of the galaxy cluster is substantially modified by compression of the galactic halos that it swallows , even if the cooled galactic baryons are later redistributed throughout the cluster .",
    "we show quantitatively that this can potentially explain the observed discrepancy .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions and caveats in   4 .",
    "we note that @xcite found in a simulation of a galactic halo that cooling produced a more highly concentrated dark matter profile for the host halo , but there , as in the cluster simulations , this may have been due directly to adiabatic compression in response to the large concentration of baryons in the center of the host halo .",
    "@xcite included radiative cooling and stellar feedback in simulations of cluster formation , and while they focused on the structure of the galactic subhalos , they also found a @xmath15 increase in the effective concentration of the cluster halo ; this , however , may still be partly due to an increased baryon content near the cluster center .",
    "also , @xcite artificially eliminated the over - cooling problem in their cluster simulations and found only a very minor effect of the baryons on the total mass profile in this case ; however , their artificial scheme may have also eliminated the effect we analyze .",
    "our analytical approach allows us to cleanly separate the effect of density - enhanced tidal stripping from a simple overall adiabatic compression of the cluster halo .",
    "we assume the standard @xmath0cdm cosmology @xcite , with a dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath16 and density parameters @xmath17 ( dark matter plus baryons ) , @xmath18 ( cosmological constant ) , and @xmath19 ( baryons ) .",
    "we also denote the cosmic baryon fraction by @xmath20 .",
    "consider a halo that virialized at redshift @xmath21 in a flat @xmath0cdm universe . the critical density at @xmath21 is _",
    "numerical simulations of hierarchical halo formation indicate a roughly universal spherically - averaged density profile for virialized halos ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter nfw ) : ( r)=_c^z  , where the radius @xmath22 is divided by the scale radius @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the virial radius , and the characteristic density @xmath25 is related to the concentration parameter @xmath26 by _",
    "c=  , where @xmath27 is the virial density in units of @xmath28 .",
    "for a halo of virial mass @xmath7 at a given redshift @xmath21 , the profile is fully specified by the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath26 .",
    "we adopt the convention of a fixed @xmath29 at all redshifts , for consistency with the simulation analyses whose results we use .",
    "we adopt a simple analytical model of tidal stripping that , in particular , has been previously used to understand how the density profiles of satellite sub - halos produce the central nfw profile of their final host halo @xcite . in this model , material originally at a radius @xmath30 within the satellite ends up , after tidal stripping , at a radius @xmath22 within the host halo so that the mean enclosed satellite density within @xmath30 equals the mean enclosed host density ( before the stripping ) within @xmath22 :    resonance in dynamical frequencies between the circular orbit of a mass element at @xmath30 around the satellite and that of a circular satellite s orbit around the host halo , inducing an energy transfer that strips the mass element from the satellite . setting the host tidal force equal to the internal gravitational force within the satellite yields a very similar stripping radius .",
    "we combine this stripping model with the simple model of adiabatic compression @xcite in which conservation of angular momentum implies that the quantity @xmath31 ( assuming spherical symmetry ) is fixed .",
    "we assume that both the host and each stripped satellite start out with nfw profiles . in satellites within the mass range of galaxies ,",
    "the baryons cool and condense to the center , inducing a change in the surrounding dark matter halo .",
    "specifically , adiabatic compression moves a mass shell initially at @xmath32 , containing a mass @xmath33 , to a final radius @xmath34 , where the final enclosed mass is larger by a factor = 1-f_b + f_b  , [ eq : mf ] where @xmath35 without an argument denotes the total virial mass of the satellite .",
    "the stripping model then implies that the same mass shell ends up at a radius @xmath36 in the host cluster halo , where    enclosed density @xmath37 in the satellite ( i.e. , before the adiabatic compression ) .",
    "the power of four on the right - hand side results from the increased mass ( one power ) and decreased radius ( hence three powers in the density ) .",
    "note that the cooled baryonic cores of the galaxies are much denser than their surrounding dark matter halos and so we have assumed that the baryonic cores are not tidally stripped .",
    "in deriving equation  ( [ eq : mf ] ) we have assumed that in galactic halos , where the cooling time of the virialized gas is much shorter than the hubble time , the full baryonic content of the halos initially cools toward the center of the halo , condensing the surrounding dark matter before it gets stripped .",
    "observationally , even the fraction of galactic halo baryons that are in stars today is not well known , since the hot baryons in halos are difficult to detect , while total masses of galactic halos are difficult to measure accurately ( and can be used to obtain the total gas mass only with the added assumption of a halo baryon fraction that equals the cosmic mean ) . the best estimate for the total mass of stars and stellar remnants today , as a fraction of the total baryonic mass that lies within virialized regions of galaxies , is @xmath9 , with an uncertainty of order @xmath38 @xcite . for our own milky way galaxy ,",
    "the disk and bulge may make up as much as @xmath39 of the halo baryons @xcite .",
    "regardless of the precise fraction today , it is plausible to assume that most of the gas in galaxies initially cooled and was later expelled over time from the central region back into the halo , through supernova or quasar feedback .",
    "thus , we expect that if galactic halos were stripped within the cluster relatively early , then star formation and feedback did not have much time to operate prior to the stripping .",
    "this scenario does not conflict with the fact that clusters only virialized relatively recently , since we are focusing here on the stripping that formed the inner regions of clusters , within a tenth of the virial radius , and this likely occurred long before the entire cluster virialized .    in clusters",
    ", the originally cooled gas must eventually have gotten dispersed into the intracluster medium , since observations find only a small fraction of cluster baryons residing near the center . in the cluster environment , this gas redistribution can be facilitated by interactions among galaxies or with the intracluster medium , in addition to internal galactic feedback .",
    "for simplicity we assume that the final baryon distribution is similar to that of the dark matter , i.e. , the final baryon fraction is uniform and equal to the cosmic value . within our model above",
    ", this effectively means that the satellites contribute only @xmath40 to the mass enclosed within the final cluster radius @xmath36 ( and not the full @xmath41 ) .    in this picture ,",
    "when the cooled galactic baryons get redistributed throughout the final cluster halo , they may cause a partial adiabatic expansion of the halo .",
    "however , this should roughly cancel the initial adiabatic contraction of the surrounding halo material when the satellites enter and are stripped ; thus , we neglect both the initial halo contraction and the later expansion , as we do not expect a significant net effect .",
    "this is different from the main process that we focus on , where the early adiabatic compression causes the satellites dark matter to be stripped at smaller cluster radii than it would otherwise , leaving a net effect on the cluster in the end .    the stripping model that led to equation  ( [ e : strip ] )",
    "assumes that the host halo is dominant , and that the satellites contribute only a small fraction of the enclosed mass at the stripping radius .",
    "this assumption breaks down , however , when the satellites dominate , and we do expect such a regime ; indeed , it is plausible ( and indicated by pure dark matter simulations ) that the dense core of the cluster halo arises entirely from the original cores of the accreted satellites , since only lower - density material is accreted later onto the cluster halo @xcite . in this high - density regime where the satellites dominate relative to the pre - existing halo material , we expect the satellite cores to simply settle in the host core , preserving in the end their original densities , since they first adiabatically compress and later re - expand . this limit is consistent with the equal - density relation in equation  ( [ e : noac ] ) ; while this equation was originally derived for stripping onto a dominant host halo , we can use it to capture the dominant satellite limit , if we obtain from it the radius @xmath36 at which the satellite mass ended up ( reinterpreted as contributing part of the halo profile rather than adding mass on top of @xmath42 ) .",
    "we leave for future work a detailed analysis of the complex transition region between the two limits of equation  ( [ e : noac ] ) ( density preservation ) and equation  ( [ e : strip ] ) ( density enhancement ) , and here we adopt a simple interpolation between them .",
    "this is reasonable given our limited goal of examining whether the halo profile can be substantially modified at all .",
    "thus , we determine the stripping radius by solving ( for a given @xmath32 ) : |_host^0(r_f ) = |_sat ( _ i ) \\ { f_sat(r_f ) + [ 1-f_sat(r_f ) ] ^4 } , [ e : final ] where @xmath43 is the fractional contribution of the satellites to the enclosed mass within the stripping radius @xmath36 , and the right - hand side of this equation interpolates between equation  ( [ e : noac ] ) ( valid in the limit @xmath44 ) and equation  ( [ e : strip ] ) ( valid when @xmath45 ) .    in order to solve the model",
    ", we must determine various masses .",
    "first , based on the host nfw profile in the absence of cooling and adiabatic compression , we obtain the enclosed host mass at each radius , @xmath46 .",
    "we use equation  ( [ e : noac ] ) to calculate the fractional contribution of the satellites to this enclosed mass in the absence of cooling , @xmath47 .",
    "adiabatic compression and stripping then replaces the satellite contribution by @xmath41 , and thus in equation  ( [ e : final ] ) we set f_sat(r_f ) =  .",
    "[ e : fsat ] after solving for @xmath36 , the final enclosed mass within this radius , after feedback redistributes the baryons , is m_host(r_f ) = [ 1- f_sat^0(r_f ) ] m_host^0(r_f ) + m_sat(_i )  .",
    "[ e : fsatf ]    within our simple model , the redistribution of mass depends only on the density profile of the satellites , i.e. , on the functional form of @xmath48 versus @xmath49 , and not on the number of satellites or their individual total masses .",
    "since we are interested in the galactic sub - halos that end up in the cluster , we can adopt the typical value of accretion redshift @xmath50 and nfw concentration @xmath26 for such halos , and effectively calculate stripping of one satellite that contributes some total fraction @xmath51 of the host cluster mass . within the model",
    ", this single satellite represents the cumulative effect of all the individual galactic satellites that merged into the final cluster halo .    in order to quantify the effect of compressed galactic halos , we must estimate the effective @xmath51 , i.e. , the fraction of cluster dark matter that arrived from within galactic halos in which the baryons were able to cool .",
    "we can obtain a theoretical estimate for the fraction of cluster dark matter that passed in its merger history through galactic halos , on the way to becoming part of the final cluster halo .",
    "for concreteness , let us consider the progenitor distribution at various redshifts of a @xmath52 cluster halo at @xmath53 .",
    "the extended press - schechter model @xcite then implies that @xmath54 of the cluster mass was in halos with masses in the range @xmath55 at @xmath56 ( the redshift that maximizes this fraction ) .",
    "a full merger tree would give on average at least this value since additional cluster mass that was outside this halo mass range at @xmath57 may have passed through galactic halos at other redshifts .",
    "we can also estimate the fraction @xmath51 from observations .",
    "a first attempt might proceed as follows .",
    "stars make up @xmath58 of the total virialized mass of massive clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which correponds to @xmath59 of the total baryonic mass .",
    "to find the baryon fraction that was associated with the galaxies in which these stars formed , we must divide by their average star formation efficiency . as noted above",
    ", the total stellar mass today is @xmath60 of the baryon mass within virialized regions of galaxies @xcite .",
    "this suggests that @xmath61 of the cluster gas was processed through galaxies , and thus also a similar fraction of the cluster s dark matter was contributed by stripped satellite galaxies ( assuming that the total baryon fraction of both these galaxies and the final cluster is equal to the cosmic mean fraction ) .",
    "however , this estimate depends on the uncertain value of the star formation efficiency .",
    "we can use metallicity measurements to obtain a more direct estimate of @xmath51 .",
    "the typical metallicity of the intracluster medium in clusters at redshift @xmath62 is 0.3  0.4 of the solar abundance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while massive galaxies ( in clusters or the field ) typically have a solar abundance or less ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that at least @xmath63 of the cluster gas must have been processed in galaxies in order for the icm to reach its high metallicity value . within our model ,",
    "higher @xmath51 values lead to more highly concentrated cluster halos ( see the next section ) . taking into account these various considerations",
    ", we consider @xmath51 values in the range @xmath64 .",
    "we note that @xcite showed that the classic adiabatic contraction model that we use tends to overestimate the effect of a central baryon concentration on dark matter , compared to simulated profiles .",
    "the overestimate in the mass profile , however , is under @xmath65 at the radii that we focus on ( @xmath66 ) , thus justifying our use of the simple model .",
    "the overestimate does increase at smaller radii and is @xmath61 at @xmath67 , implying that the profiles we find below are less reliable in the innermost region .",
    "in this section we quantify the effect that adiabatic compression in galactic satellites can have on the final density profile of the host cluster halo .",
    "we compare our results to the four clusters considered by @xcite , and also make use of their results for the theoretical predictions . in particular , we adopt the nfw parameters measured by @xcite for simulated halos , after correcting them based on @xcite to obtain the effective parameters for the population of lensing clusters , observed in projection ; however , we reduce @xmath26 by @xmath65 according to the recent results of @xcite .",
    "this yields a median @xmath68 for the most massive clusters , with a 1@xmath8 range ( for the effective projected @xmath26 ) of 47.5 ( approximately in a lognormal distribution ) .",
    "studies based on large numerical simulations @xcite have found for massive halos a relatively weak decline of @xmath26 with increasing redshift , but a more significant decline for galactic mass halos , with @xmath69 for @xmath70@xmath71 halos at @xmath72 . in our quantitative results",
    ", we adopt @xmath73 and @xmath74 for the satellites , and consider hosts at @xmath75 with various concentration parameters .",
    "as noted above , we assume that the dense core of the host arises entirely from the satellite cores , so for each host @xmath26 this normalizes the total satellite fraction @xmath51 of the cluster s virial mass .",
    "in particular , we consider @xmath76 ( which implies a host @xmath77 ) , @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) , or @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "these host concentration parameters are somewhat high but still near or within the expected 1@xmath8 range for cluster halos , as noted above .",
    "figure  [ f : mr ] shows the effect of adiabatic compression on the 3-d mass profiles of clusters .",
    "the effect is largest at the innermost radii , where the satellites contribute a substantial fraction of the halo mass .",
    "this is true even though our model in equation  ( [ e : final ] ) suppresses the density enhancement in this @xmath82 limit ; since the enclosed mass changes rapidly with radius in the core , even a slight shift in the stripping radius has a large effect on the mass profile . for the cases considered , where the fractional mass contribution by satellites @xmath51 is 20 , 30 or @xmath39 , we find that the cluster profile at @xmath83 is substantially modified by adiabatic compression in the satellites , even though the baryonic mass is assumed to have been redistributed uniformly after the stripping",
    ". the enclosed mass at @xmath84 is increased by @xmath85 ( for @xmath76 ) , @xmath86 ( for @xmath78 ) , or @xmath87 ( for @xmath80 ) , and this enhancement factor grows rapidly towards smaller radii .    , and assume satellites with @xmath73 at redshift @xmath74 that make up a total fraction @xmath51 of the cluster s virial mass .",

    "we show the host profile in the absence of cooling and adiabatic compression ( bottom curve ) , and the final profile ( top curve ) of a host that accreted satellites that underwent gas cooling , adiabatic compression and stripping of their dark matter halos before their baryons were redistributed throughout the cluster . in each case",

    "this fraction is between 60 and @xmath92 , which makes our results at this radius ( as seen in figure  [ f : mr ] and below ) relatively insensitive to the precise value of @xmath51 ; higher values of @xmath51 push the satellite fraction higher towards unity , and in this limit stripping can not significantly increase the density of the satellite s dark matter , as reflected in equation  ( [ e : final ] ) .    , and in particular we consider @xmath76 ( short - dashed curves ) , @xmath93 ( solid curves ) , or @xmath39 ( long - dashed curves ) . in each case",
    "we show the satellite fraction in the absence of cooling and adiabatic compression ( @xmath94 , bottom curve ) , the final fraction after stripping and baryon redistribution ( based on equation  ( [ e : fsatf ] ) , middle curve ) , and the higher fraction present during stripping but still before baryon redistribution ( equation  ( [ e : fsat ] ) , top curve).,width=317 ]    the implications of adiabatic compression for gravitational lensing are displayed in figure  [ f : sigr ] , which shows the profile of the enclosed , projected 2-d mass density .",
    "we consider the same cluster and satellite halo parameters as in the previous figures , and focus on the range of projected radius corresponding to observed cluster einstein radii . for each of the observed clusters ,",
    "we show the critical lensing density versus effective einstein radius , as a central point plus 1@xmath8 error ellipse .",

    "still , these predictions in the absence of baryonic cooling for the most part lie well outside the 1@xmath8 error ellipses of the observed clusters .    , and in particular we consider @xmath76 ( short - dashed curves ) , @xmath93 ( solid curves ) , or @xmath39 ( long - dashed curves ) . for comparison , we show the observed values for four clusters , a1689 ( open circle ) , a1703 ( square ) , cl0024 ( triangle ) , and rxj1347 ( @xmath99 ) . for each cluster",

    "for example , if @xmath78 then for a1689 , the observed ( central ) value @xmath100 for the effective einstein radius can be compared with the predicted value ( at the same projected surface density equal to the critical lensing density ) of @xmath101 ( with adiabatic compression in the satellites ) , and the previous pure dark - matter prediction ( i.e. , without adiabatic compression ) of @xmath102 . for a1703 , the observed @xmath103 can be compared with the theoretical @xmath103 ( with adiabatic compression ) and @xmath104 ( without ) . for cl0024 - 17 the corresponding numbers are @xmath105 compared to @xmath106 ( with ) and @xmath101 ( without ) ; for rxj1347 , @xmath107 compared to @xmath105 ( with ) and @xmath108 ( without ) . while the observed clusters still have slightly high einstein radii compared to the typical expected cluster profile , the theoretical scatter in @xmath26 together with the observational errors make the theoretical and observational predictions consistent with each other .",

    "if we assume that only @xmath38 ( rather than @xmath117 ) of the baryons in the galactic satellites cooled and condensed before their halos were stripped , i.e. , in equation  ( [ eq : mf ] ) we use half the cosmic fraction for @xmath118 , then the predicted @xmath96 is reduced by @xmath119 for a1689 and @xmath78 .",
    "we have demonstrated that dark matter compression due to baryonic cooling inside galaxy halos can in turn lead to tidal stripping of these galactic halos closer to the center of the galaxy cluster in which they reside .",
    "even if the baryons are later redistributed within the cluster by feedback , a substantial effect remains due to the early adiabatic compression .",
    "this effect can explain the high central mass concentration of clusters in lensing observations .",

    "<S> the subsequent tidal stripping of this compressed dark matter occurs in denser regions that are closer to the center of the cluster halo . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , the originally cooled gas must be dispersed into the intracluster medium through feedback , for consistency with observations that do not find central baryon enhancements in clusters . </S>",
    "<S> still , the early adiabatic compression of the galactic dark matter leaves a net effect on the cluster . using a simple model for this process , we show that the central cluster profile is substantially modified , potentially explaining the observed discrepancy .    </S>",
