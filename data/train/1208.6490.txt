    "transport processes are of fundamental importance in a wide variety of physical and biological systems , ranging from the actual motion of particles on a lattice @xcite to the transfer of classical and quantum information across spin or harmonic chains @xcite .",
    "relevant for our purposes , there exist specific features of the transport process that are intrinsically linked to the dynamics of the chain and in particular to whether or not the chain elements can interact coherently @xcite . in the mid-@xmath0 s the motion of a charged particle on a one - dimensional lattice under the influence of a time - dependent electric field was studied and shown to exhibit _ dynamic localization _ ( dl ) @xcite .",
    "the canonical situation to illustrate this phenomenon is provided by an infinite linear chain of sites along which a charged particle moves under the combined influence of a nearest - neighbour exchange interaction and a time - dependent external driving . in that setting , it was found that the mean - square displacement of the particle as a function of the field modulation @xmath1 , rather than exhibiting a diffusive behaviour , does not grow without bounds but oscillates sinusoidally .",
    "a related phenomenon is the so called _ coherent destruction of tunneling _ ( cdt ) , initially formulated in dissipationless conditions for a symmetric , externally driven , double - well potential @xcite and subsequently also studied in a dissipative environment @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "both dl and cdt are genuine manifestations of coherent quantum effects resulting from the interference between different transition paths that leads to the selective inhibition of transport @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the classical case , and from an initially localized state , an equilibrium state would be attained in which neighbouring sites would be equally populated . + ample experimental evidence supports the existence of both types of localization effects in a variety of systems .",
    "dl has been observed in rydberg atoms , where the localization regime is characterized by a `` freezing '' of the width of the wave packet with respect to the rydberg levels @xcite ; in driven quantum wells or semiconductor superlattices , where a suppression of the conductance was observed @xcite ; in ultracold atoms interacting with a standing wave of near - resonant light , where this phenomenon was found in the suppression of momentum @xcite .",
    "there exist also experimental proposals to use cdt as a means to control the dynamics of ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite and to create long - distance entanglement between atoms with the possibility to use it in the implementation of quantum logical gates @xcite .",
    "cdt has also been recently observed in both noninteracting @xcite and interacting systems @xcite .",
    "further , motivated by the desire to study the effects of quantum coherence and dephasing noise and the interplay of the two on transport processes in biological systems @xcite , recently the detection of dynamic localization was proposed as a way to demonstrate the possible existence of coherence effects in ion channels @xcite , i.e. protein complexes that regulate the flow of particular ions across the cell membrane and that are essential for a wide variety of cellular functions .    here",
    "we extend this work and discuss the possibility of observing localization effects beyond the canonical setting , including deviations from a strict tight - binding hamiltonian as well as the inclusion of non - hamiltonian ( noisy ) effects .",
    "we will show that signatures of localization effects can still be observed in this case and apply these results to the problem of qualitatively witnessing quantum coherence in an interacting chain of superconducting qubits .",
    "motivated by specific qubit realizations in the solid state , we analyze an array of interacting qubits subject to a hamiltonian of the form ( @xmath2 ) :    @xmath3    with @xmath4 denoting the number of qubits in the chain , @xmath5 the _ site _",
    "energies for each qubit , and @xmath6 the coupling between neighbouring qubits @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the presence of a time - dependent external driving of the form    @xmath9",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath10 of the chain reads    @xmath11    with the substitution @xmath12 , the hamiltonian above can be rewritten as the sum of three contributions ,    @xmath13    with ,    @xmath14    defining the total excitation number operator as @xmath15 it is easy to see that @xmath16=[h_1 , \\hat{n}]=0 $ ] while @xmath17\\ne 0 $ ] .",
    "for this reason , the term @xmath18 is usually referred to as an exchange interaction , in the sense that it allows for a hopping of the excitations within the chain , but it does not create nor annihilate them . this is the canonical interaction in previous studies of dynamical localization in systems that can be modelled with a tight - binding hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "+ in the following lines we will show that the interactions described by the terms @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be indeed enhanced or inhibited separately by the proper tuning of frequency @xmath20 and amplitude @xmath21 of the external field . + to gain insight into the problem , it is convenient to move to an interaction picture with respect the time - dependent term @xmath22 .",
    "that is , we first define    @xmath23    where we have made use that @xmath22 commutes with itself at different times to write the last equality above .",
    "computing explicitly the integral above and taking into account that the operators acting on different sites commute , we have that @xmath24 + hence , the interaction picture hamiltonian of our chain can be written as @xmath25 where we have defined @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "now , making use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : u0 ] ) and the jacobi - anger expansion @xmath28 , where @xmath29 are the bessel functions of first kind , we can proceed further and evaluate the form of these terms explicitly as :    @xmath30    @xmath31    for the sake of clarity we will consider in the following the case of a homogeneous chain with @xmath32 and @xmath33 for all values of @xmath7 . under this assumption",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath34 can be written as : @xmath35 with time - dependent renormalized couplings @xmath36 and @xmath37 defined as    @xmath38    @xmath39    in the regime where the tunneling frequency of the qubits is much smaller than the frequency of the driving field , that is @xmath40 , we can invoke the rotating wave approximation in the series above and neglect those terms that rotate faster than @xmath41 . in particular , for @xmath36",
    "this means that only the non - rotating term with @xmath42 survives and we can write    @xmath43    applying the same reasoning to @xmath37 it follows that the only possibility to have surviving terms is that a resonance between @xmath44 and @xmath20 ocurrs such that @xmath45 for some integer value @xmath46 . in this case , eq.([eq : gprime_b ] ) can be further simplified , yielding    @xmath47    we therefore see that the effect of the external modulation can be interpreted as renormalization of the coupling constants , imprinting a periodic dependence that will lead to a selective inhibition of transport . in the following sections we will provide numerical evidence of the accuracy of the expressions derived above .",
    "this type of localization effect will be later exploited to detect signatures of coherent interaction in arrays of coupled qubits .",
    "we will study the persistence of population localization effects induced by the renormalization of the hopping coupling , as explained in the previous section , in the dynamics of superconducting qubit arrays .",
    "superconducting qubits are effective two - level systems with a controllable transition frequency between their eigenstates , whose potential to be manufactured lithographically in a controlled manner and in a variety of geometries makes them a promising candidate for the implementation of quantum registers and information processers @xcite . on the other hand , while the fabrication of structures involving many qubits is indeed feasible @xcite , its effective probing , and in particular the verification that the system does exhibit quantum coherence , is beyond the realm of current technology even for moderate system size .",
    "the current state of the art is provided by the tomographic analysis and the entanglement verification of 3 qubit systems @xcite .        in general",
    "the superconducting qubit hamiltonian can be written as @xmath48 .",
    "depending on the particular qubit realization the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 refer to different variables defining `` charge '' , `` phase '' or `` flux '' qubits .",
    "the latter , also called `` persistent current qubit '' , consists of a superconducting loop interrupted by three josephson junctions , two with capacitance @xmath51 and the third with @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the values of the three josephson junctions coupling constants , @xmath53 corresponding to capacitance @xmath51 and @xmath54 to capacitance @xmath52 respectively , are chosen so that the josephson part of the hamiltonian alone defines a bistable system . at a value of external magnetic flux",
    "@xmath55 ( @xmath56 is the superconducting flux quantum ) , the system carries either a clockwise or counterclockwise persistent current , each generating an equal but opposite magnetic flux and defining the two possible states of this qubit . with an appropriate choice of the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the barrier in phase space separating the left and right current states can be made low enough so that tunneling between the two classical states can occur .",
    "for the flux qubits @xmath50 represents the tunneling amplitude , while the energy bias @xmath59 is proportional to the detuning @xmath60 , with @xmath61 the circulating current .",
    "the energies of the ground and first excited states are thus : @xmath62 .    for flux qubits ,",
    "the most natural implementation for the interaction is through the mutual inductances between the loops .",
    "the flux generated by one qubit loop , which depends on its internal state , adds to the total flux picked up by the neighbouring qubits , thereby changing the energy biases of those qubits .",
    "the mutual inductance , and therefore the strength of the interaction ( @xmath41 ) , depends on the geometry of the qubit loops , specifically their size and their proximity to each other .",
    "the strength of the coupling can be enhanced in two steps .",
    "first by physically connecting the loops so that their persistent currents share a common line . in this case",
    "the kinetic inductance of the shared line adds to the geometrical inductance , where the former term can easily be the dominating part in the total interaction strength . to reach very strong coupling , for example to reach the regime @xmath63 , a fourth junction",
    "can be placed in the shared line .",
    "if the capacitance and josephson junction coupling constant of this fourth junction are large compared to parameters of the qubit junctions , the single - qubit properties are not significantly altered , while still the interaction strength can be enhanced dramatically .",
    "coupling strengths of several ghz are easily achieved . for the sake of the suggested experiments in this paper",
    "it is however not necessary to reach such high coupling values since the hopping inhibition between the qubits is enhanced in the regime where the hopping constant is smaller than the driving frequency , i.e. @xmath40 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gprime_a ] , [ eq : gprime_b ] ) and explanations below those expressions ) .    in the experiment described in reference @xcite ,",
    "it is demonstrated how the standard flux qubit design , for which only @xmath49 is a tunable parameter , can be extended to also have a tunable @xmath50 .",
    "the main change is that the smallest junction of the qubit is replaced by a small loop containing one junction in each arm , i.e. in a squid ( superconducting quantum interference device ) geometry .",
    "the squid acts as a single junctions with tunable @xmath64 , tuned by the flux penetrating the small loop .",
    "local control lines can be used to change the flux through this loop , thereby controlling the @xmath54 of the qubit , and thus the @xmath50 .",
    "[ fig : schemepic ] shows a schematic of a possible implementation of a chain of strongly interacting flux qubits with tunable tunneling splitting @xmath50 .",
    "when the array of interacting superconducting flux qubits is operated at their corresponding degeneracy point the chain is described by a hamiltonian of the form eq.([h ] ) , with @xmath65 .",
    "typical values for the tunneling amplitudes are in the range of 5 - 20 ghz while nearest neighbour couplings @xmath66 mhz .",
    "the residual next - to - nearest coupling is smaller than 10 mhz .",
    "as far as the coupling to the environment is concerned , typically , noise sources that are located relatively far away from the chain couple to multiple or all qubits in the chain , for example magnetic coils , or some parts of the control and readout circuits .",
    "noise sources that are located much closer , such as local control lines for the individual qubits , or microscopic noise sources in the materials surrounding the qubits , couple only , or mostly , to a single qubit . in this work",
    "we focus on the latter type : we suppose the array to be in contact with an external environment that acts locally on each qubit and can lead in principle to both pure dephasing and dissipation . in our model",
    "each qubit is coupled to its local environment via a spin - boson hamiltonian of the form    @xmath67    where the bath is modelled as a collection of harmonic oscillators , @xmath68 and system and bath couple linearly through the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath69 here @xmath70 denotes the bath s _ force _ operator . in the qubit eigenbasis and using the same symbols to denote the pauli matrices in this new frame in order not to complicate notation , we can derive , using the standard assumptions , a markovian master equation @xmath71 + l_{\\rm deph}(\\varrho ) + l_{\\rm diss}(\\varrho)$ ] for the qubit array where the coupling to the local environment is described in terms of lindblad terms of the form @xcite @xmath72 @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 denoting the dephasing and dissipation rate , respectively , @xmath76 acting on the @xmath77-th qubit of the chain and @xmath78 the anticommutation operation .",
    "the value of the noise rates in these expressions depends strongly on the selected qubit operating point via the parameter @xmath79 . measured values for @xmath80 range from 150 to 500 ns while pure dephasing times @xmath81 are typically around 300 ns . in the specific case where each qubit in the chain is operated at the degeneracy point , so that @xmath82 for every qubit , the pure dephasing term , which has a rate @xmath83 @xcite , cancels out and the chain is subject to dissipative noise only .",
    "this is the first parameter regime that we are going to analyze in the next section with the aim of unveiling coherent dynamics through dynamical localization effects in a driven chain .",
    "later , still operating each qubit at its degeneracy point , we will relax the constraint of having only dissipation noise and we will consider possible dephasing effects arising from terms with the form of eq .",

    "<S> we discuss how the observation of population localization effects in periodically driven systems can be used to quantify the presence of quantum coherence in interacting qubit arrays . </S>",
    "<S> essential for our proposal is the fact that these localization effects persist beyond tight - binding hamiltonian models . </S>",
    "<S> this result is of special practical relevance in those situations where direct system probing using tomographic schemes becomes infeasible beyond a very small number of qubits . as a proof of principle , </S>",
    "<S> we study analytically a hamiltonian system consisting of a chain of superconducting flux qubits under the effect of a periodic driving . </S>",
    "<S> we provide extensive numerical support of our results in the simple case of a two - qubits chain . for this system </S>",
    "<S> we also study the robustness of the scheme against different types of noise and disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we show that localization effects underpinned by quantum coherent interactions should be observable within realistic parameter regimes in chains with a larger number of qubits . </S>"
