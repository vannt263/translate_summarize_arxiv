    ". remarkably , tanaskovi _ et al .",
    "_ found that very strong site disorder screening emerges precisely in the vicinity of the mott metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "this effect can be traced back to the pinning of the single - impurity kondo resonances to the fermi level , which acts to suppress the effective randomness .",
    "motivated by this striking result , we extended their work to finite dimensions__. _ _ to treat both strong correlations and disorder in a non - perturbative fashion at @xmath0 , we use a generalization of the dmft , the statistical dmft ( _ _ statdmft _ _ ) @xcite , implemented using a slave boson impurity solver @xcite .",
    "this approach is equivalent to the description of the effects of disorder through a gutzwiller - type wave function @xcite , which in the clean case realizes the brinkman - rice scenario of the mott transition @xcite .",
    "the statdmft method retains the local treatment of electronic correlations .",
    "however , in contrast to the infinite - dimensional dmft approach , here each strongly correlated site sees a _ different bath of electrons _ , reflecting the strong spatial fluctuations of their immediate environment .",
    "we find that , concomitant to a strong pinning effect , additional effective disorder is also generated through an increasingly broader distribution of quasiparticle weights .",
    "their interplay leads to a non - trivial landscape in energy space : the proximity to the mott transition acts to suppress density of states fluctuations close to the fermi level , while at the same time _ enhancing _ them at higher energies .",
    "we focus on the disordered hubbard model @xmath1 where @xmath2@xmath3 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin projection @xmath4 on site @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude , @xmath7 is the on - site hubbard repulsion , @xmath8 is the number operator , and the site energies @xmath9 are uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath10 $ ] , where @xmath11 is the disorder strength .",

    "this theory is exact in the non - interacting limit and reduces to the standard dmft in the absence of disorder . unlike the dmft",

    "we start by writing an effective action ( in imaginary time ) for a given site @xmath5 , with the simplification that we neglect all non - quadratic terms in the local fermionic operators except for the local @xmath7-term@xmath16 the site @xmath5 is connected with the rest of the lattice through the bath ( or `` cavity '' ) function @xmath17 , which in statdmft ( but in contrast to dmft ) varies from site to site and thus exhibits strong spatial fluctuations .    the effective action in eq .",

    ", the stability of a @xmath51 metal with respect to weak - localization corrections has been investigated by punnoose and finkelstein @xcite in very careful recent work .",
    "these authors have demonstrated that any @xmath51 metal remains stable with respect to sufficiently weak disorder due to additional ( anti - localizing ) interaction corrections .",
    "note , however , that both the weak - localization and the corresponding interaction corrections are manifested only through a very weak , logarithmic dependence on the system size .",
    "such subtle finite size effects are not visible for the very weak ( renormalized ) disorder we deal with in this work .",
    "nevertheless , based on the very convincing considerations of punnoose and finkelstein , the stability of a @xmath51 metal is beyond immediate doubt and these issues are not of relevance for the questions we focus on in this paper .",

    "this quantity vanishes linearly at a critical value of interaction @xmath53 at which the mott transition takes place , marking the transmutation of most itinerant electrons into local magnetic moments ( see the inset of fig .",

    ", @xmath54 is an increasing function of the disorder strength @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we also stress that the average value of the quasiparticle weight @xmath48 is small yet finite at the mott transition ( inset of fig .",

    "using the fact that in the current statdmft approach the lattice problem is mapped onto an _ ensemble _ of auxiliary anderson impurity problems , we can characterize the approach to the mott transition by a steady decrease of the local kondo temperature @xmath59 @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , the renormalized disorder potential @xmath39 can be thought of as the position of the local kondo resonance energy .    in the dmft limit @xmath61 , each site has many neighbors and thus is embedded in the same ( self - averaged ) environment described by @xmath62 . in this regime ,",
    "as long as @xmath62 is particle - hole symmetric , we find _ perfect _ disorder screening close to the mott transition @xcite .",
    "this happens because , as we increase @xmath7 towards @xmath63 , we approach the kondo limit , @xmath64 , causing @xmath39 ( the kondo resonance ) to be `` pinned '' to the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "however , within the _ _ statdmft _ _ approach , @xmath57 fluctuates strongly from site to site and is not locally particle - hole symmetric ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hibfxw ] ) . for this reason ,",
    "we expect that @xmath39 will also have a contribution which is proportional to @xmath65 $ ] . therefore , we have no guarantee that a similar mechanism of disorder screening will persist close to the critical point in @xmath51 .",
    "surprisingly , however , for small and moderate disorder @xmath66 , we do get a very strong disorder screening close to the mott metal - insulator transition ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : screening ] and [ fig : p(v ) ] ) .",
    "probability distribution function @xmath44 of the renormalized site energy @xmath45 .",
    "as we move towards the mott transition , disorder screening takes place and @xmath44 becomes increasingly narrower .",

    "the color scale is logarithmic in order to stress that , as we approach the critical point , we have the formation of regions in which @xmath71 ( localized magnetic moments ) and @xmath72 ( anderson insulator droplets ) .",
    "results are shown for @xmath50 and @xmath41 . ]",
    "the site - to - site fluctuations in the hybridization function encode _ spatial correlations _ between the physical quantities , implying , for example , that the value of the local quasi - particle weight at a given site depends on the quasi - particle weight values at the neighboring sites . therefore , due to rare disorder configurations , it is possible to find regions containing sites in which @xmath73 ( red regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : zz_spatial ] ) .",
    "since the approach to the mott insulator corresponds to @xmath74 , such regions with @xmath75 should be recognized as `` almost localized '' mott droplets ( consisting of localized magnetic moments @xcite ) inside the strongly correlated metallic host . within our brinkman - rice picture",

    "the mott droplets have a direct influence on the probability distribution function @xmath77 , since they give rise to a low-@xmath78 tail , contributing to the fact that @xmath77 actually broadens as we approach the mott metal - insulator transition for a _ fixed _",
    "@xmath11 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : zz_spatial ] and [ fig : p(z_typ ) ] .    surely , there is also a contribution to the broadening of @xmath77 coming from the high-@xmath78 tail originating from those sites with @xmath79 .",
    "such sites retain a finite @xmath38 at the transition and are nearly empty or doubly occupied , giving rise to anderson insulating regions ( blue regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : zz_spatial ] ) .",
    "the coexistence of localized magnetic moments , and nearly empty or doubly occupied sites close to the critical point is characteristic of a two - fluid behavior @xcite . nevertheless , this interesting phenomenon is not relevant for the present analysis , since the major contribution to the energy resolved inhomogeneities , discussed in the next section , as well as to the thermodynamic response , comes from the mott droplets .",

    ", @xmath77 becomes increasingly broader , even though the bare disorder strength @xmath11 is kept fixed .",
    "results are shown for @xmath46 . ]",
    "from the above discussion , it is clear that the behaviors of @xmath44 and @xmath77 near the mott metal - insulator transition are quite distinct . while the former exhibits strong disorder screening ( fig .",
    "[ fig : p(v ) ] ) , the latter suggests that the disorder is actually increasing ( fig .",
    "[ fig : p(z_typ ) ] ) .",
    "this dichotomy gives rise to an _ energy - dependent effective disorder _",
    ", which manifests itself , for example , in the spatial structure of the local density of states .",

    "therefore , the frequency - dependent effective disorder potential `` seen '' by the quasiparticles at energy @xmath86 can be defined as @xmath87    spatial distribution of the local density of states normalized by its clean and non - interacting value for one given realization of disorder and two distinct values of interaction : _ ( a ) _ @xmath88 and _ ( b ) _",
    "@xmath89 , where @xmath90 .",
    "we have @xmath91 in the bottom figures and @xmath92 in the top ones . at the fermi energy ,",
    "the local density of states distribution becomes homogeneous as we approach the mott transition .",
    "conversely , if we move even slightly away from the fermi energy , the distribution becomes in fact more inhomogeneous close to @xmath49 .",
    "results are shown for @xmath41 , @xmath50 . ]    in our brinkman - rice scenario of the mott transition , the quasi - particle bandwidth is reduced by @xmath47 as @xmath93 . to monitor the behavior within the quasi - particle band ,",
    "we therefore introduce a rescaled frequency @xmath94 , which we will keep constant as we approach the transition . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos_spatial ] , we show topographic maps of the local density of states for one specific realization of disorder . because of strong disorder screening , @xmath95 close to the critical point .",
    "thus , if the system is examined at the fermi energy ( @xmath91 ) , it becomes more and more homogeneous as the transition is approached . at higher energies ( @xmath96 ) , however , the fluctuations in @xmath97 come into play .",
    "since they are very pronounced close to the mott transition , we instead find a strong enhancement of the spatial inhomogeneity .",
    "this result is surprisingly reminiscent of recent spectroscopic images on doped cuprates @xcite .",
    "our theory , which focuses on local ( kondo - like ) effects of strong correlations ( while neglecting inter - site magnetic correlations ) and does not include any physics associated with superconducting pairing , strongly suggests that such energy - resolved inhomogeneity is a robust and general feature of disordered mott systems .",
    "indeed , recent results corroborate this picture of an energy - resolved strong - correlation driven disorder screening @xcite .",
    "we have discussed the results of a brinkman - rice approach to the disordered mott transition .",
    "a striking feature that is apparent in this scenario is the different behaviors of the effective site disorder and the quasiparticle weights as the transition is approached .",
    "whereas randomness in the former is suppressed , the latter becomes extremely singular and broad on the way to the mott insulator .",
    "the end result of this dichotomy is a non - trivial energy - space landscape , which is signaled by an energy - dependent inhomogeneity .",
