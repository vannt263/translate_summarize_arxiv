    "high critical temperature superconductors ( htsc ) have been discovered fifteen years ago  @xcite , but many of their properties remains not well explained .",
    "some of their features are completely different from the low temperature superconductors , for example , the @xmath4-@xmath5 phase diagram of the htsc possess , in certain cases , positive curvature for @xmath6 , with no evidence of saturation at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "these lack of saturation at low temperatures may minimize the importance of strong fluctuations of the order parameter which was one of the earlier leading ideas  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this behavior can not be explained by the classical whh ( werthamer - helfand - hohenberg ) theory for superconductors  @xcite where @xmath6 exhibits negative curvature and saturates at low temperatures .    in order to interpret this unusual behavior and",
    "furnishes ground to the @xmath0 positive curvature many different possibilities were proposed like , for instance : the interplay between anderson localization and superconductivity which affects the coherent length near the mobility edge  @xcite , the effect of correlations among magnetic impurities which leads to a weakening of the pair breaking process  @xcite , mesoscopic fluctuations  @xcite , depletion of vortex viscosity or local pairs confined to small superconducting regions coupled through a normal host due to anisotropic quasiparticle relaxation rate around the fermi surface  @xcite , effective two component ( boson - fermion ) model  @xcite , luttinger liquid behavior in the normal state  @xcite , bipolaron superconductivity  @xcite , charge - density waves and stripes  @xcite .    on the other hand , another feature that has recently received considerable attention is the intrinsic inhomogeneous distribution of charge ( or doping level ) and superconducting gaps , as demonstrated by the stm / s experiments  @xcite . based on these measurements and in a number of others , like neutron diffraction  @xcite",
    ", we have proposed a general theory to explain the main features of the htsc phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "the main point is that near the pseudogap temperature @xmath7  @xcite some localized regions become superconducting , and the size of these regions increases as the temperature is lowered and , at the critical temperature @xmath2 , these superconducting regions percolate , and the system becomes able to hold a dissipationless current .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the meissner effect above @xmath2 measured by iguchi et al .",
    "@xcite and the diamagnetic signal above @xmath2 which has also been measured by other groups by susceptibility  @xcite .",
    "the drift of magnetic vortices expected to occur in the a superconductor phase has also been measured in htsc at temperatures above @xmath2 through the nernst effect  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we develop a unified view for all these anomalous properties to explain the observed features of the upper critical field @xmath0 unusual properties in htsc . in our approach",
    "the pseudogap temperature @xmath7 is where small static superconducting regions starts to develop  @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic inhomogeneities in the charge produces superconducting gaps which varies locally inside a given sample and , as the temperature decreases below @xmath7 , the superconducting regions start to grow as it has been demonstrated by the meissner effect measurements  @xcite . at temperatures below @xmath7 , but above the critical temperature @xmath2 , there is no long range order but there are several isolated local superconducting regions inside the sample .",
    "this scenario explains why there is some indications that @xmath0 does not vanish at @xmath2  @xcite but at a much larger value ; also a much larger magnetization than the expected , above @xmath2 , has been recently measured  @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty to perform calculations in this scenario is the lack of information on the inhomogeneous distribution of charge in a given sample .",
    "based on the experimental results which led to the idea of stripes  @xcite and on the stm / s results , we have proposed a bimodal distribution for the charge inside a given htsc  @xcite .",
    "although we do not know the exact form of such distribution , it mimics the antiferromagnetic ( af ) insulator regions ( insulator branch ) and the metallic regions ( metallic branch ) and it contains several features found in the cuprates",
    ". here we will apply such distribution derived in ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate the contribution of resulting superconducting regions to estimate the magnetic response for some materials and compare with the experimental results .",
    "this is accomplished through a simple model to compute the contribution of the superconducting regions to the upper critical field @xmath0 , considering that each of these regions acts as independent superconducting regions whose @xmath0 is described by the gl equation .",
    "all the contributions from different regions are computed to give the total upper critical field of a given superconducting compound .",
    "this is a clear phenomenological approach that , according to the gl theory , yield good results near the critical temperatures .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that ref .",
    "@xcite has also inferred that the positive curvature of @xmath0 could be due to pair formation in small grains with local @xmath2 higher than the bulk @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , we can see that several attempts had been published  @xcite connecting @xmath0 and its features with the effects of some type of disorder . by the same token",
    ", we apply below our recently developed theory  @xcite on the inhomogeneities of cuprates and pseudogap phenomenon to evaluate a theory for the @xmath0 of these materials .",
    "this paper is divided as follows : in sec.ii we present the density of charge distribution and the phase diagram of a selected compound of the lsco family . in sec.iii",
    "the upper critical field @xmath0 from the gl theory is considered and generalized with the inclusion of the inhomogeneous superconducting regions .",
    "in sec.iv we compare the theoretical results with some selected experimental data of the lsco family and optimum bi2212 high-@xmath2 . a good qualitative agreement is observed . in sec.v",
    "we make the final analyses and conclusions .",
    "just for completeness , we will briefly outline the basic ideas concerned with the inhomogeneous charge distribution introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to model this inhomogeneous medium we consider a phenomenological distribution of probability @xmath8 of a given local charge density @xmath1 .",
    "the differences in the local charge densities yield insulator and metallic regions . for simplicity",
    "we hereafter make @xmath1=@xmath9 .",
    "the distribution @xmath8 we consider is a combination of a gaussian and a poisson distribution , which becomes the appropriate distribution to deal with the high and low density compounds  @xcite , that is , the whole phase diagram .",
    "the main features of @xmath10 is that it has two branches : an insulating one with @xmath11 , and a metallic one which starts at @xmath12 .     for the lsco @xmath13=0.15 compound",
    "the arrows indicates the density @xmath14=0.05 , the percolation density @xmath15=0.225 , and @xmath12 , with @xmath12=@xmath13 .",
    "the hachured part indicates the region below the percolation threshold @xmath15 , i.e. the region below the superconducting critical temperature @xmath2 .",
    "b ) the theoretical local superconducting critical temperatures @xmath16 for this compound is shown as the solid line , together with the experimental pseudogap temperatures @xmath7 of refs .",
    "the filled black circles are the experimental critical temperatures @xmath2 of the lsco family from ref .",
    "the vertical and horizontal lines indicates @xmath17=@xmath2.,height=264 ]    for most compounds @xmath12@xmath18@xmath19 , where @xmath19 is the average density of a compound . in fig .",
    "[ fighc21 ] we show the phase diagram for the lsco @xmath19=0.15 compound together with the charge distribution and experimental data of ref .  @xcite .",
    "since the local critical temperature @xmath16 is a decreasing function of @xmath9 , the maximum @xmath2 is @xmath20 , which is therefore the system pseudogap temperature @xmath7 . upon cooling below @xmath7 part of the metallic regions",
    "become superconducting . at @xmath5=@xmath2 @xmath21 of the material",
    "is in the superconducting phase and we say that the superconducting regions percolate  @xcite .    in order to study the effect of the charge distribution on our results we have considered a constant and a linear decreasing distribution , with metallic and insulating branches , evaluated with the densities @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( see fig.[fighc21 ] ) for @xmath12=0.15 , and in the same range .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig2]a of section iv and indicate that the qualitative behavior remains the same , i.e. , the inhomogeneities seem to be the cause of the positive curvature , but the quantitative agreement is worst than the results from the distribution derived by the stm experiments and used in our calculations .",
    "it is well known that most of the htsc are type - ii superconductors  @xcite . for these type of superconductors",
    "there are two critical fields in the @xmath4-@xmath5 phase diagram : the lower @xmath22 and the upper @xmath0 . above @xmath0",
    "the material returns to the normal metal state . by definition ,",
    "one expects the superconductivity to disappear above the upper critical field @xmath0 .    in the case of an external magnetic field parallel to the @xmath23-direction ,",
    "i.e. perpendicular to the @xmath24 planes ( @xmath25-direction ) , the gl upper critical field is given by  @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the flux quantum and @xmath28 is the gl temperature dependent coherence length in the @xmath25 plane  @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 is determined by the coherence length @xmath28 of the supercondutor , which is treated as a phenomenological parameter . in terms of the gl parameters",
    "the coherence length is given @xmath29 where @xmath30=@xmath31 is the extrapolated coherence length , @xmath32 is the part of the mass tensor for the @xmath25 plane and @xmath33 is a constant  @xcite . using the bcs formula",
    "@xmath34 we expect a shorter coherence length for htsc relative to the low temperature supercondutors due to their 10 times higher @xmath2 s . however , due to the lower density of carriers  @xcite , @xmath35 in these materials is also small , which results in very short coherence length , @xmath36 .",
    "a typical value for the extrapolated coherence length which we use in our calculations is @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the ybco  @xcite and @xmath39 and @xmath40 for lsco  @xcite , where @xmath41 is the coherence length in the @xmath23 direction .",
    "one should note that @xmath41 is smaller than @xmath42 and is of the order of the spacing between adjacent conducting @xmath24 planes .",
    "therefore , the gl upper critical field may be written as @xmath43    let us now apply this expression to a htsc with intrinsic inhomogeneities in the charge distribution .",
    "when considering the inhomogeneity of the htsc at temperatures below @xmath7 , isolated superconducting regions may exist in the form of separated islands even in magnetic fields @xmath44  @xcite . for temperatures above @xmath2",
    "there is no long range order but , due to the various different local values of @xmath3 superconducting regions may exist in the form of separated regions . here",
    "we calculate the upper critical field @xmath0 for a given sample assuming that each isolated or connected superconducting region displays a local @xmath45 which is given by the linearized gl equation with effective mass tensor  @xcite . since a given local superconducting region `` @xmath46 '' has a local temperature @xmath47 with a probability @xmath48 and local coherence length @xmath49 , it will contribute to the upper critical field with a local linear upper critical field @xmath50 near @xmath47 . therefore , the total contribution of the local superconducting regions to the upper critical field is the sum of all the @xmath50 s .",
    "thus , applying eq.([3 ] ) , the @xmath0 for an entire sample is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the number of superconducting regions , or superconducting islands each with its local @xmath47@xmath53 and @xmath54 is the sum of all the @xmath48 s . as we have already mentioned , at temperatures above @xmath2 there are isolated superconducting regions , while below @xmath2 these regions percolate and the system may hold a dissipationless current . since @xmath0 is experimentally measured at @xmath55(@xmath4=0 ) , it is the field which destroys the superconducting clusters with @xmath56 , leading the system without percolation .",
    "the first regions which are broken are the weakest ones , which have critical temperatures @xmath47 s lower than @xmath2(@xmath4=0 ) .",
    "the mechanism is the following : at a temperature @xmath55 most of the system is superconducting and a small applied field destroys first the superconducting regions at lower @xmath47 s , without loss of long range order .",
    "increasing the applied field causes more regions to become normal and eventually when the regions with @xmath57 turn to the normal phase , the system is about to have a nonvanishing resistivity .",
    "this value of the applied field is taken as the @xmath0 in our theory , and it is the physical meaning of eq.([4 ] ) .",
    "thus , at a given temperature @xmath5 , we sum the superconducting regions with @xmath56 , with their respective probabilities .",
    "it is important to notice that the stm experiments have demonstrated that the size of a region with constant superconducting gap is of the order of @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "these results have also been obtained by @xmath59sr experiments  @xcite . according to the discussion in the introduction , at @xmath7",
    "some small superconducting isolated islands ( or droplets ) start to appear through the system .",
    "therefore , near @xmath7 the gl approach should not be valid because the size of an island coherence lenght with @xmath47@xmath18@xmath7 is of the same order of the superconducting islands .",
    "as the temperature decreases the superconducting islands start to unite forming larger inhomogeneous superconducting regions . at @xmath2",
    "they percolate , occupying 60@xmath60 of the system . at @xmath55",
    "the occupied superconducting volume is comparable to the size of the system and clearly much larger than the typical coherence length @xmath49 of the different inhomogeneous regions .",
    "consequently , we may use the gl theory to calculate the upper critical field of these different superconducting regions which form the whole condensate , and the total sample @xmath0 is the sum of these individual inhomogeneous contributions as in eq.([4 ] ) .",

    "the dashed line is a gl fitting.,height=245 ]    the experimental upper critical field @xmath0 of the htsc may be obtained from the resistivity measurements as it is the field relative to a fraction of the `` normal - state '' resistivity  @xcite .",

    "furthermore , it is reasonable to take @xmath2 from the @xmath4-@xmath5 phase diagram as the temperatures where @xmath63=0 .",
    "however , it is experimentally observed  @xcite that for some compounds @xmath63 vanishes at temperatures much smaller than the known values of @xmath2 .",
    "this is because the superconducting transition is sharp at low fields , but spreads itself over a large interval of temperatures as the field increases . as a consequence one defines the field",
    "@xmath64 , @xmath65 being a percentage of the normal state resistivity . in some cases the difference between @xmath63 and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 of the normal - sate resistivity ) may be about @xmath68 of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "when this is the case the correct @xmath0 may be between these two fields . in our calculations from eq([4 ] ) @xmath0 is calculated for @xmath69 and always vanishes at @xmath2 , with @xmath0 being in principle the @xmath63 field . by the same token , for the nernst signal measurements of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath62 may be considered the upper critical field since it represents an intrinsic field which controls the onset of the flux - flow dissipation and vanishes at a temperature close to @xmath2 .",

    "[ fig2]c ) we compared our results with @xmath66 since this field vanishes at @xmath71 , which is the value of @xmath2 obtained from the phase diagram of ref  @xcite , while @xmath63 vanishes at @xmath72 . in fig .",

    "similarly one gets @xmath77=45 t .",
    "these discrepancies for the low temperature values of @xmath6 is clearly due to the gl expressions ( eqs.([1])-([4 ] ) ) , which should not be used far from @xmath2 .",
    "this is the reason why we stop our calculations at temperatures below @xmath2/3 . at very low temperatures",
    "we do not know how to estimate the contributions of the islands with @xmath47@xmath18@xmath2 .",
    "we have calculated the upper critical field @xmath6 for a disordered superconductor characterized by a distribution of different local critical temperatures @xmath47 at different domains .",
    "we have applied a simple gl expression to each of these superconducting regions . with this procedure",
    "we can explain the magnetic signals below and above @xmath2 .",
    "we have been able to fit the @xmath0 curves derived by two different experimental procedures , namely the resistive magnetic fields and the nernst signal  @xcite . in all the cases the curves exhibit a positive curvature which is different from the magnetically determined @xmath0 lines  @xcite from pure gl ( eq.([3 ] ) ) .",
    "this positive curvature reflects the gl behavior of each individual domain in a disordered superconductor .",
    "furthermore , taking the inhomogenous charge distribution into account several properties like the meissner and nernst effects , which are seen at temperatures much higher than @xmath2 , are naturally explained .",
    "such inhomogeneities are taken into account by a charge distribution , but as discussed above , the main features of our calculations are independent of the details of the probability charge distribution . in conclusion",
