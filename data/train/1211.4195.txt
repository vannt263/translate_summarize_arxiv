    "the dynamics of the transient electromagnetic field driven by relativistic electronic surface currents , which are generated by the interaction of ultra - intense laser beams with solids @xcite , are of relevance to important applications such as laser - driven ion acceleration @xcite and fast ignition @xcite .",
    "the surface magnetic and electrostatic fields can be of the order of @xmath0 t and @xmath1v / m @xcite , respectively , during the ultra - intense ( @xmath2w/@xmath3 ) laser - solid interaction , and such fields can last several tens of picoseconds after the laser pulse ends .",
    "charging of a laser - irradiated target , which is attributed to the escape of hot electrons generated during the laser - plasma interaction , has been detected in several experiments @xcite using proton probing techniques . because of their confinement by the sheath electric field and surface magnetic field , most of the hot electrons are bound to the target surface @xcite as they move away from the interaction region .",
    "the surface current is closed by the return current within the target and this current loop encloses a strong magnetic field .",
    "this magnetic field generation mechanism is known as the fountain effect .",
    "recent experiments @xcite have demonstrated that , during the ultra - intense laser irradiating the target , the magnetic field tied to the electron current expands along the solid s surface at a speed close to that of light .    if two ultra - intense laser pulses of comparable intensity irradiate the target s surface at two separate points simultaneously , they produce two relativistic electron flows at the rear surface . both flows",
    "collide head - on half - way between the two interaction points at the planar rear surface .",
    "the superposition of their respective currents , which are oppositely directed and comparable in magnitude , initially results in a net current density , which is low compared to the current density of each electron beam .",
    "this reduction of the current density results in a weakened magnetic field in the beam overlap region .",
    "the time - evolution of the counter - streaming beams and of the electric and magnetic fields , which result in their thermalization , depends on the nature of the instabilities and processes that are involved .",
    "previous related experiments have examined the simultaneous interaction of two or more laser pulses with a solid target .",
    "the laser pulses had intensities of @xmath4w/@xmath5 @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "the expansion of plasma bubbles at the front surface of the target was examined with the aim to study magnetic reconnection of the megagauss - fields , which encircle the individual plasmas and confine them .",
    "the moderate laser intensity has limited the particle flow speeds to the nonrelativistic regime .",
    "such flows tend to thermalize electrostatically .    here",
    "the speeds of the electron sheaths , which form before ion jets are launched , are relativistic and the magnetic fields sustained by their currents are confined to a narrow layer close to the surface .",
    "the instabilities that result in the thermalisation of the relativistic fast electron flows differ from the nonrelativistic ones in ref .",
    "@xcite that involve electrons and ions .",
    "the counter - streaming relativistic electrons give rise to a wide range of beam instabilities in this overlap layer .",
    "the potentially large number of instabilities can be reduced to three , if we assume that only the electrons interact , that the thermal spread of the electron speeds is smaller than the difference of the mean speeds of both beams and that magnetic field effects in the beam overlap region are negligible .",
    "negligible here means that the electron gyrofrequency is small compared to the growth rates of the instabilities .",
    "we obtain under these conditions the two - stream instability , the oblique mode instability and the filamentation or beam - weibel instability .",
    "these instabilities are discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we summarize their properties .",
    "let @xmath6 and @xmath7 be the wave vector of the growing waves and the difference vector between the mean velocities of the counter - streaming electron beams , respectively .",
    "let @xmath8 be the angle between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the two - stream instability @xcite is purely electrostatic for @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "it saturates by the formation of electron phase space holes in the nonrelativistic @xcite and relativistic regimes @xcite . the coalescence instability @xcite triggers the collapse of these nonlinear structures , which thermalizes the electron flow .",
    "what remains from the two counter - streaming electron beams is a single hot electron distribution with a low mean speed modulus .",
    "the net current is small and the magnetic field it drives is weak .",
    "the two - stream instability grows slower than the oblique mode instability if @xmath11 .",
    "the oblique modes have a mixed polarity and they are almost electrostatic .",
    "their wave vectors @xmath6 form angles @xmath12 with respect to @xmath7 and they become two - stream unstable modes if @xmath13 .",
    "they also saturate by electron trapping @xcite .",
    "both instabilities thermalize the electrons electrostatically .",
    "if the counter - streaming electron beams have a similar density and temperature and if they collide at a moderately relativistic speed , then both electrostatic instabilities are outgrown by the filamentation instability @xcite .",
    "the latter is driven by the magnetic repulsion of electrons , which move into opposite directions .",
    "it saturates by magnetic trapping @xcite and its final state are current channels , which contain charged particles that have the same current direction .",
    "these channels have a diameter of the order of the electron skin depth and are surrounded by strong magnetic fields . the plasma flow is eventually thermalized through the repeated mergers of the current channels",
    ". however , the magnetic fields remain strong in a broad spatial interval @xcite .",
    "our 2d pic simulation , which uses the 2d3v code lapine @xcite , resolves a cross - section of the target that contains the surface normal .",
    "the electron flow at the rear surface is thus confined to a layer close to the one - dimensional surface with a width that is comparable to an electron skin depth .",
    "the colliding electron sheaths can drive two instabilities in this geometry .",
    "the two - stream instability , which results in electrostatic oscillations along the surface direction , and the filamentation instability , which separates both electron beams along the surface normal .",
    "our simulation demonstrates that for the selected initial conditions the magnetic interaction is more important than the electrostatic one . a laser - plasma experiment with similar initial conditions",
    "would thus allow us to drive the filamentation instability on the two - dimensional surface of the target .",
    "the experimentally measured data can be compared to the existing 2d and 3d simulation studies ( see for example @xcite ) of colliding leptonic flows and test their validity .",
    "studying this instability with a controlled laboratory experiment would provide us with a much needed better understanding of the magnetic field generation within gamma - ray burst ( grb ) jets , which are spectacular releases of energetic electromagnetic radiation at cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "a direct comparison of the filaments observed in a controlled laboratory experiment and those believed to exist close to the internal shocks of grbs is possible if the plasma is collisionless , because then all observables can be scaled between both systems with the help of the electron plasma frequency @xcite .",

    "<S> most energetic electrons are bound to the rear surface by the ambipolar electric field and expand along it . </S>",
    "<S> their current is closed by a return current in the target , and this current configuration generates strong surface magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the two electron sheaths collide at the midplane between the laser impact points . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic repulsion between the counter - streaming electron beams separates them along the surface normal direction , before they can thermalize through other beam instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> this magnetic repulsion is also the driving mechanism for the beam - weibel ( filamentation ) instability , which is thought to be responsible for magnetic field growth close to the internal shocks of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) jets . </S>",
    "<S> the relative strength of this repulsion compared to the competing electrostatic interactions , which is evidenced by the simulations , suggests that the filamentation instability can be examined in an experimental setting . </S>"
