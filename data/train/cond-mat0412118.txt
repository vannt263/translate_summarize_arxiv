    "one important difference is that arpes gives direct information on angular variations around the fermi surface while optics involves an average over all the quasiparticles participating in the absorption . even if these anisotropies are not accounted for ( isotropic system ) there remain additional differences which have their fundamental origin in the fact that arpes measures directly the quasiparticle spectral density @xmath0 at fixed quasiparticle momentum * k * as a function of energy @xmath1 while optics involves the current - current correlation function which depends on the product of two spectral densities@xcite at the same momentum * k * but with frequencies displaced by the photon energy .    in this paper",

    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "( this is because the gap @xmath131 is bigger now . )",
    "this demonstrates once more that no exact correspondence between size and position of the structure in @xmath51 and @xmath3 is possible without a detailed analysis , particularly for extended spectra .",
    "also these functions strongly reflect the energy dependence of the underlying quasiparticle density of states that exists in the superconducting state ( dotted curve , bottom frame of fig .",

    "while the underlying @xmath3 is the same in both cases yet the amount of structure seen in the solid curve is much more pronounced than it is for the dotted curve .",
    "this is due entirely to the energy dependence of the quasiparticle density of states ( dashed line , bottom frame of fig .",

    "we turn next to the exact correspondence between @xmath11 and the quasiparticle scattering rates given as twice the imaginary part of the self energy . in the previous section we have already examined this relation but based our discussion on approximations for the conductivity formula .",
    "next we use the more exact eq .   and solutions of the full eliashberg equations .",
    "we return to the model function @xmath83 defined in sec .",

    "[ fig:5 ] for @xmath11 defined as @xmath139 and @xmath140 we note in passing , that for small @xmath1 the optical effective mass formula is dominated by the imaginary part of the optical conductivity @xmath141 in the superconducting state because it diverges as @xmath142 for small @xmath1 with coefficients proportional to the inverse square of the penetration depth .",
    "this is not related to a quasiparticle effective mass , but is rather a property of the condensate itself .",
    "nevertheless , this is what has been done traditionally and we need to follow this procedure here to make contact with the literature .",
    "an alternate approach would be to subtract out of the imaginary part of the optical conductivity the condensate contribution before forming the ratios indicated in eqs .   and .",
    "in this alternate approach the resulting @xmath143 and @xmath144 would refer directly only to the normal fluid part of the optical conductivity and so would be more closely related to quasiparticle properties .",

    "we present two frames , the left hand frame is for the normal state and the other frame for the superconducting state .",
    "all results are at temperature @xmath121k . for ease of comparison with @xmath11 ( dashed lines )",
    "it is @xmath148 ( solid lines ) and @xmath149 ( dotted lines ) that is shown .",
    "even when a factor of one half is included to make magnitude more comparable , the optical scattering rates differ significantly from the quasiparticle scattering rates .",
    "on the other hand , in the normal state the model scattering rate agrees almost perfectly with the quasiparticle scattering rate ( top left hand frame ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath83 should be used in comparison with arpes data and not @xmath11 .",
    "the close correspondence between model and optical rates is , however , lost when the superconducting state is considered ( top right hand frame ) .",
    "the solid curve is significantly different from the dotted curve . in particular , @xmath83 is smaller at small @xmath1 and rises faster around @xmath153mev after which it stays significantly above its quasiparticle counterpart up to almost @xmath154mev where the two curves cross again .",
    "these differences have their origin in the energy dependence of the superconducting quasiparticle density of states ( solid line , bottom frame of fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) and have nothing to do with the boson structure . for a comparison of @xmath11 ( optics ) and @xmath147 ( arpes ) based completely on experiment ,",
    "the reader is refered to kaminski _",
    "et al._@xcite    when the underlying @xmath3 is more structured , as is the case for the ybco@xmath124 spectrum ( dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) , the correspondence between @xmath83 and @xmath147 is not as good as is seen in the two bottom frames of fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "there is a small additional oscillation in the model case , not present in the self energy . nevertheless , the agreement between them is still much closer than is the case for the optical rate ( dashed curve ) .",
    "note , however , that for the superconducting state the disagreement between @xmath147 ( solid curve ) and @xmath83 ( dotted curve ) is now much greater and , in particular , a large peak is seen in the model curve which is not there in the dotted curve .",
    "this peak can be related to the broad shoulder in the quasiparticle density of states which follows the logarithmic singularity ( dotted line , bottom frame of fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "we have analyzed the relationship between the boson structure seen in the quasiparticle self energy ( be it real or imaginary part ) measured in arpes experiments and the corresponding structure seen in the optical memory function determined in the infrared conductivity measurements .",
    "starting first with the real part of the self energy a @xmath114-function peak at @xmath43 in the quasiparticle - boson spectral density @xmath3 shows up as a logarithmic - like peak at @xmath43 in the normal state . in the superconducting state a gap develops in the quasiparticle density of states and",
    "this introduces further structures in quasiparticle quantities .",
    "this effectively shifts to higher energy the normal state boson structure , broadens it , and can make it appear more prominent . for an @xmath132-wave gap",
    "the shift would be @xmath131 ( gap amplitude ) but for @xmath4-wave it is somewhat less because a distribution of gap values is involved .",
    "by contrast , for the memory function the boson structure in the optical mass renormalization is at @xmath57 in the normal state rather than at @xmath7 and it is much less prominent . only a very small peak results which greatly reduces the value of such measurements for determining boson structure as was attempted recently in ref .  .",
    "again , the boson structure shifts in the superconducting state and can also appear more prominent as a result of the additional modulation brought about by the opening of a gap . these modifications , however , have nothing to do with the structures in @xmath3 . the two effects are not additive and require a full non linear eliashberg analysis to disentangle in detail as we have provided here . when extended rather than @xmath114-function spectra are used",
    ", the situation is even more complex .",
    "for example , a rather broad peak in @xmath3 , as in the mmp form for spin fluctuations produces no peak at all , even in the superconducting state .",
    "so far we have described only the real part of the self energy and equivalent optical quantity .",
    "much the same can be said about scattering rates . for a @xmath114-function @xmath3 ,",
    "the quasiparticle scattering rate jumps from zero to a finite value at @xmath43 and remains unchanged after that . on the other hand ,",
    "the optical scattering rate starts from zero at @xmath43 and increases gradually towards the same finite value which it only attains at very high @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the signature of a @xmath114-function is not singular as it is for the quasiparticle case .",
    "we have also found that in the normal state a new model scattering rate can be introduced which we denote @xmath81 and define as @xmath155/d\\omega$ ] .",
    "it is completely determined from optical data and has the advantage that it follows much more closely the @xmath1 dependence of the quasiparticle scattering rate than does @xmath2 itself .",
    "its kk - transform is very close to the real part of the quasiparticle self energy .",
    "we propose that it is this quantity that should be used in comparison between arpes and optical experimental data",
    ". the comparison will be close in isotropic systems and in the anisotropic case , the model quantity gives an average over all directions in the brillouin zone . in the superconducting state",
    "no such simple comparison between arpes and optics is possible .",
    "this needs to be kept in mind when analyzing experimental data , particularly in studies aimed at deriving boson structure from such data .",
    "this fact does not seem to have always been appreciated in analysis of experimental data , where features , at least partially associated with the superconducting quasiparticle density of states , has been assigned to boson structure .",
    "the model spectral density @xmath3 consisting of an mmp form with superimposed the @xmath114-peak was used to demonstrate that optics as well as arpes just pick up the sharp structures and do not give direct information on a possible coupling to a smooth background .",
    "nevertheless , it may well be that it is precisely this coupling of the quasiparticles to such a background which is primarily responsible for superconductivity .",
