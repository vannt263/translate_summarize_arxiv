    "certain integrable geometries , such as a disc,@xcite allow states that exclude perpendicular incidence , so that electrons can be effectively confined in a disc - shaped region of graphene with finite carrier density , surrounded by a carrier - free ( _ i.e. , _ undoped , intrinsic ) graphene sheet . on the other hand , for geometries with a chaotic classical dynamics ,",
    "no such exclusion of perpendicular incidence is possible , and one may expect that no bound states exist in this case . in ref .  , as well as in",

    "perpendicular incidence on the boundary of the quantum dot corresponds to zero angular momentum , so that no states with perpendicular incidence on the surface exist .",
    "this then explains why a stadium - shaped quantum dot still shows conductance resonances , in spite of the naive classical expectation that geometries with a chaotic classical dynamics can not be used to confine electrons .    in order to support these arguments , in this article we study gate - defined graphene quantum dots in which the berry phase is compensated by the aharonov - bohm phase from a magnetic flux tube through the quantum dot .",
