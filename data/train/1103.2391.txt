    "inflation has become the standard paradigm for explaining the homogeneity and the isotropy of our observed universe @xcite . during this epoch the energy density of the universe was dominated by some scalar field ( the inflaton ) , with negligible kinetic energy density , such that the corresponding vacuum energy density was the responsible for the exponential growth of the scale factor of the universe . during this phase a small and smooth region of the order of size of the hubble radius grew so large that it easily encompassed the comoving volume of the entire presently observed universe .",
    "this is the reason for which the observed universe is so homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "furthermore , it is now clear that structure in the universe comes primarily from an almost scale - invariant super - horizon curvature perturbation .",
    "this perturbation originates presumably from the vacuum fluctuation , during the almost - exponential inflation , of some field with mass much less than the hubble parameter @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , any scalar field whose mass is lighter than @xmath2 suffered , in a ( quasi ) de sitter epoch , with a scale independent quantum fluctuations spectrum@xcite .    during inflation ,",
    "particle production can only occur for particles that are light compared to the hubble scale without classical conformal invariance ; gravitons and massless minimally coupled scalars and light fermions are unique in that respect .",
    "particle creation during inflation was studied many years ago in the framework of standard inflation@xcite .",
    "the process appeared to be straightforward : in models like new inflation and chaotic inflation@xcite .",
    "these models incorporate a second order phase transition to end inflation , the inflaton field would wind up oscillating around the minimum of its potential near the end of inflation .",
    "these oscillations would produce a sea of relativistic particles , if one added ( by hand ) interaction terms between the inflaton and these lighter species .",
    "the direct production from vacuum fluctuations during inflation of x - particle was considered in@xcite .",
    "particle creation has been also considered in warm inflationary@xcite and fresh inflationary@xcite scenarios .",
    "more recently , particle creation during inflation was considered in a model of brane inflation where two stacks of mobile branes are moving ultra relativistically in a warped throat@xcite .",
    "after inflation , the universe could have suffered a phase transition from a de sitter vacuum dominated state to a decelerated radiation dominated stage . at this moment , a great amount of the potential density energy is transferred to radiation energy density due to the decay of the inflaton field produced by its interaction with other boson fields@xcite .",
    "some years ago kaiser@xcite demonstrated that particles produced from the parametric resonance effect when @xmath3 is fewer than in the @xmath4 case , but can still be exponentially greater than when the resonance is neglected altogether .    on the other hand , in a previous work@xcite we studied the scalar metric fluctuations of a 5d spacetime background metric @xmath5 , which is riemann - flat and hence ricci - flat : @xmath6 . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", the campbell - magaard theorem@xcite serves as a ladder to go between manifolds whose dimensionality differs by one .",
    "this theorem , which is valid in any number of dimensions , implies that every solution of the 4d einstein equations with arbitrary energy momentum tensor can be embedded , at least locally , in a solution of the 5d einstein field equations in vacuum .",
    "because of this , the stress - energy may be a 4d manifestation of the embedding geometry .",
    "physically , the background metric there employed describes a 5d extension of an usual de sitter spacetime .",
    "inflationary cosmology can be recovered from a 5d vacuum@xcite . other version of 5d gravity , which is mathematically similar , is the membrane theory . in this theory gravity propagates freely on the 5d bulk and the interactions of particles are confined to a 4d hypersurface called `` brane''@xcite",

    ", we shall consider the solutions obtained at the end of inflation from a 5d vacuum on an effective 4d hypersurface described by a de sitter metric .",
    "after it , we shall use the bogoliubov formalism to calculate the modes solution for the fields after a phase transition to a radiation dominated epoch .",
    "the topic here studied is very important , because the case of inflaton decay into further inflatons may be of interest for dark matter searches .",
    "following their production , the inflatons would decouple from the rest of matter@xcite .",

    "<S> the modes of the inflaton field fluctuations and the scalar fluctuations of the metric at the end of inflation are obtained by using a recently introduced formalism related to the induced matter theory of gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the interesting result is that the number of created particles is bigger than @xmath0 on cosmological scales . </S>",
