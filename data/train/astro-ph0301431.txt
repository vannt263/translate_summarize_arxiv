    "rapid variability in intra - day variable ( idv ) sources is a long - standing problem as it implies apparent brightness temperatures in the radio regime which may exceed 10@xmath3 k , or requires relativistic beaming with extremely high doppler factors , coherent radiation mechanisms , or special geometric effects ( wagner & witzel 1995 ) . such high brightness temperatures would be well above the `` compton catastrophe '' limit @xmath4  k imposed by inverse - compton scattering ( kellermann & paulini - toth 1969 , slysh 1992 , kardashev 2000 ) when the photon energy density in the emission region exceeds the energy density in the magnetic field .",

    ", one can convert the observed 4.8  ghz flux to intensity , and obtain a variability brightness temperature of @xmath9  k. in this source , however , kedziora - chudczer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) interpret the very short variability time as due interstellar scintillation requiring the angular diameter of the most compact component to be @xmath10 micro - arcsec , or smaller , corresponding to a solid angle subtended by the idv core @xmath11 where @xmath12  sr .",
    "the fraction of the total flux they estimated to be associated with this compact idv core is @xmath13 , and the corresponding brightness temperature at 4.8  ghz is @xmath14  k. although much lower than @xmath15 , to reconcile this brightness temperature with the @xmath16  k limit would appear to require a very large doppler factor , @xmath17 , or an even larger angular diameter . to obtain a doppler factor as large as @xmath18 would require not only a jet lorentz factor of @xmath19 , but also very close alignment of the jet axis to our line of sight ( within @xmath20 ) .",
    "the probability of such an alignment occurring by chance is then @xmath21 , in this case , which makes the very high doppler factor possibility unattractive .",
    "the effective distance to the interstellar scintillation screen is crucial in determining the angular size of the source , and hence its brightness temperature .",
    "the distance used by kedziora - chudczer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and walker ( 1998 ) is effectively the scale - height above the galactic plane of electron number density squared , i.e.  @xmath22 , for which @xmath23  pc in the model of taylor and cordes ( 1993 ) for the free electron distribution in the galaxy .",
    "however , that model was developed mainly for the consistent determination of pulsar distances from dispersion measures , and is most accurate at low galactic latitudes where the majority of pulsars are observed .",
    "taylor and cordes ( 1993 ) themselves warn that one should be aware of uncertainties in their model associated with this",
    ". the column density , @xmath24 , is fairly accurately determined , but the scale height of electron number density , @xmath25 , is less well determined , and @xmath26 is even less accurately known .",
    "for example , in the recent model of gomez et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for the free electron distribution in the galaxy @xmath27  pc .",
    "it is interesting to note that beckert et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggest typical distances to the scattering medium of 200  pc , and that a scale height of about 100  pc seems to be required to explain idv in the case of 0917 + 624 .",
    "krichbaum et al .  (",
    "2002 ) mention the possibility of an extremely clumpy ism . if this is the case , one could well question the use of an effective screen distance as it could be that the scintillation is due to an individual ionized cloud much nearer to us than the average distance .",
    "in fact , if the distribution is highly peaked in the galactic plane the most probable , rather than average , distance is small .",
    "the distance to the ionized cloud responsible for the extreme scattering event in 0954 + 658 is estimated to be @xmath28  pc ( cimo 2002 ) , while dennett - thorpe & de bruyn ( 2000 , 2002 ) suggest that the scattering region for idv in j1819 + 3845 may be located at about 20  pc , and possibly associated with the local bubble .",
    "hence , i believe there could be considerable uncertainty in the distance to the scintillating material responsible for the extreme idv in pks  0405 - 385 . if , for example , the distance were smaller by a factor of 5 , this would translate into a factor of 25 reduction in the brightness temperature . a brightness temperature of @xmath29  k at @xmath30  ghz for the idv core in pks  0405 - 385 is still high , but",
    "i will show that it can be achieved by standard electron synchrotron radiation using quite moderate doppler factors if one takes into account possible geometries of the emission region .    in a recent paper ( protheroe 2002 )",
    "i have explored the effect of emission region geometry on flux variability , and on the relationship between observed intensity and energy density for various source geometries for the case of optically thin emission and found that the average energy density in the source can be much less than one would estimate simply from the observed intensity .",
    "although the radio emission from idv sources is usually assumed to be optically thick , if this is not the case then the above result may also have important implications for idv sources as the photon energy density responsible for causing the brightness temperature limit may actually be a few orders of magnitude lower than estimated from the intensity . in that case",
    ", lower doppler factors would be required to avoid the compton catastrophe . in this paper",
    "i shall explore the parameter space , including emission region geometry , of models able to reproduce the observed radio emission of the idv core of pks  0405 - 385 , and i shall model its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from radio to gamma - ray frequencies .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : tb ] , i plot the available flux measurements of pks  0405 - 385 , divided by frequency squared , as gray symbols and gray vertical lines",
    ". contemporaneous vla and atca data ( squares and triangles in the 1.4  ghz43  ghz range ) are also re - plotted as black symbols at the observed fluxes multiplied by @xmath31 , the fraction of the total flux assumed by kedziora - chudczer et al.(1997 ) to be associated with the idv core .",

    ", the intensity can be fitted well by @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "such a spectrum would occur naturally if the emission were optically thin and if this frequency range were well below the critical frequency of the lowest energy electron .",

    "for the purposes of this paper , i shall adopt a mono - energetic electron distribution .",
    "for a mono - energetic isotropic electron distribution the synchrotron emission coefficient is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the electron number density ( @xmath42 ) , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( see e.g.  rybicki and lightman 1979 ) . at low frequencies",

    "hence , @xmath60 can be used to estimate the lorentz factor of the electrons .",
    "as noted earlier , the data appear to show @xmath61 over the 1.4  ghz43  ghz range corresponding to the contemporaneous idv observations . at other frequencies",
    "it is not known whether the observed emission is due to the same compact component , or is due to a larger region , perhaps farther along the jet .",
    "however , data at other frequencies may still be used to constrain the models .",
    "since the brightness temperature at low frequencies is proportional to the electron lorentz factor , the brightness temperature problem is minimized by using the lowest possible lorentz factor .",
    "i therefore take the highest frequency @xmath57 which is just consistent with the 1.4  ghz data , and adopt @xmath62  hz . apart from the normalization , for which i choose to take @xmath63  erg @xmath64s@xmath65hz@xmath65 ( after multiplying by @xmath13 ) , the other parameter determining the fit is the value of the critical frequency @xmath66 .",
    "the lowest critical frequency @xmath66 which is consistent with the 43  ghz radio data is @xmath67  hz , and the highest critical frequency consistent with the r - band data is @xmath68  hz , and i shall adopt these two values in my modeling .",
    "the resulting brightness temperature fits are shown by the solid curves in fig .  [",
    "fig : tb ] .",
    "the challenge is now to find a combination of source parameters , i.e.  doppler factor , jet - frame magnetic field , electron number density and emission region geometry , that gives the required intensity , and is physically possible .",
    "if one views the emission region along the jet axis , one obtains the largest doppler boosting for any given jet lorentz factor , and i shall assume this to be the case for pks  0405 - 385 .",
    "this may well be justified as such extreme idv radio quasars are extremely rare .",
    "generally , the lower the energy density of synchrotron radiation photons in the emission region , the lower will be the doppler factor required to avoid the compton catastrophe on synchrotron photons .",
    "however , as i shall show , very large doppler factors can cause a compton catastrophe on cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) photons .",
    "i shall discuss the dependence of synchrotron photon energy density on the geometry of the emission region in the next section .",
    "in a separate paper ( protheroe 2002 ) i have discussed the influence of emission region geometry on photon energy density in the emission region for the optically thin case . here",
    "i shall extend this work to include optical depth effects and use a cylindrical emission region .",
    "i shall consider the case of a cylinder of length @xmath69 and radius @xmath70 , with uniform emissivity @xmath71 and absorption coefficient @xmath72 , and determine the photon energy density @xmath73 averaged over the volume of the cylinder .    at some arbitrary point @xmath74 within the cylinder",

    "of course for emission in the jet frame , all the variables in equation  ( [ eq : uphot_tau ] ) would be jet - frame variables .    while the average energy density inside the cylinder is fixed for any set of @xmath90 , and @xmath70 , the intensity observed when viewing the cylinder can depend strongly on viewing direction . in order to obtain the highest observed intensity one would look in a direction such that the projected area of the cylinder is smallest . making the axis of the cylinder coincident with the jet axis ,",
    "this would be achieved if one viewed the emission region at @xmath91 if the cylinder was short ( @xmath92 ) , and for @xmath93 if the cylinder was long ( @xmath94 ) , where primed coordinates correspond to jet - frame variables .",

    "because of the dominance of ic losses on the cmbr for models a  d , one would expect the ssc peak at gamma - ray energies in the sed to exceed the synchrotron peak for these models .",

    "as expected from equation  [ eq : d_model ] , increasing @xmath66 from @xmath210  hz to @xmath103  hz reduces @xmath7 by a factor of 10 if one keeps all other parameters fixed ( note , however , that this reduction in @xmath7 is accompanied by an increase in @xmath104 ) .",

    "increasing @xmath99 from 1 to 316 results in a reduction in @xmath7 by a factor of @xmath215 ( plus a reduction in @xmath104 ) if one keeps all other variables fixed .",
    "models k  o in fig .",
    "[ fig : parameters](b ) have all other parameters the same as models f  j , and the resulting seds are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed](c ) . because of the reduction in synchrotron photon energy density associated with @xmath94 ,",
    "although not identical , the seds of models k  o are qualitatively similar to those of models f  j , with model o being ruled out by both the gamma - ray limit and the x - ray data , although again i note that these data are not contemporaneuos with the idv data .",
    "models k  n have @xmath212@xmath216  rad and @xmath2178 .",
    "model m , having @xmath129 only @xmath30 times that assumed by kedziora - chudczer et al .  ( 1997 ) has a doppler factor of @xmath218 , and lower doppler factors are possible with , for example even larger @xmath99 .",
    "bearing in mind that no attempt has been made to fit the ( non - contemporaneous ) x - ray and gamma - ray data , and that a simple mono - energetic electron spectrum has been used , it seems that models which are able to fit the idv radio data tend to predict observable fluxes of x - ray , and/or gamma ray emission at sub - gev and/or @xmath21910 gev energies .",
    "use of a more sophisticated electron spectrum is unlikely to alter this conclusion .",
    "hence , it may well be profitable for space gamma ray telescopes such as integral and glast , and southern hemisphere atmospheric cherenkov telescopes such as hess and cangaroo iii to look for emission from pks  0405 - 385 and other extreme idv radio galaxies .",
    "the rapid intra - day variability in pks  0405 - 385 is almost certainly due to interstellar scintillation effects .",
    "the radio flux does , however , also vary on longer timescales  10 per cent change in 2 months in july 1996 ( corresponding to @xmath220  yr for 50 per cent change ) , and has very intense for periods of about a month ( kedziora - chudczer et al .",
    "1997 ) .    a mechanism that may cause such variability would be the emission region moving along the jet and passing a region where external factors cause compression / expansion of the emission region , increasing / decreasing the magnetic field , and causing adiabatic acceleration / deceleration of relativistic charged particles , thereby affecting the observed intensity .",
    "change can also occur as a result of the emission region passing through a bend in the jet causing , amongst other things , a change in viewing angle with respect to the motion of the emission region , and hence a change in doppler factor .    for the examples",
    "above , the observer - frame variability time depends on the geometry of the emission region ( see , e.g. , protheroe 2002 ) and , for viewing the assumed cylindrical emission region along its axis , is at least @xmath221 .",
    "in general , arbitrarily low doppler factors are possible for arbitrarily high @xmath99 .",
    "however , in this case this is clearly at the expense of having a time scale for variability which may be unreasonably large , and of course also requires the jet to be extremely well collimated over the length of the emission region .",
    "alternatively a shock may pass through the emission region compressing the magnetic field and accelerating particles  a pre - existing mono - energetic population of relativistic particles will receive an energy boost by a factor of @xmath222 and acquire a power - law tail as a result of diffusive shock acceleration . in the case of a plane shock moving at jet - frame speed @xmath223 along the jet ( see , e.g. protheroe 2002 ) ,",
    "the observer - frame variability time in our case ( @xmath93 ) is at least @xmath224 which is longer ( shorter ) than @xmath221 if @xmath225 is less than ( greater than ) 0.5 for a forward - moving shock .    except for a point - like emission region following a bent or helical trajectory such that the doppler boosting factor , changes rapidly with time , the variability time can not be shorter than the observer - frame energy - loss time scale , @xmath226 .",
    "this is easily obtained from equation  ( [ eq : dedt ] ) and is plotted ( thin curves ) against doppler factor in fig .",
    "[ fig : dopp_tvar ] for the following cases : @xmath201 , @xmath131 and @xmath227 ( solid curves ) @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath227 ( dotted curves ) ; and @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath228 ( dashed curves ) . as noted above , the variability time will in general be longer than the energy - loss time scale due to the dimensions of the emission region . for the present geometry and viewing angle ,",
    "i take the variability time to be @xmath229 ^ 2\\right\\}^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but one should note that in the case of shock excitation that it can be longer than this for @xmath230 , or as short as @xmath226 if @xmath231 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dopp_tvar ] , i have also plotted @xmath232 vs.@xmath7 for the same three cases , and the values for models a  o are indicated by the letters . of the models with doppler factors less than @xmath233 ,",
    "models c  e give variability times @xmath22030 years .",
    "models f  j give variability times of @xmath220 week to @xmath234 month , and are quite compatible with the long - term variability observed for pks  0405 - 385 .",
    "models k  o , with larger @xmath99 , give variability times of @xmath220 month to @xmath235 years , with model m having @xmath236  year .",
    "to obtain low doppler factors , without invoking extreme variations from equipartition , requires a larger angular diameter for the idv core of pks  0405 - 385 than the @xmath10  micro - arcsec assumed by kedziora - chudczer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) corresponding to a distance of @xmath237  pc to the ionized material responsible for the interstellar scintillation .",
    "a further reduction in the minimum doppler factor needed to avoid the compton catastrophe can be obtained by having optically thin idv core emission , preferably originating from a region elongated along the jet , and observing it at a small viewing angle with respect to the jet axis .",
    "an angular diameter a factor of @xmath2154 larger than assumed by kedziora - chudczer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and walker ( 1998 ) corresponds roughly to models d , h  i and m ",
    "n , all of which are allowed by the present data , and have doppler factors @xmath238 , 8020 and 308 , respectively .",
    "interstellar scintillation screen distances as small as 20  pc , possibly associated with material in the local bubble , have previously been invoked to explain idv in j1819 + 3845 ( dennett - thorpe & de bruyn 2000 , 2002 ) . by using a distance of 20  pc",
    ", even lower doppler factors could easily fit the observations .    in conclusion , if one observes optically thin emission along a long narrow emission region , the average energy density in the emission region can be significantly lower than @xmath239 .",
    "if one takes into account the uncertainty in the distance to the ionized clouds responsible for interstellar scintillation causing rapid idv in pks  0405 - 385 the brightness temperature could be as low as @xmath2  k , or lower , at 5  ghz .",
    "the radio spectrum can be fit by @xmath61 expected if the emission is optically thin and the electrons are mono - energetic , or have a minimum lorentz factor whose critical frequency is well above the frequency range of interest .",
    "such a spectrum would occur naturally in models in which @xmath240 are produced as secondaries of interactions of protons , e.g.  by bethe - heitler pair production , or through @xmath241 decay following collisions of with matter or low - energy target photons ( pion photoproduction ) by protons , or by neutrons themselves produced in pion photoproduction interactions ( e.g.  @xmath242 ) perhaps closer to the central engine .",
    "the combination of all these factors enables the compton catastrophe to be avoided , and also predicts that x - ray and gamma - ray emission at observable flux levels should be expected from compact cores of extreme idv sources such as pks  0405 - 385 .",
