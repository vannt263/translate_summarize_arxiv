    "among close binaries there is a group of cataclysmic variable stars ( cvs ) consisting of a white dwarf ( the primary ) that accretes matter from a secondary star via roche lobe overflow .",
    "the secondary component usually resembles a low - mass main - sequence star .",
    "the variety of observed features in the light curves of cvs leads to a sophisticated taxonomy ( warner 1995 ) . in cvs with a weak magnetic field ( @xmath2 g ) an accretion disk is formed around the primary . the hot spot ( or bright spot )",
    "is the region where the accreted matter collides with the edge of the disk .    based on the photometric behaviour , among cvs",
    "there is a group called dwarf novae ( dns ) of a su uma type .",
    "this class of objects has short orbital periods ( @xmath3 h ) . in the light curves of su uma type stars",
    "there are present regular sudden increases of brightness called outbursts or superoutbursts .",
    "outbursts are more frequent then superoutbursts . also , observed brightness of su uma stars during superoutbursts is about one magnitude higher than during outbursts .",
    "additionally , in the light curves of su uma type dns during superoutbursts there are characteristic periodic light oscillatons called superhumps ( more in hellier 2001 ) .",
    "iy uma was discovered by takamizawa ( 1998 , vsnet - obs circulation 18078 ) .",
    "this variable was classified as a new deeply eclipsing su uma type dn after its january 2000 superoutburst with clear superhumps manifestation ( uemura et al .",
    "2000 , patterson et al .",
    "2000 , stanishev et al .",
    ". steeghs et al .",
    "( 2003 ) conducted high speed photometry of iy uma during quiescence and based on analyzed eclipses the most up - to - date orbital period of @xmath4 days was derived . moreover , in the light curves of eclipses of iy uma they detected a curious short - lived rise of brightness which occurs between the end of white dwarf ingress and hot spot ingress .",
    "data presented by steeghs et al .",
    "( 2003 ) were reanalyzed by smak ( 2003 ) who postulated stream overflow for this eclipsing dn .",
    "about normal outbursts in iy uma only two publications have been published so far .",
    "three normal outbursts with duration around @xmath5 days , in april 2000 , december 2000 and march 2001 were reported by kato et al .",
    "also , rolfe et al .",
    "( 2005 ) observed one normal outburst of iy uma during two nights in january 2001 .",
    "detection of these eruptions indicates that iy uma goes into normal outburst several times per year .",
    "nonetheless , the hot spot brightness of iy uma has not been investigated before , during and after normal outbursts , hence our motivation for this analysis .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows : in section 2 there is information about observations , data reduction and photometry analysis .",
    "section 3 presents global photometric behaviour of iy uma .",
    "later , in section 4 we show the result of the decomposition analysis .",
    "discussion is presented in section 5 , followed by our conclusions .",
    "observations of iy uma presented in this work were gathered during 6 nights between 2012 april 17 and 2015 october 15 . in this campaign we observed the variable in quiescence ( 2 nights - 2012 april 17/18 and 23/24 ) , during one normal outburst ( 1 night - 2013 march 05/06 ) and again at minimum brightness ( 3 nights - 2013 march 06/07 , 2015 october 14/15 and 15/16 ) .",
    "table 1 presents a full journal of our ccd observations of iy uma .",
    "the object was monitored during 14.16 hours .",
    "we obtained 1069 useful exposures .",
    "all data from 2012 and 2013 were collected at the ostrowik station of the warsaw university observatory .",
    "iy uma was observed on 60-cm cassegrain telescope equipped with a tektronics tk512cb back - illuminated ccd camera .",
    "the scale of the camera was 0.76 arcsec / pixel providing a 6.5 x 6.5 field of view .",
    "the description of the camera and the telescope was presented by udalski and pych ( 1992 ) . to obtain the shortest possible exposure times the object",
    "was observed in `` white light '' .",
    "the exposure times varied from 80 to 120 seconds depending of the brightness of the star , the seeing and the sky transparency .",
    "observations of iy uma from 2015 were obtained at the mdm observatory with the 1.3 meter mcgraw hill telescope located on kitt peak mountain in arizona .",
    "data were collected with a thinned , backside - illuminated ikon du-937n ccd camera built by andor technology plc .",
    "the active area was 512 x 512 pixels , each 13 @xmath6 m square .",
    "exposure times were between 10 and 15 seconds and the dead time between exposures was only 11.92 ms . the star was monitored in a schott gg420 filter .",
    "the iraf package was used for the standard correction for bias , flat - field and dark frames .",
    "daophotii package ( stetson 1987 ) was used for profile photometry .",
    "the relative unfiltered magnitude of iy uma was obtained by taking the difference between the magnitude of the object and the mean magnitude of two comparison stars . in fig.1 the map of the observed region is presented where iy uma is marked as v1 and the two comparison stars are marked as c1 and c2 , respectively .",
    "the typical accuracy of our measurements varied between 0.029 mag and 0.174 mag for data set from poland and from 0.013 mag to 0.043 mag for observations from the u.s.a . , depending on the weather conditions and the brightness of the star .",
    "the median value of the photometric errors was 0.054 mag and 0.027 mag for ostrowik and mdm observatory , respectively .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab3 ]    in fig.4 ( from the top panel to the bottom )",
    "the spot light curves were displayed .",
    "the amplitude of brightness of the hot spot was enormous ( reaching over @xmath7 ) before the outburst ( top panel ) . in the second panel ( from the top )",
    "the reconstructed hot spot from the march 2012 outburst is presented and one can see that the hump amplitude dropped dramatically below @xmath8 . in the third and the fourth panels ( from the top ) we present the hot spot after the outburst , the hump amplitude was again on its average level ( above @xmath7 ) .",
    "in fig.5 we display the light curve of the iy uma during quiescence and the normal outburst ( top panel ) and the amplitude of the hot spot ( bottom panel ) . in our opinion",
    ", there is a strong dependence between the activity of iy uma and the hot spot brightness .",
    "lately , there has been an intense discussion about dns models ( for review bkowska & olech 2014 ) .",
    "analysis of eclipsing dns ( smak 1994bc , 2007 , 2008ab , bkowska & olech 2014 ) turned out to be milestones in favour of the emt model in a recent debate about the superoutbursts and superhump mechanisms .    during normal outbursts in dns",
    "the accretion disk brightens by factor 10 - 100 for a few days as a result of a sudden increase in mass accretion .",
    "bath ( 1975 ) proposed the mass transfer instability model ( mti ) where the outbursts are caused by a burst of mass transfer from the donor star . in the thermal - viscous disk - instability model ( dim )",
    "a bimodal behaviour of the viscosity as a function of the surface density is responsible for the sudden increase in the mass transfer through the disk ( see reviews by smak 1984 , lasota 2001).the behaviour of the bright spot of iy uma during its march 2012 outburst is similar to the one observed in oy car ( check fig.1 in rutten et al .",
    "the april 1979 normal outburst in oy car was observed by voght ( 1981 , 1983 ) and reanalized by rutten et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and before the normal outburst the spot was clearly visible but it was gradually disappearing during the development of the outburst which offered no support for the mass - transfer instability model",
    ". however , baptista ( 2012 ) analysed the mechanisms of accretion disks evolutions during outbursts in several eclipsing dns .",
    "based on the observational evidences there are two classes of dns and during the outbursts one group follows the dim scenario ( e.g. z cha , oy car , ip peg ) and while the behaviour of the others ( e.g. ex dra , ht cas , v2051 oph ) can be explained in terms of the mti . in case of our data set of iy",
    "uma observations during normal outburst , we conclude that iy uma behaves in accordance with the dim framework .",
    "nevertheless , the models describing normal outbursts should continue to be analysed since no consensus has been reached yet .",
    "the decomposition method for the eclipsing dns to investigate the hot spot brightness was applied only a few times ( check table 3 in bkowska & olech 2014 ) but it has already proven useful as it shed some light on the superoutburst mechanism . in the case of ht cas time span between two successive superoutbursts",
    "is about 25 years , also normal outbursts are a unique and rare phenomenon . according to kato et al .",
    "( 2009 ) the superoutbursts in iy uma were detected in 2000 , 2002 , 2004 , 2006 and 2009 .",
    "nonetheless , the analysis of the bright spot of iy uma before , during and after the active state has not been made yet . observations of normal outbursts in eclipsing dns are also of great value , i.e. smak ( 1995 ) determined mass transfer rates in z cha and u gem based on extensive photometric coverage of the luminosity of the hot spot .",
    "rolfe et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed in iy uma the dramatic changes in the accretion flow and emission at the onset of an outburst .",
    "unfortunately , our data does not cover the beginning of the march 2012 outburst , also we did not collect any observations for a few successive normal outbursts .",
    "it is also worth noting the observations of iy uma during quiescence made by steeghs et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and reanalized by smak ( 2003 ) who noticed that about @xmath9 of the observed disk flux comes from parts of the stream which are overflowing the disk .",
    "stanishev et al .",
    "( 2000 ) conducted the eclipse mapping of iy uma during the late decline of the 2000 superoutburst and in quiescence stages and the strength of the orbital hump decreased by @xmath10 which further supports the idea that such a decrease could be produced by an enhanced mass transfer rate .    lately , there have been huge surveys dedicated for cvs ( kato et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 , 2012 , 2013 , 2014ab ) or the other projects where cvs are detected and observed when an opportunity arises , such as asas - sn ( davis et al .",
    "2015 ) or ogle surveys ( soszyski et al .",
    "2015 , mrz et al . 2013 , poleski et al . 2011 ) . eclipsing dns can be investigated with tools such as the eclipse mapping method ( horne 1985 ) or the decomposition method ( smak 1994a ) and that is why these objects are of great value of the future development of the theory of cvs .",
    "we present the analysis of the hot spot brightness in eclipsing dwarf nova iy uma before , during and after its normal outburst . in order",
    "to obtain separated light curves from the hot spot and from the disk , we used the decomposition method invented by smak ( 1994a ) . based on our data ,",
    "the hot spot amplitude changed significantly during the normal outburst . during quiescence , before and after the outburst , the average bright spot amplitude was above @xmath11 . during the march 2013 outburst in iy uma ,",
    "the brightness of the hot spot was below @xmath12 . in our opinion",
    ", the behaviour of the bright spot shows that iy uma during its normal outburst follows the dim model .",
    "after intense observations of iy uma at the beginning of this century , this eclipsing dn has received very little attention during last decade .",
    "iy uma is definitely worth observers attention .",
    "this star is an excellent accretion laboratory because of its high inclination , frequent outbursts and superoutbursts and brightness available for 1-meter class telescopes .",
