    "there is compelling evidence @xcite that as much as @xmath0 of the matter in the universe is under the form of dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "a set of very popular candidates for dm are wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) .",
    "this mostly follows from what is called the _ wimp miracle _ since cosmological data are consistent with a thermal relic cross section @xmath1 .",
    "wimps from the galactic halo can be accreted onto compact massive objects such as neutron stars ( ns ) @xcite or white dwarfs .",
    "the signature of wimp self - annihilations ( assuming wimps are majorana particles ) is energy release in the range equivalent to twice the wimp mass , leading to subsequent particle production and/or heating of the star .",
    "current predictions of the wimp mass span the range from m@xmath2 1 @xmath3 up to 10 @xmath4 however recent results from direct detection experiments dama and cogent seem to favour a light dm particle in the range 4 - 12 @xmath3 @xcite .    compact objects such as black holes or ns are considered to be gravitational accretors of dm .",
    "ns configurations , yielding gravitational mass , @xmath5 , and radius , @xmath6 , are computed using an equation of state ( eos ) that relates pressure to energy density and temperature , @xmath7 . a typical ns has a mass m@xmath8 1.4 m@xmath9 , radius @xmath10 km , surface temperature @xmath11kev and central mass density @xmath12 10@xmath13 g/@xmath14 .",
    "there is a variety of model predictions for ns composition @xcite but there is as yet no consensus about the fundamental nature of the matter in ns interiors .",
    "the accretion rate of wimps captured by a typical ns is given by @xcite @xmath15 assuming a wimp - nucleon interaction cross section @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "due to competing effects of annihilation and evaporation , the number of accreted wimps at time @xmath18 is obtained by solving the differential equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the self - annihilation rate calculated as @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the product of thermally - averaged wimp self - annihilation cross section and velocity , and @xmath23 , the number density of wimps inside the ns , is assumed to be constant .",
    "the evaporation rate , @xmath24 , decays exponentially with temperature @xmath25 , and is negligible with respect to the annihilation rate for ns with internal t @xmath26 0.1 mev @xcite . with this simplification",
    ", the population of wimps at time @xmath18 is given by @xmath27 where the time - scale is @xmath28 .",
    "for @xmath29 , when the equilibrium between accretion and annihilation has been reached , the number of particles accreted is time - independent , @xmath30 .    assuming a regime when velocities and positions of the wimps",
    "follow a maxwell - boltzmann distribution with respect to the centre of the ns , the thermalization volume in the compact star has a radius @xmath31 .",
    "taking typical ns conditions as central internal temperature @xmath32 k , @xmath33=10@xmath13 g/@xmath14 and m@xmath34 , r@xmath35 .",
    "then the thermalization volume is @xmath36 .",
    "the exact energy released due to wimp self - annihilation is dependent on the nature of wimps and on the output product channel .",
    "we parametrize this lack of knowledge by assuming a fraction of the annihilation energy is given by the efficiency factor , @xmath37 , typically @xmath38 .",
    "the rate of energy released in annihilation processes in the star in the thermal equilibrium volume can be expressed as @xcite , @xmath39 taking @xmath40=@xmath41 and an efficiency rate @xmath42 , we have that in the range @xmath43",
    "@xmath3 @xmath44 the energy released will convert partly into heat , which can stimulate @xmath45 quark bubble formation .",
    "thermal fluctuations may arise in metastable hadronic matter via strong interactions @xcite .",
    "the timing and conditions of these transitions depend strongly on the pressure in the central regions of the star given by the eos of hadronic matter .",
    "then @xmath46 matter undergoes non - leptonic weak reactions , such as @xmath47 , to form drops of strange @xmath48 matter , which has lower energy as a result of the reduction in fermi energies through the introduction of a new flavor . the stability , among other properties of these drops , commonly called _ strangelets _",
    ", has been extensively studied ( see e.g. @xcite ) and depends on the electrical charge , strangeness fraction and size .",
    "these exotic forms of matter are currently being searched with the castor in the lhc cms experiment in the forward rapidity and above earth attached to the iss with the ams spectrometer @xcite .",
    "the energy needed to form a stable long - lived strangelet of baryonic number @xmath49 can be calculated from its quark constituents , in a first approximation , using either the mit bag model with shell mode filling or the liquid drop model ( for details see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these calculations show that stability conditions point towards large negative electrical charge fractions and high strangeness . in the ideal fermi - gas approximation ,",
    "the binding energy of a strangelet with baryonic number @xmath49 composed of massive quarks of flavor @xmath50 @xmath51 is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the quark number in the strangelet of baryon number @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the quark chemical potential at baryonic number density @xmath56 . the thermodynamical potential for the @xmath57-quark type with mass @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 being @xmath60 the volume , @xmath61 the surface and @xmath62 the curvature of the spherical strangelet .",
    "expressions for these potentials can be obtained from @xcite .",
    "the masses of the quarks are taken as @xmath63 mev , @xmath64 mev , @xmath65 mev respectively . in order",
    "to consider charged strangelets a coulomb correction term can be added as @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 given the @xmath57-quark charge and number density , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "then , the energy of a strangelet with baryon number @xmath49 is @xmath71    estimation of the minimum value of @xmath49 in a long - lived strangelet is model - dependent but typical minimum @xmath49 values are in the range @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "strangelets with ` magic ' numbers of quarks are found for bag constant values @xmath73 mev . if smaller strangelets than the minimum @xmath49 are created , they will decay rapidly , however the long - lived ones have lifetimes of days . since this time - scale is larger than the conversion time - scale @xmath74 @xcite , it is in principle possible that strange stars could be formed if this conversion is triggered . as an estimate",
    "the rate of formation would be @xmath75 for @xmath42 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 @xmath3 , a number @xmath79 are created . assuming that in the center of the star , self - annihilations are dominant , the energy deposited in the medium , per annihilation , will be @xmath80 .",
    "this allows us to set a limit on the energy scale , at a given central baryonic density @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath82 we now discuss the results , a more detailed explanation can be found in @xcite .",
    "we have found that wimp mass shows a weak dependence on nuclear physics input , parameterized by @xmath83 . as the central baryon density increases , the lower limit on the wimp mass decreases below @xmath84 .",
    "we adopt @xmath85 as the highest value of the central baryon density , although recent pulsar masses constrain central densities to somewhat smaller values .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show the wimp mass to produce a long - lived strangelet as a function of @xmath49 for an efficiency rate @xmath42 and different values of the central density @xmath77 ( dash - dotted line ) , @xmath86 ( thick solid line ) , @xmath87 ( thin solid line ) for limiting values of the bag constant . for each pair of curves ,",
    "the lower line is for @xmath88 mev and the upper line is for @xmath89 mev . for a typical baryonic density of @xmath90 , a lower limit for the wimp mass @xmath91 @xmath3",
    "is predicted .      since the mass of the wimp sets a scale of the possible triggering of the strangelet formation we find that as more massive wimps annihilate , the smaller the efficiency rate becomes that is required to trigger a conversion from nucleon to strange quark matter . in summary , through the mechanism of self - annihilation of dm candidates in the central regions of a typical ns proposed in this work , we have derived a limit on the mass of dm particle candidate using the fact that there is a minimum long - lived strangelet mass needed to trigger a conversion from nuclear matter into strange quark matter . in the range @xmath94 @xmath95 the energy released in wimp self - annihilation is sufficient to burn nucleon matter into a long - lived strangelet that may trigger full conversion to a strange star .",
