    "chimera states represent an intriguing phenomenon in a dynamical network of coupled elements , which spontaneously separates into two coexisting domains with dramatically different behavior @xcite .",
    "they occur , surprisingly , in networks of identical units and symmetric coupling schemes @xcite . in spite of the fact that these symmetry - breaking states have been the subject of many investigations , e.g. , @xcite ,",
    "there still remain many issues to be addressed .",
    "a recent review on chimera states @xcite discusses a number of significant open questions concerning , for instance , the necessary conditions for their existence or generalizations of chimera states . a generalization to amplitude dynamics and to steady state coherence - incoherence patterns has been provided in @xcite .",
    "in particular , in @xcite it has been shown that chimeras of steady states appear due to a special symmetry - breaking coupling which originates from oscillation death investigations @xcite .",
    "oscillation death , i.e. , the stabilization of inhomogeneous steady states in coupled oscillator networks , appears when a homogeneous steady state splits into at least two distinct symmetry - breaking branches - upper and lower @xcite . in comparison with amplitude death , which is another type of oscillation suppression , i.e.",
    ", the stabilization of an unstable homogeneous steady state , oscillation death is much less investigated @xcite .",
    "initially found for phase oscillators @xcite , chimera states can be treated as long chaotic transients towards the in - phase synchronized regime . in this context",
    "the network size plays an essential role . in particular ,",
    "it has been shown theoretically @xcite and confirmed experimentally @xcite that the chimera lifetime grows exponentially with the system size .",
    "therefore , chimera states are stable for infinitely large networks and transient for finite - size ensembles .",
    "recently , in @xcite the question of what is the smallest possible number of oscillators allowing for chimera states has been addressed .",
    "another important problem , also considered as a necessary condition for the existence of chimera states , is the choice of initial conditions .",
    "random initial conditions do not always guarantee chimera behavior .",
    "this is due to the fact that classical chimera states typically coexist with the completely synchronized regime .",
    "the coexistence of two stable solutions is a signature of bistability which is typically associated with hysteresis .",
    "the basin of attraction for chimera states can be relatively small in comparison with that of the synchronized state .",
    "for that reason chimera states remained for a long time undetected .",
    "indeed , the first experimental studies @xcite on chimera states were provided only twelve years after their theoretical discovery .",
    "consequently , it is reasonable to use specially prepared initial conditions to ensure chimera patterns .",
    "however , it is worth noting that a chimera state is not just a temporary trace of initial conditions which disappears in time , but a persisting pattern with a long lifetime .    in the present work",
    "we investigate the connection between two symmetry - breaking effects : chimera states and oscillation death .",
    "we show that the interplay of nonlocal coupling topology and symmetry - breaking coupling leads to a number of novel partially coherent inhomogeneous spatial patterns , for instance amplitude chimeras and chimera death .",
    "additionally , we analyze the transition scenarios between these two patterns .",
    "moreover , the transient amplitude chimeras and the transition mechanism from amplitude chimera to a synchronized regime is investigated .",
    "further , the newly found amplitude chimeras are analyzed with respect to initial conditions and transients .",
    "in particular , we aim to understand the mechanism of transition from amplitude chimera to in - phase synchronization .",
    "finally , we address the question of how the lifetime of amplitude chimeras depends on initial conditions and what are the optimal initial distributions .",
    "we analyze the paradigmatic model of stuart - landau oscillators @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 . for @xmath3 , the uncoupled system exhibits self - sustained limit cycle oscillations with radius @xmath4 and frequency @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the stuart - landau system represents a generic model for nonlinear oscillators close to a hopf bifurcation .",
    "we investigate a ring of @xmath6 nonlocally coupled stuart - landau oscillators @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "the coupling parameters , which are identical for all links , are the coupling strength @xmath9 and the coupling range @xmath10 , where @xmath11 corresponds to the number of nearest neighbors in each direction on a ring . here",
    "we consider coupling only in the real parts , since this breaks the rotational @xmath12 symmetry of the system which is a necessary condition for the existence of nontrivial steady states @xmath13 and thus for oscillation death @xcite .",
    "with respect to applications this means that the oscillators are coupled only through a single real variable @xmath14 .",
    "if compared with slow - fast systems such as , for example , the fitzhugh - nagumo oscillator , which demonstrates two separated time scales , the stuart - landau oscillator is a generic model for sinusoidal oscillations which have only one characteristic time scale defined by the frequency @xmath5 .",
    "while tuning the coupling range @xmath11 for a fixed value of the coupling strength @xmath15 we uncover a variety of dynamical regimes in equation ( 2 ) which are shown as space - time plots , color - coded by the variable @xmath16 , and snapshots in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "in particular , we find chimera behavior with respect to amplitude dynamics , i.e. , amplitude chimeras @xcite , where one part of the network is oscillating with spatially coherent amplitude , while the other displays oscillations with spatially incoherent amplitudes ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a , f ) .",
    "it is important to note that within the incoherent domain of the amplitude chimera the center of mass of each oscillator @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the oscillation period , is shifted away from the origin , while the elements from the coherent subgroup oscillate around the origin . to illustrate this fact we calculate the distance between the center of mass of each oscillator and the origin @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2_new ] a ) .",
    "surprisingly , the shape of this profile is very similar to that of the mean phase velocity profile for the classical phase chimeras .",
    "however , for amplitude chimeras the mean phase velocity profile @xmath20 is flat ( fig . [ fig:2_new]b ) .",
    "this fact discloses the crucial feature of amplitude chimera : averaged phase velocities remain the same for every element of the network , since the phases are correlated even within the incoherent domain . in more detail , fig .",
    "[ fig:2_new]c shows the phase portraits of all oscillators in the complex @xmath21 plane clearly demonstrating the limit cycles with different amplitudes and centers of mass .",
    "the nodes from the coherent part oscillating with larger amplitudes around the origin perform fast motions in the complex @xmath22 phase plane , while the elements of the incoherent domain with smaller amplitudes are slowed down .",
    "therefore , the angular frequencies of all the nodes on average remain the same .",
    "consequently , we observe pure amplitude chimera - chimera behavior exclusively with respect to amplitude dynamics rather than the phase , in contrast to amplitude - mediated chimeras , for which both phase and amplitude are in a chimera state @xcite .",
    "the increase of the coupling range @xmath10 induces a transition from amplitude chimeras to an in - phase synchronized state ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]b , g ) . by increasing the coupling range",
    "even further we detect a novel pattern which provides bridging between chimera states and oscillation death .",
    "therefore , we call it _ chimera death _ @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]c - e , h - j ) . in this regime",
    "the oscillations die out in a peculiar way .",
    "the population of identical oscillators breaks up into two domains : ( i ) spatially coherent oscillation death , where the neighboring elements of the network are correlated forming a regular inhomogeneous steady state , and ( ii ) spatially incoherent oscillation death , where the sequence of populated branches of the inhomogeneous steady state of neighboring nodes is completely random .",
    "it is important to note that the term `` coherent / incoherent '' refers to the coherence / incoherence in space , i.e. , spatial correlation , which should be distinguished from temporal coherence which refers to correlations in time of the dynamics .",
    "because of symmetry reasons , for a node on the upper branch @xmath23 of the inhomogeneous steady state in the left half of the system , there always exists a mirror state shifted by phase @xmath24 ( anti - phase ) in the complex plane , i.e. , located on the lower branch @xmath25 , in the right half of the system .",
    "interestingly , the increase of the coupling range for fixed coupling strength also induces structural changes of the chimera death pattern : the coherent spatial domain may consist of one or several clusters where the nodes are on the same branch of the inhomogeneous steady state . with increasing coupling range the number of clusters in the coherent spatial domain is decreased ,",
    "see the scenario in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , from ( c , h ) ( 5 clusters ) via ( d , i ) ( 3 clusters ) to ( e , j ) ( 1 cluster ) .",
    "the illustration of the chimera death pattern with the maximum number of clusters in the coherent part is provided by fig .",
    "[ fig:3_new]a - c .",
    "the phase portrait typical for chimera death is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3_new]c , it consists of two fixed points shifted by a phase @xmath24 , corresponding to the two branches @xmath26 , @xmath26 of the inhomogeneous steady state .",
    "it should be noted that these two fixed points are very close to the centers of mass of those oscillations in fig .",
    "[ fig:2_new]c with the smallest amplitude , i.e. , in the center of the incoherent domain of the amplitude chimera .    to provide an overall view on the network behavior for the wide range of coupling parameters we plot the map of regimes in the plane of coupling range and coupling strength .",
    "the oscillatory behavior of the network is represented by amplitude chimeras ( blue region in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) , which are observed for small coupling range , and by in - phase synchronized oscillations ( light green region in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the steady state solutions occur for larger values of coupling parameters and are manifested by chimera death ( red regions in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] with different hatching ) .",
    "the region of chimera death is divided into several regimes depending on the number of coherent clusters .",
    "chimera death may consist of two coherent domains , which are formed by one cluster on the upper and one on the lower branch of the steady state ( dark and light red stripes in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the coherent regions may split into three clusters each ( dark red and yellow stripes in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) or more ( dark red in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "the typical space - time patterns and snapshots in panels ( c , d , e ) and ( h , i , j ) of fig [ fig:1 ] provide illustrations of the different multi - cluster chimera death states , and the corresponding coupling parameters are indicated in the phase diagram ( fig [ fig:2 ] ) by empty diamonds .",
    "it is important to note that the chimera death regime is characterized by high multistability .",
    "therefore , chimera death patterns with different number of clusters in the coherent part coexist .",
    "the map of regimes strongly depends on initial conditions , in particular , the borders between chimera death patterns with different number of clusters .",
    "however , the boundary separating the oscillatory regime from the steady state regimes ( with multiple cluster numbers ) appears to be less sensitive to initial conditions and remains almost the same for different realizations of initial conditions .",

    "[ fig:4]a and b , respectively , are indicated by two green vertical lines in the space - time plot of fig .",
    "[ fig:3]e . in the regime of amplitude chimera",
    "the node from the coherent part ( @xmath50 ) oscillates with large amplitude around the origin , while the two nodes in the incoherent domain ( @xmath51 ) oscillate with much smaller amplitudes around their own centers of mass shifted from the origin in two opposite directions ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4]a ) . during the transition",
    "the amplitudes of the incoherent oscillations grow till they reach the value of the coherent oscillations . at the same time the centers of mass for nodes from the incoherent domain move towards the origin ( fig . [",
    "fig:4]b ) .",
    "therefore , during the transition the phase trajectories for the nodes @xmath51 have spiral shapes ( fig . [ fig:4]b ) .",
    "an important observation is that the transition mechanism described above depends on the initial conditions .",
    "for example , asymmetric initial conditions may lead to another scenario which involves an asymmetric state . in this case",
    "nodes from the incoherent part join one by one their neighboring synchronized state .",
    "the first initial condition we choose originates from the oscillation death problem and is typically used for the inhomogeneous steady state @xcite .",
    "specifically , the system is divided into two equal domains : one is located on the upper branch and the other is on the lower branch . in our particular example of @xmath52 nodes this implies that one half of the network ( @xmath53 ) is on the upper branch @xmath23 while the other half is on the lower branch @xmath25 ( fig . [ fig:5]a ) . in this case",
    "the lifetime of amplitude chimeras is @xmath54 and decreases significantly when some small random shift from the branches is applied for every node .",
    "another type of initial condition we have tested is the modification of the previously discussed set by adding two incoherent regions , where the nodes are distributed randomly ( fig . [ fig:5]b ) .",
    "this leads to dramatically short lifetime ( @xmath55 ) of the amplitude chimera , which rapidly transforms into an in - phase synchronized state or a traveling wave .",
    "next we allow randomness in initial conditions for all nodes of the network , however , observing certain symmetries .",
    "in particular , in fig .",
    "[ fig:5]c the positions for @xmath56 of the nodes @xmath57 are chosen randomly around the upper branch , then these values are mirrored to the nodes @xmath58 by setting @xmath59 . finally , the positions of the other half of the nodes @xmath60 are obtained by applying a phase shift of @xmath24 which we call `` anti - phase partner '' condition : @xmath61 with @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath6 . the initial condition scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5]d is constructed in a similar way as in fig .",
    "[ fig:5]c .",
    "the only difference is that the values for the first @xmath57 nodes are chosen randomly around both branches of the inhomogeneous steady state ( and not only around the upper branch like in fig .",
    "[ fig:5]c ) .",
    "this amendment does not have any impact on the lifetime of amplitude chimeras , which is on the other hand strongly affected by the p resence of symmetries in the initial conditions .",
    "our simulations suggest that amplitude chimeras tend to have very short lifetime if in the incoherent domain the initial positions of nodes near the upper branch are uncorrelated with those close to the lower branch .",
    "an increase of the amplitude chimera lifetime can be achieved by introducing symmetries in the initial distribution ( `` anti - phase partner '' condition ) .",
    "therefore , optimal results with @xmath64 are obtained for random initial conditions with symmetries ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5]c , d ) . in conclusion",
    ", our numerical analysis shows that for random distributions without symmetries amplitude chimeras appear to be short transients towards in - phase synchronized regime , while symmetric conditions significantly increase their lifetime up to @xmath65 .",
    "moreover , random initial distributions may also lead to asymmetric spatio - temporal patterns .    to provide a comprehensive view on the impact of initial conditions",
    "we compare the map of regimes calculated for a specially prepared initial set ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) and for random initial conditions ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) . for the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we use as initial condition an amplitude chimera profile at a fixed time ( similar to fig .",
    "[ fig:3]c ) , which is obtained in the following way : for a fixed set of parameters in the amplitude chimera regime , the system is divided into two equal domains ; half of the nodes are located on the upper branch and the other half is on the lower branch of the inhomogeneous steady state ( similar to fig . [",
    "fig:5]a ) ; this initial condition then evolves into an amplitude chimera state which is used as initial condition for all other parameter values @xmath66 .",
    "the random initial distribution ( similar to fig . [ fig:5]d ) leads to a significantly different phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) in comparison with the specially prepared initial conditions ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the domain of the amplitude chimera is decreased for strong coupling if compared with fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "moreover , the regime of chimera death obtained from carefully chosen initial conditions ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) is replaced by the regime of incoherent oscillation death ( inset in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) which results from random initial conditions .",
    "it should be noted that the map of regimes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] is obtained for one single realization of random initial distribution and no averaging of initial conditions has been provided .",
    "therefore , it is not statistically representative that chimera death is not observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "this is merely due to the fact that the probability to achieve chimera patterns starting from one random realization of the initial conditio n is very low .",
    "however , the occurrence of chimeras for random initial conditions , in general , is not excluded .",
    "in conclusion , we have provided a connection between two symmetry - breaking effects - chimera states and oscillation death . in particular , we uncover new spatio - temporal patterns , i.e. , amplitude chimeras and chimera death .",
