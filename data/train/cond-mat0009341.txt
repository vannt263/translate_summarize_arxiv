    "an inorganic compound cugeo@xmath4 was discovered to undergo the spin - peierls ( sp ) transition at the critical temperature @xmath5 = 14 k in magnetic susceptibility measurements.@xcite in the sp transition , the formation of the superlattice occurs owing to the coupling between the one - dimensional spin system and three - dimensional phonon systems , together with the opening of a magnetic energy gap between the singlet ground state and the triplet excited state .",
    "the lattice dimerization was confirmed by electron diffraction,@xcite x - ray and neutron diffraction.@xcite the opening of the spin gap due to the sp transition was directly observed by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments.@xcite a phase transition from the dimerized ( d ) phase to the incommensurate ( ic ) phase was found at the critical field @xmath6 12 t.@xcite the incommensurate lattice modulation was observed in x - ray measurements under high magnetic field above @xmath2.@xcite higher order harmonics of the incommensurate bragg reflections were also observed just above @xmath2 , which indicates that the lattice modulation in the ic phase forms a soliton lattice.@xcite    one of the most important studies that the discovery of cugeo@xmath1 enables is that of impurity effects on the quasi - one - dimensional spin system . for small amounts of impurity ,",
    "another phase transition to the dimerized - antiferromagnetic ( daf ) phase was found at @xmath7 which is lower than @xmath5.@xcite in the daf phase , the coexistence of the lattice distortion and the antiferromagnetic ordering was found in neutron diffraction experiments.@xcite recently , masuda _ et al .",
    "_ found a first - order compositional phase transition between the daf and the uniform - antiferromagnetic ( uaf ) phases in mg - doped cugeo@xmath1.@xcite it is not clear whether this kind of the phase transition exists in si - doped cugeo@xmath1 or not but the sample with low concentration used in this paper has apparently the nature of daf phase below @xmath7.@xcite there are some reports about the nature of the high - field phase in doped cugeo@xmath1 with low concentration of impurities .",
    "namely , two phase transitions have been reported in specific heat experiments : one was the phase transition between uniform ( u ) and ic phases , and the other was a transition between the ic phase and the antiferromagnetically ordered incommensurate ( iaf ) phase.@xcite on the other hand , ultrasonic velocity measurements have suggested only one phase transition occurred above @xmath2.@xcite recently , the different behavior between the ic and iaf was reported on the thermal conductivity.@xcite the authors suggested that it is caused by the `` freezing \" of the solitons in the iaf phase .",
    "optical studies are quite sensitive for investigation of the change in crystal structure that is caused by a phase transition .",
    "factor group analysis predicts that nine infrared - active folded modes and 18 raman - active folded modes appear below @xmath5 in addition to optical phonons in the u phase , which occur when the symmetry of the crystal structure is lowered from pbmm of the u phase@xcite to bbcm of the d phase.@xcite three raman modes at 107 , 369 and 820 @xmath0 were assigned to the a@xmath8 folded phonons in the d phase,@xcite with the first one having a fano - type line shape.@xcite for the infrared - active folded phonons , one b@xmath9 , one b@xmath10 and two b@xmath11 modes were found at 98 , 284 , 312 and 800 @xmath0 , respectively.@xcite the field dependence of the folded phonon modes was investigated in raman experiments.@xcite the intensity decreases steeply at the boundary between the d and ic phases , while no energy shift is observed . just above @xmath2",
    ", the intensity decreases to about half that of the d phase , and continues to decrease in the ic phase with increasing field . the folded mode at 312 @xmath0 was observed above @xmath2 , but the details were unclear because it is located on the shoulder of an optical phonon.@xcite    in contrast to these results , in our previous paper,@xcite we have found a splitting of the folded phonon mode at 98 @xmath0 in the ic phase .",
    "the energy separation between the split - off branches is proportional to the incommensurability in the ic phase .",
    "it indicates that the incommensurability is closely related to the mechanism of splitting of the folded phonon in the ic phase . in the ic phase",
    ", the phonon modes at @xmath12 can be infrared active due to the incommensurate lattice modulation.@xcite we have explained this phenomenon as follows : the 98 @xmath0 phonon is a spin - phonon coupled mode .",
    "because of this the phonon mode at @xmath13 and that at @xmath14 can interact with each other through the spin component of 2@xmath15 of static incommensurate spin and lattice structure in the ic phase .",
    "the presence of 2@xmath15 spin component was recently confirmed firmly by nmr@xcite and neutron diffraction@xcite experiments .    in cugeo@xmath1 , soft mode has not been found yet and",
    "now it is believed that there is no soft mode . on the other hand , there should be spin - phonon coupled mode(s ) in cugeo@xmath1 , because there occurs spin - peierls transition in it .",
    "therefore , the finding of the spin - phonon coupled mode is very important for understanding various phenomena in cugeo@xmath1 .    in this paper , studies of the spin - phonon coupled modes near 98 @xmath0",
    "are extended to doped cugeo@xmath1 and the behaviors of these modes will be clarified in the d , ic , daf and iaf phases .",
    "doped cugeo@xmath4 single crystals were grown by a floating zone method using an image furnace and were cleaved along the ( 100 ) plane . the sample of cuge@xmath16si@xmath17o@xmath4 with dimensions of 1.5 @xmath18 4 @xmath18 6 mm@xmath19 was used in this study .",
    "it showed two phase transitions , u - d and d - daf , at low temperatures in zero field .",
    "far - infrared ( fir ) transmission was measured in the spectral range between 15 and 350 @xmath0 with a maximum resolution of 0.1 @xmath0 using a fourier transform spectrometer ( bomem da8 ) .",
    "the polarized measurements were performed in zero field by using fir polarizers .",
    "the unpolarized magneto - optical spectra were obtained with a superconducting magnet in the faraday configuration .",
    "the temperature dependence of the spectra was investigated down to 2 k. the spectra on the increasing ( decreasing ) field process were taken with a fixed field for several hours after increasing ( decreasing ) applied magnetic filed from lower ( higher ) field region .",
    "the doping effect of the folded mode at 98 @xmath0 was investigated on cuge@xmath16si@xmath17o@xmath4 in the d , ic , daf and iaf phases .",
    "the transmission spectra were normalized by the spectrum in the u phase , tr(_t _ = 17 k , _ b _ = 0 t ) , in order to clarify the small change between the u and other phases .",

    "[ fig1 ] shows the normalized transmission spectra , tr(@xmath20)/tr(@xmath20 = 17 k ) at @xmath21 = 0 t on the doped sample .",

    "the field dependence of fp , fp@xmath29 and fp@xmath30 on cugeo@xmath1 exhibits a hysteresis around @xmath2 .",
    "the presence of the hysteresis means that the transition between the d and ic phases is of the first order even in the doped sample and this corresponds to the fact that the hysteresis is also observed in pure cugeo@xmath1 in magnetization,@xcite magnetostriction@xcite and the incommensurability of the lattice modulation.@xcite the amounts of the hysteresis of fp@xmath29 and fp@xmath30 on both the pure and doped samples are about @xmath33@xmath35 0.2 t in the region of @xmath33@xmath36 3 @xmath0 , which were estimated by the difference between the magnetic fields where @xmath33@xmath34s are equal to each other on the increasing and decreasing field processes .",

    "the superlattice reflection peak was found to coexist with the antiferromagnetic peak and the intensity of the superlattice reflection decreases.@xcite the temperature dependence of the intensity of fp is fully consistent with that of the superlattice reflection because the intensity of the folded phonons is closely related to the magnitude of the lattice distortion caused by the dimerization due to the sp ordering .    above @xmath2",

    "the necessary conditions for splitting are not only the spin - phonon coupling but also the existence of the lattice modulation of @xmath45 and the component of the spin polarization with the periodicity of 2@xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the experimental results indicate the existence of the incommensurate modulation in the lattice and the spin polarization in both the ic and iaf phases .",
    "the incommensurate lattice modulation was observed in the ic and iaf phases on doped samples in the x - ray diffraction experiments.@xcite the behavior of the splitting different from the pure cugeo@xmath1 was found around @xmath2 .",

    "the positions of fp@xmath29 and fp@xmath30 in the ic and iaf phases of the doped sample gradually approach to those of the pure one with increasing field , which means that their field dependences can be well described by the same function at higher field range .    in our previous paper",
    ", it was shown that the field dependence of @xmath33@xmath34 can be scaled with that of the incommensurability , @xmath46 , and we concluded that @xmath33@xmath34 is proportional to the @xmath46 in the pure cugeo@xmath1.@xcite in order to clarify the difference between the pure and doped cugeo@xmath1 , @xmath33@xmath34s of the doped cugeo@xmath1 in the iaf and ic phases are plotted by scaling them with @xmath2 , as well as @xmath33@xmath34 of the pure cugeo@xmath1 and @xmath46 in the x - ray experiments , as shown in fig .",
    "the critical fields @xmath2 of the doped cugeo@xmath1 are determined to fit the field dependence of @xmath33@xmath34 into the fitting function , especially in the higher field range where the similarity to the pure cugeo@xmath1 was observed , because it is difficult to define correct @xmath2 of the doped cugeo@xmath1 owing to the wide coexistent region .",
    "the scale of the right - side ordinate for @xmath33@xmath34 is the same as that of the pure cugeo@xmath1 , which is adjusted to fit the field dependence of @xmath33@xmath34 to that of @xmath46 .",
    "the solid curve in fig .  [ fig4 ] is the fitting function @xmath47$].@xcite the dashed line indicates the theoretical prediction by cross for the high magnetic field limit.@xcite figure  [ fig4 ] indicates that @xmath33@xmath34 of the doped cugeo@xmath1 deviates from the fitting function in the iaf and ic phases in the lower field range of @xmath48 1.03 , and are observed even at @xmath48 1 , while they can be plotted quite well on the same universal curve as that of the pure one at higher field region of @xmath49 1.03 .",
    "the discrepancy increases with decreasing @xmath33@xmath34 around @xmath2 .",
    "a similar behavior can be seen on @xmath46 of the doped cugeo@xmath1 , especially , with higher concentration of impurities,@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in the iaf phase ,",
    "the discrepancy is larger than that in the ic phase on the doped cugeo@xmath1 , and @xmath33@xmath34 in the iaf survives at the lower field in @xmath50 scale .",
    "this result indicates that @xmath33@xmath34 and @xmath46 are no longer described by the fitting function at this field range .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that the relation @xmath51 is broken in this region because @xmath31 and @xmath46 were measured on different samples . in higher field region of @xmath49 1.03 ,",
    "@xmath46 is well described by the same theoretical fitting function on both pure and doped cugeo@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the proportional relation of @xmath33@xmath52 may be valid even on the doped cugeo@xmath1 at @xmath49 1.03 .",
    "we assumed that the strength of the coupling is proportional to the density of the solitons with periodicity 2@xmath15 , i.e. , the integrated intensity of the average component of the spin polarization of 2@xmath15.@xcite consequently , @xmath33@xmath34 is determined only by the incommensurability , @xmath46 , and is independent of the species of the impurities or the mechanism of how the local magnetization is induced around the impurities.@xcite @xmath33@xmath34 approaches gradually the curve predicted by the theory of cross with increasing field , and seems to approach the theory of cross above @xmath53 .",
    "in the field range of @xmath54 , the field dependence of the magnetization@xcite and the spontaneous strain@xcite can be fitted by a linear function and the lattice modulation is well described as sinusoidal.@xcite the discrepancy between the pure and doped cugeo@xmath1 around @xmath2 can be explained by the presence of interaction between the solitons and the impurities , as follows .",
    "the interaction between the solitons and the impurities must exist on the doped cugeo@xmath1 , and binding of the solitons on the impurities can occur.@xcite they change the distribution of intersoliton distance , and induces randomness in it .",
    "the effect of the interaction is enhanced on the condition that the number of solitons is of the same order as that of the impurities , and is weakened with increasing soliton numbers as compared with the impurity numbers .",
    "therefore , in higher field region , the effect of this interaction is weak and @xmath33@xmath34 and @xmath46 exhibit almost the same field dependence as that of the pure cugeo@xmath1 . on the other hand , around @xmath2 , the effect of the interaction is no longer negligible , and the randomness prevents @xmath2 from being well - defined , which makes the field dependence of @xmath33@xmath34 weaker .",
    "the different behavior of @xmath33@xmath34 between the iaf and ic phases indicates that the impurity effect in the iaf phase is stronger than that in the ic phase .",
    "this is consistent with the model of the `` freezing `` of the solitons in the iaf phase.@xcite the observation of the remnant signals in the iaf phase would be also related with the `` freezing '' of the solitons .",
    "interestingly , the interaction between the solitons and the impurities , or `` freezing \" of the solitons , do not affect the hysteresis of fp@xmath30 and fp@xmath29 .",
    "the reduction of the shift of fp in the vicinity of @xmath2 might be connected with this interaction if , as we believe , the shift of fp is caused by the discommensuration which appears just above @xmath2 .",
    "we have performed the doping effect of the folded phonon mode at 98 @xmath0 on the si - doped cugeo@xmath1 . the folded phonon mode was observed in both the d and daf phases , and the splitting of the mode was observed in the ic and the iaf phases .",
    "this definitely proves that ic phase exists in the region of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which is consistent with the reports of refs .   and .",
    "the different behavior of the split - off branches from the pure cugeo@xmath4 was observed in the vicinity of @xmath2 , and the discrepancy in the iaf phase is larger than that in the ic phase .",
