    "the dilepton spectrometer hades is currently being built at the heavy - ion synchrotron sis at gsi darmstadt@xcite .",
    "hades will measure dielectron pairs emitted in relativistic heavy - ion collisions in the beam energy range of 1 - 2 agev .",
    "additionally , a secondary pion beam facility of momenta between 0.5 gev / c and 2.5 gev / c will allow the measurements of dilepton observables in pion induced reactions@xcite .",
    "measurements of in - medium dielectron decays of the vector mesons @xmath0 and @xmath1 allow to reconstruct in - medium masses of these vector mesons .",
    "hence , experiments with hades will test a series of conjectures about in - medium behavior of vector mesons in hot and dense matter produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions@xcite .",
    "the hades spectrometer consists of a superconducting toroidal magnet with six sectors of 60@xmath2 azimuthal angle each .",
    "the acceptance in polar angle extends from 18@xmath2 to 85@xmath2 in the forward hemisphere .",
    "multiwire drift chambers ( mdcs ) placed forward of and behind the magnetic field are used for trajectory reconstruction of the individual particles . between the target and magnetic field region , a ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich )",
    "identifies electron trajectories with a threshold @xmath3 20 . in the region behind the magnetic field , a second , independent electron identification is achieved by a multiplicity / electron trigger array ( meta ) .",
    "the meta system consists of time of flight ( tof ) paddles and shower detectors@xcite .",
    "hades is designed to operate at heavy - ion beam intensities of 10@xmath4 particles per second .",
    "a 1% interaction target results in 10@xmath5 minimum bias events per second",
    ". the multi - level trigger system of hades has to reduce this primary rate to a few hundred events per second which will be written onto tape .",
    "the first level trigger is designed to select central collisions by recognizing events with a large charged particle multiplicity .",
    "the expected rate of the first level trigger is 10@xmath6 events per second .",
    "the second level trigger searches for lepton candidates by matching the identified rich rings with the measured meta showers .",
    "this matching procedure is based on the angular correlations of physical tracks in the rich and meta detectors .",
    "the third level trigger combines the output of the matching unit with the tracking information from the mdcs .",
    "this trigger stage rejects mainly combinations of low energy electrons producing a rich ring with hadrons misidentified as leptons in the meta system .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present simulation studies of the hades first level trigger in heavy - ion induced reactions .",
    "simulation results are shown for the systems au+au at 1 agev and ne+ne at 2 agev , in order to illustrate the trigger performance in a heavy and a light collision system , respectively .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : ftrig ] gives a summary on the hades first level trigger requirements . in section [ sec : pdat ] , the simulation of the first level trigger data is described .",
    "section [ sec : adat ] introduces the analysis of the simulation data . in section [ sec : fauau ] , the performance characteristics of the first level trigger in the heavy system au+au is presented .",
    "section [ sec : fnene ] gives details of the first level trigger performance in the light system ne+ne .",
    "the hades first level trigger will tag central heavy - ion reactions by recognizing events with a large charged particle multiplicity .",
    "this multiplicity can be derived from the highly segmented tof array",
    ". a lower limit on the number of tof paddles carrying a signal will select central events .",
    "an optimal first level trigger accepts all central events while suppressing non - central events as much as possible .",
    "comprehensive dilepton spectroscopy of heavy - ion reactions , however , necessitates additionally the measurement of the dielectron signal in non - central events . with the same first level trigger approach",
    "as described below , data of non - central events can be taken by redefining the multiplicity conditions and by appropriately downscaling the resulting trigger rate .",
    "thus , non - central events can either be downscaled and be registered simultaneously with central events or can be recorded in dedicated data taking periods .",
    "the trigger signal derived from the multiplicity conditions of the tof paddles is used as gate for the adcs of the rich detector and as common stop for the tdcs .",
    "hence the delay of this signal with respect to the time of reaction as well as the time jitter are of particular interest .",
    "the time jitter of the first level trigger signal arises from different sources .",
    "first , trajectory length variations over the polar angular range of the spectrometer induce particle time of flight variations .",
    "second , velocity variations of the particles defining the trigger transition add to the time of flight variations .",
    "third , the different signal propagations in the tof paddles depending on location of the hit point add varying delays to the tof signals .",
    "each signal of the first level trigger has an associated deadtime due to frontend readout of detectors .",
    "this deadtime is about 10 @xmath7sec .",
    "if the multiplicity condition is set low , then the trigger rate will be increased with a corresponding increase in probability that central events fall into the deadtime window .",
    "if , on the other hand , the multiplicity condition is set high , then central events start to get rejected due to insufficient multiplicity . for a given deadtime , there exists therefore a multiplicity condition which optimizes the number of central events which are passed onto the next trigger stage .",
    "due to the statistical occurrence of heavy - ion reactions , there is a finite probability that two or more events occur very close in time .",
    "hence , tof paddles can carry simultaneously signals of different events .",
    "the combined signals of the different events may satisfy the trigger condition whereas none of the individual events would be able to do so .",
    "this overlap probability depends strongly on the reaction rate and , thus , on beam intensity . for all of the results shown ,",
    "a beam rate of 10@xmath4 per second and a minimum bias event rate of 10@xmath5 per second is assumed .",
    "the performance of the first level trigger in heavy - ion collisions depends weakly on the duration of the tof paddle signals@xcite .",
    "if the tof signal length is short , the signals from the fastest particles will have disappeared , while the signals from the slower particles of the event have not started yet .",
    "the trigger system will therefore see an apparently reduced event multiplicity .",
    "tof signals which are long , on the other hand , result in an increased number of triggers from events overlapping in time . in this report , all the results shown have been derived with a tof signal duration of 15 nsec .",
    "for studying the behavior of the first level trigger , the full hades geometry was implemented into the geant package@xcite .",
    "a realistic field map of the toroidal magnetic field is used for tracking of the charged particles .",
    "the collisions of the two systems studied au+au and ne+ne are modeled by a transport equation of the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) type .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the collisions is determined by calculating the phase space evolution for nucleons , delta and n@xmath8 resonances . with this code , good agreement is found between data and model predictions for nucleon , pion , kaon and dilepton distributions in heavy - ion collisions in the energy range 1 - 2 agev@xcite .",
    "since the charged particle multiplicity in central collisions is mainly due to protons and pions , only these two particle species are tracked for the first level trigger simulations .",
    "for the simulations of the first level trigger in the systems au+au and ne+ne , buu events of different impact parameters are used . in these systems , the upper limit of the impact parameter range is defined by the geometrical cross section . in each of the two systems studied , six to eight discrete equidistant impact parameters represent the full range from zero to maximum value .",
    "each tracked particle of an event is followed through the complete hades geometry .",
    "a trajectory entering a tof paddle volume defines a tof hit .",
    "the information of this hit contains the tof paddle number and a time value .",
    "this time value represents the sum of the particles time of flight from target to the paddle hit point plus the shorter of the two propagation delays of the signal to either end of the paddle . here ,",
    "no finite resolution or signal time jitter is assumed . this exact time value is then converted into an integer format with a discretization accuracy of 10 psec and subsequently written into a cern cwn - tupel . at this stage , each discrete impact parameter is simulated separately .",
    "hence , separate tupel files exist for each of the discrete impact parameters simulated .",
    "in the analysis of the first level trigger , a stream of events is generated by assigning a random time interval t@xmath9 and a random impact parameter b to each event .",
    "the time interval t@xmath9 is chosen according to the probability @xmath10 .",
    "this probability distribution represents the distribution of time intervals between two consecutive events , with @xmath11 being equal to the inverse of the average time between two consecutive events .",
    "the absolute time of an event is determined by adding t@xmath9 to the absolute time of the previous event .",
    "the impact parameter b of an event is taken from a distribution which is zero at b=0fm and linearly increasing up to b = b@xmath12 . here , b@xmath12 is defined by the geometrical cross section as explained above .",
    "an event is subsequently read from the tupel file with the closest nearby simulated impact parameter .",
    "the analysis of the first level trigger loops over all tof paddles in time steps of 1 nsec . in each loop ,",
    "the sum of the tof paddles carrying a signal at that particular moment is calculated . if the given trigger multiplicity requirement is met in a step , but not in the previous one , then a trigger transition is induced . in the prompt trigger described below ,",
    "a trigger transition generates a trigger . in the delayed trigger described below",
    ", a trigger transition initiates a time window of 20 nsec during which the event has to satisfy an additional multiplicity requirement .",
    "if this additional condition is met , then a trigger is generated . here ,",
    "prompt and delayed trigger refer to the one and two step trigger approach as described in section [ ssec : fmt ] .",
    "each trigger starts a deadtime window during which no other triggers are accepted .",
    "in the high multiplicity heavy - ion system au+au , a multiplicity condition in each azimuthal sector will tag central events .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows the tagging efficiency for this system as a function of the imposed sector multiplicity condition m@xmath13 .",
    "this condition implies that the charged particle multiplicity is greater or equal to m@xmath13 in each of the six azimuthal sectors . shown",

    "for all the impact parameters shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , the efficiency exhibits a plateau of nearly 100% at low sector multiplicity values but drops steeply at large multiplicity values .",
    "the optimal choice for the sector multiplicity condition is a value as large as possible but still within the plateau of the impact parameter b=1fm .",
    "hence , the sector multiplicity condition is set to m@xmath14 for the calculations shown below .",
    "events satisfying the sector multiplicity condition m@xmath13 generate a trigger transition .",
    "the delay of this signal relative to the time of reaction and the signal jitter are of interest .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] shows the timing of the trigger transition for events with different impact parameters .",
    "central events are represented by the solid line .",
    "the fwhm of their time distribution amounts to about 2 nsec .",
    "the fwhm value for events with impact parameters of 3 and 5 fm are about 4 and 6 nsec , respectively .",
    "semi - central events meet the trigger condition only with the help of slower moving particles . hence , for increasing impact parameters , a shift of the centroid to larger time values as well as a broadening of the distribution is seen .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] is the time of reaction .",
    "the sector multiplicity requirement defines a condition on minimum particle multiplicity in each of the six azimuthal sectors .",
    "a condition on minimum total multiplicity might further reduce non - central events while at the same time accepting all central events . at the moment of the trigger transition",
    ", the total multiplicity for central events is still building up , whereas it is almost exhausted for non - central events .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] displays the maximum total multiplicity reached during a time window of 20 nsec following the trigger transition .",
