    "the theory of parallel queues is a distinguished area of queueing theory .",
    "parallel queues have good properties ( e.g. halfin @xcite , mitzenmacher @xcite , winston @xcite ) resulting in various applications in different areas of science and technology .",
    "the literature on parallel queues is very rich and includes solutions of a large number of various theoretical and applied problems . in this context",
    "we mention the pioneering paper of flatto and mckean @xcite , the papers of flatto @xcite , flatto and hahn @xcite , as well as the recent paper of kurkova and suhov @xcite for mentioning a few .    during the last years",
    "there has been increasing interest in parallel queueing systems due to a growing development of telecommunication technologies . as a result",
    ", there has been substantially increasing number of related publications including such areas as routing and admission control problems , scheduling and many other areas using the join - the - shortest - queue ( js - queue ) policy .    despite of many existing publications on js - queue models , it is still not a well - studied area . there is a large number of unsolved problems or problems the solution of which is very far from its completion .",
    "one of them is a problem of stability .",
    "the stability ( instability ) of different js - queue ( together with stability other closely related models ) has been studied in many papers .",
    "we refer to the papers of foley and mcdonald @xcite , foss and chernova @xcite , @xcite , kurkova @xcite , sharifnia @xcite , suhov and vvedenskaya @xcite , tandra , hemachandra and manjunath @xcite , vvedenskaya and suhov @xcite , and vvedenskaya , dobrushin and karpelevich @xcite .",
    "particularly , the stability of a markovian load - balanced network , consisting of two stations only , has been studied in @xcite .    in the present paper , we establish necessary and sufficient conditions of stability for a wide class of load - balanced networks , the arrival and departure processes of which are assumed to be quite general .",
    "the exact description of these processes will be provided later in the paper .",
    "the stability of stochastic processes and especially queueing systems and networks of queues is a very significant area of research .",
    "the first results on the stability of queues go back to the well - known pioneering papers of lindley @xcite and kiefer and wolfowitz @xcite on the stability of classic single - server and multiserver queueing systems .",
    "one of the most significant contribution to stability of queueing systems was made slightly later by loynes @xcite , who was the first person to establish the stability of single - server queues with dependent interarrival and service times .",
    "the approach of loynes @xcite is well - known and has been widely used to prove the stability of various queueing systems .",
    "it led to a new vision of the stability for models with _ dependent _ interarrival and/or service times , and has been a source for new methods of the stability of complex queueing models . among them",
    "there are renovative theory and recurrence equation methods ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and many others ) as well as a martingale - based approach of @xcite .    however , the development of the loynes approach towards queueing networks , because of their complicated nature , has been problematical , and the proof of the stability and ergodicity of queueing networks is typically based on other methods based on the special theories of markov and regeneration processes .",
    "the first results on the stability of jackson - type queueing networks have been obtained by borovkov @xcite , @xcite .",
    "then the stability and ergodicity of networks have been studied in many papers .",
    "we mention the papers related to the stability of jackson - type networks by meyn and down @xcite , kaspi and mandelbaum @xcite , @xcite , sigman @xcite and baccelli and foss @xcite .",
    "all of these papers , but @xcite , are based on regeneration phenomena of the theory of harris recurrent markov chains .",
    "the theory of harris recurrent markov chains had been exposed in the books of orey @xcite and revuz @xcite .",
    "the detailed study of stochastic stability of markov chains and the theory of harris recurrent markov processes can be found in the book of meyn and tweedie @xcite , and in a number of research papers of these authors @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    however , the proof of networks stability by the means of harris recurrent markov chains is restrictive .",
    "being very difficult technically , it works in the cases where the sequences of interarrival and service times consist of independent random variables . in this case the phase space of the process can be expanded to markov , and a network stability is proved in terms of the stability of the corresponding markov process . as a rule",
    "the proof of the network stability in this case requires specific additional conditions .",
    "for example , in most of papers an infinite support of interarrival time distributions is required .",
    "sometimes some additional method based technical conditions are required as well ( e.g. see dai @xcite ) .",
    "baccelli and foss @xcite proved the stability of jackson - type networks with dependent interarrival and service times .",
    "their proof is based on development of renovation theory .",
    "however , the mentioned paper is about 70 pages long , it contain many notions and results from different areas of research ( stochastic petri nets for example ) , and it is not easy to read this paper .    in the present paper ,",
    "we establish conditions for stability of js - queue models including load balanced networks .",
    "the class of load - balanced networks is wider that the class of jackson - type networks , so the stability results of the present paper are more general than those for jackson - type networks . on the other hand ,",
    "our method is a loynes - based method , and our stability results are established for quite general networks with sequences of _ dependent _ interarrival and service times , and these sequences can be dependent of one another as well .",
    "furthermore , for the known cases of queues and networks our results are obtained under weaker conditions than known results .",
    "for example , the paper of baccelli and foss @xcite requires stationarity of the appropriate sequences of interarrival and service times . in our case",
    ", we requires weaker conditions of the strong law of large numbers , and our class of systems is therefore wider .",
    "our challenge is as follows .",
    "we first establish the following equivalence : _ the stability of usual queueing systems follows from the stability of queueing systems with autonomous service mechanism _ ( which are sometimes called queueing systems with a walking type service @xcite ) .",
    "this result is based on sample path analysis and stochastic comparison , and although its proof is elementary , the result is a significant contribution to the proof of the stability of different queueing networks .",
    "sample - path analysis for stability of queueing systems and networks is not new ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the approach of the present paper specifically uses a sample - path analysis in combination with other methods and based on the new idea of reduction of the original problem to another not traditional simpler problem .",
    "the aforementioned stochastic inequalities established for queueing systems is easily extended to each node of a network , where a stable behavior of each node of a usual network is a consequence of the stable behavior of the corresponding node of the queueing network with autonomous service mechanism .",
    "then the general problem reduces to the easier problem of the stability of networks with autonomous service , and the second part of the proof is _ to establish the stability of queueing networks with an autonomous service mechanism_. this second part of the proof is based on the loynes method .    queueing",
    "systems with an autonomous service mechanism have been introduced and initially studied by borovkov @xcite , @xcite , and then have been an object of study in a large number of papers ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in traditional applications ,",
    "queueing systems with autonomous service are associated with a shuttle bus picking up passengers from stations .",
    "other , more interesting applications of these systems , are known from computer technologies .",
    "one of such examples is the event processing in the operating system microsoft windows .",
    "the details of this issue can be found in @xcite in section 10 : threads synchronization and specifically on page 396 ( events ) .",
    "the original construction there is much more complicated than that in our example described below , and it is explained in terms of threads and their synchronization which is required in the windows programming .",
    "however , loosely speaking , it can be explained as follows . in specified time instants , the event processor checks whether there is an event ( such as mouse - movement , mouse - click , mouse - double - click and so on ) in the event queue .",
    "if such an event exists ( there is a thread receiving an acknowledgement ( signal ) about it ) , then the system processes it at specified time instant .",
    "otherwise , the system continues to check the state of the event queue .",
    "the idea of reducing one stability problem of a complex network to another corresponding stability problem of a network with simpler / concise properties is not new .",
    "there are special criteria in the literature allowing to replace an original ( stochastic ) network by its ( deterministic ) fluid model to study the stability . such criteria for quite general class of queueing networks with multiple customer classes has been established by dai @xcite .",
    "formally it had been used before for establishing the instability of a special configuration of a network with priority classes by rybko and stolyar @xcite .",
    "although the reducing an original stochastic network to its deterministic fluid analogue looks natural , in fact it requires additional ( mild ) conditions . in the case of our study by reducing an original stochastic network to its associated stochastic network with autonomous service mechanism no additional condition is required .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the main js - queue models , which will be then developed and modified in the following sections .",
    "( the material of the paper is presented in the order of increasing complexity . ) in the same section we give all of the necessary definitions related to stability of queues and networks . in section 3",
    "we prove the correspondence between the stability of the original queueing system and that of the associated queueing system with an autonomous service mechanism .",
    "the proof is based on sample path analysis . in section 4",
    "we establish conditions for stability of js - queue models of queueing systems , and then in section 5 we establish conditions for stability of load - balanced networks . in section 6",
    "we conclude the paper , where the stability of more general networks , than those studied here , with batch arrival and service times are discussed .",
    "in this section we describe main js - queue models with an autonomous service mechanism . these models and",
    "some of the assumptions related to the arrival and departure processes will be then modified in the following sections .",

    "then , @xmath8 .",
    "the process @xmath3 is defined analogously .",
    "we have the sequence of positive random variables @xmath9 , and the sequence of points @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . then , @xmath12 . we assume @xmath13 and @xmath14 the process @xmath2 forms a _ dedicated _ traffic , while the process @xmath3 forms an _ opportunistic _ traffic .",
    "@xmath0 a customer arriving at moment @xmath15 , @xmath16 , is assigned to the @xmath17th queue , @xmath18 , with the probability @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , residing there to wait for the service .",
    "@xmath0 a customer , arriving at moment @xmath21 , @xmath16 , is assigned to the queue with the shortest queue - length breaking ties at random .",
    "@xmath0 the departure process from the @xmath17th server is governed by the point process @xmath22 .",
    "specifically , the @xmath23th service time of the @xmath17th server is denoted @xmath24 , and the corresponding sequence of points is denoted @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "we assume @xmath29 @xmath0 for our convenience we assume that the processes @xmath2 , @xmath30 and @xmath22 , @xmath18 , all are mutually independent point processes .",
    "( then this condition together with other conditions , and will be relaxed . )",
    "@xmath0 the service mechanism of each server is assumed to be autonomous .",
    "this means the following .",
    "let @xmath31 denote the number of customers in the @xmath17th queue at time @xmath32 , @xmath18 , and let @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the thinning of the processes @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are arrival processes to the @xmath17th queue .",
    "then , @xmath36 for the further convenience the above model is denoted @xmath37 , where the subscript @xmath1 denotes the number of parallel queues .",
    "the model @xmath37 is a special case of the more general model , in which it is assumed that there are @xmath1 different arrival point processes @xmath38 , @xmath39 ,  , @xmath40 of dedicated traffic corresponding to @xmath1 servers .",
    "let us denote this more general model @xmath41 .    in turn , we will also consider the particular case of the model @xmath37 , where @xmath42 in this case the families @xmath43 and @xmath44 consist of identically distributed processes .",

    "for the sake of convenience we discuss definitions for @xmath37 models .",
    "the extension of this definition to models @xmath41 is technical .",
    "the above equation for model @xmath37 is given for all @xmath46 .",
    "for our purpose we extend this equation , assuming that all the processes start at @xmath47 .",
    "then , instead of we have the following equation : @xmath48 where the subscript @xmath47 says that the processes start at @xmath47 .",
    "[ defn2 ] the system @xmath37 is called to be instable if @xmath49 for any bounded set @xmath50 at least for some index @xmath51 and any @xmath32 .",

    "assume that an arriving customer of the dedicated traffic occupies the server @xmath17 with probability @xmath204  ( @xmath18 ) , and @xmath20 .",
    "after his service completion in the @xmath17th queue , a customer leaves the system with probability @xmath205 , remains at the same @xmath17th queue with probability @xmath206 , goes to the different queue @xmath207 with probability @xmath208 , and choose the shortest queue with probability @xmath209 , breaking ties at random .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath210 at least for one of the indexes @xmath17 .",
    "this model is called _ load - balanced network_. the stability conditions of the markovian variant of this network containing two stations only has been established by kurkova @xcite .    some different variants of this network have also been studied in martin and suhov @xcite , vvedenskaya dobrushin and karpelevich @xcite and other papers",
    ".    denote @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 .    for the sake of simplification of the proofs , we follow the assumptions that are described in section 2 , with understanding that they can be relaxed by the way of the previous section .",
    "we also assume that the processes all are started at @xmath47 and use the variants of the assumptions where @xmath155 rather than @xmath214 .",
    "the sufficient condition given in theorem [ thm3 ] is a straightforward extension of earlier theorem [ thm2 ] written now in a simpler form .",
    "[ thm3 ] assume that @xmath215 for all @xmath216 .",

    "the value @xmath249 is the fraction of time when the server of the @xmath226th queue is busy .",

    "the total sum of rates of dedicated traffic of the @xmath17th queue consists of exogenous and internal arrivals to that @xmath17th queue , excluding the rates for joining the shortest queue customers .",
    "since the rates associated with opportunistic traffic are excluded , there is the inequality @xmath254 between the left and right sides .",
    "thus , if the @xmath17th queue is never shortest , then the sum of the rates of the left - hand side divided to @xmath253 becomes equal to @xmath157 of the right - hand side .",
    "when the traffic parameter @xmath253 is greater than 1 , the @xmath17th queue increases to infinity with probability 1 .",
    "therefore , in the sequel we only consider the case when @xmath255 for all @xmath18 . in this case @xmath256 , and we therefore have @xmath257    let us now write a so - called _ balance equation _",
    ", taking into account also joining the shortest queue customers .",
    "we have @xmath258 now , we are ready to prove the _ improved _ sufficient condition for the stability . this version is also based on a straightforward extension of theorem [ thm2 ] .",

    "@xmath265 the @xmath196-th queue is never shortest , and therefore , following the proof of theorem [ thm2 ] , the system is stable if @xmath266 .",
    "therefore from we have @xmath267 , and because the @xmath196-th queue is the longest queue , we have @xmath268 , @xmath18 .",
    "therefore @xmath269 for all @xmath18 is a sufficient condition of stability for this case .",
    "let us now consider the opposite case , where @xmath270 . as in the proof of theorem [ thm2 ] ,",
    "in this case the arrival rate to all @xmath1 queues is the same , and therefore @xmath271 .",
    "thus , the only two cases are there as @xmath269 or @xmath272 for all @xmath273 . in the case",
    "@xmath269 , the stability result is analogous to that of theorem [ thm2 ] , since in this case from we obtain @xmath274 the theorem is proved .    now in order to formulate and prove a necessary and sufficient condition for stability , let us consider the following linear programming problem in @xmath275 : @xmath276 subject to the restrictions : @xmath277@xmath278@xmath279    observe , that the restrictions and correspond to and , where the values @xmath280 are replaced with unknown @xmath281 .",

    "@xmath283 is an additional variable ; thus the linear programming - is a mini - max problem .",
    "that is , if the minimum of @xmath283 is achieved in some point @xmath284 , then all components of the vector ( @xmath285 ) associated with this solution are less than 1 , and there exists a solution of system and with @xmath269 for all @xmath18 .",
    "therefore in the following the vector associated with solution of the problem - is denoted ( @xmath286 ) .",
    "otherwise if @xmath287 , then we set @xmath272 , @xmath18 .",

    "each arrival of the initial process @xmath152 is forwarded to the queue @xmath17 with probability @xmath19 , and each customer served in the queue @xmath226 returns to the @xmath17th queue with probability @xmath225 .",
    "then , the process @xmath288 is a sum of all arrivals of external and internal dedicated traffic , and @xmath289 where @xmath280 , @xmath18 , are a solution of the linear programming given by - .",
    "now let @xmath213 .",

    "then the load - balanced network is stable if and only if @xmath295 .    [ rem5 - 1 ] conditions and are verifiable conditions .",
    "as soon as the linear programming problem is solved and we know the vector of solution @xmath296 , the unknown processes @xmath297 and @xmath298 as well as @xmath299 and @xmath300 can be easily modelled via derivative processes @xmath138 ( @xmath18 ) . note also , that above conditions and are automatically fulfilled if @xmath301 .",
    "[ rem5 - 2 ] in the case of the network associated with the model @xmath41 the following additional comment is necessary .",
    "if the value @xmath196 is not unique , then condition should be assumed for all of these values @xmath196 .",
    "in this paper we established stability of different type joint - the - shortest - queue models including load - balanced networks .",
    "the statements of stability are established under quite general assumptions on arrival and departure processes by reduction to the corresponding models with autonomous service mechanism .",
    "now we discuss how these results can be extended to the models of queues and networks allowing batch arrivals and batch departures . for this purpose , consider the queueing system with batch arrivals and departures and autonomous service .",
    "for this queueing system let @xmath302 denote arrival process and let @xmath303 departure process , both marked point processes .",
    "( all of the processes considered in this section are assumed to start at zero . ) for the sake of simplicity suppose that the marks of the point process @xmath303 all are of the constant size @xmath304 ( @xmath304 is a positive integer number ) , and therefore @xmath305 .",
    "then , the queue - length process @xmath306 has the following representation ( see @xcite ) : @xmath307 it was shown in @xcite that by using skorokhod s reflection principle we arrive at equation @xmath308-\\inf_{s\\leq t}[\\mathscr{a}(s)-\\mathscr{d}(s)],\\ ] ] which is similar to that of the process with ordinary departures .",
    "the assumption , that the marks of departure process are a constant @xmath304 , is specific and associated with concrete models considered in @xcite .",
    "representation remains in force in general , when a departure process is an arbitrary marked point process with mutually independent identically distributed marks .",
    "representation is easily generalized to the case of js - queue models .",
    "specifically , for the queue - length process in the @xmath17th server of the model @xmath309 we have the similar equation @xmath310\\\\ & \\ \\ \\",
    "-\\inf_{s\\leq t}[\\mathscr{a}^{(j)}(s)+\\mathscr{a}^{\\prime(j)}(t)-\\mathscr{d}^{(j)}(s ) ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath311 is the corresponding notation for an opportunistic traffic to the @xmath17th server of the js - queue model ( see ref . for comparison ) .",
