    "* hereafter nfw ) found that the density profile obeys the `` universal '' form @xmath16 irrespective of the underlying cosmological parameters , the shape of the primordial fluctuation spectrum and the formation histories .",
    "recent high resolution simulations suggest even steeper cusps @xmath17 in the innermost region @xcite , and a weak dependence of the inner slope on the halo mass is also reported @xcite .",
    "the statistics of strong gravitational lensing have been used to probe the density profiles of dark halos , e.g. , multiple qso images @xcite and the long thin arcs @xcite .",
    "these theoretical studies concluded that gravitational lensing rates are extremely sensitive to the inner slope of dark halos .",
    "the lensing statistics of small separations , however , will also be affected by gas cooling and clumpiness in the host halo @xcite .",
    "thus multiple qso images with intermediate or large separations , @xmath18 , are more relevant in constraining the density profile of  pure \" dark halos .    at present , several lensing surveys at large separations have been carried out ; e.g. , the jodrell - bank vla astrometric survey and the cosmic lens all sky survey ( jvas / class ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and arcminute radio cluster - lens search ( arcs ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the jvas / class sample comprises 10,499 radio sources .",
    "an explicit search for lenses has detected no lenses with image separations @xmath19 @xcite , while 18 gravitational lenses with @xmath20 were found @xcite .",
    "arcs also produced a null result for lensing events with @xmath21 from 1,023 extended radio sources .",
    "the lack of large separation images is only marginally consistent if the usual nfw profile and @xmath6-dominated cdm model are assumed @xcite , but it also may be ascribed in part to an effect of the longer time delays between more widely separated images .",
    "any intrinsic variability of the qso will result in images which less resemble each other for longer delays @xcite .",
    "so far , time delays between two images have been used primarily to estimate the hubble constant @xmath1 using a detailed lens model of each system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but the importance of mass distribution in estimating hubble constant has been recognized @xcite and this led to an attempt to constrain the galaxy mass profile from time delays using monte carlo simulations @xcite . instead ,",
    "in this paper , we consider the statistics of the time delay effect analytically .",
    "we derive an expression for the cumulative joint probability , i.e. , the probability that the time delay is larger than @xmath0 and the image separation is @xmath3 , @xmath22 , and also various related statistics . they allow us to estimate the range of probable time delays for a given image separation and the extent to which the intrinsic time variability of quasars affects observed strong gravitational lensing rates .",
    "our most important result is that the distribution of delays is quite sensitive to the density profiles of the lensing objects .",
    "for example , an nfw density profile predicts median time delays a factor of three or so smaller than the density profile proposed by @xcite and @xcite for the same @xmath1 value . while the lenses for which time delays are currently observed are dominated by barionic component , we can constrain the density profile of dark halos if a sample of time delays with large separations becomes available .",
    "it turns out that the time delay statistics are fairly insensitive to other uncertainties , such as the magnification bias and various cosmological parameters and therefore become a relatively reliable estimator for the density profile of dark halos .    of course , all delay values are linearly proportional to the inverse hubble constant , and we here assume its value to be @xmath23 , which is consistent with the final result of hubble space telescope key project @xcite , throughout the remainder of our discussion .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in  2 , we briefly describe the usual formulation of gravitational lensing statistics .",
    "section 3 presents the analytic formulation of time delay statistics .",
    "our main results are shown in  4 .",
    "finally we summarize the main results and discuss their application in  5 .",
    "we denote the image position in the lens plane by @xmath24 and the source position in the source plane by @xmath25 .",
    "we assume spherically symmetric lens objects throughout the paper . in this case , the lens equation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) reduces to @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the characteristic length in the lens plane ( see  2.3 . ) , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the angular diameter distances from the observer to the lens and the source planes , respectively .",
    "the explicit expressions of the scaled deflection angles @xmath32 for the specific lens models are presented in  2.3 .",
    "we consider a halo of mass @xmath33 in the lens plane at a redshift @xmath34 and a source located at @xmath35 .",
    "then the gravitational lensing cross section @xmath36 , defined in the lens plane , for multiple images with image separation larger than @xmath3 and magnification larger than @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the critical source position to form multiple images ( usually given by the position of the radial caustic ) , @xmath40 is the heaviside step function , and @xmath41 denotes the fraction of area satisfying @xmath42 : @xmath43 from this cross section , the probability that a source at @xmath35 is multiply lensed with image separation larger than @xmath3 and magnification larger than @xmath37 is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is determined by solving the equation ; @xmath46 .    to calculate the lens mass distribution",

    "it should be noted that @xmath61 may be interpreted as the magnification of the total images , of the brighter , or of the fainter image among the outer two images , depending on the observational selection procedure for finding gravitational lens systems @xcite . as indicated in  2.3.2",
    ", however , such a different choice of magnification does not affect the conditional time delay probability very much , especially for small inner slope values , while it changes the lensing rate by a factor of two .",
    "thus we choose to designate the magnification @xmath61 in the bias factor ( eq . [ [ biasfactor ] ] ) as the total magnification of all images throughout this paper .",
    "the sis ( singular isothermal sphere ) density profile is usually characterized by a one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath62 : @xmath63 in this case , we choose the characteristic length @xmath29 as @xmath64 then the lens equation has two solutions @xmath65 if @xmath66 .",
    "the separation between two image may be written as @xmath67 the magnification of each image is @xmath68 and their total magnification is given by @xmath69 to compute the probability distribution functions ( [ pd ] ) and ( [ pd_bias ] ) , we also convert the mass function ( eq . [ [ ps ] ] ) to a velocity function by using the spherical collapse model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the halo density profiles predicted by recent n - body simulations may be parameterized as a one - parameter family , the generalized nfw profile @xcite : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a scale radius and @xmath72 is a characteristic density .",
    "the profile with @xmath73 corresponds that nfw originally proposed , while the profile with @xmath13 resembles the one claimed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the scale radius generally depends on the mass and the redshift , and is related to the concentration parameter : @xmath74 the characteristic density is given by @xmath75 with @xmath76 being the hypergeometric function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "following @xcite , we adopt the mass and redshift dependence reported by @xcite and consider the median amplitude of the concentration parameter @xmath77 : @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes the hubble constant in units of @xmath80 .",
    "scatter of the concentration parameter is modeled by a log - normal function with the dispersion of @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "we fix @xmath77 to the value estimated in the simulations @xcite , @xmath82 , throughout this paper .    in these profiles , we choose @xmath83 and denote the scaled deflection angle @xmath32 as @xmath84 . the dimensionless factor @xmath85 ( of order unity ) and the function @xmath86",
    "are related to the dark halo profile as follows : @xmath87 @xmath88 the lens equation has three solutions @xmath89 if @xmath90 , where @xmath39 is the position of the radial caustic .",
    "the image separation is defined between the outer two solution and is approximated as @xcite : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the position of the tangential critical curve ( the einstein radius ) .",
    "the approximation ( eq . [ [ approxsep ] ] ) is sufficiently accurate for the range of interest here ( upper panels of figure [ fig : approx ] ) , and is useful in computing the lensing probability .",
    "the top panels of figure [ fig : approxmag ] shows that the total magnification for the generalized nfw profile is well approximated as @xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are @xmath96 with @xmath97 being the position of the radial critical curve .",
    "finally @xmath98 is given by @xmath99 the magnification of the brighter or fainter image can be approximated as follows : @xmath100 @xmath101 figure [ fig : approxmag ] shows the comparison between the magnifications of the three cases and their approximation described above ( eqs .",
    "[ [ approxmu ] ] , [ [ approxbright ] ] , and [ [ approxfaint ] ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : approxmag ] indicates that the above approximation breaks down around its minimum value . in practice , however , this level of discrepancy does not affect the result of the magnification bias @xcite . more importantly ,",
    "the difference in magnification using total , brighter , or fainter images is only about a factor of two , as easily seen from the above approximations .",
    "that is , the different choices of the magnification only increase ( or decrease ) the probability by a factor of two for all separations .",
    "this numerical factor is canceled out in calculating the conditional probability of time delays because it is defined by the ratio of these probabilities ( see  3.1 ) . in the sis case , however , the difference between the magnification of brighter and fainter image is not negligible ( see eq . [ [ mupm_sis ] ] ) and as a result the effect of different choice of magnification on time delay probability distributions becomes larger .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the effect of different definitions of the magnification is small in time delay statistics , especially for a small inner slope ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the lens alters the time taken for light to reach the observers and inevitably produces a differential time delay between multiple images @xcite .",

    "the fermat potential is written as @xmath106 in terms of the lensing potential @xmath107 .",
    "the explicit expressions for the time delays in the sis and the generalized nfw profiles are given in  3.2 .    the cumulative probability of time delays is calculated from equations ( [ pd_bias ] ) , ( [ biasfactor ] ) , and ( [ timedelay ] ) : @xmath108_{m = m_{\\rm min } } , \\label{delay_pd}\\ ] ] @xmath109 where the superscript @xmath110 on the magnification factor means that the time delay threshold is taken into account",

    "the time delay for the generalized nfw case is given by @xmath125",
    "in what follows , we consider three representative cosmological models dominated by cdm ; lambda cdm ( lcdm ) with @xmath126 , standard cdm ( scdm ) with @xmath127 , and open cdm ( ocdm ) with @xmath128 .",
    "the amplitude of the mass fluctuation , @xmath129 , is normalized so as to reproduce the x - ray luminosity and temperature functions of clusters @xcite .",
    "we calculate the probability distribution of image separations and time delays adopting the detection condition in the jvas / class survey .",
    "the sample of radio sources have a flux distribution with @xmath130 @xcite . in this case , magnification bias factors ( [ biasfactor ] ) and ( [ delay_biasfactor ] ) are simplified and can be written as @xmath131 and @xmath132 with @xmath133 being the slope of the radio luminosity function , @xmath134 . using the fact that the luminosity function is described by a power - law and",
    "the time delay is proportional to the source position ( i.e. , @xmath135 ) , equations ( [ td_biasfactor ] ) and ( [ nt ] ) are also simplified as @xmath136 and @xmath137 the redshift distribution of the parent population of radio sources is not known in the jvas / class survey .",
    "thus we fix the source redshift to the mean redshift of a 27 object subsample , @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "the results are not substantially different if one takes into account the observed redshift distribution of the subsample @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : prob ] plots the predicted probability distribution of image separations for various density profiles ( _ left panel _ ) ; sis , generalized nfw with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , and also for various cosmological models ( _ right panel _ ) fixing @xmath13 , for reference .",
    "as shown in these plots , the probability strongly depends on the inner profile of dark halos .",
    "the steeper inner profile produces multiple lenses much more efficiently .",
    "the jvas / class data are also shown in figure [ fig : prob ] .",
    "this plot indicates that small separation lensing is consistent with the sis model , while the sis model predicts too much large separation lensing , as previously shown by @xcite .",
    "consider next the time delay probability distributions .",
    "figure [ fig : cuml ] plots the cumulative conditional probability ( eq . [ [ cond_p ] ] ) for different density profiles , and figure [ fig : diff_ano ] plots its logarithmic time derivative : @xmath139 the cosmological model is lcdm in each case .",
    "we present results both with and without the magnification bias effects . in the top panel of figure [ fig : cuml ] ,",
    "we plot the three cases of magnification bias defined by that of the total , brighter , and fainter images .",
    "the effect of different choice of magnification in the generalized nfw case is smaller than in the sis case , as discussed in  2.3.2 .",
    "these plots indicate that time delay statistics depend strongly on the inner slope of the density profile , @xmath140 .",
    "steeper inner profiles tend to produce longer time delays .",
    "this is probably because of the deeper gravitational potential for steeper inner profiles .",
    "the non - geometric part of the time delay is simply proportional to the difference in the potential value at the image positions .",
    "therefore , we can constrain the density profile of dark halos from this statistics if a reliable and unbiased sample of time delays becomes available .",
    "we note the difference in the asymptotic behavior in the limit of small @xmath0 for different magnification biases . for the sis profile",
    ", we obtain the asymptotic behavior of the conditional probability distribution in the limit of the small @xmath141 from equations ( [ muy_sis ] ) , ( [ tdelay_sis ] ) and ( [ simple_delay_biasfactor ] ) : @xmath142 for the generalized nfw profile , we also obtain the same relation from equations ( [ approxmu ] ) , ( [ tdelay_nfw ] ) and ( [ simple_delay_biasfactor ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic behavior ( [ asympt ] ) indicates that the uncertainty in the slope of the qso luminosity function severely affects the probability of shorter time delays .",
    "we are not concerned with details of @xmath2 at small @xmath0 , where various uncertainties such as the finite size of the sources may affect the shape of @xmath2 anyway . except for the small @xmath0 regime , however , the uncertainty of the magnification bias is negligible and the time delay probability distribution depends primarily on the inner slope of lens density profile .",
    "in fact , the cumulative conditional probability @xmath143 with or without magnification bias is quite similar and probably observationally indistinguishable for the foreseeable future .",
    "in particular , the insensitivity of magnification bias shown in figures [ fig : cuml ] and [ fig : diff_ano ] is in marked contrast with the usual lensing probability as a function of image separation which is affected by more than one order of magnitude @xcite .    to see the dependence of separations and density profiles on the conditional probability distributions more clearly",
    ", we calculate the median time delays @xmath144 as follows : @xmath145 we plot the @xmath144 as a function of separations @xmath3 in figure [ fig : meddis_obs ] .",
    "the comparison with the observation in this figure will be discussed in  4.3 .",
    "the error - bars in this plot are defined by the @xmath146 level .",
    "this figure shows that the median time delays are well fitted by the power - law : @xmath147 the best - fit values for @xmath148 and @xmath149 are summarized in table [ table : fit ] . since @xmath150 for all density profiles , figure [ fig : meddis_alpha_log ] plots @xmath151 to illustrate their strong dependence on @xmath140 .",
    "it is clear in this figure that the difference of @xmath144 between profiles with various @xmath140 values is larger for smaller separations . to probe the density profile of dark halos ,",
    "however , small separation lenses may suffer from the complex physics on baryonic components .",
    "therefore lenses with @xmath152 , which are typically associated with galaxy groups or clusters , may be more useful in constraining the density profile of dark halos .",
    "figure [ fig : meddis_alpha_log ] also indicates that it is difficult to determine the inner slope from a single observed lensing system , and several lensing systems are required to reduce the statistical uncertainty .",
    "next consider the dependence of the statistics on cosmological models or source redshift .",
    "figure [ fig : diff_model ] displays the predictions for different models and source redshifts , indicating that their effects are rather small . in particular , we emphasize that the time delay probability distribution is insensitive to @xmath129 , while the scdm model with @xmath153 yields nearly two orders more multiple lenses compared with @xmath154 .",
    "the time delay probability distribution is also insensitive to the redshift uncertainty , especially at high redshift @xmath155 .",
    "therefore , uncertainties of both cosmological models and redshift are not a significant source of uncertainty in time delay statistics .",
    "this robustness is also an advantage of time delay statistics compared with the usual overall lensing rate statistic .      here",
    "we tentatively compare our theoretical results with the existing observational data , although the detailed modeling is already available for each system in our small sample .",
    "the adopted data are summarized in table [ table : obs ] .",
    "we use time delay data for two images systems and exclude the four image lens systems for simplicity .",
    "the data points in figure [ fig : meddis_obs ] and figure [ fig : cuml_obs ] show the comparison with observations for four lens systems .",
    "although figure [ fig : cuml_obs ] displays a more direct comparison , figure [ fig : meddis_obs ] may be useful also in examining whether there is any dependence of the inner slope @xmath140 on the mass of the lensing objects . for figure",
    "[ fig : meddis_obs ] , we fix the source redshift at @xmath156 , although the source redshift for each system is already known .",
    "this does not make any substantial differences as indicated in figure [ fig : diff_model ] .",
    "we plot the theoretical predictions of sis and generalized nfw density profiles .",
    "observational time delays are indicated by triangles ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : meddis_obs ] ) and arrows ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : cuml_obs ] ) . from these plots , we find that the existing data prefer the steeper inner profiles , sis profile or generalized nfw profile with @xmath13 .",
    "although a different choice of magnification affects the median time delays by at most a factor of two ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cuml ] ) in the sis case and less in the generalized nfw case , this is smaller than the error - bars of median time delays and does not change our basic conclusion .",
    "the steep density profiles we infer are also consistent with the detailed models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of these particular lens systems .",
    "of course , the image separations in the lens sample considered here correspond to the inner regions of the lensing galaxies where a plethora of evidence ( especially rotation curves ) already lead us to expect a roughly isothermal distribution of the total mass , luminous and dark combined , so the results are hardly surprising .",
    "in this paper , we formulated the differential time delay probability distribution and examined its dependence on lens density profiles as well as on magnification bias , cosmological model , and source redshift .",
    "we found that the probability distribution of time delays depends most sensitively on the inner slope of the lens density profiles .",
    "the difference between the various density profiles we examined is very large , more than one order .",
    "for example , if @xmath157 , @xmath6-dominated cosmology and a source redshift @xmath7 are assumed , lenses with @xmath8 induce the time delay ; @xmath9=1.5^{+1.7}_{-0.9}$ ] , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ( 50% level ) , for sis , generalized nfw with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , the effects of cosmological models , source redshifts or magnification bias are rather small , aside from the well known and important linear dependence on the inverse hubble constant .",
    "moreover , the delay distributions are quite insensitive to the normalization of the overall lensing rate , because the conditional probability is defined by the joint probability divided by the usual lensing probability and the differing of normalizations are almost canceled out . therefore , one could strongly constrain the core structure of dark halos if a large sample of time delays becomes available in future systematic survey .",
    "although existing lens systems are individually modeled in detail including the central density profiles , such careful treatment of each lens system in upcoming very large samples may not always be practical .",
    "thus a _ statistical _ treatment of time delays is informative .",
    "for example , we can predict the range of probable time delays of large separation lenses from this formulation if the density profile of dark halos is fully settled .",
    "this would allow estimation of a plausible range of time delays for _ future _ lens systems even when the lensing object has not been identified .",
    "comparison with the meager existing observational data suggests that the density profile has a rather steep cusp , @xmath158 , although it is already known that the current observed systems are dominated by baryonic component .",
    "moreover , it seems that the smaller separation lenses prefer steeper inner profiles .",
    "this result may support a two - population model , i.e. , galactic mass halos with a steep inner slope ( @xmath158 ) and cluster mass halos with a shallower inner slope ( @xmath102 ) , as proposed by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . to see whether there are two ( or more ) populations of halos , time delay data for various separations , especially separations with @xmath152 , will be essential .",
    "another application of time delay statistics is that future large samples of lenses will probably be systematically monitored by one or more of the ambitious synoptic surveys now being planned .",
    "designing an efficient sampling rate and observing strategy requires an idea of the range of time delays that might reasonably be expected .",

    "<S> the distribution of differential time delays @xmath0 between images produced by strong gravitational lensing contains information on the mass distributions in the lensing objects as well as on cosmological parameters such as @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an explicit expression for the conditional probability distribution function of time delays @xmath2 , given an image separation between multiple images @xmath3 , and related statistics . </S>",
    "<S> we consider lensing halos described by the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) approximation and by its generalization as proposed by navarro , frenk , & white ( nfw ) which has a density profile @xmath4 in the innermost region . </S>",
    "<S> the time delay distribution is very sensitive to these profiles ; steeper inner slopes tend to produce larger time delays . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if @xmath5 , a @xmath6-dominated cosmology and a source redshift @xmath7 are assumed , lenses with @xmath8 produce a time delay of @xmath9=1.5^{+1.7}_{-0.9}$ ] , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ( 50% confidence interval ) , for sis , generalized nfw with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , respectively . at a fixed image separation , </S>",
    "<S> the time delay is determined by the difference in the lensing potential between the position of the two images , which typically occur at different impact parameters . </S>",
    "<S> although the values of @xmath0 are proportional to the inverse of @xmath1 , @xmath2 is rather insensitive to all other cosmological model parameters , source redshifts , magnification biases and so on . </S>",
    "<S> a knowledge of @xmath2 will also be useful in designing the observing program of future large scale synoptic variability surveys and for evaluating possible selection biases operating against large splitting lens systems . </S>"
