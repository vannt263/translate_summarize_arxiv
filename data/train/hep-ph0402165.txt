    "mesonic chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite has been tremendously successful and may be considered as a full - grown and mature area of low - energy particle physics ( for a recent review , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the prerequisite for an effective field theory program is ( a ) a knowledge of the most general effective lagrangian and ( b ) an expansion scheme for observables in terms of a consistent power counting method @xcite . in the mesonic sector",
    "the lagrangian is known up to and including @xmath0 in the momentum and quark mass expansion @xcite .",
    "the combination of dimensional regularization with the modified minimal subtraction scheme of chpt @xcite leads to a straightforward correspondence between the loop expansion and the chiral expansion in terms of momenta and quark masses at a fixed ratio , and thus provides a consistent power counting for renormalized quantities . in the extension to the one - nucleon sector",
    "@xcite the correspondence between the loop expansion and the chiral expansion , at first sight , seems to be lost : higher - loop diagrams can contribute to terms as low as @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this problem has been eluded in the framework of the heavy - baryon formulation of chpt @xcite , resulting in a power counting analogous to the mesonic sector .",
    "the price one pays consists of giving up manifest lorentz invariance of the lagrangian .",
    "in addition , at higher orders in the chiral expansion , the expressions due to @xmath2 corrections of the lagrangian become increasingly complicated @xcite .",
    "finally , not all of the scattering amplitudes , evaluated perturbatively in the heavy - baryon framework , show the correct analytical behavior in the low - energy region . in the following",
    "we will outline some recent developments in devising a renormalization scheme leading to a simple and consistent power counting for the renormalized diagrams of a manifestly lorentz - invariant approach .",
    "in order to illustrate the issue of power counting , let us consider the lowest - order @xmath3 lagrangian @xcite , expressed in terms of bare fields and parameters denoted by subscripts 0 , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote a doublet and a triplet of bare nucleon and pion fields , respectively .",
    "after renormalization , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 refer to the chiral limit of the physical nucleon mass , the axial - vector coupling constant , and the pion - decay constant , respectively .",
    "the most general effective lagrangian of the interaction of goldstone bosons with nucleons consists of a string of terms @xmath10 where the superscripts refer to the order in the derivative and quark - mass expansion @xcite .",
    "in addition , one needs the most general effective lagrangian of the mesonic sector @xcite @xmath11 containing only even powers in the chiral expansion .",
    "the aim is to devise a renormalization procedure generating , after renormalization , the following power counting : a loop integration in @xmath12 dimensions counts as @xmath13 , pion and fermion propagators count as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , vertices derived from @xmath16 and @xmath17 count as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . here , @xmath20 generically denotes a small expansion parameter such as , e.g. , the pion mass . in total",
    "this yields for the power @xmath21 of a diagram in the one - nucleon sector the standard formula @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 denote the number of independent loop momenta , internal pion lines , internal nucleon lines , vertices originating from @xmath16 , and vertices originating from @xmath17 , respectively .",
    ".,height=113 ]    as an example , let us consider the one - loop contribution of fig .",
    "[ fig : nucleonselfenergypionloop ] to the nucleon self - energy . according to eq .",
    "( [ dimension1 ] ) , after renormalization , we would like to have the order @xmath28 applying the @xmath29 renormalization scheme of chpt @xcite  indicated by `` r''one obtains @xmath30= { \\cal o}(q^2),\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the lowest - order expression for the squared pion mass . in other words , the @xmath29-renormalized result does not produce the desired low - energy behavior of eq .",
    "( [ dexample ] ) .",
    "this finding has widely been interpreted as the absence of a systematic power counting in the relativistic formulation of chpt .",
    "recently , several methods have been suggested to obtain a consistent power counting in a manifestly lorentz - invariant approach @xcite .",
    "here , we will concentrate on the so - called extended on - mass - shell ( eoms ) renormalization scheme @xcite .",
    "the central idea of the eoms scheme consists of performing additional subtractions beyond the @xmath29 scheme .",
    "since the terms violating the power counting are analytic in small quantities , they can be absorbed by counterterm contributions .",
    "we will illustrate our approach in terms of the integral @xmath32[k^2+i0^+]},\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is a small quantity .",
    "we want the ( renormalized ) integral to be of the order @xmath34 . applying the dimensional counting analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite ( for an illustration , see the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the result of the integration is of the form @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath9 and @xmath36 are hypergeometric functions and are analytic in @xmath37 for any @xmath12 . hence , the part containing @xmath36 for noninteger @xmath12 is proportional to a noninteger power of @xmath37 and satisfies the power counting . on the other hand @xmath9",
    "violates the power counting .",
    "the crucial observation is that the part proportional to @xmath9 can be obtained by _",
    "first _ expanding the integrand in small quantities and _ then _ performing the integration for each term @xcite .",
    "this observation suggests the following procedure : expand the integrand in small quantities and subtract those ( integrated ) terms whose order is smaller than suggested by the power counting . in the present case",
    ", the subtraction term reads @xmath38[k^2+i0^+]}\\right|_{p^2=m^2}\\ ] ] and the renormalized integral is written as @xmath39 as @xmath40 . in the infrared renormalization scheme of becher and leutwyler @xcite , one would keep the contribution proportional to @xmath36 ( with subtracted divergences when @xmath12 approaches 4 ) and completely drop the @xmath9 term .",
    "in the chiral limit of massless @xmath41 and @xmath42 quarks , the qcd lagrangian has a _ global _ @xmath43 symmetry . as a consequence of this symmetry ,",
    "green functions involving the noether currents are constrained by ward identities .",
    "the green functions may most efficiently be combined in a generating functional through a coupling of the quark bilinears to external fields @xcite . in the framework of chiral perturbation theory , the generating functional",
    "is calculated by means of the most general effective mesonic and @xmath3 lagrangians . by construction ,",
    "the effective lagrangian of the relativistic formulation is manifestly chirally invariant under _ local _",
    "@xmath43 transformations provided the external fields are transformed accordingly @xcite .",
    "local _ invariance of the lagrangian guarantees that the chiral ward identities of qcd ( as well as their symmetry - breaking pattern ) are encoded in the generating functional which is now determined through the _ effective _ field theory .    in the following",
    "we will briefly discuss the consequences of chiral symmetry for the renormalization program ( for a similar discussion , see ref .",
    "the tree graphs calculated in terms of the effective lagrangian separately satisfy the ward identities .",
    "dimensional regularization is known to respect the symmetry relations induced by chiral symmetry for arbitrary @xmath12 so that the corresponding regularized loop diagrams also satisfy the ward identities .",
    "the one - loop diagrams may be divided into two parts : the first part is proportional to noninteger power(s ) of the small expansion parameter(s ) and the second part is analytic .",
    "the nonanalytic parts can not be altered by changing the renormalization prescription and thus necessarily satisfy the ward identities independently from the analytic parts .",
    "the analytic parts satisfy the ward identities order by order in small expansion parameters . in our renormalization procedure",
    "we subtract all terms of the expansion of the analytic parts of the one - loop diagrams that violate the power counting .",
    "these subtraction terms satisfy the ward identities order by order .",
    "hence the renormalized diagrams also respect the ward identities .    for multi - loop diagrams the procedure is analogous albeit technically more complicated . for example , two - loop diagrams may contain parts which are nonanalytic in the expansion parameter(s ) and which can not be altered by the renormalization condition .",
    "these parts do not violate the power counting and satisfy the ward identities separately",
    ". however , there may also be contributions which are nonanalytic but depend on the renormalization condition for the one - loop sub - diagrams . if the finite parts of the counterterms are fixed so that the power counting is satisfied at the one - loop level , then these parts of two - loop diagrams , combined with contributions from counterterm diagrams renormalizing one - loop sub - diagrams , satisfy power counting ( see ref .",
    "as long as the renormalization of the one - loop diagrams respects chiral symmetry , the above second type of nonanalytic parts also satisfies the ward identities .",
    "finally , the third part is analytic and can be altered by counterterms .",
    "starting from here , the argument is as for the one - loop case .",
    "this ( standard ) procedure of renormalization is then performed iteratively for diagrams with an increasing number of loops .",
    "let us first discuss the result for the mass of the nucleon at @xmath44 @xcite , @xmath45 [ applications ]     +    where the coefficients @xmath46 are given by @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is a linear combination of @xmath44 coefficients @xcite . in order to obtain an estimate for the various contributions of eq .",
    "( [ mnoq4 ] ) to the nucleon mass , we make use of the set of parameters @xmath49 of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath50 which were obtained from a ( tree - level ) fit to @xmath3 scattering threshold parameters . using the numerical values @xmath51     +    we obtain for the mass of nucleon in the chiral limit ( at fixed @xmath52 ) : @xmath53\\,\\mbox{mev } = 882.8\\ , \\mbox{mev}\\ ] ] with @xmath54 . here , we have made use of an estimate for @xmath55 obtained from the @xmath56 term ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the chiral expansion reveals a good convergence and it will be interesting to further study the convergence at the two - loop level @xcite ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "as another example , let us consider the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon which are defined via the matrix element of the electromagnetic current operator as @xmath57 u(p_i ) , \\,\\",
    "n = p , n,\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the momentum transfer and @xmath59 .",
    "figure 3 shows the results for the electric and magnetic sachs form factors @xmath60 and @xmath61 at @xmath44 in the eoms scheme ( solid lines ) @xcite and the infrared renormalization ( dashed lines ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath44 results only provide a decent description up to @xmath62 and do not generate sufficient curvature for larger values of @xmath63 .",
    "we conclude that the perturbation series converges , at best , slowly and that higher - order contributions must play an important role .",
    "it remains to be seen to what extent a _ consistent _ inclusion of vector mesons @xcite improves the quality of the description .",
    "the eoms scheme allows for a simple and consistent power counting in manifestly lorentz - invariant baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "since it can also be applied at the multi - loop level @xcite it will be interesting to consider selected two - loop examples and address the question of convergence . moreover , the infrared renormalization of becher and leutwyler has been reformulated in a form analogous to the eoms renormalization scheme @xcite and can thus also be applied to multi - loop diagrams with an arbitrary number of particles with arbitrary masses ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . clearly , the method has a large potential and it will be interesting to apply it to electromagnetic processes such as compton scattering and pion production .",
