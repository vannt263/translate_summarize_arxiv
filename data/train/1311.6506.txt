    "n - type doping , easily achieved with group iii elements ( al , ga , in, ... )-although in does not seem to be an economical and nature - friendly option due to its natural scarcity and toxicity- , improves both their electrical and optical properties.@xcite however , and in spite of the considerable effort that scientific community is doing in order to understand the mechanisms that rule the doping effectiveness in such zno doped materials , there is still a lack of knowledge on the dopants interaction with zno host matrix and their intrinsic defects and how it affects to the zno electronic structure .",
    "recent results on ga- and al - doped zno thin films grown by magnetron sputtering ( doping content 1% at . for both films ) showed substantial differences in their electric and optical properties.@xcite on the one hand , ga - zno temperature resistivity behavior was metallic - like and the film presented an increased optical bandgap , 3.63 ev vs. 3.21 ev measured for the undoped film , both facts being consistent with substitutional doping . on the other hand , al - zno film behaved as a semiconductor and showed little variation in the optical gap ( 3.25 ev ) compared with pure zno .",
    "since al and ga have similar electronic structure in their valence levels , they were expected to behave analogously as substitutional dopants in the zno matrix .",
    "hence , the different doped film behaviors were then attributed to the tendency of al and ga cations to occupy different insertion sites in the host zno .",
    "the electrical properties of zno and al - zno correspond to a semiconductor with conduction electrons thermally activated , i.e. , the resistivity decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "the resistivity of al - zno ( @xmath0 @xmath1  cm ) is one order of magnitude smaller than for undoped zno .",
    "ga - zno presents metallic behavior , with resistivity increasing with temperature ( @xmath2 @xmath1  cm ) , about 30 times smaller than for al - zno .",
    "the ga - zno film carrier density deduced from hall effect measurements@xcite is one order of magnitude larger than for al - zno ( @xmath3 vs @xmath4 @xmath5 ) . from these carrier concentrations ,",
    "a conduction band population of 0.7 and 0.04 electrons per dopant atom can be inferred in ga - zno and al - zno , respectively .",
    "therefore , doping effectiveness seems to be modulated by the presence of acceptor defects , that would compensate partially ( ga - zno ) or almost totally ( al - zno ) , the donor doping .",
    "new data@xcite from hard x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( haxpes ) have revealed an electronic band in the doped material , near the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) , which is considerably stronger in ga - zno than in al - zno .",
    "haxpes is better suited than conventional photoelectron spectroscopy for the exploration of the density of states ( dos ) at the valence band ( vb ) and fermi level regions , since the contribution of surface features is strongly reduced.@xcite    in this article , we explore the electronic structure of a number of defects in heavily doped al - zno and ga - zno by means of density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "we identify the defects that can explain the peculiar haxpes band and the electrical properties observed in al - zno and ga - zno .",

    "their greatest limitation for semiconductor materials is the underestimation of the fundamental bandgap . in the case of zno ,",
    "part of this inaccuracy is produced because the zn 3d binding energy is underestimated by several ev due to the self - interaction error .",
    "therefore , the zn 3d and o 2p levels , present an incorrectly large hybridization , pushing up the top valence band composed mainly of o 2p levels.@xcite the on - site coulomb interaction method ( gga+u)@xcite allows to obtain the correct binding energy for the zn 3d levels , using a hubbard term correction for the 3d levels of zn with the parameter @xmath7 ev@xcite ) . correcting the energy of zn 3d states , the mixing with o 2p states",

    "we have used the hybrid functional of heyd , scuseria and ernzerhof ( hse)@xcite .",

    "the doubly charged state @xmath66 has been found to be thermodynamically stable@xcite for values of the fermi level at 0.4 ev below the cbm and higher .",

    "cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     it must be mentioned that our previous analysis of photoemission spectra by means of comparison with calculated dos do not account for electronic relaxation in the final state .",

    ", there is a strong variation in the energy of top last occupied orbital of the charged state , when it gets emptied by the photoemission .",
    "this abrupt change deserves further analysis .",
    "the haxpes binding energies are in fact excitation energies or quasiparticle energies . due to the size of our system",
    "it is not possible to perform a quasi - particle calculation .",
    "however , the excitation energy can be estimated using the slater - janak theorem as established in ref .  .",
    "the binding energy of the top - most valence electron @xmath68 in the charged state ( @xmath69 electrons ) can be obtained as @xmath70.\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the energy of the orbital that becomes unoccupied in the excitation , and @xmath72 is the occupation number .",
    "we have obtained the values @xmath73 and -1.64 ev for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively . graphically , the haxpes emission peak should be halfway between the energies of level that is filled at the charged state ( @xmath76 ) and empty at the uncharged state ( @xmath77 ) . here",
    "the one - electron energies are referred to the supercell average electrostatic potential as usual in periodic dft calculations . adding the fermi level energy one recovers the usual binding energy . in the same calculation",
    "the cbm is at 2.22 ev .",
    "hence , if the material is n - type and the fermi level is just below the cbm , as in al - zno , the binding energy would be 0.42 ev below the fermi level .",
    "hence , the defect @xmath78 can still be responsible of the small haxpes peak . in the case of ga - zno , for the stable @xmath79",
    ", the haxpes peak would be shifted by 0.16 ev towards the valence band , and considering that the fermi level is also shifted by 0.4 ev in the opposite direction , we think this separation would result in a double peak structure , in disagreement with the experiment . however , the metastable configuration has a band that overlaps with the cb edge , in nice agreement with the haxpes spectrum .",
    "the issue of the relative stabilities of both configurations needs to be clarified in future work , using methods more accurate for the total energy , obtaining the energy barrier between both configurations , and studying the effect of stress .",
    "table [ tab : resumen ] shows the defects and combinations that match the experimental data . in al - zno , the electrical properties",
    "are explained by substitutional @xmath80 compensated by zn vacancies , in ratio 2:1 ( we do not count the zn vacancy of @xmath80 ) , or combinations of both defects .",
    "the small haxpes band below the fermi level can be attributed to a small amount of oxygen interstitials @xmath81 ( exchanged by zn vacancies ) or interstitials @xmath82 ( exchanged by @xmath80 ) .    in ga - zno , the electrical metallic behavior is explained by substitutional @xmath24 , partially compensated by acceptor defects .",
    "@xmath83 can provide compensation by accepting one electron , and it also would cause the observed haxpes band below the fermi level .",
    "compensation can also be achieved by zn vacancies ( or the combination @xmath41 ) , but it can not be the cause of the haxpes band .",
    "an alternative to simple @xmath24 is the combination @xmath84 , which justify simultaneously the haxpes band and the electron donation .",
    "the presence of a haxpes band below the fermi level has been reported for al - zno@xcite , sn - in@xmath57o@xmath85@xcite , and seems to be a robust effect in heavily doped semiconductor oxides .",
    "the sensitivity of haxpes to cb states is facilitated by the fact that photoionization cross sections decrease much faster for o 2p shell than than for other elements , at photon energies over 2 kev .",
    "this factor reduces the signal from the vb edge , composed mostly of o 2p states , compared to the cb edge , that presents contributions from other atomic shells .",
    "the role of photoionization cross sections in the shape of the haxpes spectra from the valence bands have been clearly shown.@xcite it is less clear for the cb edge , as these states should be qualitatively different to the atomic levels .",
    "in fact , the haxpes band was not observed for undoped , but still n - type , in@xmath57o@xmath85 , similarly to our case . for heavily doped al - zno,@xcite a coincident haxpes spectra",
    "was obtained , although with a shorter vb tail than in the samples here studied . moreover",
    ", transient capacitance measurements revealed the presence of a deep defect level with energy about 0.3 ev below the cbm , and concentration comparable to the shallow donor concentration .",
    "these data could be explained by the presence of @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "the differences between al- and ga- heavily doped zno films may have their origin in the association of each dopant with different structural defects in the zno matrix . in that way",
    ", a particular kind of defect could be present in the ga - doped film , while absent , or in quite different concentration , in the al - doped film .",
    "dft and beyond calculations of the dos induced by a list of defects and defect combinations around the band gap for these doped films have allowed to identify the most probable ones in each material .",
    "the comparison of the calculated dos with the experimental haxpes spectra and the analysis of the consequences that each particular defect or defect combination would have on the electrical and optical properties allowed to discard the non suitable ones .",
    "it seems that the al cations can be located either at substitutional or octahedral interstitial sites , while the ga cations can be only in substitutional sites .",
    "al and ga substitutional impurities @xmath30 ( m = al , ga ) are donors but the electrical behavior of the al - zno and ga - zno films suggests that they can not be the only doping induced defect in the zno matrix .",
    "moreover , different degrees of electron compensations are required in each material in order to explain the differences in carrier concentration and resistivity .",
    "the only acceptor combinations involving substitutional cations @xmath30 are the complexes with zn vacancies ( @xmath29 , m = al , ga ) and with oxygen interstitials @xmath88 . for the ga - doped film ,",
    "the charged ga complex with oxygen interstitial @xmath89 may explain the haxpes peak observed below the cb edge , although only as a metastable state with the same geometry as the uncharged state .",
    "the uncharged state presents a half occupied band that may explain the metallic behavior of ga - zno . for the al - zno film ,",
    "interstitial @xmath90 is the best candidate to explain the small haxpes peak observed near the fermi level , but some other defects would be present in the al - doped film .",
    "the acceptors @xmath91 and/or @xmath92 can explain the compensation and the resistivity semiconducting behavior , and the second can also contribute to the haxpes band near the fermi level .",
