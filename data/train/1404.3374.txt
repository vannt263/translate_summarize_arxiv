    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has enjoyed a remarkable success in explaining various experimental data . occasionally some observations have shown deviations from the sm expectation , but have disappeared later with the increase in statistics .",
    "nonetheless , the possibility of new physics being indicated by experimental data  @xcite has constantly driven physicists towards an inspired quest . on the theoretical front , the sm does have some shortcomings as it has too many free parameters and offers no answer to some of the fundamental questions .",
    "an example is the issue of naturalness , or the stability of the higgs boson mass against quadratically divergent corrections . in order to address questions such as this , many theoretical scenarios are exploited , with or without direct connections with the questions asked .",
    "the currently running large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern ( and the next generation accelerators ) will hopefully provide us with some clues .",
    "+ an observation that once created some stir was the measurement of the forward - backward asymmetry ( @xmath8 ) of the @xmath9 quark  @xcite , by the lep experiments .",
    "it showed about 2.9@xmath10 deviation from the value predicted by the best fit to the precision electroweak observables within the sm  @xcite . in the leptonic sector",
    "no such discrepancy was observed .",
    "these results have motivated many theories , which resolve this disagreement through the introduction of new quark degrees of freedom or new possible gauge bosons .",
    "the study of new quarks mixing with the chiral fermions of the sm has been an important area of investigation for quite some time now .",
    "many theories beyond the sm ( bsm ) naturally predict the existence of such vectorlike quarks . they have been studied in the context of the superstring - inspired @xmath11 models  @xcite , little higgs theories  @xcite and also extra dimensional models  @xcite .",
    "many of these scenarios also predict vectorlike leptons .",
    "our focus , however , will be on vectorlike quarks , since they can be expected to be produced at the lhc through strong interactions . depending on the context",
    ", these vectorlike quarks can exist as triplets , doublets or singlets under @xmath12 gauge group and can have different hypercharges under @xmath13 . on the other hand the presence of new chiral fermions , like the one predicted by fourth generation theories , with couplings similar to the sm ones , are disfavoured by data  @xcite which allow a narrow mass window for their survival .",
    "the limits on these quarks from various experiments are discussed later .",
    "+ in a general context , vectorlike quarks can be both top - like ( charge @xmath14 ) and bottom - like ( charge @xmath15 ) vector singlet .",
    "we consider vectorlike isosinglet quarks in both the sectors as possibilities , taking one at a time in addition to the three generations of sm chiral fermions .",
    "the extension of the sm through the inclusion of a weak isospin singlet fermion leads to mixing between the singlet fermions and the sm doublets and hence different phenomenological consequences from what are predicted by the sm .",
    "the aim of our work is to distinguish between the singlets top- and bottom - type ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) from their decays . in particular",
    "we wish to utilise the fact that the decay into higgs is possible , and that the mass of the higgs is known to us now .",
    "the dominant decays of @xmath6 and @xmath7 are expected to be    1 .",
    "2 .   @xmath17 .    with the discovery of a higgs like boson by the lhc experiments @xcite ,",
    "the decay mode @xmath18 is a channel of interest .",
    "we make use of this fact and tag five @xmath9 s along with the requirement of two @xmath9 pairs giving invariant mass peaks at @xmath19 for both the isosinglets .",
    "we find that we can distinguish between the signals present on account of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "+ the collider phenomenology of these vectorlike isosinglets has been considered extensively in the literature(for most recent ones  @xcite -@xcite ) . in the earlier works ,",
    "events are mainly selected with a final state composed of @xmath20 or @xmath5 bosons and jets consistent with the decay of the heavy quarks .",
    "once a signal is obtained , it becomes necessary to pinpoint the new physics scenario which leads to it .",
    "since both @xmath6 and @xmath7 mimic the same signal through these channels , we are addressing this question by our analysis through the higgs decay channel .",
    "+ the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ pheno ]",
    "we discuss the couplings of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 separately to the sm fields , through the effective lagrangian in a model -independent way . in section  [ signal ]",
    "we discuss the signal and the background along with the methodology adopted for the analysis of the signal . in section  [ results ] the results of our numerical analysis based on monte carlo simulations is presented .",
    "we summarise and conclude in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "strong processes can produce both @xmath6 and @xmath7-type quarks at the lhc with identical rates , through gluon fusion or quark - antiquark annihilation . such pair - production , whose rates are independent of the degree of singlet - doublet mixing , are the modes relevant for our study . though single - production is also possible , perhaps with less phase space suppression , it is + ( a )  driven by electroweak couplings , and + ( b )  suppressed by the singlet - doublet mixing angle(s ) .",
    "+ the left and right handed component of the vectorlike quarks have the same quantum number under @xmath21 unlike the sm ones which are chiral .",
    "i ) : :    @xmath22 with electric charge    @xmath1 , and mixes with @xmath23 .",
    "ii ) : :    @xmath24 with electric    charge @xmath3 , and mixes with @xmath9 .      with the addition of the isosinglet quarks to the sm content , we assume mixing to take place mainly with the third generation of the quarks .",
    "we show below the general scheme of mixing in the down sector ; the pattern is similar in the up - sector as well .",
    "the weak eigenstates are denoted by @xmath25 and they are related to the mass eigenstate by  @xcite    @xmath26    where @xmath27    the unprimed fields denote the basis , where , the mass matrix of the up - type quarks are diagonalized .",
    "the submatrix @xmath28 consisting of the first three rows of the @xmath29 matrix is the charged current matrix analogous to the sm ckm matrix and is not unitary .",
    "the addition of the fourth row restores the unitarity of u. the charged current interaction in the mass basis is now given by : @xmath30w^+_\\mu + h.c.\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the electromagnetic coupling constant , @xmath32 is the weak mixing angle and @xmath33 is the relevant @xmath34 submatrix of u. the indices @xmath35 run over the quark generations ( @xmath36 = 1 - 3 , @xmath37 = 1 - 4 ) , and @xmath38 = ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath23 ) , @xmath40 = ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath9 , @xmath7 ) . as a consequence of mixing between fields with different weak isospin ( @xmath42 ) , flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc )",
    "processes appear at the tree level , something that is absent in the sm framework .",
    "we therefore get @xmath43 and @xmath44 interactions .",
    "in addition , the su(2 ) singlet field @xmath7 in the flavor terms can have a gauge invariant ` bare ' mass term , contrary to @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath9 . as a result",
    "the mass and yukawa coupling matrices can not be simultaneously diagonalised , and the physical states can have flavor changing yukawa interactions . the neutral current interaction in the mass basis is given by : @xmath45z_\\mu\\ ] ] the index @xmath46 runs from 1 to 3 , whereas @xmath36 and @xmath37 runs from 1 to 4 .",
    "the electromagnetic current @xmath47 is diagonal in the mass basis and is @xmath48 the fcnc coupling as seen from eq .",
    "( [ nc ] ) is controlled by @xmath49 , which is a @xmath50 matrix . since the mixing matrix @xmath51 is embedded within the unitary matrix , therefore from eqs .",
    "( [ mix_mat1 ] ) ,  ( [ mix_mat2 ] ) we obtain the relation , @xmath52 now let us come to the full explanation of flavor changing yukawa couplings , already mentioned above .",
    "there are gauge invariant mass terms proportional to @xmath53 and @xmath54 , in the yukawa coupling sector where @xmath55 = ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath9 ) , due to non chiral nature of vector quarks .",
    "as these terms do not arise from the yukawa coupling , therefore , the yukawa matrix can not be simultaneously diagonalized with the mass matrix through a biunitary transformation , consequently giving rise to non diagonal yukawa coupling among the physical quarks .",
    "the relations go analogously for the top sector .",
    "the explicit forms of the yukawa couplings along with the coupling of the gauge bosons to the vector quarks and sm quarks due to mixing are given as @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are dominantly @xmath12 doublet and singlet respectively , both in the up and down sectors , and generically stand for mass eigenstates .",
    "moreover , @xmath57 here denotes third generation quarks only .",
    "the ckm matrix elements of the sm involving the light quarks are directly determined from the experiments and are therefore tightly constrained .",
    "these experimental results also give unitary limits on the other elements which can not be directly determined .",
    "the non - observation of the fcnc decays in the top sector by the tevatron  @xcite and the analysis of single top production in lep  @xcite has set bounds on the ckm matrix elements involving the top quark at 95% cl .",
    "a detailed analysis on the allowed mass range and mixing angle @xmath59 in accordance with the precision electroweak data , flavor physics and oblique parameters is presented in  @xcite .",
    "they have presented the range of the ckm matrix elements allowed for different quark masses in case of different scenarios . for our analysis",
    "we have assumed a simplified version of the matrix given in eqs .",
    "( [ mix_mat1 ] ) and  ( [ mix_mat2 ] ) and describe all the interactions on the addition of an isosinglet fermion by the following mixing matrix @xmath60 we are considering here the mixing of the vector quark with the third generation only as the effect of mixing is very small in the lighter generations for massive vector quarks .",
    "the other elements of the mixing matrix are fixed to the sm value .",
    "thus we are essentially considering the isosinglet quark in either sector mixing with the third family alone , the mixing angle being consistent with all existing constraints .",
    "+ the current phenomenological constraints on vectorlike quarks come from direct production bounds at the various colliders and from flavor physics",
    ". there are various direct limits on their masses depending on the decay channel analysed .",
    "the cdf collaboration has excluded a heavy @xmath6 with sm like couplings at 95% cl up to 358 gev  @xcite and a heavy @xmath7 with sm like couplings at 95% cl up to 372 gev  @xcite .",
    "the search mode in the collider experiments is mainly through the pair production of these exotic quarks and further assuming these quarks to only decay through a particular channel .",
    "the bound obtained by cdf on @xmath7 was by looking for pair produced heavy quark with a 100% branching ratio to @xmath20 + sm quarks .",
    "this analysis mainly constrains all the models predicting this final state .",
    "recent lhc bounds from the atlas  @xcite-@xcite and cms  @xcite data , have set a lower limit on charge 2/3 and -1/3 exotic quark mass , by the investigation through either a particular decay channel or assuming branching ratios to @xmath61 and @xmath62 decay modes in the context of different models .",
    "the exclusion of mass of the vectorlike quarks is mainly dependent on the strength of their couplings . +",
    "all the possible decay modes of the heavy quarks are considered in our analysis .",
    "flavor constraints are also significant for vectorlike quarks .",
    "the mixing of the new quark with the sm quarks leads to the non - unitarity of the @xmath63 sm ckm matrix and non - unitarity of this form is tightly constrained as the unitarity triangle of the sm is being measured with absolute precision .",
    "the presence of fcnc in this case contributes to some processes such as @xmath64 , where the quark @xmath9 changes its flavor by emitting or absorbing @xmath5 or higgs boson . along with it",
    "a photon is also emitted .",
    "the fcnc also leads to @xmath9 meson mixing such as @xmath65 and @xmath66 mixing  @xcite .",
    "there being enormous activity in the flavor sector , it is expected that the experimental data from this sector can be applied to find constraints on the heavy quarks and their mixing with the sm ones .",
    "the constraints obtained in this case are largely model dependent  @xcite and we do not consider them for our analysis .",
    "the benchmark points that we consider for our calculation are presented in table  [ bench ] .",
    ".the various benchmark points used for our analysis , with @xmath59 as the mixing angle denoting the @xmath67 or @xmath68 mixing . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can make the following observations .",
    "* the ratio @xmath69 differs for @xmath6 and @xmath7 by two orders of magnitude , for both the masses of 350 and 500 gev . *",
    "the ratio @xmath70 differs by a factor of 100 in case of 350 gev and by a factor of 10 in the case of 500 gev .",
    "it turns out that the ratio @xmath69 is a better distinguishing observable than @xmath70 and it continues to be so even when the mass of @xmath6 , @xmath7 increases while @xmath70 seems to be sensitive to the @xmath6 , @xmath7 mass , and can only be used as a distinguishing observable for quarks masses unto 700 gev .",
    "in this work we have made an attempt to distinguish between top - like and bottom - like isosinglet quarks which are predicted in several extensions of the sm , at a luminosity of 100 fb@xmath71 and center - of - mass energy of 14 tev at the lhc . on account of being",
    "vectorlike they mix with third generation chiral quarks which leads to flavor changing yukawa interactions along with fcnc .",
    "these quarks have the decay modes , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we have in this work tried to address the question of distinguishing the signatures of these isosinglet vectorlike quarks once they are discovered .    choosing in particular the higgs decay channel out of these possibilities for both @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ", we tried to make a distinction between the two cases .",
    "the higgs decays further to a pair of @xmath9 quarks .",
    "we demand that the two higgs be reconstructed in the mass range 123@xmath74128 gev from the tagged @xmath9 s .",
    "the recent discovery of higgs like resonance at 125.5 gev at the lhc strengthens our analysis .",
    "we choose three final states with 2 , 1 , 0 lepton along with five tagged @xmath9 s which is attainable at the lhc as it can efficiently detect leptons and also tag @xmath9 s .",
    "we find that with a suitable choice of cuts , the sm background is very small for both the signals .",
    "our study overall reveals that , empowered by our recent information on the higgs , we can clearly differentiate between @xmath6 and @xmath7 from ratios of events with various lepton multiplicities in the final state along with two reconstructed higgs .",
