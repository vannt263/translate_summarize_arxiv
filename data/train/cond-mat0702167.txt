    "however , the evidence is growing that the spin splitting in the state - of - the - art qw samples is anisotropic function of the electron wavevector  @xcite . therefore the full interpretation of the experimental data on low temperature spin dynamics in high - quality qw samples needs a theory which takes into account the anisotropy of the spin splitting .",

    "@xmath43 where @xmath15 is the fermi wave vector .",
    "one can see that the total spin oscillates and returns exactly to the initial value each period @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "the spin splitting anisotropy leads to a difference of the spin precession frequencies in different points of the @xmath6 space . as the precession frequencies are not commensurable",
    "the spin will never return to the initial value , however , its time decay will be very slow .",

    "such an asymptotics ( @xmath49 ) holds true even in the case of the arbitrary ratio of @xmath9 and @xmath10 provided @xmath50 , the latter can be seen directly from eq . since the main contribution to the integral comes from the points of the stationary phase , @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "we note that this relaxation is ` reversible ' as it is caused by the spread of the precession frequencies , like for the spin dephasing induced by the spread of @xmath53-factor values .    in the end of this section",

    "now we are in the position to discuss effect of the electron scattering on the spin beats .",

    "@xcite this expression [ eq .",
    "( 17 ) ] is presented with an error : the second term in brackets is missing and the condition @xmath70 is violated .    according to eq .",
    "one can identify two qualitatively different regimes of the spin relaxation : ( i ) spin precession regime with the exponentially decaying spin beats at a frequency @xmath71 and the decay time constant @xmath72 and ( ii ) the collision dominated spin relaxation regime showing exponential damping of the total spin with the spin relaxation time @xmath73 .",
    "the transition between the two regimes takes place at @xmath74 .    in the general case , where both bia and sia terms are present , the spin precession frequency @xmath67 is a function of @xmath21 and all angular harmonics of @xmath75 are intermixed .",
    "eq . can be reduced to a set of linear algebraic equations by the decompositon of @xmath75 into angular harmonics as follows @xmath76 eq . is thus equivalent to an infinite system of the linear equations for the values @xmath77 which reads    @xmath78    here the integer @xmath79 runs from @xmath80 to @xmath81 , @xmath82 is the kronecker symbol and @xmath83 these equations should be supplemented with the initial condition @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",

    "different curves in each panel are calculated for different scattering rate @xmath22 .",
    "even a small admixture of the other term to the strong first term in hamiltonian , e.g. @xmath89 , leads to the damping of the oscillations and quite complicated behavior of @xmath86 .",
    "the inclusion of the scattering first smears the oscillations .",
    "the damping time is non - monotonous function of @xmath22 in accordance with the qualitative discussion presented above . for small scattering rates",
    "the scattering enhances spin relaxation , while for the stronger scattering the spin dynamics becomes collision dominated and the spin relaxation time becomes longer .",
    "the possibility for the experimental observation of these oscillations depends strongly on the relation between the average spin precession frequency @xmath90 , scattering time @xmath0 and thermal broadening time @xmath59 .",
    "namely , the condition @xmath91 guarantees the spin precession regime .",
    "moreover , @xmath92 should be larger than unity in order avoid thermal damping of the oscillations .    the dominant broadening mechanism is therefore determined by the shortest of @xmath59 and @xmath0 .",
    "for very low temperatures @xmath59 is very long while @xmath0 is determined by the carrier scattering on the interface roughness and remote impurities . in this regime",
    "the beats are damped due to electron elastic scattering . in the regime of the intermediate temperatures where electron - electron scattering dominates over the elastic processes governing the momentum relaxation  @xcite , the scattering rate is proportional to @xmath93 and scales as @xmath94  @xcite , whereas the thermal broadening rate @xmath95 , see eq . .",
    "their ratio @xmath96 scales as @xmath97 and can be both larger or smaller than @xmath98 .",
    "for example , in the experimental conditions of ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath99  mev and for the temperatures larger than @xmath100  k the damping of the beats is due to the electron - electron scattering .",
    "we note that in the experiments quasi - equilibrium initial spin distribution can be established during the energy relaxation time @xmath101 which can be comparable with @xmath0 .",
    "in such a case one can not separate two contributions to the beats decay .    in the steady - state experiments one measures the spin polarization degree at the continuous spin generation rate .",
    "let us assume that this rate @xmath102 is directed along @xmath25-axis and is isotropic in the @xmath6 space .",
    "provided the carrier lifetime is much longer than the spin relaxation time , the stationary solution of eqs . -",
    "reads @xmath103 where the average spin-@xmath25 component is given by @xmath104^{\\frac{1}{2}}-1}.\\ ] ] we remind that @xmath105 and @xmath106 are defined by eq . .",
    "for example , if the spin splitting is _ isotropic _ the proportionality coefficient between average spin @xmath107 and @xmath108 is simply given by @xmath109 which coincides with dyakonov - perel spin relaxation rate in the collision dominated regime  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the magnetic field @xmath110 slows down the spin relaxation in the collision dominated regime  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this section is to analyze the effects of the magnetic field for the arbitrary relation between @xmath90 and @xmath22 .",
    "here we neglect the non - zero temperature effects .",
    "the magnetic field has a two - fold effect on the spin dynamics .",
    "first , it causes the precession of electron spins due to larmor effect and , second , the cyclotron motion of the electrons in the field leads to the rotation of the wavevector @xmath6 of a given electron and correspondingly the spin precession vector @xmath42 .",
    "the effects can be taken into account as additional terms in the left hand side of the kinetic equation , namely , @xmath111 and @xmath112 $ ] with @xmath113 and @xmath114 being the larmor and cyclotron frequencies respectively ,  see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "first , we start from the clean limit where the scattering is absent and the spin - splitting is _ isotropic_. one can use the rotating frame of reference where the @xmath7 does not rotate . in this frame",
    "the electron spin experiences the magnetic field being a sum of three components : @xmath115 , @xmath113 and effective field arising due to transition to the non - inertial frame which equals to @xmath116 ( upper sign for @xmath117 and lower sign for @xmath118 )  @xcite .",
    "the spin of the fermi - surface electron exhibits the harmonic oscillations around the non - zero value @xmath119 with the amplitude @xmath120 and frequency @xmath121 where @xmath122 ( sign depends on the splitting mechanism in question )  @xcite .",
    "the difference of beats frequencies for bia and sia spin splittings in the magnetic field allows , in principle , to determine experimentally the symmetry of the spin splitting .",
    "we note that , however , the cyclotron frequency is much larger than the larmor one , @xmath123 in the most conventional systems and we disregard the larmor effect from now on .    for the anisotropic spin splitting spin beats",
    "become anharmonic . applying eq . to the case of _ strongest anisotropy _ @xmath124 and taking into account that @xmath6 rotates with cyclotron frequency we obtain for the total spin @xmath125",
    "one can see that even a small magnetic field restores the strictly periodic spin dynamics with the period @xmath126 , i.e. twice larger than the cyclotron one .",
    "the time dependence of the total spin is quite non - trivial : the spin beats demonstrate multiple harmonics .    in the presence of the scattering , oscillations decay with time as it is seen from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : oscmagn1 ] .",
    "for the anisotropic spin splitting the situation is qualitatively the same , see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : oscmagn1 ] .    if the magnetic field becomes so strong that @xmath127 the variations of the effective field @xmath42 occur on the shorter time - scale than the spin precession in this field .",
    "it means that the anisotropic part of the spin distribution @xmath128 . in other words ,",
    "spin rotation angles between the strong variations of @xmath129 are small .",
    "this regime is analogous to the collision dominated regime where the scattering is faster than the spin rotation .",
    "thus , eq . can be solved by iterations and the total spin decays exponentially with the time - constant @xmath130 where @xmath131 is given by eq . .",
    "we underline that eq .",
    "( as well as the results of ref .",
