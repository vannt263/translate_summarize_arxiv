    "solitons in multi - component systems is a fascinating topic with a rich history spanning diverse areas , including bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in atomic physics  @xcite , optical fibers and photonic crystals in nonlinear optics  @xcite , and integrable systems in mathematical physics  @xcite .",
    "different families of `` vector solitons '' have been predicted in these settings , and also observed in experiments . in the context of atomic becs , the first relevant experimental observation refers to the so - called dark - bright ( db ) solitons , which were created in a repulsive @xmath0rb bec binary mixture , using a phase - imprinting method  @xcite or in two counter - flowing @xmath0rb becs @xcite .",
    "these structures are composed by a dark soliton ( density dip ) in the first component , which creates through the nonlinear coupling an effective trapping potential that localizes a bright soliton ( density bump ) in the second component .",
    "other types of vector solitons , namely `` beating '' dark - dark ( dd ) solitons , were also experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "these solitons have the form of two nonlinearly coupled dark solitons , that perform a breathing oscillation between their densities  @xcite .",
    "beating dd solitons are closely related to the db solitons , as they emerge via a rotation of a db soliton in field configuration space , due to the internal symmetry of the model @xcite ( which , in the homogeneous setting , is actually the so - called manakov system @xcite ) .",
    "the recent experimental realization of spin - orbit coupled ( soc ) becs  @xcite in a multicomponent @xmath0rb condensate has motivated further studies on vector solitons and other nonlinear waves in this setting .",
    "first , we should note that soc - becs are of particular interest mainly due to their relevance in systems having a dirac - like energy band structure .",
    "such systems include , among others , trapped ions  @xcite , photonic crystals  @xcite , sonic crystals  @xcite , graphene  @xcite , and optical waveguides  @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , not surprising that many studies have been devoted to nonlinear structures that may emerge in soc - becs .",
    "indeed , structures with nontrivial topological properties , such as vortices  @xcite , skyrmions @xcite , dirac monopoles @xcite and dark solitons  @xcite , as well as self - trapped states  @xcite , bright solitons  @xcite and also gap - solitons  @xcite , were predicted to occur in soc - becs .",
    "many of the interesting phenomena that can occur in soc - becs are due to their unique energy spectrum , which is composed of two branches ( in the two - component system ) .",
    "the structure of their spectrum is exploited in fundamental effects , such as the zitterbewegung ( zb ) oscillations  @xcite , klein tunneling , or even pair - production  @xcite . regarding zb oscillations",
    ", it should be mentioned that they appear when energy eigenstates from different bands coexist and oscillations of the mean velocity occur .",
    "this phenomenon was observed in recent soc - bec experiments @xcite , and illustrates the versatility of atomic condensates in simulating phenomena of the relativistic dirac equation .",
    "here , we exploit both the inherent nonlinearity of becs and the nature of the spin - orbit energy spectrum , and present beating dd soliton families in soc - becs .",
    "we show that these solitons emerge from states that coexist in the pertinent upper- and lower - energy band of the linear spectrum ; the solitons are `` beating '' , as they perform density oscillations with a characteristic frequency ( the zb frequency @xcite ) . the beating dd solitons that we present in this work are structurally different from the ones studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , since they exist only due to the particular band structure of soc - becs ( and not due to the internal symmetry of the model , as mentioned above ) . using a multiscale expansion method",
    ", we show that these solitons can be systematically constructed via db solitons satisfying a system of two coupled nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations , governing the evolution of states in each of the two energy bands .",
    "the derived solitons feature two different spatial length scales ( again stemming from the structure of the energy spectrum ) , as well as two different temporal scales , corresponding to the fast zb oscillations and the long - time dynamics of the soliton centers .",
    "a connection between the beating dd - solitons and zb oscillations observed in experiments is also provided .",
    "we find that soliton branches of definite parity in the two solution branches exhibit spin oscillations , and also zb oscillations , while branches of non - definite parity have a vanishing z - spin component .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the model and our analytical approximations , namely the derivation of the effective nls system .",
    "section iii is devoted to the analytical and numerical study of the soliton solutions , while in section iv we discuss the zb oscillations .",
    "finally , in section v we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we consider a quasi one - dimensional so coupled bec for which , in the mean - field approximation , the equation of motion is expressed in dimensionless form as @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2^t$ ] and @xmath3 denote the wavefunctions of the two pseudo - spin components , normalized to the respective number of atoms @xmath4 .",

    "we have shown that branches with spin oscillations , exhibit also zb oscillations due to spin - orbit coupling .",
    "our analytical predictions for the dynamics of the zb oscillations were also confirmed numerically .",
    "the derived dark solitons should , in principle , be observable in experiments with spin - orbit coupled becs , similar to the ones already performed in  @xcite , and pose an exciting challenge for the current experimental state - of - the - art .",
    "the generality of the considered model and of our methodology , offer a deeper understanding of solitons dynamics in models with dirac - like energy band ( or other multi - band ) structure : these include the massive thirring model  @xcite , models in nonlinear optics describing optical fiber gratings  @xcite , birefringent optical fibers and coupled optical waveguides  @xcite , or even acoustic surface waves  @xcite .",
