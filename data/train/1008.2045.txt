    "the study of the dilute mean field ising model can be tackled using replica approach which has been successfully applied to many disordered systems , the most celebrated being the sk model  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the method encounters serious difficulties when applied to many other systems because of a proliferation of replica order parameters as , for example , the multi - overlaps in dilute models  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we use a strategy proposed by monasson  @xcite , which we already applied to the dilute ising model  @xcite , for which we computed the exact entropy and energy in the vanishing temperature case .",
    "the monasson strategy is very general and shows how @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the partition function of a generic spin model with disorder ) can be expressed in terms of a maximum with respect to the possible values of @xmath4 positive densities @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 ) with the constraint @xmath7 .    in next section , following  @xcite , we derive the free energy of the dilute ising model in terms of the densities @xmath5 for a generic temperature and also in presence of an external magnetic field with random locations . in section 3 , we consider the zero temperature case , in absence of magnetic field and we show that the model is formally equivalent to a @xmath4 potts model . this observation allows to express the @xmath5 in terms of a single order parameter and the exact solution is easily obtained .",
    "the results coincide with those found in @xcite where the approach is not based on replicas .",
    "we also show that the exactly computed internal energy and entropy allows to draw conclusions about the geography of the associated random graph .",
    "in particular we determine the size of the giant component ( continent ) , the average size of the isolated clusters of connected spins ( islands ) and the average number of bonds per spin in the continent and in the islands . in section 4",
    "we compute exactly the ground state energy and entropy in presence of a randomly located magnetic field .",
    "this allows for a more complete description of the geography , in particular , the number of isolated clusters of connected spins of all given size ( islands ) is determined . in section 5",
    "we extend the scope by considering the same model in the case of a strictly positive temperature , where a second order parameter is needed .",
    "we are able to find out the exact solution in the paramagnetic region and exactly determine the phase transition line . in the ferromagnetic region we provide a solution in terms of an expansion with respect to the second order parameter which can be made as accurate as necessary .",
    "conclusions and outlook are in the final section .",
    "the dilute ferromagnetic ising model is characterized by a number @xmath8 of order @xmath9 of non vanishing ( and positive ) bonds connecting pairs of spins .",
    "the partition function can be written as    @xmath10    where the sum @xmath11 goes on the @xmath12 realizations of the @xmath9 spin variables and the @xmath13 are quenched variables which take the value @xmath14 with probability @xmath15 and @xmath16 otherwise .",
    "the dilution coefficient @xmath17 may take any positive value and the number @xmath8 of bonds is @xmath18 .",
    "this is at variance with the fully connected model where the number of non vanishing bonds is @xmath19 and it is the reason why the dilute ferromagnetic has a richer behavior .    an alternative definition of the partition function can be obtained by taking a number of bonds exactly equal to @xmath8 where @xmath8 can be both a deterministic number proportional to @xmath9 or a quenched random variable with average proportional to @xmath9 and fluctuations of order @xmath20 . in this context the pair of spin to be connected to a given bond is chosen randomly  @xcite . all these models and model ( [ partition1 ] ) are thermodynamically equivalent , i.e. the intensive thermodynamical quantities are the same .    models with lesser dilution   @xcite ( number of bonds of order @xmath21 with @xmath14@xmath0@xmath22@xmath0@xmath23 ) have been also considered , but in this case the thermodynamics is the same of the fully connected model .    the problem of evaluating ( [ partition1 ] ) via the replica method ,",
    "can be approached in many different ways .",
    "a possibility is to follow the same path which has permitted the solution of the sk model using multi - overlaps as replica order parameters .",
    "this strategy leads to a proliferation of parameters and it is unable to give exact answers  @xcite . in  @xcite , we considered a different strategy , which is based , instead , on the densities @xmath5 which are @xmath4 parameters since @xmath6 may assume @xmath4 possible values .    in  @xcite we computed the partition function and ,",
    "therefore , the free energy @xmath24 obtaining    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is given by    @xmath27 \\label{psi}\\ ] ]    where the sum @xmath28 goes on the @xmath4 possible values of the variable @xmath29 and the the @xmath4 possible values of the variable @xmath30 . the maximum is taken with respect the @xmath4 densities @xmath5 with the constraints @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the highly non trivial problem is the maximization of the @xmath5 which , in principle , can be found by a proper parametrization .    the simplest case turns out to be the high temperature paramagnetic region where the maximum is reached when @xmath33 for all @xmath29 , so that    @xmath34    we will show in section 5 that the paramagnetic region is the high temperature region given by @xmath35 ( see also @xcite ) .    in  @xcite we also considered the dilute ferromagnetic system in a magnetic field with random locations .",
    "the partition function of this model is    @xmath36    where @xmath13 are the previously defined quenched variables and the @xmath37 take the positive value @xmath38 with probability @xmath39 and @xmath16 otherwise .    in this case",
    "we get @xmath40 where @xmath41 is obtained by maximizing an expression which is the same of that in ( [ psi ] ) plus the extra term    @xmath42    where the sum @xmath43 goes on the the @xmath4 possible values of the variable @xmath29 .",
    "obviously , @xmath44 .",
    "before trying to compute @xmath41 in the general case , we focus on the zero temperature case , which is exactly solvable both in the vanishing ( next section ) and non vanishing ( section 4 ) magnetic field case . in both cases many conclusions may be drown concerning the structure of the random graph , both for what concerns the giant component ( continent ) and the small islands of connected spins .",
    "let us start by considering the case of vanishing temperature and vanishing magnetic field ( @xmath45 . in the vanishing temperature limit one has @xmath46 and , therefore , @xmath47 becomes @xmath48 .",
    "this term equals @xmath4 when all @xmath49 equals @xmath50 and vanishes otherwise .",
    "therefore , expression ( [ psi ] ) becomes    @xmath51 \\label{psi0}\\ ] ]    which is a standard @xmath4-components potts model @xcite .",
    "the solution is known and can be found assuming that @xmath52 quantities @xmath5 take the value @xmath53 and one takes the value @xmath54 .",
    "the state with different value can be any of the possible @xmath4 , we assume that is the one with all @xmath55 for all @xmath56",
    ". we can write :    @xmath57    which satisfy the constraint @xmath58 .    in  @xcite we used this solution in order to find the exact expression for the ground state internal energy",
    "@xmath59    @xmath60    while the entropy @xmath61 was found to be    @xmath62 \\label{s0}\\ ] ]    the maximum is reached in @xmath63 given by the equation    @xmath64    this equation has a single non negative solution @xmath65 if @xmath66 and one more non trivial positive solution if @xmath67 which corresponds to the maximum .",
    "therefore , at 0 temperature , for @xmath68 the system is in a paramagnetic phase ( @xmath69 ) while for @xmath70 is in a ferromagnetic phase ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath63 is the magnetization of the system , but we will see that it has a simple interpretation in terms of underling random graph and that its discontinuity corresponds to the percolation transition generated by the ferromagnetic links .    using equation ( [ thetac ] ) we can rewrite the entropy ( [ s0 ] ) as    @xmath72 \\label{s02}\\ ] ]    the entropy @xmath61 and the order parameter @xmath63 are plotted in fig . 1 as a function of the dilution coefficient @xmath17 .",
    "at the transition value @xmath73 , the first derivative of @xmath63 and the third derivative of the entropy are discontinuous .",
    "indeed , these results have an interesting interpretation in terms of random graph geography .",
    "in fact , at zero temperature , the magnetization is entirely due to the giant set ( continent ) of spins all connected , while the small sets of a single or a few interconnected spins isolated from the others ( islands ) can not contribute to the magnetization .",
    "since all spins in the continent must be directed in the same direction in order to minimize the ground state energy , their magnetization must be 1 and , therefore , their number must be @xmath74 .",
    "this also means that the total number of spins in the islands must be @xmath75 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath68 there is no continent ( @xmath76 ) and all the spin are in islands , on the contrary , all spins are in the continent only when @xmath77 ( in this limit @xmath78 ) .",
    "it is also possible to count the number of islands , in fact , any of the islands of connected spins can live only in two configurations : all spins up or all spins down .",
    "therefore , any island contribute by a @xmath79 to the ( intensive ) entropy .",
    "the continent also contributes by a single @xmath79 but this is irrelevant in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "therefore , the number of island is simply @xmath80 .",
    "let us call @xmath81 the number of islands of size @xmath82 ( islands made by a number @xmath83 of interconected spins which are isolated form all the others ) .",
    "then , the total number of islands can be written as @xmath84 . furthermore , since an island of size @xmath82 contains by definitions @xmath82 spins , the total number of spins in the islands can be written as @xmath85 .",
    "we have seen that the contribution of any island to the entropy is @xmath79 , therefore , we can write    @xmath86    analogously , since the total number of spins in all the islands is @xmath75 , we can write    @xmath87    we can also easily compute the average size @xmath0@xmath82@xmath2 of the islands ( the average number of spins per island ) since it is given by the ratio between the total number of spins in all the island @xmath85 divided by the number of islands @xmath88 .",
    "we obtain    @xmath89    the average size @xmath0@xmath82@xmath2 of the islands is plotted in fig .",
    "2 , notice that it has a maximum at the transition @xmath73 where it equals 2 .",
    "this means that the average dimension reaches a maximum when the continent begins to exist and then decreases because larger island are more easily absorbed by the continent .",
    "another simple consideration allows to compute the number of bonds @xmath90 in the islands . in fact , a moment of reflection shows that the number of islands forming loops is irrelevant in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "therefore the spins of an island of size @xmath82 must be connected by @xmath91 bonds which implies    @xmath92    since the total number of bonds is @xmath93 , we also have that number of bonds in the continent is @xmath94 .",
    "finally , we can compute the average number of bonds per spin in the islands as @xmath95 , while the average number of bonds per spin in the continent is @xmath96 .",
    "this two quantities are plotted in fig .",
    "2 . the average number of bonds per spin in the islands follows the average dimension of the island and it has a maximum in @xmath73 where it is the value 0.5 .",
    "this is coherent with the fact that an island of size two as a single bond .",
    "the average number of bonds per spin in the continent is defined only when @xmath67 because this the region where the continent exists . at @xmath97",
    "it has its minimal value 1 coherently with the fact that the any of the spin must be connected at least to another spin , which is , in turn connected to a third one and so on .    in next section",
    "we will consider again the case of vanishing temperature , but in presence of a magnetic field .",
    "this will allow for a better comprehension of the random graph geography .",
    "in fact , we will be able to compute all the @xmath98 , for the moment we just remark that the number @xmath99 of islands of size @xmath82 ( isolated spins ) is @xmath100 .",
    "this can be computed by considering that @xmath101 is the thermodynamical limit of @xmath102 which , in turn , is the probability that a spin has no positive bonds connecting to all the others .",
    "in the vanishing temperature limit one has @xmath103 and @xmath41 becomes    @xmath104 \\label{gtpottm}\\ ] ]    this is again a potts model whose solution can be found assuming that the @xmath4 densities @xmath5 have the form ( [ xpott ] ) .    with some simple algebra  @xcite we can compute the ground state internal energy @xmath105    @xmath106    while the entropy @xmath107 is    @xmath108 \\label{sd0}\\ ] ]    these two quantities obviously coincide with those computed in the previous section when @xmath109 , i.e. @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the maximum is reached in @xmath112 given by the equation    @xmath113    at variance with the 0 magnetic field case , this equation has a single non negative solution @xmath112 for any value of @xmath17 and , therefore , the transition disappears .",
    "also for this quantity one has by definition @xmath114 where @xmath63 is the zero magnetic field magnetization computed in previous section . using ( [ thetadc ] )",
    ", the entropy @xmath107 can be rewritten as    @xmath115 \\label{sd02}\\ ] ]    in fig .",
    "3 we plot the magnetization @xmath112 as a function of the dilution coefficient @xmath17 at three different values of the magnetic field concentration : @xmath109 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "one can easily remark the absence of transition for strictly positive values of @xmath39 .",
    "finally we compute the entropy response @xmath118 to magnetic concentration @xmath39 as    @xmath119    which gives    @xmath120    in order to use the above results to obtain more information concerning the geography of the random graph , we preliminarily observe that the difference between @xmath112 and @xmath63 is only due to the effect of the magnetic field on the islands while the magnetization of the spins of the continents remains unchanged and equal to 1 .",
    "the same can be said for what concerns the entropy , in fact , the contribution to the entropy coming from the continent remains equal to zero .",
    "it is easy to understand the effect of the magnetic field on a given island :",
    "if none of the component spins get a positive magnetic field , the island can still live in two configurations : all spins up or all spins down . for this reason its contribution to the entropy remains @xmath79 and the contribution to the magnetization remains equal to zero .",
    "but if one or more spins of the island get a positive magnetic field , then all spins of the island must be up , which implies that the contribution to the entropy vanishes and the contribution to the magnetization rises from 0 to @xmath121 where @xmath82 is the size of the island .",
    "the interesting point is that while magnetization @xmath74 has a geometrical interpretation , simply representing the number of spins in the continent , the magnetization @xmath122 is the sum of the number of spins in the continent plus the number of all spins in the islands frozen by the magnetic field .",
    "the entropy @xmath123 , on the contrary , is simply the number of unfrozen islands multiplied by @xmath124 .",
    "we notice that the probability that none of the spins of an island of size @xmath82 get a magnetic field is @xmath125 while the probability that at least one has a magnetic field is @xmath126 .",
    "the above arguments allow to say that the number of islands of size @xmath82 which are not frozen is @xmath127 .",
    "then , we are allowed to write    @xmath128    @xmath129    which coincide with the analogous quantities in previous section when @xmath109 .",
    "it is easy to verify that ( [ sa ] ) and ( [ ta ] ) are coherent with equation ( [ sigma ] ) for the entropy response .",
    "furthermore , they give much more information , in fact , expanding @xmath130 for small values of @xmath131 we have that the coefficients of the expansion are @xmath132 . as a consequence , we can have in principle all the density numbers @xmath98 of islands of size @xmath82 .",
    "in order to perform this expansion we can use iteratively equation ( [ thetadc ] ) and we obtain    @xmath133    while , in general , for any @xmath134 , one can deduce from ( [ thetadc ] ) the recursive formula    @xmath135    where the second sum goes on all the possible values of the @xmath136 strictly positive integer numbers @xmath137 which satisfy the constraint @xmath138 .",
    "this recursive formula gives @xmath139 indeed , we are not able to rigorously prove ( [ sal ] ) from ( [ al ] ) , nevertheless , we checked that it is exact for all @xmath82 between 2 and 10 .",
    "much more important , we were able to numerically compute @xmath140 and @xmath141 and verify that they coincide , respectively , with @xmath61 and @xmath142 .",
    "in particular @xmath141 equals 1 for any @xmath68 .",
    "notice that the expression @xmath143 was already found in previous section using very simple arguments .",
    "also notice that in the @xmath144 limit all @xmath98 vanish except @xmath145 which goes to 1 .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that in this limit all spins are isolated which means that only islands of size 1 exist .",
    "the description of the geography of the random graph is now completed , since we are able , for any value of @xmath17 , to give both the dimension of the continent @xmath63 and the number @xmath98 of islands of any fixed size .",
    "some relevant intuition about this geography can be obtained considering the islands index @xmath146 defined as @xmath147 which is the number of islands of size @xmath148 divided by the total number of islands .",
    "the index @xmath146 goes to 1 for large m. in fig.4 we plot this quantity for @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "the index approaches 1 for large values of @xmath151 but , for @xmath152 it is still about 0.94 when @xmath73 .",
    "the lower values of @xmath146 at @xmath73 mean that the largest islands appear around the transition .",
    "for a positive temperature , in absence of magnetic field , the free energy is given by ( [ bf ] ) once the proper maximum in ( [ psi ] ) is found .",
    "we have seen that in the case of vanishing temperature the exact solution can be found because the problem is equivalent to a potts model , on the contrary , for positive temperature , there is not an analogous equivalence .",
    "therefore , we have to find the correct parametrization of the @xmath5 making a decision motivated by the physics .",
    "first of all we remark that for positive temperature , the islands can not contribute to the magnetization , for the same reason why they do not contribute in the zero temperature case .",
    "in fact , being isolated clusters of spins , they can be orientated in both directions .",
    "so , we can already conclude that only the spins in the continent may contribute to the magnetization .",
    "let us assume that the magnetization of a spin in the continent is @xmath153 , then it is natural to assume that    @xmath154    where @xmath63 is the continent size given by ( [ thetac ] ) and @xmath155 is the parameter to be maximized .",
    "notice that the total magnetization is @xmath156 , being simply the product of the magnetization of a spin in the continent @xmath153 and their density @xmath63 .",
    "in fact ,    @xmath157    for any of the replicas , i.e. any @xmath158 .",
    "it is clear , at this point , that the really crucial ansatz is that the magnetization is a self - averaging quantity , otherwise we should chose an expression analogous to ( [ xtemp ] ) but with a different @xmath159 correspondingly to any @xmath49 .",
    "this breaking of the symmetry would have implied a different magnetization @xmath160 for any possible @xmath161 .",
    "with the choice ( [ xtemp ] ) we have @xmath162 , where    @xmath163 -\\sum_{\\sigma } x(\\sigma ) \\log ( x(\\sigma ) )   \\label{phitemp}\\ ] ]    and where @xmath5 is given by ( [ xtemp ] ) and the sum goes on all the @xmath4 possible realizations of @xmath29 .    in the zero temperature case ( @xmath46 ) and vanishing @xmath164",
    ", we can easily check that the maximum is reached in @xmath165 and we recover the zero temperature solution of section 2 .",
    "this check can be performed by simply verifying that the derivative with respect to @xmath153 of @xmath166 equals 0 when @xmath165 , @xmath46 and @xmath167 .    to find the proper maximum and",
    "perform the @xmath167 limit is much more difficult when the temperature is positive i.e. @xmath168 .",
    "the problem is that we were unable to find an analytic expression for any @xmath164 of the sum @xmath169 when @xmath170 . nevertheless , in order to find the behavior of the free energy in the paramagnetic region where @xmath171 and just around the transition where @xmath172 it is sufficient to expand @xmath173 with respect to @xmath153 .",
    "the minimum order of the expansion is the fourth , in fact , lower orders would be unable to provide a maximum .",
    "let us rewrite @xmath174 where @xmath175 , then notice that @xmath176 is a polynomial of @xmath153 with no terms of order 0 .",
    "then we can expand @xmath169 to the fourth order in @xmath176 , the approximate expression can be easily computed in a compact analytic form in terms of @xmath164 and @xmath153 and coincides with @xmath169 for all terms of order 4 or less of the expansion in @xmath153 .",
    "this analytic approximation can be inserted in ( [ phitemp ] ) replacing @xmath169 and we obtain an expression whose expansion coincides with that of @xmath166 up to terms of order 4 in @xmath153 . at this point , if we retain only these coinciding terms and we expand to order 1 in @xmath164 , we obtain    @xmath177 + n\\log(2 ) \\label{philambda}\\ ] ]    the maximum is reached in @xmath171 for @xmath178 and in @xmath179 given by    @xmath180    when @xmath181 .",
    "notice that in this region @xmath182 , therefore the denominator in ( [ lambda ] ) is larger then @xmath183 which , in turn , is larger then 0 .",
    "the conclusion is that the magnetization vanishes when @xmath178 and equals @xmath184 when @xmath181 which implies that we have exactly determined the transition line @xmath185 .    inserting ( [ lambda ] ) in ( [ philambda ] )",
    "we obtain    @xmath186    which gives the free energy in the low ( but not too low ) temperature region @xmath187 . on the contrary , inserting @xmath171 in ( [ philambda ] ) , we obtain    @xmath188    which gives the exact free energy in the high temperature region @xmath189 where the magnetization vanishes .    the free energy in the ferromagnetic region can be computed at any necessary precision in a straightforward manner , it is sufficient in fact to expand @xmath169 to the higher orders in @xmath153 .",
    "in fact , at any order , the expansion is a compact analytic expression of @xmath153 and @xmath164 .",
    "finally we remark that in the limit @xmath190 , @xmath77 and @xmath191 one recovers the fully connected mean field ising model . in this limit",
    ", our expansion gives @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 which is the mean field ising model solution in the same approximation .",
    "in this paper we obtained the exact solution of the dilute ising model in the case of a vanishing temperature even in presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the solution gives a complete description of the geography of the associated random graph , not only the size of the continent but also the number of isolated clusters of connected spins of all given size ( islands ) and the average number of bonds per spin both in the continent and in the islands .",
    "we were also able to find out the exact solution in the paramagnetic region and exactly determine the phase transition line . on the contrary , in the positive temperature ferromagnetic region ,",
    "our solution ( [ xtemp ] ) is the correct one only if the magnetization @xmath196 of the spins in the continent is self - averaging in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this assumption is not proven and the possibility that the magnetization has symmetry - broken characterization remains open , nevertheless , since at zero temperature there is not breaking and since the system is not frustrated , we are quite confident that our choice is correct .",
    "furthermore , the ferromagnetic free energy for positive temperature is only given in terms of an expansion with respect to the order parameter @xmath153 and , although the expansion can be made as accurate as necessary , the full and explicit free energy is still to be computed , if this is possible .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the present strategy can be straightforwardly applied to the dilute spin glass , but , unfortunately , it seems much more difficult to find analogous results .",
    "we are deeply grateful to michele pasquini for advices , suggestions and a critical reading of the manuscript which permitted many improvements .",
