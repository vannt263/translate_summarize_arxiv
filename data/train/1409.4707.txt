    "since the seventies , it is well known that the interaction between the induced atomic dipole moment and the intensity gradient of a non - resonant light enables the optical confinement of neutral atoms @xcite .",
    "nowadays , these optical dipole traps are routinely used to confine neutral atoms in the cold and ultracold regime where quantum - engineering is required .",
    "these confined atomic ensembles allow for a wide range of applications such as single atom manipulation  @xcite , bose - einstein condensation @xcite , optical atomic clocks @xcite or the observation of classical and quantum chaos  @xcite .",
    "the simplest optical trap providing confinement of neutral atoms consists of a single strongly focused gaussian laser beam @xcite . in this case , the confinement is one - dimensional and perpendicular to the propagation of the beam axis . for a tight confinement in the three spatial dimensions ,",
    "the so - called crossed - beam trap is commonly used which consists of two gaussian laser beams with orthogonal polarizations propagating along perpendicular directions @xcite . with this trap ,",
    "it is possible to obtain highly isotropic atomic ensembles tightly confined in all dimensions  @xcite .",
    "opposite to a bose - einstein condensate , for a thermal atomic cloud , quantum effects can be neglected and it is appropriate to describe the optical trapping mechanism via the corresponding classical dynamics of the atoms in the electromagnetic fields .",
    "indeed , the non - linear nature of the optical trapping renders these systems very attractive for classical studies . at the same time , such classical dynamics studies are scarce in the literature . in this sense , barker and",
    "coworkers @xcite used a classical one - dimensional model to explain the stark deceleration of a cold molecular beam by a single focussed laser beam .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to perform a systematic study of the classical dynamics of optically trapped neutral atoms .",
    "we also investigate the phase space of an atomic ensemble in free motion that is exposed to a suddenly switched on crossed optical dipole trap , and show that a certain fraction of the atoms are indeed trapped .",
    "the standard procedure of trapping neutral atoms relies on adiabatic processes , meaning that one first slows or even stops a particle beam and consequently traps it .",
    "the sudden trapping mechanism investigated here represents a highly non - adiabatic and instantaneous process .",
    "however , due to its in particular experimental simplicity ( there is no need of cooling techniques ) , this trapping procedure could be of interest .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in we establish the three degree of freedom hamiltonian governing the dynamics of an atom in a crossed - beam trap .",

    "most of the bounded trajectories are confined in chaotic regions because the regular kam tori regions have shrunken .",
    "we have investigated the nonlinear dynamics of an atom in a crossed optical dipole trap formed by two identical gaussian laser beams propagating along perpendicular directions .",
    "the evolution of the stability of the dynamics with increasing energy has been shown by a detailed analysis of the phase space in terms of two dimensional ofli@xmath74 maps . for small energies ,",
    "the phase space is populated with periodic and quasi periodic orbits , but chaotic motion appears as the energy is increased . above a certain threshold ,",
    "escape in both spatial ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) degrees of freedom becomes possible and the dynamics is of mixed regular and chaotic character .",
    "regular trajectories in which the atom quickly leaves the trap , and chaotic ones with very long escape times exist in this case . for energies close to zero",
    ", the threshold for escape in all three spatial directions , the phase space still presents small areas of trapped regular motion which are surrounded by a sea of chaotic scattering  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have explored the impact of an optical dipole trap , which is suddenly turned on , on an atomic beam that moves freely . independently of the initial direction of the atoms , we encounter that some of them remain within the trap , and the amount of trapped atoms decreases , as expected , as the initial atomic energy is increased .",
    "the majority of these trapped atoms have an energy larger than the escape channels , which can be understood in terms of the phase space structures .",
    "the ofli@xmath74 maps show that these trapped atoms are either in bounded orbits , which are possible due to the existence of kam tori , or in chaotic ones with very long escape times",
    ".    a natural extension of this work would be to investigate the dynamics following a quench .",
    "for an atomic ensemble in an optical dipole trap , a sudden change of the trap depth or width would provoke significant changes in the phase space structure . a classical study based on ofli@xmath74 maps",
    "would then characterize the escape dynamics and trapped population .",
