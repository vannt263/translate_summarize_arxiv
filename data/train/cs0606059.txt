    "_ dominoes _ , which use two squares , and _ tetrominoes _ ( the _ tetris _ pieces ) , which use four squares , are well known to game players .",
    "golomb first published a paper about polyominoes in _ the american mathematical monthly _",

    "a region is _ tiled _ with a given tile if it is completely covered by its copies without any overlap .",
    "several results about tiling regular shapes with polyominoes are mentioned by stanley and ardila @xcite , and do @xcite .",
    "many of the initial questions asked about polyominoes concern the number of _ n - ominoes _ ( those formed from @xmath8 squares ) , and what shapes can be tiled using just one of the polyominoes , possibly leaving one or two squares uncovered .",
    "in this paper we consider tilings of rectangles using 3-ominoes or _ trominoes _ of which there are two basic shapes , namely a @xmath9 rectangle and an l - shaped figure ( more commonly known as the _ right tromino _ ) . we restrict ourselves to tilings only with the right tromino . from now on , we will simply say _ tromino _ to mean the right tromino . in the past few years",

    "ash and golomb @xcite considered the problem of tiling a deficient rectangle .",
    "they characterized all positions of a square whose removal still permits a tromino tiling .",
    "their result is as follows :    * ( deficient rectangle theorem @xcite ) * an @xmath0 deficient rectangle , @xmath11 , @xmath14 , has a tiling , regardless of the position of the missing square , if and only if ( a ) neither side has length 2 unless both of them do , and ( b ) @xmath15 .",

    "2-deficient rectangle_. in this paper , we consider tromino tilings of a special class of 2-deficient rectangles , namely , the _ domino - deficient rectangles_. these are rectangles from which a domino has been removed .",
    "we characterize all cases of domino removal in such rectangles which do not permit a tromino tiling .",
    "it turns out that there are only 16 cases of domino removal which prevent a tiling for any @xmath0 rectangle , where @xmath16 and @xmath1 .",
    "these positions are @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and their symmetric counterparts ( viewed w.r.t .",
    "the other three corners ) . based on this characterization ,",
    "we design a procedure for constructing a tiling of a given domino - deficient rectangle if one exists .",

    "we also consider general 2-deficiency in @xmath6 rectangles , where @xmath7 , and characterize all pairs of squares which do not permit a tromino tiling .",
    "firstly , the reader should note that a @xmath21 rectangle can be tiled with trominoes ( as shown in figure 1(i)(a ) ) .",
    "we denote a rectangle with @xmath22 rows and @xmath23 columns by @xmath24",
    ". we will indicate decompositions into non - overlapping subrectangles by means of an additive notation .",
    "for example , a @xmath25 rectangle can be decomposed into @xmath26 subrectangles of dimension @xmath27 and we write this fact as @xmath28 .",
    "it follows from this and figure 1(i)(a ) that any @xmath29 or @xmath25 rectangle can be tiled with trominoes . for such rectangles",
    ", a very  trivial \" tiling rule would be to place @xmath21 or @xmath30 rectangles lengthwise . from now on ,",
    "any rectangle decomposed into a combination of @xmath25 subrectangles , @xmath29 subrectangles and trominoes will be considered as successfully tiled by trominoes .",
    "the square lying in row @xmath22 and column @xmath23 is denoted as @xmath31 . to make the notation simple ,",
    "trominoes are depicted , in the rest of the paper , as a composition of two lines forming an l - shape across an actual tromino ( as shown in figure 1(i)(b ) ) .",
    "domino - deficient rectangles with @xmath22 rows and @xmath23 columns are denoted in general by @xmath32 .",
    "all @xmath33 and @xmath34 rectangles are shown as gray - shaded rectangles labeled by the number @xmath35 , since they can be tiled in two ways ( as shown in figure 1(i)(c ) ) .",

    "the top left corner ) . for a given @xmath0 rectangle",
    ", we define a @xmath38-_hquad shift _ to be a process of detaching the leftmost ( rightmost ) @xmath39 columns and attaching an @xmath40 rectangle from the right ( left ) . for rectangles with no deficiency , such an operation has no meaning .",
    "however , for domino - deficienct rectangles , such an operation changes the position of the missing domino w.r.t .",
    "the top left corner of the rectangle , although size of the given rectangle remains the same .",
    "figure 1(iii ) shows a @xmath41-hquad shift for @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , for an @xmath0 rectangle , we define a @xmath43-_vquad shift _ to be a process of detaching the uppermost ( lowermost ) @xmath44 rectangle and attaching a @xmath44 rectangle from the bottom ( top ) . figure 1(ii ) shows a @xmath45-vquad shift for @xmath46 . we will use a vquad ( hquad ) shift to change an untileable configuration of a rectangle into a tileable one .",
    "the reader should note that we do not specify explicitly the direction associated with such shifts , however , the direction will be clear from the context , since we will only apply such shifts to rectangles where shifting is possible in exactly one direction .",
    "we present some elementary results for rectangles in section 2 , thereby giving an informal proof of the chu - johnsonbaugh theorem . in section 2.1",
    ", we present a special case of domino - deficiency , where a domino is removed from a corner of the given rectangle .",
    "we characterize all rectangles that admit such tilings .",
    "we then move on to consider general domino - deficient rectangles , where the position of the missing domino is no more restricted to a corner . for an @xmath0 domino - deficient rectangle to be tileable by trominoes , the resultant area @xmath47 must be divisible by 3 , i.e. , @xmath48(mod 3 ) . taking into consideration a rotation by one right angle we assume without loss of generality , that @xmath49(mod 3 ) and @xmath50(mod 3 ) .",
    "so , @xmath51 can assume the values @xmath52 , where @xmath5 , and @xmath8 can assume the values @xmath53 , where @xmath5 . since no tromino can fit in one row or column , @xmath54 .",
    "we present the entire analysis of characterizing bad cases of domino removal in @xmath0 rectangles in four exhaustive subcases as follows . in section 3 , we consider the simplest of these four cases , where we consider tiling a @xmath55 rectangle , where @xmath5 .",

    "we also consider counting tilings for such rectangles in section 4.1 , and derive the exact generating function . in section 5 , we characterize domino - deficiency in @xmath57 rectangles and then proceed to consider tilings in arbitrary @xmath0 domino - deficient rectangles in section 6 .",
    "we prove that there are only 16 bad cases of domino removal in any @xmath0 domino - deficient rectangle , where @xmath16 ; we also design a procedure for constructing such a tiling if one exists . in section 7",
    ", we derive an upper bound on the number of tromino tilings of arbitrary @xmath0 domino - deficient rectangles",
    ". finally , in section 8 , we present an approach to study general @xmath35-deficiency in rectangles and characterize all bad pairs for @xmath6 rectangles , where @xmath7 .",
    "first consider some rectangles that can not be tiled .",
    "we show by contradiction that a @xmath58 square @xmath59 can not be tiled .",
    "there are three possible ways of covering the square @xmath60 , as shown in figure 2(i)(a)-(c ) .",
    "orientation 2(i)(c ) is immediately ruled out , since square @xmath61 can not be tiled . in the cases 2(i)(a ) and",
    "( b ) , a feasible tiling must tile the leftmost @xmath30 subrectangle of @xmath59 , so that it is also a tiling of the third column @xmath62 of @xmath59 , a contradiction .",
    "similarly , one can show by contradiction that a @xmath63 rectangle @xmath64 can not be tiled .",
    "the above argument shows that a feasible tiling must tile the first two columns of @xmath64 , and hence , also the rightmost three columns of @xmath64 , a contradiction since we have just shown a @xmath58 square to be untileable .",
    "iterating this procedure , one can show that no @xmath65 can be tiled .",
    "it turns out that there are no other untileable rectangles with area divisible by 3 .",
    "consider the following three decompositions :    @xmath66    the reader should verify that any @xmath0 rectangle can be written in the form @xmath67 , @xmath68 or @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath11 , such that if one of @xmath51 and @xmath8 is 3 then the other is not odd",
    ". equations ( 1)-(3 ) show the corresponding tiling rules in each of these cases , the tiling of @xmath72 ( and hence @xmath73 ) is shown in figure 2(i)(d ) .",
    "note that apart from @xmath73 , each of the subrectangles obtained in equations ( 1)-(3 ) has dimensions @xmath74 or @xmath75 , where @xmath76 , and so is tileable .",
    "so we have an informal proof of the chu - johnsonbaugh theorem .",
    "we now consider tromino tilings of a special class of domino - deficient rectangles , namely , the _ domino - deficient dog - eared rectangles _",
    ", where a domino is removed from a corner of the given rectangle . in our present discussion , we assume that the domino was removed from the _ top right corner_. we will denote an @xmath0 domino - deficient dog - eared rectangle by @xmath36 . if this rectangle is rotated by @xmath77 radians , a similar figure with missing lower left - hand corner is created .",
    "if it is reflected about a central vertical ( resp . ,",
    "horizontal ) axis , a similar figure with missing lower right - hand ( resp .",
    ", upper left - hand ) corner is created .",
    "the problem of tiling the original figure is clearly equivalent to tiling any of the other six cases ( note that the missing domino can be either vertical or horizontal ) .",
    "we have the following result :    * [ domino - deficient dog - eared rectangle theorem ] * + @xmath36 can always be tiled by trominoes if a domino is removed from a corner , provided @xmath48(mod @xmath78 ) and @xmath79",
    ".    without loss of generality , assume @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where @xmath82 .",
    "set @xmath83 , and so @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where @xmath86 . in each of the cases shown we will break the given @xmath0 rectangle into subrectangles , which either satisfy the conditions of the chu - johnsonbaugh theorem @xcite , and so are tileable by trominoes , or are one among the cases shown in figures 2(ii)(a)-(d ) , in which case we apply the corresponding tiling shown in figure 2(ii ) .",
    "we first consider the cases when @xmath87 .",
    "when @xmath88 , we have only one case @xmath89 with @xmath71 . when @xmath90 , since 7 has different parity , in order to satisfy the criterions of the chu - johnsonbaugh theorem , we divide this case into two subcases , accordingly as @xmath39 is even or odd .",
    "so , we have to tile either @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 , or @xmath94 , where @xmath95 and @xmath93",
    ". there correspond these three decompositions :    @xmath96    for the algebraically inclined reader , these decompositions need no further explanation .",
    "however , the geometrically inclined reader should draw pictures to visualize them .",
    "( all the similar decompositions appearing below have straightforward geometrical interpretations . ) here , in the first two cases , a large rectangle was stripped from the left side of the figure . in the third case , a large rectangle was first stripped from the left side of the figure to obtain @xmath97 , from which the rectangle @xmath98 was removed from the bottom , to get @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath99 was then stripped from its left side to finally get @xmath100 .",
    "all the full rectangles are tileable since they satisfy the conditions of the chu - johnsonbaugh theorem , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are tiled as in figure 2(ii ) .",
    "we now consider the case when @xmath102 , where @xmath103 .",
    "since @xmath51 can have different parity , in order to satisfy the conditions of the chu - johnsonbaugh theorem , we divide the above case into two subcases accordingly as @xmath39 is even or odd .",
    "we have the following decompositions :    @xmath104    in these cases too , we strip the @xmath0 rectangle as above , obtaining @xmath100 ( tileable as in figure 2(ii)(a)-(b ) ) and full rectangles ; @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath99 , that satisfy the criterions of the chu - johnsonbaugh theorem , and so are tileable by trominoes .",
    "the reader should note that @xmath106 in equation ( 7 ) does not violate the conditions of the chu - johnsonbaugh theorem . since @xmath108",
    ", @xmath106 can never denote @xmath109 , which is untileable .",
    "a similar reasoning holds for the case when @xmath110 and @xmath111 , where @xmath82 , and so our result follows .",
    "we now consider general domino - deficient rectangles , where the position of the missing domino is no more restricted to a corner .",
    "we will denote an @xmath0 domino - deficient rectangle by @xmath36 . for an @xmath0 domino - deficient rectangle to be tileable by trominoes , the resultant area ( @xmath112 ) must be divisble by 3 , i.e. , @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath35(mod @xmath78 ) . taking into consideration a rotation by one right angle we assume without loss of generality , that @xmath115(mod 3 ) , and @xmath50(mod 3 ) .",

    "we present the entire analysis of characterizing bad cases of domino removal in @xmath0 rectangles in four exhaustive subcases as follows . in section 3",
    ", we consider tilings of @xmath118 rectangles , in section 4 , we consider tilings of @xmath119 rectangles , in section 5 , we consider tilings of @xmath120 rectangles , and finally in section 6 , we consider tilings of @xmath121 rectangles , where @xmath86 .",
    "we start with the simplest of the four cases of domino - deficiency enumerated in the previous section , namely , when one dimension of the given @xmath0 rectangle ( say @xmath51 ) is 2 .",
    "first consider tromino tilings of @xmath122 rectangles instead of domino - deficient @xmath3 rectangles , where @xmath123 .",
    "consider the orientations of the tromino covering @xmath61 ( as shown in figure 3(a)-(b ) ) .",
    "if it covers @xmath124 ( see figure 3(a ) ) then a @xmath21 rectangle ( @xmath34 ) is completed by the tromino covering @xmath125 , and if it covers @xmath125 ( see figure 3(b ) ) then @xmath34 is completed by the tromino covering @xmath124 .",
    "so , any tiling of @xmath126 consists of a tiling of @xmath34 on the leftmost side followed by a tiling of @xmath127 ( see figure 3(c ) ) .",
    "let @xmath128 denote the number of tromino tilings of @xmath126 .",
    "taking @xmath34 as the basis case and performing induction on @xmath129 , using the above argument in the inductive step , we conclude that @xmath130 .",
    "we state this result in the following lemma :    the number of tromino tilings of a @xmath122 rectangle , @xmath130 .",
    "we now consider tromino tilings of @xmath131 rectangles , where @xmath123 .",
    "consider the situation when the removed domino is vertical ( see figure 3(e ) ) .",
    "this domino divides the given @xmath3 rectangle into two subrectangles .",
    "these two smaller subrectangles must be completely tileable by trominoes , since each tromino occupies an area of 3 , so the area of both these rectangles must be divisible by 3 .",
    "so , we conclude that a vertical domino can be removed only from the columns @xmath132 , where @xmath71 .",
    "now consider the case when a horizontal domino is removed from @xmath133 . without loss of generality , assume that it is present in the @xmath134 row and occupies @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the reader can easily see that the only way of covering @xmath137 and @xmath138 is as shown in figure 3(d ) .",
    "again , we get two smaller rectangles which must be tileable by trominoes .",
    "we conclude that there areas must also be divisible by 3 .",
    "so , the only possible values of @xmath139 , where @xmath140 .",
    "we summarize these results in the following theorem :    * [ domino - deficient direc theorem ] * in case of a vertical domino removal from @xmath141 , the remaining area permits a tromino tiling if and only if the missing domino occupies the position @xmath142 , where @xmath71 . in case of a horizontal domino removal from @xmath141 , the remaining area permits a tiling if and only if the missing domino occupies either the position @xmath143 or the position @xmath144 , where @xmath140 .      apart from proving existence of tilings for @xmath131 rectangles , @xmath123 ,",
    "the domino - deficient direc theorem is also constructive in nature .",
    "this fact can also be used for counting the number of tromino tilings of @xmath133 with @xmath145 trominoes and one domino .",
    "let @xmath146 denote this number .",
    "first consider the case when the removed domino is vertical and let @xmath147 be the number of tilings in this case . from the domino - deficient direc theorem , the domino can only occupy the columns @xmath132 , where @xmath71 .",
    "so the two smaller rectangles on either side are @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "using this fact and lemma 1 , we immediately arrive at the recurrence :    @xmath150    now consider the case when the removed domino is horizontal and let @xmath151 denote the number of tilings in this case .",
    "the domino - deficient direc theorem states that the removed domino can only occupy the pair of columns @xmath152 , where @xmath140",
    ". so the smaller rectangles on either side are @xmath153 and @xmath154",
    ". the removed domino can be either in the @xmath134 or the @xmath155 row , introducing an additional factor of 2 . from the above conditions and lemma 1",
    ", we get the following recurrence :    @xmath156    the removed domino can be either horizontal or vertical .",
    "so , from ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , we conclude that @xmath157 . we summarize this result in the following theorem :    the number of tromino tilings of @xmath131 , where @xmath123 , is @xmath158    the reader may think that this result is surprising and contrary to his expectations . just by removing a domino from the @xmath159 rectangle , the complexity of the number of tromino tilings changes from @xmath160 to @xmath161 ,",
    "although our intuition says that adding deficiency should be pretty restrictive on the orientations of some trominoes , and so the number of tilings should decrease !",
    "the catch lies in observing that the size of the rectangle being considered also increases ( from @xmath126 to @xmath133 ) , so the number of trominoes remains the same , i.e. , @xmath145 .",
    "moreover , we also take into account all permissible positions of the missing domino .",
    "consider the second case when one dimension of the given @xmath0 rectangle ( say @xmath51 ) is 4 .",
    "the bad pairs for the case @xmath162 will be enumerated separately in another section , so for now we will assume that @xmath7 .",
    "see figure 4 . the bad pairs for @xmath42 have been indicated by dark squares .",
    "it turns out that these are the only pairs that do not permit a tromino tiling . as the reader can see",
    ", the pairs of squares @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath163 , @xmath20 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 make the cornermost squares @xmath168 inaccessible , and so , do not permit a tromino tiling .",
    "now consider the four pairs @xmath19 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 . in the pair @xmath19 the tromino covering @xmath172",
    "makes the square @xmath61 inaccessible .",
    "similarly , in the case of the pairs @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 the trominoes covering @xmath173 , @xmath41 , and @xmath174 make the squares @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 inaccessible .",
    "so , we conclude that these pairs are also bad ( refer figure 5(ii ) ) . finally , consider the pairs @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "since the two pairs are symmetric ( reflections of each other in the vertical axis ) , we need only consider the badness of @xmath178 .",
    "if the tromino covering @xmath172 covers @xmath180 , then the square @xmath61 becomes inaccessible .",
    "so this tromino must cover @xmath181 ( see figure 5(i ) ) .",
    "similarly , the tromino covering @xmath41 must cover @xmath182 .",
    "but now we have isolated a @xmath183 rectangle which does not satisfy the conditions of the chu - johnsonbaugh theorem , and so is untileable .",
    "we conclude that the pairs @xmath178 and @xmath179 are also bad .",
    "we are now ready to prove the following theorem :    * [ domino - deficient quadrec theorem ] * the only bad pairs for @xmath56 are @xmath18 , @xmath17 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath163 , @xmath20 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath178 , @xmath188 , @xmath19 , @xmath189 , @xmath170 and @xmath190 .",
    "the proof for the badness of the cases of domino - removal enumerated in the theorem statement is similar to that for @xmath42 , and so is left for the reader as an exercise .",

    "consider tilings of @xmath56 , where @xmath123 .",
    "this big domino - deficient rectangle can be viewed as @xmath129 subrectangles of dimension @xmath191 and one domino - deficient @xmath42 rectangle joined together .",
    "following our additive notation , we write this as :    @xmath192    if the missing domino in the rectangle @xmath42 does not form a bad pair , then we can tile it .",
    "a @xmath191 rectangles satisfies the conditions of the chu - johnsonbaugh theorem , and so is tileable .",
    "so , in this case , we achieve a tiling of @xmath56 .",
    "consider the situation when the missing domino in @xmath42 ( as above ) forms a bad pair .",
    "in this case , we perform a @xmath41-_hquad shift_. the reader should note that we are only considering pairs of squares which are not enumerated in the theorem statement , so such a shift is always possible . if such a shift removes the  badness \" of @xmath42 , then we are done .",
    "the only case in which a @xmath41-hquad shift will not work , is when @xmath42 has @xmath178 or @xmath179 as its bad pair .",
    "these pairs are symmetric with respect to a shift by three columns , and so just get interchanged . in this case , we join a removed @xmath191 rectangle from the left ( or right ) as shown in figure 5(iv ) .",
    "the new rectangle @xmath193 is tileable ( as is evident from the figure ) .",
    "each of the @xmath194 subrectangles of dimension @xmath191 is also tileable , so we get a tiling of @xmath56 .",

    "the reader must note that not every domino tiling of @xmath381 is obtained by stretching a monodic tiling of @xmath374 .",
    "note , for example , the domino tiling of @xmath382 shown in figure 11(2 ) .",
    "the reader can verify that this domino tiling can not be obtained by stretching ( either horizontally or vertically ) any monodic tiling of @xmath33 .",
    "now let us define our operations in case of an @xmath0 domino - deficient rectangle .",
    "similar to a monodic tiling , we define a _",
    "deficient monodic tiling _ for an @xmath0 domino - deficient rectangle , as a tiling with @xmath383 dominoes and @xmath384 monominoes .",
    "while converting a tromino tiling of the given rectangle to a directed monodic tiling , we just do nt attach any direction with the missing domino .",
    "we call the resulting tiling a _",
    "deficient directed monodic tiling_. the reader can easily see that a deficient directed monodic tiling can be converted back to the original domino - deficient tromino tiling by the same procedure described above ( the missing domino is simply left untouched ) .",
    "if we mutiply the total number of deficient monodic tilings of @xmath374 by @xmath385 , we get the total number of deficient directed monodic tilings of @xmath374 .",
    "first , let us focus only on the case when the stretching done is horizontal .",
    "with slight modification , the original streching procedure can also be converted to a one - to - one mapping function which converts every deficient monodic tiling of @xmath374 to a domino tiling of @xmath381 .",
    "we call a domino tiling of @xmath381 _ valid _ if it was obtained by stretching a deficient monodic tiling of @xmath374",
    ". any valid domino tiling can be converted back to a deficient monodic tiling of @xmath374 simply by _ unstretching _",
    "( i.e. , compressing lengthwise ) the valid domino tiling of @xmath381 .",
    "suppose we have a deficient monodic tiling of @xmath374 .",
    "colour _ this tiling in the following manner , every monomino is coloured _ blue _ and every domino is coloured _",
    "we now stretch @xmath374 length - wise to produce @xmath381 . the outcome will be a _ coloured _ domino tiling of @xmath381 .",
    "note that the dominoe(s ) produced by the stretching of a coloured monomino ( domino ) will be of the same colour as that of the monomino ( domino ) . and",
    "similarly , we define the unstretching of a coloured domino tiling .",
    "we have the following lemma .",
    "distinct coloured deficient monodic tilings of @xmath374 give rise to distinct coloured domino tilings of @xmath381 .",
    "we prove the above claim by the method of contradiction .",
    "we assume on the contrary that the above claim is false .",
    "first suppose that two distinct coloured deficient monodic tilings of @xmath374 give rise to the same coloured domino tiling of @xmath381 via stretching .",
    "since the two monodic tilings of @xmath374 being considered are distinct , we know that the position of at least one monomino is different in these two tilings .",
    "this means that the position of a monomino in the first tiling of @xmath374 is covered by a domino in the second tiling of @xmath374 .",
    "let this monomino be @xmath31 .",
    "it can be easily seen that after stretching of @xmath374 , the squares @xmath386 and @xmath387 correspond to the square @xmath31 in @xmath374 .",
    "these two squares in @xmath381 will be covered by a blue domino via the first monodic tiling and a red domino via the second .",
    "but this is impossible because both the coloured deficient monodic tilings of @xmath374 being considered give rise to the same coloured domino tiling of @xmath381 .",
    "thus , we arrive at a contradiction .",
    "now suppose that two distinct coloured domino tilings of @xmath381 give rise to the same coloured deficient monodic tiling of @xmath374 after unstretching .",
    "again , since the two coloured domino tilings are distinct , the position of at least one square @xmath31 ( say ) in one domino tiling is covered by a red ( blue ) domino and which is covered by a blue ( red ) domino in the other .",
    "the reader can see that after unstretching the rectangle @xmath381 , each square @xmath31 in @xmath381 maps to @xmath388)$ ] in @xmath374 ( here [ x ] represents the integer part of x ) .",
    "when we unstretch the two coloured tilings , this means that the square @xmath388)$ ] in @xmath374 , corresponding to the square @xmath31 in @xmath381 , will be red ( blue ) via the first tiling and blue ( red ) via the second tiling .",
    "thus , we again arrive at a contradiction .",
    "so , we conclude that distinct coloured deficient monodic tilings of @xmath374 map to distinct coloured domino tilings of @xmath381 .",
    "we have already shown that not all domino tilings of @xmath381 are valid .",
    "thus , via the two mappings just described above , we have defined an injective function from the set of domino - deficient tromino tilings of @xmath36 to a proper subset of coloured domino tilings of @xmath381 .",
    "since the direction of stretching is unimportant in the above arguments , the reader should convince himself that the above claims also hold for vertical stretching of rectangles .",
    "the number of coloured domino tilings of @xmath381 is simply @xmath389 times the number of domino tilings of @xmath381 ( since every domino can be coloured either red or blue ) .",
    "let @xmath390 and @xmath373 , denote the number of tromino tilings of @xmath36 and the number of domino tilings of @xmath374 . from a given tromino tiling of an @xmath0 domino - deficient rectangle",
    ", we can get at most @xmath391 deficient directed monodic tilings , where @xmath39 is the number of deficient monodic tilings of the given rectangle . from each tiling thus obtained , we can get a unique coloured domino tiling of @xmath381 , of which there are at most @xmath392 of them .",
    "we summarize these arguments in the following theorem :    for all rectangles @xmath374 , such that @xmath1 and @xmath375 , the following inequality holds : @xmath393\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the number of domino tilings of @xmath377 is given by the formula ,    @xmath378    the upper bound derived above shows that the number of tilings of an @xmath0 domino - deficient rectangle is at most exponential in both @xmath51 and @xmath8 .",
    "so , the number of binary bits required in encoding any tiling of the rectangle is upper bounded by a polynomial in @xmath51 and @xmath8 .",
    "now consider general @xmath35-deficiency in rectangles . in this section , we denote @xmath35-deficient @xmath0 rectangles by @xmath36 .",
    "general @xmath35-deficiency as such is a lot more complicated than domino - deficiency , and till date no characterizations exist for any classes of rectangles . in this paper ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to studying general @xmath35-deficiency in @xmath6 rectangles .",
    "for a few examples of the bad pairs for the case when one dimension of the given @xmath0 rectangle , say @xmath90 see @xcite .",
    "apart from the bad pairs shown in figure 4 of section 4 , figure 12 shows all bad pairs for @xmath394 .",
    "we encourage the reader to try placing trominoes on @xmath394 with the @xmath35-deficiencies shown in figure 12 , and verify for himself that the pairs shown are actually bad .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath395 , where @xmath5 , the corresponding analogues of the pairs shown in figure 12 are the only bad pairs .",
    "we prove this fact in the following theorem :    the only bad pairs ( apart from those enumerated in section @xmath396 ) for @xmath395 , where @xmath5 , are those corresponding to the pairs in figure 12 .    we leave the proof of the badness of the pairs shown in figure 12 for the reader .",
    "we prove the existence of a tiling in all other cases .",
    "first consider the case when there exist two distinct @xmath397 squares such that each square contains exactly one missing square , and the remaining area of @xmath398 can be divided into @xmath382 rectangles .",
    "following our additive decomposition notation , we can decompose @xmath395 as shown in equation ( 33 ) .",
    "a @xmath399 rectangles satisfies the conditions of the chu - johnsonbaugh theorem , and so is tileable , while @xmath400 is tileable since it satisfies the conditions of the deficient rectangle theorem .",
    "it follows from above that @xmath395 can be tiled in this case .",
    "@xmath401    we now consider the case when the position of the two missing squares does not permit the decomposition in the former case .",
    "it is easy to see that in this case , we can decompose @xmath395 as shown in ( 34 ) .",
    "if the missing squares in @xmath394 do not form a bad pair , then we are done .",
    "otherwise , the missing squares form one of the bad pairs shown in figure 12 . in this case",
    ", we join a removed @xmath399 rectangle from the top ( bottom ) , and apply the corresponding tiling rule among the various cases shown in figure 13 .",
    "so , in this case , we tile @xmath402 as shown , and separately tile @xmath194 subrectangles of dimension @xmath399 , to get a tiling of @xmath395 .",
    "we are currently exploring general 2-deficiency in rectangles and wish to characterize bad pairs for arbitrary @xmath0 rectangles .",
    "the proof of the last theorem is particularly important because it suggests an approach for solving general @xmath35-deficiency in large rectangles .",
    "when the missing squares are far apart , the given rectangle can be broken down into two subrectangles , such that each subrectangle contains exactly one missing square .",
    "now the deficient rectangle theorem may be used to find a tiling rule , if one exists .",
    "however , one would have to consider certain cases as  basis \" cases , before using the above argument , as we did in the proof of the domino - deficient rectangle theorem in section 6 .",
    "we observed that the number of bad pairs for these  basis \" cases is extremely large .",
    "so , analysis using existing techniques becomes extremely complicated .",
    "moreover , showing non - existence of a tiling by this method seems to be rather hard .",
    "we believe that enumeration of bad pairs may be analysed by studying possible transformations that map between classes of bad pairs .",
    "the hquad and vquad shifts are examples of such transformations , however , they can not generate _ all _ bad pairs starting from a single one .",
    "furthermore , as a sequel to 2-deficiency problems , one may also consider the question of @xmath39-deficiency , for @xmath403 .",
    "another research direction would be to establish a lower bound on the number of tromino tilings of @xmath0 domino - deficient rectangles ; it is an interesting open problem to determine whether there exists a lower bound comparable to our upper bound derived in inequality ( 31 ) , section 7 .",
    "no such lower bounds have been established till date . partitioning schemes such as the one used in the domino - deficient tiling procedure in section 6 ,",
    "lead to lower bounds on the number of tilings of the entire rectangle obtained by multiplying lower bounds on the number of tilings for each part .",
    "devising partitioning schemes that lead to good lower bounds is an interesting open problem .",
