    "many models of galaxy formation and evolution in recent years take as a reference for the observational side the results coming from qso absorption studies and in particular those objects that show a large hi column density , namely , the damped lyman@xmath0 systems ( dlas ) with @xmath9 atoms 2 ( see for example pei et al .",
    "dlas have been widely studied both because they are believed to be the progenitors of present day galaxies and because the large hi column density allows one to probe the chemical enrichment problem .",
    "dlas constitute so far the best laboratory where to directly measure the heavy element enrichment in a large interval of evolutionary phases , and to understand the processes of star formation and metal pollution of the universe .",
    "however , this kind of investigation requires a careful consideration of the effects of dust depletion suffered by dlas ( pei et al .",
    "1991 ; pettini et al .",
    "we present the analysis of a sample of   dlas in the redshift range @xmath1 to investigate their chemical state .",
    "we find that , after allowance for dust depletion corrections which are obtained with a very general approach , the dla population clearly shows a metallicity  redshift evolution .",
    ".mean element abundances relative to hydrogen [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we have collected data from the literature for a dla sample , which includes  objects . this sample represents the largest and most complete sample of dlas for which measurements of hi and heavy  element column densities are available .",
    "the ions considered for abundance measurements are feii , znii , crii , siii , mnii , sii , niii .",
    "these ions are the dominant contributors to the abundances of the corresponding elements in hi clouds with high column densities , because they all have ionization potentials below 13.6  ev .    in table",
    "1 we give the mean metal abundances relative to hydrogen and iron . they are presented with the customary definition [ x / h]@xmath12 , where x@xmath13 and y@xmath13 are the ion column densities of element x and y. for comparison , the mean abundances for warm halo ( wh ) clouds ( savage and sembach 1996 ) and the small magellanic cloud ( smc , welty et al .",
    "1997 ) are also shown .",
    "we note that globally dlas show [ x / h ] and [ x / fe ] abundance ratios more similar to those of smc and wh clouds , respectively .",
    "this suggests that metal abundances in dlas are the result of chemical enrichment processes similar from the ones operating in the smc and that the most common depletion pattern operating in dlas is similar to the one observed in wh clouds .    indeed , to derive a complete picture of the dla chemical state ,",
    "one must correct for dust depletion effects . since every element considered is affected by dust depletion differently , one must consider all measured species simultaneously . in the milky way ,",
    "a number of depletion patterns have been identified , showing highest depletions in dense disk clouds and lowest depletions in low density , warm halo clouds ( savage & sembach 1996 ) .",
    "we make a simplification assuming that the depletion patterns in dlas may be reproduced by one of the four depletion patterns identified for the mw : warm halo , warm halo + disk ( whd ) , warm disk ( wd ) and cool disk ( cd ) clouds ( savage & sembach 1996 ) , thus modifying the dust  to  metals ratio to obtain the best match with the observations . by means of a @xmath2 minimization procedure",
    "we determine the best fit dla metallicities and the dust  to  metals ratios .    fig .",
    "1 shows the metallicity as a function of redshift .",
    "filled symbols represent dlas with three or more measured elemental abundances for which it has been possible to obtain a proper best fit solution ( 37 dlas ) . for the cases with only two elements",
    "observed , each fit has a zero formal error and , therefore , a reduced @xmath2 can not be calculated ; thus , the best fit is considered less significant ( 16 dlas , empty symbols and solid error bars ) . finally , for the cases where only one element is measured",
    ", we estimate the metallicity assuming a wh depletion pattern ( 16 dlas , empty symbols and dotted error bars ) . the combination of the largest sample available (   dlas )",
    ", a large redshift baseline ( @xmath14 ) and a more accurate dust correction applied have led to the unambiguous detection of the redshift evolution of metallicity in dla galaxies , with mean values around 1/30 of solar at @xmath4 to 3/5 of solar at @xmath6 .",
    "we found a significant linear correlation of metallicity with redshift ( 99.99% significance level ) with a slope of @xmath15 , which is clearly not consistent with a null gradient , indicating genuine evolution of dla metallicity with redshift . in fig .  1 we also show six boxes centered on the weighted averages over @xmath16 intervals and whose vertical widths mark the corresponding @xmath17 weighted dispersion . in addition",
    ", we note that the vertical dispersion of points greatly exceeds the total errors , indicating that , although all dlas align along an average trend , there are real differences among individual objects in either initial conditions , or time of formation , or metal enrichment efficiency , or all of the above .",
    "pei & fall ( 1995 ) consider that a mean heavy  element abundance in the interstellar medium of dla galaxies is given by the ratio of the total metal content to the total gas content ( i.e. @xmath18 ) , which means that large hi dlas dominate when calculating the global metallicity .",
    "this kind of analysis has been performed on a sample of dlas using the znii absorption line and a null result has been found for the evolution ( pettini et al .",
    "1999 ) , and it is not disproved if our sample is used",
    ". however , the lack of evident evolution in this case appears to be due to the fact that those dlas with large hi column density are concentrated in the central redshift region ( 84% of dlas with @xmath19 are in the bin @xmath20 ) . in other words , we can not exclude the redshift evolution of metallicity in high hi dlas till when the considered sample will be fairly distributed in the considered redshift range .",
    "if there were a metallicity evolution also for high hi dlas , dust obscuration could be too large at @xmath21 to make dlas detectable ( a dla with @xmath22 and metallicity @xmath23 would extinct about 1.5 magnitude in the ly@xmath0 ) .",
    "moreover , this is where uv observations , required to detect ly@xmath0 absorption , are very sensitive to any appreciable dust opacity .",
    "in 37 dlas for which we have obtained a best fit solution , we have found that the majority ( @xmath24% ) show a wh  like depletion pattern , then @xmath25% and @xmath26% have a whd  like and wd  like depletion pattern , respectively .",
    "the predominance of wh  like conditions may be interpreted as evidence for a lower density in the absorbing clouds relative to clouds in the mw disk and/or to more efficient dust destruction processes operating in dla galaxies , possibly due to more active star formation that may produce a more turbulent , dust hostile environment . in our sample",
    "there are 31 dlas with measured si and for which it has to perform @xmath2 minimization . for 8 over 31 systems",
    ", there is evidence of deviation of si with respect the expectations , having a mean value of @xmath27 .",
    "no correlation with redshift and metallicity is revealed .",
    "this result may be indicative of @xmath0element enrichment in a fraction of dlas , or of a lower efficiency of silicate formation than is found in the milky way .",
    "we like to stress that it is the combination of a large sample of dlas (  objects ) , a wide redshift baseline ( @xmath14 ) and a more accurate dust correction applied to all heavy  elements measured , that has allowed us to demonstrate that the metallicity of dlas evolves with redshift .",
    "the combined use of as many elements as possible allows one to much more efficiently track the metallicity evolution down to very metal poor gas clouds ."
