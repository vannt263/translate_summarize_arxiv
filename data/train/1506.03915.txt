    "beta - delayed particle emission is an important decay mode for exotic nuclei and allows many aspects of nuclear structure to be probed , see the two recent reviews @xcite for a comprehensive overview .",
    "we report here the first observation of @xmath4 emission as well as the rare @xmath3p@xmath1 emission from the nucleus @xmath2 mg . based on these observations",
    "we have identified systematic patterns in the occurence of beta - delayed particle decays in proton - rich nuclei .",
    "we shall present and discuss these as well .",
    "a detailed description of beta - delayed particle emission must include consideration of local nuclear structure effects , but its occurence is in general dominated by the available energy , i.e.  the difference between the @xmath5-value and the particle separation energy .",
    "as is well known , for an isobaric chain with mass number @xmath6 the @xmath5 values will increase and the proton and neutron separation energies decrease as one moves from the beta stability line towards the driplines ( modulated for even @xmath6 by the pairing term ) .",
    "the @xmath1 particle separation energy tends for light nuclei to be minimal for @xmath7 nuclei , but the minimum moves towards more proton rich nuclei and reaches the proton dripline at @xmath8 .",
    "this causes a clear pattern for beta - delayed multi - particle emission , with @xmath32p and @xmath33p taking place close to the proton dripline , @xmath32n , @xmath33n etc starting from about halfway to the neutron dripline , while @xmath32@xmath1 is seen from @xmath9 nuclei close to stability .",
    "( to the extent that these decays are sequential one can of course regard them as @xmath4 decays to the unstable @xmath10 nuclei . )",
    "similar patterns appear in beta - delayed single - particle emission although exceptions occur for the very light nuclei such as the large @xmath11 values for @xmath12 nuclei and the @xmath4 emission from neutron - rich n - isotopes .",
    "we focus first on the multi - particle @xmath3p@xmath1 decay and return in the discussion to the general patterns of beta - delayed particle emission .",
    "the @xmath2 mg activity was produced at the isolde facility at cern by a 1.4 gev proton beam impinging upon a sic target .",
    "the produced atoms were extracted , laser ionized , accelerated to 60 kev , led through a mass separator into the experimental set - up , and implanted in the window of a gas - si telescope opposed by a si(dsssd)-si telescope . a full account of the experimental procedure is given in @xcite .",
    "the collected source also contained a substantial amount of @xmath2na .",
    "the data from the gas - si charged particle telescope are presented as a @xmath13-@xmath14 spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : bananaplot ] . rescaled stopping powers @xcite for @xmath1 particles and protons ( evaluated for silicon , but representing the total energy loss in the collection foil , the gas detector and the si dead layer ) are drawn in the figure and match the data well , indicating the presence of @xmath4 decays on top of the previously established @xcite @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath3-particle component in the lower left corner of fig .",
    "[ fig : bananaplot ] overlaps with protons below 1150 kev and @xmath1-particles below 700 kev making particle identification difficult at low energy .",
    "the @xmath1-particles are stopped in the dsssd and can not be separated there from the more intense proton branches .    the @xmath1-particle spectrum extracted from the gas - telescope by applying the gate drawn as a dashed black closed line in fig.[fig : bananaplot ]",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphaspectrum ] . apart from a remaining background component at low energy five @xmath1 branches can be identified in the spectrum .",
    "the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 lines naturally fit into the @xmath2 mg scheme put forward in @xcite as @xmath3-delayed single @xmath1 branches ( see @xcite for the full decay scheme ) . the @xmath20 line , with measured laboratory energy 714(12 ) kev , does not fit with a transition between known levels in @xmath2na and @xmath21f .",
    "however , it does agree with a known @xmath1-particle transition from @xmath22ne to @xmath23o observed in the decay of @xmath22na @xcite with a laboratory energy of 714(4 ) kev .",
    "a conclusive particle identification for @xmath20 was not possible from the @xmath13-@xmath14 plot , but strong support for the above assignment comes from the observation of a coincident line in the dsssd detector , assigned to be the preceding proton .",
    "this proton branch p@xmath24 ( the numbering is chosen to be consistent with the full data set discussed in @xcite ) is displayed as the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphaspectrum ] . from the measured energy we deduce @xmath25(p@xmath24 )",
    "= 919(18 ) kev which leads to the interpretation of @xmath20 and p@xmath24 as being due to @xmath3p@xmath1 decay of @xmath2 mg through the @xmath26 isobaric analogue state ( ias ) at 8.975 mev in @xmath2na via proton emission to the 5.621 mev @xmath27 level in @xmath22ne and finally @xmath1 emission to the ground state of @xmath23o .",
    "the total branching ratio of this decay branch is found to be @xmath28 .",
    "this proton branch from the ias has not been observed earlier and @xmath1-emission from excited states of @xmath2na have only been reported in one earlier experiment @xcite .      as mentioned above our data",
    "are contaminated by @xmath2na , other small contaminants could in principle also be present . the observed @xmath4 and @xmath3p@xmath1 branches are quite weak , so a cross - check of the assignment is valuable .",
    "this is done by considering the time distribution of the events .",
    "several factors influence the time distribution of the recorded @xmath2 mg events , see @xcite for an exhaustive discussion",
    ". we shall use as reference the experimental time distribution recorded for events within the proton gate in figure [ fig : bananaplot ] and with energy above 1150 kev .",
    "the energy gate ensures that the reference distribution only contains protons from the decay of @xmath2 mg .",
    "the halflives of @xmath2 mg and @xmath2na , 122(2 ) ms and 22.49(4 ) s @xcite , differ greatly as do the corresponding time distributions .",
    "other contaminants are also expected to differ from @xmath2 mg . some of the @xmath4 branches have quite low statistics and we therefore compare their time distribution directly to the reference distribution .",
    "this can be done very efficiently with the empirical distribution function ( edf ) statistics @xcite that give powerful goodness - of - fit tests .",
    "the basic principle is to compare the shape of the data sample to the reference shape by measuring the distance between the two cumulated distributions . for experimental and reference distributions with values @xmath29 and @xmath30 in bin @xmath31 ,",
    "the three most frequently used edf statistics are @xcite kolmogorov - smirnov @xmath32 cramer - von mises @xmath33 and anderson - darling @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the total number of counts and @xmath36 is the probability to be in bin @xmath31 in the reference distribution . the second column of table [ tab : timeresult ] gives the 95% confidence levels for the three edf statistics obtained through monte carlo simulation , values below these levels indicate the time distribution for the different lines are consistent with the one of @xmath2 mg .",
    "more details on the confidence levels are given in @xcite .",
    "cc|ccccc & 95% c.l . &",
    "p@xmath24 & @xmath20 & @xmath37 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 + d & 1.31 & 1.22 & 1.64 & 0.64 & 1.08 & 0.81 + w@xmath38 & 0.46 & 0.33 & 0.41 & 0.05 & 0.33 & 0.12 + a@xmath38 & 2.49 & 1.46 & 3.61 & 0.64 & 1.73 & 0.80 +    the edf test results in table [ tab : timeresult ] show that all lines , except for @xmath20 , agree with the reference distribution .",
    "the agreement is particularly good for the strongest line , @xmath17 . as mentioned above",
    "there is a contamination of @xmath3-particles in @xmath20 that come from both @xmath2na and @xmath2 mg .",
    "we would therefore expect the time distribution for @xmath20 to be mainly that of @xmath2 mg with a small component of @xmath2na .",
    "the edf tests are sufficiently sensitive to see the effect of the small @xmath2na contribution .",
    "we expect , and do observe , that the upper part of the @xmath20 distribution has smaller contamination level .",
    "the fact that the coincident p@xmath24 distribution is consistent with being from @xmath2 mg implies that we can safely assign the @xmath3p@xmath1 transition , as well as all @xmath4 transitions , to the decay of @xmath2 mg .",
    "the @xmath3p@xmath1 decay mode is very rare as described in @xcite with only two previously established cases : @xmath39c and @xmath21ne . for two further candidates , @xmath40o and @xmath41si , the decay mode has not been seen so far .",
    "most searches have concentrated on seeing particle emission from the ias in the beta - daughter due to the large beta - strength to this state .",
    "the case of @xmath39c is special in that all states populated in the beta - daughter @xmath39b break - up into two @xmath1-particles and a proton , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "this could be presented as a 100% branching ratio for @xmath3p@xmath1 or @xmath4p decay to @xmath42he , but the decays of the @xmath43 nuclei are special in several aspects @xcite and are not typical for this decay mode .",
    "although @xmath3p@xmath1 has not been observed so far for @xmath40o it must occur since @xmath3-decays to the ias in @xmath40n have been observed @xcite and close to half of the ias decays are known from reaction experiments @xcite to go via proton - emission to @xmath1 unbound states in @xmath44c or @xmath1-emission to proton unbound states in @xmath39b .",
    "actually , the final state in both cases will be a proton and three @xmath1-particles which makes the decay more challenging to observe .",
    "the total branching ratio for the decay mode can be estimated to be @xmath45 .    for @xmath21ne",
    "both decay orderings , @xmath3p@xmath1 and @xmath4p , have been observed @xcite with a total branching ratio for the decay mode of @xmath46 .",
    "all observed decays proceed through the ias in @xmath21f and go to the final nucleus @xmath44c .",
    "adding now our observation of @xmath2mg(@xmath3p@xmath1)@xmath23o it is striking that all cases go through an @xmath1-conjugate nucleus , namely @xmath47be , @xmath44c , @xmath23o and @xmath22ne respectively . before drawing any firm structure conclusions we shall consider the broader systematics of beta - delayed particle emission in @xmath48 nuclei .",
    "similar patterns also appear in other beta - delayed particle decays ( see @xcite for more data and for references to the original work ) .",
    "one closely related example is @xmath4 decays that occur for all bound @xmath49 , @xmath50 nuclei up to @xmath51 : @xmath47b , @xmath44n , @xmath22na , @xmath52al , @xmath53p , @xmath54cl , @xmath55k and @xmath56sc .",
    "the @xmath3p decays are well established @xcite to occur strongly in @xmath57 , @xmath58 nuclei .",
    "the @xmath32p decays of @xmath59al and @xmath60p and the @xmath33p decay of @xmath61ar @xcite also all end up in an @xmath1-conjugate nucleus .",
    "the decays observed for the elements",
    "n to si are shown in figure [ fig : ton ] .",
    "note that the @xmath4 and @xmath3p modes are not marked explicitly when the @xmath3p@xmath1 or @xmath32p modes also occur .",
    "in the following we shall argue that the observed patterns are likely ( except for the very lightest nuclei ) to be related to odd - even effects rather than @xmath1-cluster structure .",
    "we start by considering the systematics of @xmath62-values for nuclei with @xmath48 as illustrated in figure [ fig : qsys ] .",
    "even though many effects contribute to the masses in this region , a liquid drop estimate reproduces the trend of @xmath62 for the odd - a nuclei with @xmath63 ( dashed line ) where only the coulomb term enters , as well as for @xmath64 ( dotted line ) where the asymmetry term also contributes . note that @xmath62 in the latter case varies little for @xmath6 between 25 and 50 .",
    "the experimental data show that the @xmath62-values are roughly the same for each `` quartet '' of four nuclei that , as illustrated in the left panel of figure [ fig : sketch ] , have proton and neutron numbers ( z , n ) , ( z , n+1 ) , ( z-1,n ) , ( z-1,n+1 ) where both z and n are even .",
    "this is pronounced for quartets where the even - even nucleus has @xmath65 , and holds to a lesser degree also for @xmath66 for mass numbers up to 40 .",
    "the reason for this is that the two odd - a nuclei are at the same distance from the beta - stability line and therefore have about the same @xmath67-value , as also shown by the liquid drop estimate . without a pairing term in the liquid drop formula the @xmath67-value for the even - even nucleus would be larger and the odd - odd smaller , but the odd - even effects counteracts this and as can be seen from figure [ fig : qsys ] the magnitudes are even reversed for most nuclei . for the quartet with @xmath65 ( and @xmath50 ) the odd - odd nucleus has @xmath7 and is therefore extra bound , this happens to result in @xmath67-values that are almost the same for all four nuclei .",
    "the quartets are indicated in figure [ fig : ton ] by thicker lines .",
    "the observed decay patterns now follow from the energetics and are illustrated in the right panel of figure [ fig : sketch ] .",
    "the @xmath4 decays should occur in odd - odd nuclei , since they have slightly higher @xmath67-values and the daughter alpha particle separation energies tend to be smallest here .",
    "the @xmath3p decays need low proton separation energies in the daughter nucleus and therefore are more prominent for even z , starting ( as one goes from stability towards the proton dripline ) in an even - odd nucleus .",
    "the @xmath3p@xmath1 decay should be favoured in even - odd nuclei , and @xmath32p and @xmath33p decays should occur in odd - odd and even - odd nuclei , respectively , by extending these arguments .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath4 , @xmath3p and @xmath3p@xmath1 decays appear first in the quartets where the even - even nucleus has @xmath66 and the odd - odd nucleus @xmath65 , but @xmath3p occurs also in @xmath68zn , @xmath69ge and heavier nuclei .",
    "the beta - delayed multi - proton decays appear in more exotic nuclei , but it is noteworthy that @xmath4 in these nuclei only has been observed in the odd - odd @xmath59al .",
    "similar patterns can be expected for @xmath70-delayed particle decays , although the grouping of @xmath67-values is less pronounced here .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath3n@xmath1 decay modes will in general occur further away from the beta - stability line .",
    "our study of the decay of @xmath2 mg has given the first evidence for the occurence of the @xmath4 and @xmath3p@xmath1 decay modes in this nucleus .",
    "the assignment of these decay modes to @xmath2 mg has been verified through statistical tests of the time distribution of the events .",
    "the occurence of these decay modes in the @xmath0 decay of @xmath2 mg fits naturally into the systematics of previously observed @xmath0-delayed decays .",
    "we presented a brief overview of this systematics and argued that it can be explained by the variation in decay energy due to odd - even effects and that there is no need to invoke specific structure effects such as alpha - clustering in spite of @xmath1-conjugate nuclei occuring often as final state nuclei .",
    "this interpretation can be tested when new instances of these exotic decays are discovered .",
    "the @xmath3p@xmath1 decay mode may not occur in heavier @xmath64 nuclei than @xmath2 mg ( the @xmath67-value becomes more than 10 mev in @xmath71ge , but the coulomb barrier for @xmath1-particle emission is substantial then ) , but may be found also in the @xmath72 nuclei @xmath41si , @xmath73s , @xmath61ar etc . if found in @xmath22 mg it may help to quantify the @xmath74o(@xmath1,@xmath75)@xmath76ne reaction rate @xcite .",
