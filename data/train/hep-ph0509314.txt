    "<S> we analyze longitudinal pion spectra from @xmath0  gev to @xmath1  gev within landau s hydrodynamical model . from the measured data on the widths of the pion rapidity spectra </S>",
    "<S> , we extract the sound velocity @xmath2 in the early stage of the reactions . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the sound velocity has a local minimum ( indicating a softest point in the equation of state , eos ) at @xmath3  gev . </S>",
    "<S> this softening of the eos is compatible with the assumption of the formation of a mixed phase at the onset of deconfinement .    over the last years </S>",
    "<S> , a wealth of detailed data in the @xmath4  gev energy regime has become available . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic study of these data revealed surprising ( non - monotonous ) structures in various observables around @xmath5  gev beam energy . </S>",
    "<S> most notable irregular structures in that energy regime include ,    * the sharp maximum in the k@xmath6 ratio @xcite , * a step in the transverse momentum excitation function ( as seen through @xmath7 ) @xcite , * an apparent change in the pion per participant ratio @xcite and * increased ratio fluctuations ( due to missing data at low energies it is unknown if this is a local maximum or an ongoing increase of the fluctuations ) @xcite </S>",
    "<S> .    it has been speculated , that these observation hint towards the onset of deconfinement already at @xmath5  gev beam energy . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , increased strangeness production @xcite and enhanced fluctuations have long been predicted as a sign of qgp formation @xcite within different frameworks and observables . </S>",
    "<S> the suggestion of an enhanced strangeness to entropy ratio ( @xmath8 ) as indicator for the onset of qgp formation was especially advocated in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also the high and approximately constant @xmath9 inverse slopes of the @xmath10 spectra above @xmath11  gev - the step - was also found to be consistent with the assumption of a parton @xmath12 hadron phase transition at low sps energies @xcite . surprisingly , transport simulations ( supplemented by recent lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculations ) have also suggested that partonic degrees of freedom might already lead to visible effects at @xmath11  gev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the comparison of the thermodynamic parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 extracted from the transport models in the central overlap region @xcite with the experimental systematics on chemical freeze - out configurations @xcite in the @xmath15 plane do also suggest that a first glimpse on a deconfined state might be possible around @xmath16  gev .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we explore whether similar irregularities are also present in the excitation function of longitudinal observables , namely rapidity distributions . here </S>",
    "<S> we will employ landau s hydrodynamical model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model entered the focus again after the most remarkable observation that the rapidity distributions at all investigated energies can be well described by a single gaussian at each energy . </S>",
    "<S> the energy dependence of the width can also be reasonably described by the same model . for recent applications of landau s model to relativistic hadron - hadron and nucleus - nucleus interactions </S>",
    "<S> the reader is referred to @xcite ( and refs . </S>",
    "<S> therein ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the main physics assumptions of landau s picture are as follows : the collision of two lorentz - contracted nuclei leads to full thermalization in a volume of size @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this justifies the use of thermodynamics and establishes the system size and energy dependence . </S>",
    "<S> usually , a simple equation of state @xmath18 with @xmath19 ( @xmath20 denotes the speed of sound ) is assumed . for simplicity , </S>",
    "<S> chemical potentials are not taken into account . from these assumptions </S>",
    "<S> follows a universal formula for the distribution of the produced entropy , determined mainly by the initial lorentz contraction and gaussian rapidity spectrum for newly produced particles . under the condition </S>",
    "<S> that @xmath20 is independent of temperature , the rapidity density is given by @xcite : @xmath21 with @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a normalisation factor and @xmath24 is the proton mass . </S>",
    "<S> the model relates the observed particle multiplicity and distribution in a simple and direct way to the parameters of the qcd matter under consideration .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now analyze the available experimental data on rapidity distributions of negatively charged pions in terms of the landau model . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ rapwidth ] shows the measured root mean square @xmath25 of the rapidity distribution of negatively charged pions in central pb+pb ( au+au ) reactions as a function of the beam rapidity . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted line indicates the landau model predictions with the commonly used constant sound velocity @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the full line shows a linear fit through the data points , while the data points @xcite are depicted by full symbols .    </S>",
    "<S> at a first glance the energy dependence looks structureless . </S>",
    "<S> the data seem to follow a linear dependence on the beam rapidity @xmath26 without any irregularities . </S>",
    "<S> however , the general trend of the rapidity widths is also well reproduced by landau s model with an equation of state with a fixed speed of sound . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , there seem to be systematic deviations . at low ags energies and at rhic , the experimental points are generally underpredicted by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq2 ] ) , while in the sps energy regime landau s model overpredicts the widths of the rapidity distributions . </S>",
    "<S> exactly these deviations from the simple landau picture do allow to gain information on the equation of state of the matter produced in the early stage of the reaction . by inverting eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq2 ] ) we can express the speed of sound @xmath2 in the medium as a function of the measured width of the rapidity distribution : @xmath27 ^ 2 + 1}\\quad . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eq3}\\ ] ]    let us now investigate the energy dependence of the sound velocities extracted from the data . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ cs2 ] shows the speed of sound as a function of beam energy for central pb+pb ( au+au ) reactions as obtained from the data using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq3 ] ) . the sound velocities exhibit a clear minimum ( usually called the softest point ) around a beam energy of @xmath5  gev . </S>",
    "<S> a localized softening of the equation of state is a long predicted signal for the mixed phase at the transition energy from hadronic to partonic matter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that the measured data on the rapidity widths of negatively charged pions are indeed compatible with the assumption of the onset of deconfinement at the lower sps energy range . </S>",
    "<S> however , presently we can not rule out that also an increased resonance contribution may be the cause of the softening @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have explored the excitation functions of the rapidity widths of negatively charged pions in pb+pb ( au+au ) collisions .    * </S>",
    "<S> the rapidity spectra of pions produced in central nucleus - nucleus reactions at all investigated energies can be well described by single gaussians . </S>",
    "<S> * the energy dependence of the width of the pion rapidity distribution follows the prediction of landau s hydrodynamical model if a variation of the sound velocity is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> * the speed of sound excitation function extracted from the data has a pronounced minimum ( softest point ) at @xmath3  gev . </S>",
    "<S> * this softest point might be due to the formation of a mixed phase indicating the onset of deconfinement at this energy .    </S>",
    "<S> further explorations of this energy domain is needed and can be done at the future fair facility and by cern - sps and bnl - rhic experiments . </S>"
