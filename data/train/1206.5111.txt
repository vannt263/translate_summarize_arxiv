    "is plotted together with the measured data as a function of the ion position .",
    "the measurement of the y component of the field is in good agreement with the calculation , whereas the x component shows a deviation of about @xmath199 .",
    "this can be explained by the fact , that the rogers4350b@xmath118 boards are elastic .",
    "pictures taken from the assembled trap stack show , that the outer compensation boards slightly bend away from the rf trap boards in the center and therefore have a larger distance to the trap center in x direction .",
    "this leads to a decreased static electric field at a given compensation voltage @xmath95 .",
    "a fem calculation , in which the distance between the compensation and trap boards is varied , shows a decrease of the dc field in x direction of about @xmath200 for an increase of the electrode distance of @xmath125 , which is reasonable looking at the taken pictures .    on the other hand , along the y direction the ion is shifted by applying @xmath72 on the rf ground electrodes on the quadrupole trap boards .",
    "as these electrodes are more rigidly machined from one continuous wafer and measured secular frequencies have confirmed the expected rf quadrupole geometry , no relevant deviations in the applied dc fields , created by @xmath72 , are expected here .",
    "this gives a strong argument for the good agreement between the measurement and the calculations in the case of the vertical ion shift , where @xmath201 is measured .",
    "to measure residual axial rf fields , a single ion was shifted in the direction of the trap axis and the micromotion was measured , see figure  [ axial_mm ] .",
    "for an indium ion optical clock .",
    "the zero axial position corresponds to the ion position for @xmath202 , where the measurement was initiated.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the laser beams have been adjusted while shifting the ion , in order to prevent systematic uncertainties due to a change in the intensity at the ion position . as a cross - check we measured the residual radial rf field and verified a value below @xmath203 in the range of @xmath204 .",
    "in addition to that , fem calculations have been carried out for comparison .",
    "the calculations include the contribution to the rf electric field due to the finite length of the trap as well as the slits between the electrodes . alignment and machining uncertainties and their effect on the rf field have been investigated in  @xcite . according to that",
    ", variations in the width of the slits between the electrodes due to machining tolerances would affect the measured field gradient and can be an explanation for the slightly larger rf fields .",
    "besides that , we observed a deviation of @xmath205 between the ion position with minimum micromotion and the average ion position for symmetric axial dc voltages @xmath206 , which is at @xmath207 in figure  [ axial_mm ] .",
    "this can be due to angular misalignment of the trap boards , leading to an offset in the axial rf field in the trapping region  @xcite , machining tolerances of the electrode notches or dc stray fields , shifting the ion from their average position in the axial trapping potential .",
    "these effects are not distinguishable in the present setup .    for optical clock operation with in@xmath208 ions ,",
    "the amplitudes of axial rf fields need to be @xmath209 to guarantee a small enough fractional frequency shift due to time dilation of @xmath210 .",
    "we find a length of about @xmath211 in our ion trap driven at an rf voltage amplitude of @xmath212 , within which this condition is fulfilled . at full rf amplitude of @xmath78",
    ", this length is reduced by about a factor of two , allowing space for about 12 trapped ions .",
    "we presented a new experiment to test novel ion traps for optical clock operation with flexible optical access to perform measurements of micromotion in all dimensions . in our new scalable ion trap ,",
    "we are able to load and trap single @xmath1 ions as a high - resolution electric field probe , as well as linear coulomb crystals for multi - ion optical clock operation .",
    "we detailed on the design and construction of a novel ion trap based on stacked printed circuit boards with on - board filter electronics and a low loss rf circuit with a loaded quality factor of @xmath76 .",
    "using photon - correlation spectroscopy we demonstrated the measurement of fractional frequency shifts due to excess micromotion with a resolution of @xmath213 , which allows us to characterize trap designs for the use of an optical clock with lowest systematic shifts .    with this , we were able to show that already the printed circuit board trap features a region of @xmath211 along the trap axis , in which the relative frequency shift due to micromotion is @xmath214 at a trap voltage of @xmath141 . for a multi - ion clock based on @xmath0 ions",
    ", this corresponds to a region of @xmath215 operating the ion trap at @xmath216 and @xmath217 , @xmath218 .",
    "this allows to trap a chain of about 12 @xmath0 ions for optical clock operation with @xmath219 .",
    "based on the design presented and tested in this paper , an ion trap of laser - cut aln wafers will be machined in - house . here",
    ", a better mechanical stiffness and precision can be obtained and only non - magnetic materials will be used .",
    "we expect an improvement in the performance in terms of axial micromotion as well as heat conductivity for precise ion trap temperature evaluation .",
    "in addition , a larger number of trap segments will allow to increase the number of ions used for spectroscopy .",
