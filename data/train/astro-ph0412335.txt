    "deep surveys have resolved the bulk of the x - ray background in both the soft and the hard energies ( mushotzky et al .",
    "2000 ; brandt et al . 2001 ; giaconni et al .",
    "2002 ; alexander et al .",
    "a striking result is that these surveys do not find a single dominant population of heavily obscured agns , predicted by the x - ray background population synthesis models . on the contrary a heterogeneous population of sources",
    "is detected comprising a mix of ( i ) bl agn ( qsos and seyfert-1 galaxies ) , ( ii ) narrow emission line agn , ( iii ) optically faint sources ( @xmath9mag ) and ( iv ) passive galaxies with absorption line optical spectra .",
    "the latter class of sources , frequently dubbed x - ray bright optically inactive galaxies ( xbongs ) , shows no sign of agn activity in their optical spectra ( e.g. no emission lines ) , while the x - ray luminosity is large enough ( @xmath10 ) that is hard to reconcile without invoking the presence of agn activity ( fiore et al .",
    "2003 ; hornschemeier et al . 2001 ; barger et al .",
    "although this class of sources has been detected in previous low resolution x - ray missions ( elvis et al . 1981 ; griffiths et al . 1995 ; moran et al .",
    "1996 ; blair , georgantopoulos & stewart 1997 ) it is only recently that they have received much attention .",
    "this interest has been initiated by the suggestion that these sources host heavily obscured agns ( e.g. comastri et al . 2002 ) and therefore , they may be the missing link between observations and model predictions . indeed , a large fraction of completely hidden agns may be hosted by optically normal galaxies , partially explaining the scarcity of obscured agn in deep x - ray surveys ( comastri et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "alternatively , the lack of optical emission lines can be explained if the nuclear component is outshined by the strong stellar continuum ( e.g. severgnini et al .",
    "the x - ray spectra provide an invaluable tool for discriminating between the above possibilities .",
    "unfortunately , the sources detected in the deep fields are in general too faint to allow detailed x - ray spectral analysis .",
    "therefore , it is important to find nearby , bright examples of xbongs in wide angle relatively shallower surveys .",
    "wide areal coverage is difficult to achieve with the _ chandra _ observatory due its limited field  of  view . on the contrary , _ xmm - newton _ with 4 times larger",
    "field - of - view provides an ideal platform for such a study . in this paper",
    "we exploit the capabilities and the large volume of archival data of the xmm-_newton _ to serendipitously identify xbongs in public fields selected to overlap with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "this is to exploit the superb and uniform 5-band optical photometry and spectroscopy available in this area . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "in this paper we use _ xmm - newton _ archival observations with a proprietary period that expired before september 2003 and that overlap with the first data release of the sdss ( dr1 ; stoughton et al .",
    "the sdss is an on - going imaging and spectroscopic survey that aims to cover about @xmath14 of the sky .",
    "photometry is performed in 5 bands ( @xmath15 ; fukugita et al .",
    "1996 ; stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) to the limiting magnitude @xmath16mag , providing a uniform and homogeneous multi - color photometric catalogue .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic observations will obtain spectra for over 1 million objects , including galaxies brighter than @xmath17mag , luminous red galaxies to @xmath18 and colour selected qsos ( york et al . 2000 ; stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ archival observations used here have the epic ( european photon imaging camera ; strder et al . 2001 ; turner et al .",
    "2001 ) cameras as the prime instrument operated in full frame mode . for fields observed more than once with the _ xmm - newton _ we use the deeper of the multiple observations .",

    "fields used here are listed in table [ log ] .",
    "the x - ray data have been analysed using the science analysis software ( sas 5.4 ) .",
    "the event files produced by the _ xmm - newton _ science center data reduction pipeline were screened for high particle background periods by rejecting time intervals with 0.5 - 10kev count rates higher than 30 and 15cts / s for the pn and the two mos cameras respectively .",
    "the pn and mos good time intervals for these pointings are shown in table [ log ] .",
    "the differences between the pn and mos exposure times are due to varying start and end times of individual observations .",
    "only events corresponding to patterns 04 for the pn and 012 for mos have been kept .    in order to increase the signal  to  noise ratio and to reach fainter fluxes the pn and the mos event files",
    "have been combined into a single event list using the merge task of sas .",
    "images have been extracted in the spectral bands 0.5 - 8 ( total ) , 0.5 - 2 ( soft ) and 2 - 8kev ( hard ) for both the merged and the individual pn and mos event files .",
    "we use the more sensitive ( higher s / n ratio ) merged image for source extraction and flux estimation , while the individual pn and mos images are used to calculate hardness ratios .",
    "this is because the interpretation of hardness ratios is simplified if the extracted count rates are from one detector only .",
    "exposure maps accounting for vignetting , ccd gaps and bad pixels have been constructed for each spectral band . in the present study the source detection",
    "is performed on the 0.5 - 8kev image using the ewavelet task of sas with a detection threshold of @xmath19 . in this paper",
    "we only consider sources with offaxis angles @xmath20arcmin and therefore the total surveyed area is about @xmath21 . a total of 1286 x - ray sources have been detected to the limit @xmath22 .",
    "about 10 per cent of the total survey area is covered at the flux limit @xmath23 .",
    "this fraction increases to about 50 per cent at @xmath24 .",
    "count rates in the merged ( pn+mos ) images as well as the individual pn and mos images are estimated within an 18arcsec aperture .",
    "for the background estimation we use the background maps generated as a by - product of the ewavelet task of sas .",
    "a small fraction of sources lie close to masked regions ( ccd gaps or hot pixels ) on either the mos or the pn detectors .",
    "this may introduce errors in the estimated source counts . to avoid this bias , the source count rates ( and hence the hardness ratios and the flux )",
    "are estimated using the detector ( mos or pn ) with no masked pixels in the vicinity of the source .",
    "we convert counts to flux assuming a power - law spectrum with @xmath25 and the appropriate galactic absorption for each field listed in table [ log ] ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) . the mean count - rate to flux conversion ( or enery conversion factor , ecf ) for the mosaic of all three detectors is estimated by weighting the ecfs of individual detectors by the respective exposure time . for the encircled energy correction , accounting for the energy fraction outside the aperture within which source counts are accumulated , we adopt the calibration given by the _ xmm - newton _ calibration documentation .",

    "the probability depends on both the separation of the optical counterpart from the x - ray centroid and the surface density of the optical sources at the given magnitude ( see georgakakis et al .",

    "we adopt a probability threshold @xmath27 and a maximum search radius of 7arcsec .",

    "a total of 33 sources fulfill the above criteria of which 14 have ` early - type ' spectra showing absorption lines only and lacking emission lines .",
    "finally , we exclude two sources which have low x - ray to optical flux ratio , @xmath28 and therefore are most probably associated with normal galaxies i.e. their x - ray emission comes from binaries and diffuse hot gas ( see hornschemeier et al . 2003 ) .",

    "adafs coupled with outflows and winds ( blandford & begelman 1999 ) have been proposed to explain the hard x - ray emission of nearby elliptical galaxies ( allen , di matteo & fabian 2000 ) .",
    "we roughly estimate the ratio of the bolometric to the eddington luminosity @xmath146 for our six candidate agns .",
    "we assume that the bolometric luminosity is an order of magnitude larger than the x - ray luminosity ( e.g. nicastro et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the black hole mass and thus the eddington luminosity is estimated from the @xmath147 luminosity relation of gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ; the implicit assumption here is that the all six agn are associated with early - type systems and thus @xmath148 .",
    "we find that @xmath149 and hence in principle some of our objects could be associated with adafs .",
    "however , the adaf models predict relatively hard x - ray spectra ( @xmath150 ) that are inconsistent with the soft x - ray spectral properties of most of our sources .",
    "adaf models ( e.g. quataert & narayan 1999 ) further predict that the x - ray luminosity is about 1 - 2dex higher than the radio luminosity . for our sources",
    "however , the x - ray  to  radio luminosity ratio is estimated to be @xmath151 , disfavoring the adaf scenario .",

    "( 2002 ) argue on the basis of the multiwavelength observations that the xbong source 031238.9 - 765134 could be associated with a completely hidden agn .",
    "this source presents a flat spectrum with @xmath152 .",
    "the absence of a narrow - line emission optical spectrum typical of obscured agn could be explained if the source were _ spherically _ covered by the obscuration screen , instead of the toroidal obscuration model which is usually assumed by the agn unification models . alternatively , moran et al .",
    "( 2002 ) propose that at higher redshifts ( @xmath153 ) the low equivalent width narrow emission lines may be readily masked by the optical galaxy continuum .",
    "the possibility that a population of hidden agn is hosted in apparently normal galaxies is intriguing .",
    "this could partially explain the scarcity of obscured agn in the deep surveys .",
    "however , in our sample , we find no significant evidence for flat x - ray spectra or equivalently large absorbing columns .",
    "we note again however , that our sample may be biased against such heavily obscured sources , as it is selected in the total 0.5 - 8 kev band .",
    "indeed , as the effective area of is high at soft energies , the total energy band contains a large number of soft sources and hence , the _ fraction _ of absorbed xbong may be low .",
    "our sample is further biased against high @xmath154 objects as it is selected to contain optically bright sources with spectroscopic information available in sdss .",
    "we nevertheless believe that the latter does not introduce any bias against obscured xbong . at relatively low redshifts ( @xmath155 )",
    "a large absorbing column will reduce the x - ray emission relative to the optical and results in low @xmath154 values ; for example the source 031238.9 - 765134 ( comastri et al . 2002 ) has @xmath156 .",

    "we explore the x - ray properties of a sample of 12 x - ray bright optically inactive galaxies ( xbong ) .",
    "these are detected in 20 fields in the total 0.5 - 8 kev band overlapping with the sdss .",
    "we concentrate only on those systems with available sdss optical spectroscopic information and select sources which present only absorption lines in their optical spectra .",
    "we further select our objects to have high x - ray to optical flux ratios ( @xmath157 ) to reduce contamination by normal galaxies .",
    "the resulting sample covers the luminosity range @xmath158 and the redshift interval @xmath3 .",
    "our sample comprises ( i ) extended x - ray sources most probably associated with galaxy clusters , ( ii ) normal galaxies and ( iii ) _ unobscured _ agn .",
    "the unobscured agn do not present emission lines probably because the optical light from the nucleus is diluted by a strong galaxy component ( e.g. moran et al .",
    "2002 ; severgnini et al .",
    "2003 , georgantopoulos et al .",
    "previous work ( comastri et al . 2002 ) has suggested that the lack of optical emission lines in xbongs could be attributed to the fact that the central source suffers from large obscuration .",
    "we find no evidence in our sample for the presence of xbongs which present significant x - ray absorption .",
    "as we imposed a cut - off in optical magnitude , our sample is not complete and therefore we can not conclusively rule out the possibility that some xbongs fainter that our magnitude limit present x - ray absorption .",
    "nevertheless , our present work shows that the absence of optical emission lines in at least a fraction of xbongs , can be explained from the dilution rather than absorption of the optical nuclear light .",
