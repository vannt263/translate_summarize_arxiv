    "atomic position localization has been an intriguing subject from the early days of the quantum mechanics , as seen in heisenberg s microscope , a well - known thought experiment devised for illustrating the uncertainty principle@xcite .",
    "heisenberg s microscope exploits the interaction of an atom with light : the information on atomic position is obtained by detecting the scattered light .",
    "the resolution is limited roughly to a half wavelength of the light due to the wave nature of light .",
    "the uncertainty in atomic momentum automatically arises since the light imparts a mechanical momentum to the atom @xcite .    in a modern version of heisenberg s microscope ,",
    "on the other hand , one considers a quantum or classical light field with `` standing - wave '' mode structure in order to localize the atom without scattering photons @xcite . because the strength of the interaction in a standing - wave field depends on the position , the observable quantities such as the phase shift of the atomic dipole , or that of the light field vary according to the atomic position .",
    "thus , the measurements of these quantities yield information on the atomic position",
    ". all these schemes can determine the atomic position only within one period ( i.e. a half wavelength ) of the standing - wave structure due to the translational symmetry of the interaction .",
    "recently storey _ et al .",
    "_ have proposed to measure the quadrature amplitudes of light interacting with a two - level atom at far - off resonance@xcite . they also suggested that changing the width of a virtual slit , produced in the measurement of the field , by varying the phase of the field being measured , can implement popper s test@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the localization by the measurement of the phase shift of the atomic dipole moment in a ramsey interferometer set up was proposed using the classical standing - wave field@xcite , or the quantum field@xcite , and was demonstrated experimentally by kunze _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "atomic position can also be localized by the frequency measurement of the photons scattered spontaneously from the atom@xcite , using the fact that the mollow - sideband spectrum in the resonance fluorescence depends on the atomic position in the standing wave field .",
    "other techniques , which do not involve the interaction with the standing - wave field , were proposed such as atom imaging methods@xcite , where an inhomogeneous magnetic field@xcite or light intensity@xcite causes a spatially - varying atomic level - shift , which correlates the atomic resonance frequency with the atomic position .    until now , only a single observable among the various physical quantities involved in the atom - field dynamics has been chosen to be measured in order to localize the atomic position . in this work , we consider localization by _ dual measurements _ ,",
    "i.e. , we measure two observables for the localization of the atomic position .",
    "our motivation for this scheme is twofold .",
    "first , it is based on the naive expectation that the more observables we measure , the better localization we could get . of course , these variables should be correlated with the atomic position . otherwise , increasing the number of the measured observables would be of no use .",
    "our second motivation is more academic in that we hope to investigate the dynamics of the system conditioned _ a posterior _ on the measurements .",
    "let us denote the hermitian operators of the measured observables by @xmath0,@xmath1 ( [ @xmath0,@xmath1]=0 ) and their eigen - values by @xmath3 @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "we represent the system state before measurement by the wavefunction @xmath5 and assume that the value @xmath6 is obtained by the @xmath0 measurement .",
    "( the states @xmath7 belong to the hilbert spaces independent of the operator @xmath0 . )",
    "then , the state after the measurement , @xmath8 , is obtained by performing the projection operator @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "the state @xmath8 can be decomposed in terms of the bases @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "if one measures further the observable @xmath1 , then each wavefunction @xmath13 ( independent of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) can be retrieved . however ,",
    "if the observable @xmath1 is not measured , the data collected through only @xmath0 measurement would yield the state of the system traced over the observable @xmath1 , only to lose information of each wavefunction @xmath14 . the dynamics conditioned",
    "_ a posterior _ on the measurement ( @xmath1 measurement in this case ) could demonstrate a substantially distinguished phenomenon compared with the usual averaged one@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we localize the atomic position by measuring both the quadrature amplitude of the light and the internal state of the atom .",
    "we consider a three - level atom interacting with a single quantized standing - wave field in a ramsey interferometer setup .",
    "the atom has two hyperfine ground levels @xmath15,@xmath16 and one excited level @xmath17 .",
    "the quantized field couples both the states @xmath15 and @xmath16 to @xmath17 at far - off resonance with different coupling constants .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian shows that both the field state and the internal states are entangled with the atomic position .",
    "in addition to the position localization , we investigate the mechanical action of the standing - wave field on the atom , introduced inevitably by the localization .",
    "we show that the momentum uncertainty caused by the mechanical action does not hinder the popper s test in the localization schemes such as the one proposed by storey _ et al._@xcite and that in a certain situation , the uncertainty can be minimized .    this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the interaction hamiltonian and calculate the final state obtained after the interaction in the raman - nath regime .",
    "we show in section iii that the localization by the measurements , in the near region , i.e. right after the interaction , yields a position distribution which resembles an interference pattern superimposed on a diffraction pattern .",
    "the interference pattern is attributed to the measurement of the atomic internal state while the diffraction to that of the quadrature amplitude of the light .",
    "it is found that the localization is sharper than in the single measurement schemes , so the uncertainty @xmath18 of the position localization is smaller . in section iv ,",
    "the position distribution in the far region is presented and it is explained in terms of the dipole force by the standing - wave field correlated with the measurements .",
    "especially , we are interested whether popper s test can be implemented in the measurement schemes exploiting the interaction with the standing - wave field in section v. we summarize the results in section vi .",
    "in fig.1 , the system configuration is depicted with the appropriate atomic level diagram . the atom is initially prepared in the state @xmath15 .",
    "the atom first enters the microwave - field region ( @xmath19-pulse ) , where the internal state is transformed to the superposed one @xmath20 .",
    "next , it interacts with the standing - wave field inside the cavity at far - off resonance .",
    "the cavity frequency @xmath21 is tuned in the midway between the atomic transition frequencies @xmath22 , @xmath23 so that @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "if both the detunings satisfies the conditions @xmath26 , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are the spontaneous emission rates from the excited state @xmath17 , then the excited state is rarely populated through the interaction , and thus can be ignored .",
    "for example , the rb@xmath29 atom has two hyperfine ground levels f=2,3 with the splitting @xmath30 ghz and the decay rates roughly @xmath31 mhz , so the conditions @xmath26 and @xmath27 are readily satisfied .    by the method of the adiabatic elimination@xcite , the interaction hamiltonian inside the cavity",
    "is then written in the form as @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the vacuum rabi - frequencies associated with the transitions @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , @xmath37(@xmath38 ) is the photon creation ( annihilation ) operator for the cavity mode and @xmath39 is the wave vector of the standing - wave mode .",
    "we set @xmath40 , which can be adjusted by controlling the cavity frequency appropriately .",
    "we neglect the kinetic energy term in the raman - nath approximation , where the interaction time is short enough for the motional effect to be neglected .",
    "let us denote the initial position distribution by @xmath41 and assume that the cavity mode is in a coherent state @xmath42 .",
    "if the atomic internal state is @xmath43 before entering the cavity ( @xmath44 in our case ) , the initial state of the total system is denoted by @xmath45 , the state becomes @xmath46,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 in eq.(3 ) , we see that the phase of the cavity field is altered through the interaction .",
    "if the atomic internal state is @xmath15 , then the field state is rotated in the wigner diagram ( see fig.2 ) by the angle @xmath48 on the other hand , if the atom is in state @xmath16 , the rotation angle is given by @xmath49 note that the field state after the interaction is entangled with the internal state as well as the atomic position , as seen in the above eqs.(5 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "if the quadrature amplitude @xmath50 of the field is measured , the atomic position is then localized .",
    "we set @xmath51 and select @xmath52 so that the measured quantity @xmath53 corresponds to the x - axis value in the wigner diagram . when the atom is localized at the node ( @xmath54 ) , between the node and the antinode ( @xmath55 ) , and at the antinode ( @xmath56 ) , the field state is accordingly rotated by the angles @xmath57 , respectively , where @xmath58 sign refers to the case of the internal state @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "then , the measured amplitude @xmath53 will be roughly @xmath59 .",
    "conversely , if the field amplitude is measured to be @xmath59 , then the atom is localized at the node , between the node and the antinode , and at the anti - node , respectively , via the measurement .",
    "this is how the localization by the field measurement comes about@xcite .    after interacting with the cavity field",
    ", the atom enters the second @xmath19-pulse microwave region .",
    "thus , the final state is given by @xmath60.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the following , we use the formula @xmath61|0\\rangle \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the eigenstate of the operator @xmath63@xcite with @xmath64 , and thus the inner product @xmath65 is given by @xmath66}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 $ ] and @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "now , if the field state is measured to be found in the eigen - state @xmath69 after the entire interaction , it is found from eqs.(7 ) and ( 9 ) that the the system collapses to the state @xmath70\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath71 with @xmath72 if we measure the atomic internal state in addition , the final position distribution of the atom is given by @xmath73 when the atom is found to be in @xmath15 and @xmath74 in @xmath16 .",
    "thus , @xmath75 and @xmath76 may be interpreted as the filter functions for the initial position distribution associated with our measurement scheme .",
    "to understand where the filter functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 originate from , we now consider the case that the ramsey fields are turned off and the atom remains in the same internal state throughout the entire interaction .",
    "we then measure the quadrature amplitude of the field only , as in the scheme proposed by storey _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "if the atomic state is @xmath15 and the field state is measured to be @xmath69 , then the final atomic state is given by latexmath:[\\ ] ] let us assume that the measurement localizes the atomic wavepacket as a gaussian , like in eq.(21 ) , with @xmath124 .",
    "then , it is easily obtained that @xmath125 when the atom is localized well ( @xmath126 ) , eq.(24 ) becomes @xmath127 the momentum uncertainty is smaller for the narrower distribution , as seen in eq.(25 ) , where @xmath128 is proportional to @xmath129 . due to this fact , although the mechanical action is inevitably accompanied in the localization , popper s test can nevertheless be implemented in the measurement schemes using the standing - wave field , as explained below .",
    "the momentum uncertainty @xmath130 results from two sources if we follow the copenhagen interpretation .",
    "one is the knowledge of the position ( @xmath131 ) itself , and the other is the mechanical action by the dipole force in the standing - wave field ( @xmath132 in eq.(25 ) ) , so that @xmath133 .",
    "let us assume that two different measurement schemes ( e.g. , two different quadrature measurements in storey s scheme ) yield the position localization as @xmath134 . since the uncertainty caused by the dipole force is smaller in the narrower distribution , we have ( @xmath135 ) . if the far - region distribution is broader in the case of the narrower localization , i.e. @xmath136 , we should conclude that the momentum uncertainty caused by the `` knowledge '' is much larger in the narrower distribution , i.e. , @xmath137 .",
    "moreover , the uncertainty by the mechanical action of the dipole force can be eliminated when the measurement localizes the atom in the midway between the node and the anti - node ( @xmath138 with @xmath107 in eq.(25 ) ) .",
    "this is also the case even when the position distribution @xmath121 is not a gaussian as assumed in eq.(25 ) as long as the atom is well localized around at @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the proposal by storey _ et al . _ can implement popper s test even when the mechanical action due to the dipole force of the standing wave field is included in the localization .      in the above",
    ", we considered the case that the atom is definitely in one internal state .",
    "when the ramsey fields are turned on , the internal state of the atom inside the cavity is the superposed one .",
    "then , even when the atom is treated like a point particle ( i.e. , @xmath139 in eq .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) ) , a mechanical momentum uncertainty comes about because the mechanical momentum delivered to the atom in state @xmath15 is in the opposite direction to the momentum delivered to the atom in state @xmath16 .",
    "for this reason the mechanical momentum uncertainty in the dual measurement , @xmath140 , becomes always larger than that in the field measurement only , @xmath141 . we have shown in section iii that the uncertainty @xmath142 of the position localization in the dual measurement scheme is less than @xmath143 in the field measurement only . however , even if we get the result @xmath144 , this does not prove the copenhagen interpretation since @xmath145 , i.e. , there is additional momentum uncertainty caused by the indefiniteness of the atomic internal state in our dual measurement scheme .",
    "therefore , the comparison of the result of the dual measurement with that of the field measurement alone does not constitute popper s test .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the atomic position localization by the dual measurement , i.e. , both the field and the atomic internal state measurements , compared to the field measurement alone .",
    "we have also discussed the mechanical action of the light field , correlated with the measurement , on the atom .",
    "we began by showing that the localization is improved by the dual measurement scheme compared with the field - only measurement scheme .",
    "we then showed that although the localization exploiting the interaction with the standing wave - field at far - off resonance inevitably brings about the momentum uncertainty by the mechanical action of the dipole force origin , popper s test can be nevertheless implemented in the schemes in which the atomic internal state is definite inside the standing - wave field .",
    "moreover , we have found that it is better to localize the atom in the midway between the node and the antinode in order to minimize the momentum uncertainty .",
