    "bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) located in different minima of an external potential created by magnetic or light forces and coupled by tunneling through a potential barrier have been the host to many exciting developments and discoveries in recent years  @xcite .",
    "phenomena explored include analogs of the josephson effect in double or multiple quantum - well structures  @xcite , gap solitons of repulsive becs  @xcite , and quantum phase transitions  @xcite",
    ". often these systems are modeled by considering just one mode per potential minimum and their linear coupling provided by tunnling through a separating barrier .",
    "these simplified models , which are usually labelled as two - mode or multiple - mode models , variants of the bose - hubbard model , or the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation , are tailored to describe certain properties or aspects of the dynamics of the many - body system under investigation . although there is an abundance of literature on such models  @xcite ,",
    "there still appear to exist misconceptions about the nature of the effective model parameters , especially the sign of the tunnel coupling , as only few works attempt to calculate such parameters based on a more complete theoretical treatment  @xcite .",
    "the sign of the tunnel coupling bears special significance in systems where the tunneling appears over an extended ( at least one - dimensional ) region of space .",
    "such systems have recently been analysed by bouchoule  @xcite and kaurov and kuklov  @xcite , who studied two parallel tunnel - coupled cigar - shaped becs . in another recent work , lesanovsky and",
    "von klitzing studied the stability of tunnel - coupled annular becs  @xcite .",
    "the latter paper points to an interesting dynamical instability leading to the spontaneous formation of angular - momentum fluctuations .",
    "we will show further below that the sign on the tunnel coupling bears consequences on the nature and stability of the stationary states found in the mean - field treatment of tunnel - coupled becs . specifically , we find that the system studied by lesanovsky and von klitzing has a stable ground state for any value of the tunnel coupling and repulsive interactions .",
    "the instability of an _ excited _ state with @xmath0 phase difference between the condensates can be interpreted in terms of the familiar snake instability  @xcite .",
    "the ground state of a rotating co - planar double - ring system is discussed in ref .",

    "the calculation performed in ref .",
    "@xcite starts from a number of generally reasonable assumptions . under the condition that radial excitations of the vertically stacked annular becs are suppressed by the trapping potentials and",
    "the only mechanism for coupling the two systems is via tunneling through a potential barrier , the gross - pitaevskii equation for the two - mode spinor wave function @xmath1 specialises to @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the condensate wave function for atoms in the upper ( lower ) ring .",
    "our equation ( [ chieqs ] ) agrees with eq .",
    "( 2 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , except that we explicitly indicate the negative sign of the tunnel coupling .",
    "we give detailed reasons for the relevance of the sign of the tunnel coupling below in sec .",
    "[ sec : sign ] , where we also show that the tunnel coupling is indeed negative . at this point",
    ", we only note that the tunnel coupling @xmath4 was assumed to be positive in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see their fig .  1 ) , in contradiction to our findings .",
    "the most general form of the polar - angle - dependent wave function can be written as a fourier series , @xmath5 . inserting this _ ansatz _ into eq .",

    ", it is reasonable to assume that only the @xmath7 mode is occupied in each of the two annuli .",
    "straightforward calculation yields the new ground and excited state of the coupled - annuli system , which are the symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of single - well states having chemical potential @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is defined in terms of the equal number of atoms @xmath10 in each well as in ref .",

    "@xcite result in markedly different excitation spectra .",
    "we find that both the symmetric ( ground ) state and antisymmetric ( excited ) state share one branch ,    @xmath16    whose frequency is independent of the tunnel coupling .",
    "this was also found in ref .",
    "in contrast to these authors , however , we find that the second branch differs for the two states : @xmath17    clearly , @xmath18 is always real for repulsive becs ( @xmath19 ) , implying stability of the symmetric ( ground ) state of the coupled annular condensates .",
    "in contrast , the antisymmetric ( excited ) state will become unstable for @xmath20 , signified by @xmath21 becoming imaginary in this range .",
    "our own numerical simulations of the time evolution of the antisymmetric state seeded with a small amount of noise show the development of angular - momentum josephson junctions similar to those shown in figs .  2 and 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in attractive condensates where @xmath22 , imaginary solutions of @xmath23 for @xmath24 indicate the well - known modulational instability towards the formation of localized peaks ( bright solitons ) in the individual rings .",
    "for the symmetric state , @xmath18 does not add new instabilities ( with imaginary solutions for @xmath25 ) .",
    "the antisymmetric state , however , is further destabilised by the tunnel coupling due to imaginary frequencies of @xmath21 at @xmath26 .",
    "in our analysis so far we have assumed that the sign of the coupling constant @xmath4 is negative .",
    "this lead to the symmetric state with @xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath29 being the ground state .",
    "let us now briefly consider the consequences of the ( hypothetical ) case of a positive coupling constant @xmath30 .",
    "the analysis of sec  [ sec : neg ] can be carried out the same way as before , with the difference that @xmath31 should be replaced by @xmath32 in all formulae .",
    "it is easily seen that , in this case , the antisymmetric state with @xmath33 will be the ground state . since the sign change also affects eq .",
    "( [ eqn : unstable ] ) , we find the antisymmetric state being stable ( for @xmath19 ) and the symmetric one becoming unstable .",

    "( [ chieqs ] ) , we briefly revisit the derivation of this model . for the purpose of finding @xmath4 , the azimuthal degree of freedom in the double - ring model of ref .",
    "@xcite is irrelevant and it suffices to consider the problem of a bec in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) double - well potential , as in refs .",
    "generalisation to multiple wells and different geometries ( coupled cigars or pancakes ) are straightforward .",
    "different derivations of effective two - mode models have been presented in the literature @xcite .",
    "the goal of a two - mode model is generally to correctly describe the ground and low - lying excited states of the system .",
    "the quantity that is obtainable from the 1d model and carries unambiguous information about the sign of the tunnel coupling is the energy difference @xmath39 between the antisymmetric state with one node and the node - less symmetric state . in the simplest case ,",
    "the tunnel coupling @xmath4 is determined from the single - particle linear schrdinger equation .",
    "this approach is commonly used when deriving the fully quantum - mechanical bose - hubbard model @xcite and was the basis of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case both the sign and the value of @xmath4 are completely independent of particle number or interaction strength .",
    "the node theorem of quantum mechanics  @xcite guarantees that the node - less symmetric state in a one - dimensional double - well potential must be the ground state , thus @xmath36 and consequently , the correct sign of @xmath4 is negative .    in a more general class of models based on mean - field theory ,",
    "the parameters of the two - mode model are chosen in order to reproduce @xmath40 as found from a one - dimensional gp equation .",
    "the ordering of eigenvalues of the gp equation by the number of nodes in the wave function is now no longer guaranteed by the node theorem of linear quantum mechanics and we are not aware of a non - linear generalization of this theorem . however , we find by numerical calculation that the ordering is preserved under repulsive interactions . the main result of this section is the dependence of @xmath40 on the non - linear interaction strength @xmath35 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sas ] . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : sas ] , the presence of a repulsive non - linear interaction does not change the sign of @xmath40 and therefore @xmath4 remains negative .",
    "we now present details of our calculation .    starting from the three - dimensional gp equation for a bec in a double - well or double - ring trap and employing a separation ansatz , an effective 1d equation describing the dynamics in the direction perpendicular to the potential barrier can be derived : @xmath41 \\phi(\\xi ) \\ , .\\ ] ] here the energy scale @xmath42 and length scale @xmath43 defined by the trap are used as units for all energies and the spatial coordinate , respectively , and the condensate wave function @xmath44 is normalized to unity .",
    "we introduced the dimensionless interaction strength @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes the number of atoms in the trap and @xmath47 is the effective 1d interaction strength  @xcite . to be specific",
    ", we use the double - well potential @xmath48 where @xmath49 parameterizes the barrier height between the two wells centered at @xmath50 .",
    "it is straightforward to solve eq .",

    "figure  [ fig : wavefunct ] shows typical results obtained for low and high interactions strengths , respectively . as is apparent from the figure , the higher repulsive interaction strength is associated with more strongly delocalized double - well wave functions , indicating an effectively stronger tunnel coupling .",
    "this can be explained simply by noting that the nonlinear interaction energy for the two condensate fractions in each well shifts up their respective energies , thus effectively lowers the barrier and brings the condensates closer together . as a result , the effective tunnel coupling increases .",
    "most importantly , the energy difference between the lowest symmetric and antisymmetric eigenstates remains positive for any strength of repulsive interactions , which implies that the sign of the tunnel coupling @xmath4 entering eq .",

    "the ground state of a non - rotating condensate in the double - ring configuration is stable against spontaneous angular momentum oscillations .",
