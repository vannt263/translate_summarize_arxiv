    "deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments have played important roles in understanding the partonic structure of hadrons and in establishing the theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the strong sector of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "our current knowledge of the parton densities in hadrons is primarily derived from the structure functions measured in these experiments  @xcite .",
    "a precise knowledge of these parton density functions ( pdfs ) is needed both for providing reliable predictions for processes involved in hadron - hadron colliders such as the tevatron and the lhc , and for achieving precision measurements at these colliders .",
    "a good example is the measurement of the mass of the @xmath1 boson from the tevatron .",
    "the mass , which is relevant for incisive tests of the sm of electroweak interactions , receives a non - negligible systematic contribution from the uncertainty of the pdfs  @xcite .",
    "the precision of the pdfs also affects directly interpretations of data measured at hadron colliders and searches for physics beyond the sm .",
    "one example is the excess of jet events at large transverse energies over perturbative qcd calculations reported earlier by the cdf collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the excess , which has initiated considerable speculations of possible new physics , could well be accommodated by a higher than expected gluon density at large @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "another example is the excess of events at high momentum transfer ( @xmath2 ) with respect to the standard dis expectation reported by both the h1 and zeus experiments at hera based on the earlier low statistics sample taken from 1994 to 1996  @xcite .",
    "the excess could be due to a statistical fluctuation , an imprecise knowledge of the pdfs at large @xmath0 , or a resonance production of leptoquarks or scalar quarks in @xmath3-violating supersymmetric models  @xcite .    in this paper , various constraints on the pdfs from fixed - target dis experiments and from hadron - hadron colliders",
    "will first be briefly reviewed ( section  [ sec : constraints ] ) , the inclusive cross - section measurements at high @xmath2 from hera will then be presented and their impact on the pdfs discussed ( section  [ sec : hera ] ) .",
    "the traditional , but still the most important , constraint on the pdfs is from structure function data measured in dis experiments . shown in figure  [ fig : ftdis ] are four precise measurements from bcdms  @xcite , ccfr  @xcite , e665  @xcite and nmc  @xcite and their kinematic ranges  @xcite .",
    "( 50,140 ) ( -120,-10 )    these data constrain the pdfs mainly in the medium and large @xmath0 range is obtained from hera structure function @xmath4 data .",
    "this is , however , not the subject of this paper . ] .",
    "the precision of the structure function data does not , however , imply a good precision for the pdfs since their derivation and error estimation depend on a whole complexity of experimental and theoretical inputs involved in a global analysis such as mrst  @xcite or cteq  @xcite . here",
    "are a number of sources of uncertainty :    * * experimental systematic uncertainties : * the most precise data are usually limited by systematic , rather than statistical , uncertainties .",
    "the correlations of different systematics on the measurements among and across experiments are not at all trivial to take properly into account . * * higher - twist contribution : * the data are located at relative low @xmath2 and large @xmath0 .",
    "the higher - twist contribution is expected to be important as it behaves as @xmath5^{-1}$ ] with respect to the leading - twist contribution . * * parameterization form : * in a global analysis , the parton densities are parameterized in a certain functional form .",
    "the freedom in choosing the functional form and the corresponding initial scale is a source of the uncertainty . * * large nuclear corrections : * as far as the @xmath6 valence quark density is concerned , it is constrained mainly by the deuterium data , to which the nuclear binding corrections can be important .",
    "apart from the structure function data , a few other processes from the fixed - target experiments also provide valuable constraints on the pdfs .",
    "this is the case for the lepton - pair production or the drell - yan process ( the dominant leading - order subprocess being @xmath7 ) , which constrains the sea quark distributions in the proton .",
    "the asymmetry between the @xmath8 and @xmath6 quark flavors , which can not be easily determined from the structure function data , is constrained by the asymmetry in the drell - yan production .",
    "the direct constraint on the gluon density could in principle be obtained from the prompt photon production ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "however , the large discrepancies between measurements and theoretical predictions and among measurements carried out by different experiment groups  @xcite prevent us from using these data at present .",
    "represented in figure  [ fig : dph](a ) are the kinematic ranges for these processes .",
    "figure  [ fig : dph](b ) shows other constraining processes from the collider experiments ua2 , cdf and d0 .",
    "in addition to the direct photon process , the @xmath1 asymmetry constrains the @xmath6 over @xmath8 ratio , @xmath10 , for @xmath0 around 0.1 and for @xmath11 around the mass of the @xmath1 boson .",
    "the inclusive jet data from the tevatron provide a potential source for constraining the gluon density at large @xmath0 .",
    "( 50,140 ) ( -165,95)(a ) ( -130,-10 ) ( 42,95)(b ) ( 85,-10 )    despite the large kinematic coverage of the different data , the resulting uncertainty of various pdfs is far from uniform . in general",
    ", the precision is best in the medium region but still rather poor towards the kinematic limit at large @xmath0 .",
    "this is well illustrated by the behavior of the @xmath10 ratio at @xmath12 ( figure  [ fig : dou ] ) . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the model predictions vary considerably between 0 and 0.5 with non - perturbative qcd - motivated predictions at around 0.2  @xcite . on the experimental side , for @xmath13",
    ", there are precise data from both @xmath1 asymmetry and dis data and the nuclear corrections to the dis data are insignificant ; for @xmath14 , there are only dis data which may be subject to large nuclear corrections ; at larger @xmath0 , no reliable data are available . in an analysis by yang and bodek  @xcite",
    ", they showed that the description of the @xmath1 asymmetry and nmc structure function ratio data is improved with @xmath15 as @xmath12 and with the nuclear binding corrections applied to the deuterium data .",
    "the analysis by kuhlmann  @xcite showed that if the ratio @xmath10 is around 0.2 , the nmc data indeed need a nuclear correction , but the converse is not necessarily true .",
    "the large spread of the curves shown in figure  [ fig : dou ] , corresponding to three possible fits to the existing data , shows how uncertain the current pdfs are at large @xmath0 .",
    "the structure functions measured by the hera experiments h1 and zeus have provided a unique constraint on the pdfs at small @xmath0 , in particular on the gluon density  @xcite . here",
    "we shall present inclusive cross - sections at high @xmath2 measured with three important data samples collected by both experiments since 1994 , and discuss their impact on the pdfs at large @xmath0 .",
    "the first @xmath16 data sample , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.6pb@xmath17 , was taken from 1994 to 1997 at a center - of - mass energy of 300gev .",
    "both the @xmath18 data of 1998 - 1999 and the @xmath16 data of 1999 - 2000 are taken at a center - of - mass energy of 320gev resulting from the increased proton energy of 920gev .",
    "the corresponding integrated luminosities are , respectively , 16.4pb@xmath17 and 65pb@xmath17 .",
    "figure  [ fig : nczeus ] shows the neutral current ( nc ) reduced cross - sections is defined as @xmath19 with @xmath20 . ] measured with the 1996 - 1997 @xmath16 and 1998 - 1999 @xmath18 zeus data  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath18 cross - sections are found to be comparable at low @xmath2 ( @xmath21 or so ) .",
    "this is understood to be due to the dominance of @xmath22 exchange . at higher @xmath2 ,",
    "the @xmath18 cross - sections are measured to be increasingly larger than those of @xmath16 , demonstrating the @xmath23 interference contribution .",
    "the cross - section asymmetry allows the structure function @xmath24 ( figure  [ fig : xf3 ] ) to be determined for the first time at hera  @xcite . as this structure function measures the difference between the quark and anti - quark densities ( @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 being , respectively , the electric charge of quark @xmath28 and its axial coupling to the @xmath29 boson ) , it is thus sensitive to the valence quark densities at large @xmath0 .",
    "a comparison of the charged current ( cc ) reduced cross - sections is defined as @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 being , respectively , the fermi coupling constant and the mass of the exchanged @xmath1 boson . ]",
    "measured by h1  @xcite is shown in figure  [ fig : cch1 ] .",
    "the difference in the cross - sections results mainly from different quark flavors probed by the exchanged @xmath33 bosons .",
    "the cc cross - sections at high @xmath2 thus provide a unique source to directly constrain the @xmath8 and @xmath6 valence quarks at large @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of the measured nc and cc cross - sections  @xcite for @xmath34 and @xmath35 is compared with the standard dis expectation in figure  [ fig : dsdx ] . from the ratio plots , the nc cross - sections at @xmath36",
    "are seen to lie considerably below the expectations , whereas the cc @xmath16 cross - sections at large @xmath0 ( dominated by the @xmath6 valence quark contribution ) have the tendency to lie above the expectation although the uncertainty of both the measurement and the expectation are large .",
    "( 50,400 ) ( -155,-105 ) ( -155,-295 )    in order to quantify the impact of these measurements on the pdfs at large @xmath0 , two methods are employed to extract the @xmath8 and @xmath6 valence quark densities using the hera data alone .",
    "the first method in essence is a global nlo qcd fit like those performed by the mrst and cteq groups  @xcite .",
    "the main difference is in the number of experimental data sets used .",
    "the results of the h1 fit  @xcite are shown in figure  [ fig : h1udv ] together with those obtained from a second method . in the second method ,",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath6 quark densities are extracted locally from the measured cross - sections @xmath37 as : @xmath38 where the second factor on the right - hand - side of the equation is the theoretical expectation .",
    "only those points where the @xmath39 contribution is greater than 70% of the corresponding cross - section are considered .",
    "the first such extraction was performed by h1 for two values of @xmath0 at 0.25 and 0.4 using the 1994 - 1997 @xmath16 nc and cc cross - sections  @xcite . with the new @xmath18 1998 - 1999 and @xmath16 1999 - 2000 data ,",
    "similar extractions were made and were extended to @xmath36 for @xmath8  @xcite . in practice , the @xmath6 valence quark density is determined from the combined @xmath16 cc cross - sections , whereas the @xmath8 valence quark density is determined from the combined @xmath16 nc , @xmath18 nc and @xmath18 cc cross - sections .",
    "three independent determinations of @xmath40 are then combined .",
    "( 50,370 ) ( -145,-125 )    the valence quark distributions at large @xmath0 can thus be quantitatively constrained for the first time by the hera data alone although the experimental uncertainties ( between 6% at @xmath41 and @xmath42% at @xmath36 for @xmath40 and @xmath43% for @xmath44 ) are still large .",
    "the determined parton densities agree well with those parameterizations , which use the fixed - target data as the main constraining source , except for @xmath40 at @xmath36 , where the former is about @xmath45% lower than the latter with little dependence on @xmath2 in the covered kinematic range .",
    "the difference ( less than two standard deviations ) remains however not very significant .",
    "similar results  @xcite from zeus based on an nlo qcd fit using zeus data only are shown in figure  [ fig : zeusudv ] . in comparison with the global qcd fit which uses both the fixed - target data and the 1996 - 1997 @xmath16 zeus data ,",
    "the zeus data prefer a larger @xmath40 for @xmath0 around 0.2 and smaller @xmath40 at larger @xmath0 . a shift towards large @xmath0",
    "is also observed in the @xmath44 distribution although the shift stays essentially within the uncertainty .",
    "the structure function and other measurements from fixed - target dis and hadron - hadron collider experiments have provided us important inputs for constraining the parton density distributions . in the past few years",
    "there has been a renewed interest in the parton density distributions at large @xmath0 , in particular the behavior of the @xmath10 ratio when @xmath12 .",
    "considerable progress has been made towards understanding some of the uncertainties in the individual measurements that contribute to our knowledge of the large-@xmath0 parton distributions .",
    "the current situation is that the large-@xmath0 distributions are less well constrained than the medium-@xmath0 ones and need additional inputs for improvements .",
    "hera has made steady progress since 1992 .",
    "the early runs have provided unique structure function data for settling the behavior of parton ( in particular the gluon ) densities at small @xmath0 .",
    "the high statistics samples taken in the recent years now allow the inclusive cross - sections be measured for both neutral and charged current interactions at high @xmath2 .",
    "these cross - sections have started to give quantitative constraints on the valence quark densities at large @xmath0 .",
    "hera is finishing its upgrade program .",
    "after the upgrade , the machine will provide about a factor of five increase in the peak luminosity and polarized lepton beams .",
    "the upgraded machine and the improved detectors will thus significantly improve in the next few years the measurement of the cross - sections and the knowledge of the parton densities at large @xmath0 .",
    "these data are unique as they are free from any nuclear corrections inherent in the structure function data of the deuteron .",
    "there are other possibilities by which the @xmath8 and @xmath6 valence quark densities at large @xmath0 can be further constrained .",
    "one possibility  @xcite is to use semi - inclusive dis data on hadron production in the current fragmentation region to measure the relative yields of @xmath46 and @xmath47 mesons .",
    "the idea is fairly simple : at large @xmath48 ( @xmath48 being the fractional energy of the hadron ) , the @xmath8 quark fragments primarily into a @xmath46 , while a @xmath6 fragments into a @xmath47 , so that at large @xmath0 and @xmath48 one could have a direct measure of the @xmath10 ratio , again free from the nuclear corrections when a proton target is used .    ( 50,490 ) ( -125,220 ) ( -125,-0 )    on the large-@xmath0 gluon density , future improvements are expected from the direct photon data once the current discrepancies between the data and the predictions and among the data are resolved .",
    "the improved tevatron jet data at runii should also help .",
    "a third possibility  @xcite is to use the drell - yan process in the phase space where the leading - order subprocess @xmath49 dominates .",
    "the uncertainties of the parton density distributions translate directly into uncertainties in essentially every measurement made at a hadron - hadron collider ; it is therefore imperative that these distributions be well determined .",
    "the author wishes to thank his colleagues in the h1 and zeus collaborations for the measurements presented in this paper .",
    "he also thanks the organizers of the workshop for the invitation and for the unique hospitality at the ringberg castle ."
