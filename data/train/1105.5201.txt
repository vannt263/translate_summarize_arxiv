    "[ sec : general ] when studying random walks in environments that are non - elliptic ( some nearest - neighbour steps may not be allowed from some locations ) , one should first consider the connectivity structure of the directed graphs that are induced by such environments . in this paper , we introduce such random graphs in a general setting , with particular emphasis on models that connect to infinitely many sites almost surely .",

    "<S> as with percolation models , many of the models we consider admit , or are expected to admit phase transitions . among the main results of the paper is a proof of the existence of phase transitions for some two - dimensional models that are non - monotone in their underlying parameter , and an improved bound on the critical value for oriented site percolation on the triangular lattice . the connectivity of the random directed graphs provides a foundation for understanding the asymptotic properties of random walks in these random environments , which we study in a second paper .    </S>",
