    "the delayed onset of solar cycle 24 , after one of the deepest solar minimum experienced in the past 100 years has had significant solar and heliospheric consequences .",
    "solar cycle 23 has been characterized by a steady decline in solar activity @xcite , a continuous weakening of polar fields @xcite and a decline in micro - turbulence levels in the inner heliosphere since @xmath21995 @xcite .",
    "investigations of the boundary of polar coronal holes during the declining phase of solar cycle 23 using images from the extreme ultraviolet imaging telescope ( eit ) on board the solar heliospheric observatory ( soho ) , have found a decrease in coronal hole area by @xmath215@xmath3 in comparison to that at the beginning of solar cycle 23 @xcite . using both ground - based and space - borne observations of photospheric magnetic fields @xcite and theoretical modeling @xcite ,",
    "there have been continuous efforts to investigate and understand the behavior of solar photospheric fields and their correlation with meridional flows , to try and explain the delayed onset of cycle 24 and the cause of the deep minimum at the end of cycle 23 .",
    "magnetic field measurements using data from the national solar observatory , kitt peak ( nso / kp ) synoptic magnetogram database , have shown that a decline in solar photospheric fields in the latitude range 45@xmath1 to 78@xmath1 began around the minimum of solar cycle 22 , in @xmath21995@xmath41996 @xcite .",
    "however , the dipole field of the sun behaved differently .",
    "it was at its strongest in 1995 , weakened at solar maximum around 2000 , and then increased between @xmath22000 and 2004 @xcite .",
    "signatures of this decline in solar fields above latitude @xmath045@xmath1 have also been observed in the inner heliosphere as a corresponding decline in micro - turbulence levels which in turn , tie into small scale interplanetary magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the decline in micro - turbulence levels was inferred from extensive interplanetary scintillation ( ips ) observations at 327 mhz in the period 1983@xmath42009 @xcite .",
    "using this fact _ viz . _",
    "that both solar magnetic fields and micro - turbulence levels in the inner - heliosphere have been declining since mid 1990 s , @xcite have argued that the build - up to the deep and extended solar minimum at the end of cycle 23 was actually initiated as early as the mid-1990 s",
    ".    one method of gaining insights into underlying basic processes in the solar interior , that govern the nature and evolution of solar photospheric magnetic fields , is by studying periodicities produced by various surface activity features at different times in the solar cycle .",
    "for example , the 158 days ( d ) rieger periodicity reported in the solar flare occurrence rates @xcite has been linked to the periodic emergence of magnetic flux through the photosphere which in turn gives rise to a periodic variation of the total sunspot area on the solar surface .",
    "similarly , a strong 1.3 years ( yr ) periodicity detected at the base of the solar convection zone , through a helioseismic study @xcite , has also been detected in sunspot areas and sunspot number time series studied using wavelet transforms @xcite .",
    "these authors have in fact proposed that the 154@xmath5158 d rieger period is a harmonic of the 1.3 yr periodicity ( 3@xmath6156 d = 1.28 yr ) and that variations in the rotation rate have a strong influence on the workings of the solar dynamo @xcite .    in this paper , in order to understand the role of periodic changes , if any , in the solar photospheric fields leading to the build - up of the recent deep minimum at the end of cycle 23 , data from the nso / kp synoptic magnetic database during the period 1975.14  @xmath4  2009.86 were subjected to detailed spectral analyses using both wavelet and fourier techniques .",
    "it has been shown that a significant north - south asymmetry in the quasi - periodic variations of the photospheric magnetic fields exist both prior to and after 1996 ( with 1996 being a clear transition period ) almost 12 yr before the deep minimum period in 2008@xmath42009 .",
    "prominent periodicities related to the solar cycle , apart from the well known synodic rotation period of @xmath227 d and the sunspot activity cycle of @xmath211 yr , have been a topic of interest for over two decades now .",
    "using data from the gamma ray spectrometer @xcite onboard the solar maximum mission , a clear 154 d periodicity in the occurrence rate of high energy ( 0.3 - 100 mev ) flares has been reported @xcite .",
    "this 154 d periodicity in the solar flare occurrence was also confirmed at other wavelengths @xcite , and for solar energetic particle events @xcite .",
    "in addition , other intermediate periodicities with periods ( @xmath71 yr ) have also been reported _",

    "studies of all these periodicities have shown the existence of an asymmetry in solar activity phenomena between the northern and southern hemispheres of the sun .",

    "since the normalized periodograms are generated from measurements of magnetic fields , it is a proxy for the behaviour of the photospheric magnetic fields and a north - south asymmetry would imply a similar asymmetry in photospheric magnetic fields towards higher solar latitudes before and after 1996 .",

    "similarly , the lower half of the table [ t - tab - high ] lists significant periodicities for the low - latitude fields with periods ranging in between 134 d to 288 d. the bottom four panels - e , f , g , h in fig [ f - asym - fields - high ] show a few of these periodicities with their spectral power .",

    "our wavelet analysis shows a transition occurring around 1996 in the distribution of power and periodicities of photospheric fields .",
    "when the data were partitioned into periods prior to and after 1996 a hemispheric asymmetry is seen in the derived fourier periodicities of solar magnetic activity above latitudes of @xmath045@xmath1 .",
    "a more detailed analysis shows that this asymmetry is confined to the latitude band 45@xmath1@xmath460@xmath1 in both hemispheres .",
    "this latitude band is primarily dominated by strong , episodic poleward surges or tongues of magnetic flux in both hemispheres which , as stated earlier , are a direct surface manifestation of the meridional flow and the internal solar dynamo . in the 60@xmath1@xmath475@xmath1 latitude band",
    "we find an asymmetry in the distribution of spectral power in the longer periods since the photospheric surface fields have saturated in this band .",
    "this observed and localized asymmetry , confined to the 45@xmath1@xmath460@xmath1 latitude zone in both hemispheres , when coupled with the fact that both solar fields and the micro - turbulence levels in the inner - heliosphere have been decreasing since early to mid nineties suggests that active changes occurred around this time in the solar dynamo that governs the underlying basic processes in the sun .",
    "these changes in turn probably initiated the build - up to one of the deepest solar minima , at the end of the cycle 23 , experienced in the past 100 years .",
    "the magnetic time series in both the solar hemispheres exhibit a multitude of periodicities with significant variation in the spectral power of midterm ( 1@xmath42 year ) periodicities before and after 1996 .",
    "these prominent periods in the lower solar latitudes , below @xmath2945@xmath1 , are thought to originate as the result of stochastic processes caused by the periodic emergence of surface magnetic flux @xcite as the solar cycle progresses . as stated earlier ,",
    "@xcite have reported a 1.3 year periodicity at the base of the solar convection zone , which has also been detected in sunspot areas and sunspot number time series studied using wavelet transforms @xcite .",
    "these findings have led to the conclusion that the mid - term fluctuations in the solar fields are surface manifestations of changes in the magnetic fluxes generated deep inside the sun .     to 78@xmath1 for solar cycles 22 and 23 .",
    "it is clear that the north solar field has reversed while the south solar field is still to do so .",
    "the time of reversal of the north solar field is indicated by a small blue arrow.,width=453,height=453 ]    polar surges above latitudes @xmath2945@xmath1 show significant variations in their occurrence rates and strength in each cycle and will therefore show up as a variation in spectral power and periods . a comparison of polar surges in the last three solar cycles , _ viz .",
    "_ 21 , 22 , and 23 , reveals that they are comparatively more in strength after around solar maximum .",
    "though we have restricted our analysis to data from cycles 21 , 22 and 23 in the period from @xmath21975  @xmath4  2010 , an examination of data beyond 2010 shows an asymmetry in the solar field reversal at high - latitudes .",
    "figure [ f - reversal - assym ] shows the reversal of the northern high latitude field in cycle 24 in march 2011 .",
    "however , the southern hemisphere is yet to undergo a reversal . the filled black dots in fig .",
    "[ f - reversal - assym ] are the actual measurements while the red solid line is a smoothed curve .",
    "the reversal of the solar polar field occurs at times when the red curve passes through zero and is indicated for cycle 24 by a small blue line in the northern hemisphere .",
    "while it is known from earlier cycles that the two hemispheres do not reverse polarities at the same time , the time lag between the reversal of the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere has , to the best of our knowledge , never been as large .",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite , using the theory of meridional circulation , have reported an asymmetry in the latitudinal extent of the sun s meridional flow belt in the cycle 22 and 23 wherein surface meridional flows in cycle 22 extend to latitudes of @xmath2960@xmath1 while in cycle 23 , it went all the way to the poles",
    ". thus , the meridional flow in cycle 23 , took a longer time thereby causing a slower return flow which led in turn to the extended solar minimum in cycle 23 .",
    "recent work , using helioseismic data from the birmingham solar oscillation network ( bison ) , an instrument that is very sensitive in probing the solar interior close to the solar surface , has shown that the behavior of solar oscillation frequencies in the sub - surface magnetic layers during the descending phase of cycle 23 was significantly different from that during cycle 22 @xcite .",
    "these authors went on to state that the peculiar solar minimum , at the end of the cycle 23 , could have been predicted long before it happened .",
    "the present work , showing a north - south asymmetry around mid 1990 s in the quasi - periodic variations of photospheric fields at high - latitudes shows that changes were initiated at this time in the basic underlying solar dynamo processes like the meridional flow rates and the magnetic flux emergence that eventually led to the prolonged and deep minimum that we have just witnessed .",
    "the current understanding of the solar dynamo is that it operates through the babcock - leighton mechanism to produce poloidal fields through the decay of tilted bipolar sunspots @xcite .",
    "the strength of the polar field , at each solar maximum then depends upon the tilt angle in bipolar sunspots which , in turn , is determined by the action of the coriolis force acting on magnetic flux tubes that reach the surface by rising through the turbulent convection zone @xcite .",
    "this process causes a large scatter in the average tilt - angle causing the polar field to be randomly weaker or stronger than in the previous cycle @xcite .",
    "we have observed a decline in fields above 45@xmath1 for the past @xmath215 years implying weak polar fields being generated in two successive solar cycles _ viz .",
    "_  cycles 22 and 23 .",
    "a continuation of this declining trend beyond 22 years would imply a third successive weak polar field imparted by the babcock - leighton mechanism .",
    "this is probably unlikely as the polar field is imparted by a random process and if it happens it would have serious implications on our present understanding of the solar dynamo . also , two of the eight strongest geomagnetic storms in the last 150 years have occurred during solar cycles 13 and 14 which were both relatively weak cycles . therefore , continued observations and measurements of solar magnetic fields are extremely important .",
