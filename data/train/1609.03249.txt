    "the 8.2-m subaru telescope has been running a 300-night strategic survey program ( ssp ) over 5 years since 2014 march , in order to elucidate the mystery of dark matter and dark energy as well as the evolution of galaxies .",
    "the survey utilizes hyper suprime - cam ( hsc ; @xcite ) with a wide field of view of 1.77 square degrees . in 201618",
    ", we observe two ultra deep fields , cosmos and sxds , for six - month each .",
    "the observations will be performed around the new moon in each month , with a typical cadence of 34 days .",
    "note that the hsc is not installed on subaru for two weeks around the full moon . among other transient surveys , the subaru hsc / ssp survey is the deepest for this survey area ( @xmath0 square degrees ) , and thus , will provide the unique dataset for transients .",
    "for example , the hsc / ssp survey will triple the number of type - ia supernovae ( sne ) beyond redshift @xmath1 and will also discover a few tens of superluminous sne at @xmath1 .",
    "difference imaging is the standard method to search for optical transient objects , and so we use it in this study .",
    "we define a transient object as the one that appears only in the image at the later epoch ( newer image ) , but not in the one at the earlier epoch ( reference image or template image ) , out of the two images taken at different epochs .",
    "after the standard data reduction is made , two images are astrometrically aligned , and the reference image is subtracted from the newer image by matching point spread functions ( psfs ) of the two images .",
    "the source - finding algorithm is applied to the difference image , and the detected sources are the candidates of transients ( section [ sec : data analysis and feature extraction ] ) .        in an ideal situation , all the sources detected in difference images would be transient / variable astronomical sources , such as supernovae , variable stars , moving objects , and so on .",
    "in reality , however , they also include artifacts ( see panels a  i in figure [ fig : bogus_sample ] ) , such as cosmic - ray events , spikes around bright stars , and residuals related to inaccurate image convolution or astrometric alignment .",
    "these artifacts are present in every optical survey project @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we call them `` bogus '' @xcite .    in the hsc / ssp survey , not only a few hundred transients , including sne , but also @xmath2 bogus objects are expected to be detected each night .",
    "after the scheduled 300 nights , the number of candidates of transients , real and bogus combined , will reach @xmath3 , which is well qualified as big data .",
    "we need to filter out bogus objects to select sne and other real transients .",
    "processing of filtering must be performed swiftly in order to increase the chances of new findings in an early phase of transient phenomena .",
    "the primary method to distinguish transient / bogus objects is , traditionally , visual inspection by human checkers , as many surveys have been adopting .",
    "however , the expected size of our data is so big that human checkers would not be able to go through all the data in a reasonable time .",
    "we have decided to introduce machine - learning ( ml ) techniques to select real transients .    in the filtering process",
    ", we should not miss real objects , while a vast number of bogus objects are filtered out . throughout the development",
    ", we try to minimize the false positive rate ( fpr ) , while we maintain the true positive rate ( tpr ) of 90 % or larger ( namely the false negative rate , fnr @xmath4 ) .",
    "we performed two hsc observations in 2015 may and august @xcite , aiming to detect short transients with a time scale of a few hours to a few days ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "an example of such short transients is an optical flash at the time of shock breakout of a supernova , of which the time - variance would be detectable during an observation for a single night .",
    "we use three kinds of ml methods , auc boosting , random forests ( rf ) , and deep neural network ( dnn ) , both individually and in a combined way .",
    "we verify the performance of these machines by making the receiver operation characteristic ( roc ) curves .",
    "conditions of observations ( the noise and seeing ) vary every night .",
    "hence , the ml classifiers must be robust against the change of environment .",
    "we use normalized features to reduce the influence of the variation . to validate the performance of our method",
    ", we show the roc curves of our machine trained with the data on one - night observation , applied to the data on the other night observation .",
    "the results show the proposed classifier is robust .    in optical surveys ,",
    "ml techniques have been introduced by @xcite for the data from the nearby supernova factory .",
    "they applied boosted decision trees , rf , and support vector machines ( svm ) and succeeded in reducing the number of bogus candidates by a factor of ten .",
    "the palomar transient factory team @xcite used rf , and achieved the tpr of 92.3% at the fpr of 1% @xcite .",
    "the pan - starrs1 medium deep survey used artificial neural network , svm and rf , and achieved tpr of 90% at fpr of 1% @xcite .",
    "@xcite applied the rf for dark energy survey supernova program ( des - sn ) , and reduced the number of transient candidates by a factor of 13.4 , which were then fed to human scanning . @xcite applied the rf , @xmath5-nearest neighbor , and the skynet artificial neural net algorithm , using features trained from eigen - image analysis for the sloan digital sky survey supernova survey .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : data analysis and feature extraction ] , we explain the hsc data reduction and feature extractions . in section  [ sec : ml ] , we introduce three machine learning methods we used . in section  [ sec : experiment ] , the applications to the actual subaru data are presented , and then we discuss the result of real vs bogus segregation in section  [ sec : discussion and conclusion ] .    prior to the forthcoming hsc / ssp transient survey , this paper will provide a ` path finder ' to identify real astronomical objects and to demonstrate the power of machine learning .",
    ".list of the features [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     table [ table : number of selected objects ] summarizes the numbers of selected objects obtained with the three individual machines and with the combined machines , where the thresholds are set at the points corresponding to the tpr of 90% . in order not to miss the real objects",
    ", we adopted the `` majority voting '' for the combined machines , and it reduced the number of objects to @xmath6 .    among 48 supernovae obtained with the may observation ,",
    "26 are in the magnitude range of 22.0  25.0 mag .",
    "we applied the combined machine of `` majority voting '' with the threshold of tpr of 90% at this magnitude range .",
    "then , 22 sources , or 85% of them , were accepted .      before the august observation",
    ", we had installed the trained machines in order to run transient search immediately after the observation ( see section [ sec : result sel sn ] ) .",
    "we then visually inspected every object detected , selected ten clean sources as definite candidates of supernovae , and reported the list to astronomers telegram @xcite .",
    "this whole process was carried out within the same day as the observation .",
    "we performed subaru / hsc observations in 2015 may and august , made transient searches , and applied machine - learning techniques to the result to reduce the bogus transient objects .",
    "we have developed real - bogus classifiers as the core function for it , using the three machine - learning methods of auc boosting , random forests , and deep neural network , and then made the combined classifier as their majority voting .",
    "we have installed our machines in the analysis pipeline of the hsc , and successfully found real supernovae within the same day as the observation , demonstrating the power of our method .",
    "now , we have completed the preparation for the forthcoming hsc / ssp transient survey observation .    in training our machines , we used artificial objects , because the data are highly imbalanced between real / bogus objects , and it was found to be crucial to make good machines efficiently . although the hsc survey data are technically more difficult to deal with than other survey data , given that the hsc survey is deeper than other surveys , we have achieved the results comparable to the similar studies in other surveys .",
    "the cross - relations between three machines in figure [ fig : score_scat3_sel10 ] show that none of the three is significantly better than the other two .",
    "therefore , combining the machines is beneficial .",
    "we used a moderate selection with all the combinations of multiple machines , `` majority voting '' , to avoid missing some real objects . for the machine , robustness against variation of environment was confirmed .    in this paper",
    "we have focused on real - bogus separation with machine - learning methods , and have demonstrated that they were indeed useful .",
    "their use in extracting scientific results out of big - data in astronomy is promising . as the next step",
    ", we will use machine - learning for classification of types of transients , by combining timing and color information , as well as the shape of objects .",
    "we thank the subaru hyper suprime - cam team .",
    "this work is supported by core research for evolutionary science and technology ( crest ) , japan science and technology agency ( jst ) .",
