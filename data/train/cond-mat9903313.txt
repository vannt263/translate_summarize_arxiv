    "over the course of the last few decades , the density functional theory ( dft ) of hohenberg , kohn , and sham@xcite has proven to be an accurate and reliable basis for the ab initio calculation of a wide variety of materials properties .",
    "but the solution of the kohn - sham equations is a formidable task , and this has significantly limited the range of physical systems which can be considered .    among the most popular methods of solving the equations",
    "has been the plane - wave ( pw ) method  typically coupled with pseudopotentials to eliminate core electrons.@xcite for all its advantages , however , the pw method has some notable disadvantages with respect to the solution of large problems .",
    "first , because the pw basis functions are not local in real space , they give rise to a dense hamiltonian matrix which in turn limits the effectiveness of iterative solution methods.@xcite second , the method requires fourier transforms which are difficult to implement efficiently on massively parallel architectures due to the need for non - local communications . finally , the pw basis has the same resolution at all points in space , which causes considerable difficulties in the treatment of highly localized systems such as first - row elements and transition metals .",
    "recent progress on this problem has included ultrasoft pseudopotentials,@xcite optimized pseudopotentials,@xcite and adaptive coordinate transformations.@xcite    the limitations of the pw approach have inspired the development of various `` real - space '' approaches including finite - difference ( fd),@xcite finite - element ( fe),@xcite and wavelet@xcite methods . of these , perhaps the most mature and successful to date have been the fd methods .",
    "these methods produce sparse , structured hamiltonian ( and in some cases , overlap ) matrices , require no fourier transforms , and allow for some degree of variable resolution in real space . but to achieve these advantages , these methods give up the use of a basis and work instead by discretizing individual terms of the differential equation of interest on a real - space grid . as a result , quantities of interest are defined only at a discrete set of points in space , limiting the accuracy of integrations and complicating the handling of singular functions such as all - electron potentials . and",
    "as a further consequence , the methods are not variational : the error can be of either sign and convergence is often from below .",
    "finite - element methods @xcite achieve the significant advantages of fd methods without giving up the use of a basis .",
    "like the pw method , the fe method is an expansion method . in the fe method , however , the basis functions are strictly local , piecewise polynomials .",
    "a simple 1-d example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( which we discuss further below ) .",
    "because the basis is composed of polynomials , it is completely general and the convergence of the method can be controlled systematically by increasing the number or order of basis functions . because the basis functions are strictly local in real space , the method achieves the significant advantages of fd approaches : the method produces sparse , structured matrices , which in turn enable the effective use of iterative solution methods .",
    "the method requires no fourier transforms , as all calculations are performed in real space . and",
    "the method allows for variable resolution in real space ",
    "more so than fd approaches  by increasing the number or order of basis functions where needed .",
    "the method thus combines the significant advantages of both real - space - grid and basis - oriented approaches .",
    "some disadvantages of fe methods are that the matrices produced tend to be less sparse , and often less simply structured , than those produced by fd methods , and that these matrices must be stored .",
    "in addition , fe methods produce generalized rather than standard eigenvalue problems , as produced by many fd approaches , and they can be significantly more difficult to implement than fd or pw approaches .    the fe method@xcite has had a long history of success in quite diverse applications ranging from civil engineering to quantum mechanics .",
    "applications in engineering go back to the 1950s .",
    "applications to the electronic - structure of isolated atomic and molecular systems began to appear as early as the 1970s.@xcite white , wilkins , and teter@xcite applied the method to full 3-d atomic and molecular calculations in 1989 and demonstrated the advantageous scaling of the method with the number of basis functions , afforded by the strict locality and real - space nature of the basis .    there have , however , been relatively few applications to solids .",
    "hermansson and yevick@xcite applied the fe method to full 3-d solid - state electronic - structure calculations in 1986 , but having reached a negative conclusion in the study of small systems with uniform meshes , discussed their approach only generally and , though apparently capable of arbitrary brillouin zone sampling , reported only @xmath0-point results .",
    "more recently , tsuchida and tsukada@xcite have applied the method to full 3-d molecular and solid - state electronic - structure calculations .",
    "they have implemented self - consistency , non - uniform meshes , adaptive coordinate transformations , pseudopotential and all - electron calculations , and have demonstrated the favorable efficiency of the method relative to fd approaches .",
    "their solid - state results have , however , also been limited to the @xmath0-point .",
    "here , we present a full 3-d fe approach to solid - state electronic - structure calculations which allows arbitrary sampling of the brillouin zone and report , to our knowledge , the first such band structures calculated by the method . our development differs from that of ref .   in",
    "that we have taken a galerkin approach.@xcite our development is closer to that of ferrari,@xcite who developed a galerkin approach allowing arbitrary sampling of the brillouin zone in the context of 2-d super - lattice calculations .",
    "as we have not yet implemented self - consistency , our results here are limited to model potentials and empirical pseudopotentials .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ method ] we discuss the details of our approach .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ method : basis ] with a description of the basis . in sec .",
    "[ method : discret ] we show how the basis can be applied to the solution of the schrdinger equation subject to boundary conditions appropriate to a periodic solid . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we present results for a model potential and si pseudopotential , including band structures and details of the convergence of the method .",
    "the conclusions in sec .",
    "[ summary ] are followed by an appendix giving the details of the particular 3-d basis which we employ .",
    "finite - element bases consist of strictly local , piecewise polynomials .",
    "they are constructed generally as follows : the domain is partitioned into subdomains called _",
    "elements_. within each element a set of polynomial basis functions is defined .",
    "these element polynomials are then pieced together at inter - element boundaries to form the piecewise polynomial basis functions of the method . in order to apply the method to periodic problems ,",
    "we take the additional step here of piecing together element polynomials across the domain boundary.@xcite    the essential ideas are perhaps best conveyed by a simple example : a 1-d , periodic , piecewise - linear basis .",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) shows the complete basis and figs .",
    "[ fig1](b)(e ) show the individual basis functions . in this case , the domain @xmath1 $ ] has been partitioned into four elements . for simplicity",
    "we have defined a uniform partition but this need not be the case in general . within each element , two linear polynomial basis functions have been defined to make the basis complete to linear order.@xcite more and higher - order polynomials can be used to increase the order of completeness . figure [ fig1](b ) shows the basis function which results from piecing together element polynomials across the domain boundary .",
    "figures [ fig1](c)(e ) show the basis functions which result from piecing together element polynomials across inter - element boundaries .",
    "note that the resulting basis functions are @xmath2-continuous , i.e. , continuous but not necessarily smooth.@xcite smoother bases can be constructed by requiring continuity of higher derivatives ( which would require higher - order polynomials ) , but a @xmath2 basis offers a unique and potentially significant advantage : an efficient and natural representation of the wavefunction and charge density cusps which occur in all - electron calculations and which cause such difficulty for conventional , necessarily smooth bases  and for fd approaches as well , as they also assume some degree of derivative continuity .",
    "we have therefore chosen a @xmath2 basis for our approach .",
    "the application of such a basis , however , to the solution of a second - order differential equation , with periodic boundary conditions in particular , requires some consideration .",
    "first , the application of the laplacian to such functions is clearly problematic .",
    "second , referring again to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , note that the basis is value - periodic , i.e. , @xmath3 but not derivative - periodic , i.e. , it is _ not _ the case for all basis functions that @xmath4 thus , the satisfaction of periodic boundary conditions is nontrivial .",
    "we address these issues in sec .",
    "[ method : discret ] .    referring again to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , note also that the basis functions take on a value of _ one _ at their associated nodes and _ zero _ at all others , i.e. , @xmath5 thus , a fe expansion , @xmath6 is such that @xmath7 giving the expansion coefficients a direct real - space meaning .",
    "finally , and perhaps most significantly , we note that the basis functions are strictly local in real space , i.e. , nonzero over only a ( typically small ) fraction of the domain .",
    "it is this property of the basis which allows the method to achieve the significant advantages of fd approaches .    in our calculations ,",
    "we have employed a 3-d , @xmath2 , piecewise - cubic basis .",
    "many other choices are possible . higher - order completeness generally leads to smaller matrices and higher - order convergence , but also to less sparseness .",
    "the details of the basis are given in the appendix .",
    "we solve @xmath8 in a unit cell , where @xmath9 is an arbitrary periodic potential , as appropriate for a periodic solid .",
    "we begin by reducing the bloch - periodic problem to a periodic one .",
    "since @xmath9 is periodic , we can take @xmath10 to be of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a complex , cell - periodic function satisfying @xmath13 for all lattice vectors @xmath14 .",
    "substitution of the form ( [ e7 ] ) into ( [ e6 ] ) then gives @xmath15 from the periodicity condition ( [ e8 ] ) , we take the boundary conditions to be : @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the surfaces of the boundary @xmath0 and associated lattice vectors shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , and @xmath20 is the outward unit normal at @xmath21 .",
    "we denote the domain by @xmath22 and take it to be a parallelepiped for definiteness .",
    "the problem is thus reduced to eqs.([e9])([e11 ] ) .    to facilitate the use of a @xmath2 basis",
    ", we next derive an equivalent `` variational formulation '' of the problem .",
    "the inner product of the differential equation ( [ e9 ] ) with an arbitrary `` test function '' @xmath23 gives @xmath24     \\,d\\omega } \\,=0    .\\ ] ] since @xmath23 is arbitrary , the integral equation ( [ e12 ] ) is equivalent to the differential equation ( [ e9 ] ) . to reduce the order of the highest derivative and produce a boundary term ( whose usefulness will become clear subsequently ) , we integrate the @xmath25 term by parts:@xcite @xmath26\\,d\\omega } = 0    .\\ ] ] to incorporate the `` natural '' boundary condition ( [ e11 ] ) , we now restrict @xmath23 to @xmath27 i.e. , to satisfy the `` essential '' boundary condition ( [ e10 ] ) .",
    "then , using the fact that the domain is a parallelepiped , the boundary term can be written as @xmath28 \\cdot \\hat { \\bf n } d\\gamma , \\ ] ] which vanishes upon the assertion of the natural boundary condition ( [ e11 ] ) .",
    "thus , with the restriction ( [ e14 ] ) , the differential equation and natural boundary condition together imply the integral equation , @xmath29d\\omega } = 0    .\\ ] ] finally , using again the arbitrariness of @xmath23 , it can be shown that the converse also holds , and thus that the differential formulation ( [ e9])-([e11 ] ) is in fact equivalent to the following _ variational formulation _ : find the scalars @xmath30 and functions @xmath31 such that @xmath32d\\omega } = 0\\;\\;\\forall v\\in { \\bf v } .\\ ] ] we have thus reformulated the original problem in such a way that ( 1 ) the highest derivative which occurs is of order one , and ( 2 ) only the essential boundary condition remains  the natural boundary condition having been built into the equation itself .",
    "the problem is thus now in a form which is suitable for approximate solution in a @xmath2 fe basis since all terms are well defined for such functions and since such a basis can be readily constructed to satisfy the required value - periodicity ( e.g.  fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    to find an approximate solution , we now restrict @xmath23 and @xmath12 to a finite - dimensional subspace @xmath33 . the problem",
    "is then reduced to : find the scalars @xmath30 and functions @xmath34 such that @xmath35d\\omega } = 0\\;\\;\\forall v\\in { \\bf v}_n    .\\ ] ] we proceed by constructing a real @xmath2 fe basis , @xmath36 , which satisfies the remaining essential boundary condition and so spans a subspace @xmath37 ( e.g.  fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we then express @xmath12 as a complex linear combination , @xmath38 so that @xmath34 .",
    "substitution of the expansion ( [ e18 ] ) , and the fact that ( [ e17 ] ) is satisfied @xmath39 if it is satisfied for @xmath40 , @xmath41 , leads finally to a generalized eigenproblem for the coefficients @xmath42 and eigenvalues @xmath30 determining the approximate eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the variational formulation , and thus of the original problem : @xmath43 where @xmath44\\,d\\omega } \\ ] ] and @xmath45 as in the pw method , given the expansion of the potential , the above matrix elements can be evaluated exactly , due to the polynomial nature of the basis .",
    "as in the fd method , the above matrices are sparse and structured , due to the strict locality of the basis .",
    "we have tested our approach in a number of applications ranging from the band structure of si to positron charge distributions in @xmath46 . here",
    "we present results which demonstrate the accuracy and convergence of the method for a model potential , for which analytic results are available , and for the more physically interesting case of si .",
    "figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] show results for a 3-d generalized kronig - penney model potential : @xmath47 where @xmath48 figure [ fig3 ] shows the band structure obtained with a 6x6x6 uniform mesh vs.  analytic results at selected k - points , for @xmath49 ry , @xmath50 a.u . , and @xmath51 a.u .",
    "more quantitative information is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] which shows the convergence of the fractional error @xmath52 of the first few eigenvalues with increasing numbers of elements , at an arbitrary k - point .",
    "the variational nature of the method is clearly demonstrated : the errors are strictly positive and monotonically decreasing .",
    "the consistent , sextic convergence of the method is also clearly demonstrated : the asymptotic slope of @xmath53 on the log - log scale corresponds to an error of @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the mesh spacing , consistent with fe asymptotic convergence theorems for the cubic - complete case.@xcite    figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] show results for a si pseudopotential.@xcite since our approach allows for the direct treatment of an arbitrary parallelepiped domain , we show results for a two - atom primitive cell .",
    "in contrast , recent fd approaches have been limited to a small subset of bravais lattices and have reported only supercell results for si .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the sequence of band structures obtained for 3x3x3 , 4x4x4 , and 6x6x6 uniform meshes vs.  exact values at selected k - points .",
    "( here `` exact values '' are from a highly converged pw calculation , using a 54 ry cutoff . ) the variational nature and rapid convergence of the method are again clearly demonstrated . also apparent in the very coarse 3x3x3 results , are the inexact degeneracies of certain eigenvalues at high - symmetry k - points : for example , the splitting at the @xmath0-point of the triply degenerate value at the top of the valence band and the splitting at the x - point of the doubly degenerate lowest value . as noted in ref .",
    ", this is due to the fact that the basis is not constrained to have the full symmetry of the crystal .",
    "thus , to the extent that the eigenvalues are approximate , so are the degeneracies ; and as the eigenvalues converge , the degeneracies become exact . by the 6x6x6 mesh ,",
    "the splittings are no longer apparent .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the convergence of the fractional error of the first few eigenvalues with increasing numbers of elements , at an arbitrary k - point . the variational nature and consistent , sextic convergence of the method",
    "are again clearly demonstrated .",

    "<S> we present an approach to solid - state electronic - structure calculations based on the finite - element method . in this method , </S>",
    "<S> the basis functions are strictly local , piecewise polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> because the basis is composed of polynomials , the method is completely general and its convergence can be controlled systematically . because the basis functions are strictly local in real space , the method allows for variable resolution in real space ; produces sparse , structured matrices , enabling the effective use of iterative solution methods ; and is well suited to parallel implementation . </S>",
    "<S> the method thus combines the significant advantages of both real - space - grid and basis - oriented approaches and so promises to be particularly well suited for large , accurate ab initio calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we develop the theory of our approach in detail , discuss advantages and disadvantages , and report initial results , including the first fully three - dimensional electronic band structures calculated by the method . </S>"
