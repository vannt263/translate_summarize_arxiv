    "in the mean - field description of a many - body system , the time - dependent wave function is assumed to be a slater determinant constructed with @xmath0 number of time - dependent single - particle wave functions @xmath1 .",
    "the single - particle wave - functions are determined by the time - dependent hartree - fock equations ( tdhf ) with proper initial conditions @xcite , @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the self - consistent mean - field hamiltonian . rather than the single - particle wave functions , in many situations ,",
    "it is more appropriate to express the mean - field approximation in terms of the single - particle density matrix @xmath4 , which is defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes occupation factors of the single - particle states . in standard tdhf",
    ", there are @xmath0 number of occupied states for which the occupation factors are one , @xmath7 , and zero for unoccupied states .",
    "if the initial state is at a finite temperature @xmath8 , occupation factors are determined by the fermi - dirac distribution , @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "the single - particle density matrix in the mean - field approximation evolves according to the transport equation , @xmath10\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the expectation value @xmath11 of a one - body observable @xmath12 and its dispersion @xmath13 are calculated according to , @xmath14 and @xmath15 the mean - field approximation includes , so called , the one - body dissipation mechanism and therefore it provides a good approximation for the average evolution of the collective motion at sufficiently low energies around @xmath16 per nucleon , at which two - body dissipation and fluctuation mechanism do not have an important influence on dynamics . in the mean - field approximation , while the single - particle motion is treated in the quantal framework , the collective motion is treated nearly in the classical approximation .",
    "therefore , the tdhf provides a good description of the average evolution of collective motion , however it severely restricts the fluctuations of the collective motion .",
    "much effort has been given to improve the mean - field description by incorporating two - body dissipation and fluctuation mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the resultant stochastic transport theory provides a suitable framework for dissipation and fluctuation dynamics of nuclear collisions at intermediate energies .",
    "however , the two - body dissipation and fluctuation mechanism does not play an important role at low energies .",
    "fundamental question is that how to improve the mean - field dynamics by incorporating one - body fluctuation mechanism ( i.e , mean - field fluctuations ) associated with the one - body dissipation in a microscopic level ? in this work , we address this question .",
    "we restrict our treatment at low energies at which mean - field evolution and the one - body dissipation mechanism provide a good approximation and propose a simple stochastic mean - field approach for describing fluctuation dynamics . in section 2",
    ", we give a brief description of the stochastic approach . in section 3 , we illustrate that the stochastic approach gives rise to the result , which is identical a previous formula derive using a variational approach . in section 4 , by projecting stochastic mean - field evolution on a collective path , we derive a generalized langevin equation for the collective variable .",
    "conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "in the mean - field framework only source for stochasticity can arise from the initial correlations . in the standard approach",
    ", the tdhf eq.(3 ) provides a deterministic evolution for the single - particle density matrix , starting from a well defined initial state . on the other hand , as a result of the correlations , the initial state can not have a well - defined single determinantal form , but rather it must be a superposition of determinantal wave functions . in the mean - field approximation , even though correlations are not propagated , initial correlations can be incorporated by considering , not a single initial state but a distribution of initial slater determinants .",
    "it is well - known that , such initial correlations can be simulated in a stochastic description @xcite . in order to develop a stochastic description ,",
    "we need to determine sufficient number of unoccupied single - particle states in addition to the occupied ones , and write the single - particle density matrix in the form , @xmath17 here @xmath18 are the time - independent elements of density matrix which is determined by the initial conditions .",

    "in the proposed stochastic approach , employing eq.(9 ) with random initial conditions , we generate an ensemble of different events .",
    "each event evolves according to its own self - consistent mean - field potential . in this approach , not only the mean value of an observable represented by a one - body operator @xmath12 , but we can calculate the probability distribution of the observable . the expectation value of an observable @xmath12 in an event is determined as , @xmath27 we note that the influence of the initial fluctuations appears in both the elements of the density matrix and also matrix elements of the observable . even if the magnitude of the initial fluctuations is small , the mean - field evolution can enhance the fluctuations , and hence events can substantially deviate from one another .",

    "this result is identical with the formula derived in a previous work employing variational approach @xcite .",
    "in order to illustrate the fact that the stochastic tdhf equation describes dynamics of fluctuations in accordance with the one - body dissipation mechanism , we give another example in this section .",
    "we consider that the collective motion is slow and maybe describe by a few relevant collective variables .",
    "for example , in induced fission dynamics relevant collective variables maybe taken as the relative distance of fragments , mass - asymmetry and neck parameter . here , we consider a single collective variable @xmath52 , and introduce the quasi - static single - particle representation , @xmath53 where @xmath54 $ ] denotes the mean - field hamiltonian , in which the time dependence of the local density @xmath55 is parameterized in terms of the collective variable in a suitable manner .",
    "we expand the single - particle density in terms of the quasi - particle representation , @xmath56 both the elements of density matrix @xmath57 and collective variable @xmath52 are fluctuating quantities . in this section for clarity of notation , we ignore the event label @xmath21 on these quantities .",
    "we determine the matrix elements of density in the lowest order perturbation theory in dynamical coupling @xmath58 .",
    "it is preferable that the wave functions are close to diabatic structure . since in the diabatic representation",
    ", dynamical coupling is expected to be small , hence , it can be treated in the weak - coupling approximation .",
    "diabatic single - particle representation can approximately be constructed by ignoring small symmetry breaking terms in the mean - field potential @xcite .    in order to determine the temporal evolution of collective variable",
    ", we use the total energy conservation , @xmath59 in the many - body hamiltonian , for simplicity we take an effective two - body interaction potential energy @xmath60 .",
    "the total energy depends on time implicitly via collective variable @xmath52 and explicitly via matrix elements @xmath61 .",
    "energy conservation requires , @xmath62 in this expression @xmath63 represents a dynamical force acting on the collective variable .",
    "the force depends on time , and it evolves from an initial diabatic form accompanied with deformation of fermi surface towards an adiabatic limit associated with the adiabatic potential energy .",
    "the second term represents the rate of change of the energy due to explicit time dependence , @xmath64 here , @xmath65 represents the occupation factors of the quasi - static single - particle states .",
    "it is possible to derive a master equation for the occupation factors by substituting the expansion ( 25 ) into eq.(9 ) to give @xmath66\\dot{q}(t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 .",

    "therefore , it determines not only the mean value of the occupation factors , but also their distribution functions .",
    "the first term on the right hand side is the one - body collision term determined by the dynamical coupling , while the last term represents its stochastic part .",
    "the stochasticity arises from the initial correlations @xmath72 , as described in section 2 . as a result ,",
    "the stochastic part of the collision term has a gaussian distribution with zero mean and a variance specified in terms of the variance of the initial matrix elements according to eq .",
    "( 7 ) .    using the master equation for the occupation factors ,",
    "the rate of change of total energy due to explicit time dependence can be expressed as , @xmath73(\\rho_k-\\rho_j)- \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\sum_{jk}[g_{jk}(t , t_0 ) \\epsilon_{kj}<\\psi_k|\\partial \\psi_j/\\partial q>_{t } \\dot { q}(t)\\rho_{jk}(t_0)+c.c.].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the magnitude of the coupling matrix elements , @xmath74 , should decrease as a function of energy difference , mainly as a result of the mismatch of overlap of wave functions .",
    "the energy dependence of the average behavior of square of coupling matrix element may be described by a gaussian or lorentzian form factor . in weak - coupling limit ,",
    "that we consider here , decay time of the memory kernel is determined by the correlation time of the coupling matrix elements defined as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the energy range of the form factor of the coupling matrix elements . during time interval smaller than the correlation time , @xmath77",
    ", we neglect the variation of single - particle energies as a function of collective variable and approximate the mean - field propagator by @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , for slow collective motion it is possible to carry out an expansion in powers of @xmath79 , as it was done in the linear response treatment of ref.@xcite . here , we do not carry out such an expansion , but consider the collective motion in a parabolic potential well . in this case",
    ", the memory effect can be taken approximately into account by incorporating harmonic propagation of collective motion during short time intervals according to , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the curvature of the harmonic well . incorporating the result into eq.(32 ) , and factoring out @xmath82 from each term , we deduce a generalized langevin equation of motion for the collective variable @xcite , @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 denotes the inertia , the friction coefficient and the stochastic force , respectively .",

    "a similar treatment can be carried out for a harmonic potential barrier @xcite . in obtaining the expressions for the inertia and the friction coefficient",
    ", we let the upper limit of time integration in eq.(32 ) go to infinity , @xmath91 .",
    "we notice that the principle part of the integration determines the inertia and real transitions described by the delta - function part of the propagator determines the friction coefficient .",
    "we note that the inertial force term in eq.(34 ) for the collective variable arises from the @xmath92 dependence on the coupling matrix element in eq.(32 ) .",
    "this dependence is included by expanding @xmath93 around @xmath52 in the lowest order in @xmath94 and using harmonic propagation for @xmath92 according to eq.(33 ) . also , a contribution to friction arises from this term , which vanishes at zero frequency limit . here",
    ", we ignore this contribution to the friction .",
    "the expression of the inertia is different from the adiabatic mass formula , which is known as cranking formula @xcite . due to factor @xmath95 in nominator , unlike the adiabatic mass formula",
    ", large contributions to inertia near quasi - crossings vanishes , and hence rapid variations of the adiabatic inertia in the vicinity of quasi - crossing of levels do not show up in the expression ( 35 ) .    as a result of stochastic properties of the initial correlations ,",
    "stochastic force has a gaussian distribution with zero mean @xmath96 and a second moment determined by the autocorrelation function , @xmath97.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we introduce the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the stochastic force . after a straightforward manipulation , it is easy to show that the autocorrelation function is related to frequency spectrum of the friction coefficient according to @xmath98 where @xmath99 is given by eq.(36 ) in which the collective frequency @xmath81 is replaced by the running frequency @xmath100 .",
    "this result represents the quantum fluctuation - dissipation relation associated with the one - body dissipation mechanism and it naturally emerges from the stochastic approach presented in this work @xcite . in the expression of the friction coefficient",
    "involves a form factor arising from energy dependence of the matrix elements .",
    "as discussed above , the form factor can be taken as a gaussian or lorentzian specified by the correlation energy range @xmath76 .",
    "the correlation energy acts as a cut - off for the integral over the frequency in eq.(39 ) . at high temperature limit , @xmath101 , since @xmath102 , the expression ( 39 ) reduces the classical result , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the zero frequency limit of the friction coefficient . in the zero temperature limit , on the other hand , @xmath105 , and the autocorrelation function , @xmath106 purely associated with quantum zero point fluctuations .",
    "in this work , we propose a microscopic stochastic approach to improve description of nuclear dynamics beyond the mean - field approximation at low energies . in order to demonstrate scientific validity of the approach , we present two illustrations . in the first case ,",
    "we show that , for small amplitude fluctuations , the proposed stochastic model gives a result for the dispersion of a one - body observable that is identical to previous result obtained through a variational approach . in the second case , by projecting the stochastic mean - field evolution on a collective path , we derive a generalized langevin equation for collective variable , which incorporate one - body dissipation and one - body fluctuation mechanism in accordance with quantal fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "we believe that such illustrations provide a strong support that the proposed model provides a consistent microscopic description for dynamics of density fluctuations in nuclear collisions at low energies .",
    "in fact , such a stochastic approach provides a useful tool not only for nuclear dynamics but also other fields , such electron dynamics in atomic and condense matter physics .",
