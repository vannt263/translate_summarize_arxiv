    "one complication for rates studies is that many sn surveys at low redshifts are galaxy - targeted , counting discoveries in a select sample of galaxies and converting to a volumetric rate by assuming a galaxy luminosity function .",
    "this method can be susceptible to systematic errors if it preferentially samples the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function , biasing toward sne in more massive , or brighter , galaxies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since many sn ia properties are correlated with their hosts , the recovered rates may then not be representative of all types of sne  ia .",
    "a second type of sn survey involves making repeat observations of pre - defined fields in a `` rolling search '' , to find and follow sne in specific volumes of sky over a period of time .",
    "such surveys minimize the influence of host bias , but still suffer from malmquist bias and other selection effects .",
    "it is reasonably straight forward  although often computationally expensive  to compensate for the observational biases within rolling searches .",
    "the advent of these wide - field rolling surveys has significantly enhanced sn statistics at cosmological distances .",
    "the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) in particular has contributed a large sample of type ia sne out to redshifts of @xmath16 @xcite .",

    "brighter , more slowly - declining ( i.e. , higher stretch ) sne  ia are more frequently found in star - forming spirals , whereas fainter , faster - declining sne  ia tend to occur in older stellar populations with little or no star formation @xcite .",

    "the first is that the snls , and by extension all other  studies , are missing a significant number of sne ia , a factor of at least four .",
    "however , it is difficult to understand how this might occur , given some of the cluster rates used in @xcite are drawn from very similar surveys ( including snls and sdss - sn ) .",
    "a second possibility is that the cosmic sfh models used in our analysis over - predict the actual sfr  a lower sfh normalization would require a higher dtd normalization to match the volumetric rate data . to test this possibility , we repeat our rates fitting analysis using the sfh of @xcite , a sfh derived from a requirement to match the redshift evolution of .",

    "other options to adjust the sfh normalization downward , such as reducing the dust extinction corrections applied to the various star - formation indicators which make up the sfh compilations , are probably not viable given the long - established and significant evidence for obscuration in star - forming galaxies , and the agreement between the different diagnostics ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a third possibility is that the cluster rates used to derive the dtd of @xcite have some contamination from `` younger '' sne ia , thus increasing their rates above that appropriate for their age , assuming a redshift of formation of 3 .",
    "this , and other similar potential systematics from the clusters analysis , are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "finally , it may well be the case that the assumption of a single dtd is not adequate , given the various indications that there may be more than one progenitor channel .",
    "this would suggest that there is not one universal dtd that is independent of redshift , or other variables , such as metallicity .",
    "there is an observed correlation between the photometric properties of sne  ia and their host environments @xcite .",

    "the snls rates increase with redshift as ( 1+@xmath4)@xmath5 with @xmath6 , and show no evidence of flattening beyond @xmath111 . due to spectroscopic incompleteness and the decrease in detection efficiency for the snls sample , a rollover in the slope can not be ruled out beyond @xmath186 based on the snls data alone .    as a significant component of the sn  ia rate",
    "is linked with young stellar populations , an increasing fraction of sn  ia events may suffer the effects of host extinction at higher redshifts . in our rate calculation method ,",
    "the effect of sn color is factored directly into the detection efficiency determinations : detection recovery is evaluated empirically according to the observed sn color regardless of its cause .",
    "redder objects at a given redshift have lower detection efficiencies , and are correspondingly more heavily weighted in the rates determination .    combining the snls data with that from other sn ia surveys , we fit various simple delay - time distributions ( dtds ) to the volumetric sn ia rate data .",
    "dtds with a single gaussian are not favored by the data .",
    "we find that simple power - law dtds ( @xmath300 ) with @xmath301 ( @xmath8 to @xmath9 depending on the parameterization of the cosmic sfh ) can adequately explain all the sn ia volumetric rate data , as can two - component models with a prompt and delayed channel .",
    "these models can not be separated with the current volumetric rate data . integrating these different",
    "dtds gives the total number of sne ia per solar mass formed ( excluding sub - luminous @xmath357 events ) of @xmath382 ( assuming a salpeter imf ) , depending on the star formation history and dtd model .",
    "this is in good agreement with other similar analyses , but lies significantly below the number expected from dtds derived from cluster sn ia rates .",
    "the use of other techniques , such as fitting the sfh of individual galaxies @xcite , or observing a simplified subset of galaxies @xcite , use more information , and in principle ought to be more reliable .",
    "however , each technique has significant drawbacks , such as contamination @xcite , limitations of sed fitting codes @xcite , and the assumption that all cluster galaxies formed at @xmath383 in a delta - function of star - formation @xcite .",
    "therefore , our results are an important complementary constraint . by presenting an evolution in the sn ia rate over a large redshift baseline done self - consistently by a single survey we have for the first time mitigated the primary drawback of this method  having to combine myriad rate determinations from multiple surveys ,",
    "all done with different assumptions and biases , sometimes disparate by large factors @xcite .",
    "we also find no clear evidence for a difference in the rate evolution for snls samples with @xmath13 and @xmath384 out to @xmath361 , although the stretch evolution model from @xcite can not be ruled out conclusively .",
    "stretch evolution plays a more significant role in the sub - luminous population @xcite , which show a much flatter evolution than the @xmath364 sample .",
    "next generation surveys such as dark energy survey ( des ) , pan - starrs , palomar transient factory ( ptf ) , and skymapper , many of which are already underway , are finding thousands of sne ia ( in comparison to the @xmath33 in this study ) .",
    "statistical rate determinations ought to improve , but systematic difficulties will remain , as not all sne can be spectroscopically confirmed . however , large number statistics will allow the construction of sub - samples larger than the three ( split by stretch ) analyzed here . comparison of the relative rates of sne with different properties and in different environments may ultimately improve deduced dtds , and allow for the construction of different dtds for subsets of sne ia .",

    "<S> we present a measurement of the volumetric type ia supernova ( sn  ia ) rate ( ) as a function of redshift for the first four years of data from the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) supernova legacy survey ( snls ) . </S>",

    "<S> the volumetric  evolution is consistent with a rise to @xmath3 that follows a power - law of the form ( 1+@xmath4)@xmath5 , with @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this evolutionary trend in the snls rates is slightly shallower than that of the cosmic star - formation history over the same redshift range . </S>",
    "<S> we combine the snls rate measurements with those from other surveys that complement the snls redshift range , and fit various simple sn ia delay - time distribution ( dtd ) models to the combined data . a simple power - law model for the dtd ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) yields values from @xmath8 to @xmath9 depending on the parameterization of the cosmic star formation history . </S>",
    "<S> a two - component model , where  is dependent on stellar mass ( ) and star formation rate ( sfr ) as @xmath10 , yields the coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> more general two - component models also fit the data well , but single gaussian or exponential dtds provide significantly poorer matches . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we split the snls sample into two populations by the light curve width ( stretch ) , and show that the general behavior in the rates of faster - declining sne  ia ( @xmath13 ) is similar , within our measurement errors , to that of the slower objects ( @xmath14 ) out to @xmath15 . </S>"
