    "the experimental endeavor in the past decades has established that the phenomenon of neutrino flavor transitions is described by neutrino oscillations at leading order .",
    "now that the smallest leptonic mixing angle @xmath7 has been measured very accurately at reactor  @xcite and accelerator  @xcite neutrino experiments , one of the next major and open problems is the discrimination between normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies . towards this challenge , different types of experiments have been suggested using long - baseline accelerator - based neutrinos , atmospheric neutrinos , supernova neutrinos , or reactor neutrinos .",
    "recent studies indicate that a dedicated medium - baseline reactor antineutrino experiment with sufficient statistics and unprecedented detector performance provides an opportunity to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and probe with high precision the other neutrino parameters ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in the near future ,",
    "potential projects along this direction include the juno  @xcite and reno-50  @xcite experiments .    beyond the standard oscillation picture",
    ", new physics may appear in future neutrino experiments in the form of unknown couplings involving neutrinos , which are usually referred to as nonstandard neutrino interactions  @xcite ( nsis ) .",
    "in fact , nsis are predicted as dimension - six and higher - order operators in many interesting extensions of the standard model , e.g. , @xmath8-parity violating supersymmetric theories , left - right symmetric models , grand unification theories , extra dimensions , and various seesaw models ( see , e.g. , the recent review on nsis  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "basically , all modern extensions could give rise to nsis , and the investigation of nsis could be very helpful in revealing additional new physics behind neutrino flavor transitions .",
    "in addition , it plays an important complementary role to direct searches of new physics at colliders .",
    "nsi effects at reactor antineutrino experiments have been studied with emphasis on mimicking effects  @xcite , the discrepancy between source and detector nsis  @xcite , comparisons between reactor and accelerator experiments  @xcite , and modifications of event rates and the impact on the measurements of standard oscillation parameters  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the model - independent bounds on production and detection nsis have been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , and all bounds are basically of order @xmath9 .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate nsi effects at a typical medium - baseline reactor antineutrino experiment , in particular , the mimicking effects in the precision measurements of neutrino parameters , the discovery reach of nsi effects , and the distortion of the neutrino mass hierarchy determination .",
    "specifically , we concentrate on an experimental setup similar to the juno experiment and show that , for five years of running , a clear hint for nonstandard neutrino physics can be provided .",
    "the remainder of this letter is organized as follows . in section  [ sec",
    ": formalism ] , we present the general formalism and derive relevant antineutrino survival probability formulas used in the subsequent analysis .",
    "illustrations of nsi effects on the corresponding oscillation probabilities and energy distributions of neutrino events are also given . in section  [ sec : numerics ] , a detailed numerical analysis of the observability of the nsi effects at juno is performed .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : summary ] , we summarize and state our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we present the general formulas for reactor antineutrino oscillations with nsis . for a realistic experiment , nsis may appear both in the production and detection processes , and the neutrino states produced in the source and observed at the detector can be treated as superpositions of pure orthonormal flavor states : @xmath10 where the superscripts ` s ' and ` d ' denote the source and the detector , respectively , with the normalization factors @xmath11_{\\alpha\\alpha } } \\;~~ , \\\\ n^{\\rm d}_\\beta & = & \\sqrt{\\left[\\left(\\mathbbold{1 } + \\varepsilon^{{\\rm d } \\dagger } \\right)\\left(\\mathbbold{1 } + { \\varepsilon^{\\rm d } } \\right ) \\right]_{\\beta \\beta } }    \\;~~ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in general , the nsi parameter matrices @xmath12 and @xmath13 are arbitrary and nonunitary , indicating that neither @xmath14 nor @xmath15 are orthonormal states . as first observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , heavy neutrino states responsible for neutrino mass generation decouple from oscillation processes , so that the unitarity of the leptonic mixing matrix is slightly violated .",
    "the nonunitary effects , which could be significant in low - scale seesaw models  @xcite , can be regarded as one type of nsis with the requirement @xmath16 @xcite . for reactor antineutrinos ,",
    "the leading - order nsis are of the @xmath17 type as long as cpt is conserved , and it is very common to assume @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "thus , we will take @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 being the modulus of @xmath21 ) in the current consideration and neglect the superscripts ` s ' and ` d ' throughout the following parts of this work .",
    "furthermore , the typical energy of antineutrinos produced in nuclear reactors is around a few mev , which indicates that earth matter effects are very small and can safely be neglected in most situations .",
    "hence , the propagation of neutrino flavor states is governed by the vacuum hamiltonian @xmath22 where the leptonic mixing matrix @xmath23 is usually parametrized in the standard form by using three mixing angles and one cp - violating phase @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( for @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "including the nsi effects , we arrive at the amplitude for the @xmath30 oscillation channel @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the propagation distance and the explicit form of @xmath33 is a coherent sum over the contributions of all mass eigenstates @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35 . inserting @xmath36 into eq .",
    ", one can rewrite the amplitude in a compact form @xmath37 with @xmath38}{1 + 2 \\varepsilon_{ee } \\cos \\phi_{ee } + \\varepsilon^2_{ee } + \\varepsilon^2_{e\\mu } + \\varepsilon^2_{e\\tau } } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & |u_{ei}|^2 +   2 \\sum_{\\alpha \\neq e } { \\rm re } \\left(u^*_{\\alpha i } u_{e i } \\varepsilon_{e\\alpha } { \\rm e}^{{\\rm i } \\phi_{e\\alpha}}\\right ) + { \\cal o}(\\varepsilon^2 ) \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is a general feature from the first row of eq .",
    "( [ eq : j ] ) that @xmath39 is real for the survival probabilities , which is actually a reflection of cpt conservation .",
    "therefore , the amplitudes are identical for neutrino and antineutrino oscillations .",
    "however , this is no longer true when matter effects are non - negligible , since the ordinary earth environment is cp asymmetric  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the limit @xmath40 , we have @xmath41 , and hence , eq .   is reduced to the standard oscillation amplitude .    in practice , it is more useful to express the @xmath39 parameters in terms of the leptonic mixing parameters , i.e. , @xmath42 where the auxiliary parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 are defined as @xmath45 one observes that the @xmath46-dependent terms disappear from the survival probability , as a consequence of our chosen normalization .",
    "moreover , if all cp - violating phases are vanishing , the auxiliary nsi parameters @xmath47 are related to the original ones @xmath48 by a rotation with the angle @xmath49 .",
    "now , it is straightforward to derive the survival probability for electron antineutrinos @xmath50 where @xmath51 for normal neutrino mass hierarchy ( nh ) and @xmath52 for inverted neutrino mass hierarchy ( ih ) . here and henceforth , the hat in the antineutrino state @xmath53 will be omitted , hopefully without causing any confusion .",
    "then , considering a medium - baseline neutrino experiment , such as juno or reno-50 , we find that eq .",
    "approximates to @xmath54 \\sin^2 \\frac{\\delta m^2_{21 } l}{4e } \\nonumber \\\\ & & - 4 s_{13 } c_{13 } \\left(s_{13 } c_{13 } c^2_{12 } - \\sin 2\\theta_{12 } s_{13 } \\varepsilon_\\phi + 2 c^2_{12 } \\cos 2\\theta_{13 } \\varepsilon_\\delta \\right ) \\sin^2",

    "where the higher - order terms @xmath55 have been neglected .",
    "note that eq .   reproduces the standard survival probability in the limit @xmath43 , @xmath56 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be vanishingly small if , e.g. , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in this case",
    ", only the higher - order terms @xmath55 appear in the survival probability .",
    "in addition , the difference between the oscillation probability in the nh case and that in the ih case , i.e. , @xmath59 , can be written as @xmath60 indicating the impact of the nsi parameters on the discrimination between nh and ih .",
    "the survival probability @xmath61 as a function of the neutrino energy for reactor experiments with baseline length @xmath62 in the nh case .",
    "the solid ( black ) curve corresponds to the standard oscillation ( sd ) , while the dashed ( red ) curve denotes the nsi polluted oscillation probability calculated by assuming only one nonzero nsi parameter @xmath63 . in addition , the standard mixing parameters @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath58 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 have been used . ,",
    "scaledwidth=80.0% ]    for illustration , we show the survival probability @xmath61 with and without nsis in fig .",
    "[ fig : pee ] .",
    "the nsi polluted survival probability deviates from the standard one especially at energies around 3  mev . for @xmath63 ,",
    "the minimum of the probability is slightly larger than in the standard case , indicating that the measured value of @xmath69 should be smaller than its true value .",
    "such a feature can be understood from the oscillation probability in eq .   that a negative @xmath43 is expected for @xmath70 and @xmath71 , reducing the amplitude of the @xmath72-driven oscillation .",
    "consequently , one requires a smaller @xmath69 compared to the true input parameter in order to reduce the effective amplitude so as to gain a better fit . on the other hand ,",
    "a positive @xmath73 enhances the amplitudes of the @xmath74 and @xmath75-driven oscillation modes , suggesting that a larger @xmath7 can be extracted from the experimental data .",
    "these observations are also confirmed later by our numerical analysis in section  [ sub : nsifit ] .",
    "if @xmath76 is assumed instead , the nsi - polluted survival probability becomes smaller than the standard one around the oscillation maximum associated with @xmath72 , which can be understood from the opposite signs in front of @xmath4 and @xmath5 in eq .  .",
    "in an analogous way , one arrives at the conclusion that a larger value of @xmath77 or @xmath78 than its true value is expected from the fit to experimental data .",
    "however , at the probability level , there will be no visible differences between the nh and ih cases , which applies to the case with either @xmath76 or @xmath70 .",
    "finally , we remark that the oscillation frequencies are not affected by the nsis , which can be observed from eq .  .",
    "therefore , the nsis affect the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy at a medium - baseline reactor experiment by modifying the oscillation amplitudes instead of the oscillation frequencies .",
    "we proceed to perform a numerical analysis of nsi effects on the measurements of neutrino parameters . to this end",
    ", we employ the globes software  @xcite and consider the configuration of the juno experiment described in detail in ref .",
    "explicitly , we take the reactor thermal power to be @xmath79 and the baseline length @xmath62 . the detector mass is assumed to be 20  kt together with the energy resolution @xmath80 as a benchmark , where the energy is given in units of mev . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , such an experimental setup allows one to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy at a confidence level of 4@xmath81 for a six - year running ( with 300 effective days per year ) .",
    "we further make use of a single overall factor @xmath82 together with the error @xmath83 to parametrize the uncertainties of the total reactor antineutrino flux , the cross section of inverse beta decay , the fiducial mass , and the weight fraction of free protons .    the original abstract experiment definition language ( aedl ) file for reactor antineutrino experiments in globes @xcite",
    "is modified for our purpose .",
    "the parametrization of reactor antineutrino flux is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the same fuel composition as in ref .",
    "@xcite is assumed , and the cross section for the inverse beta decay @xmath84 from ref .",
    "@xcite is adopted .",
    "the neutrino events are simulated by using the following true values for the oscillation parameters @xmath85 together with the nsi parameters . the running time is taken to be five years , equivalent to the juno setup in ref .",
    "the total number of non - oscillated neutrino events is around @xmath86 , and that of the oscillated ones is about @xmath87 for the central values of standard mixing parameters in eq .  .",
    "note that no backgrounds are assumed in our simulations .",
    "the simulated data are then processed using the standard @xmath88 analysis through the following @xmath88 function @xmath89 ^ 2}{n_i ( p^{\\rm true},\\varepsilon^{\\rm true } ) } + { \\rm priors } \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 denotes the number of events in the @xmath91-th energy bin , the parameter vector @xmath92 contains the standard oscillation parameters and the systematical errors , and @xmath93 represents the nsi parameters . in the fit , all the standard oscillation parameters for the @xmath94 channel are marginalized over , but the nsi parameters are fixed to zero . the reason is that we are interested in how the standard oscillation fit is modified when there are nsis involved .",
    "the prior terms implement external input from other experiments and have the form @xmath95 with @xmath96 being the corresponding externally given uncertainty .",
    "first , in fig .  [ fig : dnde ] ,",
    "we show the expected energy distribution of antineutrino events for the juno setup . in each plot",
    ", the thick ( black ) curves stand for the distributions for the standard case , whereas the thin ( red ) curves correspond to the distributions when the nsi effects are included .",
    "independently of the neutrino mass hierarchy , one can see a clear distinction between the black ( thick ) and red ( thin ) curves .",
    "however , such a spectrum shift can be absorbed into the mixing angle @xmath69 , which does not lead to significant contributions to the @xmath88 function but may change the fitted value of @xmath97 dramatically .",
    "when @xmath98 is positive , the event rate decreases compared to the standard case , implying that the extracted value of @xmath69 is slightly larger than its true value .",
    "similarly , a nonvanishing @xmath99 would result in a smaller fitted value for @xmath69 . in both cases ,",
    "the amplitude of high - frequency oscillations is enhanced , so the a larger fitted value of @xmath78 is expected .",
    "these observations are in accordance with our discussions on the survival probability in section  [ sec : formalism ] , and in agreement with our numerical fit in the following subsection .",
    "the impact of nsis on the event rates and measurements of standard oscillation parameters has also been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a different experimental setup was considered .",
    "second , in order to examine the nsi - induced offsets in the standard oscillation fit , we use the true parameters from eq .   together with a non - vanishing nsi parameter to generate the neutrino events .",
    "then , in the fit , all the standard oscillation parameters are marginalized over , while the nsi parameters are fixed to zero . assuming two degrees of freedom , we show the effects of nsis in the fit in figs .",
    "[ fig : theta_mass1 ] and [ fig : theta_mass2 ] for nh and some benchmark nsi parameters .    using fig .",
    "[ fig : theta_mass1 ] , one finds that the deviation of the best - fit @xmath97 from its true value is remarkable . even for a relatively small values of the nsi parameters ,",
    "the true @xmath69 may be ruled out erroneously .",
    "consistent with our analytical studies in the previous section , a positive @xmath98 leads to a fake @xmath69 larger than its true value , whereas a positive @xmath99 signifies a positive @xmath100 , and hence , a smaller fitted @xmath69 is favored .    as for @xmath7 ,",
    "one observes from fig .",
    "[ fig : theta_mass2 ] that the best - fit value only mildly deviates from its true value , which can be viewed as a result of the moderate sensitivity for the juno experiment to @xmath7 .",
    "the result for @xmath101 is quite similar to that for @xmath102 in the left panel . for comparison",
    ", we show in the right panel that the best - fit value of @xmath78 becomes smaller than the true value if @xmath103 . as mentioned before ,",
    "the determination of the neutrino mass - squared differences are essentially not spoiled by nsi effects , and both @xmath72 and @xmath74 can be fixed at a very - high confidence level as shown in the plots .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the precisions of @xmath72 and @xmath74 are slightly better for larger values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , as observed from figs .",

    "in which the maximal values of @xmath108 and @xmath109 are reached for @xmath110 or @xmath111 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a nonzero value of the dirac cp - violating phase @xmath112 results in only a global shift of the contour lines in fig .",

    ", the input value of @xmath112 changes the sensitivity dramatically . as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : eps - eps ] , a maximal cp - violating phase @xmath117 leads to a vanishing value of @xmath44 and a suppressed value of @xmath43 due to the approximate @xmath118-@xmath119 symmetry .",

    ", a @xmath3 hint can be obtained if both @xmath4 and @xmath5 are larger than 0.02 .",
    "we remark that the discovery reach on nsis depends strongly on the assumed uncertainty of @xmath7 . in our numerical analysis , a relatively optimistic uncertainty on @xmath7",
    "is assumed , which actually relies on the precision of the measurement of @xmath7 in ongoing and future non - reactor experiments ( e.g. , the long - baseline accelerator experiments t2k and no@xmath120a ) . in general , nsis induce conflicts between measurement obtained in different type of experiments , and therefore , a combined analysis of both short- , medium - baseline reactor experiments , and accelerator experiments will be more powerful in constraining the nsi parameters .",
    "however , such an analysis is beyond the scope of this work and will be performed elsewhere .",
    "note that we have concentrated on nsis in the production and detection of reactor antineutrinos , and ignored nsis in the propagation , which could also be important for solar  @xcite , atmospheric  @xcite , and long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite .",

    "then perform a standard oscillation fit with either nh or ih .",
    "the dependence of the minimal @xmath88 on the nsi parameters is shown in fig .",

    ", a positive @xmath98 or @xmath99 leads to a larger @xmath88 in the wrong hierarchy fit .",
    "the deterioration effects in the neutrino mass hierarchy fit are mainly due to the mimicking effects on @xmath7 .",

    ", a @xmath3 hint for nsi effects can be obtained when both @xmath4 and @xmath5 are larger than 0.02 .",
