    "there has been much recent interest in the nernst effect in the context of high-@xmath8 superconductivity , since underdoped cuprates were found to have an unusually large nernst coefficient in the normal state.@xcite this may be due to superconducting fluctuations above @xmath8 , or it may be purely a quasiparticle effect.@xcite the quasiparticle nernst effect has been studied on the basis of the linearized boltzmann equation in the relaxation - time approximation.@xcite this is a reliable approach if the scattering rate is isotropic , since then the neglected `` scattering - in '' contributions average out to zero .",
    "there is , however , considerable experimental evidence for predominantly small - angle elastic scattering in the cuprates,@xcite possibly due to long - range potential fluctuations from dopant atoms in between the @xmath9 planes.@xcite    it is not surprising that existing studies rely on the relaxation - time approximation , since the full solution of the boltzmann equation with both band and scattering anisotropies is a notoriously difficult problem.@xcite in our literature search we have found magneto - electric calculations that go beyond the relaxation - time approximation,@xcite but no magneto - thermo - electric studies .",
