    "the temperature dependence of the london penetration depth @xmath0 plays an important role in the ongoing debate about the mechanism of high @xmath1 superconductivity .",
    "it is indeed an essential piece of information about this mechanism to know the symmetry of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "while an s - wave type order parameter ( that is having a fixed sign over the fermi surface ) finds a natural explanation in terms of a purely attractive interaction , an order parameter which changes sign over the fermi surface , such as the d - wave one produced by the spin fluctuation mechanism , points toward some repulsive component in the pairing interaction .",
    "a change of sign for the order parameter implies the existence of nodes of the gap and hence of low energy elementary excitations in the superconducting phase .",
    "these should manifest themselves experimentally in numerous low temperature properties .",
    "however the interpretation of many experiments is not so easy . in this respect",
    "the penetration depth is a very interesting quantity to measure since it is a thermodynamic quantity and its measurement is less likely to be perturbed by extrinsic defects than a dynamical quantity .",
    "moreover it is a bulk quantity since one explores the sample over typically 1000 a , in contrast to photoemission or tunnelling where only a few atomic layers at the surface are involved , which raises the fear that the surface might be perturbed or perturbing in some way .",
    "the existence of low energy excitations should produce for @xmath2 a low temperature dependence stronger than the standard bcs behaviour , which is essentially flat .",
    "therefore many experimentalists have looked at this low t behaviour .",
    "in particular they have quite often tried to fit this behaviour with a power law @xmath3 since this would allow to find if the nodes of the gap , if any , are located on points or lines on the fermi surface .",
    "indeed many experiments on ybco and bissco @xcite have found near @xmath4 behaviours which have been interpreted as proving the existence of point nodes .",
    "more recently ybco cristals @xcite and films @xcite have shown a t behaviour , pointing toward lines of nodes at the fermi surface .",
    "there is however an implicit assumption in this kind of conclusion .",
    "this is that no s - wave superconductor can give a low temperature dependence compatible with experiment .",
    "this assumption has been mainly challenged by pointing out that strongly anisotropic s - wave superconductors will clearly give a low t behaviour stronger than standard bcs .",
    "a related point is that normal layers will also produce low energy excitations and a strong low t dependence @xcite .",
    "however even for a completely isotropic superconductor there is also another direction to look for possible physical effects which would spoil the standard interpretation . indeed , when comparison is made with experiment , the standard reference theory for s - wave superconductivity is the weak coupling bcs theory . on the other hand",
    "there are good indications that high @xmath1 superconductors might be in the strong coupling regime .",
    "indeed , in addition to the high value of @xmath1 itself , resistivity as well as infrared experiments give for the inverse quasiparticle lifetime at @xmath1 a value which is of order of @xmath1 itself , in clear contradiction with the weak coupling assumption which requires it to be much smaller than @xmath5 it is therefore worthwhile to wonder about strong coupling effects on the penetration depth at low temperature .",
    "although much work @xcitehas been devoted to the strong coupling theory of @xmath2 and qualitative suggestions have been made on strong coupling effects @xcite , there has been to our knowledge no quantitative and systematic study of the low temperature behaviour .",
    "this is naturally easy to understand since , before the discovery of high @xmath1 superconductivity and the recent debate on the symmetry , there was no specific reason to look in details at this specific point .",
    "it is our purpose in this paper to consider this theoretical question in detail , both as a basic exploration in strong coupling theory and as a reference for the interpretation of experiments in high @xmath1 compounds .",
    "we will consider only isotropic superconductors .",
    "our purpose is indeed to show that even in this case , the low temperature behaviour can be qualitatively different from the bcs result .",
    "naturally strong anisotropy will produce important additional changes at low temperature .",
    "we will come back on this point at the end of the paper . in the next section",
    "we give our procedure for this systematic exploration . in section",
    "iii we give our results and discuss their physical origin .",
    "finally we discuss in the last section the consequences of our findings .",
    "the fact that the penetration depth is a thermodynamic quantity is an important advantage for the study of strong coupling effects .",
    "indeed the input of any calculation in the strong coupling eliashberg theory is the so - called eliashberg function @xmath6 which gives the strength of the electron phonon interaction for a given phonon frequency @xmath7 ( naturally we might consider as well an attractive pairing interaction caused by the exchange of other kinds of bosons , but in the following we will consider phonons for simplicity ) . in principle",
    "the knowledge of @xmath6 is equivalent to fixing an infinite number of parameters . in practice",
    "this forces to consider a set of models for @xmath6 depending on a restricted number of parameters .",
    "these models are in general either inferred from experimental data or chosen for various theoretical reasons .",
    "nevertheless this procedure is not satisfactory since the chosen models contain necessarily some arbitrary ingredients : either these are irrelevant and it would be better to know it , or they are important in which case they are not under control .",
    "however it has been pointed out recently that it is possible to overcome this difficulty for thermodynamic quantities @xcite . indeed",
    "the very structured eliashberg function @xmath6 enters actually the imaginary axis eliashberg equations only through the very smooth spectral function @xmath8 = @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 which gives physically the frequency dependence of the effective pairing interaction .",
    "it has been shown @xcitethat it is possible in a systematic way to approximate very well ( within a few percent ) all the possible @xmath13 by a set of functions , depending on 5 parameters , which provide in this way a  representation  of all the possible spectra @xmath6 .",
    "for the critical temperature and the gap , it was indeed found that the difference between the quantity calculated from the original spectrum and from its representation differed at most by a few percent . although there are clearly many different ways to choose the functions which give the representation , we have found it convenient to use all the functions generated by a spectrum made of two einstein peaks @xcite . in this case the five parameters are , in addition to the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath14 the frequencies @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the two peaks and their weights @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath17 + @xmath18 = @xmath19 with @xmath19 being the total coupling strength .",
    "we set r = @xmath16 / @xmath15 and @xmath20 = @xmath18 / @xmath21 these parameters are obtained from the original spectrum @xcite by r = ( 1 + @xmath22 ) / ( 1 @xmath23 @xmath24 , where 1 + @xmath25 = @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath7 @xmath29 . and @xmath20 is the solution of @xmath30 ( 1 + @xmath31 ) / ( 1 + @xmath32 = @xmath33 @xmath34 , which is easily solved numerically . here",
    "@xmath36 = @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath35 @xmath37 and @xmath34 = lim @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 .",
    "we stress that the exploration of this representation will allow us to cover all the possible cases arising in strong coupling theory .    in the present case",
    "the situation simplifies somewhat since we will consider the variation of the reduced penetration depth @xmath2 / @xmath41 as a function of the reduced temperature t / @xmath5 therefore the absolute values of the frequencies will naturally be irrelevant and , in addition to @xmath14 we are left with only 3 parameters to vary , namely the total coupling strength @xmath42 the ratio r of the peak frequencies which is a measure of the width of the spectrum , and the relative weight p = @xmath18 / @xmath19 of the high frequency peak compared to the total coupling strength .",
    "actually we will consider only the case @xmath43 = 0 in this paper although we have also explored the case @xmath43 = 0.1 .",
    "the reason for this will be clear in the following . indeed the coulomb pseudopotential is a high frequency contribution to the pairing interaction while we will see that all the interesting physics comes from low frequencies , as we might expect at low temperature .",
    "therefore @xmath43 provides essentially an uninteresting renormalization of the coupling strength .",
    "our endeavour meets from the start with a basic problem , which is both conceptual and practical . whereas it is straightforward to give the variation of a physical quantity as a function of various parameters , how can we study the low temperature dependence of @xmath2 as a function of these parameters ?",
    "indeed we do not know of any general functional dependence of @xmath2 in this regime , which would then depend only on a few parameters .",
    "in fact this general problem is analogous to the one raised above for @xmath6 and the solution should be the same : we ought to expand @xmath2 on an appropriate functional basis and find the coefficients of this expansion .",
    "actually the present experimental situation and the way most results are analyzed suggest a natural way to do something of this kind .",
    "we will try to find an approximate power law dependence for @xmath2 at low temperature , which provides us with an exponent and a prefactor to characterize this behaviour .",
    "naturally we will find in general that @xmath2 does not obey a power law .",
    "therefore we will proceed specifically in the following way .",
    "we work with the superfluid density @xmath44 = @xmath45 / @xmath46 and define apparent exponents between temperature @xmath47 and @xmath48 as n = ln [ ( 1 - @xmath49 ) / ( 1 - @xmath50 ) ] / ln @xmath51 / @xmath47 ) . both for experimental and theoretical reasons we do not take our sampling temperature too low . indeed for the experiments we are interested in @xcite ,",
    "the low temperature behaviour is pretty flat with some scatter and the resulting imprecision makes results obtained in this region rather meaningless . on the theoretical side we could naturally go in this region , but the variations of @xmath52 would be minute .",
    "moreover we know theoretically that a power law will be a very bad description of @xmath2 in this regime .",
    "therefore we have chosen our sampling temperatures to cover the  middle - low  temperature region 0.2 @xmath26 t / @xmath1 @xmath26 0.5 where an experimentalist is most likely to look for a power law .",
    "precisely we have taken @xmath53 / @xmath1 = 0.2 , @xmath54 / @xmath1 = 0.35 and @xmath55 / @xmath1 = 0.5 , and we have defined three exponents : @xmath56 between 0.35 and 0.5 , @xmath57 between 0.2 and 0.5 , and @xmath58 between 0.2 and 0.35 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "naturally @xmath57 = 0.389 @xmath56 + 0.611 @xmath58 , but we find it convenient to use this redondant presentation because @xmath58 - @xmath56 appears as a kind of theoretical  error bar  for the middle exponent @xmath59 a large value will tell us that a power law is a bad representation of the temperature dependence of @xmath2 in this region , while a small error bar will mean that a simple power law provides a good description .",
    "most of the time we have found @xmath56 @xmath26 @xmath57 @xmath26 @xmath58 corresponding to a weaker t dependence at lower temperature , but it is important that the reverse order occurred also .",
    "naturally our description could be improved , for example by replacing the prefactor by a polynomial , but we have not explored this possibility .",
    "the london penetration depth is given by @xcite :    @xmath60    here @xmath61 is the weak coupling penetration depth at t = 0 in the clean limit , given by @xmath62 @xmath63 ( 2/d ) @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 where d is the dimensionality of the superconductor,@xmath64 the density of states per spin at the fermi level , @xmath67 is the impurity scattering time , and @xmath68 and @xmath69 are respectively the gap function and the phonon renormalization function at the matsubara frequencies @xmath70 = @xmath71 these last ones are given by the solution of the eliashberg equations :    @xmath72    where :    @xmath73    with @xmath19 @xmath63 @xmath74 as above the brackets @xmath75 are for the average @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath76 ... over phonons frequency with respect to the normalized eliashberg function @xmath76 = @xmath37 .",
    "although this imaginary axis expression eq.(1 ) is by far the most convenient for numerical calculations , it is useful for the physical interpretation of the results to write also the corresponding expression with integration on the real frequency axis .",
    "indeed this allows to express the penetration depth , which gives the superfluid response to the electromagnetic field , in terms of virtual pair - breaking excitations .",
    "this expression reads :    @xmath77    it reduces to eq.(1 ) by deforming the integration contour toward the imaginary frequency axis .",
    "this result is easy to understand physically .",
    "if one omits the last term in the integral , this expression is the standard bcs result except for the frequency dependence of @xmath78 the last term corresponds to the mass renormalization of the excitations . indeed in addition to the constant factor @xmath79 due to the band structure effective mass coming in the prefactor @xmath62 , one has to include the frequency dependent mass renormalization function @xmath80 naturally the imaginary part of @xmath81 will describe the effect of the finite lifetime of the excitations .",
    "the additional contribution @xmath82 @xmath83 - @xmath84 in the last term is just the corresponding effect of impurities on the excitation lifetime . in this paper",
    "we will actually be concerned only with the clean limit .",
    "indeed we will see that the interesting low temperature behaviour of @xmath85 is controlled by lifetime effects due to inelastic scattering .",
    "when the superconductor gets very dirty , the elastic lifetime becomes much shorter than the inelastic one and the low temperature behaviour is similar to the standard weak coupling bcs result and therefore uninteresting for our purpose .",
    "we note also that , if we have in mind a comparison with experiment , the dirty limit is not relevant for high @xmath1 compounds which are more or less on the clean side because @xmath1 is so high . therefore the clean limit is physically the interesting one .",
    "however eq.(1 ) and ( 4 ) will be useful for comparison .",
    "let us start with the simplest case , namely the einstein spectrum , in order to have a reference for comparison .",
    "we display in fig.2 the results for an einstein spectrum , which corresponds to take our parameter p = 0 or 1 , the value of r being then irrelevant .",
    "we do not give the values of our exponents @xmath86 for these einstein spectra since they range typically from 5 to 10 and a power law is clearly a very poor way to describe the low temperature behaviour for them as it is clear from fig.2 .",
    "the @xmath19 = 0 curve is naturally the bcs result . at the beginning ,",
    "when the coupling strength starts to increase , @xmath2 becomes flat at even higher temperature than in the bcs result .",
    "this is just the effect of the increase with @xmath19 of the ratio 2 @xmath87 / @xmath1 . indeed , as it is seen from eq.(4 ) , the flattening of @xmath2 starts when all excitations have essentially disappeared .",
    "since the gap @xmath87 gives the minimum energy for creating an excitation , the temperature at which @xmath2 becomes flat scales with @xmath88 however when we have , say , @xmath19 @xmath36 4 , this evolution is reversed and the low temperature dependence gets stronger .",
    "when we reach @xmath19 @xmath89 , we are already back to the @xmath90 behaviour . since we have specifically in mind here the low temperature behaviour , it is of interest to fully understand physically the origin of this somewhat surprising evolution .",
    "since this behaviour appears on the strong coupling side , we will understand it by considering the strong coupling limit , where the coupling constant @xmath19 goes to infinity , while we let at the same time the phonons frequencies go to zero in order to keep for example @xmath19 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath36 = 1 in order to keep the critical temperature fixed ( here we do not restrict ourselves to an einstein spectrum and consider rather a general spectrum ) .",
    "this limit has already been investigated in various papers @xcite .",
    "however for our purpose it is more interesting not to let @xmath7 go strictly to zero , but to take it very small in order to avoid singularities at low temperature . because of the factor @xmath91 , the dominant contribution in the sums in eq.(2 ) comes from the terms with @xmath92 - @xmath93 at most of order a few times @xmath94 when @xmath7 becomes very small",
    ", @xmath95 @xmath96 + @xmath97 @xmath98 is almost constant over this range since @xmath7 will be very small compared to @xmath99 therefore the sum can be performed explicitely which leads , to leading order , to :    @xmath100    where @xmath101 is the bose - einstein distribution .",
    "the analytic continuation of this simple result toward the real axis :    @xmath102    can also be obtained directly from the real axis eliashberg equations .",
    "the physical meaning of eq.(5 ) and ( 6 ) is quite clear .",
    "the very low frequency phonons behave like quasi - impurities @xcite .",
    "when they are absorbed or emitted , they produce the same result as impurities with a scattering time @xmath103 given by @xmath104 = @xmath105 @xmath19 @xmath26 @xmath7 @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath108 as it can be seen by comparing eq.(4 ) and ( 6 ) ( one would get the same result for @xmath104 in the normal state ) . in other words in this limit @xmath81",
    "is physically dominated by lifetime effects .",
    "when this result is carried into eq.(1 ) one finds naturally the dirty limit with @xmath103 as scattering time :    @xmath109    the last factor , which contains the sum over matsubara frequencies , gives a very regular function of temperature .",
    "this function is given in @xcite .",
    "it goes to a constant @xcite when t @xmath110 0 .",
    "therefore the low temperature behaviour of @xmath62 ( t ) is given by @xmath111 .",
    "as long as @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath7 , @xmath62 ( t ) diverges as t @xmath114 , because the number of thermally excited phonons is proportional to t : when the temperature is lowered the number of scattering processes decreases which produces the growth of @xmath62 ( t ) .",
    "naturally this divergence saturates for @xmath112 @xmath115 @xmath7 , since at zero temperature only the possibility of spontaneous phonon emission is left which gives @xmath116 = @xmath105 @xmath19 @xmath26 @xmath7 @xmath117 we come therefore to the conclusion that the increased low temperature dependence found when the coupling gets very strong is due to the low frequency phonons , which act as scatterers and whose number depends naturally on temperature .",
    "we turn now to our investigation of the apparent exponent for the low t behaviour of 1 - @xmath45 / @xmath118 since we have already explored the strong coupling limit we can restrict ourselves to  reasonable  values for the coupling constant @xmath119 specifically we consider @xmath19 going from 2 to 8 . indeed for @xmath19",
    "= 1 we have found results rather similar to the bcs result with fairly large exponents ( of order 4 or more ) which have little interest .",
    "similarly we do not show the results for a spectral width parameter r = 2 , since they do not depart very much from what is found for einstein spectra .",
    "we consider first the results for r = 4 , which are displayed in fig.3 .",
    "since p = 0 or 1 correspond to einstein spectra , we give only the results for 0.1 @xmath120 p @xmath120 0.9 .",
    "while for 0.1 @xmath121 p @xmath120 0.5 , it is plain that a power law does not agree with the theoretical results , remarkably it becomes a reasonable representation for 0.6 @xmath120 p @xmath120 0.9 , mainly for high values of @xmath119 indeed if we accept an uncertainty of @xmath122 10% on the exponent ( it is not easy to obtain a better result experimentally ) we find a power law for 0.7 @xmath120 p @xmath120 0.9 provided @xmath123 in particular for p = 0.8 we find that for @xmath19 = 4 ( @xmath124 = 3.55 ) , 6 ( @xmath124 = 2.95 ) and 8 ( @xmath124 = 2.72 ) the temperature dependence is remarkably well described by a power law .",
    "this is somewhat surprising since we know theoretically that this dependence is not a power law , and there is no obvious reasons why it comes so close to be one .",
    "we might indeed have anticipated that all our results would behave the way they do for , say , p @xmath120 0.5 .",
    "naturally the fact that @xmath56 = @xmath58 does not imply that we have exactly a straight line on our log - log plot , and we might worry that it has actually a sizeable oscillation .",
    "one can check directly that it is not so : the difference with a straight line is quite small and could certainly not be seen experimentally .",
    "we give right below a specific example of this .",
    "when we look for larger values of the spectral width , we find that the range of parameters where a power law gives a good description gets larger and that the exponents decrease . this is seen on fig.4 where we present our results for r = 6 . for 0.6 @xmath120 p @xmath120 0.8",
    "we obtain good power laws within @xmath125 10% down to @xmath19 = 3 . for p = 0.75",
    "we find @xmath124 = 2.6 for @xmath19 = 4 .",
    "this exponent is already rather near experimental results .",
    "we show on fig.5 the result for 1 - @xmath45 / @xmath46 compared with an exact power law .",
    "it is clear that it would not be possible experimentally to make the difference between the power law and the strong coupling result for temperature below 0.5 @xmath1 . for p=0.7 and @xmath19 = 8",
    "one finds a @xmath126 law .",
    "the results for r = 8 displayed on fig.6 show the same trends .",
    "the domain where we have a power law within @xmath127 extends now from p = 0.5 to p = 0.8 and starts almost from @xmath19 = 2 . for p",
    "= 0.7 and @xmath19 = 4 we find an exponent @xmath124 = 2.15 .",
    "finally one sees on fig.7 , where we show the results for r = 16 , that exponents markedly below 2 and actually not so far from 1 can be obtained .",
    "for example for p = 0.6 and @xmath19 = 4 we have @xmath124 = 1.51 .",
    "the domain with a power law within @xmath127 goes from p = 0.4 to p = 0.7 , starting from @xmath19 = 2 .",
    "we complete our results by displaying in fig.8 the prefactor of the approximate power laws that we have obtained for r = 4 , 8 and 16 ( this prefactor is calculated between t / @xmath1 = 0.2 and 0.5 using our exponent @xmath57 ) . we give only the results for the values of p where a power law is a good approximation .",
    "the prefactor that we find is always of order unity .",
    "this means that the power law that we find at low temperature is not a small effect since its extrapolation for t = @xmath1 gives for 1 - @xmath45 / @xmath46 a result of order unity .",
    "naturally the parameters where we find very good power laws correspond to the region where one switches from @xmath56 @xmath26 @xmath57 @xmath26 @xmath58 to @xmath58 @xmath26 @xmath57 @xmath26 @xmath56 for the order of our exponents .",
    "we have found above that this crossing occurs in the region p @xmath128 @xmath129 0.1 .",
    "however since p = 0 or 1 corresponds to an einstein spectrum , the exponents must be in the same order for p = 0 and 1 which implies that there must be another crossing region .",
    "this region is actually very near p = 1 ( for r = 4 and @xmath19 = 3 it occurs for p = 0.98 , and for higher values of r it goes closer to p = 1 ) .",
    "this means that the spectrum has a very small low frequency component , which makes this kind of spectrum somewhat pathological and unlikely to be relevant experimentally .",
    "the exponents corresponding to this crossing are also fairly high which makes them quite uninteresting .",
    "therefore we do not discuss this region further .",
    "in contrast the region which we have considered above corresponds to quite standard spectra and the exponents are similar to what is found experimentally .",
    "it is worthwhile to try to understand the physical origin of this appearance of quasi - power laws with small exponents .",
    "since this feature develops when the spectral width gets large , it is useful to consider the large spectral width limit , which corresponds to let go to infinity our parameter r in the two peaks representation .",
    "this is equivalent to let the frequency @xmath15 of the lower peak go to zero , while we keep at the same time the higher frequency peak @xmath16 fixed ( we can take for example @xmath16 as unity ) . physically , in the same way as we have seen for the strong coupling limit , the low frequency phonons will behave as impurities .",
    "they disappear from the equation for the gap function .",
    "therefore @xmath68 as well as @xmath1 are given by the einstein spectrum result with frequency @xmath16 and coupling strength @xmath130 on the other hand the low frequency phonons still contribute to @xmath69 by the m = n term .",
    "this produces the same effect as introducing additional scattering with a lifetime @xmath131 = @xmath105 @xmath132 .",
    "this leads for the penetration depth to :    @xmath133    where , as explained above , @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the solution of eliashberg equations for an einstein spectrum with frequency @xmath16 and coupling strength @xmath18 .",
    "as one might have expected , this result is just the general formula eq.(1 ) with the impurity lifetime replaced by the contribution from low frequency phonons .",
    "it is clear from eq.(8 ) that , because of the term @xmath136 the low frequency phonons depress @xmath62 ( t ) below what would be obtained from an einstein spectrum alone .",
    "hence they give for @xmath61 @xmath137 at low temperature a dependence which is stronger than the standard bcs one .",
    "therefore the low frequency phonons are responsible for development of the low temperature dependence when the width of the spectrum increases .",
    "however there is no obvious reason why this dependence can get close to a power law .",
    "nevertheless we note that eq.(8 ) gives a linear t dependence for @xmath61 @xmath137 at low temperature ( naturally our limiting case corresponds to a situation where @xmath15 @xmath115 t ) .",
    "we show on fig.9 the result of the calculation when the coupling strength of the high frequency peak is equal to @xmath18 = 3 .",
    "the coupling strength @xmath17 of the low frequency phonons takes the values m @xmath18 /(10 -m ) and the integer m goes from 0 to 9 .",
    "the values of @xmath17 for m @xmath138 6 are quite large and are just given to show the trend .",
    "it is interesting to note that the heavy line on this figure , which corresponds to @xmath17 = 1.28 , is quite similar to the experimental results of ref.@xcite .",
    "in this paper we have explored the effect of strong coupling on the low temperature behaviour of the penetration depth in the simplest model , namely for an isotropic attractive interaction leading to s - wave pairing .",
    "quite surprisingly and unexpectedly we have found that strong coupling effects can mimick a power law dependence , for a sizeable range of parameters , sometimes with an excellent precision .",
    "physically we have been able to ascribe this strong t dependence to low frequency phonons which produce a quasi elastic scattering for electrons , but we have not found any deeper theoretical reasons for these quasi - power laws .",
    "the presence of these low frequency phonons below @xmath1 requires rather wide phonon spectra and their effectiveness in scattering implies fairly strong coupling .    let us try to apply our results to the case of high @xmath1 superconductors .",
    "although we have found that one can obtain in principle a linear low temperature dependence from strong coupling effects , it seems completely unlikely that such an interpretation applies to the linear dependence found recently in ybco @xcite because our parameters are too extreme in terms of phonon frequency and coupling strength . on the other hand our results are of interest for other high @xmath1 compounds",
    ": if we take the experimental results showing a dependence not so far from a @xmath4 law , as it is quite often found @xcite in bissco , our results are rather close to provide an alternative explanation although our coupling strength is a bit too high and the spectrum we require somewhat too wide to agree with the experimental information presently available .    on the other hand",
    "we have only investigated here the isotropic case .",
    "it is clear that , if we consider some anisotropy , the effects that we have found will be increased . indeed , as we see from eq.(8 ) , the inverse lifetime due to low frequency phonons is in direct competition with the size of the gap .",
    "anisotropy will make the gap smaller at some places on the fermi surface , thereby increasing the effect of low frequency phonons and leading to the possibility of having a power law at low t for reasonable values of the parameters . in this way",
    "strong coupling effects might be quite relevant to the understanding of experimental results . in this respect",
    "it is worth pointing out that most high @xmath1 microscopic theories claiming to perform a reliable critical temperature calculation are strong coupling theories with coupling constants at least of order unity .",
    "this is in particular the case for spin fluctuations microscopic theories such as the mmp @xcite or the ruln @xcitecalculations",
    ". how strong should be the coupling in these compounds is still naturally a matter of debate",
    ". however strong coupling effects are generally completely overlooked in the interpretation of experiments on the low temperature behaviour of @xmath139 our results show that this might be dangerous . another way to put it is to say that , when something happens at low temperature , one should not only look at the fermionic degrees of freedom for an explanation , but one should also consider the possibility that bosonic degrees of freedom might be at least partly responsible for the effect .",
