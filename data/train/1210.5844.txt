    "as an offspring of the wide interest in frame representations and sparsity promoting techniques for data recovery , proximal methods have become popular for solving large - size non - smooth convex optimization problems @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of these methods in the solution of inverse problems has been widely studied in the recent signal and image processing literature ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) . even if proximal algorithms and the associated convergence properties have been deeply investigated @xcite , some questions persist in their use for solving inverse problems .",
    "a first question is : how can we set the parameters serving to enforce the regularity of the solution in an automatic way ?",
    "various strategies were proposed in order to address this question @xcite , but the computational cost of these methods is often high , especially when several regularization parameters have to be set .",
    "alternatively , it has been recognized for a long time that incorporating constraints directly on the solutions @xcite , instead of considering regularized functions , may often facilitate the choice of the involved parameters .",
    "indeed , in a constrained formulation , the constraint bounds are usually related to some physical properties of the target solution or some knowledge of the degradation process , e.g. the noise statistical properties .",
    "note also that there exist some conceptual lagrangian equivalences between regularized solutions to inverse problems and constrained ones , although some caution should be taken when the regularization functions are nonsmooth ( see @xcite where the case of a single regularization parameter is investigated ) .",
    "another question is related to the selection of the most appropriate algorithm within the class of proximal methods according to a given application .",
    "this also raises the question of the computation of the proximity operators associated with the different functions involved in the criterion . in this context , the objective of this paper is to propose an efficient splitting technique for solving some constrained convex optimization problems of the form :    [ p : gen ] @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a real hilbert space , and    1 .   for every @xmath4",

    "decomposable loss _ , i.e.  it can be expressed as the sum of functions evaluated over different blocks of the vector @xmath17 , the problem of computing the projection onto the associated convex set @xmath12 can be addressed by resorting to a splitting approach that decomposes the set @xmath12 into a collection of epigraphs and a half - space ; 2 .   the projection operator associated with an epigraph ( namely the _ epigraphical projection _ ) has a closed form for some functions of practical interest , such as the absolute value raised to a power @xmath18 , the distance to a convex set and the @xmath19-norm with @xmath20 ; 3 .   in the context of image restoration ,",
    "regularity constraints based on total variation @xcite and non - local total variation @xcite can be efficiently handled by the proposed epigraphical splitting , which significantly speeds up the convergence ( in terms of execution time ) with respect to standard iterative solutions @xcite .",

    "[ sec : rec ] , we review the algorithms which are applicable for solving large - size convex optimization problems , so motivating the choice of proximal methods , and we review the variable - splitting techniques commonly used with these methods . in order to deal with a constraint expressed under the form , we propose in section [ sec : proposed ] a novel splitting approach involving an epigraphical projection .",

    "experiments in two different contexts are presented in section  [ sec : exp ] .",

    "the indicator function @xmath38 of @xmath35 is given by @xmath39 the projection onto @xmath35 reads @xmath40 , and the distance to @xmath35 is given by @xmath41 .",
    "the first methods for finding a solution to an inverse problem were restricted to the use of a differentiable cost function @xcite , i.e. problem  [ p : gen ] where @xmath42 and , for every @xmath4 , @xmath43 denotes a differentiable function . in this context ,",
    "gradient - based algorithms appear to be the most efficients solutions when an iterative procedure is required ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , in order to model additional properties , sparsity promoting penalizations ( @xmath44 ) or hard constraints ( @xmath45 ) may be introduced and the diffentiability property is not satisfied anymore .",
    "one way to circumvent this difficulty is to resort to smart approximations in order to smooth the involved non - differentiable functions @xcite .",
    "if one wants to address the original nonsmooth problem without approximation errors , one may apply some specific algorithms @xcite , the convergence of which is guaranteed under restrictive assumptions .",
    "interior point methods @xcite can also be employed for small to medium size optimization problems .    on the other hand , in order to solve convex feasibility problems , i.e. to find a vector belonging to the intersection of convex sets ( problem  [ p : gen ] with @xmath46 ) , iterative projection methods were developed .",
    "the projection onto convex sets algorithm ( pocs ) is one of the most popular approach to solve data recovery problems @xcite .",
    "a drawback of pocs is that it is not well - suited for parallel implementations .",
    "the parallel projection method ( ppm ) and method of parallel projections ( mopp ) are variants of pocs making use of parallel projections .",
    "moreover , these algorithms were designed to efficiently solve inconsistent feasibility problems ( when the intersection of the convex set is empty ) .",
    "thorough comparisons between projection methods have been performed in @xcite .",
    "computing the projection @xmath47 onto a nonempty closed convex subset @xmath35 of a real hilbert space @xmath3 requires to solve a constrained quadratic minimization problem .",
    "however , it turns out that a closed form expression of the solution to this problem is available in a limited number of instances .",
    "some well - known examples are the projections onto hyperplanes , closed half - spaces and @xmath48-norm balls @xcite .",
    "when an expression of the direct projection is not available , the convex set @xmath35 can be approximated by a half - space , which leads to the concept of subgradient projection .",
    "an efficient block iterative surrogate splitting method was proposed in @xcite in order to solve problem  [ p : gen ] when @xmath45 and , for every @xmath4 , @xmath49 where @xmath50 . a main limitation of this method is that the global objective function must be strictly convex . for recent works about subgradient projection methods , the readers may refer to @xcite .    a way to overcome this difficulty consists of considering proximal approaches .",
    "the key tool in these methods is the proximity operator @xcite of a function @xmath51 , defined as @xmath52 the proximity operator can be interpreted as a sort of subgradient step for the function @xmath27 , as @xmath53 is uniquely defined through the inclusion @xmath54 proximity operators enjoy many interesting properties @xcite . in particular , they generalize the notion of projection onto a closed convex set @xmath35 , in the sense that @xmath55 .",
    "hence , proximal methods provide a unifying framework that allows one to address non - smooth penalizations ( @xmath56 ) and hard constraints ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the class of proximal methods includes primal algorithms @xcite and primal - dual algorithms @xcite .",
    "primal algorithms generally require to inverse some linear operators ( e.g.  @xmath57 ) , while primal - dual ones only require to compute @xmath58 , @xmath59 and their adjoints . consequently , primal - dual methods are often easier to implement than primal ones , but their convergence may be slower @xcite .",
    "note also that some of these methods are closely related to augmented lagrangian approaches @xcite .      with the development of proximal methods for solving convex optimization problems",
    ", many techniques have been developed to cope with the intrinsic limitations of these methods .",
    "in particular , the computation of the proximity operator becomes intractable in general when considering the sum of several functions or a function composed with a linear operator . in this context ,",
    "variable - splitting constitutes a very effective way to design easily implementable algorithms .",
    "one of the most popular examples is given by the approaches inspired by the alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) , which deal with optimization problems of the form @xmath60 by introducing an auxiliary variable @xmath61 , the problem is reformulated as @xmath62 this kind of splitting technique has been often used in image restoration @xcite and more recently for distributed optimization problems @xcite .",
    "a similar form of splitting has been considered in @xcite , where the constraint @xmath63 is handled by computing the projection onto the nullspace of the linear operator @xmath64 $ ] , which has a closed - form expression for some specific choices of @xmath65 , such as circulant matrices involved in image restoration .",
    "the solution that we will propose in this work also introduces auxiliary variables . however , our objective is not to deal with linear transformations of the data but with a projection which does not have a closed - form expression .",
    "consequently , the proposed solution departs from the usual splitting methods , in the sense that our approach leads to a collection of epigraphs and a half - space constraint sets , while the usual splitting techniques yield linear constraints .",

    "the constraint @xmath66 can be split into the two constraints @xmath84 and @xmath85 , provided that an additional vector @xmath86 is introduced in problem  [ p : gen ] .",

    "<S> we propose a proximal approach to deal with a class of convex variational problems involving nonlinear constraints . a large family of constraints , proven to be effective in the solution of inverse problems , </S>",
    "<S> can be expressed as the lower level set of a sum of convex functions evaluated over different , but possibly overlapping , blocks of the signal . </S>",
    "<S> for such constraints , the associated projection operator generally does not have a simple form . </S>",
    "<S> we circumvent this difficulty by splitting the lower level set into as many epigraphs as functions involved in the sum . </S>",
    "<S> a closed half - space constraint is also enforced , in order to limit the sum of the introduced epigraphical variables to the upper bound of the original lower level set . in this paper , we focus on a family of constraints involving linear transforms of distance functions to a convex set or @xmath0 norms with @xmath1 . in these cases , the projection onto the epigraph of the involved function has a closed form expression .    </S>",
    "<S> the proposed approach is validated in the context of image restoration with missing samples , by making use of constraints based on non - local total variation . </S>",
    "<S> experiments show that our method leads to significant improvements in term of convergence speed over existing algorithms for solving similar constrained problems . a second application to a pulse shape design problem </S>",
    "<S> is provided in order to illustrate the flexibility of the proposed approach . </S>"
