    "the development of the cauchy theory for analytic functions provided some of the classic machinery suitable for such investigations , including rouch s theorem , the argument principle and the routh - hurwitz condition for left - half plane stability .",
    "we mention these results not only because they are powerful tools , but also because they embody a fundamental dichotomy .",
    "explicit criteria for the location of the zeros of a polynomial in terms of its coefficients may severely restrict the domain to which they apply , whereas ubiquitous applicability of a theorem to various domains may render the result difficult to use .",
    "+ the gauss - lucas theorem , relating the location of the zeros of @xmath4 to those of the polynomial @xmath5 , pioneered a new approach to an old question : instead of studying the zeros of a function , one can study the behavior of the zero set of a function under certain operators . in this light ,",
    "given the taylor expansion of a ( real ) entire function @xmath6 , one can interpret @xmath7 as the result of the sequence @xmath8 acting on the function @xmath9 by forming a hadamard product .",
    "thus , complex sequences have a dual nature : they are coefficients of ` polynomials of infinite degree ' (  la euler ) , as well as linear operators on @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "g. plya and j. schur s 1914 paper @xcite was a major mile stone in understanding how sequences ( as linear operators ) affect the location of the zeros of polynomials .",
    "more precisely , plya and schur gave a classification of real sequences that preserve reality of zeros of real polynomials , and initiated a research program on stability preserving linear operators on circular domains , which was recently completed by j. borcea and p. brndn ( @xcite ) .",
