    "mechanical alloying ( ma ) technique @xcite is an efficient means for synthesizing crystalline and amorphous materials , as well as stable and metastable solid solutions @xcite .",
    "ma has also been used to produce materials with nanometer sized grains and alloys whose components have large differences in their melting temperatures and are thus difficult to produce using techniques based on melting .",
    "the few thermodynamics restrictions on the alloy composition open up a wide range of possibilities for property combinations even for immiscible elements @xcite . since temperatures reached in ma are usually very low , this low temperature process reduces reaction kinetics , allowing the production of poorly crystallized or amorphous materials .",
    "recently , we have used ma to produce amorphous ni@xmath4ti@xmath5 @xcite and partially amorphous fe@xmath4ti@xmath5 @xcite alloys .",
    "ni - ti alloys are biocompatible and can be used to produced shape memory materials , and fe - ti alloys can be used as hydrogen storage materials .",
    "it is known that various cobalt - rich co - tm ( tm = transition metals ) amorphous alloys obtained by sputtering can provide good soft magnetic characteristics , such as high saturation magnetization and low coercivity . however , sputtering produces only thin amorphous films @xcite , and melt - spinning has some problems in preparing amorphous ribbon and powders @xcite .",
    "thus , here we have used ma to produce an amorphous co@xmath0ti@xmath1 alloy ( _ a_-co@xmath0ti@xmath1 ) starting from the crystalline elemental powders .",
    "its structural properties were studied by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) and extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) techniques . due to its selectivity and high sensitivity to the chemical environment around a specific type of atom of an alloy ,",
    "exafs @xcite is a technique very suitable to investigate the local atomic order of crystalline compounds and amorphous alloys .",
    "anomalous wide angle x - ray scattering ( awaxs ) is also a selective technique , but due to the small @xmath6 that can be achieved on ti k - edge ( @xmath7 @xmath8 ) , little information could be obtained from an awaxs experiment on this edge . on the other hand ,",
    "exafs measurements performed on ti edge extended to @xmath9 @xmath8 . using this technique ,",
    "we have determined coordination numbers and interatomic distances in the first coordination shell of _ a_-co@xmath0ti@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , we have modelled the atomic structure of _ a_-co@xmath0ti@xmath1 by using an additive hard sphere ( ahs ) model ( in which the minimum distance between unlike atoms is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the closest approach distance between the centers of atoms @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , to perform the deconvolution of the radial distribution functions ( rdf@xmath2 ) .",
    "the coordination numbers and interatomic distances obtained from the ahs - rdf model were compared to those found from exafs , and the exafs results obtained indicated a shortening in the co - ti and ti - ti distances when compared to those found by the ahs - rdf method .",
    "we have also compared the structural parameters of the alloy with those found in the bcc - co@xmath3ti compound . in spite of some differences ,",
    "coordination numbers obtained from exafs and ahs - rdf are similar to each other and also to those found in bcc - co@xmath3ti .",
    "according to faber and ziman @xcite , the total structure factor @xmath14 is obtained from the scattered intensity per atom @xmath15 through    @xmath16}{\\langle f(k)\\rangle^2 } \\label{eqstructurefactor1 } \\\\ & = & \\sum_{i=1}^n{\\sum_{j=1}^n{w_{ij}(k ) { \\cal s}_{ij}(k ) } } \\ , , \\label{eqstructurefactor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is the transferred momentum , @xmath18 are the partial structure factors and    @xmath19    and    @xmath20 ^ 2 \\ , .",

    "in the ahs model for a binary alloy , the interacting potentials between particles @xmath12 and @xmath13 are    @xmath30    where @xmath11 is the closest approach distance between the centers of the particles @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and    @xmath31    that is , the minimum approach between unlike atoms is always equal to the arithmetic mean of the diameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 of the two species . for this model , the percus - yevick ( py ) equation , which can be applied to systems in which short range forces",
    "are dominant , has an exact solution , making it possible to obtain analytical expressions for the partial pair distribution functions and partial structure factors . in 1977 ,",
    "weeks @xcite used the py model to study the atomic structure of metallic glasses , assuming an isotropic and homogeneous phase that does not occur in the solid state .",
    "the extension of the py model to study the glassy state is based on the structural characteristics of amorphous state , which can be considered as an extrapolation of the atomic structure of the liquid state .",
    "a good review of the ahs model is given in ref .",
    "blended co ( vetec , 99.7% , particle size @xmath34 @xmath35 m ) and ti ( bdh , 99.5% , particle size @xmath34 @xmath35 m ) elemental powders , with nominal composition co@xmath4ti@xmath5 , were sealed together with several steel balls ( with diameter of about 1 cm ) , under an argon atmosphere , in a steel vial .",
    "the ball - to - powder weight ratio was 5:1 .",
    "the vial was mounted in a high energy ball mill spex mixer / mill model 8000 ( working at 1200 rpm ) and milled for 10 h. a ventilation system was used to keep the vial temperature close to room temperature .",
    "the composition of the as - milled powder was measured using the energy dispersive spectroscopy ( eds ) technique , giving a composition of 57 at .",
    "% and 43 at .",
    "% of co and ti , respectively , and impurity traces were not observed .",
    "xrd measurements were recorded on a siemens diffractometer with a graphite monochromator in the diffracted beam , using the cu k@xmath36 line ( @xmath37  ) .",
    "@xmath14 was computed from the xrd patterns , after standard corrections following the procedure described by wagner @xcite .",
    "the samples for the exafs measurements were formed by placing the powder onto a porous menbrane ( millipore , 0.2 @xmath35 m pore size ) in order to achive optimal thickness ( about 30 @xmath35 m ) , and neither kapton tape nor bn were used .",
    "the exafs measurements were taken at room temperature in the transmission mode on the d04b beam line of lnls ( campinas , brazil ) , using a channel cut monochromator ( si 111 ) and two ionization chambers filled by air as detectors , working at 10% and 70% efficiency , respectively , and the beam size at the sample was about 3 @xmath38 1 mm .",
    "this yielded a resolution of about 2.0 ev on ti k edge and 2.5 ev on co k edge , respectively . at these energies ,",
    "harmonic rejection is irrelevant at the d04b beam line .",
    "the energy and average current of the storage ring were 1.37 gev and 120 ma , respectively .",

    "we used the ahs model to obtain @xmath40 and @xmath41 for a system with the same composition of the alloy .",
    "it is well known that the intensity of the main halo of the total structure factor @xmath42 generated by the ahs model is larger than the experimental one .",
    "thus , @xmath42 has to be multiplied by a @xmath43 function in order to introduce a ` thermal ' effect .",
    "the best agreement between the experimental @xmath24 and @xmath44 functions were achieved when the packing fraction parameter and @xmath45 values were 0.76 and 0.07 @xmath46 , respectively .",

    "there is an excellent agreement concerning peak positions , in particular the first one , but there are some differences in the intensities of the peaks starting from the second one , which could be explained by the features of the ahs model .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ahs model was developed to investigate atomic structures of glassy alloys in the liquid state and , as the chemical short - range order ( csro ) of the alloy becomes stronger , it is not able to reproduce the structural features of the alloy anymore .",
    "thus , the differences reported above can be associated with the presence of a csro in _ a_-co@xmath0ti@xmath1 .",
    "this csro probably is not much strong since the differences between experimental and ahs data are not very large .",
    "the density of the amorphous alloy can be calculated from the slope of the straight line ( @xmath47 ) fitting the initial part ( until the first minimum ) of the @xmath24 function @xcite .",

    "in addition , coordination numbers determined by exafs have an error of about 1 atom for this kind of alloys .",
    "however , except for the co - co interatomic distance , ahs - rdf results overestimate distance values , which could be explained by the considerations made in the definition of the ahs model .",
    "this decrease in the distances is not unexpected because , according to hausleitner and hafner @xcite , which investigated several amorphous alloys formed by transition metals ( tm - ti ) using molecular dynamics simulations , obtaining structure factors , coordination numbers and interatomic distances , if the components of an alloy have a large difference in the number of @xmath68 electrons there is a pronounced non - additivity of the pair interactions and a strong interaction between unlike atoms , thus decreasing the distance between chemically different atoms .",

    "a_-co@xmath0ti@xmath1 shows some differences when compared to that found in the bcc - co@xmath3ti compound .",
    "the compositional difference may explain the disagreement between co - ti coordination numbers , but there is an important reduction in the co - ti distance in the amorphous alloy , whereas co - co and ti - ti distances increase .",
    "these features usually are attributed to the preparation technique , that introduces many defects and vacancies in the alloy , and they have also been reported for other alloys produced by ma @xcite .    in order to estimate the csro in the alloy we used the generalized warren parameter @xmath74 given by @xcite    @xmath75    where @xmath65 are the coordination numbers and @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
