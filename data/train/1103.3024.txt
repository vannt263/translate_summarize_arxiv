    "soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) are neutron stars that are identified by the repeated bursts they emit in hard x - rays and soft gamma - rays . during their burst active phases ,",
    "sgrs emit anywhere from a few to thousands of short bursts , typically lasting a fraction of a second .",
    "energy released during such a short time is very large , ranging from @xmath3  erg to 10@xmath4  erg . on rare occasions , sgrs emit extremely energetic giant flares , lasting for a few hundreds of seconds and releasing a total energy in excess of @xmath5  erg ( palmer et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "sgrs also display persistent bright x - ray emission with luminosities of the order of l@xmath6  erg  s@xmath7 , which significantly exceeds the spindown power that can be generated by these slowly rotating neutron stars .",
    "both the persistent x - ray emission and the energetic bursts led to the interpretation of sgrs as extremely magnetized neutron stars , or magnetars ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; see woods & thompson 2006 for a detailed review ) . within the magnetar paradigm , the decay of a very strong magnetic field ( @xmath8  g ) powers the persistent emission from sgrs ( thompson & duncan 1996 ) , while the observed bursts are attributed either to cracking of the neutron crust that is strained by magnetic stress ( thompson & duncan 1995 ) or to magnetic reconnection ( lyutikov 2003 ) .    large period derivatives , of the order of @xmath9  s  s@xmath7 measured from numerous sgrs in the past indicated large inferred dipole spindown fields @xmath10  g , thus lending further support to the magnetar character of these sources ( e.g. , kouveliotou 1998 ) .",
    "when models of high magnetic field neutron star atmospheres and magnetospheres were used to fit to the continuum x - ray spectra of magnetars , these analyses also yielded magnetic field strengths that are comparable to the inferred dipole fields with a typical range of 2 @xmath11 5 @xmath12 10@xmath13 gauss ( e.g. , gver et al .",

    "the ubiquitous presence of large period derivatives in sgrs is now being challenged by the unusually small period derivative measured in sgr  0418 + 5729 .",
    "early attempts to obtain its period derivative , and therefore , to establish its inferred dipolar magnetic field strength , were inconclusive ( woods et al .",
    "2009 ; kuiper & hermsen 2009 ; esposito et al . 2010 ) . using multi - satellite observations spanning over 440 days following the onset of the outburst from this source , rea et al .",
    "( 2010 ) recently reported a 2@xmath14 upper limit to the period derivative , implying that the inferred dipolar magnetic field strength of sgr  0418 + 5729  should be less than @xmath0  g.    sgr 0418 + 5729 is a `` regular '' sgr in every other way and a transient magnetar candidate ( rea & esposito 2011 ) : it was discovered on 2009 june 5 by emitting two bursts detected with gbm on board fermi gamma - ray space telescope ( van der horst et al .",
    "the energy released by these two events were modest , totaling @xmath15  erg and @xmath16  erg in the 20@xmath17200 kev band .",
    "rossi x - ray timing explorer observations of the source following the discovery revealed the 9.07  s spin period ( g et al .",
    "detectors on board swift , fermi , and rxte have allowed a growing number of transient magnetars to be discovered in the recent years , which are first detected via bursting activity and accompanied persistent flux increase up to several orders of magnitude .",
    "persistent flux of these transient sources decreases back to quiescent level ( @xmath18 10@xmath19 erg  @xmath20  s@xmath7 ) on a time scale of months to years ( rea & esposito 2011 ) .",
    "x - ray output variation of sgr  0418 + 5729  also very much resembles that of transient magnetar candidates : the 1@xmath1710  kev flux rapidly increased in conjunction with bursting and subsequently decayed by a factor of 10 over a time span of @xmath21150 days ( esposito et al .",
    "sgr  0418 + 5729  is located towards the galactic anti - center and likely to be in the perseus arm or the outer - arm of our galaxy with a distance of @xmath182 kpc or higher ( van der horst et al .",
    "2010 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to place constraints on the magnetic field strength of sgr  0418 + 5729   using x - ray spectroscopy . to this end",
    ", we analyze the high signal - to - noise x - ray spectrum of sgr  0418 + 5729   obtained from xmm - newton observations .",
    "we use a number of different x - ray spectral models to constrain the physical properties of the neutron star . in particular , we employ ( i ) the phenomenological blackbody plus power - law model that has been traditionally used to fit sgr spectra , ( ii ) the low - to - moderate magnetic field neutron star atmosphere model , or nsa ( pavlov et al . 1995 ; zavlin , pavlin , & shibanov 1996 ) , and ( iii ) the high magnetic field surface thermal emission and magnetospheric scattering ( stems ) model ( gver , et al . 2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "we find that the thermal spectrum of sgr  0418 + 5729  is best described by high magnetic field model .",
    "we also compare the magnetic field determined spectroscopically to the dipole magnetic field inferred from spindown . because the spectroscopically determined field probes the strength measured on the neutron star surface , whereas the dipole field is the one inferred at the light cylinder",
    ", this comparison can be revealing for the field geometry of sgr  0418 + 5729 .",
    "we introduce the xmm - newton data and our data reduction procedure in the next section . in  3 , we fit the spectrum with the three different continuum models . finally , we discuss the implications of the inferred surface magnetic field strength and compare our findings for this source with those of sgrs in general to address the possible differences between them in the final section .",
    "in the period following its discovery through its x - ray / soft - gamma - ray bursts , sgr  0418 + 5729   could not be observed immediately with pointing telescopes due to its unfavorable sky location . in particular ,",
    "swift xrt observations of the source could start about a month after the discovery , while the xmm - newton observation was performed about two months after . because the x - ray intensity of the source steadily declined following the outburst ( see figure 1 of esposito et al .",
    "2010 ) , only the large collecting area of xmm - newton was able to provide sufficiently high quality x - ray spectrum for the measurement of spectral parameters .",
    "we , therefore , use in this study the archival xmm - newton observation that took place on 2009 august 12 ( obs i d .",
    "0610000601 ) .",
    "we note that sgr  0418 + 5729   was still not in quiescence during the xmm - newton observation ( esposito et al .",
    "2010 ) . during this observation , the source count - rate as observed with the epic - pn and mos detectors were , 1.35 and 0.5 c  s@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "epic - pn and mos detectors were operated in small and partial window modes with time resolutions of 6 and 300 ms , respectively , to prevent photon pile - up .",
    "part of the xmm - newton observation , especially towards the end , was severely affected by large particle flares .",
    "we are , therefore , able to use @xmath1836  ks out of the total exposure time of 65  ks .",
    "we utilize data collected with both the epic - pn and epic - mos cameras .",
    "we used the _ epproc _ and _ emproc _ tasks for the epic - pn and epic - mos data with the science analysis software ( sas ) version 10.0.0 and the latest available calibration files as of december 2010 .",
    "we extracted x - ray spectra using a circular region with a radius of 32 arc - seconds centered on the source .",
    "similarly , background regions were selected from a source free region with a typical radius of 50 arc - second .",
    "we used the _ rmfgen _ and _ arfgen _ tools to create response and ancillary response files .",
    "we rebinned the x - ray spectra to have at least 30 counts per bin and not to oversample the intrinsic energy resolution of the detectors by more than a factor of 3 .",
    "we fit the data with xspec version 12.5.1n ( arnaud , 1996 ) . in all the fits",
    ", we used the _ tbabs _ model and the ism abundances ( wilms et al .",
    "2000 ) to account for the effects of interstellar absorption .",
    "the xmm - newton calibration team reported that the epic - mos detectors measure 5 - 8% higher fluxes than the epic - pn consistently over the whole energy band .",
    "however , the exact amount of this excess flux varies over different energy ranges .",
    "therefore , in all our fits we allowed the normalization parameters of the models to be free between the detectors and added a 1% systematic uncertainty to take into account the possible energy dependence of the uncertainties in instrumental calibrations .",
    "we calculated the unabsorbed flux using the _ cflux _ model in xspec .",
    "because of the above - mentioned calibration uncertainty , we only report the flux and/or emitting area values as measured with epic - pn . we assumed a gravitational redshift for the neutron star as 0.25 , corresponding to a neutron star mass of 1.4 m@xmath22 and radius of 11.5 km .",
    "we fit all spectra in the 0.5 to 6.5 kev energy range .",
    "unless otherwise noted , all the uncertainties quoted are for 68% confidence interval .",
    "we first fit the x - ray spectra using a combination of a blackbody ( _ bbodyrad _ as defined in xspec ) and a power - law model .",
    "we performed this analysis only as a phenomenological classification of the source spectrum because the atmospheric structure even for a weak or `` zero '' magnetic field has a strong effect on the spectral shape of the x - ray emission of neutron stars and has been shown to distort it away from a blackbody ( see e.g. romani  1988 ; pavlov et al.1995 ) .",
    "the spectrum and the best - fit model are shown in the left panel of figure  [ unfolded ] .",
    "blackbody plus power - law provided a moderate fit with a @xmath23/dof of 1.12 for 346 degrees of freedom .",
    "the best fit model resulted in a hydrogen column density of @xmath24  @xmath25 , a blackbody temperature of @xmath26  kev , and a photon index of the power - law component of @xmath27 .",
    "the temperature is unusually high for two reasons .",
    "first , the blackbody component dominates over the power - law component at high photon energies , i.e. , in the @xmath28  kev range , as can be seen in figure  [ unfolded ] , which is physically difficult to interpret and is also contrary to what is seen in the spectra of other sgrs .",
    "second , this high temperature corresponds to an extremely small emitting radius of 0.18  km/2kpc .",
    "such a small emitting radius is especially hard to interpret given the observed pulsed fraction of 20 - 40% in the soft x - rays ( esposito et al .",
    "2010 ) .    the current constraints on the period derivative of sgr  0418 + 5729  point to a dipolar magnetic field strength smaller than @xmath0  g. we , therefore , tried to fit the spectrum of sgr  0418 + 5729  with low to intermediate magnetic field strength neutron - star atmosphere models .",
    "the nsa model ( pavlov et al . 1995 ; zavlin , pavlin , & shibanov 1996 ) provides a model for the x - ray spectra emitted from a hydrogen atmosphere of a neutron star at three different magnetic field strengths : @xmath29  g , @xmath30  g , and @xmath31  g. the * fit * parameters of the nsa model , in addition to the magnetic field strength , are the neutron star mass and radius , the surface temperature , and the normalization , which is a function of the source distance @xmath32 .",
    "we consider the @xmath33  g case only for completeness , because it would be unfeasible to account for the x - ray pulsations observed from sgr  0418 + 5729  if indeed possessed a negligible magnetic field .",
    "for this case , the nsa model does not provide a good fit with a @xmath23/dof equal to 1.29 for 350 degrees of freedom and yields a best - fit surface temperature of 0.73  kev ( @xmath34  k ) . as with the blackbody - plus - power - law fit",
    ", this rather high temperature corresponds to a very small best fit normalization of @xmath35 , or equivalently an emitting radius of @xmath36  km/2  kpc .    at a field strength of @xmath37  g",
    ", the nsa model can not fit the spectrum of sgr  0418 + 5729 , yielding a minimum @xmath38 for 350 degrees of freedom .",
    "the surface temperature also hits @xmath39  k , which is the maximum of the allowed range in the models .",
    "finally , the obtained best fit normalization of @xmath40 translates to an unphysically small emitting radius of @xmath41  km/2  kpc .",
    "this indicates that the spectrum of sgr  0418 + 5729  is inconsistent with a surface magnetic field strength that is comparable to its dipole field strength inferred from its period derivative .",
    "we performed a final nsa fit where we set the magnetic field strength to @xmath42  g. the quality of the fit improved compared to the @xmath43  g case but is still not adequate , yielding a @xmath44 for 350 degrees of freedom .",
    "the best - fit temperature again hits the upper limit of the allowed range at @xmath39  k ( 0.86  kev ) , corresponding to a normalization of @xmath45 , which is an emitting radius of @xmath46  km/2  kpc .    in an attempt to obtain statistically better fits and to investigate whether additional spectral components would have an effect on the measured effective temperature values",
    ", we also modeled the x - ray spectrum of sgr  0418 + 5729  with an absorbed nsa plus a power - law model .",
    "we found that the addition of the power - law component statistically improved the fits , yielding @xmath23/dof values of 1.13 , 2.78 , and 1.49 for 346 degrees of freedom , when the magnetic field strength was set to 0 , 10@xmath47 , and 10@xmath48  g , respectively .",
    "however , the addition of the power - law component did not decrease the inferred effective temperature , resulting in values that still reached the upper temperature limit of the model . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ unfolded ] , we show the x - ray spectra and an example case for the nsa+pl models , where the strength of the magnetic field was set to @xmath43  g.    we finally modeled the spectrum of sgr  0418 + 5729  with magnetar strength fields in the few @xmath49  g range , which may reflect the higher multipole field strengths present at the stellar surface . to this end , we used the surface thermal emission and magnetospheric scattering model ( stems , see gver et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "stems takes into account the effects of the ultrastrong magnetic fields on the fully ionized hydrogen atmospheres of magnetars ( zel 2001 , 2003 ) and the resonant cyclotron scattering of the surface photons by mildly relativistic charges in the magnetosphere ( lyutikov & gavriil 2006 ) . for the calculation of the surface emission ,",
    "we follow zel ( 2001 , 2003 ) and solve the radiative transfer equations in a polarization - mode - dependent manner including the absorption , emission and scattering processes in the atmosphere .",
    "we also take into account the effects of vacuum polarization resonance and include the interaction of photons with protons in the plasma , which gives rise to absorption features at the proton cyclotron energy ( zel 2003 ) . in the stellar magnetosphere , we incorporate a treatment of resonant cyclotron scattering , following lyutikov & gavriil ( 2006 ) .",
    "resonant cyclotron scattering can take place in a neutron star magnetosphere as long as there is a sufficient density of moderately relativistic electrons and the resulting up - scattering shifts the initial spectrum to higher energies and smears out the proton cyclotron features ( lyutikov & gavriil 2006 ) .    in the stems model , we use the emission emerging from the surface as input for the resonant cyclotron scattering model to obtain the resulting energy distribution of photons . in total",
    "stems depends on four parameters : the surface effective temperature ( @xmath50  kev ) , the strength of the magnetic field at the surface ( @xmath51  g ) , the optical depth to scattering in the magnetosphere ( @xmath52 ) , and the velocity of the particles in the magnetosphere ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "note that , even though in the calculations of lyutikov & gavriil ( 2006 ) , a high optical depth is motivated by a twist angle , this is not a necessary assumption .",
    "such high charge densities are seen in the magnetospheres of even normal pulsars and the only difference between the sgr  0418 + 5729  and a neutron star with a magnetar - strength dipole field would be the occurrence of the resonant layers closer to the neutron star surface . as an example , based on the current limit on the dipole field of sgr  0418 + 5729",
    ", the resonant layer would be at 4  r@xmath54 , whereas for a quadrupole field that is 10@xmath13  g at the surface , the resonant layer would be at @xmath186  r@xmath54 .",
    "finally we take into account general relativistic effects on the propagation of the photons by assuming a gravitational redshift .",
    "compared to the blackbody plus a power - law fit , stems model provided an equally good fit to the xmm - newton spectrum , resulting in a @xmath23/dof of 1.18 for 347 degrees of freedom .",
    "we show the best fit model curve and the x - ray spectra in figure  [ spectra ] .",
    "the parameters of the best fit model were : the surface magnetic field strength @xmath55  g , the surface effective temperature @xmath56  kev , the scattering optical depth in the magnetosphere @xmath57 and the particle velocity in the magnetosphere @xmath58 . the inferred optical depth and the average electron velocity",
    "are well within the assumptions of the resonant cyclotron scattering model ( see .",
    "e.g. , section 3.4 of lyutikov & gavriil 2006 ) .",
    "we also found a hydrogen column density of @xmath59  @xmath25 and the unabsorbed 0.5 - 6.5 kev source flux as @xmath60  erg  s@xmath7  @xmath20 .",
    "the inferred emitting radius corresponding to this effective temperature and flux is @xmath61  km/2  kpc .",
    "we note that in this fit fractional emitting area , i.e. , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the entire neutron star surface area , is in the right range to produce the pulsed fraction of 20 - 40% , as observed by esposito et al .",
    "( 2010 ) in the soft x - rays .",
    "we present in figure  [ confidence ] the confidence contours of the best fit effective temperature and the magnetic field strength at the surface of the neutron star . from the confidence contours",
    "it can clearly be seen that the stems model provides a lower limit to the surface magnetic field strength of the neutron star of @xmath64  g. because our focus in this paper is the surface magnetic field strength of sgr  0418 + 5729 , we further explored the uncertainty in this parameter by doing the following : we fit the data by freezing the magnetic field at 1000 different points within the @xmath65  g range and allowing the other parameters to vary .",
    "figure  [ confidence ] shows the variation of the @xmath23/dof over the full magnetic field range investigated .",
    "it is evident from the distinct minimum in the @xmath66 in this figure that the magnetic field strength at the surface of the neutron star is uniquely constrained and is found to be @xmath2  g.",
    "the recent discovery and the subsequent observations of sgr  0418 + 5729  have raised a number of questions on our understanding of the sgrs and axps , especially owing to a lack of secular evolution in its spin period . a number of explanations , both within and outside the context of the magnetar model ,",
    "have been proposed to interpret the peculiarity of sgr  0418 + 5729 .",
    "for example , the effects of a stronger toroidal magnetic field below the surface on the neutron star crust was employed to create the observed x - ray bursts independent of strength of the dipole component ( see , e.g. , perna & pons 2011 ; rea et al .   2010 ) .",
    "the existence of a fallback disk has been proposed to evolve the neutron star to its current spin period with a dipole field as low as 10@xmath67  g ( alpar , ertan , & alikan 2010 ; see also ertan et al .",
    "2007 ) .    in this paper , we analyzed the x - ray spectrum of sgr  0418 + 5729  to constrain its surface magnetic field strength , as well as the temperature and the magnetospheric parameters of the neutron star .",
    "we find that the empirical blackbody + power - law model provides a moderate fit , but the emitting area inferred from this fit is unphysically small ( @xmath68  km/2  kpc ) . in addition , contrary to the physical expectations and in contrast to other axp and sgr spectra , the blackbody component dominates over the power - law component in the higher , as opposed to the lower , energy regime",
    ". we also found that realistic atmosphere models of a neutron star with moderate magnetic field strengths ( nsa ) , do not describe the spectrum adequately , yielding @xmath69 .",
    "in contrast , neutron star atmosphere models with magnetar - strength fields ( stems ) produces a fit with @xmath23/ dof @xmath701.18 for 347 degrees of freedom degrees of freedom .",
    "the best fit value of the magnetic field strength is @xmath71  g. thus , the spectral analysis strongly disfavors x - ray models where the magnetic field strength at the surface is assumed to be 10@xmath72 , 10@xmath47 , or 10@xmath48  g.",
    "x - ray observations of a number of other magnetars have been successfully modeled with neutron star atmospheres with high magnetic field strengths , including xte  j1810@xmath17197 ( gver et al .  2007 ) , 4u  0142 + 61 ( gver et al .",

    "the spectroscopically inferred magnetic field strength values for these sources , in units of 10@xmath13 g , are 2.77@xmath730.05 , 4.75@xmath730.03 , 2.26@xmath730.05 , 3.96@xmath74 , 3.1@xmath730.5 , and 5.0@xmath730.48 , respectively . in figure",

    "the spectrally inferred surface magnetic field strength * is * in good agreement with dipole magnetic field estimates , differing at most by a factor of four .",
    "sgr  0418 + 5729  is the first magnetar candidate for which the surface magnetic field strength is significantly larger than the limit on the dipole magnetic field ( @xmath75  15 times larger ) .",
    "it is also interesting that the surface magnetic field strength we report here for sgr  0418 + 5729   is the lowest among other stems measurements for other axps and sgrs so far .        even though the dipole field strengths inferred from spindown involve a number of simplifying assumptions , relaxing them in realistic simulations leads to a factor of two difference in the inferred magnetic field strengths ( contopoulos & spitkovsky 2006 ) .",
    "therefore , the discrepancy between the field strength inferred from the spindown of sgr  0418 + 5729   and the field strength inferred from both its spectrum and its bursts is too large to be accounted for in this way . instead ,",
    "the difference points to a complex magnetic field geometry , i.e , it can be attributed to the presence of higher order multipole components at the surface of the neutron star , which can shape the characteristics of the x - ray emission but do not contribute to the spindown .",
