    "the recent major improvement in the observation of the deep universe , both with hst and ground - based telescopes of the new generation , has greatly increased our chance to probe the cosmological model by venturing to search for primeval galaxies . when observing in the optical or infrared range , however",
    ", we are probing restframe ultraviolet ( uv ) emission of high - redshift objects , and we should therefore rely on confident recognition criteria in this wavelength range in order to pick up distant galaxies and track their evolution back in time .    because of atmosphere opacity , nearby galaxies are still poorly explored in the extreme uv range , and their data can not fully match high-@xmath3 observations ( lanzetta _ et al . _  1996 ; massarotti _ et al . _",
    "2001a ) . in any case , such an empirical approach would neglect evolution , while sample selection and malmquist bias could give rise to a misleading interpretation of the high - redshift data ( buzzoni 1998 , 2001 ; adelberger and steidel 2000 ) .",
    "for all these reasons , galaxy models may prove to be a more effective tool to match primeval galaxy evolution , although within the limits of the established theoretical scenario .",
    "the observation of uv emission of star - forming galaxies at cosmological distances , in the hubble deep field ( williams _ et al . _",
    "1996 ) or in other deep surveys ( lilly _ et al . _  1996",
    "; connolly _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) , has recently led to important advances in the study of the cosmic star formation ( madau _ et al . _  1998",
    "; steidel _ et al . _  1999",
    "; massarotti _ et al . _",
    "2001b ) fueling the current debate on the epoch of galaxy formation . in the light of these results , in this work my aim is to assess in more detail the expected uv properties of primeval galaxies .",
    "in particular , i focus on the theory of uv energetics in stellar populations , in order to explore its dependence on the star formation rate ( sfr ) and other main evolutionary parameters .",
    "this will rely on a previous theoretical framework for evolutionary population synthesis ( buzzoni 1989 , 1995 , 1998 ) .",
    "to some extent , my analysis is complementary to the work of leitherer _ et al . _  ( 1999 ) , as i track here late evolution of star - forming galaxies , when morphology begins to differentiate late- and early - type systems along the hubble sequence .",
    "my discussion will first consider , in sec .  2 , the uv evolution of a simple stellar population ( ssp ) .",
    "this will provide the basic theoretical tools to derive an absolute calibration of galaxy uv luminosity and actual sfr , and to study its possible dependence on metallicity . a possible scheme for the spectral evolution of star - forming galaxies of different morphological type",
    "is outlined in sec .  3 , where i compute a new set of synthesis models and compare , in sec .  4 , the theoretical output with iue observations and other uv data available for local galaxies . the problem of dust absorption is also reviewed in the latter section discussing its possible impact on the evolutionary scenario of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "our relevant conclusions are finally summarized in sec .",
    "contrary to the case of optical and infrared evolution , the ultraviolet luminosity of star - forming galaxies is largely dominated by short - lived stars of high mass ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "this makes population synthesis models much simpler , because hot main sequence ( ms ) stars are the prevailing contributors to the galaxy energetic budget at short wavelengths . in a more refined analysis",
    ", however , the input from low - mass stars ( m  @xmath4  m@xmath2 ) should also be conveniently sized up , since these stars smoothly cumulate over the entire galaxy life and could reach hot temperatures at some stage of the post - ms evolution .",
    "the ssp theory ( renzini and buzzoni 1986 ; buzzoni 1989 ) provides an effective tool to consistently assess the general uv properties of stellar populations . as we will see , the relevant results for the ssp case can also easily apply to the study of star - forming galaxies .",
    "an illustrative summary of the integrated luminosity emitted shortward of 3000   by ms stars of different spectral type is reported in fig .",
    "[ stars ] .",
    "the plot is based on the kurucz ( 1992 ) model atmospheres , adopting a standard temperature - luminosity - mass calibration for class v stars of solar metallicity as from allen ( 1973 ) .",
    "one sees from the figure that at least half the bolometric luminosity of stars more massive than @xmath5  m@xmath2 is spent in the ultraviolet . for stars earlier than @xmath6 ( m  @xmath7  m@xmath2 ) ,",
    "a simple @xmath8-@xmath9 calibration can be derived such as @xmath10 , with @xmath11 for @xmath0     ( expressing both @xmath8 and @xmath9 in solar units ) . at lower mass ,",
    "the slope of the relation quickly steepens , and the uv contribution drops to nominal values for @xmath12 stars .",
    "as far as a ssp is considered , with stars distributed in mass according to a power - law imf such as @xmath13 ( @xmath14 for the salpeter standard case ) , the integrated ms luminosity results : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a normalization factor that scales with the ssp total mass , while m@xmath17 is the lower limit for the imf .",
    "the integral is constrained by the mass of the turn - off ( to ) stars ( m@xmath18 ) , that leave the ms .",
    "this actually marks the `` clock '' of the ssp , giving the time dependence of @xmath19 . recalling that @xmath20 , and provided that @xmath21 and @xmath22 , after some appropriate substitutions we have :",
    "@xmath23 equation  ( [ eq : lms ] ) simply relates total ms luminosity to the to luminosity of the evolving stars in the ssp .    detailed ssp evolution for @xmath0   is computed in fig .",
    "[ uvfrac ] , where i extend to younger ages the original model sequence of buzzoni ( 1989 ) for a salpeter imf and solar metallicity . in this figure , i also single out the contribution from post - agb stars experiencing the planetary nebula event for @xmath24  gyr . as is well known ,",
    "post - agb stars are important contributors to short - wavelength luminosity in old ssps , and may actually constrain the ultraviolet properties of present - day elliptical galaxies ( renzini and buzzoni 1986 ; burstein _ et al . _  1988 ;",
    "greggio and renzini 1990 ; yi _ et al . _  1999 ) .",
    "the ssp model of fig .",
    "[ uvfrac ] assumes a red horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology ; my choice relies on the fact that hb evolution quickly turns to redder colors with increasing star mass and/or metallicity .",
    "although stars with temperatures in excess of 10000  k are recognized in some old metal - poor galactic globular clusters ( cacciari _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) , a red hb is always to be expected at younger ages ( i.e.  for @xmath25  gyr ; cf .  fig .  4 of buzzoni 1989 ) .    the resulting ssp luminosity evolution at three reference wavelength values , namely , 1600 , 2000 , and 2800  , is reported in table  [ ssp ] for a salpeter imf with an upper cutoff mass of 120  m@xmath2 .",
    "insofar as ms contribution is the prevailing one in the uv energetic budget , the ssp luminosity evolution can be approximated by a simple analitical relation linking eq .",
    "( [ eq : lms ] ) with the theoretical stellar clock .",
    "the ms lifetime for stars in the different range of mass and solar metallicity can be evaluated from a number of sets of theoretical models .",
    "i considered the work of becker ( 1981 ) , vandenberg ( 1985 ) , castellani _ et al . _",
    "( 1990 ) , lattanzio ( 1991 ) , schaller _",
    "et al . _  ( 1992 ) , and bressan _ et al . _  ( 1993 ) . a useful fit to these data , which spans the whole range of mass , is @xmath26 ( cf .",
    "[ clock ] ) .    by differentiating eq .",
    "( [ eq : lms ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit_clock ] ) we obtain @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "assuming that @xmath29 , this leads to @xmath30 the power index @xmath31 depends on @xmath32 and @xmath33 , so that it slightly changes with time and wavelength ( ssp luminosity fades more rapidly at shorter wavelength ) but , as a general case , we could verify from table  [ ssp ] that @xmath34 for @xmath0   .",
    "this feature has important consequences when linking uv luminosity and galaxy sfr . in the case of a star - forming galaxy with constant sfr , for example",
    ", actual luminosity simply follows as @xmath35\\ l_{tmin}^{ssp } \\label{eq : lgal}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the age of the system , and @xmath37 is the lifetime of the most massive stars in the imf .",
    "the previous equation confirms that galaxy uv luminosity eventually does not depend on age , but only on its actual sfr ( kennicutt 1998 , cf .",
    "his fig .  2 ) .",
    "as a consequence , a _ minimum _",

    "( [ eq : lmin ] ) , the intrinsic @xmath123 distribution implies a sfr dispersion of over a factor of two among galaxies of the same morphological type .",

    "a lower uv emission can be achieved either by decreasing the imf upper cutoff or with a steeper imf slope ( that is assuming a dwarf - dominated stellar population ) ; alternatively , we should call for a systematically lower stellar birthrate in the galaxies . in any case , the required change both in the imf slope and in the current sfr would also lead to an exceedingly redder @xmath85 ( buzzoni 1989 ) , while a lower value for m@xmath136 could better match the data by selectively reducing the 2000   emission alone , as shown in fig .",
    "[ donas1 ] .    a further and possibly crucial issue in this regard , however ,",
    "is the galaxy internal extinction ; the presence of dust would in fact act in the sense of a systematic bias toward redder uv colors . according to the calzetti ( 1999 ) attenuation law , we obtain a color vector @xmath137 , so that a typical ( internal ) color excess @xmath138  mag could fairly account for the observations .      our models for galaxy spectral evolution do not explicitly include dust absorption .",
    "its effect on galaxy sed is in the sense of suppressing uv emission and enhancing infrared luminosity , as a consequence of the thermalization process .",
    "in addition to stellar extinction , when considering external galaxies we should also account for the contribution of grain scattering , as well as the geometry of dust distribution and its partition between diffuse and `` clumpy '' phases . while scattering",
    "could sensibly alleviate the uv extinction ( bruzual _ et al . _  1988",

    "[ rifatto ] that galaxy distribution always peaks , on average , at flatter uv slopes ( i.e.  @xmath151 ) compared to our theoretical lower limit ; this indicates that some intervening absorption is systematically affecting the observations , with starburst and later - type galaxies ( type sd / im ) marginally more obscured with respect to sa / sb systems .",

    "generally speaking , a large fraction of residual gas , such as in primeval galaxies , should call for a _ low _ amount of dust .",
    "the latter is in fact a natural output of stellar evolution ( mass loss and supernova events actually supply the basic ingredients for grain formation ) , and should therefore _ follow _ star formation not _ precede _ it . as a matter of fact , however , young starbursters certainly appear to be more dust - rich than old quiescent ellipticals ( calzetti _ et al . _  1994 ) .",
    "the association of greater quantities of dust with strongly star - forming galaxies may perhaps be due to a shorter timescale for dust than for star formation , or more likely to a feedback process , by which starbursts preferentially occur in dense gas / molecular clouds already heavily contaminated by dust .",
    "both these arguments point to a tight relationship between dust absorption ( and its induced ir emission ) and galaxy uv luminosity , as found by meurer _",
    "et al . _  ( 1999 ) ; apparently , this correlation is already in place at high redshift , as demonstrated by adelberger and steidel ( 2000 ) .",
    "a dominant contribution of the uv - selected galaxy population to the ir cosmic background is also in line with the results of massarotti _ et al . _",
    "( 2001b ) , who fully reconcile the scuba estimates for sfr density at high @xmath3 ( barger _ et al . _",
    "2001 ) with the hubble deep field optical observations .",
    "an important point that one should bear in mind , however , is that dust comes from cumulative processes inside galaxies , and its content should generally increase with time ; contrary to the observations , this would predict more heavily obscured systems at present time . in order to break this apparent dichotomy",
    "we need to `` split '' , at some point of galaxy evolution , the distribution of the luminous matter ( i.e.  stars ) and dust . the case of our own galaxy might be explanatory in this sense .    because of a higher velocity dispersion and supernova shock waves , young o - b associations leave parent molecular clouds and spread their b stars across the disk on a timescale of some @xmath1 yrs , a value comparable to the lifetime of stars of 5 - 10  m@xmath2 ( see , in this regard , the classical work of becker and fenkart 1963 , or the recent contribution of hoogerwerf _ et al . _",
    "if this is the case also for external galaxies , then an increasing fraction of luminous matter would quickly escape the regions of harder and `` clumpy '' dust absorption ( _  la _ calzetti 1999 ) moving towards a milder and `` scattered '' dust environment ( _  la _ bruzual _ et al . _",

    "as expected , the galaxy uv luminosity below 3000    is largely dominated by the high - mass stellar component , and the distinctive properties of the integrated sed are nearly independent of both the total mass of the galaxy and its past star formation history . at every age , this leads to a direct relationship between galaxy uv luminosity and actual sfr ( cf .",
    ".  [ eq : lmin ] and fig .  [ calib ] ) .",
    "due to a faster evolution of the bulge stellar population ( basically a ssp with @xmath158 and @xmath34 ) , the high - redshift ancestors of present - day spirals should appear as sharply nucleated objects displaying scarce or no morphological structure .",
    "in addition , early galaxy evolution ( @xmath159 gyr ) could also display some color `` degeneracy '' in the uv range ( cf .",
    "[ lh ] ) loosing any clear relationship between photometric properties and galaxy morphology along the hubble sequence .",
    "this effect should not be neglected for its possible importance in a fair sampling of the galaxy population at high redshift ( buzzoni 1998 ) .",
    "the claimed role of late - type systems as prevailing contributors to the cosmic uv background is reinforced by our results ; at 2000   i m irregulars are found in fact nearly four orders of magnitude brighter than ellipticals , per unit luminous mass ( cf .",
    "[ ml ] ) .",
    "the uv wavelength range is especially sensitive to dust absorption ; this problem should be properly assessed in high - redshift studies .",
    "the sed of local starburst and late - type galaxies shows clear evidence of some intrinsic reddening systematically affecting galaxies in their active star - forming stage .",
    "the amount of luminosity extinction for these objects sensibly depends on the assumed dust environment and grain properties , but it may be as high as 2 mag at 1600   in the most typical cases .",
    "dust is expected to cumulate along the galaxy lifetime , so that the @xmath160 ratio should increase more than linearly with time for both spirals and ellipticals .",
    "however , the apparent lack of strong reddening in old quiescent systems at present time indicates that even in the uv range most of the luminous contribution comes from relatively unabsorbed stars .",

    "<S> the ultraviolet luminosity evolution of star - forming galaxies is explored from the theoretical point of view , especially focusing on the theory of uv energetics in simple and composite stellar populations and its relationship to the star formation rate and other main evolutionary parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> galaxy emission below @xmath0    directly correlates with actual star formation , not depending on the total mass of the system . </S>",
    "<S> a straightforward calibration is obtained , in this sense , from the theoretical models at 1600 , 2000 and 2800  , and a full comparison is carried out with iue data and other balloon - borne observations for local galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> the claimed role of late - type systems as prevailing contributors to the cosmic uv background is reinforced by our results ; at 2000   i m irregulars are found in fact nearly four orders of magnitude brighter than ellipticals , per unit luminous mass .    </S>",
    "<S> the role of dust absorption in the observation of high - redshift galaxies is assessed , comparing model output and observed spectral energy distribution of local galaxy samples . </S>",
    "<S> similar to what we observe in our own galaxy , a quick evolution in the dust environment might be envisaged in primeval galaxies , with an increasing fraction of luminous matter that would escape the regions of harder and `` clumpy '' dust absorption on a timescale of some @xmath1  yr , comparable with the lifetime of stars of 510  m@xmath2 . </S>"
