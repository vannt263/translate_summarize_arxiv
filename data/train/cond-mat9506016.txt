    "about 30 years ago considerable interest has been devoted to the properties of generalized cosserat elasticity .",
    "one of the main activities was the formulation of continuum theories reproducing lattice dispersion relationships to a certain extent@xcite .",
    "these approaches ( gradient theories ) were designed in order to incorporate certain atomistic aspects into generalized elastic continua .",
    "however , it was early recognized that such theories were in principle also applicable to the description of micro structural and dislocation phenomena@xcite . recently a first order ( strain ) gradient theory was applied to a fracture mechanical problem obtaining results reminiscent of barrenblatt s cohesion theory@xcite .",
    "however , the gradient elasticity approach leads to , in general , formidable mathematical difficulties , to a somewhat suspect choice of additional boundary conditions , and to numerous physically not well understood new material constants .",
    "these difficulties are circumvented in discrete fracture models which have been adopted during the past decade in order to study the effect of structural heterogeneities and fluctuations on fracture growth processes under various physical conditions . using triangular networks of springs stretched on the outer boundary into the six directions of a hexagon",
    "the breaking of a material from a central hole has been investigated by several authors @xcite . employing disordered beam networks , the scaling of micro crack densities @xcite and",
    "the growth of cracks due to an inner hydraulic pressure @xcite have been studied in some detail .",
    "these investigations offer a new methodological approach to study failure processes in heterogeneous brittle materials on a mesoscopic length scale close to experimental situations @xcite .",
    "our interest is focused on brittle materials because their rheological behavior can be regarded most simple as they do not show any remanent ( plastic ) deformations@xcite .",
    "one difficulty arising during the examination of numerically observed results often consists in finding appropriate scaling variables . as we will see below this",
    "is not a trivial task , not even for perfect straight cracks .",
    "we focus on finite - size scaling because the employed lattice sizes @xmath0 are always finite one is , however , mostly interested in properties of very large or infinite systems .",
    "thus the finite - size scaling approach appears to be the only conclusive numerical method to verify ( conjectured ) asymptotic behavior for @xmath1 .    in the present paper",
    "we will show that the micro structure ( lattice structure ) can change both asymptotic and finite - size scaling of the breaking characteristics , depending on the employed boundary conditions .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we briefly outline the fracture model , the employed boundary conditions and how to determine the external breaking stresses and pressures . following this we present in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] the main finite - size scaling results for breaking stresses and pressures of linear cracks on two - dimensional beam lattices .",
    "we compare our findings with known analytical continuum results .    for crack growth scaling properties in disordered materials the reader",
    "is referred to ref .",
    "[ b3 - 2 ] .",
    "we investigate both the case of uniaxial loading due to remote tensile forces and the loading due to a hydrostatic pressure acting from the interior on the crack surface .",
    "the former situation is typically encountered when a material is pulled at its outer faces , while the latter one can be found in engineering applications of hydraulic fracturing@xcite .",
    "we consider the beam model on a two dimensional square lattice of linear size @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "each of the lattice sites @xmath2 carries three real variables : the two translational displacements @xmath3 and @xmath4 and a rotational angle @xmath5 .",
    "neighboring sites are rigidly connected by elastic beams of length @xmath6 .",
    "the beams all have the same cross section and the same elastic behavior , governed by three material dependent constants @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the young and shear moduli , @xmath12 the cross section of the beam and @xmath13 the moment of inertia for flexion .",
    "we used for all simulations the values @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "when a site is rotated ( @xmath17 ) the beams bend accordingly always forming tangentially right angles with each other . in this way",
    "local momenta are taken into account . for a horizontal beam between sites",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath18 one has the longitudinal force acting at site @xmath18 : @xmath19 ; the shear force : @xmath20 , and the flexural torque at site @xmath18 : @xmath21 , using @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "corresponding equations hold for the vertical beams . the hydrostatic stress acting on a beam",
    "is given by its longitudinal force per beam cross section , @xmath25 .",
    "in mechanical equilibrium the sum over all internal and external forces ( torques ) acting on site @xmath18 must vanish .",
    "we will neglect inertial forces , assuming a sufficiently slow fracture process .",
    "the cohesive properties of the beams are considered to be homogeneous , i.e.the beams behave linear - elastic up to their theoretical strength @xmath26 ( cohesion force ) , above which they irreversibly break ( zero elastic constants ) . at the beginning of each simulation",
    "we break one vertical beam located at the center of the lattice .",
    "this is the initial crack .",
    "corresponding to the employed boundary conditions described below we calculate the internal force distribution @xmath27 of beams connecting sites @xmath2 and @xmath18 using a conjugate gradient method@xcite . from this longitudinal forces",
    "we determine and break the most over stressed beam , i.e. the beam carrying the highest force , @xmath28 .",
    "the maximum force allows us to calculate a scaling factor @xmath29 which in turn is used to determine the macroscopic breaking stress @xmath30 or breaking pressure @xmath31 ( measured in units of @xmath32 ) necessary to fulfill the local fracture criterion @xmath33 .",
    "such scaling is possible due to the linearity of the employed elastic equations . breaking the beam connecting sites @xmath34 and @xmath35 destroys the balance of forces at those sites and one has to relax the system to its new equilibrium configuration",
    ". then the above steps are repeated until the lattice breaks apart .",
    "it is well known that the highest stress enhancement factors occur at the crack tips for the pressure as well as for the tensile problem . because we consider only homogeneous cohesion forces the terms ` most over stressed ' and ` highest stress ' are equivalent and the cracks grow linear in direction of the highest local tensile force . in our case",
    "the direction of crack growth is the x - direction because of the uniaxiality of imposed boundary conditions , see below .      to impose an external strain we attach at the bottom of the lattice a zeroth line on which for all sites @xmath36 are fixed , and on the top we attach a @xmath37st line on which all sites have the same fixed values @xmath38 and @xmath39 . with this boundary conditions the external displacement in y - direction",
    "is fixed to unity ( dirichlet boundary conditions ) and one can imagine them as being represented by rigid bars attached at the top and the bottom of the lattice@xcite . for the boundary conditions in x - direction we consider periodic as well as free lattice boundaries . the externally applied stress , @xmath40 , necessary to maintain a unity displacement between the two rigid bars can be easily calculated by summing up all @xmath4 displacements over the first line , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the longitudinal force constant , @xmath12 the cross section of the beam and @xmath0 the ( dimensionless ) lattice size . employing the above defined scaling factor @xmath43 we express",
    "the externally applied breaking stress , @xmath30 , in the form , @xmath44 or in dimensionless form , @xmath45 with this notation the external breaking stress @xmath30 is just the stress necessary to yield the local breaking condition @xmath33 .",
    "we will use eq.([eq : tensile - stress ] ) for our finite - size scaling purposes .",
    "it expresses the breaking stress , measured in units of cohesion stress , in terms of the beam force @xmath46 at the ` crack tip ' and the average force @xmath47 on a beam due to the global unit displacement . in general",
    "both terms depend on the number of broken beams @xmath48 ( crack size ) and on the lattice size @xmath0 , see sec .  [ sec : results - tensile ] .",
    "experimentally hydraulic fracturing is encountered when an incompressible fluid is injected under high pressure into an existing crack .",
    "the characteristics of this particular loading mode is that the loading of the crack only happens on the crack surface itself , but not on remote surfaces like in the case of tensile fracturing .",
    "recently hydraulic fracturing has been numerically addressed by introducing for each broken beam a force dipole of strength @xmath49 simulating an inner pressure @xmath50@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will follow this implementation . starting from one vertical broken beam ( zero elastic constants , one vertical force dipole ) we calculate the internal stress distribution @xmath27 using the conjugate gradient . calculating the scaling factor @xmath43",
    "as described above we determine and break the beam carrying the highest stress , @xmath46 .",
    "thereafter the lattice has to be relaxed again ( now two broken beams , two force dipoles ) and one repeats the above mentioned steps until the lattice breaks apart .    we have performed calculations for free external boundaries in x- and y - direction as well as for periodic boundaries in x - direction and free boundaries in y - direction . as we only impose stresses the elastic solution ( displacement field ) is unique up to a general translation and rotation . without restriction",
    "we therefore fix the displacement of an arbitrary lattice site to zero .",
    "analogous to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tensile])and ( [ eq : tensile - stress ] ) one has for the breaking pressure ,    @xmath51    and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath32 is the tensile strength and not the compressional strength .",
    "in fact the stresses at the tips are tensile stresses as the crack is hydraulically opened",
    ".    we will use eq .",
    "( [ eq : pressure - stress ] ) for the finite - size scaling of the hydraulic problem .",
    "as explained in sec .  [ sec : model ] we obtain from our simulations the macroscopic breaking stresses and pressures , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , measured in units of the theoretical strength @xmath32 , in terms of the number of broken beams @xmath48 and the employed lattice sizes @xmath0 .",
    "as we are interested in the finite - size scaling properties of the breaking stresses ( @xmath55 ) and pressures ( @xmath56 ) we introduce two new functions , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , @xmath59    the function @xmath58 describes the finite - size corrections to the scaling @xmath57 between the breaking stress / pressure and the crack length for given boundary conditions in the infinite system .",
    "the quantity @xmath60 is for our purposes the most suitable scaling variable as it represents the length of a linear crack measured in units of the employed lattice size . in general both functions ,",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 will depend on the employed boundary conditions . in order to show numerically that the finite - size scaling function @xmath58 exists , one needs to know ( or to conjecture ) the explicit form of @xmath57 , i.e. the asymptotic behavior of @xmath63 as @xmath1 .",
    "we will access the latter information from simple continuum mechanical considerations of symmetric elasticity .",
    "previous continuum mechanical scaling considerations have successfully been applied to fracture models .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the breaking stress @xmath30 for tensile fracturing of a finite , periodic beam lattice follows very well the known ` tangent - formula ' of fracture mechanics @xcite , @xmath64 by comparison with eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling - general ] ) we see that the asymptotic scaling for the breaking stress @xmath30 is given by @xmath65 , a result that originally was found by griffith . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tension - scaling ] we show the finite - size scalings for the numerically obtained tensile breaking stresses ( a ) for free boundary conditions and ( b ) for periodic boundary conditions . for both curves",
    "the data collapse is quite acceptable . while for the periodic problem the finite - size correction @xmath58 follows eq .",
    "( [ eq : tangent - formula])@xcite , no analytical expression for @xmath62 is known in the case of free boundary conditions .",
    "however , the differences for the breaking stresses at given values of @xmath60 are less than @xmath66 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : tension - scaling ] , and eq .  ( [ eq : tangent - formula ] ) represents a reasonably good approximation for finite solids for many practical purposes .      in general analytical solutions of crack problems",
    "are difficult to obtain and even for two - dimensional problems in infinite , semi - infinite or periodic domains one is often faced with complicated integral equations .",
    "the reader interested in this is referred to muskhelishvili@xcite and sneddon@xcite .",
    "it has been shown analytically that the breaking pressure @xmath31 of a semi - infinite two - dimensional continuum with periodic boundary conditions is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tangent - formula ] ) where one has to replace @xmath30 by @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure - wrong - scaling ] the analogous plot to fig .",
    "[ fig : tension - scaling ] for the breaking pressure .",
    "one does not obtain a data collapse , indicating that @xmath65 , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : scaling - general ] ) and ( [ eq : tangent - formula ] ) , is _ not _ the scaling of the breaking pressure in the asymptotic limit of infinite lattices .",
    "this result is somewhat unexpected , because the continuum limit predicts identical scaling relations for breaking stresses and pressures and on the other hand we find good agreement between lattice and continuum scalings for the tensile problem .",
    "however , the proposed model for hydraulic fracturing is defined on a lattice and not in a continuum .",
    "as lattices always show additional structure , higher order gradient terms of the continuum displacement field appear in the elastic solution , which have no counterparts in simple continua@xcite .    in the following",
    "we present an argument why the lattice finite - size scalings for the pressure and tensile problem are different .    in the tensile problem the loading forces are acting at the lattice boundaries _ remote _ to the stress free crack surfaces .",
    "therefore local stresses close to the crack tips are carried through nearly the whole elastic volume .",
    "contrary to this in the hydraulic problem loading only happens due to force dipoles acting at the crack surfaces _ close _ to the crack tips .",
    "one therefore might expect that the breaking pressures @xmath31 show a more pronounced ` ( micro structure ) lattice behavior ' than the breaking stresses @xmath30 .",
    "for very large cracks these differences should diminish as the discrete loading approaches a force density .    in order to extent a linear crack of length @xmath48 in an infinite continuum one has to impose a breaking pressure @xmath67 .",
    "however , employing a _ single double force _ of magnitude @xmath68 one finds , @xmath69 for the critical loading force ( related boussinesq problem)@xcite .",
    "we argue now that for a single crack in an infinite disk loaded by equidistant force dipoles the asymptotic scaling for @xmath61 is equivalent to that of an infinite lattice .",
    "knowing @xmath61 we plot the finite - size scalings for the investigated lattices .",
    "the asymptotic continuum scaling for the breaking pressure ( as calculated from equidistant force dipoles ) is most easily obtained using the complex stress function of westergaard@xcite .",
    "we find for the asymptotic scaling in an infinite disk , @xmath70 with @xmath71 the sum @xmath72 converges rapidly towards @xmath73 and for large @xmath48 towards @xmath74 .",
    "hence in the limit of a large number of force dipoles we obtain the aforementioned asymptotic griffith scaling for the breaking pressure , @xmath75 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure - scaling ] we show the resulting finite - size scalings for the breaking pressure , based on eqs .",
    "( [ eq : scaling - general ] ) and ( [ eq : improved - scaling ] ) . in this plot a reasonable scaling is obtained , which proves our earlier statement that the asymptotic limits ( @xmath1 ) of the breaking pressures for continua and lattices are different . comparing fig .  [",
    "fig : pressure - scaling ] with fig .",
    "[ fig : tension - scaling ] one also notes a significant deviation from the scaling form eq .",
    "( [ eq : tangent - formula ] ) , demonstrating a modified correction to scaling behavior .",
    "we have presented finite - size scaling results for breaking stresses ( tensile fracturing ) and breaking pressures ( hydraulic fracturing ) of elastically and cohesively homogeneous beam lattices in two dimensions ( plane stress condition ) . for the tensile problem",
    "it has been shown that both the asymptotic lattice scaling @xmath57 as well as the finite - size lattice scaling @xmath58 are well represented by the known continuum scaling form ( ` tangent - formula ' ) .",
    "in contrast the hydraulic fracture problem formulated on a lattice , has lead us to different asymptotic and finite - size lattice scalings , though the corresponding continuum scalings for breaking pressures and stresses are identical .",
    "explicitly we constructed the asymptotic lattice scaling of breaking pressures from purely continuum mechanical considerations , by taking into account the discrete nature of the loading .",
    "as the overwhelming number of brittle materials is granular in character , the interesting question arises whether their breaking characteristics can be satisfactory described by continuum models regardless of employed loading conditions .",
