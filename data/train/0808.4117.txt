    "dust is the cornerstone of the unification theory of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "this theory proposes that all agns are essentially `` born equal '' : all types of agns are surrounded by an optically thick dust torus and are basically the same object but viewed from different lines of sight ( see e.g. antonucci 1993 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) . the large diversity in the observational properties of agns (",
    "e.g. optical emission - line widths and x - ray spectral slopes ) is simply caused by the viewing - angle - dependent obscuration of the nucleus : those viewed face - on are unobscured ( allowing for a direct view of their nuclei ) and recognized as `` type 1 '' agns , while those viewed edge - on are `` type 2 '' agns with most of their central engine and broad line regions being hidden by the obscuring dust .    apparently , key factors in understanding the structure and nature of agns are determining the geometry of the nuclear obscuring torus around the central engine and the obscuration ( i.e. extinction , a combination of absorption and scattering ) properties of the circumnuclear dust . an accurate knowledge of the dust extinction properties is also required to correct for the dust obscuration in order to recover the intrinsic optical / ultraviolet ( uv ) spectrum of the nucleus from the observed spectrum and to probe the physical conditions of the dust - enshrouded gas close to the nucleus .",
    "the presence of an obscuring dust torus around the central engine was first indirectly indicated by the spectropolarimetric detection of broad permitted emission lines ( characteristic of type 1 agns ) scattered into our line of sight by free electrons located above or below the dust torus in a number of type 2 agns ( e.g. see heisler et al .",
    "1997 , tran 2003 ) . direct evidence for the presence of a dust torus is provided by infrared ( ir ) observations .",
    "the circumnuclear dust absorbs the agn illumination and reradiates the absorbed energy in the ir .",
    "the ir emission at wavelengths longward of @xmath0@xmath11@xmath2 accounts for at least 50% of the bolometric luminosity of type 2 agns . for type 1 agns , @xmath310% of the bolometric luminosity",
    "is emitted in the ir ( e.g. see fig.13.7 of osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) .",
    "a near - ir `` bump '' ( excess emission above the @xmath3210@xmath2 continuum ) , generally attributed to hot dust with temperatures around @xmath312001500@xmath4 ( near the sublimation temperatures of silicate and graphite grains ) , is seen in a few type 1 agns ( barvainis 1987 ; rodrguez - ardila & mazzalay 2006 ) .",
    "direct imaging at near- and mid - ir wavelengths has been performed for several agns and provides constraints on the size and structure of the circumnuclear dust torus ( e.g. see jaffe et al .",
    "2004 , elitzur 2006 ) .",
    "spectroscopically , the 10@xmath2 silicate _ absorption",
    "_ feature ( see  3.3 ) and the 3.4@xmath2 aliphatic hydrocarbon _ absorption _ feature ( see  3.2 ) are widely seen in heavily obscured type 2 agns ; in contrast , the 10@xmath2 silicate _ emission _",
    "feature has recently been detected in a number of type 1 agns ( see  3.3 ) .    to properly interpret the observed ir continuum emission and spectroscopy as well as the ir images of agns",
    ", it requires a good understanding of the absorption and emission properties of the circumnuclear dust . to this end",
    ", one needs to know the composition , size , and morphology of the dust  with this knowledge , one can use mie theory ( for spherical dust ) to calculate the absorption and scattering cross sections of the dust from x - ray to far - ir wavelengths , and then calculate its uv / optical / near - ir obscuration as a function of wavelength , and derive the dust thermal equilibrium temperature ( based on the energy balance between absorption and emission ) as well as its ir emission spectrum .",
    "this will allow us to correct for dust obscuration and constrain the circumnuclear structure through modeling the observed ir emission and images .",
    "the former is essential for interpreting the obscured uv / optical emission lines and probing the physical conditions of the central regions ; the latter is critical to our understanding of the growth of the central supermassive black hole .",
    "however , little is known about the dust in the circumnuclear torus of agns .",
    "even our knowledge of the best - studied dust  the milky way interstellar dust  is very limited . in this review",
    ", i will take a comparative study of the extinction and ir emission as well as the uv / ir spectroscopic properties and the inferred composition , size and morphology of the dust in agns and the dust in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the milky way and other galaxies .",
    "extinction is a combined effect of absorption and scattering .",
    "since a grain absorbs and scatters light most effectively at wavelengths comparable to its size @xmath0@xmath5@xmath6 , the wavelength dependence of extinction ( `` extinction curve '' ) constrains the dust size distribution .",
    "interstellar extinction is most commonly obtained through the `` pair - method '' by comparing the spectra of two stars of the same spectral type , one of which is reddened and the other unreddened .",
    "interstellar extinction curves rise from the near - ir to the near - uv , with a broad absorption feature at about @xmath7@xmath54.6@xmath8 ( @xmath0@xmath52175@xmath9 ) , followed by a steep rise into the far - uv @xmath7@xmath510@xmath8 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this wavelength dependence indicates that there must exist in the ism a population of large grains with @xmath10@xmath11@xmath12@xmath5@xmath13 to account for the extinction at visible / near - ir wavelengths , and a population of ultrasmall grains with @xmath10@xmath14@xmath12@xmath5 + @xmath15 to account for the far - uv extinction at @xmath0=@xmath13 . in the wavelength range of 0.125@xmath16@xmath0@xmath163.5@xmath2",
    ", the galactic extinction curves can be approximated by an analytical formula involving only one free parameter : @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 , the total - to - selective extinction ratio ( cardelli et al .",
    "1989 ) , with @xmath17@xmath53.1 for the galactic average ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the optical / uv extinction curves and @xmath17 show considerable regional variations and depend on the environment : lower - density regions have a smaller @xmath17 , a stronger 2175@xmath9 bump and a steeper far - uv rise ( @xmath7@xmath14@xmath8 ) , implying smaller dust in these regions ; denser regions have a larger @xmath17 , a weaker 2175@xmath9 bump and a flatter far - uv rise , implying larger dust .",
    "in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , the extinction curves of most sightlines display a nearly linear steep rise with @xmath7 and an extremely weak or absent 2175@xmath9 bump ( lequeux et al .",
    "1982 ; prvot et al .",
    "1984 ; see fig.2 ) , suggesting that the dust in the smc is smaller than that in the galactic diffuse ism as a result of either more efficient dust destruction in the smc due to its harsh environment of the copious star formation associated with the smc bar or lack of growth due to the low - metallicity of the smc , or both .",
    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) extinction curve is characterized by a weaker 2175@xmath9 bump and a stronger far - uv rise than the galactic curve ( nandy et al .",
    "1981 ; koornneef & code 1981 ) , intermediate between that of the smc and that of the galaxy ( see fig.2 ) . regional variations also exist in the smc and lmc extinction curves .",
    "little is known about the wavelength dependence of the extinction caused by the circumnuclear dust of agns . in literature , the agn extinction curves are mainly inferred from ( 1 ) composite quasar spectra , and ( 2 ) individual reddened agns .",
    "the former often reveals a `` gray '' extinction , implying that the size distribution of the dust in the agn circumnuclear environments is skewed towards substantially large grains .",
    "the latter often suggests a steep - rising smc - like extinction , indicating a preponderance of small grains near the nucleus .",
    "there is also indirect information , including the dust reddening- and extinction - to - gas ratios and the ir emission modeling of agns ( see  4 ) .",
    "czerny et al .  ( 2004 ) constructed a quasar extinction curve based on the blue and red composite quasar spectra of richards et al .",
    "( 2003 ) obtained from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "six composite quasar spectra were generated by richards et al .",
    "( 2003 ) from 4576 sdss quasars based on the relative g@xmath20i@xmath20 color with `` composite 1 '' ( made from 770 objects ) being the bluest .",
    "czerny et al .  ( 2004 ) created a mean `` quasar extinction curve '' by averaging 3 extinction curves obtained through comparing the spectra of composites 3 , 4 , and 5 ( consisting of 770 , 770 , and 211 objects , respectively ) with that of composite 1 , assuming that composite 1 is essentially unaffected by dust while composites 3 , 4 , and 5 are subject to dust reddening .",
    "the resulting extinction curve is nearly monotonic with wavelength , without any trace of the 2175@xmath9 bump ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "gaskell et al .",
    "( 2004 ) derived extinction curves for radio - loud quasars based on the composite spectra of 72 radio quasars created by baker & hunstead ( 1995 ) , and for radio - quiet agns based on the composite spectrum of 1018 radio - quiet agns generated by francis et al .",
    "the extinction curve for these radio - loud quasars , grouped by baker & hunstead ( 1995 ) into 4 subsamples according to the 5ghz radio core - to - lobe flux ratios @xmath21 , was determined by comparing the composite spectrum of the more - reddened lobe - dominant ( @xmath21@xmath220.1 ) sample with that of less - reddened core - dominant ( @xmath21@xmath11 ) sample .",
    "similarly , gaskell et al .",

    "( 1991 ) created for 1018 radio - quiet agns with that for the relatively unreddened core - dominant composite of baker & hunstead ( 1995 ) .",
    "most prominently , the derived extinction curves for both radio - loud quasars and radio - quiet quasarssy lack the 2175@xmath9 bump and are essentially `` gray '' , i.e. , significantly flatter in the uv than that of the milky way diffuse ism , although it appears that for the latter the reddening curve is slightly steeper in the uv ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "however , willott ( 2005 ) questioned the validity of the approach based on the ratios of reddened and unreddened composite quasars ( czerny et al .",
    "2004 ; gaskell et al .",
    "2004 ) since composite spectra combine quasars at different redshifts , while the quasars going into a composite spectrum have a negative correlation between reddening and redshift , and quasar surveys in practice contain more highly reddened quasars at lower redshifts .",
    "he argued that since the quasars contributing to the composite in the uv have typically lower reddening than those contributing in the optical , the gray uv extinction laws derived using composite quasars ( czerny et al .",
    "2004 ; gaskell et al .",
    "2004 ) might be artificial , and the actual agn extinction curve may be smc - like .",
    "in contrast to the `` composite quasar spectrum '' method which may be biased by the fact that the highest redshift quasars ( which contribute to the uv part of a composite spectrum ) are less extincted ( leading to shallower extinction in the uv ) , agn extinction curves have also been derived for individual reddened objects .",
    "crenshaw et al .  ( 2001 ) determined a reddening curve for the nucleus of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc3227 by comparing its hst / stis uv and optical spectra with that of the unreddened seyfert galaxy ngc4151 .",
    "they found that the derived extinction curve in the uv is even steeper than that of the smc and lacks the 2175@xmath9 bump .",
    "similar studies were performed for ark564 , a narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2002 ) . by comparing the hst / stis uv and optical spectra of ark564 with that of mrk493 , an unreddened narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy , crenshaw et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that the extinction curve for ark564 , with no evidence for the 2175@xmath9 bump , rises to the uv more steeply than the galactic extinction curve ( but not as steeply as the smc curve ) with a longer turning - up wavelength of @xmath34000@xmath9 ( compared to @xmath32500@xmath9 for the standard galactic , lmc , and smc curves ) .    in an analysis of the optical / uv color distribution of 4576 sdss quasars , richards et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed that 273 ( 6.0% ) of the quasars in their sample appear to be redder because of smc - like dust extinction and reddening .",
    "hopkins et al .",
    "( 2004 ) investigated the reddening law toward 9566 sdss quasars , including a subset of 1886 quasars matched to 2mass ( two micron all sky survey ) by exploring the shapes of their spectral energy distributions obtained from broadband photometry ( at five sdss bands @xmath23 and three 2mass bands @xmath24 ) .",
    "they found that the reddening toward quasars is dominated by smc - like dust at the quasar redshift .",

    "( 2001b ) ascribed the reduced @xmath27 and @xmath30 ratios of agns ( often with a solar or higher metallicity ) to grain growth through coagulation in the dense circumnuclear region which results in a dust size distribution biased in favour of large grains and therefore a flat extinction curve .",
    "however , weingartner & murray ( 2002 ) argued that the x - ray absorption and optical extinction may occur in distinct media ( e.g. the x - ray absorption occurs in material located off the torus and/or accretion disk , while the optical extinction occurs in material located beyond the torus ) ; therefore , the reduced @xmath27 and @xmath30 ratios may not necessarily imply that the grains in agns are systematically larger than those in the galactic ism .",
    "dust spectroscopy provides the most diagnostic information on the dust composition .",

    "2001b ) .",
    "the exact nature of the 2175@xmath9 bump , the strongest spectroscopic extinction feature in the galactic ism , remains uncertain .",
    "it is generally believed to be caused by aromatic carbonaceous ( graphitic ) materials , very likely a cosmic mixture of pah molecules ( joblin et al .",
    "1992 ; li & draine 2001b ) . the fact that the 2175@xmath9 bump is not ( or at least rarely ) seen in agns suggests that its carrier ( e.g. pahs ) may have been photodestroyed by energetic photons ( e.g. x - ray irradiation ) from the central engine .",

    "grains in dark molecular clouds ( usually with @xmath36@xmath13@xmath47 ) obtain ice mantles consisting of h@xmath32o , nh@xmath33 , co , ch@xmath33oh , co@xmath32 , ch@xmath34 , h@xmath32co and other molecules ( with h@xmath32o as the dominant species ) , as revealed by the detection of various ice absorption features ( e.g. , h@xmath32o : 3.1 , 6.0@xmath37 ; co : 4.67@xmath37 ; co@xmath32 : 4.27 , 15.2@xmath37 ; ch@xmath33oh : 3.54 , 9.75@xmath37 ; nh@xmath33 : 2.97@xmath37 ; ch@xmath34 : 7.68@xmath37 ; h@xmath32co : 5.81@xmath37 ; xcn@xmath35 : 4.62@xmath37 ) .",
    "the ice absorption features are also seen in most ulirgs ( e.g. see spoon et al .  2002 ) , indicating the presence of a large quantity of molecular material in ulirgs .",
    "however , the ice absorption features are not expected in agns due to the high dust temperatures ( because of the immense bolometric luminosity emitted from the agn )  the dust in the torus , even at a distance of @xmath3100pc , is too warm ( @xmath1100k ) for ice mantles to survive .",
    "to constrain the dust size distribution and the size and geometry of the dust torus , various models have been proposed to explain the observed ir emission spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of agns , radiated by the circumnuclear dust heated by the agn illumination .",
    "these models assume a wide range of torus geometries : uniform density annular ( cylindrical ) rings of a few pc with an extremely large optical depth @xmath48@xmath11000 ( pier & krolik 1992 , 1993 ) , optically thick plane parallel slabs of a few thousand pc ( laor & draine 1993 ) , extended tori of hundreds of pc ( granato & danese 1994 , granato et al .",
    "1997 ) , geometrically thin , optically thick spherical shells ( rowan - robinson 1995 ) , tapered disks ( efstathiou & rowan - robinson 1995 , stenholm 1995 ) , optically thick , flared disks ( manske et al .",
    "1998 ) , clumpy tori ( nenkova et al .  2002 ) , and other more complicated torus geometries ( van bemmel & dullemond 2003 , schartmann et al .  2005 ) . in order to suppress the 9.7@xmath2 silicate emission feature ( which was not detected until very recently by _ spitzer _ ; see  3.3 ) , some models hypothesized that the dust in agns must be large ( @xmath10@xmath2210@xmath2 ) or small silicate grains must be depleted ( e.g. see laor & draine 1993 , granato & danese 1994 ) .",
    "some models ascribed the suppression of the 9.7@xmath2 silicate emission feature to clumpiness ( nenkova et al .",
    "2002 ) or the strong anisotropy of the source radiation ( manske et al .",
    "apparently , more modeling efforts are required to account for the very recent detection of the 9.7@xmath2 and 18@xmath2 silicate emission features in type 1 agns and the recent high resolution ir imaging observations which seem to show that the torus size is no more than a few parsecs ( see elitzur 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "it is well known that the sed modeling alone does not uniquely determine the dust size distribution and the dust spatial distribution .",
