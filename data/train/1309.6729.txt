    "furthermore , we have argued that the electron - phonon coupling leads to an inter - dot tunneling rate that depends on the bias voltage and on the energy difference between the dots , which we identified as the origin of the occurrence of negative differential conductance .",
    "the very generic model we used can readily be probed in nano - electromechanical systems .",
    "experiments employing suspended carbon nanotubes incorporate both , single localized levels and phonon modes .",
    "in addition to that , strong electron - phonon coupling , high @xmath1-factors , and high resonance frequencies make carbon nanotubes perfect candidate devices to study the occurrence of negative differential conductance in double - quantum dot systems with electron - phonon coupling .",
