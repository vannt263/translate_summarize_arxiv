    "low luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagns ) , operationally defined as agns with nuclear h@xmath0 luminosity @xmath1  10@xmath2 erg  s@xmath3 , make up almost 50% of all nearby bright galaxies ( e.g. , ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997a ) .",
    "they are spectroscopically sub - classified into low ionization nuclear emission region nuclei ( liners ) , low luminosity seyferts , and `` transition nuclei '' , whose spectra are intermediate between seyfert / liner and hii region spectra .",
    "evidence has been accumulating that some fraction of llagns share characteristics in common with more powerful agns .",
    "these similarities include the presence of nuclear compact radio cores ( heckman 1980 ) , water vapor megamasers ( braatz et al .",
    "1997 ) , nuclear point - like uv sources ( maoz et al . 1995 ; barth et al . 1998 ) , broad h@xmath0 lines ( ho et al .",
    "1997b ) , and broader h@xmath0 lines in polarized emission than in total emission ( barth et al .",
    "if llagns are truly scaled down agns then the challenge is to explain their much lower accretion luminosities .",
    "this requires either very low accretion rates ( @xmath410@xmath5l@xmath6 ; e.g. falcke & biermann 1999 ) or radiative efficiencies ( the ratio of radiated energy to accreted mass ) much lower than the typical value of @xmath410% ( e.g.  chapter  7.8 of frank , king , & raine 1995 ) assumed for powerful agns .",
    "our radio surveys of the 96 nearest llagns from the palomar spectroscopic survey ( ho et al .",
    "1997a ) have found compact ( 150  mas ) flat - spectrum radio cores in almost half of all liners and low - luminosity seyferts ( nagar et al . 2000 ; 2002 ) .",
    "follow - up observations detected parsec - scale radio cores in all ( 16 ) llagns with s@xmath7  @xmath8 2.7  mjy , implying brightness temperatures @xmath9 10@xmath10  k ( falcke et al .",
    "2000 ; nagar et al .",
    "the five nuclei with the highest core fluxes - ngc  3031 ( bietenholz , bartel , & rupen 2000 ) , ngc  4278 ( jones , wrobel , & shaffer 1984 ; falcke et al .",
    "2000 ) , ngc  4486 ( m  87 ; junor & biretta 1995 ) , ngc  4374 ( m  84 ; wrobel , walker , & bridle 1996 ; nagar et al .",
    "2002 ) , and ngc  4552 ( m  89 ; nagar et al .",
    "2002 ) - all have pc - scale radio extensions , morphologically reminiscent of jets ( e.g. fig .  1 ) .",
    "the high brightness - temperatures rule out an origin for the radio emission in star - formation processes .",
    "thermal emission can also be ruled out as it would imply two to four orders of magnitude higher soft x - ray fluxes than seen in llagns ( see falcke et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "we are currently working on a high - resolution multifrequency radio study of all 16 llagns at d @xmath1 19  mpc with confirmed pc - scale radio cores .",
    "results on the 5  ghz to 15  ghz radio spectra are published in nagar , wilson , & falcke ( 2001 ) . here , for the first time , we present preliminary results on the 1.4  ghz to 667  ghz spectral shape .",
    "all sixteen nuclei have been observed simultaneously at 5  ghz , 8.4  ghz , and 15  ghz with the vla in september 1999 , while the vla was in a - array ( results in nagar et al .",
    "all nuclei were again observed at 8.4  ghz and 43  ghz in december 2000 with the vla a - array , and the brightest eight nuclei were also observed at 22  ghz at this time .",
    "the repeat 8.4  ghz observations were used to scale the flux measurements at 22  ghz and 43  ghz to the previous 515  ghz data ; this , of course , assumes that the 543  ghz spectral shape did not change between the two epochs .",
    "we also observed eleven of the sixteen nuclei with merlin at 1.6  ghz ( 01 resolution ) in december 1999 .",
    "thirteen of the 16 nuclei have been previously observed at 1.4  ghz ( at 5 resolution ) as part of the first vla radio survey ( white et al .",
    "1997 ) during various observing runs between 1997 and 1999 .",
    "finally , we observed four of the sixteen nuclei at 353  ghz ( 850  @xmath11 m ) and 667  ghz ( 450  @xmath11 m ) with jcmt / scuba in january 2001 .",
    "observations of @xmath46 more nuclei with scuba are pending .    for the 5  ghz , 8.4  ghz , and 15  ghz data , we were able to make matched 05 resolution maps . at 22",
    "ghz and 43  ghz the much higher resolution ( 008 and 005 , respectively ) and lower signal to noise , did not allow good maps to be made at 05 resolution , and so we use the full resolution data in these cases .",
    "the radio cores are essentially point sources at 22  ghz and 43  ghz , so it is unlikely that tapered maps will pick up a significant amount of more extended emission . at this stage",
    "our reduction of the merlin data are preliminary so we rely mainly on the 5 resolution , 1.4  ghz fluxes from the first survey .",
    "the scuba data have a resolution of 7 at 667  ghz and 13 at 353  ghz . at these lower resolutions",
    "contamination from dust is likely .",
    "radio spectra of the sixteen nuclei are shown in fig .  2 . the 1.4  ghz data",
    "is from the 5 resolution first data , and if a 01 resolution merlin ( preliminary ) flux exists , it is shown by the diamond at 1.6  ghz . given the higher resolution of merlin we would expect its flux measurement to be lower than that of first , unless there is significant variability . the presence of some higher than expected merlin fluxes is a matter of concern and we are looking more closely into the mapping and flux calibration of these data .",
    "the arcsec - scale spectra in fig .",
    "2 probably closely track that of the mas - scale radio emission given that the peak flux - density in the 05 resolution , 6  cm vla maps is @xmath440%100% of the total flux seen in the ( non - simultaneous ) 2.5  mas resolution , 6  cm vlba maps ( the rectangular symbol at 5  ghz ) .",
    "also , the radio cores show similar fluxes in 8.4  ghz and 15  ghz maps made at the highest resolution ( 03 and 015 , respectively ) as in maps tapered to 05 resolution ( nagar et al .",
    "finally , the high - resolution 22  ghz and 43  ghz maps show only an unresolved core with no evidence of extended structure .",
    "overall the spectra show a steep fall at the high ghz frequencies .",
    "the single exception , ngc  3031 , is a nearby bright spiral with significant nuclear dust ; dust emission can explain the upturn in its sub - mm spectrum .",
    "several nuclei show signs of a spectral peak in the range 1.420  ghz , similar to that found for a few ellipticals by di  matteo et al .",
    "this low frequency turnover is more believable since the 1.4  ghz data have lower resolution than the 5  ghz43  ghz data .",
    "the spectral index above the `` peak '' is @xmath120.4 to @xmath121.4 ( median @xmath120.8 ) , and the spectral index below the `` peak '' is @xmath130.8 to @xmath120.4 ( median @xmath40 ) .",
    "first , we list the main caveats : ( a )  as explained above the 515  ghz and the 2243  ghz data have been normalized by the repeat 8.4  ghz observations .",
    "this assumes that the 543  ghz spectral shape did not change between the two epochs ; ( b )  the 1.4  ghz , 1.6  ghz , and the 353 - 667  ghz data are non - simultaneous with the other data ; ( c )  the resolution varies between 005 for the 43  ghz data and 13 for the jcmt / scuba data .",
    "however , as discussed above , the radio cores are highly compact until mas - scales , so resolution effects should not cause significant bias at @xmath850  mas resolutions .    despite these caveats ,",
    "several deductions can be made from the results .",
    "first , let us restrict ourselves to scenarios in which the radio core is highly compact , e.g. advection dominated ( adaf ) or convection ( cdaf ) dominated accretion flows ( narayan , igumenshchev , & abramowicz 2000 ) . in these models , the radio emission is posited to come from the inner 10@xmath14 - 10@xmath15 schwarzschild radii , i.e. highly sub - parsec for the black hole masses considered here .",
    "thus , the radio fluxes we measure at all of our frequencies represent upper limits to the radio emission from such models .",
    "in fact in cases like this , it is not relevant to determine spectral indices from matched resolution radio maps ; all that accomplishes is a deterioration of the few high resolution datapoints .",
    "we see no evidence of a moderately to highly inverted radio spectrum , as predicted by most adaf and cdaf models ( e.g. quataert & narayan 1999 ; di  matteo et al .",
    "2001 ; summarized in nagar et al .",
    "this tells us that even if such accretion flows exist , the sub - arcsecond radio emission upto 43  ghz ( possibly all the way to 667  ghz ) is dominated by other components .",
    "on the other hand there is significant evidence for jets dominating the sub - arcsec radio emission in llagns .",
    "the 5 nuclei with the highest core mas - scale fluxes all show extended emission , reminiscent of parsec - scale jets ( see section 1 ) . in the three best studied nuclei - m  87 , ngc  3031 , and ngc  4258 - the ` jet ' dominates the ` core ' radio emission ( see nagar et al .",
    "2001 for a discussion of this ) .",
    "the radio spectral shape is also consistent with jet models : the high frequency spectral shape is consistent with optically - thin synchrotron emission , and the low frequency turnover could be caused by synchrotron self - absorption or by free - free absorption .",
    "it is suggestive that the llagns in fig .",
    "2 show several properties in common with gigahertz - peaked spectrum sources ( gpss ; see odea 1998 for a review ) : ( a )  there is some evidence for a peak in the 120  ghz range ; ( b )  milli - arcsec imaging often shows a core - jet or symmetric parsec - scale jets ; ( c )  llagns in fig .",
    "2 have sub - pc scale radio jet extents and spectral peaks in the 5 - 10  ghz range .",
    "they thus extend to higher frequencies the relationship between linear size and turnover frequency in gpss and compact steep spectrum sources ( csss ; see odea et al .",
    "( d )  llagns have a low x - ray luminosity ( e.g. ho et al . 2001 ) , similar to the case of gps galaxies .",
    "in gps sources , the radio emission is posited to come from the expanding lobes of the pc - scale radio jets .",
    "the low frequency turnover is deduced to be the result of synchrotron self - absorption or free - free absorption .",
