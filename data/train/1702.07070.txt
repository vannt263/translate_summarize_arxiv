    "<S> more remarkable is the emergence of full fledged fermi arcs as the folded part of the fs is destroyed by the scattering due to spatially fluctuating pseudospin current . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the observed fermi arcs supported by @xmath5-wave like pseudogaps by arpes and stm in heavily surface k - doped sr@xmath1iro@xmath2 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> _ summary and discussions _ supported by symmetry analysis and the agreement between the calculated qp dispersion and the arpes experiments , we conjecture that the @xmath93 symmetric but @xmath103 breaking @xmath5-wave @xmath6 pseudospin current ( flux ) is a hidden electronic order in perovskite iridates sr@xmath3la@xmath4iro@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the d - psco offers a possible explanation of the splitting of the @xmath6 qp bands near @xmath9 in the canted af insulator at @xmath59 and the gapping of the hole pocket around @xmath9 and the emergence of the electron fs pockets at @xmath33 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , disordered , spatially fluctuating pseudospin current can produce a glassy valence bond state supporting the observed fermi arcs and pseudogap state in surface doped sr@xmath1iro@xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent optical second harmonic generation experiments detected a rotation and inversion symmetry breaking hidden order below @xmath31k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> whether the observation is consistent with an odd - parity magnetic multipole order associated with an orbital current is under debate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the d - psco proposed here in two - dimensions does not break inversion or two - fold rotation within a single layer , further studies on the @xmath14-axis stacking of the d - psco and the magnetic order need to be carried out in order to compare to the second harmonic generation experiments . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the nature of the nonlocal @xmath5-wave pseudospin bond current suggests that it may originate microscopically from intersite electronic interactions in sr@xmath1iro@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , eq .  ( [ spincurrent ] ) </S>",
    "<S> can be obtained by decoupling the nn interatomic coulomb interaction @xmath146 between the @xmath6 quasiparticles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the d - psco can emerge from charge fluctuations of strongly spin - orbit coupled quasiparticles and may coexist with and/or participate in the suppression of the spin - orbit entangled magnetic order under electron doping . </S>",
