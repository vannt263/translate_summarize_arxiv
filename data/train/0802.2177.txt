    "a few years back , it was realized that one of the most trusted absorption lines to gauge the oxygen abundance in the solar photosphere , the forbidden [ oi ] line at @xmath16300 , was blended with a ni i transition .",
    "these two transitions overlap so closely that only a minor distortion is apparent in the observed feature . disentangling the two contributions with the help of a 3-d hydrodynamical simulation of surface convection led us to propose a reduction of the solar photospheric abundance by @xmath2 30% @xcite . using the same solar model , subsequent analysis of other atomic oxygen and",
    "oh lines confirmed the lower abundance , resulting in an average value @xmath3 ( o)@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this reduction in the solar o / h ratio , together with a parallel downward revision for carbon @xcite , ruins the nearly perfect agreement between models of the solar interior and seismological observations @xcite . a brief overview of the proposed solutions is given by @xcite .",
    "interior and surface models appear to describe two different stars .",
    "supporters of the new hydrodynamical models , and the revised surface abundances , focus on their strengths : they include more realistic physics , and are able to reproduce extremely well detailed observations ( oscillations , spectral line asymmetries and net wavelength blueshifts , granulation contrast and topology ) .",
    "detractors emphasize the fact that the new models necessarily employ a simplified description of the radiation field and they have not been tested to the same extent as classical 1-d models .",
    "the calculation of spectra for 3-d time - dependent models is a demanding task , which is likely the main reason why some fundamental tests have not yet been performed for the new models .    on the basis of 1-d radiative transfer calculations , @xcite",

    "( 2000 ) may be incorrect .",
    "@xcite make use of a 1-d average , both horizontal and over time , of the 3-d simulation to analyze the center - to - limb variation in the continuum , finding that the averaged model performs much more poorly than the semi - empirical fal c model of fontenla et al .",
    "when the fal c model is adopted , an analysis of co lines leads to a much higher oxygen abundance , and therefore @xcite question the downward revision proposed earlier .",
    "@xcite argue that when classical 1-d model atmospheres are employed , the inferred oxygen abundance from atomic features differs by only 0.05 dex between an analysis in 1-d and 3-d .",
    "the difference is even smaller for atomic carbon lines .",
    "when the hydrodynamical model is considered , there is good agreement between the oxygen abundance inferred from atomic lines and from oh transitions @xcite .",
    "a high value of the oxygen abundance is derived only when considering molecular tracers in one dimensional atmospheres , perhaps not a surprising result given the high sensitivity to temperature of the molecular dissociation .",
    "a low oxygen abundance ( @xmath5(o ) @xmath6 ) value is also deduced from atomic lines and atmospheric models based on the inversion of spatially resolved polarimetric data @xcite .    despite",
    "the balance seems favorable to the 3-d models and the low values of the oxygen and carbon abundances , a failure of the 3-d model to match the observed limb darkening , as suggested by the experiments of @xcite , would be reason for serious concern . in the present paper , we perform spectral synthesis on the solar surface convection simulation of asplund et al .",

    "the simulation of solar granulation was carried out with a 3-d , time - dependent , compressible , radiative - hydrodynamics code @xcite .",

    "about 10 granules are included in the computed domain at any given time .",
    "99 snapshots were taken in 30s intervals from a shorter sequence of 50min .",
    "the grid points and the physical dimensions are changed to accommodate the spectrum synthesis : the horizontal sampling is reduced by omitting 3 out of 4 grid points in both directions ; the vertical extension is decreased by omitting layers below @xmath8 while keeping the number of grid points in @xmath9-direction constant , i.e. by increasing the vertical sampling and introducing a non - equidistant vertical grid .",
    "after these changes , a single snapshot covers approximately a volume of 6.0x6.0x1.7 mm with 50x50x82 grid points @xcite .      compared to the spectrum synthesis in one dimension",
    ", the calculation of emergent fluxes and intensities from 3-d snapshots is a tremendous task , even when lte is applied .",
    "previous investigations ( e.g. , @xcite ) were limited to the calculation of a single line profile or a blend of very few individual lines on top of constant background opacities , and without scattering . in order to overcome these limitations , we devise a new scheme that is capable of dealing with arbitrary line blends , frequency dependent continuum opacities , and scattering . the spectrum synthesis is divided into five separate tasks that are outlined below . a more detailed description which contains all essential numerical tests will be given by @xcite .",
    "for the 3d calculations we face a situation in which we have to provide detailed opacities for @xmath10 grid points for every single frequency under consideration . under the assumption of lte",
    ", the size of the problem can be reduced substantially by using an interpolation scheme to derive opacities from a dataset that has orders - of - magnitude fewer datapoints .",
    "we introduce an _ opacity _",
    "grid that covers all grid points of the snapshots in the temperature - density plane .",
    "the grid points are regularly spaced in log@xmath11 and log@xmath12 with typical intervals of 0.018dex and 0.25dex , respectively .",

    "additional points are added to the opacity grid .",
    "the estimated interpolation error is well below 0.1% for the setup used throughout the present paper .",
    "we use a modified version of synspec @xcite to prepare frequency - dependent opacities for the relatively small numbers of grid points in the _ opacity _ grid .",
    "the modifications allow for the calculation of opacities on equidistant log(@xmath1 ) scales , to output the opacities to binary files , and to skip the calculation of intensities .",
    "two datasets are produced .",
    "continuum opacities are calculated at intervals of about 1  at 3000 .",
    "full opacities ( continuum and lines ) are provided at a much finer spacing of @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being the thermal velocity of an iron atom at the minimum temperature of all grid points in all snapshots under consideration .",
    "a typical step in wavelength is @xmath16  at 3000 , which corresponds to 0.27 kms@xmath17 .",
    "we adopt the solar photospheric abundances recently proposed by @xcite , with carbon and oxygen abundances of @xmath18 and 8.66 , respectively , which are about 30% less than in earlier compilations @xcite .",
    "we account for bound - bound and bound - free opacities from hydrogen and from the first two ionization stages of he , c , n , o , na , mg , al , si , ca and fe . bound - free cross sections for all metals but iron are taken from topbase and smoothed as described by @xcite .",

    "[ sss_scat ] .",
    "the equation of state is solved considering the first 99 elements and 338 molecular species .",
    "chemical equilibrium is assumed for the calculation of the molecular abundances , and the atomic abundances are updated accordingly ( private comm . from i. hubeny ) .",
    "we employ a background approximation , calculating the radiation field @xmath22 for the sparse continuum frequency points for which we have calculated the continuum opacity without any contribution from spectral lines .",
    "the calculation starts at the bluemost frequency and the velocity field is neglected at this point : no frequency coupling is present .",
    "the opacities for individual grid points are derived by interpolation from the _ opacity _ grid , and the emissivities are calculated assuming lte .",
    "as mentioned above , we include electron ( thomson ) scattering and rayleigh scattering by atomic hydrogen .",
    "an accelerated lambda iteration ( ali ) scheme is used to obtain a consistent solution of the mean radiation field @xmath22 and the source function @xmath23 at all grid points . in turn , @xmath22 is calculated from @xmath23 and vice versa , accelerating the iteration by amplifying @xmath24 by the factor @xmath25 with @xmath26 being the approximate lambda operator @xcite .",
    "generally the mean radiation from the last frequency point , i.e. the frequency to the blue , serves as an initial guess of @xmath22 at the actual frequency . at the first frequency point ,",
    "the iteration starts with @xmath27 .",
    "the formal solution , i.e. the solution of the equation @xmath28 , is obtained by means of a short characteristics scheme @xcite . for all grid points the angle - dependent intensity @xmath29 is derived by integrating the source function along the ray between the grid point itself and the closest intersection of the ray with a horizontal or vertical plane in the mesh .",
    "the operator @xmath26 needed for the acceleration is calculated within the formal solution .",
    "for the present calculations , @xmath22 is integrated from @xmath29 at 48 angles ( 6 in @xmath30 , 8 in @xmath31 ) .",
    "the integration in @xmath30 is performed by a three - point gaussian quadrature for each half - space , i.e. for rays pointing to the outer and the inner boundary , respectively .",
    "the integration in @xmath31 is trapezoidal .",
    "the opacities and source functions are assumed to vary linearly ( 1@xmath32-order scheme ) along the ray .    in order to integrate the intensity between the grid point and the point of intersection where the ray leaves the grid cell , the opacity , source function and the specific intensity ( @xmath33 , @xmath23 , @xmath29 ) have to be provided at both ends of the ray . since the point where the ray leaves the cell is generally not a grid point itself , an interpolation scheme has to be employed to derive the required quantities .",
    "we perform interpolations in two dimensions on the surfaces of the cuboids applying again bezier polynomials with control values that avoid the introduction of artificial extrema .",
    "the interpolation may introduce a noticeable source of numerical inaccuracies .",
    "detailed tests , using an artificial 3-d structure constructed by horizontally replicating a 1-d model , revealed that a 3@xmath13-order interpolation scheme provides sufficient accuracy where linear interpolations fail in reproducing the radiation field : the mean relative errors are 0.5% and 0.05% for linear and cubic interpolation , respectively .",
    "it is possible , in terms of computing time , to calculate @xmath22 from the full opacity dataset for all frequencies ( our fine sampling ) .",
    "however , since the total effect of scattering for the solar case in the optical is quite small , the differences between the two methods are negligible .",
    "therefore , we apply the faster method throughout this paper .",
    "note that in both approximations ( using background or full opacities ) , the calculation of the mean radiation field does not account for any frequency coupling .",
    "the emergent flux is calculated from the opacities of the full dataset provided at the fine frequency grid .",
    "again , the opacities for individual grid points are derived by interpolation from the _ opacity _ grid and the emissivities are calculated from lte .",
    "the mean background radiation field @xmath22 is interpolated from the coarser continuum frequency grid to the actual frequency , and it contributes to the source function at all grid points via thomson and rayleigh ( atomic hydrogen ) scattering opacities .",
    "the integration along a ray is performed in the observer s frame by following long characteristics from the top layer down to optical depths of @xmath34 .",
    "frequency shifts due to the velocity field are applied to the opacities and source functions .",
    "each ray starts at a grid point of the top layer and is built by the points of intersection of the ray and the mesh . at these points of intersection",
    "an interpolation in three dimensions is generally performed , i.e. a 2-d geometric interpolation in the x - y , x - z or y - z - plane , respectively , is enhanced by an interpolation in frequency necessitated by the presence of the velocity field .",
    "additional points are inserted into the ray to ensure full frequency coverage of the opacities .",
    "this is done when the difference of the velocity field projected onto the ray between the entry and exit point of a grid cell exceeds the frequency spacing of the opacity . without these additional points and in the presence of large velocity gradients , line opacities",
    "could be underestimated along the ray a line could be shifted to one side at the entry point and to the other side at the exit point , leaving only neighboring continuum opacities visible to both points while the line is hidden within the cell .",
    "similar to the calculation of the mean radiation field @xmath35 described in sect .",
    "[ sss_scat ] , all interpolations in both space and frequency are based on piecewise cubic bezier polynomials .",
    "it is not completely trivial to mention that for the accurate calculation of the emergent intensities , the application of a high - order interpolation scheme is much more important than it is for the calculation of the mean background radiation field ( sect .",
    "[ sss_scat ] ) .",
    "here we are calculating precisely the quantity we are interested in , i.e. specific intensities .",
    "but , in addition to that , we deal with interpolations in three dimensions ( 2-d in space , 1-d in frequency ) instead of a 2-d interpolation in space .",
    "hence , any quantity is derived from 21 1-d interpolations rather than just 5 .    in the standard setup of the 3-d calculations ,",
    "20 rays are used for the integration of the flux @xmath36 from the intensities @xmath29 .",
    "similar to the integration of @xmath35 described in sect .",
    "[ sss_scat ] , the integration in @xmath30 is a three - point gaussian quadrature , while the integration in @xmath31 is trapezoidal .",
    "eight angles in @xmath31 are assigned to the first two of the @xmath30 angles while the last and most inclined angle with the by far smallest ( flux ) integration weight has 4 contributing @xmath31 angles .",
    "note that for the investigation of the center - to - limb variation , the number of angles and their distribution in @xmath30 and @xmath31 differs considerably from this standard setup , as explained below ( sect .",
    "[ ss_continuum ] ) .      to facilitate consistent comparisons of spectra from 3-d _ and _ 1-d models ,",
    "the new spectrum synthesis code ass@xmath0 t accepts also 1-d structures as input .",
    "consistency is achieved by the use of the same opacity data ( cf .",
    "[ sss_opac ] ) and its interpolation ( if desired in 1-d , cf . sect .",
    "[ sss_opai ] ) and by the application of the same radiation transfer solvers , i.e. 1@xmath37-order short and long - characteristic schemes ( cf . sect .",
    "[ sss_scat ] and [ ss_cif ] , respectively ) .",
    "all angle integrations are performed by means of a three - point gaussian formula .",
    "this leaves the interpolations inherent to the radiation transfer scheme in 3-d as the only major inconsistency between the spectra in 1-d and 3-d .",
    "numerical tests have revealed that these remaining inconsistencies are quite small , as we will report in an upcoming paper .",
    "our choice is not to use a semi - empirical model of the solar atmosphere as a 1-d comparison with the 3-d hydrodynamical simulation , but a theoretical model atmosphere .",
    "semi - empirical models take advantage of observations to constrain the atmospheric structure , a fact that would constitute an unfair advantage over the 3-d simulation .",
    "some semi - empirical models , in particular , use observed limb darkening curves , and of course it is meaningless to test their ability to reproduce the same or different observations of the center - to - limb variation in the continuum .",
    "consequently we are using models from kurucz , the marcs group , and a horizontal- and time - averaged representation of the 3-d hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "we have derived a 1-d solar reference model from the kurucz grid @xcite .",

    "details of the interpolation scheme will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we have adopted the usual values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( cgs ) but a reduced metallicity of @xmath44 in an attempt to account globally for the difference between the solar abundances ( mainly iron ) used in the calculation of the model and more recent values , as described by @xcite . to avoid a biased result by using a single 1-d comparison model , we have also experimented with a solar marcs model kindly provided by m. asplund , and a solar model interpolated from the more recent odfnew grid from kurucz ( available on his website ) .",
    "no metallicity correction was applied to these newer solar models .    in earlier investigations",

    ", the validity of this approach has never been established . in order to investigate the limitations of this shortcut",
    ", we compare its center - to - limb variation in the continuum with the exact result from the 3-d radiation transfer on the full series of snapshots .",
    "@xcite investigated the center - to - limb variation of the sun based on observations taken at the national solar observatory / kitt peak in 1986 and 1987 .",
    "they describe the observed intensities across the solar disk as a function of the heliocentric distance by 5@xmath45-order polynomials for 30 frequencies between 303 nm and 1099 nm .",
    "similar observations by @xcite and @xcite ( with a smaller spectral coverage ) indicate that @xcite may have overcorrected for scattered light , but confirm a level of accuracy of @xmath460.4% .",
    "we have calculated fluxes and intensities for small spectral regions ( @xmath47 ) around eight frequencies ( corresponding to standard air wavelengths of 3033.27 , 3499.47 , 4163.19 , 4774.27 , 5798.80 , 7487.10 , 8117.60 , 8696.00 ) and compare monochromatic synthetic intensities with the data from @xcite . because the spectral regions are essentially free from absorption lines , the width of the bandpass of the observations varying between 1.5 kms@xmath17 in the blue ( 3030 ) and 1.9 kms@xmath17 in the red ( 10990 ) is irrelevant .",
    "the fluxes were integrated from 20/3 angles ( cf . sects .",
    "[ ss_cif ] and [ ss_1d ] ) for the 3-d/1-d calculations , respectively . for the study of the clv , intensities ( as a function of @xmath30 ) were calculated for 11 positions on the sun ( @xmath48 ) averaging over 4 directions in @xmath31 and all horizontal ( x - y ) positions .",
    "all 99 snapshots were utilized for the 3-d calculations .",
    "[ hbtp ]    the eight frequencies cover a broad spectral range .",
    "although some neighboring features are poorly matched by our synthetic spectra , the solar flux spectrum of @xcite is reproduced well at the frequencies selected by neckel & labs , and therefore modifications of our linelist were deemed unnecessary ( see fig .  [ fig_fluxc ] ) .",
    "the normalization of the synthetic spectra was achieved by means of `` pure - continuum '' fluxes that were derived from calculations lacking all atomic and molecular line opacities  fig .",
    "[ fig_fluxc ] shows that neckel & labs did a superb job selecting continuum windows .",

    "in addition to the data derived from our 1-d kurucz model ( cf . sect .",
    "[ ss_km ] ) , we show also data from two other 1-d models , i.e. a marcs model ( 1@xmath32 panel ) from asplund ( priv . comm . ) and an alternative ( odfnew ) kurucz model ( 2@xmath50 panel ) from a different model grid ( http://kurucz.harvard.edu/grids.html ) .",
    "the center - to - limb variation from both alternatives show much larger residuals and are not used for the comparison with the 3-d data .",
    "however , the scatter within the 1-d data demonstrates vividly the divergence that still persist among different 1-d models .",
    "our reference 1-d model ( 3@xmath13 panel ) describes the observed clv s well down to @xmath51 .",

    "[ hbtp ]    the investigation of the center - to - limb variation of the continuum is an effective tool to probe the continuum forming region at and above @xmath56 .",
    "deviations from the observed clv s indicate that the temperature gradient around @xmath57 is incorrectly reproduced by the model atmosphere .",
    "this can , of course , mean that the gradient in the model is inaccurate , but it can also signal that the opacity used for the construction of the model atmosphere differs significantly from the opacity used for the spectrum synthesis . in that case , the temperature gradient is tested at the wrong depth due to the shift of the @xmath38-scales .",
    "our spectrum calculations suffer from an inconsistency introduced by the fact that the abundance pattern and the opacity cross - sections might differ from what was used when the model was constructed . in our reference 1-d model , we compensate for the new solar iron abundance ( @xmath58 ) and interpolate to @xmath44 in the kurucz model grid ( cf .",

    "consequently , only metals that contribute to the electron density and therefore to the h@xmath60 population ( i.e. fe , si and mg ) are relevant .",
    "[ hbtp ]    in order to investigate the impact of changes of the opacity on the center - to - limb variation we have calculated the r - clv s for the 3-d and our reference 1-d models at 3499.47  with two different fe abundances ( @xmath61 dex ) .",
    "the purpose of the test is to demonstrate the general effect of opacity variations that can come from different sources , i.e. uncertainties of abundances and uncertainties of bound - free cross - sections of all relevant species ( not only iron ) .",

    "our current study documents that the mean 3-d model is not a valid approximation of the 3-d time series , and therefore its performance can not be taken as indicative of the performance of the 3-d model , and in particular of its temperature profile .",

    "indicate that the observed co ro - vibrational lines are consistent with the low oxygen and carbon abundances .",
    "our results show that there is no reason to distrust the 3-d - based abundances on the basis of the simulations having a wrong thermal profile .",
    "we study the center - to - limb variation of a number of lines by comparing observations of the quiet sun taken at 6 different heliocentric angles to synthetic profiles derived from 3-d and 1-d models .",

    "first of all , any clear trend with @xmath30 would reveal shortcomings of the theoretical model atmospheres similar to our findings presented in sect .",
    "[ ss_continuum ] .",
    "but , arguably , even more relevant is the fact that any significant deviation ( scatter ) would add to the error bar attached to a line - based abundance determination .    in our present study",
    "we compare synthetic line profiles from 3-d and 1-d models with the observations . due to the inherent deficiencies of the latter models , i.e. no velocity fields and correspondingly narrow and symmetric line profiles , etc . , we focus on line strengths and compare observed and synthetic line equivalent widths , rather than comparing the line profiles in detail . to be able to detect weak deviations , we have devised the following strategy .",
    "we have identified wavelength intervals around each line under consideration for the contribution to the line equivalent widths and have calculated series of synthetic line profiles in 1-d and 3-d with varied log-@xmath69 values that encircle the observations with respect to their equivalent widths . that allowed us to determine by interpolation the log-@xmath69 value required to match the observed line equivalent widths separately for each position angle ( `` best - fit '' ) .",
    "to keep interpolation errors at a marginal level we have applied a small step of @xmath75(log-@xmath76 for these series of calculations .",
    "a simple normalization scheme has been applied .",
    "all profiles have been divided by the maximum intensity found in the vicinity of the line center(within @xmath77 ) .",
    "we convolved the synthetic profiles with a gaussian as to mimic the instrumental profile ( see table 1 ) .",
    "an additional gaussian broadening is applied to the line profiles from the 1-d calculation to account for macro - turbulence ; this value was adjusted for each line in order to reproduce the line profiles observed at the disk center .",
    "finally we have translated variations of line strength into variations of abundance , i.e. we have identified @xmath75 log-(@xmath69 ) = @xmath75log-@xmath0 .",
    "this approximation is valid because the impact of slight changes in a metal abundance on the continuum in the optical is marginal .",
    "note that it is not the intent of this study to derive metal abundances from individual lines .",
    "such an endeavor would require a more careful consideration regarding line blends , continuum normalization , and non - lte effects .",
    "all calculations described in this section are single - line calculations , i.e. no blends with atomic or molecular lines are accounted for .",
    "the observations did not have information on the absolute wavelength scale ( see allende prieto et al .",
    "2004 ) , but that is not important for our purposes and the velocity scales in figs .",
    "[ fig_l1 ] and [ fig_l2 ] are relative to center of the line profiles .",
    "the individual synthetic profiles were convolved with a gaussian profile to match the observed profiles ( cf .",
    "table  [ tabi ] ) .",
    "we were generally able to achieve a better fit of the observations when slightly less broadening was applied to the 3-d profiles ( 0.3% in case of fei 5242.5 ) . since we know from previous investigations that the theoretical profiles derived from 3-d hydro - models match the observations well",
    ", we argue that the resolution of the observations is actually slightly higher than estimated by @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation would be that the amplitude of the velocity field in the models is too high .",
    "such a finding , if confirmed , deserves a deeper investigation but is beyond the scope of this study since line equivalent widths are only marginally ( if at all ) affected .    we introduce the lines under consideration by showing the observed center - disk line profiles and the `` best - fits '' derived from the 3-d calculations of the six fei lines and the four lines from other ions in figs .",
    "[ fig_l1 ] and [ fig_l2 ] , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig_lex ] we exemplify the fitting process by means of the fei line at 5242.5  and show the relative difference between the observation and a variety of model calculations for all 6 angles under consideration .",
    "the `` best - fit '' log-@xmath69 values are derived by interpolation to match the observed equivalent widths from the spectral region around the line profile .",
    "[ hbtp ]    we have obtained `` best - fits '' for all 10 lines ( cf .",
    "table  [ tabi ] ) and present the log-@xmath69 values as a function of @xmath30 in fig .",
    "[ fig_clvl ] . be reminded that the aim of this study is not the measurement of absolute abundances : we focus on relative numbers and normalize our results with respect to the disk center ( @xmath78 ) .    for improved readability",
    "we subdivide our findings presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_clvl ] into 4 distinct groups , i.e. iron / non - iron lines and 1-d/3-d calculations , respectively .",
    "we focus our discussion on the first five data points because we have some indications that the data obtained for the shallowest angle is less trustworthy than the data from the other angles : _ i _ ) the relative contribution of scattered light was estimated from the comparison of the center - disk spectrum with the fts spectrum taken from @xcite , and the outer - most position was the only one for which the entire slit was not illuminated , _ ii _ ) for all 10 lines the fit of the line profiles for this particular angle is the worst ( cf .",
    "[ fig_lex ] ) and _ iii _ ) the scatter in our data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_clvl ] is the largest for this angle .",
    "fortunately , the flux integration is naturally biased towards the center of the disk .",
    "we find this systematic behavior for all 6 iron lines : @xmath79 is larger or equal in 1-d compared to 3-d , for all but one line ( fei 6170.5 ) @xmath80 is positive or zero for the 1-d calculations , and @xmath79 is negative or zero for all 3-d calculations .",
    "the fei line at 6170.5  stands out in both comparisons . in 1-d",
    "it is the only line with a negative @xmath79 and in 3-d it shows the by far largest negative @xmath79 .",
    "this might be related to the noticeable line blend ( cf .",
    "[ fig_l1 ] ) .",
    "the iron lines calculated in 3-d indicate a uniform trend of decreased log-@xmath69 values with increased distance from the center - disk .",
    "the average decrease at @xmath68 for this group is -0.015 ( fei 6170.5  excluded ) . from the 1-d calculations we derive the opposite trend for the same group of lines and obtain an average of 0.103 .",
    "obviously , the 3-d model performs significantly better than the 1-d reference model regarding the center - to - limb variation of fe i lines , even when equivalent widths , and not line asymmetries or shifts , are considered .",
    "for these five fei lines we obtain an average difference ( 1-d vs. 3-d ) of 0.12 at @xmath68 . to estimate the impact on abundance determinations based on solar fluxes we apply a 3-point gaussian integration , neglecting the shallowest angle at @xmath81 ( which has , by far , the smallest integration weight ) for which we have no data , and assuming that the good agreement between the 1-d and the 3-d calculations for the central ray implies an equally good agreement for the first angle at @xmath82 .",
    "these estimates lead to an abundance correction of approximately 0.06 dex between 1-d and 3-d models due to their different center - to - limb variation .",
    "@xcite found a similar correction from the comparison of 1-d and 3-d line profiles at the disk center .",
    "for the 4 non - iron lines we find a uniform trend of increasing log-@xmath69 values with decreasing @xmath30 for both , the 1-d and the 3-d dataset .",
    "the systematic behavior is similar to what we find for the iron lines , but now the performance of the 1-d and 3-d models is similar , and the offsets are in the same sense : larger abundances would be found towards the limb for both models .",
    "the photosphere of cool stars and the sun can be described by stellar atmospheres in 1-d and 3-d .",
    "since the 3-d models add more realistic physics , i.e. the hydrodynamic description of the gas , they can be seen truly as an advancement over the 1-d models . however , this refinement increases the computational effort by many orders of magnitude .",
    "in fact , the computational workload becomes so demanding , that the description of the radiation field has to be cut back to very few frequencies , i.e. to a rudimentary level that had been surpassed by 1-d models over 30 years ago .",
    "overall we are left with the astonishing situation that a stellar photosphere can be modeled by either an accurate description of the radiation field with the help of a makeshift account of stellar convection ( mixing - length theory ) , or by an accurate description of the hydrodynamic properties augmented by a rudimentary account of the radiation field .",
    "it is evident that individual line profiles can be described to a much higher degree and without any artificial micro- or macro - turbulence by the 3-d hydro models , as the simulations account for doppler - shifts from differential motions within the atmosphere .",
    "we know from detailed investigations of line profiles that the velocity field is described quite accurately and that the residuals of the fittings to line profiles are reduced by about a factor of 10 . however , it is not obvious how the 3-d models compare to their 1-d counterparts when it comes to reproduce spectral energy distributions and line strengths .",
    "we study the solar center - to - limb variation for several lines and continua , to probe the temperature structure of 3-d models .",
    "the work is facilitated by the new code ass@xmath0 t , which allows for the fast and accurate calculation of spectra from 3-d structures . in comparisons to other programs ( e.g. @xcite ) ,",
    "the attributes of the new code are a greater versatility , i.e. the ability to handle arbitrarily complicated lines blends on top of non - constant background opacities , higher accuracy due to the proper incorporation of scattering and improved ( higher - order ) interpolation schemes , and a higher computational speed .    in our study",
    "we find that regarding center - to - limb variations , the overall shortcomings of the 3-d model are roughly comparable to the shortcomings of the 1-d models .",
    "firstly , we conclude from the investigation of the continuum layers that the models temperature gradient is too steep around @xmath83 . this behavior is more pronounced for the 3-d model which shows a drop in intensity ( with @xmath30 ) that is about twice the size of the drop displayed by our reference 1-d model , but at the same time smaller than the discrepancies found for two other ( newer ! ) 1-d structures .",
    "secondly , the line profiles for different position angles on the sun can not be reproduced by a single abundance .",
    "for fe i lines , the abundance variation between the disk center and @xmath68 is about 0.1 dex for our reference 1-d model , but only @xmath84 dex ( and with the opposite sign ) for the 3-d simulations , albeit the calculations for lines of other neutral species suggest a more balanced outcome .",
    "overall we conclude that the 1-d and the 3-d models match the observed temperature structure to a similar degree of accuracy .",
    "this is somewhat surprising but it might be that the improved description of the convective energy transport is offset by deficiencies introduced by the poor radiation transfer . once new hydro models based on an upgraded radiation transfer scheme ( i.e. more frequencies and angles , better frequency binning ) become available in the near future ( asplund , priv",
    ". comm . ) , we will be able to test this hypothesis",
    ". it will become clear whether focusing on refining the radiation transfer will be enough to achieve better agreement with observations , or the hydrodynamics needs to be improved as well .",
