    "the large magnitude of the coupling constant , @xmath4 , in strong interaction implies that sea quarks , like valence quarks and gluons , represent an integral part of the nucleon s structure . unlike the valence quarks in the nucleons , which are restricted to the @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the sea quarks can have any quark flavors .",
    "this leads to a potentially rich flavor structure for the nucleon sea and could offer new insights on the nucleon structure .",
    "while decades of experimental and theoretical work has focused on the valence quark distributions , many important properties of the sea quarks , including their flavor , spin , and momentum dependencies , remain to be better determined .",
    "a major surprise in the flavor structure of the nucleon sea was found when deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) and drell - yan experiments showed that the @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the proton have strikingly different bjorken-@xmath2 dependence  @xcite .",
    "theoretical models which can explain this flavor asymmetry also have specific predictions on other aspects of spin and flavor structures of sea quarks .",
    "for example , the @xmath9 and @xmath10 distributions are predicted to be different in , e.g. , the meson cloud model  @xcite , the statistical model  @xcite , and the chiral soliton model  @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate how the flavor asymmetry between @xmath7 and @xmath8 is extended to the su(3 ) case when the @xmath11 and @xmath12 seas are included .",
    "our knowledge on the strange quark contents in the nucleons comes primarily from neutrino dis and charged - lepton semi - inclusive dis ( sidis ) experiments . from neutrino dis ,",
    "the momentum fraction carried by @xmath13 , integrated over the measured @xmath2 range , is found to be roughly half of that carried by the lighter @xmath14 quarks  @xcite , reflecting a broken su(3 ) symmetry for the proton s sea . in 2008 ,",
    "the hermes collaboration reported a determination of @xmath15 over the range of @xmath16 at @xmath17 gev@xmath18 from their measurement of sidis for charged - kaon production on a deuteron target with @xmath19 beam  @xcite .",
    "the invariant mass of the photon - nucleon system @xmath20 is required to be greater than @xmath21 gev .",
    "the hermes result shows an intriguing feature that @xmath15 for @xmath22 rises rapidly with decreasing @xmath2 , becoming comparable to @xmath23 from the cteq6l parton distribution function ( pdf )  @xcite at @xmath24 .",
    "the fermilab e866 drell - yan experiment also shows that the @xmath25 ratio approaches unity at the lowest value of @xmath2 ( @xmath260.02 )  @xcite .",
    "these results suggest the presence of an su(3 ) flavor symmetric proton sea in the small-@xmath2 region .",
    "recently , the atlas collaboration determined the strange - to - down sea - quark ratio @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) to be 1.00@xmath29 at @xmath30 and @xmath31 gev@xmath18 from an analysis of inclusive @xmath20 and @xmath32 boson production in @xmath33 collisions at 7 tev  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the atlas collaboration determined the same ratio @xmath27 to be @xmath34 at @xmath35=1.9 gev@xmath18 from their measurement of the associated @xmath36 production at lhc  @xcite .",
    "these results strongly suggests an su(3)-symmetric light - quark sea , i.e. , @xmath37 , in the small-@xmath2 region .",
    "results from hermes , atlas , as well as the earlier neutrino results , imply a strong @xmath2 dependence for the @xmath38/[\\bar u(x ) + \\bar d(x)]$ ] ratio .    another intriguing aspect of the nucleon sea is the concept of  intrinsic \" sea , suggested by brodsky , hoyer , peterson , and sakai ( bhps )  @xcite to explain the enhanced production rates for charmed hadrons in the forward rapidity region . the @xmath39 component in the @xmath40 is called the  intrinsic \" sea in order to distinguish it from the conventional  extrinsic \" sea originating from the @xmath41   qcd process .",
    "the intrinsic sea is predicted to have a valence - like momentum distribution peaking at relatively large @xmath2 .",
    "this is in contrast to the extrinsic sea , which dominates in the small-@xmath2 region due to gluon splitting .",
    "recently , the concept of intrinsic charm was generalized to the light - quark sector  @xcite .",
    "since the probability for the @xmath42 fock state is expected to be roughly proportional to @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the mass of quark @xmath45 , these light - quark intrinsic seas should be more abundant than the intrinsic charm quark . using the kaon sidis data from hermes on @xmath46  @xcite , the e866 drell - yan data on @xmath47  @xcite , and the cteq6.6 pdf  @xcite",

    "recently , the hermes collaboration reported the latest result on charged - kaon multiplicities where a multi - dimensional unfolding procedure was performed  @xcite .",
    "this led to a reevaluation of the strange - quark distributions , @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "depending on the kaon fragmentation function adopted in the analysis , two distinct results , corresponding to significantly different @xmath0 at the @xmath52 region , were obtained by the hermes collaboration  @xcite . since the hermes result on @xmath0 is a crucial input for the extraction of the intrinsic light - quark sea , we have extended our previous analysis  @xcite to take into account the latest hermes results . in this paper , we first discuss the uncertainties in the extraction of @xmath0 associated with the uncertainty in the kaon fragmentation functions which are still poorly known .",
    "we then recapitulate the procedure to extract the intrinsic sea in the bhps model and present the updated results on the extraction of the intrinsic light - quark sea using several different assumptions for the kaon fragmentation functions .",
    "the @xmath2 dependence of the @xmath53 ratio is also discussed in the context of the extrinsic and intrinsic seas .",
