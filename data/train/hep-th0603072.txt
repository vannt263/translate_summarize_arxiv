    "effective potential plays a very important role in quantum field theory and much have been studied about it for various types of fields .",
    "it is very useful in the study of symmetry breaking , since the broken symmetry of classical potential may be restored due to quantum corrections .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study the behaviour of effective potential of a scalar field in higher dimensions .",
    "the motivation for this study is due to recent developments in higher dimensional theories which try to bring gravity and other fundamental interactions in single theory @xcite . in recent times scalar fields",
    "have been studied in higher dimensions to address many issues in particle physics and cosmology like inflation , cosmological constant , dark energy , etc .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effective potential formally by calculating the one - loop approximation and critical temperature for symmetry restoration in higher dimensions . it is interesting to see how the one - loop correction and critical temperature will behave in higher dimensions .",
    "we consider @xmath3 theory in five dimensions , but it is known @xmath3 theory is not renormalisable in five dimensions .",
    "non - renormalisibility of the theory does not mean that theory is not interesting , it may be part of high energy theory which is renormalisable .",
    "another feature of the scalar field in five dimensions is that the coupling constant @xmath4 is dimensionful . to calculate effective potential",
    ", we follow the diagrammatic approach up to one - loop order .",
    "the momentum integral is divergent in the expression for one - loop correction and we apply a cut - off @xmath5 to compute it . in the present work we are able to get a finite expression for one - loop effective potential and show that it is possible to regularize @xmath3 theory in five dimensions .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath1 can be found by using functional diagrmatic approach of dolan and jackiw @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows in section ii we compute the zero temperature one - loop approximation . section iii deals with temperature one loop correction and the critical temperature .",
    "results and conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "consider a scalar @xmath3 theory in five dimensions ( 5d ) , the signature of the metric is ( + , -,-,-,- ) .",
    "the action for the scalar field with a source term can be written as @xmath6.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + the tree level potential is given by @xmath7 since the coupling constant @xmath4 acquires dimensions in 5d , it is divided by @xmath2 to make it dimensionless , which is the fundamental scale of the theory .",
    "the generating functional is @xmath8=e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}w[j]}.\\ ] ] where w[j ] is the generating functional for the connected green s functions @xcite . in quantum field theory",
    "we study effective action @xmath9 which is the legendre transform of w[j ] . in 5d",
    "it can be written as @xmath10&=&w[j]-\\int d^{5}x j(x ) \\varphi_{c}(x).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11}{\\delta j(x)}\\ ] ] and @xmath12 alternatively expanding the effective action in powers of momentum and neglecting higher order terms in @xmath13 .",
    "and in limit @xmath14 , for  @xmath15 is constant , we get @xmath16=-(2\\pi)^{5 } \\delta(0)v(\\varphi_c)=-\\omega v(\\varphi_c).\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is effective potential in five dimensions and @xmath18 is the space - time volume .",
    "now the effective potential contains quantum corrections of different orders .",
    "we can calculate these corrections peturbatively by loop expansion .",
    "hence @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the tree potential and @xmath21 is the one - loop correction .",
    "the one - loop contribution is computed using the techniques developed earlier and can be written in closed form .",
    "the one loop contribution to effective potential in 5d is obtained as @xmath22 where shifted mass @xmath23 .",
    "+ now rotating to euclidean space , @xmath24 @xmath25 but the integral in eqn ( 11 ) is divergent .",
    "it has ultra - violet divergence and its degree of divergence is three . to make the theory meaningful",
    "we should make it finite by using renormalisation technique .",
    "for this we first regularise the theory by applying cut - off regularisation method .",
    "so , we introduce cut off @xmath26 on all loop momenta and solve the integral to get @xmath27 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus an expression for one - loop potential in five dimensions is obtained .",
    "but the expression is still divergent when @xmath28 . in general",
    "this infinities are absorbed by adding counter terms to the above expression and using suitable renormalisation conditions . since the @xmath3 theory is not renormalisable in 5 dimensions it is interesting to see if we can add counterterms to the lagrangian and get rid of atleast some of the divergent amplitude .",
    "the effective potential with counter terms is @xmath29\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are mass and coupling constant renormalization counterterms .",
    "we use the following renormalisation conditions @xmath32 after detailed calculations , imposing conditions ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) , we obtain the counter terms as @xmath33 and @xmath34 now substiuting this counter terms in eqn ( 13 ) , we get the effective potential @xmath35.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] neglecting the field independent terms , and terms which vanish in the limit @xmath36 in eqn ( 18 ) , the effective potential with one loop correction is obtained as @xmath37.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus eqn ( 19 ) shows that we have been able to remove @xmath26 successfully and a finite expression for one loop potential using @xmath3 theory in 5d is obtained .",
    "thus it is useful to study effective potential for @xmath3 theory in 5d .",
    "in this section we calculate one - loop approximation with temperature corrections .",
    "consider the following lagrangian @xmath38 now shift the field by some constant field @xmath39 and considering quadratic part of shifted lagrangian , zero loop potential is @xmath40 from our discussion in previous section one - loop approximation is given by ( @xmath41 ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 . from the standard techniques of four dimensions used previously",
    ", we can get a similar expression for the five dimensions as @xmath44.\\ ] ] the first term in eqn ( 24 ) is the zero temperature one - loop correction and is computed in previous section eqn ( 19 ) .",
    "the second term can be written as @xmath45 this is the finite temperature contribution to the potential . from this",
    "we can calculate @xmath1 , following the method in ref @xcite , i.e using expansion in @xmath46 @xmath47}{8\\pi^2 \\beta^5 } + \\frac{2\\zeta[3 ] m^2}{16 \\pi^2 \\beta^3 } -\\frac{m^3}{16\\pi \\beta^2 } - \\frac{3\\ ; m^4}{64 \\pi^2 \\beta } b    \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{m^4}{32 \\pi^2 \\beta}\\hbox{ln}(m^2\\beta^2 ) + \\frac{1}{120 \\pi^2}m^5 + o(m^6 \\beta ) ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath48 .",
    "now we are in a position to study the symmetry restoration .",
    "we assume the lagrangian has a symmetry which means that in the absence of source , @xmath49 . on the other hand symmetry breaking",
    "occurs when @xmath50 , indicated by eqn ( 6 ) . the complete potential given by eqn ( 8) can be rewritten into zero temparature and temperature dependent part as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the zero temperature potential including the one loop correction .",
    "the symmetry breaking occurs at zero temperature i.e. @xmath53 at @xmath54 . and the symmetry breaking will disappear when @xcite @xmath55 now , we see if the temperature dependent part of the potential can restore the symmetry . using eqn ( 27 )",
    "the symmetry restoration condition of eqn ( 28 ) becomes @xmath56 where the first term is the renormalised mass of the theory given by eqn ( 14 ) .",
    "thus the critical temperature becomes @xmath57 we obtained an expression for critical temperature as negative of mass squared and @xmath58 is considered positive since symmetry breaking occurs at zero temperature .",
    "thus when @xmath59 , the temperature dependent mass is dominant and the effective mass becomes positive and condition ( 28 ) is satisfied and hence the symmetry is restored .    now using eqn ( 30 ) we obtain @xmath60 \\lambda},\\ ] ] where we use only on first two terms for calulation of critical temperature .",
    "term to calculate @xmath1 , but there will not be significant change in the numerical value of critical temperature . ] at temperatures above this critical temperature the symmetry is restored and below it symmetry will be broken .",
    "now we will confirm our result , by trying to obtain @xmath1 without actually calculating effective potential .",
    "that is by calculating self - mass correction @xmath61 where @xmath62 is @xmath63 , and hence @xmath64 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have assumed that mass counter terms cancels with the zero temperature contribution .",
    "thus @xmath65}{16 \\pi^2 { \\cal{m } } \\beta^3 } -   \\frac{3 \\ ; \\lambda}{32 \\pi { \\cal{m } } \\beta^2 } m + o(\\frac{m^2}{\\beta}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore the critical temperature can be obtained from the following expression @xmath66 it is clear that the value for @xmath1 from the eqn ( 35 ) , relying on @xmath67 term will be same as in eqn ( 31 ) .",
    "thus , we obtained the critical temperature for symmetry restoration for the scalar field in 5d .     1   and @xmath68 .",
    "( 1 ) shows broken symmetry at @xmath69 .",
    "( 2 ) shows behaviour at @xmath70 less than @xmath71 .",
    "( 3 ) shows symmetry being restored at @xmath72 i.e @xmath73 .",
    "( 4 ) shows behaviour at @xmath74 and symmetry is restored .",
    "( 5 ) shows behaviour of finite temperature effective potential at @xmath75 i.e @xmath76 where symmetry is completely restored.[f1],title=\"fig : \" ]    next we study the behaviour of symmetry by examining the effective potential ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "here we consider lowest order interaction i.e @xmath78 , in this limit we plot @xmath77 as function of @xmath79 for different values of temperature .",
    "figs 1.1 - 5 shows behaviour of @xmath77 for different temperatures . at temperature @xmath69 fig(1.1 ) we have two degenerate minima indicating a symmetry broken phase .",
    "the effective potential for @xmath70 which less than @xmath71 still has symmetry broken phase .",
    "for @xmath73 we observe there are no longer two minima , indicates that it is going to symmetry restored phase . when temperature is more than @xmath71 there is only one minimum at @xmath80 showing restoration of symmetry . at @xmath81",
    "effective potential has unique minimum showing symmetry persists .",
    "therefore we observe that the transition from one phase to other phase is continuous and hence it is a second order phase transition .",
    "in this work , we calculated the effective potential for a scalar field up to one loop order .",
    "the scalar field is considered in five dimensions and we applied the path integral technique successfully to calculate the effective potential .",
    "we are able to regulate @xmath3 theory in 5d and obtain an expression for one loop potential . using the functional diagrammatic method , we calculated temperature dependent one loop correction and the critical temperature @xmath1 .",
    "we note that critical temperature in case of 5d field is dependent on fundamental mass scale in contrast with 4d case , but still symmetry restoration is possible , when effective mass squared becomes positive .",
    "we verify our result by calculating critical temperature from self - mass correction at finite temperature .",
    "the nature of phase transition is found continuous and is inferred as second order .",
    "the present results can be compared with dienes etal @xcite where they consider single extra dimension , which is compactified on a circle and it contributes a large number of kaluza - klein modes .",
    "our expressions for temprature one - loop potential and critical temperature are similar to there results , in case of a scalar field .",
    "the nature of the phase transition in this study is in concordance with there model @xcite .",
    "our result may find some applications in higher dimensional cosmological theories , especially in theories where one would work with higher dimensional fields rather than effective 4d theories where coupling constant would be suppressed due to planck s scale .",
