    "in polynomial dynamics , _ dynamic rays _ , which foliate the set of escaping points ( points which tend to @xmath6 under iteration ) , were introduced by douady and hubbard as a tool in their famous work on the mandelbrot set @xcite . since then , dynamic rays , and their landing properties in particular , have been an essential ingredient in the success of polynomial dynamics .",
    "one of the fundamental results in this area , which goes back to douady , states that each repelling or parabolic ( pre)periodic point of a polynomial with connected julia set is the landing point of at least one ( pre)periodic dynamic ray ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 18.11 ) .    in the polynomial case ,",
    "dynamic rays arise naturally as preimages of straight rays under the bttcher isomorphism at @xmath6 .",
    "when @xmath0 is a transcendental entire function , @xmath6 is no longer a superattracting fixed point , but rather an essential singularity .",
    "hence the _ escaping set _",
    "@xmath7 is no longer open .",
    "nevertheless , it has long been known @xcite that for certain classes of entire functions there exist curves in the escaping set which can be seen as analogs of dynamic rays",
    ". we shall refer to these curves ( which are also often known as _ hairs _ ) themselves as dynamic rays of @xmath0 to stress the analogy to the polynomial case .",
    "( see definition [ defn_ray ] for a formal definition of dynamic rays , and also below for the special case of _ periodic _ rays that is of main interest to us . )",
    "recently rottenfuer , rckert , rempe and schleicher @xcite proved that , for an entire function that is a composition of finite - order entire functions with bounded sets of singular values , the escaping set consists of dynamic rays and ( some of ) their endpoints .",
    "this provides us with a large class of functions where we can study the topology of julia sets by looking at landing properties of dynamic rays .",
    "this approach to the study of julia sets and escaping sets has been used with great success in certain families of entire transcendental maps like the exponential family @xmath8 or the cosine family @xmath9 .    to state the main question of interest to us ,",
    "let us begin by formally defining what we mean by a _",
    "periodic ( dynamic ) ray_.    [ defn_periodic_rays ] let @xmath0 be an entire function .",
    "then a _ periodic ray _ of @xmath0 is an injective curve @xmath10 such that @xmath11 and such that there is an @xmath12 with @xmath13 for all @xmath14 .",
    "the minimal such @xmath15 is called the _ period _ of @xmath16 .    as usual",
    ", we say that @xmath16 _ lands _ at @xmath5 if @xmath17 .",
    "a natural question suggested by douady s theorem and the results of @xcite is the following .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is a finite - order entire function whose singular set is bounded , and suppose also that @xmath18 .",
    "is every repelling or parabolic periodic point of @xmath0 the landing point of a periodic ray of @xmath0 ?    even for exponential and cosine maps , this question is still open .",
    "( for a partial result on exponential maps , compare @xcite .",
    ") however , schleicher and zimmer @xcite obtained a positive answer for exponential maps satisfying certain dynamical assumptions . in this paper",
    ", we generalize this statement , under similar conditions , to a much larger class of entire functions .    for an entire transcendental function @xmath0",
    ", @xmath1 denotes the set of singular values , @xmath3 the postsingular set , and @xmath2 and @xmath4 the fatou and julia sets of @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "( for definitions , see section [ notations_section ] . )    [ def_gf ] a map @xmath0 is called _ geometrically finite _",
    "if @xmath19 is compact and @xmath20 is finite .",
    "we can now state our main result . recall that @xmath0 has _ finite order _ if @xmath21 as @xmath22 .",
    "[ thm1 ] let @xmath0 be geometrically finite and assume that @xmath0 has finite order .",
    "then , for any repelling or parabolic periodic point @xmath23 of @xmath0 , there is a periodic ray landing at @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , the condition that @xmath0 is geometrically finite can be weakened ; what we need is that every iterate of @xmath0 has an `` admissible expansion domain '' at every repelling or parabolic fixed point ( see definition [ dfn_adm_exp_dom ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the assumption of finite order is not essential ; we require that `` all periodic rays exist '' .",
    "( see theorem [ maintheorem ] for the precise statement . ) by @xcite , this condition is satisfied by all finite compositions of finite - order functions with bounded sets of singular values .",
    "our result implies in particular that each singular value in the julia set of a map @xmath0 to which the theorem applies is the landing point of some periodic dynamic ray . using these rays",
    ", one can define a dynamically natural partition of the julia set , as done for exponential and cosine maps in @xcite , which is useful for studying the topological dynamics of @xmath0 in combinatorial terms .",
    "we remark that , under more restrictive function - theoretic conditions , our result can be considerably strengthened .",
    "indeed , if @xmath24 is a cosine map for which both critical values are strictly preperiodic , then schleicher showed in @xcite that _ every _ point @xmath25 is either on a dynamic ray or the landing point of a dynamic ray .",
    "in @xcite we generalize this result to any finite - order _ subhyperbolic _ function @xmath0 such that @xmath4 contains no asymptotic values and the degree of critical points in @xmath4 is uniformly bounded .",
    "( a subhyperbolic entire function is a geometrically finite map without parabolic cycles . ) furthermore , the julia set of such a function can be described as a `` pinched cantor bouquet '' in the sense of @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ? * definition 1.2 ) ) .    here",
    "the assumption that there are no asymptotic values in the julia set is essential : indeed , there is _ no _ exponential map @xmath26 for which the asymptotic value belongs to the julia set and every point of @xmath4 is either on a dynamic ray or the landing point of a dynamic ray @xcite .      in the case of geometrically finite exponential maps ,",
    "our theorem is due to schleicher and zimmer @xcite ( although in the case where the singular value is preperiodic some of the details are only sketched ) .",
    "this was extended to cosine maps with preperiodic critical values in @xcite .",
    "the general strategy of our proof , which we will now describe , follows the same idea as these papers .    by passing to a suitable iterate",
    ", we can assume that the considered repelling or parabolic periodic point @xmath5 is a fixed point .",
    "the idea is to start with _ any _ given curve connecting @xmath5 to infinity , and pull back this curve using iterates of the map @xmath0 . using hyperbolic contraction arguments , we prove that this procedure yields only finitely many different curves up to homotopy .",
    "this then allows us to associate a combinatorial object ( a `` periodic external address '' ) to these curves . when we know ",
    "from the existence theorems of @xcite  that there exists a periodic ray corresponding to this address , it then easily follows that this ray lands at @xmath5 .",
    "since the `` ad - hoc '' method that was used to obtain hyperbolic contraction estimates in @xcite appears to be difficult to adapt to our more general setting , we develop a rather natural construction using hyperbolic geometry .",
    "our argument gives a more streamlined proof even in the established cases .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the case when @xmath3 is finite requires less technical constructions than the general setting .",
    "this is why we consider this special case separately in the proofs of some results required for the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] ( see section [ sec_3 ] ) .",

    "let us pick a horosphere @xmath459 in the admissible expansion domain @xmath70 .",
    "recall that the preimage of @xmath459 under @xmath0 is a countable union of tracts , which we will denote by @xmath199 .",
    "moreover , each tract @xmath199 can be split into fundamental domains , depending on the choice of a curve that connects @xmath276 to @xmath6 without intersecting any of the tracts .",
    "let us fix such a selection of fundamental domains @xmath460 .",
    "it is necessary to give an idea of how to define an external address , which is respected by homotopies , for a leg @xmath75 .",

    "we can also assume that @xmath16 is eventually contained in a fundamental domain , say @xmath463 , and so are its images , since by the previous discussion this is true for all @xmath464 with @xmath465 .",

    "now , the tails @xmath480 and @xmath481 are both entirely contained in the same fundamental domain @xmath463 , hence we can replace @xmath480 by the ray tail @xmath482 , without changing the equivalence class .",
    "when we apply @xmath162 to the tails of @xmath16 and @xmath483 , then the resulting curves approach @xmath6 through the same fundamental domain @xmath463 , and the same holds for the following iterates . hence , after replacing a tail of @xmath16 by a tail of the dynamic ray and applying @xmath162 we again obtain a leg eventually contained in @xmath463 .",
