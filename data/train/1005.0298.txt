    "in a recent work  @xcite , blum and auroux proposed a new inversion algorithm for identifying the initial state of an observable system , based on the application of back - and - forth observers . noting that we have only access to a measurement output on a fixed time interval @xmath3 , the idea consists in proposing a first asymptotic observer for the system that will be applied in this time interval and a second one that will be applied to the system where the direction of time is reversed .",
    "these observers are then used iteratively to get a better estimate of the initial state after each back - and - forth iteration .",
    "if the two observer gains are well - chosen , so that the whole back - and - forth procedure induces a contracting error dynamic , one can ensure the convergence of the estimator towards the initial state .",
    "+ in particular , ramdani - et - al  @xcite have considered ( for the case of wave equations ) the theoretical study of this problem applying techniques borrowed from semigroups theory . + here",
    ", we consider a similar problem to  @xcite for a wave equation , where the initial conditions are known ( are zero ) and we are rather interested in identifying an unknown source term @xmath0 .",
    "let also @xmath4 , @xmath5 and let @xmath6 .",
    "we consider the following system @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents the state of the system and @xmath1 is the output . the term @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a fixed ( known ) frequency and @xmath0 is unknown , is considered to be an external force which varies harmonically .",
    "+ for any @xmath6 there exists a unique solution @xmath11;h^1_0(0,1))\\cap c^2([0,t];l^2(0,1))$ ] to and @xmath12 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 2 ) ) .",
    "it is moreover well - known from the work @xcite of yamamoto that this problem is well - posed in the sense that one can retrieve the source term @xmath0 from the measurement of @xmath1 on the time interval @xmath3 if @xmath13 is large enough .",
    "our aim here is to propose well - chosen observers which allow , using back and forth procedure , to retrieve @xmath2 from @xmath1 in the minimal observation time .",
    "more precisely , we prove the following result    * claim 1 * we can construct efficient observers for which the back - and - forth algorithm is convergent and which allow , using the measurement output @xmath14 over the time - interval @xmath15 , to reconstruct the unknown source term @xmath0 . +    [ rmq1 ] let us point out that since the spatial domain is given by @xmath16 , the minimum observability time is given by @xmath17 .",
    "note that , whenever the whole initial state @xmath18 is unknown , system is not observable . in order to realize this",
    ", one can consider the simpler case where the source term @xmath2 is given by only the two first modes of the wave equation , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the unknown scalars . in this case , becomes equivalent to two independent oscillators with different frequencies and with two unknown source terms @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , the output is given by a linear combination of the position of the oscillators .",
    "this six dimensional system with one output is not observable .",
    "however , if we know the initial state of the oscillators , the two parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 become identifiable .",
    "+ the back - and - forth estimator allows us to take into account this knowledge of the initial state @xmath24 of the wave equation . on the contrary , if we had only used a forward observer , we would have lost the information on the initial state of the system and therefore there would have been no reason for the observer to converge to the real parameters . + we prove the convergence of the algorithm using lyapunov techniques and lasalle s principle .",
    "one of the main difficulties comes from the fact that the precompactness of the trajectories is not ensured since we deal with an infinite dimensional system and we also have to use sharp mathematical estimates .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows .",
    "+ in section 2 , we prove the equivalence between and another system which consists in a system composed of a wave equation without any source term and an oscillator in cascade . here the unknown term to retrieve is the initial condition .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the proof of claim 1 and is divided in two parts . in the first one we study the well - posedness of the considered systems . in the second one we prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm .",
    "we begin with introducing the following system ,    @xmath25    @xmath26    where @xmath27 represents the state of the system and @xmath28 is the output . system - is nothing but a homogeneous wave equation coupled with an oscillator .",
    "the unknown @xmath2 is now the initial datum of the system .",
    "we have the following results , whose proofs can be found in @xcite +    [ prop0 ] there exists a unique solution @xmath27 to - with the following regularity @xmath29;h^2(0,1)\\cap h^1_0(0,1)),\\ ] ] @xmath30;h^1_0(0,1)),\\ ] ] @xmath31 moreover , @xmath32 satisfies the following hidden property @xmath33    and +    [ prop1 ] for any @xmath4 , for any @xmath34 , @xmath35 where @xmath1 denotes the output of system and @xmath28 denotes the output of system .    as a consequence of proposition  [ prop1 ] ,",
    "we will now focus on system - and provide well - chosen observers for this system in order to prove claim 1 .",
    "as we have already mentioned it in the introduction , we are going to prove claim 1 using back - and - forth observers .",
    "we first rewrite system - in the following way @xmath36 @xmath37 where , from above results , @xmath38;h^2(0,1)\\cap h^1_0(0,1)),\\ ] ] @xmath39;h^1_0(0,1))\\ ] ] and @xmath40 let us recall that our aim is to propose an algorithm which allows to retrieve the unknown @xmath2 from the measurement output @xmath28 on the time interval @xmath3 .",
    "our idea consists in designing a well - chosen asymptotic observer , which ensures the decrease of a same lyapunov function in the back - and - forth procedure . to this aim",
    ", we first make the previous system periodical .",
    "more precisely , we define @xmath41 on @xmath42 as the solution to the following periodical system @xmath43 @xmath44 for @xmath45 . using previous results",
    ", one easily sees that @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 indeed , the above periodic system represents the system - on the time intervals @xmath49 , and the same system in the time - reversed manner on the intervals @xmath50 . in particular , one has @xmath51 the asymptotic observer we propose is the following @xmath52 @xmath53here @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the observer gains , are strictly positive constants to be fixed as the design parameters . before studying the well - posedness of system - ,",
    "let us introduce the error dynamics .",
    "the error term being defined as the difference between the observer and the observed system , error equations are the following @xmath56 @xmath57      from now and until the end , we denote @xmath58 we have the following proposition ( see @xcite for the proof ) .",
    "+    [ prop2 ] for any @xmath4 , for any @xmath59 and any @xmath60 , there exists a unique solution @xmath61 to the following periodical cauchy problem @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath45 , with the following regularity    @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66    moreover @xmath67 satisfies the following energy identities : for any @xmath68 , @xmath69    and @xmath70where @xmath71 denotes a positive constant which only depends on @xmath72 .",
    "+    one easily sees that the well - posedness of system - in @xmath73 directly follows from proposition  [ prop2 ] .",
    "the well - posedness of system - in @xmath74 then follows ( using also the well - posedness of system - in the same space ) .",
    "the main goal of this section is to prove the following result , implying claim 1 +    [ thm : conv ] for any @xmath75 , @xmath76    _ proof of theorem  [ thm : conv ] .",
    "_ let us assume that - do not hold .",
    "then , there exist a positive constant @xmath77 and a subsequence @xmath78 with @xmath79 such that for any @xmath80 ,    @xmath81    from proposition  [ prop2 ] , @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84    and for any time @xmath85 , @xmath86 since @xmath87 is bounded in @xmath88 , it follows from kato - rellich s theorem that there exists a subsequence of @xmath89 , that , for convenience , we still denote @xmath89 , and there exists @xmath90 such that @xmath91 from , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are bounded , and from the fifth equation in so is @xmath95 .",
    "thus , ( up to a subsequence of @xmath89 ) , there exists @xmath96 such that @xmath97    let now @xmath98;h^1_r(0,1))\\times c([0,t];l^2(0,1)),\\ ] ] @xmath99 be solution to @xmath100 finally , let us define , for any @xmath80 , @xmath101;h^1_r(0,1))\\times c([0,t];l^2(0,1))\\ ] ] and @xmath102 by @xmath103 and @xmath104 for any @xmath105 . with such a definition , for any @xmath80 , @xmath106 is solution to @xmath107 from - and ( more precisely by continuity of flow with respect to the initial state ) , @xmath108",
    "we now introduce the following lyapunov function@xmath109indeed , @xmath110 and using and , one can compute , for any time @xmath105 , @xmath111 the function @xmath112 is positive , decreasing .",
    "consequently there exists @xmath113 such that @xmath114    on the other side , from , , and , one has , for any @xmath105 , @xmath115    thus it follows from and that for any time @xmath105 , @xmath116 in other words , @xmath117 is constant on @xmath3 and thus @xmath118 we finally obtain @xmath119 consequently , from the fourth and sixth lines in , we also get @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a real constant .",
    "then , using the third and fifth lines in and , and we see that @xmath122 consequently , reduces to @xmath123    we recall that if @xmath124 and @xmath125 , then @xmath126 can be expressed as@xmath127\\cos\\left(\\frac{(2k+1)\\pi",
