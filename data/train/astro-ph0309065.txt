    "2002 ) has also recently renewed interest in measuring the star formation activity at these epochs , since starburst galaxies can contribute a significant fraction of the ionizing photons ( madau et al .",

    "initial estimates based on the evolution of the cosmic neutral hydrogen mass density estimated from damped ly@xmath5absorption systems ( dla , fall et al .",

    "1996 ) seemed to confirm this general scenario .",
    "however , subsequent measures based on the systematic spectroscopic identification of hundreds of lyman  break galaxies at @xmath8 and @xmath2 showed that the star formation density traced by these sources , after reaching a maximum value somewhere between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , remains nearly constant up to the highest redshift observed with some confidence , i.e. @xmath2 ( steidel et al .",

    "area samples obtained with the subaru telescope ( iwata et al .",

    "2003 ) show very mild evolution from @xmath8 , although possible evidence to the contrary has also been reported ( stanway et al .",
    "2003a , b ) .",
    "measures based on photometric redshifts also seem to be in general agreement with a constant or mildly decreasing activity of star formation as traced by starburst galaxies up to @xmath10 ( thompson et al .",
    "2001 ; thompson 2003 ; fontana et al .",
    "2003 ; kashikawa et al . 2003 ) , or even suggest that the star  formation activity might actually increase with redshift ( lanzetta et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the current measures of uv specific luminosity density of lbgs come from the hubble deep field survey ( hdf , williams et al .",
    "1996 , 2000 ) and other deep , but relatively small survey made with _ hst _ ( bouwens et al .",
    "2003 ) or from ground  based surveys .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "surveys are limited by its very small area , and thus cosmic volume , which makes it prone to systematic bias induced by cosmic variance ( for example , s99 argue that the original result by madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) was , at least in part , the effect of cosmic fluctuations ) .",
    "the ground  based surveys cover a much larger area , but at high redshifts the brightness of the night sky limits the sensitivity to only the bright end of the luminosity function .",
    "unfortunately , lbgs are rather faint , with a characteristic magnitude @xmath19 at @xmath20 ( based on adelberger & steidel 2000 s uv luminosity function at @xmath21 ) if no luminosity evolution occurs between @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",
    "thus , one needs to reach rather faint flux limits , even for 8m telescopes , to account for most of the light from lbgs once the redshift exceeds @xmath2 .",
    "the goods / acs observations offer a good compromise , covering an area @xmath22 times larger than the combined hdfs , with much deeper sensitivity out to wavelengths of nearly 1 @xmath23 m than that of most ground  based samples .",
    "this makes it possible to detect galaxies with luminosity fainter than @xmath7 up to @xmath24 . in this letter we present measures of the comoving specific luminosity density over the range @xmath25 based on the stack of three epochs of observations in both goods fields , the hdf ",

    "magnitudes are in the ab scale ( oke 1977 ) , and the world model , when needed , is that of a flat universe with density parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 and hubble constant @xmath28 .",
    "the data used in this letter are comprised of the first three epochs of observations , out of a total of five , of the goods / acs survey ( giavalisco et al .",
    "they consist of eight mosaics , four in each of the two survey fields , and one in each of the @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31  and @xmath32  bands .",
    "each mosaic covers an area approximately 10x16 in size with a scale of 0.05 arcsec / pixel .",

    "( 2003 ) lists the relevant parameters of the data , including the sensitivity .",
    "source catalogs have been extracted using the sextractor software , and the procedures are also described in giavalisco et al .",
    "the catalogs used to select high  redshift galaxies have been created performing the source detection in the @xmath32  band and then using the isophotes defined during this process as fixed apertures for photometry in the other bands .",
    "we derive colors from isophotal magnitudes , but use the auto aperture  corrected magnitudes ( in the sextractor parlance ) to measure the @xmath32band apparent magnitudes .",
    "these selection criteria are largely based on our previous experience with lyman  break galaxies ( e.g. dickinson 1998 ; s99 ; steidel et al . 2003 ) .",
    "we have visually fine  tuned them based on the observed colors of stars and galaxies in the acs images , as well as on the acs synthetic photometry from galaxy spectral templates to reject most interlopers from lower redshifts , while efficiently detecting typical uv  bright , star  forming galaxies at redshifts of interest .    without a third band in the near  infrared ,",
    "it is not possible to use a 2color selection to define samples of lbgs at @xmath10 in analogy to what done above .",
    "instead , we have used the single  color threshold @xmath39 along with a non  detection requirement @xmath38 in the @xmath29  and @xmath30  bands to define our sample of @xmath10 @xmath31band dropouts .",
    "d03 discuss the selection and robustness of these dropouts in detail , including the use of available near  ir photometry as `` a posteriori test '' of the selection criteria .",
    "a number of galaxies meeting these criteria have already been confirmed spectroscopically to be at @xmath10 ( bunker et al .",
    "2003 ; d03 ; stanway et al .",
    "later on we discuss the implications of this different selection of lbgs on the measure of the specific luminosity density of the @xmath31band dropouts .",
    "we have included in the samples only galaxies with @xmath40 in the @xmath32band , and we have visually inspected each of them and removed sources that were deemed as not real , either artifacts or spurious detections ( estimated using counts of negative sources detected in the same data set ) . these amount to a negligible number for the @xmath29  and @xmath30  samples , and @xmath41% for the @xmath31  one .",
    "we have also eliminated from all samples sources with stellar morphology down to apparent magnitude @xmath32@xmath42 , i.e. where such a morphological classification is reliable . these amount to the @xmath43% , @xmath44% and @xmath45% for the @xmath29 , @xmath30  and @xmath31  samples , respectively . while the procedure bias our samples against lbgs that are unresolved by the acs , it prevents contamination by galactic stars . in practice",
    ", it results in negligible changes to the measured specific luminosity density .",
    "furthermore , while the vast majority of galaxies at @xmath46 have @xmath31-@xmath31@xmath47 , photometric errors scatter some of these galaxies into our selection window .",
    "thus , we have also purged the @xmath31band sample from photometric ",
    "scatter interlopers using a statistical procedure .",
    "we have used a bright sub ",
    "sample of field galaxies , for which the photometry is very accurate , as a template of the color distribution of the sample as a whole and estimate the contamination using photometric errors as function of magnitude derived from the monte carlo simulations in each band ( see d03 ) .",
    "down to @xmath32@xmath48 , roughly the @xmath49%completeness flux limit for unresolved sources ( see figure 4 of giavalisco et al .",
    "2003 ) , the culled samples include 1115 , 275 and 122 @xmath29band , @xmath30band and @xmath31band dropouts , respectively . with a survey area of 316 arcmin@xmath50 , this corresponds to surface density @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 galaxies per arcmin@xmath50 , respectively , where the error bars have been derived assuming poisson fluctuations .",
    "because no systematic spectroscopic observations of the goods are available yet , we have used monte carlo simulations to estimate the redshift distribution function of the three samples .",
    "the technique consists of generating artificial lbgs distributed over a large redshift range ( we used @xmath54 ) with assumed distribution functions of uv luminosity ( we used a flat distribution , see later ) , sed , morphology and size .",
    "we have adjusted the input distribution functions of sed and size by requiring that the distribution functions recovered from the simulations using identical procedures as for the real lyman  break galaxies match the observation at @xmath2 . in this way , both simulations and observations are subject to similar incompleteness , photometric errors in flux and color , blending , and other measurement errors . we have obtained the sed using the unobscured synthetic spectrum of a continuously star  forming galaxy with age @xmath55 yr , salpeter imf and solar metallicity ( bruzual & charlot 2000 ) , and reddened it with the starburst extinction law ( calzetti 2000 ) and @xmath56 randomly extracted from a gaussian distribution with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "for the cosmic opacity , we have used the madau ( 1995 ) prescription extrapolated to @xmath59 .",
    "we have used an equal number of @xmath60 and exponential profiles with random orientation , and size extracted from a log  normal distribution function , as described by ferguson et al .",
    "2003 , this volume , figure 2 ) .    for a given dropout sample ,",
    "the main output from the simulations is the probability function @xmath61 that a lbg with absolute magnitude @xmath62 at redshift @xmath63 is observed as having apparent magnitude @xmath64 .",
    "a commonly used technique to derive the specific luminosity density of lbgs in this case is that of the `` effective volume '' ( s99 ) , where the spatial volume occupied by galaxies with apparent magnitude @xmath64 in the sample is @xmath65 the comoving specific luminosity density contributed by such galaxies is then estimated as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the average redshift of the simulated galaxies that have been selected into the sample , @xmath68 are the number counts of real lyman  break galaxies observed with magnitude @xmath64 , and @xmath69 is the specific luminosity of one such galaxy if placed at redshift @xmath70 .",
    "the specific luminosity density is then @xmath71 .",
    "the method provides a relatively accurate estimate in the case of the color ",
    "color selected @xmath29band and @xmath30band dropout samples , regardless of the assumptions about the uv luminosity distribution function used in the simulations , because these galaxies are selected based only on their observed sed , i.e. redshift , with little dependence of their intrinsic luminosity .",
    "in other words , these lbgs have a relatively tight correlation of @xmath64 and @xmath62 up to the the detection limit .    for the one  color selected @xmath31band dropouts the @xmath72 method underestimates the value of @xmath73 , because in this case there is no tight correlation between absolute and apparent magnitude in the sample .",
    "galaxies with a given apparent magnitude @xmath64 now have absolute magnitude @xmath62 distributed in a much larger interval , because whether or not they enter the sample depends on both their redshift and on their absolute magnitude .",
    "specifically , the lower redshift bound is set by the color threshold , while the upper bound depends strongly on galaxy luminosity , as igm opacity suppresses the @xmath32band flux at higher redshifts .",
    "hence , the effective volume @xmath74 is overestimated ( unless in the simulation one uses the same intrinsic luminosity function fo the real galaxies ) , because in the simulations galaxies with widely different absolute magnitude are equally represented . in this case",
    "we have measured @xmath73 with a different procedure .",
    "we have done a @xmath75 minimization to find the intrinsic luminosity function @xmath76 of the simulated galaxies such that once inserted into the real images and retrieved their number count @xmath77 is best  fit to the number count of the real galaxies .",
    "we use a schechter function with slope fixed to the value found at @xmath8 ( adelberger & steidel 2000 , as00 hereafter ) , namely @xmath78 , and derive the parameter @xmath79 and @xmath80 from the fit . in practice , since our data only reach down to @xmath81 at most , the assumption of a fixed value of @xmath5 is a relatively minor one ( we verified that values in the range @xmath82 change our results by at most @xmath83% ) .",
    "the specific luminosity density is then simply @xmath84 , and for each redshift value this is computed using the corresponding sample s best  fit luminosity function ( a detailed description of the fits and of the analysis of the result is the subject of a forthcoming paper ) .",
    "we found the average redshift and standard deviation of the redshift distribution to be @xmath85 and @xmath86 for the @xmath29dropout sample , @xmath87 and @xmath88 for the @xmath30  sample , and @xmath89 and @xmath90 for the @xmath31  one .",
    "for each sample we have estimated @xmath73 at @xmath91   ( @xmath92 ) using k ",
    "corrections derived from a template lbg with the same uv color as the average one in the @xmath29band dropout sample .",
    "we have derived @xmath92 integrating the luminosity function down to the `` observed '' limit , i.e. the absolute magnitude that for each sample corresponds to an apparent magnitude of @xmath32=26.5 , and we have also estimated the ( relatively small ) corrections so that all the measures reach the same absolute magnitude , which we have chosen to be that of the b  band dropout sample ( @xmath93 ) . finally , when using the @xmath72 method , we have also estimated the magnitude  dependent corrections for light losses due to finite aperture photometry that we have derived from the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the top panel of figure 1 shows @xmath92 for the goods three samples derived using the two methods above , both the `` observed '' values and those corrected to the same absolute magnitude , compared to the measures at @xmath94 and @xmath95 by s99 .",
    "it can be seen that the two methods provide similar results for the @xmath29  and @xmath30  dropout samples , but differ for the @xmath31band dropouts .",
    "note that the luminosity function correction is relatively small for the @xmath30band dropouts , but increases for the @xmath31band ones , as the @xmath32=26.5 limit of the sample corresponds to a brighter intrinsic luminosity at higher redshift .",
    "the bottom panel of the figure shows the star ",
    "formation density as a function of redshift .",
    "for the goods points we have used the conversion factor by madau et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , namely sfr@xmath96 in units of m@xmath97 yr@xmath98  mpc@xmath99 ; the other points are from s99 , after conversion to our world model and correcting for the smaller range of absolute luminosity , i.e. @xmath100 instead of @xmath101 .",
    "both the observed values and those corrected for dust obscuration as suggested by as00 are plotted .",
    "the specific luminosity density of lbgs appears to depend rather weakly on redshift over the range @xmath102 . integrating down to @xmath103 , s99 report @xmath104 , while from the goods data we find @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 in units of @xmath108 erg s@xmath98 hz@xmath98 mpc@xmath99  ( 1@xmath109 error bars ) .",
    "however , while the points at @xmath110 are relatively robust , the constraint at @xmath10 is still somewhat weak , because it critically depends on the measure of the number counts near the sensitivity limit of the survey ( see d03 ) . for example , if we restrict the sample to @xmath32band photometry with @xmath111 ( roughly @xmath32@xmath112 ) then we found that the best - fit specific luminosity density drops down to @xmath113 erg s@xmath98 hz@xmath98 mpc@xmath99(@xmath114 2@xmath109 ) . at face value",
    "this is still a relatively mild drop from the @xmath8 value , a factor @xmath115 , smaller than the factor @xmath116 proposed by stanway et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , but the error is too large for the constraint to be meaningful .",
    "we note , though , that the @xmath18 point , which is more robust than the @xmath10 one and does not need as big an extrapolation down the luminosity function , is reasonably consistent with the mild evolution scenario , lending support to our best estimate at @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the result at @xmath10 depends somewhat critically on the apparently substantial amount of light contributed by the faint galaxies . to the best of our knowledge",
    "the galaxies with @xmath117 are real @xmath10 candidates . based on our color selection , the observed dispersion of colors of faint galaxies , our simulations , and the expected colors of galaxies of various spectral types",
    ", we believe that our statistical corrections to the contamination is adequate and is not introducing a major systematic error in our measures .",
    "the very good agreement with the measure by s99 at @xmath2 , which is supported by systematic redshift identification of the galaxies , adds credence to this assertion .",
    "the current spectroscopic identifications at @xmath10 ( bunker et al .",
    "2003 ; d03 ; stanway et al .",
    "2003b ) agree well with our predicted redshift distribution and also support this conclusion .",
    "the samples are still too sparse , however , to attempt a measure of the efficiency of the selection criteria and , thus , the contamination .",
    "clearly , the measure of @xmath118 clearly needs to be revisited with deeper data .    in any case",
    ", our measure at @xmath10 is in overall good agreement with other similar measures from _ hst _ and ground  based data ( bouwens et al .",
    "2003 ; lehnert & bremer 2003 ) .",
    "stanway et al .",
    "( 2003a , b ) report a factor @xmath116 decrease of the specific luminosity density , although this is also very likely in agreement with our resultof because they limit their measure to bright galaxies , i.e. @xmath119 . actually , a direct quantitative comparison is difficult because of the difference in the sample selection and the pronounced dependence of @xmath92 on the faint counts .",
    "these authors also use the goods data , but they base their source detection on single  epoch images ( we use a stack of three epochs ) , therefore necessarily reaching a shallower flux level and larger incompleteness-@xmath32@xmath120 . as d03 observe , this misses one of the galaxies spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath121 . ] . down to @xmath32@xmath122",
    "they find a total of 14 galaxies over 350 arcmin@xmath50 ( 0.040 arcmin@xmath123 ) , while to the same flux level and using their same criteria we find 35 galaxies over 316 arcmin@xmath50 ( 0.11 arcmin@xmath123 ) .",
    "also , note that they use the @xmath72 method to derive @xmath73 , which , as we have detailed above , underestimates the specific luminosity density for the @xmath31band dropouts .",
    "our measures are in good quantitative agreement with another deep , large ",
    "area lbg survey at @xmath18 ( iwata et al .",
    "2003 ) and also with surveys based on photometric redshifts ( thompson et al . 2001 ; thompson 2003 ; fontana et al .",
    "2003 ; kashikawa et al . 2003 ) .",
    "they differ from some of the photometric redshift estimates ( from the hdf ) by lanzetta et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who , after correcting for bias in the photometry due to the @xmath124 cosmological dimming , conclude that the specific star  formation density either remains constant up to @xmath10 , and then increases afterward , or increases monotonically .",
    "while we do explicitly account in our measure corrections for light losses due to finite aperture photometry ( estimated from the monte carlo simulations ) , we do not find as large corrections as those suggested by lanzetta et al ( 2002 ) .",
    "very likely , much of the difference is that our corrections are derived by requiring that the galaxy size distribution used as input in our monte carlo simulations is such that the output distribution matches the observations at @xmath2 ( this roughly corresponds to assuming that the sizes evolve as @xmath125 ; see ferguson et al .",
    ", this volume ) , while lanzetta et al.s corrections are based on the light distribution of galaxies at @xmath126 , i.e. at considerably lower redshifts .",
    "it is not known if the uv specific luminosity density of lyman  break galaxies at @xmath127 is a fair tracer of the cosmic star formation activity ( e.g. as00 ) .",
    "regardless , if the dust obscuration properties of these sources are similar to local starburst galaxies ( meurer et al .",
    "1999 ; calzetti 2000 ) , and do not significantly change over the redshift range @xmath128 , then our result can be rephrased by saying that the star ",
    "formation activity of lbgs decreases very mildly with increasing redshift , at @xmath10 being @xmath129% lower than it was around its maximum at @xmath12 , several gyr earlier .",
    "since lbgs are certainly sites of formation of a considerable amount of the present  day cosmic stellar mass density ( as00 ; giavalisco 2002 ) it appears that the onset of substantial cosmic star formation takes place earlier than @xmath130 , namely at less than @xmath13% of the cosmic age .",
    "finally , figure 1 also shows that there is an overall good agreement between the dust  corrected data points and the semi  analytical models by somerville et al .",
    "( 2001 , blue curve ) , and between the uncorrected data points and the predictions based on the observed evolution of the neutral hi  mass density as traced by dla ( which include the effect of dust obscuration ) at least up @xmath2 , where these systems are known with goods statistics ( pei et al . 1999 , red curves ) .    what is the number of hydrogen  ionizing photons expected from our @xmath131band dropouts at @xmath10 ?",
    "since the rest - frame uv continuum at 1500   is dominated by the same short - lived , massive stars that are responsible for the emission of photons shortward of the lyman edge , the needed conversion factor , about one ionizing photon above 1 ryd for every 5 photons at 1500  , is fairly insensitive to the assumed initial mass function and is independent of the galaxy history for ages @xmath132 yr ( madau , haardt , & rees 1999 ; haiman , abel , & madau 2001 ) . here",
    "we normalize the number of ionizing photons to the _ observed _ 1500   flux ( rest - frame ) , i.e. we bypass the need for any correction due to dust extinction .",
    "a comoving luminosity density of @xmath133erg s@xmath98 hz@xmath98 mpc@xmath99 implies then a comoving production rate of h - ionizing photons @xmath134 s@xmath98 mpc@xmath99 , or about 5@xmath135 photons per hydrogen atom per @xmath136 yr escaping into the intergalactic medium . here",
    "@xmath137 is the average escape fraction of ionizing radiation from the galaxy hilayers _ relative to the escape fraction at 1500 _. photoionization of intergalactic hydrogen requires more than one photon above 1 ryd per hydrogen atom , as extra photons are needed to keep the gas in overdense regions and filaments ionized against radiative recombinations .",
    "if @xmath137 is greater than a few tens of a percent , then our population of @xmath31 dropouts may contribute significantly to the uv metagalactic flux , and help to reionize the universe by redshift 6 .",
