    "super - earths are an emerging population of extrasolar planets whose masses and radii lie between those of the earth and the uranus / neptune .",
    "the nature of super - earths , such as internal structure and atmospheric compositions , remains almost unknown since there is no super - earth in our solar system .",
    "transiting super - earths are thus invaluable targets for observations to learn the nature of super - earths in details .",
    "gj  1214b discovered by @xcite is the first - ever transiting super - earth around an m dwarf which enables us to study its atmosphere through so - called transmission spectroscopy , thanks to the small host star s size ( @xmath17 ) . for the purpose ,",
    "a number of observers have measured transit depths of gj  1214b in various wavelength regions ( e.g. , ) , and have narrowed down possible atmospheric models proposed by theorists ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    among recent publications , @xcite reported various atmospheric models and compared them with the previous observations .",
    "they concluded that a hydrogen - rich atmosphere with a haze of small ( @xmath18 m ) particles is the most likely model for gj  1214b , however , they also noted that this is only valid if the rayleigh scattering feature ( a rise of transit depths in short optical wavelength ) claimed by in the optical @xmath19-band is true . @xcite also reported that if the short - wavelength result is inaccurate , then alternative likely models are ( 1 ) an n@xmath11 and water dominated atmosphere , ( 2 ) a solar - abundance ( hydrogen dominated ) atmosphere , with thick clouds at or above the 1 mbar level , or ( 3 ) a solar - abundance atmosphere with a haze of @xmath20 m particles . in those alternative cases , however , deeper @xmath10-band transits claimed by @xcite and are incompatible with the models .",
    "thus the discussions of likely atmospheric models are largely depend on the reliability of the results by @xcite and .",
    "motivated by this fact , we previously tried simultaneous @xmath2-transit photometry of gj  1214b using the sirius camera on the irsf 1.4 m telescope in 2011 @xcite .",
    "consequently , we did not find a deeper transit in @xmath10-band ; namely our result was inconsistent with the results by @xcite and , and instead support a shallower transit reported by @xcite .",
    "this result has raised the possibility of the alternative models by @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite recently presented new @xmath12- and @xmath21-band transits , which was shallower than the @xmath19-band transit by .",
    "their results were still consistent with , but also consistent with no rayleigh scattering ( water - dominated atmosphere ) model due to large uncertainty in @xmath22 .",
    "although the @xmath19-band result by could not be explained without the rayleigh scattering , the new results by @xcite raised fundamental questions whether or not the rayleigh scattering feature is actually present . thus the argument of the presence of the rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere of gj  1214b is still unsolved .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented new spitzer photometry and also conducted comparisons of various atmospheric models with all of the previous observations .",
    "they found that the best - fit model was one of the alternative models in @xcite , which contains 1% h@xmath11o + 99% n@xmath11 with a thick tholin haze of @xmath23 m particles .",
    "they also mentioned that a pure water model and a flat line ( no atmosphere ) model are still acceptable at the time of their publication .",
    "based on the previous discussions , we consider that remaining important keys to distinguish atmosphere models of gj  1214b are ( 1 ) confirmation of a rise of transit depths in optical blue region due to the rayleigh scattering , and ( 2 ) further confirmation of @xmath10-band transit depths compared to @xmath6-band ones . to address the above problems",
    ", we conducted @xmath1-band ( bluer than @xmath19- and @xmath12-band ) transit observations with the subaru 8.2 m telescope to confirm or constrain the rayleigh scattering feature , and also conducted follow - up transit observations in @xmath2-bands with the irsf 1.4 m telescope in south africa to check the transit depths in those bands once again .",
    "meanwhile it is also important to learn and estimate the systematic effects due to the stellar variability for implications of transit depths .",
    "previously @xcite reported @xmath24 mmag stellar brightness variability in mearth band ( similar to @xmath25 band ) with a period of @xmath26 days and @xmath27 mmag variability in @xmath21 band with a period of @xmath28 days .",
    "however , no independent confirmation of the stellar variability was reported .",
    "for this reason , we additionally monitored long - term stellar brightness variability with the mitsume 50 cm telescope at okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) in @xmath12- , @xmath29- , and @xmath30-bands spanning 78 nights to examine any systematic effect due to the stellar variability of gj  1214 .",
    "all the listed observations were conducted in 2012 .    in this paper , we report results of the above new observations and present discussions on atmosphere models of gj  1214b .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows , we summarize our observations and methods of data reductions in section  2 .",
    "we describe analyses of transit light curves and stellar variability in section  3 .",
    "we present results of our analyses and discuss implications of the results in section  4 .",
    "finally , we summarize this paper in section  5 .",
    "we observed two transits of gj  1214b with the subaru 8.2 m telescope on the top of mauna kea , hawaii , usa .",
    "we used the subaru prime focus camera ( suprime - cam : @xcite ) on 2012 august 12 ut and the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas : @xcite ) on 2012 october 8 ut .",
    "both transits were observed through the johnson - cousins @xmath1-band filter ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the suprime - cam equips a mosaic of ten fully - depleted - type 2k@xmath324k ccds manufactured by hamamatsu photonics k.k . , which covers a 34@xmath3227 field of view ( fov ) in total with a pixel scale of 0.20  pixel@xmath33 ( each ccd has a fov of 6.8 @xmath32 13.6 ) .",
    "gj  1214 was observed with the suprime - cam during 06:2010:10 of 2012 august 12 ut . the condition was photometric through the observations .",
    "the exposure time was set to 40  s and the dead time ( including the ccd readout time of 18  s and other setup times ) was about 29  s ( duty cycle of 58% ) .",
    "we took 185 frames in total with the suprime - cam .",
    "gj  1214 was located in the 5th ccd chip , named `` satsuki . ''",
    "we defocused the telescope so that stars have doughnut - like point spread function ( psf ) to achieve higher photometric precision .",
    "the typical size of the psf was @xmath34 pixels ( @xmath353  ) in radius .",
    "primary data reduction , including bias subtraction and flat fielding , and aperture photometry was carried out with a customized pipeline by @xcite , with a constant aperture - size mode where a same aperture size is applied for all images .",
    "the focas is installed at the cassegrain focus of the subaru telescope .",
    "the camera has a circular fov of 6 in diameter , covered by two fully - depleted - type 2k@xmath324k ccds by hamamatsu photonics k.k .",
    "each ccd has four readout channels and each channel has 512@xmath324176 active pixels .",
    "the pixel scale is 0.104  pixel@xmath33 .",
    "note that the ccds of the suprime - cam and the focas are different .",
    "we observed gj  1214 with the focas during 04:4607:08 of 2012 october 8 ut .",
    "the weather on that night was clear , but the observation started just after dusk and the first - half of the transit was occurred during twilight .",
    "the exposure time was 40  s and the dead time was about 22  s ( duty cycle of 65% ) .",
    "we obtained 130 frames in total with the focas .",
    "we again defocused the telescope and the typical size of the psf was @xmath36 pixels ( @xmath351.8  ) in radius .",
    "primary reduction for bias subtraction using overscan region was processed with a dedicated tool named focasred .",
    "subsequent procedures , such as flat fielding and aperture photometry , were conducted with the same customized pipeline @xcite as the case for the suprime - cam .",
    "we observed a full transit of gj  1214b with the infrared survey facility ( irsf ) 1.4 m telescope located in sutherland , south africa .",
    "the transit was observed during 19:2621:40 of 2012 june 14 ut .",
    "we used simultaneous infrared imager for unbiased survey ( sirius : @xcite ) camera for the observation , which is the same instrument we used in @xcite .",
    "the sirius camera is equipped with two dichroic mirrors and three 1k@xmath321k hgcdte detectors , which can observe @xmath6- ( @xmath37 ) , @xmath8- ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath10- ( @xmath39 ) bands simultaneously .",
    "the fov of the sirius camera is a square of 7.7 on a side and a pixel scale is 0.45  pixel@xmath33 .",
    "the exposure times were set to 40  s and the dead time of the sirius is about 8  s ( duty cycle of 83% ) .",
    "we obtained 163 frames on the night .    during observations",
    ", we used a position locking software introduced in @xcite . thanks to this software ,",
    "positions of gj  1214 s centroid on the three detectors were kept within an rms of about 2 pixels in both x and y directions .",
    "we note that stellar images were widely defocused so that the psf was spread to @xmath3516 pixels ( @xmath357  ) in radius .",
    "data reduction for the irsf data is carried out with a dedicated pipeline for the sirius , including a correction for non - linearity , dark subtraction , and flat fielding .",
    "the non - linearity correction enables us to work up to @xmath3525000 adu with @xmath401% linearity , which is sufficient for the current observations @xcite .",
    "subsequent aperture photometry was done with the pipeline by @xcite .",
    "we monitored brightness of gj  1214 for 32 nights spanning from 2012 august 15 to 2012 november 1 ( spanning 78 nights in total ) with the mitsume 50 cm telescope located in okayama astrophysical observatory , okayama , japan .",
    "the purpose of those observations is not for planetary transits but for stellar variability monitoring .",
    "the mitsume telescope is equipped with three 1k@xmath321k ccd cameras , which can obtain @xmath12- , @xmath13- , and @xmath14-band images simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the each ccd has the pixel scale of 1@xmath41.5 pixel@xmath33 and the fov is 26@xmath42 26@xmath43 .",
    "we obtained about 1080 frames per clear night .",
    "the exposure time was 60  s and the dead time was 3 s for all bands .",
    "we slightly defocused the mitsume telescope so that the target did not saturate in @xmath14-band .",
    "the psf extends about 24 pixels or 3@xmath416@xmath41 in radius .",
    "we note that the contamination from objects surrounding the target and reference stars are negligible , because there is no bright object around the stars based on the 2mass all - sky catalog of point sources @xcite , and we have checked that the psfs of the stars do not show significant contamination .",
    "data reduction and aperture photometry for the mitsume data are carried out with the pipeline by @xcite as with the case for the suprime - cam .",
    "first , we create dozens of trial light curves using different aperture sizes ( @xmath44 ) and combinations of comparison stars for each observation . for the comparison stars , we use such stars that are not saturated , nor variable stars , and in the same ccd chip with gj  1214 . on this occasion",
    "we convert the time system , which is recorded in the fits headers in units of modified julian day ( mjd ) based on coordinated universal time ( utc ) , to barycentric julian day ( bjd ) based on barycentric dynamical time ( tdb ) using the algorithm by @xcite .",
    "note that the time for each datum is assigned as the mid - time of each exposure .",
    "we find all the trial light curves @xmath45 exhibit trends at out - of - transit ( oot ) phase .",
    "the trends could be caused by slow variability in the brightness of gj1214 itself or comparison stars , changing airmass , position changes of the stars on the detectors , or high sky background , and so on .",
    "we then check the all trial light curves by eye and eliminate obviously poor - quality ones .",
    "second , in order to select the most appropriate light curve for each observation and its baseline correction model for oot phase , we adopt the bayesian information criteria ( bic : schwarz 1978 ) for our analyses .",
    "the bic value is given by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the number of free parameters , and @xmath48 is the number of data points .",
    "we fit the trial light curves with an analytic transit light curve model and various baseline models simultaneously .",
    "for the transit light curve model , we employ a customized code @xcite that use the analytic formula by @xcite , which is equivalent with @xcite when using the quadratic limb - darkening law .",
    "the quadratic limb - darkening law is expressed as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the intensity and @xmath51 is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the line from the position of the stellar surface to the stellar center .",
    "for the transit model , we fix the orbital period of gj  1214b to @xmath52 days and the origin of the transit center to @xmath53 bjd@xmath54 , determined by @xcite .",
    "we note that this assumption is justified by the fact that there is no evidence of significant transit timing variations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we also fix the orbital inclination @xmath55 to 88.94@xmath56 and the orbital distance in units of the stellar radius @xmath57 to 14.9749 , which were determined by @xcite and widely adopted in previous studies .",
    "this assumption is necessary to directly compare transit depths with previous ones .",
    "empirical quadratic limb - darkening coefficients for @xmath0-bands are adopted from ( specifically , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) , assuming the stellar effective temperature @xmath66 k and the log of the stellar surface gravity @xmath67 .",
    "these assumptions on @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the same as previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we investigate a possible systematic effect due to those assumption ( especially by the limb - darkening parameters ) later in section 4.3 . adopted stellar and planetary parameters are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the free parameter for the transit model is thus the radius ratio of the planet and the star @xmath22 only .    for the baseline model functions",
    "@xmath70 , we assume the following expression @xcite : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the normalization factor , @xmath70 is the baseline flux , @xmath73 are observed variables , and @xmath74 are coefficients . for the variables",
    "@xmath73 , we test various combinations of @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , where @xmath76 is airmass , @xmath75 is time , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the relative centroid positions in @xmath80 and @xmath81 directions , @xmath79 is sky background counts , respectively .    for each trial light curve ( using various aperture sizes and combinations of comparison stars ) and each combination of variables , we optimize free parameters using the amoeba algorithm @xcite and evaluate a bic value .",
    "we then select a light curve which gives the minimum bic value for each observation .",
    "after this process , we rescale the photometric errors of the data so that reduced @xmath82 for each observation becomes unity .",
    "we also estimate an effect of time - correlated noise ( so - called red noise : @xcite ) following the methodology by @xcite , and find the effect is not significant for the current datasets . for this reason",
    ", we do not further inflate the errors of the data .",
    "finally , we fit each selected light curve with the transit light curve model and the baseline correction function model simultaneously .",
    "this is to include systematic uncertainties due to the baseline model in the planet - to - star radius ratio @xmath22 .",
    "free parameters for the fitting are thus @xmath22 , @xmath72 , and selected @xmath74 .",
    "we present all the free parameters for the selected light curves as well as the aperture sizes used for aperture photometry in table  2 .    to evaluate uncertainties of free parameters , we use the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method , following the analysis in @xcite .",
    "we create 3 different chains of 5,000,000 points , and trim the first 500,000 points from each chain as burn - in .",
    "we set acceptance ratios of jumping for the chains to about 25% .",
    "we check the convergence of free parameters by the @xcite test ( the gelman - rubin convergence diagnostic is less than 1.05 ) .",
    "we define @xmath83 uncertainties by the range of parameters between 15.87% and 84.13% of the merged posterior distributions .",
    "the results are described in section 4.1 .      for the mitsume data ,",
    "first we eliminate data that were taken in high airmass ( over 2 ) and during predicted transit times .",
    "we then select one comparison star for each band that meets following conditions : ( 1 ) not a variable star ( confirmed by other comparison stars ) , ( 2 ) brighter than the target but not saturated ( @xmath84 stars for @xmath12 band , @xmath85 stars for @xmath13 band , and @xmath86 stars for @xmath14 band ) , and ( 3 ) gives a light curve with the smallest rms .",
    "the reason why we choose only one comparison star and do not use combinations of stars is one brighter comparison star is sufficient to achieve a good precision ( @xmath87% ) for our purpose ( namely , any combination of comparison stars do not give significantly higher precision ) .",
    "we note that we also confirm that our result presented in the subsequent section ( periodicity and amplitudes of gj  1214 s variability ) is robust to several choices of a single comparison star . in this process",
    ", we also remove outliers that separate beyond 3@xmath88 from mean brightness of each night .",
    "consequently we use 2646 data in total .",
    "we model the stellar variability of gj  1214 with a sine curve following @xcite .",
    "we assume the following expression for the stellar variability , @xmath89 where @xmath90 are the normalization factors for each band ( @xmath91 ) , @xmath92 are the coefficients for the airmass , @xmath93 are the semi - amplitudes of the stellar variability , @xmath94 is the time of zero phase , and @xmath95 is the period of the stellar variability .",
    "the free parameters are @xmath90 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 ( 11 parameters in total ) .",
    "we search best - fit parameters giving the lowest @xmath82 and largest @xmath96 compared to a null hypothesis by minimizing @xmath82 using the amoeba algorithm .",
    "note that we set a prior constraint on the time of zero phase as @xmath97 to make the fitting convergent . to estimate uncertainties ,",
    "after the best - fit parameters are determined , we rescale the photometric errors of the data so that reduced @xmath82 for the fitting becomes unity .",
    "we note that the error rescaling factors are 1.37 , 1.27 , 1.13 for @xmath14- , @xmath13- , @xmath12-bands , respectively .",
    "the uncertainties are estimated by a criterion of @xmath98 .",
    "in addition , we also conduct periodogram analyses to show that we get a unique period in the observing span .",
    "the fitting and periodogram results are shown in section 4.2 .",
    "table  2 summarizes the best - fit parameters and their uncertainties for each observation based on the mcmc analyses . as a result , we obtain the following planet - to - star radius ratios : @xmath3 ( @xmath1-band , subaru / suprime - cam ) , @xmath4 ( @xmath1-band , subaru / focas ) , @xmath5 ( @xmath6-band , irsf / sirius ) , @xmath7 ( @xmath8-band , irsf / sirius ) , and @xmath9 ( @xmath10-band , irsf / sirius ) . the observed light curves with the best - fit models for the subaru and irsf data are plotted in figure  1  5 .",
    "we also plot oot - normalized light curves in figure  1  5 for reference , although we fit the transit model and the baseline model simultaneously .",
    "overall , our observations indicate a flat transmission spectrum through @xmath0 bands .",
    "the transit depths do not appear significantly deeper in @xmath1- and @xmath10-bands than @xmath6- or @xmath8-bands .",
    "the current irsf / sirius results are consistent with our previous ones with the same instrument @xcite , again refuting the deeper transit in @xmath10-band .",
    "our two @xmath1-band observations with subaru suprime - cam and focas are well consistent each other , however , we should note one thing as follows . in the residuals of figure  1 ( @xmath1-band , subaru / suprime - cam )",
    ", we see a small bump in the early half of the transit .",
    "the feature could be caused by a spot - crossing event . if the feature is truly a spot - crossing event , we can learn what effect the spot would have on rp / rs by eliminating the spot region from the data . for this purpose , we repeat the mcmc analysis using such data ( specifically , data during 2456151.8194  2456151.8277 bjd@xmath54 are removed ) . consequently we get @xmath99 for this case .",
    "although the feature is well consistent with a crossing over a small spot ( a bump - height of @xmath350.1% and a time - scale of @xmath358 min : @xcite ) , we can not refute that it is a product of systematic effects .",
    "in addition , we should consider a possibility for a possible `` hot - spot '' ( plage ) occultation .",
    "such a event may occur in stars with strong spot activity such as gj  1214 ( see e.g. , @xcite ; colon & gaidos in prep . ) .",
    "for the current case , we removed only a possible spot - crossing region ( with upward residuals ) , but there is a more subtle dip ( downward residuals ) just after the possible spot - crossing feature .",
    "as plages are typically located around dark spots , the slight dip may be caused by a plage crossing .",
    "if this is true , the above radius ratio ( @xmath99 ) should be considered as an upper limit . as we can not decisively diagnose",
    "whether those features are real or not , the result with the subaru suprime - cam should be treated with caution .",
    "figure  6 plots the observed mitsume data and the best - fit sinusoidal models .",
    "figure  7 presents periodograms for the mitsume data .",
    "table  3 presents the best - fit values and their uncertainties for the free parameters .",
    "we obtain the lowest @xmath82 at the period of @xmath100 days with an uncertainty of @xmath101 days .",
    "the periodicity is a unique one ( no other significant @xmath96 peak ) in the observing span as we can see in figure  7 .",
    "the estimated semi - amplitudes of the brightness variability are 0.32%@xmath160.04% in @xmath14-band , 0.56%@xmath160.08% in @xmath13-band , and 2.1%@xmath160.4% in @xmath12-band .",
    "as we can see , the quality of the @xmath12-band data are relatively low ( compared to the other bands ) due to the faintness of the target .",
    "we thus note that the semi - amplitude of the @xmath12-band variability may be still inaccurate .",
    "those results are very similar to the previous results by @xcite , who reported 3.5 mmag brightness variability in @xmath25-band with a period of @xmath26 days and 7 mmag variability in @xmath21-band at a period of @xmath28 days .    to assess the significance of the variability , we calculate @xmath82 and bic values for both the best - fit case and the null hypothesis case ( @xmath102 and @xmath94",
    "are removed from the model , and @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 are fixed to zero ) .",
    "we find @xmath106 and @xmath107bic = 122.0 ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) .",
    "thus the brightness variability is significantly detected , and our mitsume monitoring independently confirms the stellar variability of gj  1214 .",
    "we caution , however , as @xcite mentioned , that the true rotation period of gj  1214 could instead be a positive integer multiple of the quoted period .",
    "since our monitoring covers only 78 nights , we can not exclude a possibility of a longer stellar rotation period .",
    "even though the true stellar rotation period can not be determined , the apparent stellar variability derived by our monitoring is useful to estimate and constrain systematic effects due to the stellar variability in the transit depths observed in 2012 . in figure  6 , we show the observing dates of the transits , i.e. , 2012 june 14 for the irsf sirius , 2012 august 12 for the subaru suprime - cam , and 2012 october 8 for the subaru focas , with vertical lines . since the mitsume monitoring started after the subaru suprime - cam observation , the phases for the irsf sirius observation and the subaru suprime - cam observation are extrapolated by the period of @xmath100 days .",
    "according to the figure , the brightness of gj  1214 is nearly peak at the irsf sirius observation , middle at the subaru suprime - cam observation , and bottom at the subaru focas observation .",
    "we have adopted some assumptions in our analyses as shown in table  1 .",
    "since any large systematic effects would affect discussions on atmospheric models of gj  1214b , we should check the robustness of our results against the assumptions . in the previous study ,",
    "we have already confirmed the robustness of the radius ratios against @xmath102 , @xmath110 , @xmath55 , @xmath111 , and limb - darkening parameters in @xmath2-bands @xcite .",
    "thus a main concern for this study may arise from the assumption of the effective temperature and corresponding limb - darkening parameters of gj  1214 in @xmath1-band .",
    "indeed , recently reported a new parallax measurement for gj  1214 that makes it appear that its effective temperature might be hotter than 3000  k ( 3252  k@xmath1620  k ) .",
    "thus the adopted value of the limb - darkening parameters might become a source of a systematic effect .    to learn the level of the systematic effect and a possible dependence of radius ratios on the assumption of the effective temperature , we repeat the mcmc analyses for the @xmath1-band datasets for following 3 test cases : ( 1 ) @xmath112",
    "is fixed to the value for @xmath66  k and @xmath113 is free , ( 2 ) limb - darkening parameters with @xmath114  k ( specifically , @xmath115 and @xmath116 : ) are assumed , and ( 3 ) limb - darkening parameters with @xmath117  k ( specifically , @xmath118 and @xmath119 : ) are assumed .    for the case ( 1 ) , we find @xmath120 and @xmath121 for the subaru / suprime - cam data , while @xmath122 and @xmath123 for the subaru / focas data .",
    "the derived @xmath113 values are almost consistent with the empirical value of @xmath124 , and the derived radius ratios are also consistent with the values reported in table  2 within 1@xmath88 .",
    "we additionally test an mcmc analysis with letting both @xmath112 and @xmath113 free , and find @xmath125 for the subaru / suprime - cam data , and @xmath126 for the subaru / focas data .",
    "those values are almost the same with the case ( 1 ) , showing letting one limb - darkening parameter free is sufficient for this kind of tests .",
    "based on this test , we estimate that the possible systematic effect due to the limb - darkening parameters is smaller than @xmath127 , and we conclude that our results for radius ratios in @xmath1-band are robust .",
    "we also note that the above radius ratio values with free limb - darkening parameters do not change our conclusion in the section 4.5 .    from the cases ( 2 ) and ( 3 )",
    ", we find an interesting trend between the radius ratio and the assumed effective temperature of gj  1214 .",
    "the derived radius ratios are @xmath128 ( case 2 , subaru / suprime - cam ) , @xmath129 ( case 2 , subaru / focas ) , @xmath130 ( case 3 , subaru / suprime - cam ) , @xmath131 ( case 3 , subaru / focas ) .",
    "namely , an assumption of a hotter effective temperature gives a larger radius ratio , and vice versa . among the assumed effective temperatures , the case for @xmath66  k seems the most consistent with the test case ( 1 ) , thus we do not change our main results .",
    "although identifying a reason of this trend is beyond the scope of this paper , this kind of tests for the systematic effect due to the limb - darkening parameters would be necessary in future studies , especially in bluer wavelength regions .",
    "unocculted starspots are known to cause a systematic effect on an apparent radius ratio ( see e.g. , ) .",
    "the systematic difference of the radius ratio @xmath132 caused by the stellar variability due to starspots can be written as @xmath133 where @xmath134 is stellar brightness variability at wavelength @xmath135 @xcite .    the brightness of gj  1214 in @xmath12-band on the two observing nights of the subaru suprime - cam and the subaru focas is different by @xmath352% based on the mitsume monitoring , and given that the semi - amplitude of the stellar variability in @xmath1-band is similar to that in @xmath12-band , a systematic difference between the subaru suprime - cam and the subaru focas observations is @xmath136 . however",
    ", this value may be too conservative , since the semi - amplitude of the @xmath12-band variability may be inaccurate due to poor signal - to - noise ratio , as we have cautioned in the previous section , and since it appears to be much larger than the semi - amplitude in @xmath21-band ( @xmath27 mmag ) reported by @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we also try an independent simple estimate for the effect of unocculted spots in @xmath1-band as follows .",
    "first , we assume the temperatures of the ( normal ) stellar surface and the spot region to be @xmath137 k and @xmath138 k. assuming the black - body profile for the emission from those regions , we search for an optimal spot coverage that can explain the semi - amplitude of @xmath13- and @xmath14-band variability .",
    "we find that a spot coverage of 0.73% gives the best - fit for those two bands .",
    "using this value , the semi - amplitude of the stellar variability in @xmath1-band is estimated as 0.88% and the possible systematic difference in the radius ratio is @xmath139 at most . in either case",
    ", we estimate a possible systematic effect on the radius ratio in @xmath1-band is as small as or smaller than @xmath127 .",
    "we note that the more unocculted spots exist , the deeper transits would be observed @xcite .",
    "namely the transit at the time of the focas observation is expected to be the deepest .",
    "our results shown in table  2 , however , appear to be inverse , but this is not significant when considering the uncertainties in @xmath22 for the suprime - cam and the focas observations .    for the near - infrared region ,",
    "if we suppose that the semi - amplitude of the stellar variability in the near - infrared region is similar or smaller than the variability in @xmath14-band from the mitsume monitoring , then the difference of the stellar brightness in @xmath2-bands is less than @xmath350.6% .",
    "based on this assumption , we estimate maximum systematic differences of radius ratios in @xmath2-bands are @xmath140 , which is well smaller than the observational uncertainties . on the other hand ,",
    "if we again adopt the same estimation method used for @xmath1-band , we derive the semi - amplitudes of the stellar variability in @xmath2-bands as 0.20% , 0.15% , and 0.12% , respectively .",
    "those values are consistent with the above assumption . based on the values , we estimate possible systematic effects on the radius ratio as @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "thus we conclude that we can neglect systematic effects due to unocculted spots in the near - infrared region within the current observational errors .      measured radius ratios of gj  1214b published so far",
    "are plotted with respect to wavelength in figure  [ fig : atmosphere model ] , which also shows the five best - fit spectra from the figure  21 of @xcite . as described in section  1",
    ", @xcite raised a possibility of a high molecular weight ( high-@xmath51 ) , vapor - rich atmosphere which predicts a flat spectrum , by showing that a @xmath10-band transit was shallower than those from @xcite and .",
    "the new @xmath143-band transit depth from the irsf sirius observation is consistent with the previous values of ours and @xcite .",
    "this does not mean , however , that another possibility of a low-@xmath51 , hydrogen - dominated atmosphere is excluded when considering extensive clouds .",
    "this is because both theoretical spectra of the high-@xmath51 and low-@xmath51 atmospheres yield similar transit depths at the @xmath143-band wavelength , as seen in figure  [ fig : atmosphere model]a .",
    "the @xmath1-band transit that we have observed with the subaru focas is significantly shallower than the @xmath19-band transit reported by .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the deep @xmath19-band transit needs a rayleigh - scattering - like feature ( the rayleigh slope ) in the visible to near - infrared wavelength region , which appears in the theoretical spectrum of a hydrogen - rich atmosphere with tholin haze ( see figure  [ fig : atmosphere model]a ) .",
    "in contrast , the shallow @xmath1-band transit is consistent with the model spectra for high-@xmath51 atmospheres without the rayleigh slope ( see figure  [ fig : atmosphere model]b ) . among the five best - fit models proposed by @xcite ,",
    "the model spectra for the 1% h@xmath11o + 99% n@xmath11 atmosphere ( with and without tholin haze ) appear most likely . while the solar - composition ( low-@xmath51 ) atmosphere with opaque clouds may also account for the focas @xmath1-band transit as well as the irsf @xmath2-band transits .",
    "in contrast , the low-@xmath51 atmosphere with 0.1@xmath51",
    "m tholin haze is inconsistent with the focas @xmath1-band transit , and the similar atmosphere with 1@xmath51 m tholin haze is also inconsistent with the irsf @xmath144-band transits .",
    "unfortunately , the result from the suprime - cam is inconclusive due to the possible spot - crossing event , as discussed in the section 4.1 . given the spot - crossing is real , the difference of the transit depths between the two observations ( @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) is about 2@xmath88 ( 1@xmath88 here is a square - root of sum of squares of both uncertainties ) .",
    "although the significance of the difference is marginal , the two transit depths appears to be inconsistent .",
    "one possibility to explain the difference is that the stellar activity might cause a temporal change in the amount of haze in the atmosphere . in the case of titan",
    "s atmosphere , it is known that the solar uv flux and saturn s magnetospheric electrons and protons contribute to synthesize tholin haze @xcite . when a close - in planet like gj  1214b passes through a stellar - spot magnetosphere , the production rate of tholin haze might be affected .",
    "a time variation in the amount of tholin haze might lead to the change of the @xmath1-band transit depths . in this case",
    ", some amount of a low-@xmath51 component should be present in the atmosphere of gj  1214b .",
    "although it is highly speculative , this possibility is worth exploring by repeated future observations .    whether the atmosphere contains a significant amount of water or not affects our understanding of the origin of gj  1214b .",
    "the deep photometric transit originally presented by @xcite suggests that gj  1214b contains some low-@xmath51 components .",
    "if the planet is completely differentiated , it must be enveloped with a low-@xmath51 atmosphere . within the context of the core - accretion model ,",
    "a hydrogen - rich atmosphere of nebular origin is the most - likely possibility @xcite .",
    "detailed modeling of the internal structure of gj  1214b @xcite predicts that the hydrogen - rich atmosphere constitutes several % of the planet mass to reproduce the mass - radius relationship for this planet .",
    "it should be also noted that recently @xcite suggested that cloud and hydrocarbon haze formation in the atmosphere of gj  1214b by ( non-)equilibrium chemistry favored atmospheric models with enhanced metallicity .",
    "the atmosphere of gj  1214b may have been subject to photo - evaporative mass loss due to stellar xuv irradiation .",
    "although the current irradiation level would be so low that the atmosphere will undergo no significant mass loss today and in the future , several studies advocated that a gj  1214b - like planet had experienced a significant removal of the atmosphere in the past ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the mass loss history is , however , not well - constrained , because we do not know the current intrinsic luminosity of gj 1214b , which affects the speed of the thermal evolution significantly .",
    "thus , we can not deny the presence of such a hydrogen - rich atmosphere theoretically from the viewpoint of the internal structure and evolution .",
    "on the other hand , absence of low-@xmath51 components in the atmosphere would give some important constraints on the structure and origin of this planet . to reconcile with the planet s low - density",
    ", one possibility would be that low-@xmath51 components should be incorporated in the interior ; for example , the envelope in the mixed state with water and h / he . giant collisions between super - earths or heavy secondary bombardments of volatile - rich planetesimals would be needed for such mixing to occur .",
    "such processes triggered in a planetary system would lead to form multiple planets .",
    "provided that this picture holds true for gj  1214b , we predict that additional planets should exist in the gj  1214 system .",
    "thus search for outer planets helps us to learn the formation history of gj  1214b .",
    "although our results have suggested that gj  1214b has a fairly flat transmission spectrum through @xmath0-bands , it is still difficult to determine one decisive atmosphere model . experiences have shown that broadband single - color transit photometry is not efficient to constrain an atmosphere model in the presence of starspots and the stellar variability .",
    "more effective ways to characterize atmospheres of transiting planets would be ( 1 ) simultaneous multi - band transit photometry using small - medium ground - based telescopes ( e.g. , ) , ( 2 ) multi - object spectro - photometry using large ground - based telescopes ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and ( 3 ) spectro - photometry using space telescopes ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". it would be important to observe the wavelength region where the difference of transit depths between the low-@xmath51 and the high-@xmath51 atmospheres is significant , especially the rayleigh slope ( optical ) region and around @xmath147-band region .",
    "in addition , repeated transit observations are highly desirable to improve the significance and to check possible time variations . as the ongoing ground - based transit surveys ( e.g. , mearth ) and",
    "the future space - based survey like tess @xcite will discover more transiting super - earths around nearby cool host stars , the current experiences for gj  1214b would become a good practice for the future .",
    "we have presented two @xmath1-band transits observed with the suprime - cam and focas on the subaru 8.2 m telescope and one simultaneous @xmath2-band transit taken with the sirius camera on the irsf 1.4 m telescope .",
    "our measurements of transit depths suggest a fairly flat transmission spectrum through @xmath0-bands .",
    "comparisons of our new results and previous observations with theoretical atmospheric models from @xcite indicate that the high-@xmath51 ( water - rich ) atmosphere models are most likely , although the low-@xmath51 ( hydrogen - dominated ) atmosphere with thick clouds may still account for the observations . as noted in section 4.1 .",
    ", our subaru suprime - cam data show a possible spot - crossing event .",
    "suppose that the spot - crossing is real and the data from the event is removed , our two @xmath1-band results are marginally inconsistent .",
    "it is slightly puzzling , but it may be simply due to unknown systematic effects , or it may be explained by temporal changes of transit depths due to the stellar activity and thereby time variations of haze amount . to further constrain the atmosphere model of gj  1214b and to check a possibility of the presence of time variations in transit depths or the rayleigh slope , more repeated observations described in the previous subsection ( section 4.6 . ) would be desirable in the future .",
