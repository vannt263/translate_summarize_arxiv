    "the first reduction games which have appeared in the literature are perhaps the lipschitz game @xmath2 and the wadge game @xmath3 ( both were defined by wadge in his ph.d .",
    "thesis , see @xcite ) .",
    "they are a special kind of infinite two - player zero sum games on @xmath0 with perfect information , and are designed in such a way that if player @xmath4 has a _ legal _ strategy @xmath5 in @xmath2 ( resp .",
    "@xmath3 ) then from @xmath5 it can be recovered in a canonical and fixed way a function @xmath6 from the baire space @xmath7 into itself which is lipschitz with constant @xmath8 ( resp .",
    "continuous ) .",
    "conversely , given a lipschitz with constant @xmath8 ( resp .  continuous ) function @xmath9 one can construct a legal strategy @xmath5 for player @xmath4 in the corresponding game such that @xmath10 .",
    "these games were introduced to study the relations ( also called _ reducibilities _ ) @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where for every @xmath13 @xmath14 the link between these preorders and the corresponding games is the following : given @xmath15 , a payoff set for @xmath2 ( resp .",
    "@xmath3 ) is canonically constructed ( see section [ sectionreductiongames ] ) in such a way that player @xmath4 has a _ winning _ strategy in @xmath16 ( resp .",
    "@xmath17 ) if and only if @xmath18 ( resp .",
    "@xmath19 ) .",
    "assuming the _ axiom of determinacy _",
    "@xmath20 , or even just the determinacy of the corresponding games @xmath2 and @xmath3 , wadge proved that both @xmath11 and @xmath12 induce well - behaved stratifications of the subsets of @xmath7 which have turned out to be very useful in various parts of set theory ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "some years later , van wesep defined , building on work of wadge , another reduction game , the _ backtrack game _ @xmath21 , but at that time it was not clear which should be the `` topological '' class of functions @xmath22 corresponding to legal strategies for player @xmath4 in @xmath21 .",
    "it was andretta who solved this problem in @xcite , by showing that such @xmath22 is exactly the collection of those @xmath23 for which there is a partition @xmath24 of @xmath7 into closed sets such that @xmath25 is continuous for every @xmath26 ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 21 ) ) , which in turn coincide with the collection of the @xmath27-functions by a theorem of jayne and rogers ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.1 ) for a proof of this last result ) .",
    "another reduction game , namely the _ eraser game _",
    "@xmath28 , was defined ( essentially ) by duparc in such a way that @xmath29 is a baire class @xmath8 function if and only if there is some legal strategy @xmath5 for @xmath4 in @xmath30 such that @xmath10 .",
    "finally , some work related to this topic was developed in @xcite ( although in this case there are no reduction games directly involved ) .",
    "having all these useful reduction games , it is quite natural to ask if one could also define reduction games for other `` natural '' collections of functions ( this question was explicitly posed by andretta in his @xcite : `` is there a wadge - style game for higher levels of reducibility , like @xmath31 and such ? '' ) .",
    "more precisely : say that a set of functions @xmath22 is _ playable _ if there is some reduction game @xmath32 such that for every @xmath33 , @xmath34 if and only if there is a legal strategy @xmath5 for @xmath4 in @xmath32 for which @xmath35 ( this notion will be completely formalized in section [ sectionreductiongames ] ) .",
    "clearly not every set of functions is playable : for example , the collection of _ all _ functions from @xmath7 into itself is not playable , as a simple cardinality argument shows ( the strategies for _ any _ game on @xmath0 are always at most @xmath36 ) .",
    "nevertheless we can ask the following :    [ question ] which ( topologically defined ) classes of functions are playable ?",
    "the motivation for this problem mainly relies on the fact that the presence of a reduction game provides combinatorial tools for the study of the reducibility induced by the corresponding set of functions  see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the first partial answer to this general problem was given by semmes in @xcite and in his ph.d .",
    "thesis @xcite : there he proposed a game ( called _ tree game _ ) which corresponds to the borel functions , and some other games ( the _ multitape game _ @xmath37 , the _ multitape eraser _",
    "game @xmath38 , and the game @xmath39 ) which correspond , respectively , to the functions strictly continuous on a @xmath40-partition , to the functions which are of baire class @xmath8 on a @xmath40-partition , and to the baire class @xmath41 functions  see next section for the definitions of these classes of functions . in this paper",
    "we somewhat extend these results providing a positive answer to question [ question ] for a wide class of subsets of the borel functions , and for @xmath1-measurable functions ( where @xmath1 is any boldface pointclass closed under countable unions and finite intersections ) : therefore the paper is in some respect unusual for a research publication in mathematics , as it mainly consists of definitions and of proofs that these definitions are correct . nevertheless , in the last section we will also provide some applications of these games which motivate our interest in this subject .",
    "the material of this paper ( except for section [ sectiongamma ] ) mainly comes from sections 2.2 .",
    "and 4.8 of the author s ph.d .",
    "thesis @xcite or is obtained via minor variations of the constructions contained therein , but for the reader s convenience ( and to avoid confusions ) in the present paper we have adapted most of the terminology and notation used in @xcite to the one already used in @xcite , with the following exception : because of the applications of reduction games to reducibilities for sets of reals given in section [ sectionaxioms ] , in this paper the payoff set of a reduction game will be defined starting from two sets of reals ( see section [ sectionreductiongames ] ) , whereas in @xcite it was defined starting from a ( partial ) function from the reals into the reals ( nevertheless , it is quite easy to see how to modify one kind of presentation into the other ) .",
    "the constructions we are going to present rely on a very general way of defining games for sets of functions which are piecewise defined , for sets of functions which are ( pointwise ) limits of certain sequences of functions , and for @xmath1-measurable functions : most of the proofs involve some sort of operation for games which allows to transform a sequence of already known reduction games ( representing some classes of functions ) into a new reduction game which represent the larger class of those functions piecewise in the old classes on a definable partition , or the class of the pointwise limits of the old functions .",
    "the paper is reasonably self - contained and is organized as follows : in section [ sectionpreliminaries ] we will fix some notation , while in section [ sectionreductiongames ] we will give a precise definition of what should be meant by _ reduction game _ and _ playable _ set of functions , and give some basic examples ( both old and new ) . in sections [ sectionplayable ] and [ sectiongamma ] we will prove our main results , showing how to construct new reduction games ( building on other known games ) : this will give a `` uniform '' solution to our problem for almost all sets of functions involved in ( generalizations of ) wadge s theory , for @xmath1-measurable functions , and for some other related sets of functions .",
    "in section [ sectionaxioms ] we will give some examples of how to apply the techniques arising from these games to the study of various reducibilities , and we will prove some relationships between the corresponding determinacy axioms .",
    "finally , in section [ sectionsmallness ] we will give the optimal condition under which constructions like those presented in section [ sectionplayable ] can be carried out : even if this technical improvement allows to deal with a strictly larger class of sets of functions , for the sake of simplicity we have postponed it to the last section because it complicates very much the presentation without adding relevant ideas for the construction of the new reduction games .",
    "in most of the applications involving games , one usually assumes @xmath20 ( or some other axiom of this kind ) and then uses the combinatorics arising from the winning strategies in the games under consideration to prove the desired results .",
    "however , @xmath20 ( and , in general , all known determinacy principles which are not restricted to the context of a small definable pointclass , like the pointclass of borel sets ) contradicts the full axiom of choice @xmath42 , and therefore in presenting new games and their applications one has to be careful and just use choice principles which do not contradict @xmath20 . in this paper",
    ", we will always work in @xmath43 except for section [ sectionaxioms ] , in which we will sometimes need the _ axiom of dependent choice ( over the reals ) _ @xmath44 and the axiom @xmath45 , that is the statement `` every set of reals has the baire property '' .",
    "our notation is quite standard and we refer the reader to the monograph @xcite for all the undefined symbols and notions . given two sets @xmath46 and @xmath47 , we will denote by @xmath48 the collection of all functions from @xmath47 to @xmath46 .",
    "thus we will denote by @xmath49 the set of all @xmath0-sequences of elements of @xmath46 , while the collection of the _ finite _ sequences of elements of @xmath46 will be denoted by @xmath50 ( we will refer to the length of a finite sequence @xmath51 with the symbol @xmath52 ) .",

    "let @xmath61 be the bijection @xmath62 .",
    "then we can define the homeomorphism ( where @xmath49 is endowed with the product topology of the discrete topology on @xmath46 ) @xmath63 and , conversely , the `` projections '' @xmath64 defined by @xmath65 : clearly , every @xmath66 is surjective , continuous and open .",
    "unless otherwise specified , in what follows all functions should be intended as _ partial _ functions , i.e.  defined just on some @xmath67 ( endowed with the relative topology inherited from @xmath7 ) , and not necessarily on the whole space @xmath7 .",

    "therefore for all the terminology and the results about these concepts we refer the reader to @xcite  in fact we suggest to keep a copy of that paper while reading that section in order to compare the various results with the combinatorial arguments proposed here .",
    "the unique modification is that here we will sometimes consider reductions from some @xmath67 to @xmath7 : given such an @xmath96 , a set of functions @xmath22 with domain @xmath96 , and sets @xmath15 , we say that @xmath46 is _",

    "as recalled in the introduction , the first examples of reduction games are @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath21 and @xmath30 ( defined in ( * ? ? ? * and 64 ) , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively ) , which represent , respectively , the classes of functions @xmath71 , @xmath73 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",

    "* theorems 3.1 , 4.1 , and 5.1 ) ) .",
    "here we just give a brief and informal description of the rules of these games .",
    "in @xmath2 , both @xmath134 and @xmath4 have to play a natural number at each of their turns .",
    "the game @xmath3 is a variation of @xmath2 in which @xmath4 has the further option of `` passing '' ( i.e.  skipping her move at some turn ) , but with the condition that at the end of the run she has played infinitely many natural numbers , i.e.   she has enumerated a real .",
    "the backtrack game @xmath21 is a further variation of @xmath3 in which @xmath4 can still pass ( with the same condition above ) , but even _ backtrack _ , i.e.  she can delete all her previous moves at once and start to play natural numbers ( or pass ) anew , with the restriction that in each run she can use this option only finitely many times ( this guarantees that at the end of the run she has indeed played some real ) . finally , the eraser game @xmath30 can be described in the following way : @xmath134 must play a natural number on each of his turn , while @xmath4 can either play a natural number or erase the last natural number which appears on her board , but to guarantee that at the end of each run @xmath4 has indeed played a real , we require that for each @xmath125 and each @xmath26 there must be some @xmath135 such that for every @xmath136 we have @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the sequence of natural numbers that @xmath4 has played ( after possible erasings ) when @xmath134 has enumerated @xmath139 . in other words , @xmath4 has to enumerate a real @xmath140 and she has the option of changing the @xmath98-th digit of @xmath141 at any time , but for each @xmath98 she can take this option only finitely many times .",
    "many other games ( both old and new ) can be obtained by modifying one of these games , for example :    * a simple variation of @xmath3 leads to the game @xmath142 , in which @xmath4 can still pass but _ at most _ @xmath143 times in a run ( this is also equivalent to requiring that @xmath4 pass for the first @xmath143 turns and then plays the rest of the game without passing any more[klip ] ) : as we will see in proposition [ theorlipstrategies ] , the strategies for @xmath4 in @xmath144 induce exactly the functions in @xmath68 ; * a variation of @xmath21 leads instead to the game @xmath145 in which @xmath4 can still backtrack finitely many times but is no more allowed to pass : legal strategies for @xmath4 in @xmath145 induce exactly the functions in @xmath146 ( which is a proper subset of @xmath132  see @xcite ) ; * another variation of @xmath3 leads to the multitape game @xmath37 defined by semmes in @xcite , which can be described as follows : @xmath134 has to play his numbers on a single rows , while @xmath4 has to play her numbers on a table containing @xmath0-many rows . at each turn",
    ", @xmath134 plays a natural number on his unique row , while @xmath4 has first to choose one of her rows and then either pass or play a new natural number on it , with the condition that in each run of the game she has to play an infinite amount of numbers on exactly one of her rows : by andretta - semmes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.1 ) , legal strategies for @xmath4 in this game induce the functions in @xmath147 ; * the game @xmath30 can be `` iterated '' by using @xmath98 eraser operators ranked with a priority in order to obtain games @xmath148 whose legal strategies for @xmath4 induce exactly the baire class @xmath98 functions .",
    "various other reduction games , like the multitape eraser game @xmath38 defined in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7 ) which represents @xmath149 , can be obtained in a similar way . however , each of these games seems to be strictly related to the particular presentation of the game itself , and therefore it seems difficult to guess which should be the definition of a game representing a more complex class of functions , like e.g.  @xmath150 , @xmath151 , or @xmath152 .",
    "in order to have a uniform approach to the problem of representing classes of functions by means of games , it is useful to first abstractly define the notion of _ reduction game _ ( see subsection [ sectionredg ] ) , to isolate some basic examples of such games ( like the already defined @xmath3 , or games representing class of the form @xmath89  see subsection [ sectionexamples ] and section [ sectiongamma ] ) , and then find some operations which correspond to the analogous topological operations used in the definition of the new classes of functions , like the operation of taking pointwise limits , or of giving piecewise definitions on a definable partition of the space ( this is done in sections [ sectionplayable ] and [ sectionsmallness ] ) .",
    "a reduction game is a tuple @xmath153 ( where @xmath154 is some symbol which identify the game ) such that @xmath67 , @xmath155 is a countable set disjoint from @xmath0 ( called _ set of moves _ ) , @xmath156 ( called _ set of rules _ ) and @xmath157 is a function from @xmath158 into @xmath7 ( called _ interpretation function _ )",
    ".    the rules of the game are as follows : @xmath134 plays elements of @xmath0 , while @xmath4 plays elements of @xmath159 , so that after @xmath0-many turns @xmath134 will have produced a real @xmath160 while @xmath4 will have produced @xmath161 ( @xmath141 is called _ complete play _ of @xmath4 ) .",
    "then we give the following two conditions :    1 .",
    "if @xmath162 then @xmath134 loses ; 2 .   if @xmath125 but @xmath163 then @xmath4 loses .",
    "if @xmath164 is a strategy for @xmath134 and @xmath141 is the complete play of @xmath4 in a run of @xmath32 , then @xmath165 denotes the real enumerated by @xmath134 while following @xmath164 against @xmath141 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath5 is a strategy for @xmath4 and @xmath160 , we denote by @xmath166 the complete play produced by @xmath4 in the run of @xmath32 in which @xmath134 enumerates @xmath167 and @xmath4 plays according to @xmath5 ( @xmath168 and @xmath169 are defined in a similar way for every @xmath170 and @xmath171 ) . a strategy @xmath164 for @xmath134",

    "for example , a function is said to be continuous if the preimage of an open set is still open , and this definition does not involve any other information on the domain of the function except for its topology",

    "such classes of games are said to be _",
    "parametrized_. with a little abuse of notation , if @xmath186 is a parametrized class of games we will denote by @xmath184 again the collection of all functions induced by the legal strategies _ in one of the games of @xmath186_.    let @xmath22 be any set of functions from subsets of @xmath7 into @xmath7 .",

    "finally , for @xmath188 we will denote by @xmath189 ( or simply @xmath190 ) the statement : `` for all @xmath13 , the game @xmath175 is determined ( i.e.  either @xmath134 or @xmath4 has a winning strategy ) '' .",
