    "spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) in @xmath2 nonlinear media is a well - known parametric process that allows the generation of photon pairs . in this process , the interaction of an intense pump beam with the atoms of a nonlinear medium mediates the generation of pairs of photons with lower frequency .",
    "the spatio - temporal properties of the down - converted photons depend on the specific spdc configuration considered as well as on the spatial and temporal characteristics of the pump beam .    in most applications",
    "the goal of using spdc is the generation of entangled photon pairs .",
    "however , the generation of photon pairs that lack any entanglement ( quantum separability ) , but are generated in the same time window , is also of paramount importance for quantum networking and quantum information processing @xcite . by and large ,",
    "separable photon pairs are not harvested directly at the output of the down - converting crystal @xcite .",
    "their generation in a separable quantum state requires intricate control of the properties of the down - converted photons in all the degrees of freedom ; namely polarization , spatial profile and frequency content . in most cases , the separability in polarization results directly from the phase matching conditions imposed by the specific spdc configuration chosen .",
    "separability in the spatial degree of freedom can readily be imposed by an appropriate projection of the down - converted photons into specific modes .",
    "using single - mode fibers is one example .",
    "this leaves separability in the frequency degree of freedom as a significant challenge to achieve quantum separability between the down - converted photons .",
    "although one can always resort to strong spectral filtering to enhance the quantum separability of the two - photon state @xcite , this entails a substantial reduction in the brightness of the photon source . in the past few years",
    ", several methods have been proposed and implemented to generate frequency - uncorrelated photon pairs without the need for strong filtering .",
    "for example , elimination of the frequency correlation of photon pairs can be achieved when the operating wavelength , the nonlinear material and its length are appropriately chosen @xcite , as has been demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the appropriate conditions for the generation of frequency - uncorrelated photons might not always exist or might not be convenient for a given application @xcite .",
    "the use of achromatic phase matching , or tilted - pulse techniques , allows the generation of separable two - photon states independently of the specific properties of the nonlinear medium and the wavelength used .",
    "this method employs the poynting vector walk - off exhibited by nonlinear crystals outside noncritical phase matching to modify the effective group velocity of all the interacting waves , therefore allowing for the control of the frequency correlation @xcite .",
    "this is a route by which frequency - uncorrelated photons can be generated @xcite .",
    "non - collinear spdc also allows the control of the generation of frequency - uncorrelated photons by controlling the pump - beam width and the angle of emission of the down - converted photons  @xcite .",
    "it is indeed possible to map the spatial characteristics of the pump beam into the spectra of the generated photons ( spatial - to - spectral mapping ) @xcite , thus providing another way to manipulate the joint spectral amplitude of the biphoton , as has been demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the combination of using the pulse - tilt techniques described above together with using non - collinear geometries further expands the possibilities to control the joint spectrum of photon pairs @xcite .",
    "another approach to control the frequency correlations is to use nonlinear crystal superlattices @xcite .",
    "the method presented here to generate frequency - uncorrelated photons is based on tuning the dispersive properties of the nonlinear medium itself by engineering the waveguide dispersion .",
    "the waveguide geometry allows us to enhance the source brightness and to control the dispersive properties of the propagating mode by tailoring the contribution of the waveguide dispersion to the overall dispersion . the use of bragg reflection waveguides ( brw ) based on iii - v ternary semiconductor alloys ( al@xmath3ga@xmath4 , al@xmath3ga@xmath5 ) offers several advantages over conventional materials such as a large nonlinear coefficient , a broad transparency window and mature semiconductor fabrication technologies that can be utilized to tailor the spatio - temporal properties of the generated photon pairs .",
    "although phase - matching ( pm ) in these materials has often been considered as challenging due to their lack of birefringence as well as their highly dispersive nature , one can take advantage of the different dispersive properties of the various modes the waveguide can support ; namely totally - internally - reflected ( tir ) modes and bragg modes . in this case",
    ", one can fully exercise a significant level of control over the dispersion properties of the interacting waves while operating at the phase  matching condition @xcite .",
    "this property has been successfully used to enhance the capabilities of brws for generating frequency - anticorrelated photon pairs with a tunable bandwidth @xcite .",
    "to even further expand the freedom of design of the dispersive properties , and thus broaden the set of possible properties of the generated photons , quasi - phase - matching , with the periodic reversal of the sign of the nonlinear coefficient @xmath2 , can also be used in conjunction .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that bragg reflection waveguides made of al@xmath3 ga@xmath6 n slabs can be tailored to generate photon pairs in a quantum separable state .",
    "quasi - phase - matching ( qpm ) of the core slab is used to satisfy the phase - matching condition , while the tailoring of the dispersive properties of the waveguide , enhanced by using different types of modes for each of the interacting waves , allows us to control the frequency correlations between the down - converted photons .",
    "the quantum state of the down - converted photons ( the signal and idler ) at the output face of the waveguide , while neglecting the vacuum contribution , can be written as @xmath7 and @xmath8 designate the creation operators of signal and idler photons at frequencies @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "@xmath11 are the central frequencies of the signal and idler photons , and @xmath12 designate the frequency deviations from the corresponding central frequencies .",
    "the signal and idler photons are generated in specific spatial modes of the waveguide as will be described later .",
    "the biphoton amplitude @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 are the longitudinal ( @xmath18 ) components of the wavevector of all the interacting photons .",

    "@xmath22 is a normalizing constant , which ensures that @xmath23 .",
    "the pump and idler photons propagate as a tir mode .",
    "the signal photons propagate as a bragg mode .",
    "the use of different spatial modes for the signal and idler enhances the control of the dispersive properties of the spdc process .        in order to get a further insight into the procedure to search for brw configurations that generate separable paired photons , we make use of the fact that the dispersive properties of the interacting waves are different and expand their longitudinal wavevectors to first order , so that @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 are the longitudinal wavevectors at the central frequencies @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the inverse group velocities . under these conditions ,",
    "the biphoton amplitude can be written as @xmath29\\frac{l}{2}\\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & &   \\times \\exp \\left\\ { i \\left[(n_p+n_s)\\omega_s+ ( n_p+n_i ) \\omega_i \\right ] \\frac{l}{2}\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] upon inspecting eq .",

    "notice that in this case , even though there is no entanglement between the signal and idler photons , the bandwidth of one the photons is larger than the bandwidth of the other photon .",
    "the quantum state is separable but the photons are distinguishable by their spectra .    to generate uncorrelated and indistinguishable photon pairs",

    "the optimum pump bandwidth for the generation of frequency - uncorrelated photons is found to be @xmath58 nm , for which k achieves its lowest value .",
    "the value of k can not reach the ideal value of 1 due to the presence of the side - lobes of the sinc function in the anti - diagonal direction and a gaussian profile in the diagonal direction that introduces a slight asymmetry ( see eq .  3 ) .",
