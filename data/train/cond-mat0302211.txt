    "the study of lattice quantum many body systems by the exact diagonalisation technique has proven popular at zero temperature ( @xmath0 ) where only the ground state is required , but it is of less use at finite temperature .",
    "the reason can be attributed to the different system sizes applicable , where for spin-1/2 the ground state can be found for up to _ n_@xmath130 lattice sites , but the entire spectrum can readily be achieved for systems only up to _ n_@xmath116 .",
    "the intrinsic difficulties associated with applying the finite - size scaling method on such small systems severely limit finite temperature applications . at @xmath0",
    "the continued fraction technique @xcite allows accurate calculations of dynamical correlations using only the machinery of the lanczos algorithm , but unfortunately this technique has not been extended to finite @xmath2 where mostly full diagonalisation has been employed . as well as direct applications of the canonical ensemble",
    ", there is also a hybrid method which employs the canonical representation of dynamical correlation functions but uses a lanczos basis to provide a set of orthogonal states @xcite .",
    "this method allows access to larger systems than are accessible to full diagonalisation techniques but to smaller systems than the current proposal , which does not need details of all the states even in the lanczos basis . in this article",
    "we extend the @xmath0 formalism to finite temperature by applying a _",
    "microcanonical ensemble _ approach combined with the lanczos method ( mclm ) that provides smooth predictions for dynamical correlation functions at least at high temperatures .",
    "the physical advance is to appreciate that in the thermodynamic limit the microcanonical ensemble is equivalent to the canonical one @xcite , but for finite systems this is much easier to work with .",
    "the statistical fluctuations engendered by the microcanonical choice are a drawback for small systems but become controllable for large systems . in practice ,",
    "as the finite @xmath2 calculations are much smoother , it is more natural to contemplate applying finite - size scaling than for their @xmath0 counterparts .",
    "the exponentially dense nature of a many particle spectrum in the bulk is the property that smoothes our calculations , a characteristic that is lost near the ground state where the spectrum is sparse .",
    "besides the computational interest of this proposal it is worth pointing out that , to our knowledge , no studies of the fundamental equivalence between the microcanonical and canonical ensemble for quantum dynamic correlations exist in the literature .",
    "thus this work is a step in numerically exploring this basic postulate of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics ; clearly , analytical studies are needed to clarify , for instance , the meaning of the microcanonical ensemble for a quantum system with dense spectrum as an average over a single quantum state ( or a narrow window of states ) and the finite size corrections inherent in this ensemble .",
    "in this section we will discuss how an arbitrary probability distribution can be used , under reasonable assumptions , to represent the canonical ensemble in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the choice of a ( unnormalized ) distribution @xmath3 in the thermodynamic limit can be examined by considering its laplace transform ,    @xmath4    where @xmath5 controls the properties of a distribution designated by @xmath6 . as examples , the following choices of @xmath5 lead to ,    @xmath7    the canonical ensemble ,    @xmath8    the microcanonical ensemble at energy @xmath9 ,    @xmath10    the  gaussian \" ensemble at energy @xmath9 and width @xmath11 .    if we examine the partition function @xmath12 , then ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the canonical partition function . the physical idea behind",
    "the thermodynamic limit is that the partition function becomes immensely sharp when considered as a function of state space and becomes dominated by the large number of states with the correct thermodynamics ; in practice fluctuating quantities can be replaced by their thermodynamic average with negligible error .",
    "mathematically , an integral such as ( [ z ] ) may be approximated in the asymptotic thermodynamic limit using the idea of ` steepest descents ' with negligible error ,    @xmath15    here @xmath16 is chosen so that , @xmath17    and the average energy at the desired temperature is crucial . for the particular case of the microcanonical distribution @xmath18 and we need to employ states whose energy is the thermodynamic average as one might naively guess .",
    "provided that @xmath5 has only a weak dependence on the system parameters , then the two partition functions are essentially equivalent .",
    "it is also clear that provided @xmath5 has the required properties that the ` steepest descents ' is a good approximation , then any appropriate ensemble will provide the thermodynamic limit , for a particular temperature .",
    "it is quite natural to employ @xmath19 where @xmath20 is extrinsic and @xmath21 is intrinsic , in order to limit towards the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "the usually studied quantities of direct physical interest are the dynamic structure function ,    @xmath22    and dynamic susceptibility , @xmath23 \\rangle , \\label{chi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 , the angle brackets denote a canonical ensemble thermal average and the commutator plays a central role in the linear response theory ( or kubo ) formulation of transport .",
    "the two quantities are related by the fluctuation - dissipation relation ,    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the inverse temperature .",
    "note that @xmath27 satisfies the symmetry relation @xmath28 while the sum - rule ,    @xmath29    makes it natural to consider the normalised to a unit area correlation function ,    @xmath30    we have presented the dynamical correlation functions in the canonical ensemble and now we will establish their form in the microcanonical one . starting from equation ( [ s ] ) and employing solely the idea that our distribution has a restricted energy @xmath9 we can generate a correlation function @xmath31 in the microcanonical ensemble ,    @xmath32    here , we have used the relation ,    @xmath33    ( @xmath34 a function of @xmath35 ) and a decomposition using the eigenbasis @xmath36 . the expression ( [ sm ] ) integrates to provide ,    @xmath37    that can be re - represented as the basic correlation in the microcanonical ensemble ,    @xmath38 ^{-1 } x_{-{\\bf q}}\\rangle .",
    "\\label{basic}\\ ] ]    notice that this expression is exact in the zero temperature limit where the expectation value is to be taken over the ground state wavefunction .",
    "now let us imagine that we could find a single eigenstate at will , with an energy arbitrarily close ( in the thermodynamic limit ) to a target energy , @xmath9 say .",
    "it is in principle straightforward then to determine    @xmath39 ^{-1 }   x_{-{\\bf q}}\\mid * \\rangle,\\ ] ]    exactly as before , where @xmath40 is the known eigenstate with @xmath41 .",
    "if the microcanonical ensemble is equivalent to the canonical ensemble and if a single eigenstate is representative of the microcanonical one , then provided that @xmath18 for the desired temperature , we can expect that    @xmath42    in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this amounts to the physical idea behind our calculations .",
    "furthermore , from ( [ fd ] ) , it follows that    @xmath43    and from the symmetry of @xmath44 in the canonical ensemble we can deduce that ,    @xmath45    this relation then provides an alternative , cross - checking technique for determining the temperature for a particular value of @xmath20 .",
    "although we might like to believe that a single eigenstate corresponds to the microcanonical ensemble , based on a putative ergodicity assumption for the eigenstate , in practice it is not possible to find such an eigenstate .",
    "so we relax the eigenstate hypothesis and go back to a distribution of eigenstates close to the desired value @xmath9 .",
    "we simply use the formalism as though we had such an eigenstate .",
    "in principle we must construct a particular eigenstate with energy @xmath9 that equals the canonical expectation value of the energy , @xmath46 , at the desired temperature . in practice",
    ", we employ the well known lanczos algorithm that is an efficient way of diagonalising large hamiltonians using as variational subspace ( truncated basis ) the set of states ,    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is a ( usually random ) initial state and @xmath49 the number of lanczos steps . to obtain an eigenstate close to energy",
    "@xmath20 one might expect to use the closest eigenstate to @xmath20 in the truncated basis , but this is totally incorrect . in practice ,",
    "only the states at the edge of the spectrum converge and the other ` eigenstates ' in the truncated subspace have the suggested energies but are usually far from eigenstates .    in order to apply the lanczos method idea",
    ", one can simply push the energetic region of interest to the edge of the spectrum by choosing an appropriate new operator .",
    "one natural choice is to use ,    @xmath50    which is positive definite and pushes the eigenstates with energy close to @xmath20 towards the minimal , zero , eigenvalue of @xmath51 .",
    "another way to understand this technique is to consider expanding the ground state of @xmath51 , that we will call @xmath52 , as a probability distribution over eigenstates .",
    "choosing @xmath9 establishes the appropriate mean for this distribution but minimising @xmath51 corresponds to minimising the variance of the distribution , and consequently localising the distribution near @xmath20 .",
    "one can perform a lanczos calculation based upon the operator @xmath51 or , more efficiently , one can evaluate the operator @xmath51 ( now a pentadiagonal matrix ) in a previously constructed lanczos basis using @xmath35 (  l - projection \" method ) . note that ,    @xmath53    ( the expectation value is over @xmath52 ) and so a small variance guarantees a narrow distribution of energies around @xmath9 .    in any lanczos calculation",
    "the mathematical orthogonality between states becomes lost at some stage as numerical errors build up . in practice",
    "only the well - separated converged states suffer from this disease and for us these states , which are at the edge of the spectrum , do not gain any significant weight in the correlation functions and so do not manifest in our results . the states at low frequency are all well behaved and maintain their orthogonality .",
    "it is straightforward to implement these ideas numerically , with a ` double - lanczos ' calculation ; the first run through a lanczos procedure of @xmath54 steps is employing the operator @xmath51 starting from a random state and it is used to find the state @xmath55 which plays the role of the microcanonical distribution .",
    "the second run of @xmath56 steps through lanczos is made using @xmath57 as the initial state and then the resulting tridiagonal matrix can be diagonalised to form the dynamical correlations directly or by employing the continued fractions method which is numerically more efficient but introduces a loss of resolution .",
    "all the analysis so far has been subject to several caveats ; firstly , that the microcanonical ensemble is equivalent to the canonical one in the thermodynamic limit and in the context of quantum dynamic correlations .",
    "secondly , that a single eigenstate is equivalent to the microcanonical ensemble and thirdly that we can find such an eigenstate at will . the first two assumptions , as we have mentioned in the introduction , should be the focus of analytical studies as fundamental issues of nonequibrium statistical mechanics .    regarding the third assumption , it is clearly problematic as it is well known that although the lanczos method converges quite easily at the sparse edges of the spectrum , in the denser inner regions of the spectrum , of interest at finite temperature , it takes the lanczos procedure an exponentially large number of iterations to converge .",
    "a many - body spectrum has an exponential number of states , e.g. for spin-1/2 the # ( states)@xmath58 , and for a bounded hamiltonian the eigenstates are compressed into an energy region that grows only linearly with system size . although the low energy region maintains a sparse density of states , the eigenstates become exponentially close together in the area of interest and essentially become unattainable .    at first sight",
    "this appears an insurmountable difficulty , but in practice this issue allows the technique its success .",
    "the first lanczos procedure provides a single quantum state @xmath55 , that is not an eigenstate , but which when decomposed in an eigenstate basis , it is represented by a narrow distribution @xmath59 around @xmath9 ;    @xmath60    gives for the expectation value of an operator @xmath61 ,    @xmath62    this state , used in the evaluation of expectation values , acts as a statistical average over an energy window .",
    "it is important to notice , that by employing a single quantum state ( not eigenstate ) for evaluating an expectation value ( as a substitute for a statistical average over a narrow energy window of eigenstates ) , we assume that the appearing off - diagonal terms ( second term in eq.([rpa ] ) ) cancel each other",
    ". this assumption can be justified ( and numerically verified ) by invoking a random phase decomposition of the used quantum state .    from this discussion",
    "we can expect two types of fluctuations in the obtained spectra ; first , intrinsic fluctuations due to the finite size of the system , present even when a single eigenstate is used for the evaluation of the expectation value .",
    "second , statistical fluctuations entering by the off - diagonal terms in eq .",
    "( [ rpa ] ) due to the use of a single pure state that is not an eigenstate ; this type of fluctuations can be reduced by averaging over orthogonal states @xmath55 ( e.g. corresponding to different translational symmetry @xmath63 subspaces as we will show below ) .",
    "in the following we present a test on the rate of convergence of the projection to a single quantum state with energy close to @xmath9 . due to the innate complexity of an implicit scheme like lanczos",
    ", we develop the theory of a simpler technique briefly to exhibit the ideas .",
    "a rather simple method of numerically solving for the ground state is by an iterative sequence of applications of the scaled hamiltonian . for us",
    "this amounts to iterative applications of the operator ,    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is chosen to be large enough so that @xmath66 for the full spectrum . repeated applications of this operator exponentially suppresses all states except those for which @xmath67 which remain unaffected . we can start out with a set of random states and then for @xmath68 applications of our operator we can build a distribution ,    @xmath69 \\langle \\psi \\mid p^m\\ ] ]    ( @xmath70 is the step function ) and if we were to perform an average over an orthogonal basis , @xmath71 , then this would converge to ,    @xmath72 p^{2m}.\\ ] ]    elementary analysis provides :    @xmath73 ( 2m)!2^{2m}2\\mu   \\left[\\frac{1}{x}\\frac{d}{dx}\\right]^{2 m } \\frac{\\sinh x}{x}\\vert _ { x=\\beta \\mu } .\\ ] ]    in the limit that @xmath74 we find that ,    @xmath75    and we converge to a narrow gaussian probability distribution ,    @xmath76.\\ ] ]    the width of this distribution is under our control ,    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the natural energy scale for the model and we see that @xmath68 needs to scale with the square of the system size @xmath79 to maintain resolution .",
    "the lanczos method is clearly much more sophisticated and provides a much narrower distribution .",
    "we have examined the distribution obtained in a lanczos calculation and we find that it is well represented by a gaussian distribution with a variance controlled by the ` eigenvalue ' of @xmath51 attained by the calculation . in practice",
    "this is about two orders of magnitude better in energy than the result obtained from the projection analysis ( eq.([p ] ) ) , which however it is analytically controllable ; indeed , we find that the lanczos method scales as @xmath80 so that the intrinsic resolution , @xmath81 , is inversely proportional to the number of iterations .",

    "the degree of convergence can be measured using the eventual ` eigenvalue ' of @xmath51 ; it plays the role of the variance of the chosen distribution and its square - root is an intrinsic energy resolution @xmath11 .",
    "this scale , @xmath84 , can never drop below the distance to the nearest eigenvalue . for a usual size system , e.g. @xmath85 , and temperature ,",
    "this limit is unattainable but a resolution of @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) is readily available with a thousand or so @xmath54 iterations .",
    "once one has found this state @xmath88 , that plays the role of the state @xmath89 , a second lanczos projection sequence is generated employing the state @xmath90 as the initial state .",
    "the resolution of the eventual result is controlled by the intrinsic dependence on the microcanonical ensemble and the degree of convergence measured by @xmath11 .",
    "this can be seen from relation ( [ basic ] ) as the eigenstates over which the state @xmath91 is decomposed have a spread in energy @xmath11 with respect to the reference energy @xmath9 .",
    "the resolution also depends on the convergence achieved in the 2nd lanczos procedure where the number of iterations @xmath56 denotes the finite number of poles which are used to try to represent the dynamical correlations . at the sparse edges of the spectrum",
    "these poles denote the eigenvalues of the system but in the bulk of the spectrum , when grouped into bins of a given frequency width , they are fairly uniformly spread and offer a further natural energy resolution for the calculation .",
    "more lanczos steps provide more poles and a finer spectral ` grid ' for the correlation functions , until the graininess of the real system is achieved .",
    "we have elected to use a few thousand poles in our calculations with very little improvement obtained by increasing this number as we shall see .",
    "the final resolution is self - imposed and is the @xmath92 of ( [ basic ] ) which we choose to be of order of the spectral grid in order to smooth our calculations .",
    "we are now in a position to test our proposed technique and uncover its strengths and weaknesses .",
    "we have chosen to investigate the finite temperature dynamics of the prototype spin-1/2 heisenberg model ( equivalent to the fermionic  @xmath93 \" model ) .",
    "this choice was dictated by its central role in low dimensional quantum magnetism ; an exact solution of the thermodynamics and elementary excitations is known using the bethe ansatz method @xcite , the spin dynamics probed by nmr is of current experimental interest @xcite and several numerical and analytical studied have been devoted to the study of finite temperature dynamic correlations @xcite .",

    "our investigation appears to validate the use of the lanczos algorithm to analyse finite temperature dynamical properties of strongly correlated systems ; the crucial step is to employ the microcanonical ensemble , which essentially allows the thermodynamic average to be replaced by an elementary expectation value .",
    "all the simplicity of the zero temperature formalism can then be taken over to the finite temperature calculation .",
    "the comparison of canonical with microcanonical procedures indicates that the thermodynamic limit is reached with quite modest system sizes and consequently there appears to be little systematic error coming from our choice of ensemble .",
    "there are intrinsic statistical fluctuations in our calculations but these are severely curtailed by increasing the system size and are an implicit difficulty with canonical calculations too .",
    "we believe that we can calculate the high enough temperature dynamical correlations for a finite system with an excellent tolerance .",
    "the statistical fluctuations in our results require to be controlled if an error analysis is to be contemplated .",
    "although we have not got analytical control , we do have experience at various approaches to reducing the statistical fluctuations .",
    "the crucial point is that , when taking a statistical average , one should use  orthogonal \" states ( @xmath88 s decomposed into different sets of eigenstates @xmath164 ) . averaging over random starting vectors in the same subspace is not very effective , even if they are originally orthogonal , because the resulting distribution involves the same states and consequently an overlap .",
    "performing a @xmath63 average , over translational symmetry subspaces , is an excellent procedure , since the states are automatically orthogonal and intellectually one is reverting back towards the real physical statistical average .",
    "another possibility is to use several of the eigenstates of the first lanczos procedure ; although the orthogonality is guaranteed , there is an induced loss in resolution due to the larger @xmath84 s of the higher lanczos states .",
    "a final possibility is to employ the parameter @xmath9 , where the average over different @xmath9 s must be limited within a window that corresponds to the energy fluctuations at the studied temperature in the given size system .",
    "providing that the @xmath9 s are further apart than the chosen @xmath11 , the orthogonality is essentially guaranteed .",
    "although we believe we have access to the temperature behaviour of finite - size systems , this does not give immediate access to the dynamics in the thermodynamic limit because finite - size scaling must be performed ; figure 6 exhibits clear peaks of unknown form , plausible ` cusps ' and regions where the correlations vanish .",
    "unless we can guess or deduce the form of these structures , finite - size scaling appears problematic .",
    "we should note however from our experience , that not all models and dynamic correlations exhibit so involved spectra ; in forthcoming works we will present analysis of charge / spin / energy current correlations for other ( non- ) integrable systems of current interest ( higher spin , ladder models ) where the obtained spectra are far more structrurless .",
    "finally , besides the finite frequency behavior , our method allows the reliable study of scalar quantities as the drude weight .",
