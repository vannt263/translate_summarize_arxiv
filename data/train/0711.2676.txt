    "eclipsing binaries are known as ideal cosmic laboratories for studying the properties of stars .",
    "one method is the period analysis of these systems . in some cases",
    "there is a possibility of detection of other bodies in these systems using this method .",
    "but the @xmath3 diagrams have to show periodic oscillations with well - defined shapes , sufficiently large amplitudes and adequately long periods .",
    "very short periods have only small amplitudes and the long periods are not well covered with data yet .",
    "all these conditions and the accuracy of our data set have to be considered for the limitations of our proposed hypothesis of the light - time effect .",
    "the light - time effect ( hereafter lite ) , caused by the orbital motion of the eclipsing pair around the barycenter of the multiple system , was explained by irwin ( 1959 ) and its necessary criteria have been listed by friebos - conde & hertzeg ( 1973 ) and also by mayer ( 1990 ) .",
    "presence of a third body in the system is possible only if the times of minimum , also the secondary ones , behave in agreement with a theoretical lite curve , the resultant mass function has reasonable value and corresponding variations in radial velocities are measured . during the last decade also a confirmation by astrometry seems to be plausible .",
    "but regrettably in both investigated systems ( ew lyr and iv cas ) no photometric or spectroscopic study was performed , so these lite systems are still only hypothetic , because of no other confirmation of the lite .",
    "but there is still a possible explanation of this variations in minima times by another phenomenon , such as magnetic activity .",
    "we discuss this possibility later .",
    "in both cases we have calculated new light elements of the eclipsing pair and also the parameters of the third body orbit .",
    "their @xmath4 diagrams are shown in the figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "the curves represent computed light - time effect caused by the third bodies with parameters given in table  2 below .",
    "the individual primary and secondary minima are denoted by dots and circles , respectively .",
    "larger symbols correspond to the photoelectric or ccd measurements which were given higher weights in our computations .    for the computation we used the least - squares method .",
    "all data were found in published papers .",
    "table 2 presents our results , where @xmath5 are masses of components , @xmath6 computed period of the unresolved body , @xmath7 semiamplitude of lite , @xmath8 eccentricity , @xmath9 length of periastron , @xmath10 computed mass function and @xmath11 minimum mass ( for @xmath12 = 90@xmath13 ) of the third body , respectively .",
    "ew lyrae is an algol - type eclipsing binary discovered by hoffmeister ( 1930 ) and its period changes were recognized in szafranic ( 1956 ) .",
    "spectral type was determined as f0 ( brancewicz & dworak 1980 ) or a89v ( halbedel 1984 ) with the individual masses about 1.39 and 0.84 @xmath14 according to budding ( 2004 ) .",
    "but the values are still not very convincing .",
    "our collection of minimum times ( covering more than 70 years ) leads to new recomputed light elements @xmath15 the potential third body orbits the eclipsing pair with a period of almost 78 years and eccentricity @xmath1 .",
    "its predicted minimal mass would be about 1.1  @xmath14 .",
    "so in the solution of the light curve , the third light would be measurable , but regrettably no light - curve study of this system was made yet .",
    "we could also discuss so - called applegate mechanism which causes the periodic variations in the @xmath4 diagram . at the very",
    "beginning we have to accept some assumptions about the basic parameters of the system : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "but these values are taken only from statistical properties of stars of each spectral type , so they are not very convincing .",
    "we also assume the separation of the components to be @xmath20 and the rate of the differential rotation of the stars @xmath21 , see applegate ( 1992 ) . with these parameters we are able to determine the properties of the applegate effect for both components ( see table 1 ) .",
    "but as we can see from the values , this explanation seems to be completely improbable . especially if we focus on the values @xmath22 and @xmath23 , they are very high and make no sense in our case .",
    "luminosity variations caused by this effect could not exceed the total luminosity of the system and also the value of magnetic field seems to be quite high .",
    "so we can clearly conclude that this effect is not presented in ew lyr .",
    "iv cas is an algol - type eclipsing binary , with spectrum classified as a2 . as in the case of ew lyr",
    ", our knowledge about the system parameters is not very satisfactory . from the data we have calculated new light elements",
    "@xmath24 the @xmath4 diagram in figure 2 covers one hundred years . until the 1990s",
    "there were a possibility to describe the shape of the @xmath4 diagram by a quadratic term , so the mass - transfer hypothesis was discussed . but with new accurately measured minima we are nowadays sure about the periodic behavior .",
    "we have also neglected the visual minima times measured after 1995 .",
    "the potential third body was found in the circular orbit of period almost 60 years and amplitude 0.034 days .",
    "this gives the value of minimal mass about 1.16@xmath14 .",
    "but as in the case of ew lyr , we do not have any analysis of a light curve and also any spectroscopic study of this system , so we can not prove this result .    with the presumptions @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( see budding 2004 ) , the separation of the components @xmath20 and differential rotation of the stars @xmath29 we are able to derive the parameters of the applegate effect ( given in table 1 ) .",
    "but as we can see from the values , this explanation seems to be again improbable on primary component , but we could discuss , if affects the secondary or not .",
    "for example the value @xmath30 seems to be rather high , but if we compare it with the luminosity of the secondary , we almost satisfy the condition @xmath31 introduced by applegate ( 1992 ) , because we get @xmath32 .",
    "so we could discuss the probability of period modulation in iv cas caused by the magnetic activity cycles on secondary component .",
    "this possibility remains to be studied and confirmed to the future .",
    "we have derived new lite parameters for two eclipsing binaries by means of the @xmath4 diagram analysis . we have suggested the light - time effect for explanation of the period variation .",
    "we have also mentioned a probability of presence of magnetic activity cycles , which could modulate the period . in case of secondary component of iv cas",
    "this hypothesis should also be in stage , but we have not enough data to make a final decision .",
    "so the consequence is , that for the confirmation of presence of the lite in these systems , we need further detailed photometric , spectroscopic or astrometric study of these binaries ."
