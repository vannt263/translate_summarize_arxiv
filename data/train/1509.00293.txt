    "<S> we present two deterministic schemes for constructing a cnot gate and a toffoli gate on photon - atom and photon - atom - atom hybrid quantum systems assisted by bad cavities , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> they are achieved by cavity - assisted photon scattering and work in the intermediate coupling region with bad cavities , which relaxes the difficulty of their implementation in experiment . </S>",
    "<S> also , bad cavities are feasible for fast quantum operations and reading out information . compared with previous works </S>",
    "<S> , our schemes do not need any auxiliary qubits and measurements . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the quantum circuits for these gates are simple , especially that for our toffoli gate as only a quarter wave packet is used to interact the photon with each of the atoms every time . </S>",
    "<S> these atom - cavity systems can be used as the quantum nodes in long - distance quantum communication as their relatively long coherence time is suitable for multi - time operations between the photon and the system . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that the average fidelities and efficiencies of our two universal hybrid quantum gates are high with current experimental technology . </S>"
