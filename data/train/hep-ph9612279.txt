    "<S> we demonstrate that a measurement of the bjorken process @xmath0 in the threshold region can yield a precise determination of the higgs boson mass . with an integrated luminosity of @xmath1 , it is possible to measure the higgs mass to within 60(100 ) for @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the triumphs of the lep program was the measurement of the @xmath4-boson mass to two mev . </S>",
    "<S> expectations are also quite good for the measurement of the @xmath5-boson mass ( @xmath6 ) and the top quark mass ( @xmath7 ) in the future , perhaps achieving precision of order 10  mev for @xmath6 and @xmath8 for @xmath7 at the tevatron and the lhc  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> precise values for @xmath6 and @xmath7 can also be obtained at lepton colliders by measuring the @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) threshold cross sections , as illustrated by measurements of @xmath5-pair production at lep center - of - mass energy @xmath13 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements will allow an indirect prediction for the higgs boson mass ( @xmath14 ) and will test the consistency of the standard model ( sm ) at the two - loop level once @xmath14 is known .    </S>",
    "<S> in this letter we point out that , analogously , a very accurate determination of @xmath14 is obtained by measuring the threshold cross section for the bjorken higgs - strahlung process @xcite @xmath15 ; with integrated luminosity @xmath16 , a @xmath17 precision of order 60 mev is possible for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this error in @xmath14 is smaller than that achievable via final state mass reconstruction for a typical detector , and would then be the most accurate determination of @xmath14 at an @xmath18 collider .    </S>",
    "<S> the sm higgs boson is easily discovered in the @xmath19 production mode by running the machine well above threshold ,  at @xmath20 . for @xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> the dominant higgs boson decay is to @xmath22 and most backgrounds can be eliminated by @xmath23-tagging . at the next linear @xmath18 collider ( nlc ) the accuracy for @xmath14 via reconstruction using final state momenta is strongly dependent on the detector performance and signal statistics : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the single - event resolution and @xmath26 is the number of signal events . at an sld - type detector , </S>",
    "<S> the single event resolution for reconstruction of the higgs mass is about @xmath27 for most @xmath19 final states ( including channels with @xmath28 ) @xcite . at the `` super''-lc detector @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the higgs mass measurement would be best performed by examining the mass spectrum of the system recoiling against @xmath28 decays . </S>",
    "<S> the resolution in this spectrum would be about @xmath29 @xcite . for the sm higgs boson , </S>",
    "<S> the accuracies of the @xmath14 determination for the two types of detector are via its @xmath30 decay mode . </S>",
    "<S> the mass resolution is expected to be @xmath31 . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 which take into account the effective branching ratios appropriate in the two different cases . the super - lc accuracy would be competitive with that we shall obtain via the threshold technique . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the not unlikely case that the detector is of the sld - type , the best means for measuring @xmath14 will be to first determine @xmath14 to within a few hundred mev in @xmath20 running [ which will also yield a precise measurement of @xmath33 and then reconfigure the collider for maximal luminosity just above the threshold energy @xmath34 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ zhcurve ] we show the cross section for the bjorken process @xmath15 for higgs masses from 50 to 150  gev . since the threshold behavior is @xmath35-wave , the rise in the cross section in the threshold region is rapid , as can be seen for the case of @xmath36  gev in the inset figure , the cross section being a few tenths of a pb . at lep ii , the few hundred pb@xmath37 of luminosity that might be devoted to such </S>",
    "<S> a threshold would yield just a handful of events </S>",
    "<S> . however , much higher luminosity is possible at threshold at the nlc @xcite or a muon collider @xcite .    in the ideal case that the normalization of the measured @xmath19 cross section as a function of @xmath38 can be precisely predicted , including efficiencies and systematic effects , sensitivity to the sm higgs boson mass is maximized by a single measurement of the cross section at @xmath39  gev , just above the real particle threshold . with a @xmath40 measurement of @xmath14 from initial </S>",
    "<S> running [ see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sldjlcerrors ] ) ] @xmath38 can be set quite close to this optimal point . </S>",
    "<S> as an example of the precision that might be achieved , suppose @xmath36  gev and backgrounds are neglected . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath19 cross section is 120  fb and is rising at a rate of 0.05  fb / mev . with @xmath41 and including an overall ( @xmath23-tagging , geometric and event identification ) efficiency of @xmath42 , this yields @xmath43 events , or a measurement of the cross section to about 2% . from the slope of the cross section one </S>",
    "<S> concludes that a @xmath14 measurement with accuracy of roughly 50  mev is possible .    in practice </S>",
    "<S> , there will be systematic errors associated with experimental efficiencies as well as for theoretical predictions of the @xmath19 cross section and @xmath44 branching ratio(s ) that will be very difficult to reduce below the 1% level . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the cross section measured at @xmath38 well - above threshold in the initial @xmath45 discovery to that measured right at threshold is thus the key to determining @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical uncertainties will cancel in the ratio . </S>",
    "<S> given the high luminosity that should be available for measurements both well - above threshold and right at threshold , changes in @xmath23-tagging , geometrical efficiencies , and jet misidentification as a function of @xmath38 may be understood at the @xmath46 level , provided the final - focus reconfiguration required to optimize luminosity at the lower threshold @xmath38 does not impel detector changes that would lead to significant changes in the experimental systematic effects .    </S>",
    "<S> for a more precise estimate of the accuracy with which @xmath14 can be measured , we employ @xmath23-tagging and cuts in order to reduce the background to a very low level . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we require : 1 ) tagging of both @xmath23 s in the event ( for which an overall 50% efficiency will be assumed ) ; 2 ) @xmath47 ; 3 ) @xmath48 (  broadly consistent means that constructive interference of @xmath19 diagrams with @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) fusion diagrams in the @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) channels @xcite will be small . ] with @xmath53 ) , where @xmath54^{1/2}$ ] with @xmath55 ; 4 ) @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the polar angle with respect to the beam direction . with these cuts </S>",
    "<S> the only significant background will be that from @xmath50 production , where at least one of the @xmath4 s decays to @xmath22 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eezbb ] , we compare the cross section versus @xmath38 for the @xmath58 background to that for the @xmath15 ( with @xmath59 ) signal , where the signal is computed for @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the background is very much smaller than the signal unless @xmath14 is close to @xmath53 .    the expected precision for the higgs mass is given in fig .  [ error ] for an integrated luminosity of 50  fb@xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the precision degrades as @xmath14 increases because the signal cross section is smaller ( see fig .  [ zhcurve ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the background from the @xmath4-peak reduces the precision for @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> bremsstrahlung , beamstrahlung and beam energy smearing yield a reduction in sensitivity of 15% at a muon collider and 35% at an @xmath62 collider .    </S>",
    "<S> if the higgs boson is discovered at the tevatron or lhc prior to construction of the nlc , the nlc could be configured from the beginning for optimal luminosity in the vicinity of the @xmath19 threshold . </S>",
    "<S> discovery , then the appropriate first emphasis might be @xmath63-channel @xmath44 production , which allows extremely accurate mass , width and coupling - constant - ratio determinations @xcite . ] </S>",
    "<S> a motivation for doing so is that , at the nlc , measurements near the peak in the @xmath19 cross section ( not far above threshold ) would yield the highest rates and , hence , smallest errors possible for determining the branching ratios , couplings and total width of the @xmath44 . in order to determine both these @xmath44 properties and also @xmath14 , </S>",
    "<S> a very useful first set of measurements would be to take data at @xmath64 and at @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the @xmath66 rates at these two energies would simultaneously determine @xmath14 and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 , the square of @xmath69 coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusive ( recoil spectrum ) @xmath19 event rate would yield a determination of @xmath70 directly and @xmath71 could then be computed ; deviations in either from sm expectations would be of great interest . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ zhsin2 ] shows the statistical precision that can be obtained in a two parameter fit to @xmath14 and @xmath72 ( before including smearing effects from bremsstrahlung , beamstrahlung and beam energy spread ) using a combined integrated luminosity of 50  fb@xmath37 for the above two values of @xmath38 in the threshold region . </S>",
    "<S> the smallest error in @xmath14 is @xmath73 ( for @xmath2 ) obtained with @xmath74 at @xmath75 and @xmath76 at @xmath77  gev . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath14 is determined by the ratio of the cross sections at the two energies , systematic uncertainties would cancel almost completely for such closely spaced energies , and the error in @xmath14 would be almost entirely statistical . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of @xmath67 would be at the @xmath78 statistical level ( which is better than the precision that can be reached with @xmath79 accumulated at @xmath20 @xcite ) ; at this level of statistical error , the systematic uncertainties on @xmath80 from @xmath23-tagging , geometrical cuts and event - identification efficiencies will probably dominate . </S>",
    "<S> doubling @xmath81 to @xmath1 ( so that @xmath82 ) would yield @xmath83 error for @xmath14 , comparable to the error of @xmath84 shown in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  [ error ] for @xmath85 assuming small statistical error for @xmath67 at @xmath20 .    </S>",
    "<S> two comments are particularly relevant . </S>",
    "<S> first , a @xmath86 uncertainty on @xmath14 would allow almost immediate centering on the @xmath63-channel higgs resonance peak at a muon collider ( thereby avoiding expending luminosity on a scan location of the peak ) . for @xmath21 , a fine scan over the higgs peak at the muon collider </S>",
    "<S> would then yield an extraordinarily precise determination of @xmath14 along with a determination of the total @xmath44 width that is far more accurate @xcite than achievable by other means @xcite in this mass region . </S>",
    "<S> second , a @xmath86 level of accuracy for @xmath14 should prove to be of great value for constraining parameters entering into radiative corrections to the higgs mass . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model , </S>",
    "<S> the leading one - loop correction to the tree - level prediction for the mass of the light sm - like @xmath87 is @xcite : @xmath88 $ ] , where @xmath89 is the top - squark mass and we have simplified by neglecting top - squark mixing and non - degeneracy . from this formula one finds @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , for @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a @xmath86 measurement of @xmath95 would translate into very tight constraints on @xmath7 and @xmath89 of about @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> important squark mixing parameters would be similarly constrained . </S>",
    "<S> the challenge will be to compute higher loop corrections to @xmath95 to the @xmath86 level .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that with sufficient luminosity it is possible to determine the higgs boson mass to a high and very valuable level of precision by measuring the @xmath98 cross section just above threshold and normalizing to a second measurement either well above threshold or near the @xmath19 cross section peak . </S>",
    "<S> one simultaneously determines @xmath67 at a level of accuracy that could distinguish between the standard model higgs sector and its many possible (  supersymmetric ) extensions . </S>"
