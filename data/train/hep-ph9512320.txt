    "bodwin , braaten , and lepage ( bbl ) have devised a rigorous factorization formalism that places the calculation of inclusive quarkonium annihilation and production on a solid theoretical foundation  @xcite .",
    "their approach is based on nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd )  @xcite .",
    "this is an effective field theory involving an expansion in derivatives , constructed so as to be equivalent to qcd for non - relativistic heavy quark - anti - quark scattering , to any desired order in the relative three - momentum of the heavy quarks . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the production rate for a quarkonium bound state @xmath6 can be written using a factorization formula , which is a sum of products , having the form @xmath7 the  short - distance \" coefficients @xmath8 are obtainable in perturbation theory as a series in @xmath9 , and can be determined through a calculation of the production rate of an on - shell @xmath10 pair . as to the nrqcd matrix elements @xmath11 , they encode analytically uncalculable  long - distance \" effects such as the hadronization of a @xmath10 pair into bound quarkonium .",
    "the index @xmath12 labels color and angular - momentum quantum numbers , as well as the order in the nrqcd momentum expansion .",
    "in contrast to previous approaches , the bbl formalism establishes a framework within which it is possible to properly handle soft gluon effects and systematically incorporate relativistic corrections .",
    "the size of any nrqcd matrix element can be estimated as some power of the small parameter @xmath13 , the typical velocity of the heavy quarks in the bound state .",
    "( for charmonium , @xmath14 . ) combining @xmath13-scaling estimates with knowledge of the size of the @xmath8 ( for which the order in @xmath9 is easily determined ) , one can deduce the relative importance of the various terms in the factorization formula . keeping only those terms warranted by experimental precision",
    ", one can cast each observable as a sum involving only a small number of nrqcd matrix elements . in this way ,",
    "the important nrqcd matrix elements can be empirically determined by fitting a set of factorization formul  to a body of experimental data .    in this paper",
    "we carefully present an example of a calculation in the factorization formalism .",
    "the quantity that we choose to calculate is the inclusive hadronic @xmath0 production cross section , since it is needed for a complete theoretical description of @xmath0 production at fixed target experiments . using @xmath13-scaling rules alluded to above",
    ", we find that in addition to previously calculated color - singlet contributions , there exist equally important contributions involving the production of @xmath1 pairs in a color - octet state .",
    "the color - octet processes which turn out to be important in hadronic @xmath0 production are those in which the heavy quark pair is produced in either a @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 angular - momentum state .    taking the octet - mechanism contributions to hadronic @xmath0 production as an illustrative example , we present a systematic procedure for determining the short - distance coefficients @xmath8 appearing in the factorization formula .",
    "this procedure involves the calculation of rates for the production of @xmath10 pairs with specific color and angular - momentum quantum numbers .",
    "these production rates are expressed as an integral over @xmath15 , the relative three - momentum of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the @xmath10 rest frame , with the integrand being a taylor expansion in @xmath18 .",
    "the production rates are calculated both in full qcd and in nrqcd , and then the results are `` matched , '' allowing a determination of the @xmath8 .",
    "the feynman diagrams for the leading color - singlet hadronic @xmath0 production subprocesses are shown in figure 1 . however",
    ", we do not calculate these leading color - singlet contributions since they have already been treated using the color - singlet - wavefunction model  @xcite . for calculations at leading order in @xmath19",
    ", the results of this latter approach can be readily transformed into the factorization formalism language .",
    "as was stated in the introduction , the nrqcd factorization formalism prescribes a means of expressing the inclusive production rate of a heavy quarkonium meson @xmath6 using a factorization formula , which is a sum of products of the form @xmath20 the short - distance coefficients @xmath8 can be calculated using feynman diagram methods . each @xmath8 can be expressed as a perturbation series in @xmath9 .",
    "the appropriate scale for the process is @xmath21 since this is the scale that is associated with the production of a @xmath10 pair with small relative momentum .",
    "the nrqcd matrix elements @xmath22 are of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are bilinear heavy - quark field operators ; @xmath24 may take forms such as @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , _ etc . _",
    "and @xmath25 takes forms such as @xmath29 , _ etc . _ the symbol @xmath30 appearing in the factorization formula is the combined mass dimensions of the operators @xmath24 and @xmath31 .",
    "the heavy - quark field operators @xmath0 and @xmath32 are color - triplet columns , and are defined to annihilate a heavy quark and anti - quark , respectively .",
    "thus , the @xmath24 annihilate @xmath10 pairs while the @xmath25 create them .",
    "the insertion of a color matrix @xmath33 in the bilinear operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath34 , means that the bilinears project a color - octet rather than a color - singlet @xmath10 state .",
    "the index @xmath12 labels the various properties of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "these properties include : 1 ) the color - state of the @xmath10 pair projected by the operator ( singlet or octet , designated by @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) ; 2 ) the angular - momentum state of the @xmath10 pair projected by the operator ( given using the spectroscopic notation @xmath37 ) ; and 3 ) the order of the operator in the momentum expansion in the nrqcd effective lagrangian .",
    "the order in the momentum expansion can be increased simply by inserting into @xmath24 or @xmath25 the scalar @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is an @xmath40 covariant derivative . in eq .",
    "( [ form : of : matrix : element ] ) , the sum over @xmath41 is a symbolic reminder that we are calculating inclusive quarkonium production . in the discussion that follows , the sums over @xmath41 and @xmath42 will always be assumed .",
    "the factorization formula eq .",
    "( [ b : eq : facsigb ] ) contains an arbitarary factorization scale @xmath43 . in the matrix elements",
    "the scale @xmath43 can be identified with the ultraviolet cutoff of the nrqcd effective theory . since",
    "physical results are independent of @xmath43 , dependence on @xmath43 in the short - distance coefficients cancels against that in the nrqcd matrix elements .    in the calculation of the factorization formula for a given quarkonium production rate , it is first necessary to determine which are the most important terms in the series .",
    "this operation entails a consideration of two issues : the order in @xmath9 of the @xmath8 and the order in @xmath19 of the @xmath44 , _ i.e. _ their  @xmath13-scaling . \" in the next subsection , we will turn to the issue of @xmath13-scaling of the nrqcd matrix elements .",
    "the most practical approach to the issue of @xmath13-scaling of nrqcd matrix elements is to define a @xmath13-scaling  baseline , \" with all other matrix elements being suppressed by some relative power of @xmath13 .",
    "this baseline corresponds to those matrix elements in which the bilinear operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 project out the predominant @xmath10 component of the quarkonium , and in which this predominant component is in an s - wave . for charmonium ,",
    "examples of such baseline matrix elements are @xmath45 if one inserts the scalar operator @xmath38 in either of the bilinear operators , the resulting matrix elements are suppressed by @xmath19 compared to those in eqs .",
    "( [ baseline : examples ] ) .",
    "next let us consider those matrix elements in which the bilinear operators project out the predominant @xmath10 component of the quarkonium , and in which this predominant component is in a p - wave .",
    "examples are    @xmath46 } \\right )   \\psi    \\langle \\chi_{2 m_j } + x | \\psi^\\dagger\\left ( -\\frac{i}{2}\\stackrel{\\leftrightarrow}{d}^{[i}\\sigma^{j ] } \\right ) \\chi     to a rough approximation , the above matrix elements , when divided by @xmath47 , are suppressed with respect to the baseline by @xmath19 , and of course , the insertion of @xmath38 would result in further suppression by @xmath19 .",
    "the preceding discussion has merely involved counting powers of momentum .",
    "there is , however , an important additional issue in the @xmath13-scaling of nrqcd matrix elements .",
    "this second issue hinges on the fock state expansion of the quarkonium meson .",
    "the fock state expansion of , for example , the @xmath0 particle , in coulomb gauge , can be thought of schematically as @xmath48 where @xmath49 represents a dynamical gluon , _",
    "i.e. _ one whose effects can not be incorporated into an instantaneous potential and whose typical momentum is @xmath50 .",
    "the angular - momentum quantum numbers of the @xmath1 pairs in the various fock states are indicated in spectroscopic notation , and their color configurations are labeled by @xmath35 for singlet or @xmath36 for octet .",
    "we will now discuss the @xmath13-scaling of the various coefficients @xmath51 , @xmath52 , _ etc .",
    "_    since the state @xmath53 is the predominant fock state in @xmath54 , we expect that the coefficient @xmath55 is just a little less than unity , _ i.e. _ @xmath56 . as to the fock state @xmath57 , this configuration arises when the predominant state radiates a soft dynamical gluon ; such a process is mediated principally by the electric dipole operator , for which the selection rule is @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and which involves a single power of heavy quark three - momentum ; thus , the coefficient @xmath60 is of order @xmath61 .",
    "the electric dipole emission of yet another gluon involves a change from the @xmath62-wave state @xmath63 to the @xmath64- and @xmath65-wave states @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 ; their coefficients  @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73  are of order @xmath19 .",
    "lastly , we consider the coefficient of the state @xmath74 .",
    "fluctuations into this spin - singlet state from the predominant spin - triplet state are associated with the emission of a soft gluon via a spin - flipping magnetic dipole transition ; such transitions involve the gluon three - momentum @xmath75 rather than the heavy quark three - momentum @xmath76 , and therefore the coefficient @xmath77 is of order @xmath19 .",
    "we now bring together the power - counting rules and the fock state ideas presented above .",
    "let us consider as an example the matrix element @xmath78 the bilinear operators project out the @xmath79 fock state , whose coefficient in the expansion is of order @xmath19 .",
    "thus , @xmath80 is suppressed by roughly @xmath81 compared to the @xmath64-wave baseline .    as another example , consider the @xmath13-scaling of the matrix element @xmath82 .",
    "the bilinear operators contained therein project out the state @xmath57 , whose coefficient in the expansion would be of order @xmath61 .",
    "this fock state suppression , combined with the derivatives inherent in the @xmath62-wave operators , gives a @xmath13-scaling of @xmath81 ( with respect to the baseline ) for @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath13-scaling of those nrqcd matrix elements pertinent to the calculation of hadronic @xmath0 production are given in table i.      the leading - order feynman diagrams for the production of a @xmath1 pair in color - octet states are presented in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "the diagram in figure 2 ( @xmath84 ) produces a @xmath85 state .",
    "the diagrams in figure 3a ( the gluon fusion process @xmath86 ) produce @xmath87 , @xmath85 and @xmath88 states . the diagram in figure 3b ( @xmath89 ) produces a @xmath85 state .",
    "it is interesting to note that , at leading order in the @xmath18 expansion , the amplitude for the production of @xmath85 from figures 3a cancels against the amplitude for the same quantum number production in figure 3b , so that the total production of @xmath85 from gluon - gluon collisions vanishes .    to determine the rough size of a term in the factorization formula , one attributes to it a power of @xmath90 for each vertex in the feynman diagram , and the appropriate power of @xmath91 according to its @xmath13-scaling",
    "we summarize the @xmath92 powers associated with the leading order subprocesses in table ii .",
    "once the most important terms in the factorization formula have been identified , one procedes to compute the short - distance coefficients @xmath8 .",
    "this is done by matching perturbative full qcd and perturbative nrqcd calculations for the production rate of @xmath1 pairs with specific color and angular - momentum quantum numbers .",
    "these rates are expressed as an integral over relative momentum @xmath15 , with the integrand given as a taylor expansion in @xmath18    in the next sections , we calculate the production rates for the various important octet subprocesses contributing to hadronic @xmath0 production , and outline in detail the matching procedure .",
    "we now calculate the leading - order contribution to the cross section for inclusive @xmath0 production from the color - octet subprocess @xmath93 .",
    "this is done in three steps .",
    "first we carry out a perturbative qcd calculation of the production rate for the process @xmath94 with on - shell heavy quarks .",
    "the second step consists of calculating the production rate for the same process in nrqcd .",
    "the final step will be to determine the short - distance coefficient @xmath8 by matching the qcd and nrqcd calculations .      in noncovariant conventions ,",
    "the transition amplitude for the process @xmath95 , illustrated in figure  2 , is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are color indices and @xmath101 and @xmath102 are heavy - quark spin indices .",

    "the bilinear combination @xmath121 corresponds to a @xmath2 spin configuration of the @xmath106 pair .",
    "working to leading order in @xmath15 , we keep only the @xmath2 term : @xmath122 anticipating that the probability of hadronization is negligible for @xmath123 , we need only derive the algebraic form of @xmath124 for small @xmath15 , and therefore need only keep the first few terms in the taylor expansion in @xmath18 : @xmath125 where the constant @xmath126  which we do not bother to calculate explicitly  is the coefficient of the second term in the taylor series expansion in @xmath18 .",
    "it must be kept in mind that the factor appearing in brackets is not , at this point in the calculation , a rapidly converging series .",
    "indeed , the upper bound on @xmath15 is associated with the total momentum available in the experiment , and in general this can be much greater than @xmath127 . however , for the purposes of matching in the factorization formalism , we treat @xmath124 as an expansion in @xmath18 , and consider only the first few terms , the probability of hadronization being non - negligible only for small @xmath15 .",

    "this check entails first noting the surprising fact that the amplitudes for @xmath214 are proportional to those for @xmath215 .",

    "the formul  summarized above are of great relevance in the parametrization of quarkonium production , and will be useful in future analyses . in particular , these expression , along with the previously calculated color - singlet result , appear in a leading order calculation of hadronic @xmath0 production at fixed target experiments .",
