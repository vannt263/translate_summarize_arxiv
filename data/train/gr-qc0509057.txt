    "analogue gravity has gained a lot of popularity in the last few years @xcite ( for a recent review and a comprehensive list of references , see @xcite ) for two obvious reasons : first , it provides a laboratory for testing some exotic effects of general relativity , such as black holes , wormholes , warped space - time , etc .",
    "second , since the scale of analogue gravity is not fixed by the planck length , there is hope that quantum gravity effects , which normally are important beyond the planck scale only , may be seen on larger length scales .",
    "a particular example of analogue gravity is acoustic geometry in which an inhomogeneous fluid flow provides a curved space - time background for the propagation of sound waves .",
    "the most appealing aspect of acoustic geometry is a relatively easy way to construct an acoustic horizon which is an analogue of the black hole horizon in general relativity . in this way",
    "a number of interesting features which normally are extremely difficult to observe in astrophysical black holes , can be studied using an acoustic analogue of the black hole built in the laboratory .    in all papers dealing with acoustic geometry the flows with desired properties",
    "are artificially constructed .",
    "so far , these constructions have been only hypothetical since the necessary conditions for the actual observation of the horizon and the measurements of the corresponding analogue hawking temperature are still difficult to realize in the laboratory .",
    "transonic accretion onto astrophysical black holes is a unique example of analogue gravity realized in nature @xcite .",
    "spherical accretion was first studied in terms of relativistic acoustic metric by moncrief @xcite .",
    "recently , several aspects of analogue horizon radiation have been investigated for a spherically symmetric general relativistic @xcite and post - newtonian @xcite accretion flow . in this paper",
    "we study acoustic geometry of an axially symmetric accretion disk round a rotating astrophysical black hole or round a neutron star .",
    "the flow considered in this paper is a relativistic generalization of the acoustic black hole analogues . to study acoustic geometry in most simple terms ,",
    "we assume isentropic accretion of the fluid described by a polytropic equation of state .",
    "compared with a spherically symmetric flow , an axially symmetric flow exhibits a more complex structure , which differs from the spherically symmetric flow in two aspects .",
    "first , in axially symmetric accretion the acoustic horizon and the stationary limit surface generally do not coincide and second , multitransonic configurations with more than one acoustic horizons are possible .",
    "in section [ preliminaries ] we outline the basic relativistic hydrodynamics necessary for the study of accretion in terms of acoustic geometry . in section [ accretion ]",
    "we describe the relativistic equations governing the accretion flow . in section [ acoustic ]",
    "we discuss the formation of a standing shock and acoustic horizons at sonic points and in section [ causal ] we study the acoustic causal structure of multitransonic accretion and wind .",
    "section [ surface ] is devoted to a calculation of the analogue surface gravity and in section [ superradiance ] we briefly discuss the acoustic superradiance . finally , we conclude the paper with section [ conclude ] .",
    "for the sake of completeness and consistency of the paper , as a starting point we review some well - known basic results in relativistic hydrodynamics and acoustics .",
    "we restrict attention to a stationary gravitating isentropic fluid in a stationary background metric @xmath0 .",
    "we work in units @xmath1 and use the convention of positive - time - negative - space metric signature .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the 4-velocity field , i.e. , the unit vector field tangent to the flow streamlines .",
    "in general , a 4-velocity can be expressed in terms of the 3-velocity components @xcite @xmath3 @xmath4 with the induced three - dimensional spatial metric @xmath5 and the lorentz factor @xmath6    let @xmath7 denote a set of hypersurfaces defined by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a constant , @xmath10 .",
    "each @xmath11 is timelike since its normal @xmath12 is spacelike and may be normalized as @xmath13 .",
    "the 4-velocity at each point may be decomposed into normal and tangential components with respect to @xmath11 : @xmath14 where @xmath15    next , we consider a two - dimensional axisymmetric flow in a stationary axisymmetric space - time .",
    "physically , this may be a model for a black hole accretion disk , or for a draining flow in an axially symmetric bathtub . using the notation @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ,",
    "the 4-velocity is given by @xmath19 @xmath20 then , the 3-velocity squared may be written as @xmath21 with @xmath22 for a hypersurface of constant @xmath23 defined by ( [ eq135 ] ) the decomposition ( [ eq037 ] ) yields @xmath24 it is useful to define a _ corotating frame _ as a coordinate frame of reference in which @xmath25 ( or @xmath26 ) vanishes and , as a consequence @xmath27 .",
    "this frame is equivalent to the frame comoving with @xmath28 . in other words , in the corotating frame the vector @xmath28 takes a simple form @xmath29 the transition to a corotating frame is achieved by a simple coordinate transformation @xmath30 where the angular velocity @xmath31 is defined as @xmath32    more generally , we may define a _ coorbiting frame _ as a coordinate frame of reference comoving with @xmath28 .",
    "hence an axially symmetric coorbiting frame is corotating .",
    "the acoustic metric tensor and its inverse are defined by @xcite @xmath33 , \\label{eq022 } \\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; g^{\\mu\\nu } = \\frac{wc_s}{n } \\left[g^{\\mu\\nu}-(1-\\frac{1}{c_s^2})u^{\\mu}u^{\\mu } \\right]\\ , , \\label{eq029}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the particle number , @xmath35 the specific enthalpy of the fluid and @xmath36 the speed of sound . in analogy to the event horizon in general relativity ,",
    "the _ acoustic horizon _ may be defined as a time - like hypersurface whose normal @xmath37 is null with respect to the acoustic metric , i.e. , @xmath38 equivalently , we may define the acoustic horizon as a hypersurface defined by the equation @xcite @xmath39 the metric defined by ( [ eq029 ] ) is very general and with no further assumptions the determination of acoustic horizons may be nontrivial",
    ". however , the matter may greatly simplify if we assume a certain symmetry , such that the analogy with the familiar stationary axisymmetric black hole may be drawn .",
    "we consider the acoustic geometry that satisfies the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "the acoustic metric is stationary .",
    "2 .   the flow is symmetric under the transformation that generates a displacement on the hypersurface @xmath11 of constant @xmath23 along the projection of the flow velocity .",
    "3 .   the metric @xmath0 is invariant under the above transformation .",
    "the last two statements are equivalent to saying that a displacement along the projection of the flow velocity on @xmath11 is an isometry .",
    "the axisymmetric flow considered in section [ geometry ] is an example that fulfils the above requirements .",
    "it may be easily shown that , for an axially symmetric flow , the metric discriminant @xmath40 vanishes at the acoustic horizon .",
    "in analogy to the kerr black hole we may also define the _",
    "acoustic ergo region _ as a region in space - time where the stationary killing vector @xmath41 becomes space - like .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath42 , defined with respect to the acoustic metric , is given by @xmath43 this becomes negative when the magnitude of the flow velocity @xmath23 exceeds the speed of sound @xmath36 .",
    "the boundary of the ergo - region defined by the equation @xmath44 is a hypersurface called _ stationary limit surface _ @xcite .",
    "equivalently , the stationary limit surface may be defined as a hypersurface at which @xmath45    in the following sections we often use the terms _ subsonic _ , _ supersonic _ and _ transonic_. these notions in relativistic hydrodynamics make sense only with respect to a specified frame of reference .",
    "for example , a flow which is supersonic with respect to an observer at rest is subsonic with respect to a comoving observer . in an axially symmetric flow",
    "it is convenient to use the corotating frame of reference , i.e. , the frame in which @xmath46 vanishes , to define a locally subsonic or supersonic flow in the following way : the flow at a radial distance @xmath47 is said to be subsonic or supersonic if @xmath48 or @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "it may be shown that the above definition is consistent with another definition valid in any other reference frame that preserves temporal and axial isometry : the axisymmetric flow is said to be locally subsonic or supersonic if @xmath50 or @xmath51 , respectively . alternatively , as we demonstrate in section [ causal ] , we may use equation ( [ eq209 ] ) to define a flow with @xmath52 as subsonic and with @xmath53 as supersonic .",
    "finally , a flow is said to be _ transonic _ if a transition from a subsonic to a supersonic flow region , or vice versa , takes place .",
    "the point of transition is called the _ sonic point _ if the transition is continuous . a discontinuous supersonic to subsonic transition is called _ shock_.      propagation of acoustic waves in an inhomogeneous fluid moving in curved space - time is governed by the massless wave equation @xmath54 where @xmath55 it may be shown that equation ( [ eq028 ] ) follows from the free wave equation that describes the propagation of acoustic perturbations in a homogeneous fluid in flat space - time @xmath56 with @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "equation ( [ eq028 ] ) is obtained by replacing @xmath60 by @xmath61 and @xmath62 by the covariant derivative @xmath63 associated with the metric @xmath64 . in this way",
    "we introduce the",
    " acoustic equivalence principle \" in full analogy with general relativity .",
    "we also define the stress tensor of the field @xmath65 @xmath66 which satisfies @xmath67 .    by standard arguments",
    "@xcite it follows that the lines of acoustic propagation are null geodesics with respect to the acoustic metric . in other words ,",
    "the wave vector @xmath68 , which is timelike and may be normalized to unity , is null with respect to the acoustic metric , i.e. , @xmath69 and satisfies the acoustic geodesic equation @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 however , as we have said , @xmath68 is timelike with respect to the space - time metric , so acoustic perturbations propagate along timelike curves .",
    "next we show that the perturbations that propagate parallel to the streamlines cross the horizon and those that propagate in the opposite direction are trapped .",
    "we assume that the space - time metric is stationary and the flow is steady . at any fixed time",
    "@xmath73 the flow congruence crosses the two - dimensional surfaces \\{@xmath74=const , @xmath75}. in particular , the acoustic horizon defined by @xmath76 at fixed",
    "@xmath75 is one of these surfaces .",
    "the hypersurface @xmath76 is of course timelike since its normal @xmath77 is a spacelike vector . let @xmath68 be a timelike unit vector tangent to the lines of acoustic propagation",
    ". then @xmath68 may be decomposed in a similar way as @xmath78 in equation ( [ eq037 ] ) , @xmath79 where @xmath80 now we restrict attention to the perturbations for which @xmath81 . in the coorbiting frame",
    "defined in section [ geometry ] , these perturbations propagate either parallel or antiparallel to the streamlines , i.e. , the spatial part of @xmath82 is parallel or antiparallel to the 3-velocity of the fluid . as a consequence of ( [ eq030 ] ) we have @xmath83 .",
    "this equation states the fact that acoustic perturbations propagate with the velocity of sound @xmath36 with respect to the fluid . at the horizon , as may be easily shown , @xmath84 for the perturbations going parallel , and @xmath85 for those going antiparallel to the streamlines . since in the first case we have @xmath86 , the acoustic perturbations that propagate parallel to the streamlines will cross the horizon .",
    "the perturbations going antiparallel will satisfy @xmath87 at the horizon and hence will be trapped .",
    "the purpose of this section is to demonstrate how the quantization of phonons in the presence of the acoustic horizon yields acoustic hawking radiation .",
    "the acoustic perturbations considered here are classical sound waves or _",
    "phonons _ that satisfy the massles wave equation ( [ eq028 ] ) in curved background with the metric @xmath64 given by ( [ eq029 ] ) .",
    "irrespective of the underlying microscopic structure acoustic perturbations are quantized",
    ". a precise quantization scheme for an analogue gravity system may be rather involved @xcite .",
    "however , at the scales larger than the atomic scales below which a perfect fluid description breaks down , the atomic substructure may be neglected and the field may be considered elementary . hence , the quantization proceeds in the same way as in the case of a scalar field in curved space @xcite with a suitable uv cutoff for the scales below a typical atomic size of a few  .    for our purpose ,",
    "the most convenient quantization prescription is the euclidean path integral formulation .",
    "consider a 2 + 1-dimensional disc geometry .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ eq028 ] ) follows from the variational principle applied to the action functional @xmath88=\\int dtdrd\\phi\\ ,   \\sqrt{-g}\\ , g^{\\mu\\nu } \\partial_{\\mu}\\varphi \\partial_{\\nu}\\varphi\\ , .",

    "the integral over @xmath92 extends up to infinity . here ,",
    "owing to the presence of the acoustic horizon , the integral over @xmath92 will be cut at the inverse hawking temperature @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes the analogue surface gravity . to illustrate how this happens , consider , for simplicity , a nonrotating fluid ( @xmath95 ) in an arbitrary static , spherically symmetric space - time .",
    "it may be easily shown that the acoustic metric takes the form @xmath96 where the background metric coefficients @xmath97 are functions of @xmath47 only , and we have omited the irrelevant conformal factor @xmath98 . using the coordinate transformation @xmath99 we remove the off - diagonal part from ( [ eq232 ] ) and obtain @xmath100 g_{rr}\\ ,",

    "furthermore , making the substitutions @xmath112 and @xmath113 , the euclidean action takes the form of the 2 + 1-dimensional free scalar field action at nonzero temperature @xmath114=\\int_0^{2\\pi/\\kappa } d\\tau   \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dx \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } dy \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\partial_{\\mu } \\varphi)^2 ,   \\label{eq240}\\ ] ] where we have set the upper and lower bounds of the integral over @xmath115 to @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively , assuming that @xmath118 is sufficiently large .",
    "hence , the functional integral @xmath119 in ( [ eq229 ] ) is evaluated over the fields @xmath120 that are periodic in @xmath92 with period @xmath93 . in this way ,",
    "the functional @xmath119 is just the partition function for a grandcanonical ensemble of free massless bosons at the hawking temperature @xmath121 .",
    "however , the radiation spectrum will not be exactly thermal since we have to cut off the scales below the atomic scale @xcite .",
    "the choice of the cutoff and the deviation of the acoustic radiation spectrum from the thermal spectrum is closely related to the so - called _ transplanckian problem _ of hawking radiation @xcite .",

    "the acoustic metric and the background space - time metric generally do not share the isometries .",
    "for example , the axial symmetry of a tilted accretion disc round a rotating black hole obviously does not coincide with that of the black hole .    here",
    "we assume that the flow and the space time metric @xmath0 share a specific symmetry generated by a killing vector @xmath138 .",
    "let @xmath138 be a killing vector field and let the flow be isentropic and invariant under the group of transformations generated by @xmath138 .",
    "then the quantity @xmath139 is constant along the stream line .",
    "* proof * : multiplying the euler equation ( [ eq103 ] ) by @xmath140 we obtain @xmath141 the second term in ( [ eq006 ] ) vanishes by killing s equation and the last term vanishes by symmetry .",

    "@xmath143    * *",
    "remark * since , by assumption , the flow shares the symmetry of @xmath0 , the killing vector @xmath140 is also killing with respect to the acoustic metric .",

    "it follows @xmath149    for an adiabatic process , the entropy density is proportional to the particle number density , i.e. , @xmath150 . without further assumptions ,",
    "the entropy density per particle @xmath151 is an undetermined constant . if , in addition to ( [ eq216 ] ) , the clapeyron equation for an ideal gas holds @xmath152 and assuming that @xmath153 is temperature independent , then the entropy per particle is given by @xcite @xmath154 where @xmath155 is a constant that depends only on the chemical composition of the gas .",

    "for a flow of matter with a non - zero angular momentum density , spherical symmetry is broken and accretion phenomena are studied employing an axisymmetric configuration .",
    "accreting matter is thrown into circular orbits , leading to the formation of _ accretion disks _ around astrophysical black holes or neutron stars . the pioneering contribution to study the properties of general relativistic accretion disks",
    "is attributed to two classic papers by bardeen , press and teukolsky @xcite and novikov and thorne @xcite .",
    "if the accreting material is assumed to be at rest far from the accreting black hole , the flow must exhibit transonic behaviour since the velocity of fluid particles necessarily approaches the speed of light as they approach the black - hole event horizon . for certain values of the intrinsic angular momentum density of the accreting material ,",
    "the number of sonic points , unlike in spherical accretion , may exceed one , and accretion is called _ multi - transonic_. study of such multi - transonic flows was initiated by abramowicz and zurek @xcite .",
    "subsequently , multi - transonic phenomena in black hole accretion disks and formation of shock waves as a consequence of these phenomena , have been studied by a number of authors ( for further details and for references see , e.g. , @xcite ) .      in this section ,",
    "we outline the formalism for calculating the location of sonic points as a function of the specific flow energy @xmath161 , the specific angular momentum @xmath162 and the polytropic index @xmath163 @xcite applied to axisymmetric accretion .",
    "we assume that the accretion flow is described by a disk placed in the equatorial plane of a rotating astrophysical object , e.g. , a kerr black hole or a neutron star , of mass @xmath164 . specifying the metric to be stationary and axially symmetric , the two generators @xmath42 and @xmath165 of the temporal and axial isometry , respectively , satisfy equation ( [ eq007 ] ) and hence the quantities @xmath166 and @xmath167 are constant along the streamlines .",
    "given the equation of state of the fluid , the constants of motion @xmath168 and @xmath169 fully determine the accretion flow .",
    "it is convenient to introduce another constant @xmath170 which is called _ specific angular momentum_. it may be easily shown that the angular velocity @xmath31 defined by ( [ eq001 ] ) is expressed in terms of @xmath162 as @xmath171 with the help of this equation , either from the normalization condition @xmath172 or directly from ( [ eq001 ] ) with ( [ eq010])-([eq011 ] ) , we find @xmath173 where , using the notation of @xcite , @xmath174 and @xmath175 expressed in boyer - lindquist coordinates are @xmath176 @xmath177    it is useful to introduce the particle accretion rate @xmath178 which , owing to the particle number conservation , does not depend on the radial coordinate @xmath47 .",

    "we start from the expression @xmath181 for the number of particles the worldlines of which cross a hypersurface @xmath127 . defining the hypersurface at rest as a cylinder of radius @xmath47 and height @xmath179 and by making use of the axial symmetry and the continuity equation ( [ eq101 ] ) integrated over the disk volume , we find @xmath182 using ( [ eq011 ] ) we obtain @xmath183    thus , the two conditions @xmath184 @xmath185 together with the equation of state , fully determine the kinematics of the accretion disk .",
    "in other words , given the equation of state , e.g. , in the form of ( [ eq216 ] ) , the metric and a set of parameters \\{@xmath186 } , the flow variables @xmath187 and @xmath36 may be determined as functions of @xmath47 .      in this work ,",
    "we concentrate only on axisymmetric fluid accretion , for which the orbital angular momentum of the entire disc plane remains aligned with the angular momentum of the compact object at the origin . in a strongly coupled binary system ( with a compact object as one of the components )",
    ", accretion may experience a non - axisymmetric potential because the secondary donor star exerts a tidal force on the accretion disc round the compact primary .",
    "in general , a non - axisymmetric tilted disc may form if the accretion takes place out of the symmetry plane of the spinning compact object .",
    "the matter in such a misaligned disc will experience a torque due to the general relativistic lense - thirring effect @xcite , leading to the precession of the inner disc plane .",
    "the differential precession may cause stress and dissipative effects in the disc .",
    "if the torque remains strong enough compared with the internal viscous force , the inner region of the initially tilted disc may be forced to realign itself with the symmetry plane of the central accretor .",
    "this phenomenon of partial realignment , out to a certain radial distance known as the _ transition radius _ or the _ alignment radius _ , of the initially non - axisymmetric disc is known as the `` bardeen - petterson effect '' @xcite .",
    "the transition radius can be obtained by balancing the precession and the inward drift or the viscous time scale .",
    "an astrophysical accretion disc subject to the bardeen - petterson effect becomes _ twisted _ or _",
    "warped_. a large scale twist in the disc modifies the emergent spectrum and can influence the direction of the quasar and micro - quasar jets emanating out from the inner region of the accretion disc @xcite .",
    "a twisted disc may be thought of as an ensemble of rings of increasing radii , for which the variation of the direction of the orbital angular momentum occurs smoothly while crossing the alignment radius .",
    "a system of equations describing such a twisted disc has been formulated @xcite , and the time scale required for a kerr black hole to align its angular momentum with that of the initially misaligned accretion disc , has been estimated @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations using the three - dimensional newtonian smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code @xcite as well as a fully relativistic framework @xcite reveal the geometric structure of twisted discs .",
    "note , however , that as long as the acoustic horizon forms at a radial length scale smaller than that of the alignment radius , typically of order 100 - 1000 schwarzschild radii according to the original estimate of bardeen and petterson @xcite , one need not implement the non - axisymmetric geometry to study the analogue effects .",
    "the flow considered here may be regarded as a relativistic generalization of the two - dimensional draining bathtub flow with a sink at the origin . instead of a sink , at the origin we have an astrophysical black hole or a neutron star playing the role of the sink .",
    "hence , our accretion flow is a general - relativistic black - hole analogue .    in the axially symmetric flow ,",
    "the acoustic horizon is a stationary circle of radius @xmath118 where , according to ( [ eq208 ] ) , the radial component of the flow experiences a transition from a subsonic to a supersonic region .",
    "as we shall shortly demonstrate , in our perfect polytropic gas model such a transition may be realized in three ways :    smooth transition : :    both @xmath36 and @xmath187 and their    derivatives are regular at the transition point . in this case , the    transition point is called _ regular sonic point _ or simply _",
    "sonic    point_. the points known in the literature as _ saddle_-type or x - type    critical points belong to this class .",
    "the isolated sonic points known    as _ centre_-type or o - type also belong to this class .",
    "singular transition : :    both @xmath36 and @xmath187 are continuous but    their derivatives diverge .",
    "the transition point is called _",
    "singular    sonic point_. discontinuity : :    both @xmath36 and @xmath187 are discontinuous    as a consequence of discontinuity in the equation of state .",
    "the point    of discontinuity is called _",
    "shock_.    the second and the third case are consequences of the idealization of assuming an _ irrotational inviscid perfect fluid_. in reality , the divergences will be absent because one or more simplifications become invalid as @xmath187 approaches @xmath36 or at a shock .",
    "however , the mathematical divergences indicate that the corresponding divergent physical quantities , such as analogue surface gravity , may in a real physical situation be much larger than previously expected @xcite .",
    "to find solutions with at least one regular sonic point , we take the derivative of ( [ eq210 ] ) and ( [ eq211 ] ) with respect to @xmath47 , which yields @xmath188 @xmath189 substituting @xmath190 and @xmath191 from ( [ eq210 ] ) and ( [ eq211 ] ) and using ( [ eq213 ] ) , equations ( [ eq301 ] ) and ( [ eq302 ] ) may be written as a system of linear algebraic equations for @xmath192 and @xmath193 @xmath194 @xmath195 obviously , the determinant of the system vanishes at the acoustic horizon owing to ( [ eq208 ] ) .",
    "the system will have a regular solution at the horizon if and only if the right - hand sides of the two equations become equal at the horizon . in this case , the algebraic system ( [ eq304])-([eq305 ] ) degenerates at the horizon into one equation .",
    "hence , the condition @xmath196 must hold at the horizon . if this condition is not satisfied , any solution to ( [ eq304])-([eq305 ] ) will have no acoustic horizon at all or will have _ irregular _ acoustic horizons , i.e. , such that the derivatives @xmath197 and @xmath198 approach infinity as one approaches the horizon .",
    "the regularity condition ( [ eq215 ] ) gives @xmath36 at the horizon in terms of @xmath118 but the actual value of @xmath118 is yet unknown .",
    "to find @xmath118 , we need to specify the equation of state . given the equation of state , we can express @xmath199 in terms of @xmath36 , substitute @xmath36 from ( [ eq215 ] ) into ( [ eq211 ] ) and thus obtain an equation for @xmath47 .",
    "for example , equation ( [ eq217 ] ) , which follows from the polytropic equation of state ( [ eq216 ] ) , yields @xmath200 a solution to this equation for fixed @xmath162 and @xmath168 determines the horizon radius @xmath118 .",
    "equation ( [ eq218 ] ) may , in general , have more than one solution . however , not all real solutions are physically acceptable .",
    "the positivity of @xmath201 in ( [ eq003 ] ) requires @xmath202 for a given @xmath162 , this inequality fixes the range of acceptable @xmath47 .",
    "once we have @xmath118 and @xmath36 at the horizon , the constant @xmath203 may also be fixed from equation ( [ eq210 ] ) evaluated at the horizon .",
    "equations ( [ eq210 ] ) and ( [ eq211 ] ) then determine the radial dependence of @xmath36 and @xmath187 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this procedure determines only a subset of solutions to equations ( [ eq210 ] ) and ( [ eq211 ] ) ( or equivalently ( [ eq304 ] ) and ( [ eq305 ] ) ) which possess sonic points that satisfy the condition ( [ eq215 ] )",
    ". any other solution will have singular sonic points or no sonic point at all .",
    "this may be seen in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] where two typical sets of solutions with different topology depending critically on @xmath162 are plotted for a fixed @xmath204 .",
    "solutions are expressed in terms of the so - called mach number defined as the ratio @xmath205 .",
    "the curves crossing the @xmath206 line are transonic and the crossing points are the location of the acoustic horizon .",
    "the plots also include the configurations that do not satisfy ( [ eq215 ] ) at the acoustic horizon .",
    "the plots describe both wind and accretion , depending on the sign of @xmath178 or equivalently of @xmath187 .",
    "each line on the plot represents wind if @xmath207 ( @xmath208 ) or accretion if @xmath209 ( @xmath210 ) .",
    "the flow described by line ( a ) has an x - type sonic point .",
    "the flow marked by ( b ) has two branches , each passing an x - type and ending at a singular sonic point .",
    "an isolated o - type sonic point is marked by ( c ) .",
    "obviously , a smooth flow will have at most one regular sonic point .. hence , a smooth multitransonic flow is not possible .",
    "however , a multitransonic flow with two sonic points and a shock in between may be realized if discontinuous transitions between different lines are allowed .",
    "the lines in the plots in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] in general correspond to different constants @xmath203 and if the entropy is conserved , there is no way to jump from one line to another .",
    "however , instead of keeping the constant @xmath146 fixed , we fix @xmath203 and allow @xmath146 to vary from line to line . in this way",
    "the jumps between the lines labelled by different @xmath146 will be allowed at those points where the rankine - hugoniot conditions are satisfied .    the flows with singular sonic points , i.e. , the points where @xmath197 and @xmath198 diverge , will formally have acoustic horizons with infinite surface gravity .",
    "this property is generic for inviscid flows @xcite and the problem will not appear in a realistic fluid with viscosity . in our case , owing to the shock formation , the flow will actually never reach these points .",
    "we assume that a stationary accretion flow goes from infinity where it is subsonic to the first unstable orbit of the black hole . in the example",
    "depicted in figure [ fig1 ] the flow represented by line ( a ) passes through a regular sonic point . if the rankine - hugoniot conditions are met , a jump from a supersonic to a subsonic regime will take place , provided the entropy of the subsonic flow is larger .",
    "since @xmath211 , the entropy per particle @xmath151 , which increases with @xmath146 according to ( [ eq322 ] ) , increases going from line ( a ) towards the point denoted by ( c ) and hence , a jump from ( a ) to ( b ) or to any of the closed loops inside loop ( b ) is possible .",
    "however , the only transition that will eventually result in a stable stationary flow will be a jump from ( a ) to the subsonic branch of ( b ) .",
    "a flow with a similar transition from ( a ) to one of the closed loops will inevitably end up at a singular sonic point , and hence can not remain stationary .",
    "the exact location of the shock @xmath212 for a particular flow configuration may be calculated using the rankine - hugoniot conditions ( [ eq401])-([eq403 ] ) assuming that the outer flow is described by ( a ) and the inner flow by the subsonic branch of ( b ) .",
    "the first two conditions ( [ eq401 ] ) and ( [ eq402 ] ) are trivially satisfied owing to equations ( [ eq210 ] ) and ( [ eq211 ] ) .",
    "the particle number conservation ( [ eq210 ] ) across the shock may be written as @xmath213 where the subscripts 1 and 2 denote , respectively , the inner and outer boundary values at the shock and @xmath214 is a kinematic quantity the change of which across the shock depends on the change of @xmath187 and @xmath36 only .",
    "hence , to make the particle number conserved , a discontinuity of @xmath215 is compensated by a corresponding discontinuity of @xmath146 such that equation ( [ eq404 ] ) holds . as a consequence",
    ", the entropy per particle @xmath151 being a continuous function of @xmath146 is not conserved across the shock . the third rankine - hugoniot condition ( [ eq403 ] )",
    "may now be written as @xmath216 \\left ( \\frac{{\\cal k}_1}{{\\cal k}_2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\gamma-1 } } , \\label{eq406}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and may be solved for @xmath47 . in figures",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] we show the solutions for the accretion and wind , respectively , corresponding to the flows depicted in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "the two possible locations of the shock are shown by vertical lines at @xmath217 and @xmath218 with arrows indicating the flow orientation . according to a standard local stability analysis @xcite",
    ", one can show for a multitransonic accretion that only the shock formed in between the middle ( indicated by ( c ) in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) and the outer sonic point is stable .",
    "hence , in our accretion example in figure [ fig3 ] , the shock at @xmath218 is stable and the one at @xmath217 is unstable .",
    "the geometric aspects of the axially symmetric accretion are conveniently described in terms of the acoustic metric defined by ( [ eq029 ] ) and the metric discriminant @xmath219 defined by ( [ eq209 ] ) . in figure [ fig00 ]",
    "we plot the components of the metric tensor as functions of @xmath47 calculated using equation ( [ eq029 ] ) for the transonic accretion flow represented by the solid line in figure [ fig3 ] and similarly in [ fig00b ] for the transonic wind of figure [ fig4 ] . for the same flow configurations depicted in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] we also plot @xmath219 as a function of @xmath47 in figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , respectively .",
    "clearly , @xmath219 is positive ( negative ) in the subsonic ( supersonic ) region .",
    "acoustic horizons are located at the points where the discriminant changes its sign . depending on the slope of @xmath219 at these points passing in the direction of the flow , we call them acoustic _ black hole _ ( if the slope is descending ) or _ white hole _ ( if the slope is ascending ) horizons .",
    "indeed , for both the multitransonic accretion ( figure [ fig3 ] ) and the wind ( figure [ fig4 ] ) , the flow at the inner and the outer sonic points denoted by @xmath220 and @xmath221 , respectively , goes from subsonic to supersonic ; so , according to the classification of barcel et al @xcite , there we have acoustic black hole horizons . at the discontinuity @xmath217 or @xmath218 the flow goes from supersonic to subsonic and",
    "hence observers in the subsonic region of the accretion ( between @xmath220 and @xmath218 in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig5 ] ) , and of the wind ( between @xmath217 and @xmath221 in figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig6 ] ) experience a white hole .    in figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ]",
    "we also plot the metric component @xmath222 as a function of @xmath47 ( represented by the dashed line ) .",
    "the point @xmath223 where @xmath222 changes its sign is the radius of the stationary limit surface and the boundary of the acoustic ergo region .    in order to study the causal structure of the axially symmetric acoustic geometry ,",
    "let us introduce retarded and advanced radial null coordinates @xmath224 and @xmath199 , respectively .",
    "we first make a transformation to the acoustic corotating frame by eliminating the term @xmath225 from the acoustic metric .",
    "this is achieved by transforming @xmath226 to @xmath227 as @xmath228 with the remaining coordinates unchanged .",
    "this yields the acoustic metric @xmath229 where @xmath230 @xmath231 with all remaining components of the acoustic metric unchanged .",
    "we then make the transformation @xmath232 @xmath233 where @xmath234 the acoustic metric at constant @xmath227 is then given by @xmath235 the functions @xmath236 at constant @xmath224 or constant @xmath199 , obtained by integrating @xmath237 represent , respectively , the right - moving and left - moving sound rays or _",
    "null - rays _ @xcite .    in figures",
    "[ fig0 ] and [ fig0b ] we plot the @xmath238 and @xmath239 lines for the accretion of figure [ fig3 ] and the wind of figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the divergence of lines at the acoustic horizons towards @xmath240 demonstrate an acoustic black hole . since the transition from a supersonic to a subsonic region is discontinuous at the shock , the lines have a cusp pointing in the direction of positive @xmath241 .",
    "if the transition at the shock were smooth , the null lines would diverge towards @xmath242 as in the white - hole example of barcel et al @xcite .",
    "hence , the cusp indicates a white hole .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of acoustic horizons is the existence of a surface gravity and the associated hawking radiation . to calculate the analogue surface gravity , we need the derivatives @xmath198 and @xmath197 at the acoustic horizon .",
    "let us consider a regular sonic point , e.g. , at @xmath220 or @xmath221 in figures [ fig3]-[fig6 ] , first .",
    "the case of shock will be discussed afterwards . to calculate @xmath198 and @xmath197 at a regular sonic point , we have to solve two equations .",
    "the first one is obtained combining ( [ eq304 ] ) and the derivative of ( [ eq217 ] ) : @xmath243 the second equation is obtained by eliminating @xmath192 from ( [ eq304 ] ) and ( [ eq305 ] ) and taking the derivative with respect to @xmath47 of the equation thus obtained at the horizon .",
    "we find @xmath244 equations ( [ eq214 ] ) and ( [ eq220 ] ) can now be easily solved for @xmath198 and @xmath197 .",
    "the analogue surface gravity @xmath94 may be calculated with help of the killing field @xmath140 that is null on the horizon .",
    "we start from the expression @xcite @xmath245 where @xmath246 denotes the normal derivative at the horizon .",
    "since the definition of surface gravity by equation ( [ eq141 ] ) is conformally invariant @xcite , in the calculations that follow we drop the conformal factor @xmath98 in @xmath64 .",
    "consider the vector field @xmath28 defined by ( [ eq237 ] ) .",
    "its magnitude in the acoustic metric is given by @xmath247= \\gamma_{\\perp}^2 ( c_s^2-v_{\\perp}^2 ) .",
    "\\label{eq046}\\ ] ] hence , the vector @xmath28 is null on the horizon .",
    "we now construct a killing vector @xmath140 in the form @xmath248 where the killing vectors @xmath249 and @xmath165 are the generators of the temporal and axial isometry group , respectively .",
    "it may be easily verified that if the constant @xmath250 coincides with the angular velocity ( [ eq001 ] ) evaluated at the acoustic horizon , then @xmath140 becomes parallel to @xmath28 and hence null on the horizon .",
    "using @xmath251 and the definition ( [ eq237 ] ) we find @xmath252 at the horizon .",
    "equation ( [ eq141 ] ) , together with ( [ eq046 ] ) and ( [ eq153 ] ) yields @xmath253 where it is understood that the derivatives and the quantity @xmath254 are to be taken at the horizon .",
    "the corresponding hawking temperature @xmath255 represents the temperature as measured by an observer near infinity . for @xmath256 , equation ( [ eq043 ] ) reduces to ( [ eq238 ] ) derived in a different way for a nonrotating fluid in a static background metric .",
    "the norm of the killing vector @xmath257 is easily calculated from ( [ eq147 ] ) using ( [ eq002 ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath258    we plot the ratio of the analogue hawking temperature @xmath259 to the black hole hawking temperature @xmath260 at the inner and outer horizons as a function of the black - hole specific angular momentum @xmath9 ( figure [ fig7 ] ) and of the disk specific angular momentum @xmath162 ( figure [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the solid and dashed lines represent the two topologies of figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , respectively .",
    "however , whereas the inner and the outer acoustic horizons for the topology of figure [ fig1 ] belong to the same multitransonic flow connected by a shock ( the typical configuration depicted in figure [ fig3 ] ) , the horizons for the topology of figure [ fig2 ] belong to disconnected transonic flows marked by ( a ) and ( b ) in figure [ fig2 ] . amazingly , the analogue surface gravity is smooth at the topological transition point .",
    "note that the analogue hawking temperature @xmath259 of the outer horizon is much lower than the temperature @xmath259 of the inner horizon , which in turn is , although close in magnitude , typically lower than the black hole hawking temperature @xmath260 .",
    "this is due to the relatively low specific energy @xmath261 , barely exceeding the rest mass . for a range of larger values of @xmath168 ,",
    "e.g. , close to 2 , the temperature @xmath259 would exceed @xmath260 as in the spherically symmetric accretion @xcite .",
    "however , we have found that in this range of large specific energies a multitransonic behaviour is absent .",
    "calculation of the surface gravity at the shock is not possible in the present model with no viscosity .",
    "the shock may be viewed as a boundary separating two phases of the fluid .",
    "the equation of state , and hence the sound speed , as well as the radial component of the fluid velocity , in each phase are different and exhibit discontinuity at the boundary . as a consequence , the surface gravity and",
    "the associated hawking temperature at the shock will be formally infinite .",
    "however , in a more realistic situation , the phase boundary , owing to viscosity , will have a finite thickness and discontinuities will be smoothed out .",
    "the gradients of @xmath187 and @xmath36 will actually be finite but possibly very large .",
    "a similar situation occurs in a non - relativistic acoustic setup in which the boundary of a stable - phase bubble propagates in the surrounding metastable phase @xcite and in the @xmath262he - a superfluid where a superluminally moving domain wall soliton provides an analogue event horizon @xcite .",
    "the existence of an ergo region in the transonic accretion flow as described in sections [ acoustic ] and [ causal ] suggests the possibility of _",
    "acoustic superradiance_. acoustic waves entering the ergo region and reflecting from the outer acoustic horizon may experience a coefficient of reflection greater than 1 .",
    "this effect is a close analogue of superradiant scattering @xcite which allows energy extraction from kerr black holes .",
    "acoustic superradiance has recently been extensively discussed in the context of the draining bathtub @xcite and its application to the bose - einstein condensate @xcite .",
    "the quantitative investigation of acoustic superradiance in the accretion disc geometry may be performed in the usual way : first , the variables in ( [ eq028 ] ) may be separated using a cylindrical wave ansatz @xmath263 where @xmath264 is real and positive and @xmath144 a positive integer .",
    "equation ( [ eq028 ] ) then reduces to an ordinary second - order differential equation for @xmath265 which may be solved numerically for suitable boundary conditions .",
    "however , this calculation may be quite involved for the transonic flow described in sections [ acoustic ] and [ causal ] and would go beyond the scope of this paper . instead",
    ", we would like to demonstrate here that the acoustic superradiance occurs in a relativistic transonic axisymmetric flow if @xmath266 where @xmath250 is the flow angular velocity ( [ eq001 ] ) evaluated at the acoustic horizon . to show this",
    ", we follow the procedure outlined in @xcite .    using the stress tensor ( [ eq329 ] ) and the stationary killing vector @xmath42 we first construct the analogue",
    " energy current \" @xmath267 which is conserved , i.e. which satisfies @xmath268 , @xmath269 being the covariant derivative associated with @xmath64 .",
    "hence if we integrate @xmath270 over the region @xmath271 with the boundary @xmath272 , we find by gauss s law @xmath273 where we have chosen @xmath272 such that it consists of the cylinder @xmath274 of large radius @xmath275 and height @xmath276 , the disc @xmath277 at the bottom of the cylinder extended from the outer acoustic horizon radius @xmath118 to @xmath278 , the time translated disk @xmath279 at the top , and the part @xmath280 of the outer acoustic horizon @xmath281 between @xmath277 and @xmath279 .",
    "the integrals over @xmath277 and @xmath279 cancel by time symmetry , the integral over @xmath274 represents the net energy flow out of @xmath271 to infinity , i.e. , the difference between the outgoing and incoming energies @xmath282 during the time @xmath276 , whereas the integral over @xmath280 represents the net energy flow into the acoustic black hole .",
    "thus we have @xmath283 where we have used @xmath284 as the outward directed normal to the horizon and @xmath140 is given by ( [ eq147 ] ) .",
    "the integral in ( [ eq159 ] ) is taken over the proper volume element @xmath285 on the acoustic horizon .",
    "using @xmath286 which follows directly from ( [ eq153 ] ) , a straightforward algebra yields @xmath287 applying this to ( [ eq155 ] ) it follows from ( [ eq159 ] ) that the time averaged energy flux across the horizon is given by @xmath288 where @xmath289 is the proper  area \" of the horizon .",
    "thus , in the frequency range of equation ( [ eq156 ] ) , the energy loss across the horizon is negative and hence superradiance is obtained .",
    "in this paper we have studied the phenomena related to the acoustic geometry of the axially symmetric accretion flow .",
    "we have discussed the formation of the shock and acoustic horizons using a general relativistic formalism in a model of the flow based on a perfect polytropic gas . we have found that a multitransonic flow can form with two sonic points and a shock in between .",
    "null curves depicted in figures [ fig0 ] and [ fig0b ] clearly demonstrate the presence of the acoustic black hole at regular sonic points and of the white hole at the shock .",
    "multitransonic accretion happens for a range of values of the specific energy density not much exceeding the rest mass .",
    "the analogue hawking temperature of the inner horizon , calculated for a typical set of physical parameters , is lower but close in magnitude to the black - hole hawking temperature .",
    "however , at the middle horizon that forms at the shock location , the surface gravity is formally infinite owing to discontinuities in the speed of sound and the radial velocity .",
    "we expect that in a realistic fluid with viscosity , discontinuity will be removed and replaced by a steep slope resulting in a finite but possibly very high analogue hawking temperature .",
