    "the study of superconducting fluctuations above the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath3 , in iron - based superconductors @xcite has gain increasing attention @xcite , as these effects extend up to relatively large temperatures above @xmath3 , when compared with low-@xmath3 superconductors.@xcite these enhanced fluctuations as observed in pnictides are due to their layered structure in conjunction with their relatively large @xmath3 , large values of the ginzburg - landau ( g - l ) parameter , @xmath9 , and large values of the upper critical field , @xmath10 ( low values of the coherence length ) . studies of superconducting fluctuations , near and above @xmath3 , allow to compare experiments with available theoretical predictions for critical and gaussian fluctuations in superconductors .",
    "as fluctuations are sensitive to the pairing symmetry , it is of particular interest to study pnictides , for which multi - band ( inter - band ) levels participate in the pairing @xcite producing a @xmath11 symmetry ( the symmetry is still not clear , and seems to depend on the doping @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , a recent theoretical work taking into account the characteristic inter - band pairing of the pnictides and a @xmath11 symmetry @xcite predicted that conductivity fluctuations should exhibit only one critical regime , while two critical regimes are expected near @xmath3 for a s - wave pairing ( a statical one , followed by a dynamical).@xcite superconducting fluctuations can also provide information on the system dimensionality .",
    "analysis of critical and gaussian fluctuations in the studied pnictides in the literature appears to support a three dimensional , 3d , behavior @xcite but two dimensional behavior was observed for higher fields ( above 8 t ) in smfeas system @xcite and in lifeas @xcite , and a recent theory of critical fluctuations was specially developed for pnictides considering an intermediated dimensionality between two and three for high applied magnetic fields which seems to explain high - field experimental data as well.@xcite    the ginzburg criterium which defines the temperature width of critical fluctuations close to @xmath3 can be estimated by the relation @xmath12",

    "conductivity fluctuations above the surperconducting transition temperature , also known as excess conductivity or paraconductivity , have been widely theoretically and experimentally studied in most of known superconductors @xcite , including earlier works studying gaussian fluctuations at zero magnetic field within the well known aslamazov - larkin , a - l , theory.@xcite in more recent experimental works performed in the presence of magnetic fields , fluctuation effects are interpreted in terms of extensions of the a - l theory @xcite when in the gaussian regime , and , near the transition temperature , by scaling - laws derived from g - l theories which include correlations in the fluctuation regime , then critical.@xcite for pnictides , magneto - conductivity studies were performed in smfeaso @xcite , fluor doped smfeaso @xcite , ( nd , pr)feaso @xcite , ( nd , pr , sm)feaso @xcite , bafe@xmath19co@xmath20as@xmath2 @xcite , ba@xmath7k@xmath20fe@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite , laofeas @xcite , lifeas @xcite and in bafe@xmath19ni@xmath8as@xmath2 @xcite . for most of these studies",

    "<S> we study fluctuation conductivity in a single crystal of bafe@xmath0ni@xmath1as@xmath2 superconductor ( @xmath3 = 20 k ) as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> magneto - conductivity curves , @xmath4 vs. @xmath5 , were analyzed in terms of -1/(dln(@xmath4)/d@xmath5 ) vs. @xmath5 plots , which allow to study different fluctuations regimes and to estimate exponent values and temperature widths of each regime . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of magneto - conductivity curves evidence the existence of only two fluctuations regimes , a possible critical one ( of glass - like type ) going from the irreversible temperature to above @xmath6 followed by aslamazov - larkin fluctuations in the gaussian regime .    </S>",
