    "binaries are characterized by `` the union of two stars , that are formed together in one system , by the laws of attraction '' ( herschel 1802 ) .",
    "they from the basic building blocks of the milky way as galaxies are the building blocks of the universe . in the absence of binaries",
    "many astrophysical phenomena would not exist and the galaxy would look completely different over the entire spectral range . a considerable fraction of the astrophysical community would be unemployed , doppler ( 1842 ) would not have written his famous paper , herschel s nearest neighbor distribution of field stars would look different .",
    "even life as we know it would not have evolved in the universe as type ia supernovae , which enrich the interstellar medium with elements required to enable life , would not occur .",
    "let s assume that the galaxy contains only single stars and that the evolution of a single star passes through three stages ; main - sequence ( ms ) , giant ( gs ) and remnant , which again we subdivide into white dwarf ( wd ) and neutron star ( ns ) , black holes are neglected here .",
    "table[tab : single ] presents the distribution of stars over these subtypes at different times during the lifetime of the galaxy if all stars were born at the same time ( columns 25 ) and if the star formation was constant for the last 10gyr ( column 6 ) .",
    "we assumed that the initial mass function is given by the distribution proposed by scalo ( 1986 ) between 0.1and 100 .",
    "calculations were performed with the  population synthesis code ( portegies zwart & verbunt 1996 , see the starlab software tool set http://www.sns.ias.edu/@xmath0starlab ) .",
    ".stellar types and total mass as a function of time .",
    "calculation are performed with @xmath1 stars , but the numbers are rescaled to 100 stars . the first column gives the stellar type followed by the normalized number of stars of that type at zero age , 100myr , 1gyr and 10gyr after formation .",
    "the last column gives the stellar population if the star formation rate was constant over 10gyr .",
    "the bottom line gives total mass in .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      table[tab : evolution ] shows that various groups obtain quite different results from identical initial conditions ( see also verbunt 1996 , who performed a similar comparison between two models ) .",
    "the conservative case is most radically different , indicating that all groups agree that the evolution of such a binary should proceed rather inconservative .",
    "the other extreme in this example is provided by the scenario machine of lipunov et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in which case the accreting star hardly gains any mass but most mass is ejected from the binary system ( last three columns ) . the large period after mass transfer indicates that little angular momentum is carried with the lost material .",
    "( the change in orbital period can be reconstructed assuming that mass lost from the binary carries 0.71 times the specific angular momentum of the binary system , which is about the specific angular momentum of the accreting star at the onset of the mass transfer . )",
    "this model results in a single thorne-@xmath2ytkow object ( a giant with a neutron star core ) after the second phase of mass transfer .",
    "the two models in the middle of table[tab : evolution ] ( tutukov & yungelson and ) both lead to a neutron star binary . in these cases",
    "the intermediate stages of the binaries , however , are quite different ; the binary in the ty93 model remains rather close , where results in a much wider intermediate state .",
    "so in the ty93 case , more mass is lost carrying , on average , more angular momentum . in mass",
    "leaves the binary system with 3 times the specific angular momentum of the binary ; applying this prescription to the model of ty93 we find that @xmath3 times the angular momentum of the binary system is lost per unit mass .",
    "note however , that ty93 use a completely different treatment of non - conservative mass transfer .",
    "the differences in the treatement of the common envelope in the second phase of mass transfer makes that the final binaries computed with the ty93 and models are very similar .",
    "the differences between the calculations presented in table[tab : evolution ] are rather big but can be brought back to a few assumptions about the mass transfer .",
    "these assumptions determine 1 ) the fraction of mass that is accreted by the companion star during mass transfer , 2 ) the amount of specific angular momentum which is carried away with the mass that leaves the binary system .",
    "even bigger differences are expected from introducing new physics in the models , which may lead to unexplored channels for the formation of various types of binaries or to completely new classes of objects .",
    "an example is the model in which a neutron star in a common envelope accretes a significant fraction of this envelope .",
    "this causes the neutron star to grow in mass until it exceeds the stability limit and collapses into a low - mass black hole ( chevalier & kirsner 1979 ) .",
    "bethe & brown ( 1998 ) used this new understanding to calculate the number of neutron star binaries in the galaxy with an analytic model .",
    "the computer powered population calculations of portegies zwart & yungelson ( 1998 ) gave identical numbers for the models with similar assumptions ( see their model @xmath4 ) .",
    "the agreement between the two completely different techniques indicates that the uncertainties in binary population synthesis are mainly caused by differences in the assumption about the underlying physics and in a lesser extent in the proper choice of various key parameters . by lack of a proper understanding of some of the background physics",
    "these parameters are , for now , to be adjusted such that the observed binaries can be explained .    *",
