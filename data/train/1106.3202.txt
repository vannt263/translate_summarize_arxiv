    "special smarandache curves have been investigated by some differential geometers [ 1,8 ] . a regular curve in minkowski space - time",
    ", whose position vector is composed by frenet frame vectors on another regular curve , is called a _",
    "smarandache  curve_. m. turgut and s. yilmaz have defined a special case of such curves and call it _ smarandache _",
    "@xmath0 _ curves _ in the space @xmath1 [ 8 ] .",
    "they have dealed with a special smarandache curves which is defined by the tangent and second binormal vector fields .",
    "they have called such curves as _ smarandache _ @xmath0 _ _  curves__. additionally , they have computed formulas of this kind curves by the method expressed in [ 10 ] .",
    "a. t. ali has introduced some special smarandache curves in the euclidean space .",
    "he has studied frenet - serret invariants of a special case [ 1 ] .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate special smarandache curves such as _ smarandache curves _ @xmath2 _ _ , _ _ @xmath3 _ _ , _ _ @xmath4 _ _  and _ _ @xmath5 according to bishop frame in euclidean 3-space .",
    "furthermore , we find differential geometric properties of these special curves and we calculate first and second curvature ( natural curvatures ) of these curves . also we find the centers of the curvature spheres and osculating spheres of smarandache curves .",
    "the bishop frame or parallel transport frame is an alternative approach to defining a moving frame that is well defined even when the curve has vanishing second derivative .",
    "we can parallel transport an orthonormal frame along a curve simply by parallel transporting each component of the frame .",
    "the parallel transport frame is based on the observation that , while @xmath6 for a given curve model is unique , we may choose any convenient arbitrary basis @xmath7 for the remainder of the frame , so long as it is in the normal plane perpendicular to @xmath8 at each point . if the derivatives of @xmath7 depend only on @xmath8 and not each other we can make @xmath9 and @xmath10 vary smoothly throughout the path regardless of the curvature [ 2,6,7 ] .    in addition , suppose the curve @xmath11 is an arclength - parametrized @xmath12 curve .",
    "suppose we have @xmath13 unit vector fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xmath14 along the curve @xmath11 so that@xmath16i.e . , @xmath17 @xmath18 will be a smoothly varying right - handed orthonormal frame as we move along the curve .",
    "( to this point , the frenet frame would work just fine if the curve were @xmath19 with @xmath20 ) but now we want to impose the extra condition that @xmath21 .",
    "we say the unit first normal vector field @xmath14 is parallel along the curve @xmath22 this means that the only change of @xmath23 is in the direction of @xmath17 .",
    "a bishop frame can be defined even when a frenet frame can not ( e.g. , when there are points with @xmath24 ) .",
    "therefore , we have the alternative frame equations@xmath25 = \\left [   \\begin{array}{ccc } 0 & k_{1 } & k_{2 } \\\\   -k_{1 } & 0 & 0 \\\\   -k_{2 } & 0 & 0% \\end{array}% \\right ] \\left [   \\begin{array}{l } t \\\\",

    "the orientation of the parallel transport frame includes the arbitrary choice of integration constant @xmath32 , which disappears from @xmath33 ( and hence from the frenet frame ) due to the differentiation [ 2,6,7 ] .",
    "bishop curvatures are defined by@xmath34and@xmath35[9 ] .",
    "in [ 1 ] , author gave following definitions :    let @xmath36 be a unit speed regular curve in @xmath37 and @xmath38 be its moving serret - frenet frame .",
