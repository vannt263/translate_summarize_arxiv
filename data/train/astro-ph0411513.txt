    "the giant outburst from sgr1900 + 14 on 27 august ( 1998 ) , hereafter grb980827 , was an extraordinary event in many respects . aside from the huge energy released ( @xmath2  erg ) on such a short timescale ( @xmath3  s ) , the clear identification in its light curve ( and power spectral density ) of a main pulsation period ( @xmath4  s ) and an accurately measure interpulse set ( @xmath5  s of interval ) , as discovered by bepposax ( feroci et al .",
    "1999 ) , has challenged the current views on sgrs .",
    "this behavior , feroci et al .",
    "( 1999 ) advanced , is unexpected and quite difficult to explain in the magnetar framework .",
    "the grb980827 subpulses seem to be _ overtones _ of the fundamental frequency @xmath6  hz ( feroci et al . 1999 ) . as shown by mosquera cuesta ( 2004b ) , where a consistent scenario to explain the observed sgr1900 + 14 modulations was presented , when looking at the grb980827 lightcurve perhaps we are seeing the full wd pulsation spectrum . in these lines",
    ", it would be crucial if the _ propeller model _ by marsden , rothschild & lingenfelter ( 2001 ) and alpar ( 1999,2000 ) could provide a suitable explanation for the pulsational modes observed in grb980827 , since this way we can discriminate among accretion models .    the rapid risetime ( 0.25  s ) , energetics and subpulses seen by bepposax in this powerful event are characteristics challenging the magnetar view . according to the magnetar scenario",
    "( thompson & duncan 1995,1996 ) the typical ( crustal stored stress ) energy of an outburst from an sgr source should be @xmath7  erg ( de freitas pacheco 1998 ) if one expects the source not to be destroyed by the explosion .",
    "energies as @xmath8 or higher can be obtained at the expense of destructing practically the whole crust of the ns undergoing the starquake ( de freitas pacheco 1998 ) or through magnetic reconnection ( thompson & duncan 1995,1996 ; woods et al . 1999 ) . however",
    ", a ns with no crust is fully unstable , and should explode ( colpi , shapiro & teukolsky 1993 ) .",
    "consequently , the source could not repeat anymore .",
    "the problems for the magnetar model do not stop there . after a burster phase in 1996 , marsden ,",
    "rothschild & lingenfelter ( 1999 , see also harding , contopoulos & kazanas 1999 ; murakami et al .",
    "1999 ) found that the pulsar doubled its period derivative , @xmath9 , which would suggest the pulsar magnetic field energy had augmented @xmath10 during the outburst , what clearly opposes the magnetar scenario .",
    "they concluded that the sgrs spindown is due not to dipole radiation but to another mechanism .",
    "thus , the @xmath9 could not be an estimate of the magnetic field strength , nor evidence for a magnetar .",
    "more recently , rothschild , marsden & lingenfelter ( 2001 ) argued that the unexpected occurrence of most of the sgrs ( and axps ) in the denser phases of the interstellar medium effectively _",
    "rules out _ the magnetar model for their origin , since in that model the ns endowes a supercritical field as an intrinsic property , with no plausible relation to external environments .",
    "in addition to those shortcomings of the magnetar scenario , very recently prez martnez et al .",
    "( 2003 ) rose questions on the formation of the magnetar itself by invoking quantum - mechanical effects on the structural stability of the hypermagnetised star , while rezzolla & akhmedov ( 2004 ) demonstrated that a fundamental change in the pacini s spindown law appears when describing the electromagnetic fields in full general relativity .",
    "then the issue is contentious : what are these objects ?    in this letter we suggest that sgrs may not be related to magnetars , as opposed to claims by kouveliotou et al .",
    "( 1998,1999 ) ; hurley et al .",
    "( 1999a , b , c ) ; murakami et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; mazets et al .",
    "( 1999a , b ) ; etc . instead",
    ", it is shown that sgrs may be extremely close ( tight ) relativistic x - ray binaries with periods near _ a few tens of seconds _ ( see table.1 )  s. no sinusoidal modulation was found . if our model is on the right track , the negative result is not surprising for a shorter period for the sgr 1900 + 14 binary , @xmath11  s , but expected .",
    "thus , it is likely that the orbital signature looked for remains embedded in the data subsets that were used for .",
    "] , in which sparsely the rate of shrinking of the binary separation dominates over the massive wd rate of contraction below its equilibrium radius ( fryer et al .",
    "1998b ) , and mass transfer ensues . to trigger a superoutburst",
    "the system is brought closer again due to gr emission . in a timescale @xmath12",
    "yr the process described above restarts governing the binary dynamics leading to a new outburst .",
    "according to king & ritter ( 1998 ) an interesting by - product of the massive case - b evolution model of cygnus x-2 is that binaries constituted by a massive wd ( @xmath13  m@xmath14 ) and massive rapidly rotating ( _ millisecond _ ) accretion spun up ns ( @xmath15  m@xmath14 ) , with ultrashort orbital periods ( @xmath16 ) can exist for very massive wd companions .",
    "systems with even more shorter , near tens of a second , depending on the common envelope efficiency parameter @xmath17 , can be formed ( see also podsiadlowski 1995,2000 ; ergma , lundgren & cordes 1997 ; tauris , van den heuvel & savonije 2000 ) .",
    "this view gives us some insight on the sgrs former evolution .",
    "perhaps those systems come from a previous thorne - zytkow object in which a complete exhaustion or ejection of the hydrogen - rich envelope of the red giant star ( lifetime @xmath18  yr ) occurred once the ns is engulfed in a common - envelope evolutionary phase caused by shrinking of the orbit due to gravitational - wave ( gw ) radiation - reaction effects .",
    "this process leaves the giant companion s bare helium ( or cno ) core , the wd , in a tight orbit with a rapidly spinning massive ns .",
    "we suggest this may explain why sgrs are surrounded by nebulae resembling supernovae remnants .",
    "the ns high mass being a consequence of the thorne - zytkow object latest stage , while the ns spin stems from its former lmxb evolution ( van paradijs 1995a , b ) .",
    "a similar evolutionary path was described by ergma , lundgren & cordes ( 1997 ) , see also tauris , van den heuvel & savonije ( 2000 ) .",
    "ergma et al . showed that these systems may undergo a second mass transfer transient around periods of 5 minutes or less , being the source observed as an x - ray binary again .",
    "the final fate could be the binary coalescence .",
    "we also note that in the last few years a large number of systems of this sort have been discovered ( edwards & bailes 2001 ; tauris & sennels 2000 ; tauris , van den heuvel & savonije 2000 , a large sample is collected in this reference ; deloye & bildsten 2003 , alcyan & morsink 2004 ) , and their formation have been modelled with great details ( ergma , lundgren & cordes 1997 ; tauris , van den heuvel & savonije 2000 ) . at this late stages",
    "gw dominate the binary dynamics and secularly shorten its period to those we suggest here .",
    ".a set of viable orbital periods , gr timescale and binary separation for the ultracompact relativistic wd - ns binary .",
    "the minimum period compatible with all constraints from sgr1900 + 14 is @xmath19  s.[tbl-0 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     1.25 truecm = 6.6 cm",
    "several gw signals of different nature are expected to be produced in the context of this picture for sgrs . during : a )",

    "\\b ) the inspiraling of a lump of matter that reaches the disk at a radius @xmath20  km ; the equilibrium distance from the ns , c ) the plunging of the inner tdd , after crossing the isco , onto the millisecond ns .",
    "this will shake the ns and its ( _ fluid - modes _ ) , d ) wd non - radial pulsations , and e ) the ns spinning or wobbling .",
    "some of them having characteristics so as to make it detectable even with today s bars . for the sake of definiteness , we compute here the characteristics of the gw burst released during the brief inspiraling ( timescale @xmath21 ) of a disk  blob \" till finding the isco .",
    "the gw amplitude reads ( mosquera cuesta et al .",
    "1998 )    ^2 = ( ) ,    with the gw energy @xmath22 . the gw luminosity    l_gw ~(g/5c^5 ) ,    where @xmath23  cm is the radius of gyration of the matter in the disk .",
    "this yields @xmath24 for a source distance of 5.7 kpc ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "the gw frequency is given by @xmath25 .",
    "a gw signal such as this from sgr 1900 + 14 during the grb980827 energetic outburst could have been detected by interferometers such as ligo , virgo and geo-600 were they operatives , but may be detected in the future . in passing ,",
    "it worths to quote that since the conditions for gws resonant excitation ( ferrari et al . 2000 ) of the stars fluid modes ( mainly the wd , @xmath26 ) a continuous gws emission could also be enhanced in this extremely close binary .",
    "this issue will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "an observationally consistent scenario to explain the detected modulations from sgr 1900 + 14 is discussed in the accompanying paper by mosquera cuesta ( 2004b ) . in that paper",
    "is also provided a viable origin for the secular sgrs spindown , and for the up - and - down of their periods .",
    "most of the results are collected in table 2 .",
    "related to those results , we stress that neither ns - ns nor ns - bh binaries can fit the observations of sgrs ( kouveliotou 1998,1999 ; hurley 1999a , b , c ; murakami et al . 1999 ; feroci et al . 1999 ) , since , even for the explosive lower mass limit of colpi , shapiro & teukolsky ( 1993 ) , @xmath27  m @xmath14 , the oscillation frequency of its fundamental mode goes too high ( mcdermott , van horn & hansen 1987 ) due to the ns higher density , so as to explain the relative lower pulsation periods observed in sgrs ( see table[tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , since the maximum mass of a wd is limited to the chandrasekhar mass : @xmath28  m@xmath14 , we expect not to find sgrs with pulsation periods @xmath29  s ( see table[tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "a prediction that agrees with current data , but that is not precluded by the magnetar model .    to conclude , the ns low magnetization in this model places it under the pulsar death line in the @xmath30 diagram , and hence turns sgrs undetectable as binary radio pulsars ; a point confirmed by xilouris et al .",
    "this fact makes the search for an optical and/or infra - red counterpart of sgrs with gemini or keck a timely endeavour .",
    "meanwhile , if our scenario proves correct , a prospective way to study these systems is through the new generation of x - rays telescopes like chandra , xmm - newton , integral , etc . , and gws observatories such as ligo , virgo , tama-300 , geo-600 , the tigas network ( which may follow - up the burster phase ) and lisa ( which may follow - up the orbital dynamics and wd pulsations ) .",
    "when operatives , they will play a decisive role in deciphering the sgrs nature , as perhaps , new general relativistic astrophysical laboratories where wd - ns interacts farther out the weak - field regime .",
    "i thank professors jhon c. miller ( oxford u",
    ".- sissa ) , jos a. de freitas pacheco ( oca - nice ) , jorge e. horvath ( iag - sao paulo ) and luciano rezzolla ( sissa ) for fruitful discussions and insight during the early days of the development of this idea ."

    "<S> a scenario for sgrs is introduced in which gravitational radiation reaction effects drive the dynamics of an ultrashort orbital period x - ray binary embracing a high - mass donor white dwarf ( wd ) to a rapidly rotating low magnetised massive neutron star ( ns ) surrounded by a thick , dense and massive accretion torus . </S>",
    "<S> driven by gr reaction , sparsely , the binary separation reduces , the wd overflows its roche lobe and the mass transfer drives unstable the accretion disk around the ns . as the binary circular orbital period is a multiple integer number ( @xmath0 ) of the period of the wd fundamental mode ( pons et al . 2002 ) , the wd is since long pulsating at its fundamental mode ; and most of its harmonics , due to the tidal interaction with its ns orbital companion . </S>",
    "<S> hence , when the powerful irradiation glows onto the wd ; from the fireball ejected as part of the disk matter slumps onto the ns , it is partially absorbed . </S>",
    "<S> this huge energy excites other wd radial ( @xmath1-mode ) pulsations ( podsiadlowski 1991,1995 ) . </S>",
    "<S> after each mass - transfer episode the binary separation ( and orbital period ) is augmented significantly ( deloye & bildsten 2003 ; alcyan & morsink 2004 ) due to the binary s angular momentum redistribution . </S>",
