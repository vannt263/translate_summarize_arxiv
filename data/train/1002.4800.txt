    "<S> finally , we set @xmath85 and @xmath86 . this is not a crucial approximation but it simplifies the differential equations considerably .    </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that this set of approximations makes a solution of the redfield equation possible and the noise can be calculated using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ macdonald ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> for details , we refer to appendix [ app : noise ] . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting expression @xmath87 contains all entries of the evm with the exception of @xmath88 and @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency - dependence is characterized by the following functions , @xmath90 which contain lorentz and fano shaped resonances at the characteristic frequencies of the system , @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> the complete expression for the noise reads @xmath92 where @xmath80 denotes all combinations of qubit and oscillator operators contained in the evm ( [ chi ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , it turns out that all except three of the prefactors @xmath93 are nonvanishing and are distinguishable combinations of the functions @xmath94 and @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> results for @xmath93 can be found in appendix [ app : noise ] . a plot of the relevant cross - correlations prefactors is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ noiseplot ] . </S>",
    "<S> since the shapes of these functions are rather distinct , the expectation values constituting the evm can be recovered from the total measurable noise @xmath87 .    beyond the regime @xmath96 </S>",
    "<S> , the born - markov approximation fails and we have to resort to conventional perturbation theory in order to calculate @xmath87 . for the case of a simple tunneling junction , it is well known that @xmath87 has kinks at @xmath97.@xcite in the presence of the oscillator and the qubit , we find that @xmath87 shows similar features at @xmath98 and @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes of these kinks yield additional information about the expectation values @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) . </S>",
    "<S> details are given in appendix [ app : noise ] .    </S>",
    "<S> even under ideal circumstances , not all coefficients of the evm can be determined by a current and noise measurement . </S>",
    "<S> however , it was shown that even incomplete knowledge of the evm allows for the detection of entanglement for experimentally relevant states.@xcite if the evm contains a few unknown parameters @xmath103 , we can only detect entanglement for states where eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ chi_ineq ] ) is violated for arbitrary @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> because of the special structure of the inequalities ( [ chi_ineq ] ) , this numerical problem reduces to a convex optimization problem which can be efficiently solved using semidefinite programming as shown in [ ] . </S>",
    "<S> a route to obtain _ all _ matrix elements of the evm would be to rotate the qubit state by applying @xmath104-pulses using a tunable gate voltage.@xcite    the detection of entanglement based on the evm is highly versatile since it works even for arbitrary mixed states . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is of course greatly simplified if properties of the state to be measured are known , e.g.  due to a tailored preparation of the system . as an example , consider the qubit - oscillator state @xmath105 , where @xmath106 denotes a fock state of the oscillator and @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> if the system is assumed to be in a state of this form , detection of entanglement reduces to a measurement of @xmath108 . for this state </S>",
    "<S> , it turns out that @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> a measurement of the noise at the oscillator resonance frequency for finite @xmath31 is then sufficient to detect entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> similar relations can be derived for other states . </S>",
    "<S> the less is known about the state , the more information has to be gained from @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> we found that even for _ completely arbitrary _ states , entanglement can be detected by this electronic measurement . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is our expectation that this setup is ideally suited to detect entanglement between a continuous and a discrete quantum system .    </S>",
