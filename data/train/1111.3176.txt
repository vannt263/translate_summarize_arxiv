    "complex network theory has opened the way for exploring many dynamical processes on large - scale systems consisting of individual components connected in a nontrivial topology .",
    "one of the most widely studied phenomena occurring on complex networks are spreading processes , with a prominent example attracting widespread attention being the spread of viruses in social or computer networks @xcite .",
    "there are several approaches being used in the analysis of epidemic spreading .",
    "one popular approach is the heterogeneous mean - field ( hmf ) prescription by coarse - graining nodes within degree classes and relaxing the problem by assuming that all nodes in a degree class have the same dynamical properties @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that hmf can result in different levels of accuracy @xcite .",
    "a more successful approach in determining the outcome of an infection was introduced by chakrabarti et.al  @xcite where the sis epidemic model was analyzed by using a system of probability equations , which in fact , represents a deterministic non - linear dynamical system ( nlds ) .",
    "this approach was also used in @xcite , where a family of sis epidemic models is examined , parameterized by the number of stochastic contact trials per unit time , that range from contact processes ( where the contagion expands at a certain rate from an infective vertex to one neighbor at a time ) to reactive processes ( in which an infective individual effectively contacts all its neighbors to expand the epidemics ) . using a deterministic model ,",
    "referred to as the microscopic markov - chain approach ( mmca ) , which is virtually equivalent to nlds , the whole phase diagram of the different infection models is constructed and their critical properties are determined .",
    "it is worth noting that using different number of stochastic contagion per unit time extends the usability of the model , since this number can surely vary for different real - world problems @xcite .",
    "recently , a mixed approach using both nlds and hmf was proposed in @xcite which lead to a nonperturbative formulation enhancing the predictive power of the classical hmf approach .",
    "heterogeneous environments have also been extensively studied .",
    "one such is an epidemic model with inhomogeneous infection probabilities on a graph with prescribed degree distribution @xcite where model s dynamics are derived for i.i.d .",
    "weights and for weights that are functions of the degrees . with the help of these theoretical frameworks ,",
    "the role of network topology in the spreading process has been repeatedly emphasized , yielding the result of a finite threshold for the spreading process in networks with exponentially bounded degree distributions , and a vanishing threshold in infinite uncorrelated networks with a power - law degree distribution .",
    "a recent addition to these findings is that for the sis epidemic model , the vanishing threshold has nothing to do with the scale - free nature of the degree distribution , but is the result of the largest hub being a self - sustainable source for the infection @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , the currently established connections are very rough with a topology - related threshold differentiating between two extreme outcomes of the model . with the threshold being satisfied",
    ", there is still a large spectrum for different spreading parameters and the poorly understood role of the network s topology there motivated our work . in this paper",
    "we adopt the approach proposed in @xcite and study the deterministic epidemic model on graphs , in which the dynamics of individual nodes is described by a discrete - time markov chain . in the sis model , a node can be in one of two states : susceptible ( s ) or infective ( i ) .",
    "infective nodes can infect other neighbouring nodes , and each node can be randomly cured with probability @xmath2 per unit time . at each time step , an infective node makes a number of trials per unit time to transmit the disease to its neighbours with probability @xmath3 .",
    "we consider two specific cases : ( i ) the contact process , which involves a single stochastic contagion per infective node per unit time , and ( ii ) the reactive process , which involves as many stochastic contagions per unit time as neighbours a node has .",
    "the work in this paper extends that of @xcite .",
    "we derive upper and lower bounds on the probability of a node to be infective , and determine how tight the bounds are around the probability that a node is infective . for both processes the bounds are derived using the @xmath0hop neighbourhood of each node .",
    "the larger the considered neighbourhood  the more topological information one uses to determine the bounds , hence the bounds are tighter .",
    "we use the difference between the upper and lower bound averaged over all nodes to determine the influence of the network topology on the spreading process and compute numerical results for a real - world e - mail network . for additional clarity ,",
    "figure [ fig : plotedgraphs ] depicts the @xmath4-hop and @xmath5-hop neighborhood of a particular node in the enron e - mail network with degree 10 , together with the calculated bounds for its probability of infection derived using only its respective subgraph information .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following .",
    "section [ sec:2 ] gives the definition of the model and recovers known results .",
    "the contributions of this paper are contained in sections [ sec:3 ] and [ sec:4 ] . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "the upper and lower bounds on the probability of being infective are derived for the reactive process , and numerical results for the e - mail network are presented .",
    "section [ sec:4 ] gives the bounds for the contact process , along with the corresponding numerical results .",
    "section [ sec : conc ] concludes the paper and points out future research directions .",
    "consider a closed population of @xmath6 individuals , connected in a network structure which is represented by a simple , undirected , unweighted , connected and unipartite graph @xmath7 with node set @xmath8 and edge set @xmath9 .",
    "the adjacency matrix of the graph is given by @xmath10_{n \\times n}$ ] , where @xmath11 if node @xmath12 is connected to node @xmath13 , and @xmath14 otherwise .",
    "each node can be in one of two possible states : susceptible ( s ) and infective ( i ) .",
    "susceptible nodes are healthy and can contract the disease upon contact with infective nodes , which spread the disease . after the infectious period of the disease has ended , a node becomes susceptible to the disease once again .",
    "the initial set of infective nodes at time 0 is assumed to be non - empty , and all other nodes are assumed to be in state s at time 0 .",
    "the state of a node is represented by a status vector , an indicator vector containing a single 1 in the position corresponding to the present state , and 0 in the other @xmath15^t,$ ] for all @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17^t $ ] be the probability mass function ( pmf ) of node @xmath12 at time @xmath18 .",

    "stochastic - sis ] ) @xmath23 is the probability of curing and @xmath24 is the probability of disease transmission from an infective to a susceptible node .",
    "we consider two cases of infection spreading : the contact process and the reactive process .",
    "the contact process @xcite is a dynamical process that involves a single stochastic contagion per infective node per unit time , while in the reactive process @xcite there are as many stochastic contagions per unit time as there are neighbours to a node .",
    "the distinction between the two processes is reflected in the probability @xmath25 that a susceptible node @xmath12 receives the infection from any combination of its infective neighbours .",
    "the probability @xmath25 has the form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a contact probability .",
    "without loss of generality , it is instructive to think of these probabilities as the transition probabilities of random walkers on the network .",
    "the general case is represented by @xmath28 random walkers leaving node @xmath12 at each time step : @xmath29 the contact process corresponds to a model dynamics of one contact per unit time , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , thus @xmath32 . in the reactive process",
    "all neighbors are contacted , which corresponds , in this description , to set the limit @xmath33 , @xmath31 , resulting on @xmath34 .    though exact and realistic , the system of equations ( [ eq : stochastic - sis ] ) is not suitable for the analytical study of the system dynamics , since the new statuses are obtained as a result of a decision process , transforming a continuous variable into a discrete one .",
    "that is why , in the further text , we will complement the status dependent system , with a set of adequate probability equations .",
    "this approach was introduced by chakrabarti et.al  @xcite , who analyzed the infection in the network using a system of probability equations , referred to as the non - linear dynamical system ( nlds ) model . adopting their approach to the sis process ( [ eq : stochastic - sis ] ) , we obtain the following set of difference equations for the probabilities of states s and i : @xmath35 where @xmath25 is now @xmath36 note that ( [ eq : det - sis ] ) is a deterministic equation .",
    "since @xmath37 for all @xmath12 and all @xmath18 , we rewrite ( [ eq : det - sis ] ) using @xmath38 : @xmath39 equation ( [ eq : xi - sis ] ) represents a nonlinear dynamical system @xmath40^n \\to [ 0,1]^n$ ] .",
    "the system ( [ eq : xi - sis ] ) has two fixed points : the origin @xmath41 and let @xmath42 be the fixed point of ( [ eq : xi - sis ] ) different from the origin for the graph @xmath43 .",

    "whenever the infection to cure ratio @xmath52 is greater than the network threshold @xmath53 the disease will reach an endemic state in the network . for a contact process @xmath54 ,",
    "since @xmath51 is a row stochastic matrix , while for a reactive process @xmath55 . moreover , when @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , the ergodicity of the markov chains describing the sis dynamics of each node is guaranteed and therefore ( [ eq : det - sis ] ) has a unique globally stable fixed point",

    "the obvious lower bound is @xmath75 , but replacing 0 in a recurrent relation similar to the one in ( [ eq : rec - for - u ] ) will produce only 0s .",
    "appendix [ app - reactive ] contains the theorem ( [ theorem - reactive - all-1 ] ) for lower bounds of @xmath61 : @xmath76 for all @xmath12 , which is analogous to theorem ( [ theorem - reactive - all ] ) , and the bounds @xmath77 are defined as @xmath78 where @xmath79 note that the left - hand side of ( [ eq : bound - reactive - all-2 ] ) is defined only for @xmath80 , since @xmath75 .",
    "this property comes from ( [ eq : stability - cond ] ) since the graph associated with @xmath81 is a path graph of size @xmath5 with @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath77 for all @xmath73 are also going to be defined only for @xmath74 , since the a priori assumption is that the peripheral nodes have no probability of being infected . in order to obtain bounds for @xmath83",

    "this is stated formally in lemma [ lemma - reactive - lower ] in appendix [ app - reactive ] . using this interesting property",
    ", we can derive lower bound for an arbitrary node by simply obtaining ( numerically ) the stationary solution of ( [ eq : xi - reactive ] ) for the 1-hop neighborhood starting at node @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath87 is a lower bound for @xmath86 : @xmath91 where @xmath92^{k_i}}{1 - \\left [ 1 - \\frac{\\beta^2 x_i^{*'}}{\\beta x_i^ { * ' } + \\delta } \\right]^{k_i } + \\delta}\\ ] ] is the stationary solution of ( [ eq : xi - reactive ] ) for the hub ( central node ) of a star graph @xmath88 with @xmath93 nodes , @xmath68 being the degree of node @xmath12 .",
    "note that bound ( [ eq : bound - reactive - lower ] ) unlike bound ( [ eq : bound - reactive ] ) uses 1-hop topology information ( the degree of the node ) a priori , thus avoiding the problem when @xmath83 .",
    "consequently , one can find progressively better lower bounds for node @xmath12 by solving ( [ eq : xi - reactive ] ) for different subgraphs of @xmath43 .    to show this",

    "the bound @xmath123 depends on the degree of the node @xmath12 , that is , the information contained in the 1-hop neighborhood of @xmath43 extracted by starting at node @xmath12 , while for the bound @xmath122 one computes the sis model on the subgraph @xmath107 , which is the subgraph of neighbors of @xmath12 . in a similar fashion ,",
    "the bounds @xmath124 and @xmath125 are obtained by considering second neighbors of @xmath12 ( neighbors of the first neighbors ) .",
    "the bound @xmath125 can be computed by using @xmath126 for all neighbors @xmath13 of @xmath12 .",

    "finally , for @xmath127 , since @xmath108 is the entire graph @xmath43 , @xmath128 takes into account the topology of the whole network .",
    "therefore , it makes sense to calculate the difference @xmath129 , when @xmath130 , and for small values of @xmath94 . in this way",
    ", one could , at least numerically , answer one of the basic questions in mathematical epidemiology for any graph : what is the influence of the graph topology on disease spreading , or more precisely , on the probability that given node will be infected ?    lower bounds are derived as stationary solution of the sis process for the corresponding subgraphs . on the other hand ,",
    "upper bounds are found by back - propagation using the equation ( [ eq : rec - for - u ] ) . as a consequence , when @xmath119 , @xmath131 while @xmath132 and thus @xmath133 .",

    "depicts the size of a @xmath94-hop neighborhood for the enron e - mail network , @xmath143 , as measured by the number of edges in the corresponding subgraph averaged over all nodes @xmath12 , as well as its fraction of the total number of edges in the network .",
    ".average size of @xmath94-hop neighborhood for the enron e - mail network .",
    "@xmath143 is an average of @xmath144 over all nodes @xmath12 and @xmath145 is the total number of edges in the network . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figures [ fig : reactive ] and [ fig : gap - reactive ] summarize our results . as depicted in figure [ fig : reactive ] , the bounds are surprisingly tight even when only 2-hop topology information is being used .",
    "more precisely , we obtain a very good estimate for the infection density @xmath1 by summing over node - level estimates which are using only @xmath146 of the network topology on average ( see table [ table : avgsize ] ) .",
    "the upper bound @xmath147 is also surprisingly tight given that it only uses the node s degrees while having no information for the edges in the network .",
    "figure [ fig : gap - reactive ] shows that the average difference @xmath140 between the bounds decreases as one considers 1-hop , 2-hop , and 3-hop topology information , as expected since the bounds around the stationary infection density @xmath138 become tighter .",
    "also the spreading becomes less topology dependent as the disease transmission parameter @xmath3 increases .",
    "when @xmath3 is close to @xmath148 , @xmath61 and consequently @xmath1 , are close to zero as well .",
    "therefore , as @xmath3 approaches @xmath148 , it is expected that the value of @xmath61 is influenced by the whole network . for the enron network ,",
    "as indicated in figure [ fig : gap - reactive ] , the average difference between the bounds calculated from 3-hop neighborhood is close to zero , @xmath149 for all @xmath3 .",
    "additionally , when @xmath150 , topology of only 2-hops away is relevant for the spreading process , @xmath151 .",
    "the bounds calculated using only 1-hop topology , i.e. the nodes degrees are wide apart for all values of @xmath3 for the particular network , indicating that the specific degrees are highly influential in the spreading process .    in this light ,",
    "we examine the difference @xmath142 between the bounds for three randomly chosen nodes with particular degree : one with minimum degree , one with average degree , and one with maximum degree .",
    "note that results vary greatly for the three types of nodes .",
    "the difference @xmath142 is smallest for the node with minimum degree reaching a maximum of 0.028 for all @xmath3 given only 2-hop topology information ( 0.4% of the entire network topology on average ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that the lower bound is very close to the actual result , with the difference being due to the upper bound requiring more information to converge . interestingly , while the gap for the node with maximum degree quickly decreases with the increase of @xmath3 , it can be large for specific values of @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to the minimum degree case , for the node with maximum degree , the difference is due to the lower bound not having converged , while the upper bound is quite tight .",
    "another interesting result for the node with maximum degree is that as @xmath3 gets greater than 0.04 , knowing only the neighbors of the node s neighbors suffices for predicting the outcome of the infection . for the node with average degree ,",
    "we observe two interesting results .",
    "firstly , the difference @xmath142 exists for a relatively wide span of @xmath3 ( as in the minimum degree case ) .",
    "the other result is that for some specific values of @xmath3 , @xmath142 can be relatively large ( as in the maximum degree case ) .",
    "however , the difference @xmath142 is smaller than 0.03 for all values of @xmath3 given the 3-hop topology information which constitutes approximately 12.5% of the total network topology on average .    finally , for all nodes ,",
    "the bounds on the probability of being infective are tighter as @xmath152 , and looser as @xmath153 .",
    "the conclusion from this is that as @xmath153 , network topology plays a bigger role in the dynamics of the spreading process .",
    "for the contact process , since @xmath154 , we rewrite ( [ eq : xi - stat ] ) as : @xmath155}{\\left [ 1 - \\prod_{j=1}^n ( 1 - \\beta \\frac{a_{ij}x_j^*}{\\sum_k a_{ik } } )   \\right ] + \\delta}\\ ] ]    from lemma [ lemma - contact ] and [ lemma - contact2 ] ( see appendix [ app - contact ] ) we have the following bounds for the stationary solution of ( [ eq : xi - contact ] ) @xmath156 note that the bound ( [ eq : bound - contact ] ) is independent of the specific network topology .",
    "its left - hand and right - hand side correspond to the stationary solution of ( [ eq : xi - contact ] ) for an infinitely large full - mesh graph and a path graph of size 2 respectively .",
    "similarly to the reactive process , better bounds can be obtained if we use a node s degree : @xmath157^{k_i}}{1 - \\left [ 1 - \\beta x_p \\right ] ^{k_i}+\\delta } < x_i^ * \\leq \\nonumber \\\\   & \\leq & \\frac{1 - \\left [ 1 - \\beta + \\delta \\right ] ^{k_i}}{1 - \\left [ 1 - \\beta + \\delta \\right ] ^{k_i}+\\delta } \\equiv u_i^1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the degree of node @xmath12 and @xmath158 is the solution of the equation : @xmath159 more generally , by using @xmath73-hop neighborhoods , the stationary solution of ( [ eq : xi - contact ] ) for an arbitrary node @xmath12 , @xmath61 , is bounded by , @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath162 for a formal definition and proof see theorem [ theorem - contact - all ] in appendix [ app - contact ] .",
    "note that here , unlike in the reactive process , the problem with @xmath163 when @xmath164 is avoided since @xmath165 .",
    "again , it makes sense to calculate the difference @xmath166 between the upper and lower bound derived by using n - hop topology information for node @xmath12 to determine the dependence of the contact process on the specific network topology .",
    "figures [ fig : contact ] and [ fig : gap - contact ] show the numerical results . as in the reactive process , we study the upper bound @xmath167 and lower bound @xmath168 on @xmath1 , as well as the average difference between the upper and lower bounds @xmath140",
    ". we also study @xmath142 for 3 nodes : the node with minimum degree , a node with average degree , and the node with maximum degree .",
    "note that @xmath169 when @xmath170 .    in general ,",
    "the contact process is less dependent on the network topology than the reactive process , as the largest value of @xmath171 is an order of magnitude less than the corresponding value for the reactive process .",
    "the more topology information is included in the calculation of the bounds , the difference between them decreases . also , the probabilities that each of the 3 examined nodes is infective are equally dependent on the network topology , since @xmath172 for @xmath173 are similarly valued .",
    "contrary to the reactive process , the bounds on the probability of being infective are tighter as @xmath153 ( see figure [ fig : contact ] ) . in the appendix [ app - limit ] , we show that when @xmath3 is close to @xmath174 , the probabilities of being infective have an analytical solution in closed form , they are no longer topology dependent , and are functions only of the spreading process parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "in this paper we have derived the upper and lower bounds on the probability that a node is infective for the sis model of infection spreading on networks , where the behavior of a node is modeled with a discrete - time markov chain sis model .",
    "we have considered the reactive and the contact process as two cases of the spreading process . for both processes we use the difference between upper and lower bounds on microscopic level to assess the dependence of the spreading processes on network topology .",
    "numerical results are given on the enron e - mail network .",
    "for both processes , the bounds are progressively better as one considers a larger @xmath0hop neighborhood of a node . for the reactive process , both bounds on the probability that a node is infective are tighter as @xmath152 and their difference is largest for nodes with average degree .",

    "one of the main implications of the paper is that if @xmath3 is larger than its critical value ( when @xmath3 is close to @xmath148 the probability of a node to be infective is anyway close to zero ) , one can estimate the probability of being infective using only local information ( considering only @xmath0hop local topology , for small @xmath73 ) , without knowing the whole network . consequently , from this local information one can also estimate the density of being infective on the whole network , as well as assess the extend to which the topology affects the outcome of the infection on macroscopic level .",
    "the results of this paper are easily extendable to other ergodic models ( such as sirs , for example ) and are related to all types of spreading ( idea , failure , rumor ) @xcite , regardless on the type of the spread agent . how these results can be extended to sir model by considering sirs model and taking one of its parameters to approach zero ( or one ) so that sirs model in this limit approaches sir model is a question for further research .",
