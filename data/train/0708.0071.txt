    "nuclear halo is a kind of exotic structures in which the nuclear matter distribution extends to large radii because of its weakly bound character .",
    "halo nuclei have been extensively investigated both experimentally and theoretically for decades @xcite . however , up to date most of the halo nuclei confirmed are the neutron halo .",
    "the proton halos observed are rather scarce .",
    "since @xmath6b and @xmath1ne are predicted as proton halos @xcite , the first excited state of @xmath1f@xcite and proton - rich isotopes p and s @xcite are predicted as the proton halos and some of them are probed experimentally .",
    "there is a popular opinion that it is more difficult to form proton halo because the coulomb barrier hinders the proton penetrating into the out region of nucleus .",
    "however , this may be not true actually in some cases . as will be seen below , for lighter nuclei",
    "the proton halo is easier to occur as compared to neutron halo due to the coulomb interaction .",
    "the coulomb interaction has two effects on the formation of nuclear halo .",
    "one of these effects is that it makes the energy level shift closer to the fermi level thus facilitating the penetration of the valence proton beyond the range of nuclear force . on the other hand ,",
    "the coulomb barrier of the proton hinders the formation of halo structure . in the case of lighter nuclei ,",
    "the former effect is more important than the later one .    because nuclear force is nearly charge - independent , the structure difference between mirror nuclei should mainly come form the effects of the coulomb interaction . therefore , the mirror nuclei in the neutron - rich side would act as a useful reference system to explore the role of the coulomb interaction on the exotic structure formation . for this purpose , in this work",
    "we investigate the structures of five pair of mirror nuclei @xmath7-@xmath1f , @xmath2na-@xmath2p , @xmath3mg-@xmath3p , @xmath4al-@xmath4p and @xmath5si-@xmath5p which are all in the @xmath8 state in the framework of rmf . combining with the rmf results of the 2@xmath0 states of @xmath9o-@xmath9n and @xmath10ne-@xmath10na @xcite",
    ", we find that for the seven pairs of mirror nuclei , the exotic structure of proton - rich nucleus is more obvious than that of its mirror nucleus , the difference of exotic size between the mirror nuclei becomes smaller with the increase of mass number a of the nucleus , both the ratios of the valence proton and the valence neutron root - mean - square ( rms ) radius to the matter rms radius in each pair of mirror nuclei decrease linearly with the increase of mass number a. in addition , in order to interpret the results above , we calculate in detail two opposite effects of energy level shifted and the coulomb barrier hindrance on the exotic structure formation by means of the single particle model ( spm ) and find that the contribution of the energy level shift is more important than that of coulomb barrier when a is small . however , the hindrance of coulomb barrier becomes more obvious with the increase of a. when a is larger than 39 , coulomb effects on the exotic structure formation will almost become zero because its two effects counteract with each other .",
    "as the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory is a standard method for describing properties of the spherical nuclei and some deformed nuclei and its details can been found elsewhere such as refs .",

    "we select @xmath1o- @xmath1f as an example to explain the details of the calculations . at first , we obtain the rms radii of the valence nucleon with the single - particle model ( 4.27 fm for @xmath1o and 5.43 fm for @xmath1f ) .",
    "next , we assume that the binding energy of @xmath1o is the same as @xmath1f and calculate the valence neutron rms radii for @xmath1o under this condition .",
    "the result is 10.95 fm , which is much larger than the actual value of @xmath1o .",
    "this implies that the energy level shifted makes the rms radius increase 6.68 fm if the effects of coulomb barrier switch off .",
    "however , the coulomb barrier hinders the exotic formation in reality . the rms radius of @xmath1f is less than the result obtained by neglecting the effect of the coulomb barrier .",

    "it shows that two effects of the coulomb interaction are opposite on the formation of exotic structures of valence proton , and the contributions of the energy level shifted are more important than that of the coulomb barrier .",

    ", the variations of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath50 with the mass numbers are given in fig.6 .",
    "it is seen from table ii and fig.6 that the two effects of the coulomb interaction on the valence proton dispersion are opposite , and when mass number a is smaller the contribution of the energy level shifted is more important than that of the coulomb barrier hindrance .",
    "however , the hindrance of the coulomb barrier becomes more obvious with the increase of a , and total effect of the coulomb interaction on the valence proton dispersion decreases linearly with increase of the mass number a of the nucleus , and when a is larger than about 34 , coulomb effects on the exotic structure formation will almost become zero because its two effects counteract with each other .",
    "these conclusions are in good agreement with those obtained with rmf although there are some differences in their values , which maybe come from the difference between the two theoretical models rmf and spm .",
