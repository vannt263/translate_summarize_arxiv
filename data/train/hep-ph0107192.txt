    "the exclusive process plays an important role in understanding the strong interactions .",
    "the detail analysis of exclusive processes not only can reveal the constituents of hadron but also can untangle the underlying dynamics .",
    "one important progress in this respect is the prediction of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) for exclusive process in high energy limit @xcite . in pqcd formula",
    ", the transition amplitude can be expressed as a convolution integral over initial and final state meson wave fucntions and a hard funtion .",
    "the hard function can be perturbatively calculable , while the meson wave functions can only be determined , nonperturbatively .",
    "the pion form factor has been investigated in the framework of pqcd @xcite . in the experimentally accessable energy region of few gev@xmath2 ,",
    "the asymptotic of pqcd is only about one fourth of the experimental value .",
    "this leads to two problems for pqcd .",
    "one problem relates to the self - consistency of pqcd and the other problem requires increasing the maginutde of pqcd .",
    "the former was first addressed by isgur and llywellyn smith @xcite that the most contributions come from the soft end - point regions or small values of the fraction variables , indicating the perturbative calculation inconsistent .",
    "this problem was partially resolved by li and sterman @xcite who proposed a modified pqcd formulation , in which the physics of the end - point regions are carefully dealt with and the associated contributions are suppressed by a resummation over soft radiative corrections , the sudakov factor .",
    "it was found that , with the transverse degrees of freedom playing the role of infrared cut - off , the pqcd contribution becomes self - consistent for momentum transfers as low as few gev .",
    "however , note that the magnitude of modified pqcd is still smaller than the experimental value by a factor of @xmath7 .",
    "the general wisdom to increase the magnitude of pqcd is by invoking the power correction .",
    "is @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "] however , the conclusion of past results was rather pessimistic . even including twist-3 power corrections , it is still difficult to accomodate the data .",
    "more worsely , introducing the twist-3 contribtion imposes another problem that the twist-3 contributions may exceed the leading twist contribution at intermediate energy region of @xmath6 being @xmath9 gev@xmath2@xcite or @xmath10 gev@xmath2 ( for the parton carrying transverse momenta ) @xcite .",
    "this is because there involves a huge factor @xmath11 for the twist-3 contribution , where @xmath12 is the pion mass and @xmath13 is the average constituent quark masss of the pion .",
    "the strange behavior of the twist-3 contribution violates the principle of perturbation theory : the magnitude of subleading terms should be smaller than that of the leading ones .",
    "the reason why the twist-3 contribution is inconsistent with perturbation theory may reside in the method of calculation . in the previous approaches @xcite ,",
    "the spin projections @xmath14 and @xmath15 are employed and the normalizations of related distribution amplitudes ( das ) are determined with the help of chiral perturbation theory . however , these methods gave no garantees on factorization of hard and soft radiative corrections for a twist-3 contribution .",
    "the failure of these methods in explaining the data may indicate the incorrectness of factorization .    in a recent power expansion method developed by us @xcite , it showes that the calculation of high twist contribution is compatible with qcd factorization .",
    "there requires more perturbative contributions than spin projections .",
    "the most important feature of this method is that the partonic interpretation for high twist contribtion is retained . for the pion form factor ,",
    "the nlo power corrections calculated by this method have reverse signs and inverse magitudes against to those results of the previous mentioned methods .",
    "these differences give us a opportunity to explain the data by only employing pqcd .",
    "it is noted that the nlo contribution derived in this text is smaller than the leading order contribution over whole energy range of the experiment .",

    "v is devoted to conclusions .",
    "in this section , we will describe our approach of power expansion for @xmath16 .",
    "the method we employ is called the collinear expansion @xcite . in the following , we first sketch the procedures of how to perfom the collinear expansion for @xmath16",
    ". then , we will show the collinear expansion is compatible with the qcd factorization , which is important for giving a reliable perturbative calculation in qcd .",

    "<S> in many years ago , isgur and llewellyn smith addressed that pqcd is inapplicable to exclusive processes @xcite , such as the pion form factor . </S>",
    "<S> the main problem is that the asymptotic of pqcd is only about one fourth of the experimental value @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we reexamine this pqcd deep problem . by including nlo power corrections to the pion form factor </S>",
    "<S> , we may arrive at a perturbative explanation for the data . </S>",
    "<S> the key realization is that we need to interprete that the strong interaction coupling constant involved in the pqcd result should be taken as an effective coupling constant under nonperturbative qcd vaccum . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that one can equally identify the relevant scale for the effective coupling constant as the factorization scale about 1 gev . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the average momentum fraction variable locates about 0.5 , which is in favor of the asymptotic pion wave function . by employing photon - pion form factor with nlo power corrections to factorize out the nonperturbative effects involved in the effective coupling constant </S>",
    "<S> , we can extract an effective running coupling constant , which represents an effective coupling involving in the hard scattering subprocesses . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the effective running coupling constant and the usual perturbative running coupling constant ( @xmath0 gev ) is very small for @xmath1 gev@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the effective running coupling constant @xmath3 is smaller than @xmath4 for @xmath5 gev@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this directly showes that pqcd is applicable to exclusive processes at energy @xmath1 gev@xmath2 . in summary , with nlo power corrections , pqcd can completely explain the @xmath6 spectrum of pion form factor .    </S>",
