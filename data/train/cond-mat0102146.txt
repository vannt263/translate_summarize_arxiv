    "measuring friction at an atomic level has recently become experimentally possible@xcite .",
    "many studies of the dynamics of appropriate non - linear systems aiming at establishing the mechanisms giving rise to energy dissipation during the sliding of a body onto a crystalline surface have appeared in the literature@xcite .",
    "the frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model , which describes a harmonic chain interacting with a rigid periodic substrate , is particularly suitable to study the important case of an incommensurate ( ic ) lattice parameter ratio of the contacting surfaces .",
    "the present study focuses on the effects of discommensuration on the dynamics .",
    "it should be kept in mind that a more realistic study of friction would require an extension to two dimensions .",
    "coupling to the third dimension can be provided either by an ad hoc damping term or by coupling to an elastic medium@xcite .",
    "the ground state properties of this model have been thoroughly studied@xcite . at a critical value @xmath0 of the coupling to the external potential",
    ", the ground state of the system displays a structural transition ( aubry transition ) from a floating to a pinned configuration . below this threshold",
    ", the center of mass of the static system can be displaced on the substrate without energy costs .",
    "therefore , one might expect a frictionless regime also in a dynamic situation and a _ superlubric _ regime , where the chain would slide indefinitely , has been predicted for this case@xcite . in a previous paper@xcite",
    "we have pointed out that the inherent non - linear coupling of the center of mass ( cm ) motion to the phonons leads instead to an irreversible decay of the cm velocity .",
    "the essential mechanism for the transfer of kinetic energy from the center of mass to the internal vibrations is the parametric resonant excitation of phonons mediated by ordinary resonances with phonons related to the modulating potential .",
    "here we show that this type of mechanism has another important consequence , namely it causes the appearance of umklapp terms , signalling a dynamical transition in the system from a floating to a pinned state .",
    "we have studied this phenomenon by identifying a new quantity , which we call generalized angular momentum ( gam ) , which is an integral of motion only if the system is in a floating ic phase , reflecting the invariance of the lagrangian of the model for a phase shift in this state .",
    "we show that this invariance is equivalent to the absence of umklapp terms . by means of numerical simulations",
    "we show that the temporal behavior of the gam is a powerful probe both of the ( in)commensurability of the groundstate configuration and of the dynamical phase in which the system is during motion .",
    "simulations where the incommensurate ground state is given an initial velocity show that the gam remains conserved up to a well defined time where a sudden jump takes place .",
    "we have been able to relate this change of behavior from conserved to non conserved to the appearance of umklapp terms .",
    "an important finding is that this floating - pinned transition does not coincide with the onset of friction .",
    "it was recently suggested by popov@xcite that the appearance of umklapp terms , i.e. the conservation of quasi - momentum instead of momentum for crystalline systems , is the mechanism via which friction occurs in incommensurate contacts .",
    "the present result shows that this is not the only mechanism . by monitoring the system via the gam",
    "we can show that decay of the cm velocity may occur already in the floating phase .",
    "the onset of friction and the appearance of umklapp terms are both caused by non - linear couplings and resonant phonon excitations in the system but remain two distinct phenomena occurring at different times .    in sec .",
    "[ res ] we describe the construction of the gam by deriving it from the lagrangian for the system in fourier space and define conditions under which it is conserved . in sec .",
    "[ num ] we present results of numerical simulations which confirm the validity of our analytical derivation and underline the usefulness of the gam to discriminate between commensurate and floating ic and pinned ic phases , respectively .",
    "subsequently , we examine in sec .",
    "[ umkl ] the relationship between pinning and umklapp and show the presence of a well - defined transition time . in sec .",
    "[ concl ] we present conclusions and perspectives of this work . in the appendix",
    "we provide the reader with an explicit proof that the gam is an integral of motion in absence of umklapp .",
    "in this section we will construct a generalized angular momentum for the dynamical fk model , as described in ref . .",
    "we remind the reader that this model represents a chain of @xmath1 particles which interact with each other via a first - neighbor harmonic potential and are subjected to an external , spatially periodic , potential of strength @xmath2 .",
    "the fk hamiltonian reads : @xmath3 \\label{ham}\\ ] ] where the @xmath4 are the particle positions and @xmath5 their momenta . the ratio between the modulation period of the external potential @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( the equilibrium distance between the atoms of the chain for @xmath8 ) is taken to be irrational , i.e. the system is incommensurate . in our calculations",
    "we take @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( golden mean ) . in the numerical implementation for a finite system of @xmath1 particles we impose periodic boundary conditions",
    "@xmath11    this implies that we have to choose commensurate approximants for the equilibrium distance @xmath7 . by expressing @xmath7 as ratio of consecutive fibonacci numbers we obtain approximants which satisfy the condition @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath1 integers .",
    "let us introduce the modulation wavevector @xmath14 and the position and momentum of the cm of the chain of atoms : @xmath15 the equations of motion for the deviations @xmath16 from the equilibrium positions in the uncoupled chain are then given by : @xmath17 as noted in ref .",
    ", in the weak coupling regime it is useful to move to fourier coordinates @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "the phonon dispersion of the chain for @xmath8 is denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "the lagrangian associated with eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) in transformed space becomes : @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 it is important to notice that since wave vectors are defined modulo @xmath24 , the kronecker deltas in eq .",
    "( [ lagrk ] ) should be read as : @xmath25 umklapp is present whenever this relation is satisfied with @xmath26 .",
    "it is clear that the occurrence of umklapp depends on the modes @xmath27 which are not negligible , and on the choice of the ( extended or reduced ) brillouin zone in which @xmath28 is represented .",
    "it is known that in the groundstate , for a coupling @xmath2 well below the critical value @xmath0 , which for this model assumes the value @xmath29 , the modes with wavevector @xmath30 have an amplitude which scales as @xmath31 .",
    "this number @xmath32 is therefore a natural label to represent the modes ; we define @xmath33 as the smallest ( in absolute value ) number which satisfies : @xmath34 for a finite system with @xmath1 particles , where @xmath28 can be represented in the reduced brillouin zone as @xmath35 , @xmath36 $ ] , this can be rewritten as : @xmath37 \\label{k_k}\\ ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we compare the phonon amplitudes for the ground state of the fk model for @xmath38 , @xmath39 , plotted as a function of the usual wavevector label @xmath40 ( panel ( a ) ) , as well as reordered according to the label @xmath41 ( panel ( b ) ) . note that , due to finite numerical precision , the scaling behavior is hidden in numerical noise after the first fifteen modes .",
    "the use of @xmath41 as a mode label makes apparent the fact that there is no umklapp in the ground state of the fk model in the modulated phase for @xmath42 .",
    "in fact umklapp would imply the presence of a non vanishing term : @xmath43 the joint amplitude of this term would be : @xmath44 which vanishes for @xmath45 .    the absence of umklapp terms is directly related to the existence of a free floating phase , which is a well known invariance property of the fk model . in the present notation it amounts to the invariance of the lagrangian for the transformation : @xmath46 this invariance is related to the existence of a zero - frequency goldstone mode in the system .",
    "this mode is also often called phason , and should not be confused with the usual acoustic mode of periodic crystals .",
    "having found an invariance for the lagrangian , we can look for the conjugate conserved momentum .",
    "we get : @xmath47 the quantity @xmath48 represents a generalized angular momentum ( gam ) .",
    "it is important to realize that the invariance of the lagrangian only holds in a subspace of the full phase space where umklapp terms can be neglected as it is the case for the floating ( incommensurate ) ground state . in order to stress this point , a direct calculation of @xmath49 is given in the appendix , showing that the gam @xmath48 is an integral of motion only if umklapp is not present .",
    "this quantity is therefore an useful tool to discriminate between commensurate and incommensurate structures , and floating and locked states . in the next section we present numerical simulations that we carried out for various values of the parameters of the model , showing how @xmath48 is a good indicator of the phase in which the system under examination is .",
    "we have performed numerical simulation in order to study the behavior of the gam , as defined by eq .",
    "( [ gam ] ) , integrating by a runge - kutta algorithm the @xmath1 eqs .",
    "( [ eom1 ] ) .",
    "we assign to the particles of the chain as initial conditions momenta @xmath50 and positions @xmath51 corresponding to the ground state .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows simulation results for the same number of particles @xmath1 and potential strength @xmath2 , but for a low ( @xmath52 ) and a high ( @xmath53 ) approximant to the golden mean @xmath54 , producing a commensurate structure and an approximate incommensurate one .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the momentum of the center of mass @xmath55 is similar , whereas the behavior of @xmath48 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is remarkably different being conserved only for the case which approximates an incommensurate system .",
    "this confirms that @xmath48 can be used as a tool to discriminate unambiguously between commensurate and incommensurate structures .",
    "furthermore , our numerical simulations show a remarkable fact .",
    "if we start the simulation with an incommensurate initial condition , @xmath48 is indeed conserved , but only up to a critical time @xmath56 , after which it rapidly deviates from its initial conserved value .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where we can examine the behavior of @xmath48 and @xmath55 in a weak coupling , highly incommensurate ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) case .",
    "in order to check that the observed variation of @xmath48 only sets in after a critical time @xmath56 , we have analyzed the behavior of the quantity @xmath59 , @xmath60 being the value of @xmath48 at @xmath61 .",
    "it is evident from panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that we can identify such a critical time @xmath56 where the gam has a jump in value of various order of magnitude .",
    "besides , this figure shows that , for @xmath62 , @xmath48 is conserved within our numerical accuracy , never exceeding variation larger than @xmath63 .",
    "the critical time @xmath56 obviously depends on the coupling strength @xmath42 and on the initial velocity @xmath64 .",
    "we are currently investigating the dependence @xmath65 , which turns out to be rather intricate , and plan to report on it in the near future . here , we want to concentrate on the mechanism that causes the breakdown of the conservation law , leading to a well - defined @xmath56 .",
    "we show in the next section that the answer lies in the appearance of umklapp terms , which render the system pinned , thus leading to a non conservation of @xmath48 .      as we have pointed out in sec .",
    "[ res ] , @xmath48 is conserved only in the absence of umklapp , that is to say when terms of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ umk_term ] ) have a vanishing amplitude for @xmath45 .",
    "as we have seen , this is the case for the groundstate of the incommensurate system .",
    "however , starting from the ground state , this may change during the dynamics due to parametric resonances .",
    "the movement of the cm with velocity @xmath55 induces a modulation with frequency @xmath66 in the equations of motion of the system .",
    "linear stability analysis@xcite shows that a mode @xmath28 grows exponentially ( with rise time @xmath54 ) whenever its frequency satisfies : @xmath67 for some @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath68 symbol indicates an instability window of relative width @xmath69 that scales with @xmath70 .",
    "suppose now that a mode @xmath27 is unstable .",
    "let @xmath33 be its label according to eq .",
    "( [ new_k ] ) .",
    "when @xmath71 , this mode could lead to umklapp as soon as its amplitude becomes finite .",
    "however , since its initial value is of order @xmath31 , it requires an infinite amount of time ( as @xmath45 ) to render @xmath72 finite .",
    "so we have to look for modes @xmath28 in the instability windows with @xmath33 finite .",
    "since the mapping @xmath73 leads to a uniform distribution , one indeed expects to find such a @xmath28 with @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the relative width of the joint instabilities windows .",
    "once the amplitude of the mode @xmath28 starts growing ( with a behavior given by an exponential law of the form : @xmath76 , with @xmath77 bounded from below via the upper bound on @xmath41 ) , also modes @xmath78 with @xmath79 start to develop via non linear terms in the equations of motion ( see ref . for details ) , with the form : @xmath80 umklapp can result when repeating this process @xmath81 times ( i.e. , when @xmath82 ) still gives a finite result . from eq .",
    "( [ cascade ] ) it is clear that this will happen when @xmath83 exceeds some threshold value , which is the case for @xmath84 larger than the critical time @xmath56 introduced in sec .",
    "[ num ] .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows this mechanism at work : here we have taken @xmath85 , so that @xmath86 , and @xmath38 @xmath87 . for this value of @xmath88 eq .",
    "( [ res_rule ] ) has approximate solutions for @xmath89 for @xmath35 , with @xmath90 .",
    "the corresponding values for @xmath33 are in the case @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "panel ( a ) shows that the phonon amplitudes at @xmath61 decay indeed exponentially with @xmath41 .",
    "panel ( b ) shows that the unstable mode @xmath93 with the lowest value of @xmath41 starts to grow at @xmath94 .",
    "modes at @xmath95 are also present , due to non linear terms , but quadratically smaller , as explained above . at @xmath96 modes at @xmath97",
    "become visible , as shown in panel ( c ) .",
    "there is still no umklapp , as can be seen from the absence of an amplitude at the zone boundary .",
    "such a term , corresponding to @xmath98 , finally appears in panel ( d ) , at @xmath99 .",
    "indeed , this is also precisely the time at which @xmath100 becomes order unity and @xmath48 stops being conserved ( see panel ( e ) ) .",
    "the mechanism described above shows that the appearance of umklapp terms causes a sudden transition from a floating to a pinned structure . in this respect",
    ", this transition represents a dynamical analogue of the aubry transition taking place in the static model at @xmath0 .",
    "the important difference is that , for the dynamical case , this transition occurs as a function of time at all values @xmath42 .    before concluding this section it is important to discuss the relation between this `` dynamical aubry '' transition described above and the onset of friction .",
    "the onset of friction is driven by the coupling of the cm to the mode with the modulation wavevector @xmath101 or its harmonics and consists in a special kind of parametric resonances involving more than one phonon and where the time dependent driving terms are themselves in resonance@xcite .",
    "the appearance of umklapp requires instead a phonon with finite amplitude and very special ( zone boundary ) wavevector .",
    "we could say that the last process is more difficult to achieve . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , it can be seen that the gam stays conserved , even after the cm momentum has begun its decay .",
    "this means that there is an interval of time in which the first mechanism is active whereas the second has not yet taken place .",
    "we can identify two times : one which characterizes the onset of friction and one which describes the pinning of the system . in this respect",
    "the dynamical model is much richer than the statical one . at the aubry transition ,",
    "the appearance of a static friction occurs by definition at the same value of @xmath2 at which the system gets pinned .",
    "we have shown , in the framework of the undamped 1d dynamical fk model , that it is possible to obtain analytical results concerning the existence of a new integral of motion which represents a generalized angular momentum related to a phase invariance in incommensurate systems , and we have confirmed this finding by means of numerical simulations .",
    "we have also shown that , during the dynamics , a breakdown of the conservation of the gam occurs at a well - defined time , signalling a dynamical transition from a floating phase to a locked one .",
    "we have been able to prove that this transition is related to the apperance of umklapp processes , caused by non linear couplings of the system .",
    "we are currently trying to further characterize the nature ( order ) of the transition of the dynamical model .",
    "we have furthermore shown that the onset of friction and the pinning of the system are related but distinct phenomena occurring in general at different times , which we have been able to identify .",
    "we would like to thank ted janssen for interesting discussions and suggestions .",
    "we are going to provide in this appendix an explicit derivation that @xmath102 .",
    "let us consider the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ gam ] ) : @xmath103 in order to simplify the notation , we will adopt from now on the following convention : @xmath104 .",
    "take the derivative of eq .",
    "( [ gal ] ) : @xmath105 we can immediately see that for symmetry reasons the second term cancels .",
    "let us now take the equation for @xmath106 as follows from the euler - lagrange equations : @xmath107 @xmath108 \\label{expans1}\\ ] ] and the equation for the cm motion : @xmath109 @xmath110 \\label{expansq}\\ ] ] let us insert eq .",

    "( [ expans1 ] ) cancels for the same symmetry reasons given above ) .",
    "we have for simplicity explicitly written down only the first part of the expression in square brackets , since we treat the second part exactly in the same way . rearranging the delta function and applying the following symmetry transformation : @xmath112 eq .",
