    "fluctuation relations ( frs ) have recently emerged as a new powerful set of concepts in statistical physics .",
    "@xcite they relate the stochastic fluctuations of systems far from equilibrium to their dissipative properties , thereby generalizing the well - known fluctuation - dissipation theorem,@xcite and provide ways to quantify the degree of irreversibility of nonequilibrium processes . the possibility to formulate exact statements ( sometimes referred to as `` fluctuation theorems '' ) about generic nonequilibrium systems ",
    "both classical@xcite and quantum@xcite  has ignited a burgeoning research activity . on the experimental side ,",
    "first tests have already appeared , e.g. , for soft matter@xcite or mesoscopic systems.@xcite    the concept of frs is frequently applied to the statistics of variables of thermodynamic significance , e.g. , work , heat , or entropy .",
    "this is exemplified by the crooks relation@xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the probability that an amount of work @xmath2 is done on a system in a given driving protocol , i.e. , when an external time - dependent force @xmath3 is applied to the system during a time interval @xmath4 $ ] . according to the crooks relation ,",
    "the ratio to the probability @xmath5 of negative work done during the `` backward '' protocol , i.e. , when the time - inverted force @xmath6 acts on the system , is given by a boltzmann - type factor , where @xmath7 is the inverse temperature ( @xmath8 throughout ) associated with the initial equilibrium state , and @xmath9 is the thermodynamic free energy difference between final and initial state .",
    "relations of this type may be applied to gain access to thermodynamic data ( e.g. , @xmath9 ) from fluctuation statistics . from eq .",
    "( [ crooks ] ) one obtains the celebrated jarzynski equality,@xcite @xmath10 where the average is over all process realizations under the force protocol @xmath3 . on average @xmath11 , which means that the `` sum rule '' controls the cumulative weight of rare events .",
    "relations of this type provide rigorous bounds on the behavior of thermodynamic observables .",
    "fluctuations around these bounds have been analyzed recently.@xcite    the application of external forces in many - particle systems generally leads to transport , with current flow and re - adjustment of particle concentrations . for time - dependent driving forces , frs for the ensuing current profiles",
    "carry particularly rich information . here",
    ", the notion of `` transport '' is to be interpreted in a very general sense : it may refer to the changing number of individuals in a biological quasi - species model , to the electric current flow in a mesoscopic conductor , to the number of agents in a chemical reaction , etc .",
    "unlike with frs for `` global '' ( i.e. , integrated over time ) variables , the time - resolved information on transient current flow is stored in a time - dependent function @xmath12 , and one needs to study _ functional _ probability distributions @xmath13 $ ] , rather than functions like @xmath1 . to be specific , transport through a `` system '' exchanging particles with @xmath14 `` reservoirs '' is described by currents @xmath15 flowing out of the system , and @xmath13\\equiv p[i_1,\\dots , i_m]$ ] .",
    "importantly , due to the discreteness of particle exchange with the reservoirs , the current flow enhances the noise level of the system . far off thermal equilibrium",
    ", this `` shot noise '' often becomes the dominant source of fluctuations , and the self - consistent description of the feedback cycle of currents generating noise and noise affecting the current flow becomes an important issue .    given the present interest in time - dependent mesoscopic transport phenomena , see for instance refs .  ,",
    "or in the work statistics under a quantum quench,@xcite it is important to extend the general constraints imposed by transient frs to the quantum setting .",
    "the above argument , however , needs to be applied with care in the quantum case .",
    "in fact , the existing literature on frs appears to be essentially divided into a classical and a quantum part .",
    "this concerns both the systems under consideration as well as methodological aspects .",
    "specifically , quantum theories of frs@xcite mostly rely on quantum measurement processes performed at the beginning and at the end of the protocol .",
    "this prescription is not directly suitable to transient situations , where a continuous readout of , say , currents is required .",
    "the lack of commutativity of current operators at different times then becomes an issue , and the construction of a general quantum theory of transient frs may seem a difficult task .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , the derivation of a fr for _ quantum _ current flow goes through in unaltered form as long as the external driving forces vary on time scales corresponding to classical frequencies .",
    "we will discuss this point in some detail below ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "the situation becomes particularly transparent in the many cases where the quantum system of interest actually operates close to the _ semiclassical _ limit : involving the dynamics of many particles , the action scales relevant to transport are usually much bigger than @xmath16 . in this case , the quantum keldysh functional  @xcite stays close to its classical limit , the stochastic path integral ,  @xcite and the formal lack of commutativity of current operators ceases to be an issue .",
    "in an important early work,@xcite bochkov and kuzovlev ( bk ) have formulated a general classical fr for current flow .",
    "bk relied on a symmetry analysis of the markovian operators generating the dynamics of the system ( see also the discussion in ref .  ) .",
    "in contrast , our derivations below are based on a path integral representation , which permits to explore the nonequilibrium fluctuation statistics of observables beyond the rigorous bounds imposed by frs .",
    "also , it stands to reason that the bk functional relation is too general to be useful in applications .",
    "however , the general result can be used to obtain more manageable _ derived fluctuation relations_. for example , rather than probing the full profile @xmath12 , one may consider the total charge transmitted into the @xmath17th reservoir , @xmath18 .",
    "this is arguably one of the most important global variables characterizing a transport process . under _ stationary _ transport conditions , the forward and backward protocols",
    "coincide , @xmath19 , and a crooks fr for charge has been stated in the context of mesoscopic transport,@xcite @xmath20 this relation imposes nontrivial conditions on the generating function for the full counting statistics ( fcs ) of charge transport.@xcite in particular , it implies that current cumulants of different order must be linked together.@xcite equation ( [ crookscharge ] ) has also been probed experimentally@xcite in mesoscopic circuits using a quantum point contact charge detector.@xcite while the case of unidirectional single - electron counting is directly accessible to experiments , recent progress has also been reported for bidirectional counting.@xcite all these results apply to stationary regimes .",
    "below we will show that in the experimentally relevant case of _ _ time dependent__forces @xmath3 drastic things happen : the charge fr ( [ crookscharge ] ) actually breaks down , but a more general fr for the joint probability @xmath21 can still be formulated , see eq .",
    "( [ gencrooks ] ) below .",
    "this `` generalized crooks relation '' also ensures the validity of eq .   for the statistics of work alone .",

    "the generalization of the formalism below to several types of particles , or to multiple - step master equations is straightforward .",
