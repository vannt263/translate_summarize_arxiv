    "the frictional force experienced by a quantized flux line moving in a conventional superconductor arises primarily from induced vortex electric fields coupling to charge excitations _ within _ the vortex core .",
    "this was first captured by bardeen and stephen,@xcite who treated the vortex core as a cylinder of normal metal embedded in a superconducting background .",
    "their theory is applicable to conventional superconductors for two reasons : the vortex cores are large and support a nearly continuous spectrum of single - particle states ; and @xmath10-wave pairing symmetry results in a low density of extended states surrounding the vortex cores . in cuprate superconductors the opposite situation holds : small vortex cores contain at most a few discrete states,@xcite with a continuum of low lying states _",
    "outside _ the vortex cores due to the nodes in the @xmath7-wave energy gap.@xcite bardeen  stephen theory is therefore unlikely to apply in its original form , but how it should be extended to the cuprates is not at all obvious .",
    "the dissipation associated with a moving flux line is parameterized by a vortex viscosity , @xmath11 , giving the linear coefficient of friction per unit length of flux line .",
    "vortex viscosity , like flux - flow resistivity , is usually thought of as a static property of a type - ii superconductor . however , @xmath11 should more generally be regarded as a frequency - dependent response function,@xcite in a manner similar to the extension of electrical conductivity to high frequencies .",
    "we will show that @xmath11 has a very strong frequency dependence in ortho - ii yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 , and that this frequency dependence carries the fingerprints of the microscopic processes responsible for the vortex dissipation , namely the charge dynamics of @xmath7-wave quasiparticles in the superconducting state outside the vortex cores .    as well as",
    "being interesting in its own right,@xcite vortex viscosity has additional significance in the cuprates : low superfluid density @xcite makes these materials prone to phase disordering by vortex ",
    "antivortex fluctuations,@xcite with vortex viscosity an important parameter in theoretical models of these effects.@xcite there is also the possibility that the viscous response contains dynamical signatures that could identify whether vortex fluctuations are occurring in the pseudogap regime ; this would provide information complementary to other experiments that may be probing local pairing and phase - disordered superconductivity.@xcite    in this paper we report a comprehensive study of the vortex dynamics of high purity , ortho - ii - ordered yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "remarkably , the observed @xmath5 mimics the behaviour of the zero - field microwave conductivity , @xmath6 , in which it has been established that the dominant contribution comes from the charge dynamics of nodal @xmath7-wave quasiparticles.@xcite our data therefore suggest that bulk @xmath7-wave quasiparticles _ outside _ the vortex cores are the primary source of frictional force on vortices in this material , in marked contrast to the situation in conventional @xmath10-wave materials .",
    "one consequence is that @xmath12 , like @xmath13 , has a characteristic peak at intermediate temperatures , due to a competition between quasiparticle lifetime and quasiparticle density .",
    "this leads to low temperature upturns in the flux - flow resistivity , @xmath14 , which , on closer inspection , are seen to follow a @xmath15 form , similar to the resistivity observed in the pseudogap regime of the underdoped cuprates.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with the standard dynamical model of a flux line , and discuss the observability of the vortex hall effect in microwave measurements .",
    "vortex pinning is then introduced into the dynamical model , through a redefinition of the vortex viscosity .",
    "next , we consider a more general situation , in which the vortex viscosity itself is frequency dependent , and show that this leads to a dynamical contribution to the effective pinning constant .",
    "we then present detailed measurements of the surface impedance of a high quality single crystal of ortho - ii yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 as a function of field , temperature and frequency . from these data",
    "we obtain the vortex viscosity , pinning constant , depinning frequency and flux - flow resistivity . as well as supplying new insights into the origin of the various forces experienced by the vortices , the experiments provide a stringent test of the use of single - vortex dynamical models in the interpretation of high frequency measurements .",
    "the vortex hall effect has useful parallels with that of a normal metal , so we begin by considering the magnetoconductivity of a metal in which the carriers have density @xmath16 , mass @xmath17 and charge @xmath18 . if scattering is treated in the relaxation - time approximation , the steady - state force equation is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the carrier drift velocity and @xmath21 the relaxation time .",
    "we let the magnetic field @xmath22 .",
    "the resistivity tensor that relates electric field , @xmath23 , to the current density , @xmath24 , is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the cyclotron frequency and the resistivity . the hall angle , @xmath27 , measures the deflection of the charge currents by the magnetic field : @xmath28 .",

    "the power dissipation per unit volume is @xmath36 independent of @xmath33 . on the other hand ,",
    "if a constant electric field @xmath23 is applied transverse to @xmath37 , the power dissipation per unit volume is @xmath38 which _ is _ a function of @xmath33 . whether a longitudinal transport experiment is sensitive to the hall effect therefore depends crucially on whether constant current or constant electric field is applied .",
    "the starting point for much work on vortex dynamics is the vortex equation of motion@xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the superconducting flux quantum , @xmath35 the applied transport current density , @xmath41 the vortex velocity , @xmath11 the vortex viscosity , @xmath42 the hall coefficient , and we assume that magnetic field is applied along the direction @xmath43 .",

    "we solve for the vortex velocity @xmath52 and use the josephson relation for moving vortices,@xcite @xmath53 to obtain the average electric field : @xmath54 ( here it is understood that the cross product of @xmath43 with a 2d transverse vector is a @xmath55 rotation in the transverse plane . )",
    "the vortex resistivity is then @xmath56 under conditions of constant current density @xmath35 , the power dissipation per unit volume is @xmath57 equivalent to that for an effective vortex viscosity .",

    "[ eq : viscosity ] and [ eq : hallcoefficient ] , we obtain a cancellation : @xmath58 that is , the relevant viscosity is the _ bare viscosity _ , independent of the vortex hall angle . as pointed out by golosovsky _",
    "et al._,@xcite both the direction of the vortex motion and the magnitude of the viscosity are changed but , if the system is driven by an external source of constant current , the effects cancel and the effective viscosity is the same as if @xmath59 .",
    "the situation we have in the microwave experiments is indeed one of constant @xmath35 : the superconducting sample has a surface impedance in the m@xmath60 range , tiny compared to the characteristic impedance of free space .",
    "the sample is placed into the microwave resonator at a magnetic field antinode ( electric field node ) , and the microwave @xmath61 field imposes a constant surface current density .      in any real superconductor , local material imperfections",
    "lead to pinning , preventing the free flow of flux lines.@xcite pinning effects can be particularly strong in the cuprate superconductors , especially at low temperatures , making flux - flow resistivity difficult to measure .",
    "one approach is to use a dc current in excess of the critical current to push the vortices into a state of free flux - flow.@xcite however , this is a nonlinear method and must be applied and interpreted carefully",
    ". an alternative approach , which has been used extensively,@xcite is to probe the _",
    "reversible _ vortex motion  the _ linear _ response of the vortices to a high frequency driving force .",
    "an ac current shakes the flux lines harmonically about their equilibrium positions and , when the measurements are carried out in a manner that is sensitive to both magnitude and phase , allows dissipative and reactive forces to be resolved separately .",
    "the technique permits a clean determination of the viscous and elastic parameters and , since these make contributions of comparable magnitude in the ghz range , is ideally carried out at microwave frequencies .",
    "the usual way to include pinning and elastic forces in the vortex equation of motion is through a pinning force of the form @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the effective pinning constant,@xcite and @xmath64 is the displacement of the vortex from equilibrium .",
    "this harmonic approximation should work well in the linear - response regime , in which the displacement of the vortex is small compared to the inter - vortex spacing ( typically 1    vs.  100    in our experiments ) .",
    "however , a concern now arises over whether we can continue to describe the dynamics of the system in terms of a single , _",
    "average _ vortex : in contrast to viscous and electromagnetic forces , which originate from interactions with the electron fluid on a microscopic scale , the elastic forces on a vortex arise from random material imperfections , potentially giving rise to a broad distribution of pinning constants .",
    "statistical averages over such a distribution do not necessarily correspond to the behaviour of an _ average _ vortex .",
    "nevertheless , there are several situations in which the distribution of local pinning constants should be narrowly defined , and therefore the single - vortex approach valid . at high fields , in the collective - pinning regime ,",
    "the density of flux lines is much greater than the density of pinning sites : vortices interact predominantly with one another , and only indirectly with the pinning sites , smoothing out point - to - point variations in local pinning constant .",
    "in addition to this , there are two other favourable situations , specific to high frequency experiments .",
    "first , as we will show below , the vortex viscosity can have a substantial imaginary component , which acts as an additional contribution to the effective pinning constant and can even dominate over the elastic component in the microwave frequency range .",
    "this dynamical contribution to pinning arises from interactions with the electron fluid and can be assumed to be the same everywhere in the sample .",
    "secondly , in a high frequency experiment , the only vortices visible to the microwaves are close to the sample surface .",
    "( microwave cavity perturbation is a power - absorption technique , so the relevant length scale is _ half _ the rf penetration depth . ) in clean materials , the interaction with the sample surface can become the dominant elastic force for these near - surface vortices.@xcite this type of pinning is predominantly electromagnetic , arising from the interaction of the vortex with its image vortex . in our geometry this provides an intrinsic pinning mechanism that acts along the _ entire length _ of the flux lines , rather than at particular points .",
    "we therefore proceed with the single - vortex approach , focussing on a one - dimensional model of vortex motion that includes viscous , pinning and lorentz forces , but ignores the vortex hall effect , for reasons discussed in the previous section . in the simplest version of this model we have @xmath65 here the vortex velocity , @xmath66 ,",

    "in which the transport current density is @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the phasor vortex velocity .",
    "we see that the inclusion of pinning can be incorporated into a redefined , _ complex _ viscosity , @xmath70 .",
    "in addition to the pinning term , there is the possibility that the bare viscosity itself has frequency dependence  something that indeed occurs in ortho - ii yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath71 and , because we are dealing with a physical response function , the bare viscosity must have real and imaginary parts , @xmath72 .",

    "are strongly frequency dependent , and a substantial part of the reactive force experienced by the vortex is due to dynamical effects arising from the viscosity , rather than elasticity due to pinning .",
    "the idea of a depinning frequency is therefore not well defined .",

    "however , @xmath185 increases to be 10 to 25  ghz ( depending on field ) due to the exponential increase in @xmath186 on cooling . in this regime",
    "it is essential that vortex dynamics be probed with a technique that accurately measures both real and imaginary parts of the surface impedance .",
    "one of our initial motivations for carrying out multiple - frequency microwave measurements on ortho - ii yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 was as a test of the validity of the single - vortex dynamical model outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : vortex_dynamics ] .",
    "single - vortex theories are often treated with skepticism : there is a suspicion that they appear to work only because they have as many adjustable parameters ( @xmath63 and @xmath11 ) as there are degrees of freedom in the data ( real and imaginary parts of @xmath187 . multiple - frequency data therefore offer the prospect of a stringent test .",
    "a complication arises if the parameters in the vortex model have intrinsic frequency dependence , as appears to be the case in ortho - ii yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 . testing the vortex model then becomes a more subtle process : as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : complex_viscosity_model ] , causality means that the dissipative and reactive parts of the dynamical response must obey kramers  krnig relations .",
    "on purely empirical grounds , an observation of coexisting fast and slow relaxation processes in the viscosity suggests that we represent @xmath156 by a two - component spectrum .",
    "the simplest possibility is that given by eq .",
    "[ eq : model_viscosity ] , in which a drude - like lorenztian spectrum , of magnitude @xmath188 and width @xmath129 , rides on top of a broad background of magnitude @xmath45 . by causality",
    ", there must be an associated imaginary component , @xmath189 .",
    "this combines with the elastic contribution , @xmath63 , to form the effective pinning constant @xmath173 , given by eq .",
    "[ eq : model_pinning ] . using this model ,",
    "we have carried out simultaneous fits to the measured frequency dependence of @xmath75 and @xmath172 , at _ all _ fields and temperatures .",
    "representative results , in 10  k temperature steps up to 50  k , are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : visc_fits1 ] , [ fig : visc_fits4 ] and [ fig : visc_fits7 ] , at fields of 1 , 4 and 7  t , respectively .",
    "at all but the lowest temperatures and fields , the ability of the model to capture the observed dynamics is outstanding .",
    "( for the @xmath190  k , @xmath191  t data , the discrepancy in @xmath173 is consistent with proximity to a cyclotron resonance , something that is very interesting in its own right and will be investigated in detail in future measurements . )",
    "importantly , the multiple frequency data now overconstrain the model . and , although these are four - parameter fits , only two of the parameters ( @xmath188 and @xmath129 ) relate to frequency dependence : @xmath45 and @xmath63 are additive offsets .",
    "it is therefore impressive that , at all but the highest temperatures , the frequency dependence of @xmath75 essentially _ predicts _ that of @xmath172 , and _",
    "vice versa_. we draw two conclusions from the goodness of the fits : that the measurements themselves are accurate ; and that the single - vortex model provides a very good representation of the microwave dynamics .",
    "the need for a two - component spectrum is a clear indication that fast and slowly relaxing excitations coexist in the vortex state . at first sight",
    "this is not surprising , since quasiparticles in @xmath7-wave superconductors are known to have strongly energy - dependent relaxation rates as a consequence of the nodal quasiparticle spectrum.@xcite however , the fast - and - slow dichotomy observed in @xmath152 , especially at higher fields , is too pronounced to arise from thermally averaging over a distribution of relaxation rates dependent on energy alone .",
    "an alternative explanation , more in keeping with the disconnected nature of the broad and narrow parts of @xmath152 , is that the fast and slow processes are occurring in _ spatially distinct _ regions .",
    "since the narrow component of @xmath152 appears to be characteristic of @xmath7-wave quasiparticle physics , the slow processes are most naturally associated with regions _ outside _ the cores . by extension , we would then associate fast relaxation with processes involving the vortex cores .",
    "a picture of spatially separate relaxation mechanisms also helps to make sense of the sudden disappearance of slow relaxation above @xmath168 seen in fig .",

    "[ fig : btphasediagram ] , @xmath171 lies in the vortex - liquid regime , above the vortex - lattice melting line @xmath170,@xcite showing that , on its own , melting of the vortex - lattice does not eliminate the long - lived excitations .",
    "instead , @xmath171 is likely a dynamical crossover at which thermally fluctuating vortices begin to move on a timescale similar to that of the microwave measurement frequency .",
    "the parameters from the fits to eqs .",
    "[ eq : model_viscosity ] and [ eq : model_pinning ] are : the elastic pinning constant , @xmath63 ; the viscosity terms @xmath45 and @xmath188 ; and the viscosity relaxation rate , @xmath129 .",
    "@xmath186 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphab ] as the dc limit of @xmath173 : note that @xmath63 fairly closely follows the 2.64  ghz pinning constant data .",
    "we see that it remains finite above the melting temperature .",
    "this is at odds with bulk measurements , for which the melting transition marks the resistive onset.@xcite a likely reason for this is that _",
    "surface pinning _ plays an important role in the microwave measurements : the loss of shear stiffness experienced at the melting transition has a profound effect on the ability of point - like defects to pin the vortex lattice ; for planar defects such as the sample surface , shear stiffness is irrelevant .",
    "this observation also serves as a warning that microwave techniques are not necessarily a good probe of bulk pinning . nevertheless , by narrowing the distribution of elastic forces experienced by vortices visible to the microwave fields , surface pinning likely works to our advantage , improving the applicability of the single - vortex model .",
    "the dynamical component of @xmath172 also helps in this respect , as it arises from interactions with the electron fluid rather than from randomly distributed defects .",
    "the viscosity terms @xmath192 and @xmath193 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : viscosity_params ] , with the latter quantity appearing as part of @xmath194 . @xmath192 closely tracks the 13.97  ghz viscosity , and is very similar in magnitude to the viscosity inferred by parks _",
    "et al . _ from terahertz measurements on yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath177 ( @xmath195 to 88",
    "k ) , suggesting that the @xmath45 component of the viscosity extends over a very broad frequency range , up to terahertz frequencies .    the final fit parameter from eqs .",
    "[ eq : model_viscosity ] and [ eq : model_pinning ] , @xmath196 , is plotted separately , in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] . at the lowest temperatures ,",
    "@xmath197 is of the order of several  ghz .",
    "this is comparable to the width of zero - field quasiparticle conductivity spectra in ortho - ii yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath198,@xcite providing one of the pieces of evidence linking vortex dissipation to the @xmath7-wave quasiparticles .",
    "@xmath196 initially grows linearly with temperature , also in accord with the behaviour inferred from zero - field measurements , in which the form of the temperature dependence of the scattering in ortho - ii yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 is taken as being indicative of weak - limit scattering of nodal quasiparticles.@xcite it is interesting that @xmath196 is comparable to the quasiparticle relaxation rate in zero field , as it indicates that the vortex lattice does not contribute strongly to quasiparticle scattering .",
    "vortices are large on the scale of the fermi wavelength and would be expected to act as a source of small - angle scattering : such processes are known to be ineffective at relaxing charge currents in @xmath7-wave superconductors.@xcite in contrast , small - angle scattering should have a strong effect on the rate of _ intra - nodal _ transitions , and be very effective at randomizing the quasiparticle group velocity.@xcite as a result , quasiparticles should become diffusively confined in the vortex lattice , even while electrical transport measurements , such as the ones presented here , indicate mean free paths much larger than the inter - vortex spacing",
    ". the vortex lattice should instead be responsible for new quasiparticle effects , such as pair - breaking induced by doppler shifting of quasiparticle energies.@xcite these should grow in importance with @xmath121 , and may be responsible for the increase in @xmath192 at higher fields . on passing through the melting temperature , @xmath196 starts to increase rapidly , then appears to plateau above the dynamical crossover with @xmath199  ghz in the higher - field data sets .",
    "this frequency scale is substantially smaller than that expected for quasiparticle scattering in this temperature range , and is perhaps connected to superconducting fluctuations .",
    "finally , we obtain an estimate of the flux - flow resistivity , @xmath200 , from the vortex - dynamics data .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we are faced with a trade - off when measuring @xmath200 in any real material , due to the presence of pinning : we must either use large currents that depin the vortices ( for cuprates , an increasingly difficult prospect as temperature is lowered@xcite ) ; or measure the linear response at high frequencies and work back towards the static limit .",
    "having taken the latter approach , we define a frequency - dependent flux - flow resistivity , @xmath201 , which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_ff ] . at all fields and frequencies",
    ", @xmath202 shows an initial drop on cooling through @xmath154 , a broad minimum in the 8  to  20  k range , and an upturn at low temperatures  this is a reflection of the peaked structure in @xmath153 .",
    "the most remarkable aspect of the data is that , at the lower frequencies , the low temperature upturns appear to follow a @xmath15 form .",
    "this is reminiscent of the behaviour of the dc resistivity in the pseudogap regime,@xcite raising the interesting possibility that the two effects are connected .",
    "in summary , this work builds on a number of technical advances in microwave spectroscopy of the vortex state : the use of high @xmath116 dielectric resonators , allowing high sensitivity measurements on small single crystals ; the ability to simultaneously measure real and imaginary parts of the impedance at each frequency , allowing a clean separation of viscous and elastic effects ; measurement over a wide range of microwave frequencies ; and measurements as a function of magnetic field . applied to a high - purity single crystal of ortho - ii yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ,",
    "these developments come together to reveal the vortex dynamics in unprecedented detail , uncovering a close connection between the vortex viscosity @xmath152 and the zero - field dynamics of the @xmath7-wave quasiparticles .",
    "the vortex viscosity is revealed to have strong frequency dependence and , when treated as a complex - valued quantity , is consistent with the tight constraints causality places on physical response functions .",
