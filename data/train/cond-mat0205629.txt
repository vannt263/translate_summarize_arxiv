    "the 2deg - barrier-2deg junctions used by kang _ et .  al . _",
    "@xcite consisted of two regions of 2deg of widths @xmath46 m and @xmath47 m , where the electrons live in the two - dimensional interface of the gaas - algaas heterostructure , separated by 88- thick @xmath48/alas barrier of height 220 mev . these junctions are believed to be atomically precise , which means that they have very few defects on their entire length . in the experiment",
    "the conductance at @xmath49 showed an oscillatory behavior as a function of bias voltage with successive peaks spaced by an energy of the order of the cyclotron energy @xmath50 in the full range of magnetic field .",
    "this effect suggests that there is a mixing between landau levels enabled by a level shift due to large bias voltage .",
    "however , for fillings @xmath51 and @xmath52 , a sharp conductance peak dominates at zero bias .",
    "the peak heights were @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively for the samples published , but the height typically varies from sample to sample , always being of the order of @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "= .30    the model hamiltonian for the set up of the experiment of kang and coworkers that we will use here is a variant of the one considered by kane and fisher  @xcite .",
    "we will make the simplifying assumption the electron - electron interactions at the barrier are sufficiently well screened so that they can be represented by effective short range intra - edge and inter - edge interactions .",
    "while this assumption is not fully justified it represents a minor change to the physics of the system .",
    "thus , the effects of the width of the barrier are included in the matrix element .",
    "the right and left moving branches represent the edge states of two @xmath37 qh states laterally coupled by the barrier .",
    "these edges have non - vanishing fermi wavevectors equal in magnitude ( for a symmetric barrier ) and with opposite direction indicating the chiral nature of the edge states .",
    "back scattering is forbidden everywhere due to momentum conservation and in the absence of a periodic potential there is no umklapp scattering .",
    "the electron - electron interactions are thus purely due to  forward scattering \" both intra and inter edge , which conserve chirality .",
    "thus , under these assumptions , the pair of edge states behaves effectively like a single non - chiral one - dimensional luttinger liquid , with an effective velocity @xmath56 and an effective luttinger coupling constant @xmath57 .",
    "the main effect of the impurity is to provide for a backscattering center at the impurity site which we will define to be the origin , @xmath58 .",
    "the model that we will discuss and solve for two coupled @xmath37 edges with opposite chirality can be easily extended to discuss the same issues for fractional quantum hall states . however ,",
    "for reasonable values of the dimensionless coupling constant ( defined below ) the resulting effective luttinger parameter is always in the range @xmath59 in which tunneling is suppressed and no zbc peak can be observed .",
    "thus , for the rest of this paper we will restrict our discussion to the case @xmath60 in which there are no fractional quantum hall states ( for fully polarized systems ) .",
    "the system can thus be treated as if it were effectively one - dimensional , _",

    "@xmath65 is given by @xmath67 where we assumed the speed of right and left moving electrons to be same with @xmath56 , and the third term stands for the density - density interaction between chiral electrons .",
    "the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath57 , which measures the strength of the interaction , can be estimated to be @xmath68 where , for the case of coulomb interactions , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the effective distance between the two edges , @xmath71 is the static dielectric constant , and @xmath72 is the fermi energy for the edge states , assumed to be the same on both sides of barrier .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that in practice there is no reliable way to determine @xmath57 in terms of microscopic parameters .",
    "still , this lowest order estimation implies that coulomb interaction must be fairly strong in the actual experimental setup . in any case",
    ", we expect that the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath57 should be a smooth function of the bulk filling factor @xmath73 and of the thickness of the barrier .",
    "intuitively we expect that as the filling factor increases , either by raising the electron density or by decreasing the magnetic field , the effective distance between the edges of the two quantum hall liquids will decrease .",
    "consequently we expect that the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath57 will increase as the filling factor increases .",
    "we will see below that this effect will play an important role in the explanation of the effects seen in the experiments of kang and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "we will represent the effects of back - scattering at the tunneling center ( at the origin ) by a local tunneling operator which in terms of right and left moving electron creation and annihilation operators has the standard form @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the tunneling amplitude .",

    "in contrast to the zero temperature behavior of indefinite running , the effective tunneling coupling @xmath81 stops running at a certain value @xmath180 determined by the temperature at finite temperature . as in all quantum phase transitions  @xcite , this effect in turn leads to the appearance of a finite temperature - dependent crossover scale @xmath181 .",
    "furthermore , now both temperature and external voltage act as natural crossover energy scales . from the point of view of our scenario ,",

    "the reappearance of the peak near @xmath184 will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the rest of this section will be devoted to our understanding on the first four aspects .",
    "a central feature of this problem is the powerful fact that the differential tunneling conductance @xmath157 is a universal scaling function of two dimensionless ratios , @xmath185 and @xmath179 .",
    "first of all , the system behaves qualitatively as if it were at @xmath34 so long as the temperature is the smallest among three energy scales i.  e.  , @xmath186 . in this regime",
    "the system flows to the stable fixed point at @xmath187 where the tunneling current is large and the conductance saturates to its largest value @xmath188 at zbc .",

    "hence , in contrast with the case @xmath88 we expect only a crossover , instead of a phase transition .",
    "in particular this also means that , at low but fixed temperature @xmath6 , we should see an appreciable _ increase _ in @xmath157 when @xmath4 becomes smaller than @xmath192 , since @xmath192 will be finite at non - zero temperature .",
    "however , as @xmath4 becomes comparable to @xmath6 the system will begin to be driven by thermal fluctuations , and the coupling @xmath81 would no longer increase further as the voltage is lowered , thus leading to a saturation of the tunneling conductance at a value determined by temperature .",
    "therefore , even though the zbc peak should be observable due to an increase in @xmath157 as the voltage is lowered past @xmath192 , the height of the peak ( essentially determined by the temperature ) would be much lower than the zero temperature saturation value @xmath159 .",
    "conversely , if the temperature is higher than @xmath5 , thermal fluctuations dominate for all values of @xmath4 and no zbc peak should be observed .    on the other hand , in the regime where the filling factor is such that @xmath36 , the dependence of @xmath5 on the tunneling amplitude @xmath81 is such ( see eq .",

    "hence , we conclude that there is a singularity at @xmath218 , simply illustrating the fact that the coupling runs indefinitely only at zero temperature due to the underlying quantum phase transition at @xmath219 .",
    "this implies that all we should be able to see at any finite temperature is be a crossover from @xmath220 to @xmath221 near @xmath222 at which the tunneling increase rapidly as @xmath1 becomes smaller than @xmath223 , giving rise to a pronounced zbc peak as @xmath73 is increased pass @xmath224 .",
    "this explains why the experiment sees a rapid increase of the zbc peak when @xmath73 is increased past @xmath225 , even though we expect @xmath226 due to the effects of the coulomb interaction .",
    "furthermore , since the behavior of @xmath38-function is quite different for @xmath205 and @xmath34 , we expect a crossover near @xmath227 , which was discussed earlier in relation to the existence of peak region with finite width and the low height of the peak in the region .",
    "these crossover effects , and the behavior of the beta - function , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] .",
    "this result illustrates our general statement that it is the competition between the temperature and the bias voltage what enables us to observe the conductance peak , and the height of the peak can be much lower than the saturation value @xmath159 since the observable height will be limited by the temperature .",
    "this result also supports our argument that competition between @xmath6 and @xmath5 eventually leads to the disappearance of peak as the filling factor is raised further past a value @xmath0 .    in this section",
    ", we gave a detailed analysis of the experimental predictions of our model , which was developed in the previous section .",
    "after mapping the problem to bsg model , by borrowing known exact results of bsg problem and calculating the relevant @xmath38-function , we suggested consistent explanations to so far not understood peculiar features of the experiment by kang and coworkers . in our picture ,",
    "finite temperature effects are responsible for the observability of a zbc peak with an unexpectedly low value of its height , as well as to the finite width in filling factors where the peak is observed .",
    "our picture is a natural consistent scenario for the appearance of the zbc peak in the wide range of filling factor near @xmath147 . in the next section",
    "we will show that the reappearance of the zbc peak in the range of filling factor near @xmath184 in principle can also be understood by following closely the approach of this section for the @xmath147 case but now considering the possibility of a partially spin - polarized state near @xmath184 .",
    "to understand the peak in the @xmath184 region , we first note that this peak region begins abruptly near @xmath184 in apparently similar manner as it does near @xmath147  @xcite . in the bulk system ,",
    "as the filling factor becomes comparable to @xmath228 , the electron spin begins to matter , as the spin reversed states begin to get progressively occupied .",
    "thus , even if the 2deg is fully polarized for @xmath229 , spin plays a crucial role for @xmath228 . in addition , for samples with high nominal electronic density , spin fluctuations are known to become important and in some cases so much that the ground state may even be a spin singlet .",
    "however , this situation requires samples with fairly high densities , which is presumably not the case in the experiment of kang and coworkers .",
    "hence , a natural extension of the picture that we advocated for in the previous section , as it stands applicable only for fully polarized 2degs , simply requires to take into account the changes in the physics brought about by the electron spin , and in particular of the role played by both zeeman and exchange interactions .",
    "this extension should be applicable to both spin singlet and non - singlet cases .",
    "however , once the spin degree of freedom is included , there is a richer class of possible behaviors , for there are now three possible types of tunneling corresponding to tunneling of charge and/or spin degree of freedom . in",
    "what follows we will be interested mostly in the regime in which the spin polarization is not large .",
    "hence , we will assume a reference state in which the up and down spin branches have the same filling factor @xmath230 , and investigate the effects of the zeeman term which will tend to polarize the state .",
    "we will focus on states with total filling factor @xmath231 .",
    "for these states the outermost edge is a @xmath37 edge ( per spin component ) .",
    "the effects of the magnetic field thus enters in the choice of the range of filling factor @xmath232 , in the presence of spin exchange interactions , and in the effects of the zeeman term as well as other possible @xmath233 symmetry breaking terms on the edge states .",
    "we will consider two different physical situations : 1 ) when the @xmath233 symmetry of spin is broken either by a ( large ) zeeman term , in which case the ground state may be polarized ( although not necessarily fully polarized ) , or by magnetic anisotropy terms ( expected to be very small in these systems ) , and 2 ) when the zeeman term is small enough that the ground state is a singlet at @xmath43 .",
    "there are a number of other interesting cases , such as the singlet and partially polarized states at @xmath234 which will not be discussed here .",
    "these states have interesting tunneling properties  @xcite but do not exhibit the zbc peak in the tunneling conductance that we are discussing here .",
    "the hamiltonian density that was studied in the previous section can be easily modified to account for the spin degree of freedom and its interactions .",
    "thus , we write the hamiltonian density in terms of the spin dependent chiral electron densities @xmath235 , with spin projection @xmath236 .",
    "furthermore spin - spin exchange interaction and the zeeman term should now be included in the hamiltonian density .",
    "let us define charge densities operators of chiral modes as @xmath237 , and the three - component spin densities operator @xmath238 , where @xmath239 are pauli matrices , with @xmath240 .",
    "the hamiltonian density for the system of two coupled edges can be written as a sum of charge and spin hamiltonians , @xmath241 the charge hamiltonian is given by @xmath242 where both the bare edge velocity and the effects of the intra - edge interactions are absorbed in the effective charge velocity @xmath243 .",
    "we will write the spin part of the hamiltonian as a sum of two terms @xmath244 where @xmath233 invariant part has the form  @xcite @xmath245 here @xmath246 includes the effects of intra - edge spin interactions and @xmath247 is the inter - edge strength of the exchange interaction .",
    "we have used a simple and rather crude model to estimate the inter - edge exchange coupling constant .",
    "we modelled the barrier with a potential @xmath248 of height @xmath249 and width @xmath250 .",
    "we find that , as expected , due to the antisymmetry of the wave function the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath247 has ferromagnetic sign , and that its magnitude has a rapid dependence of @xmath251 where @xmath252 is the fermi wave vector of the edge states . for a barrier of width @xmath253 and height @xmath254 , and for a model in which correleations enter only in the antisymmetry of the wave function , we estimate that reasonable values of the dimensionless inter - edge exchange coupling constant are quite small , typically in the range @xmath255 to @xmath256 . while it is quite possible that we are underestimating the magnitude of @xmath247 it seems unlikely that a realistic value can be larger by more that an order of magnitude . in addition , we show below that for the ferromagnetic sign , inter - edge exchange interactions are ( marginally ) irrelevant .",

    "thus , the single electron tunneling term is a relevant perturbation , and the coupling constant @xmath81 flows to strong coupling in this case .",
    "therefore , there should also be a zero - bias peak in the tunneling conductance in the case of a @xmath43 spin singlet quantum hall state , with qualitatively similar properties as the zero bias tunneling peak for the spin polarized case . with ferromagnetic exchange interactions and ising like anisotropy , in which case",

    "this scenario is consistent with the experimental observation which displays a very close similarity between the manner in which peak region appears abruptly and disappears gradually in both @xmath147 and @xmath184 . since the operator @xmath346 mixes the spin and the charge sectors , in the regime in which this operator is relevant it induces a non - zero tunneling current of both charge and spin .",
    "hence if the observed zbc peak near @xmath184 is indeed caused by the single particle tunneling operator in the phase without a spin gap , we expect that a _ spin conductance _ peak should be observable near @xmath9 but not near @xmath0 , in marked contrast to charge conductance which would show a zbc peak near both filling factors .    in this section",
    ", we extended the picture we advocated for in the previous sections to the case of small spin polarization near @xmath184 and investigated the changes in physics brought about by the electron spin .",
    "it was pointed out that the interplay between the zeeman term and the exchange term enables us to identify two different phases in terms of their spin transport properties even in the absence of any point contact operator : a spin - gap phase in which the spin excitations along the edge are gapped , and hence perfect spin tunneling , and a phase with gapless spin excitations . in both cases , there is no charge tunneling current in the absence of a point contact .",
    "since in most cases of physical interest the edge states are likely to be in the gapless phase at least for a large enough zeeman interaction , we proposed that here too there is a crossover in single electron tunneling processes through a point contact leading to the reappearance of the zero bias peak near @xmath184 . in our picture , the apparent similarities in the patterns in which the peak region begins and disappears near two filling factors @xmath147 and @xmath184 in the experiment by kang and coworkers can be understood in a natural and consistent way .",
    "the reappearance of peak region near @xmath184 had been totally unexplained in previous theories of tunneling between laterally coupled fqh states  @xcite .",
    "we also discussed a number of interesting two - particle tunneling processes and the interesting behavior of spin tunneling in these systems .",
    "in summary , in this paper we proposed a theoretical explanation of the questions raised by experiments of kang and coworkers  @xcite , by modeling the system as a pair of coupled chiral luttinger liquid with a point contact . using standard bosonization methods we mapped the problem to the tunneling problem in luttinger liquids first discussed by kane and fisher  @xcite .",
    "our results show that the inter - edge coulomb interaction reduces the luttinger parameter and moves the system deep into the strong coupling regime for @xmath147 leading to the appearance of zero - bias peak in the tunneling conductance with a peak value at @xmath88 of @xmath355 , with @xmath36 .",
    "we mapped the problem to integrable boundary sine - gordon theory , and used the known exact results of bsg problem to obtain predictions for the behavior of the tunneling conductance . by considering a special solvable case , we determined the behavior of the conductance for all temperature and voltages .",
    "we investigated several crossovers of interest by introducing an appropriate @xmath38-function .",
    "this analysis showed that the crossover between the @xmath88 behavior and the @xmath356 behavior yields a natural explanation of the low value of the `` zero bias conductance peak '' measured in the experiment  @xcite .",
    "we also showed that the gradual disappearance of the peak as the filling factor is increased past @xmath0 can be ascribed to the crossover between @xmath221 and @xmath220 .",
    "furthermore , we considered the role of spin in this tunnel junctions and showed that the reappearance of the zbc peak in the region near filling factor @xmath184 can be understood if we assume that there is a ( possibly small ) spin polarization near @xmath184 .",
    "we extended the approach we used for fully polarized electrons with @xmath147 to partially spin polarized and unpolarized electrons with @xmath184 , by taking into account the role of zeeman interactions , exchange interactions and magnetic anisotropies .",
    "we discussed in detail the phase diagram of the system in this case and showed that the tunneling signature depends on whether the spin sector is gapped or not .",
    "we showed that the picture near @xmath147 can be naturally extended to this new regime , and that the single particle tunneling operator can also give rise to a zero - bias tunneling conductance peak in both charge transport and spin transport in the gapless phase .",
    "higher order ( multi - particle ) point contact operators can in principle lead to charge only or spin only tunneling , depending on the value of luttinger parameters @xmath285 and @xmath297 . on the other hand , we found that spin transport along the edge is gapped even in the absence of point contact when zeeman term is small and if there is a very weak @xmath263-like magnetic anisotropy or if the exchange interaction is anti - ferromagnetic . in this regime",
    "we expect perfect tunneling of the spin current which suggest future experimental tests of these ideas .",
    "even though the single electron tunneling is exponentially suppressed in the spin - gap phase , the singlet pair tunneling can lead to a zbc peak in the presence of strong coulomb interaction .",
    "our scenario is based on the assumption of single tunneling center .",
    "when the bias voltage and and the coupling between edge modes on each side of the barrier are weak enough to give a low peak in the tunneling conductance , as is observed in the experiment , the scenario of tunneling through a single tunneling center is quite likely to be an accurate description of the physics .",
    "even though our picture is applicable only near ( and above ) @xmath37 and @xmath43 , it offers a natural explanation of many salient features of the experiment which were not explained so far .",
    "this picture offers a consistent explanation for the reappearance of the zbc peak and of the observed similarity in the manner in which the two peak regions near @xmath147 and @xmath184 appear and disappear .",
    "our results also indicate that temperature should play an important role , and that a temperature dependence of the data is needed to understand what is going on .",
    "in particular we predict that as temperature is lowered the crossover filling factor @xmath10 will be lowered , and that the width of the peak region ( in filling factor ) as well as the height of the the zbc peak will increase .",
    "we also anticipate a region with zbc peak in spin conductance near @xmath9 but not near @xmath0 .",
    "we find that there are more than one mechanisms through which spin tunneling can happen and depending on the channel , the spin tunneling may or may not be accompanied by charge tunneling .",
    "although in this paper we considered only the simplest possible case of a single tunneling center it is interesting to investigate the effects of more than one impurity . while we have not investigated this problem extensively , it is clear that there should be interesting interference effects if there is more than one tunneling center .",
    "indeed , some time ago chamon and coworkers  @xcite proposed an experiment based on a two - tunneling center device in the fractional quantum hall regime as a way to measure the fractional statistics of laughlin quasiparticles .",
    "we finally note that there is a recent paper by carpentier , peca and balents  @xcite on a related problem .",
    "carpentier and coworkers calculated the tunneling current between interacting luttinger liquids constructed in a similar geometry as the geometry of experiment by kang and coworkers .",
    "they showed that electron fractionalization can be probed from multiple branch points of current density .",
    "however , both the effect of charging(leaking ) from(to ) the bulk system and the absence of chirality constraint make the system considered in the ref .",
    "@xcite quite different from the system considered in this paper in connection to the experiment by kang and coworkers .",

    "<S> we show that for filling factors @xmath0 the effects of the coulomb interactions move the system deep into strong tunneling regime , by reducing the magnitude of the luttinger parameter @xmath1 , leading to the appearance of a zero - bias differential conductance peak of magnitude @xmath2 at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the abrupt appearance of the zero bias peak as the filling factor is increased past a value @xmath3 , and its gradual disappearance thereafter can be understood as a crossover controlled by the main energy scales of this system : the bias voltage @xmath4 , the crossover scale @xmath5 , and the temperature @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the low height of the zero bias peak @xmath7 observed in the experiment , and its broad finite width , can be understood naturally within this picture . </S>",
    "<S> also , the abrupt reappearance of the zero - bias peak for @xmath8 can be explained as an effect caused by spin reversed electrons , _ i.  e. _ if the 2deg is assumed to have a small polarization near @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict that as the temperature is lowered @xmath10 should decrease , and the width of zero - bias peak should become wider . </S>",
    "<S> this picture also predicts the existence of similar zero bias peak in the spin tunneling conductance near for @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the edge states of two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) in high magnetic fields reflect the structure of the hilbert spaces of bulk fractional , and integer , quantum hall ( fqh ) states . in the absence of edge reconstruction </S>",
    "<S> , the low energy hilbert spaces of fqh edge states can be represented by a suitable set of chiral luttinger liquids  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this identification brought considerable interest in the study of fqh edge states as a well controlled laboratory for experimental exploration of quantum transport properties of luttinger liquids . </S>",
    "<S> much effort has been devoted to the theoretical  @xcite and experimental study of tunneling of both between fqh edge states  @xcite and into fqh edge states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> measurements  @xcite of electron tunneling from a bulk doped - gaas electron into the sharp edge of a fqh state with filling fractions @xmath11 have confirmed the existence of both the scaling regime  @xcite and the crossover behavior  @xcite predicted by the chiral luttinger liquid picture . </S>",
    "<S> however , many important open questions remain about the actual observed behavior of the tunneling exponent and its consistency with the physics of the bulk fqh states ( see , for instance  @xcite , and references therein ) .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , w.  kang and coworkers  @xcite have measured the differential tunneling conductance of a device in which two 2deg s in the integer quantum hall regime are laterally coupled through an atomically precise tunneling barrier . </S>",
    "<S> their data shows a very sharp and intense differential conductance peak of height @xmath12 at zero bias for certain ranges of magnetic field on top of an oscillatory behavior , which appears in qualitatively same manner for all range of magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the data shows an abrupt appearance and the following gradual disappearance of the zero bias conductance ( zbc ) peak as the filling factor is increased past apparent threshold values @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the height of the zbc peak they observed is considerably smaller than the quantum of conductance @xmath15 and the zbc peak was observed over a fairly broad range of filling fractions ( @xmath16 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data of kang _ et .  </S>",
    "<S> al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite shows no zbc peak in the tunneling conductance for @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical explanation of the experiment of kang and coworkers has focused on the fact that it is not possible to tunnel electrons between two perfectly aligned fqh edges with opposite chirality  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if the barrier is assumed to be atomically precise , the only way in which tunneling can possibly take place is by the anti - crossing of landau levels belonging to both sides of the barrier  @xcite . in the landau gauge @xmath18 , where @xmath19 direction is chosen perpendicular to the barrier and @xmath20 direction along the barrier </S>",
    "<S> , the single particle wave function has a form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an eigenfunction of the hamiltonian @xmath23 , with @xmath24 a potential due to barrier which is symmetric about @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion curves originating from the two systems on both sides of the barrier overlap around @xmath26 . at the crossing points , gaps open as a consequence of a coupling between the counter propagating edge states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed the scenario assumed in the work of kang and coworkers  @xcite and by mitra and girvin  @xcite , lee and yang  @xcite , kollar and sachdev  @xcite , and by an earlier calculation by takagaki and ploog  @xcite .    in this picture </S>",
    "<S> , the appearance of a zero - bias conductance peak is ascribed to the existence of a gap in the spectrum of edge states at the barrier , since a gap suppresses the conduction channel along the barrier provided by unmixed edge states with opposite chirality formed by the barrier . </S>",
    "<S> mitra and girvin  @xcite , as well as kollar and sachdev  @xcite , observed that electron - electron interactions yield a substantial modification of the gap which can not be accounted for by level mixing arguments . in these theories , the gap is equal to the soliton energy of a quantum sine - gordon model , derived from a microscopic theory of the barrier . </S>",
    "<S> notice that , due to the landau level mixing induced by the barrier , the effective fermi wave vector of the barrier states is @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> thus a gap in the spectrum does not require backscattering in this geometry . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , mitra and girvin  @xcite used a hartree - fock theory to calculate the luttinger liquid parameter , the collective mode velocity , and the momentum cutoff of the effective sine - gordon theory . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that coulomb interaction , which is taken into account in hartree - fock , leads to a substantial enhancement of the gap . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , kollar and sachdev  @xcite , used a method of matched asymptotics to determine the momentum cutoff for sine - gordon theory . </S>",
    "<S> the gap they found is larger than the result of mitra and girvin .    </S>",
    "<S> however , even with the gap obtained by kollar and sachdev  @xcite it is not possible to understand the height of the zero - bias conductance peak . </S>",
    "<S> both references  @xcite and  @xcite predict on general grounds a zero - bias peak with height @xmath15 , larger than the experimental result @xmath28 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by approximately one order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in this picture the zbc peak is expected above the second landau level in the non - interacting system , whereas peak region was prominent near @xmath29 in the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> ( interaction effects do not modified this result in any essential way . ) </S>",
    "<S> given these facts it was argued in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and  @xcite that effects of disorder may be ultimately responsible for these discrepancies between theory and experiment .    in search of an answer to these questions </S>",
    "<S> , we reexamined the alternative scenario of tunneling between counter - circulating edge states through an imperfection of the tunneling barrier . </S>",
    "<S> we were motivated partly by the observation that the effects of anti - crossing induced by the barrier are not expected to occur at least before the second landau level begins to be filled , which is not the regime in which the zero - bias peak first appears . </S>",
    "<S> thus we will assume the more standard situation of a barrier separating two fqh states with edges of opposite chirality and non - vanishing fermi wave - vectors . </S>",
    "<S> under these circumstances tunneling is only allowed if impurities and imperfections are present . </S>",
    "<S> this is a possibility that must be considered seriously particularly given that in the end impurity scattering is invoked as the explanation for the magnitude of the zero - bias peak , as advocated in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in this paper we will assume that the barrier is precise enough to have just a few imperfections which act as weak tunneling centers . </S>",
    "<S> in fact we will assume that there is just one such tunneling center .    </S>",
    "<S> in the situation of the experiment of kang _ et .  </S>",
    "<S> al . </S>",
    "<S> _ , where right and left moving edges were spatially separated by a barrier , a local deformation of the edges due for instance to an impurity can result in a weak tunneling center which mimics the pinch - off effect of the patterned back gate electrode of the experiment by milliken , umbach and webb  @xcite . the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have observed expected temperature dependence of tunneling conductance through point contact  @xcite for @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> however , a quite unique feature of the set up of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is that it can explore not only the effect of back scattering through a ( presumably ) point contact , but also the effects of electron - electron interactions along the edges .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that the electron - electron interaction plays a crucial role in the tunneling conductance . </S>",
    "<S> electron - electron interactions turn the pair of edge states into a single non - chiral luttinger liquid with an effective luttinger parameter @xmath31 for filling factors @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this problem can be mapped into the problem of a junction in a luttinger liquid first studied by kane and fisher  @xcite , with a luttinger parameter reduced from @xmath33 due to the effects of the coulomb interactions along the barrier , which brings the system to strong tunneling phase if it were at @xmath34 . in references  @xcite and  @xcite , kane and </S>",
    "<S> fisher pointed out that for @xmath35 , tunneling at a point contact is a relevant perturbation and the system flows to a strong coupling regime . while @xmath36 suggests that the threshold for a zero - bias peak should be observed at a filling factor somewhat below @xmath37 , we find that there is a non - trivial temperature dependence of the height and width of the zero - bias peak induced by the renormalization flow of the tunneling operator .    </S>",
    "<S> we studied the effects of finite temperature by mapping the problem to boundary sine - gordon ( bsg ) problem which is exactly solvable . by combining a number of known exact results of the bsg theory with the calculation of an appropriate renormalization group @xmath38-function </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest a natural explanation of the salient features of the experiment of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we studied in detail the crossover behavior of the tunneling conductance as a function of temperature and found that it can explain qualitatively the observations of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that finite temperature is responsible for both the low height of the peak and its gradual disappearance when the filling factor is increased past @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> further experimental studies of the temperature dependence of the zero - bias peak can check these theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we give an explicit expression for the temperature dependence of the differential conductance at zero bias voltage for the particular value of the luttinger parameter @xmath39 . for more general values of the luttinger parameter the solutions are more complicated but nevertheless vary smoothly and slowly with @xmath1 ( see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> although the data that has been published so far of the experiment of kang and coworkers  @xcite is at a temperature of @xmath40 , unpublished data from the same group in the temperature range @xmath41 to @xmath42 is well described by our results  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also studied tunnel junctions at a barrier in partially spin - polarized qh states . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the reappearance of the peak region near @xmath9 can be explained if the electron gas is not fully polarized but instead has a small spin polarization . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider in this paper the interesting case of a line junction in a spin singlet @xmath43 state . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for these qh states , at @xmath8 a spin - spin interaction across a single point junction leads to a number of interesting effects in both spin and charge transport across the junction .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : model ] , we introduce the model for a iqh - barrier - iqh junction with a single tunneling center and bosonize the model . in section [ sec : bsg ] we map the model to the integrable bsg model by using a standard folding procedure . </S>",
    "<S> the result will be used to understand the experiment near @xmath44 . in section [ sec : spinful ] we propose an explanation for the experimental results near @xmath45 with the assumption that there is a small spin polarization for @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> here we generalize our analysis and discuss the role of exchange , zeeman and magnetic anisotropy interactions on tunneling processes . finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] we review our main results and give some predictions on future experiment based on our analysis . </S>"
