    "the timeline of publications for different journals and overall is presented in fig .",
    "it can be observed that the overall output ( bottom most color stripe ) increases steadily over time .",
    "an obvious exception is the world war ii period , during which the production dropped almost an order of magnitude , from nearly 100 publications per month before and after the war to below 10 during the war .",
    "this confirms , not surprisingly , that periods of war decelerate scientific progress or at least very much hinder the dissemination of new knowledge .    by geocoding the affiliations ,",
    "it is also possible to infer where the physics published in the physical review has been coming from . as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ geo ] and the accompanying video , the formative years of physical review were dominated by the us , with relatively rare contributions coming from the uk , germany , france and india . during the world wars i and ii large contingents of the world went silent ( see the video referred to in the caption of fig .",
    "[ geo ] ) , and it was only during the 1950s and 60s that the us centrism begun fading .",
    "the collapse of the soviet union , the fall of the berlin wall , and the related changes in world order during the 1980s and 90s contributed significantly to the globalization , so that today countries like china , russia , canada , japan , australia , as well as large regions of europe and south america all contribute markedly to physics research that is published in the physical review . countries that are still exempt are from central africa and sahara .",
    "ranking the countries according to their overall average monthly production during the last 20 years yields us , germany , france , uk , japan , italy , china , russia , spain , canada and netherlands , while per capita yields switzerland , israel , denmark , sweden , slovenia , finland , germany , netherlands , france and austria as the top 10 , respectively .",
    "these results are in good agreement with more comprehensive rankings that were recently published based on world citation and collaboration networks over many different fields of research @xcite .",
    "our goal here is solely to provide a general overview of the geographical origin of the data , and so we proceed with the core analysis of trends of physics discovery .",
    "to do so , we employ the methodology described in the methods section .",
    "results for the word `` quantum '' are presented in fig .",
    "[ time ] ( the n - gram viewer for publications of the american physical society is available at http://www.matjazperc.com/aps [ ] ) , where the vertical lines denote the starting times of windows during which the maximal upward and downward trends were recorded . by performing the same analysis on the whole data set and ranking the trends in a decreasing manner ( we use absolute values for negative slopes @xmath0 ) , we arrive at the biggest ever upward and downward movers across the whole publishing history of the american physical society . since",
    "the obtained tables are too big to be displayed meaningfully in print , we make them available online at http://www.matjazperc.com/aps/rankings [ ] , separately for all time windows @xmath1 and eligible journals .",
    "the physical review st : physics education research and physical review x ( prx ) do not have an extensive enough publication history to qualify for this analysis .",
    "although it would be interesting to comment on the trends of particular words and phrases and reconcile them with other historical accounts , the options for how to do that are simply too many to be meaningfully covered in this publication .",
    "we hope readers will find their favorites amongst the trendsetters and conduct experiments of their own . here",
    "we proceed with the focus on the large - scale properties of the trends .    as fig .",
    "[ dist ] demonstrates , the distributions of magnitude have heavy tails , largely independent of the direction of trend and journal .",
    "nevertheless , subtle differences can be inferred , and they deserve special attention .",
    "to determine the properties of the depicted distributions more accurately , we test several hypotheses .",
    "the first is that the depicted cumulative distributions follow a power law @xmath2 . by using maximum - likelihood fitting methods and goodness - of - fit tests based on the kolmogorov - smirnov statistics @xcite",
    ", we find that only for the journals depicted bold in the legend of fig .",
    "[ dist ] the power law is an acceptable fit .",
    "the distributions of downward trends for the physical review ( pr ) and physical review series i ( pri ) are best described by a power law with an exponential cut - off @xmath3 , while the distribution of upward trends for the physical review e ( pre ) is a stretched exponential @xmath4 .",
    "the pertaining exponents are summarized in table  [ fit ] .",
    ".[fit ] characterization of the distribution of the magnitude of trends reveals that for the majority the power law is an acceptable hypothesis .",
    "journals for which both the upward and downward trends follow a power law are denoted bold .",
    "we use @xmath5 as the threshold for acceptance @xcite .",
    "the distributions of downward trends for pr and pri are described best by a power law with an exponential cut - off having ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) and ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , respectively , while the distribution of upward trends for pre is a stretched exponential with ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) . for the distribution of upward trends for the reviews of modern physics ( rmp ) and for both distributions concerning physical review st : accelerators and beams ( prstab ) , none of the five considered functions , including the exponential and log - normal in addition to the three already mentioned , provide an acceptable fit . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     although distributions depicted in fig .",
    "[ dist ] are not the most beautiful power laws , and some altogether fail to conform to the power - law hypothesis , the prevalence of heavy tails nevertheless hints firmly towards robust large - scale self - organization governing the up and down trends . by defining the trend rate as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the smallest time interval between two consecutive trajectory points",
    ", we can directly test for the matthew effect .",
    "however , since the trajectories exhibit both up and down trends , we determine the upward and downward rates separately within time windows of maximal growth and decline .",
    "results presented in fig .  [ rate ] confirm that the more commonly used a given word or a phrase is , the larger its expected upward momentum is going to be .",
    "the same holds true for the magnitude of falls during times of decline .",
    "together with the continuity of scientific progress , the matthew effect gives rise to strong but rare trendsetters on the expense of the majority of discoveries that remain forever unknown except to those that made it .",
    "the model of growth and preferential attachment @xcite captures the essence of our observations .",
    "attachment rates that are linearly proportional with the degree of each node translate into power - law distributions , while deviations from the linear form lead to deviations in the corresponding distributions .",
    "near - linear attachment rates yield log - normal distributions @xcite , while sublinear attachment rates yield distributions with an exponential cut - off or stretched exponential distributions @xcite , depending further on the details of sublinearity .",
    "the accuracy of empirical studies will also be impaired by finite - size effects and saturation , which may additionally contribute to deviations from the power law @xcite . by contrasting the distributions in fig .",
    "[ dist ] with the corresponding rates depicted in fig",
    ".  [ rate ] , we find an agreement that is well aligned with the theoretical expectations . moreover , having a closer look at the journals for which the deviations from the linear rates are particularly strong , we find either that they were published in a time when abstracts were rare ( pri , partly also pr ) , that their publication history is relatively short ( pre , prstab ) , or that they publish reviews rather than original research ( rmp ) , all of which are probable causes for the analysis on this particular cases to give less conclusive results .",
    "the identified self - organization in the rise and fall of scientific paradigms can be seen akin to previous reports of preferential attachment in citation rates and the acquisition of scientific collaborators @xcite .",
    "specifically related to the former case , our discovery can be interpreted as the textual extension of the matthew effect in citation rates or as the large - scale `` semantic '' version of that effect .",
    "it is also worth noting that , although it is debatable whether the concept of preferential attachment is based on luck or reason @xcite , in our case at least it seems inevitably due to the actual progress made , not chance that could make one discovery seem bigger than it truly is .",
    "after identifying all unique words and phrases , we determine their relative frequency of occurrence @xmath14 with respect to the number of publications in any given month for each journal published by the american physical society as well as overall .",
    "we consider a phrase to be a string of words separated by a space , and we limit our analysis to at most four - word phrases to keep the volume of information to be processed manageable . by ignoring capitalization , numbers , words containing numbers , and formulae , we identify 118056 single words , 3269090 two - word phrases , 13295156 three - word phrases , and 23799449 four - word phrases , thus obtaining over 40 million trajectories that enable a qualitative exploration of the trends of physics discovery . while of course not all identified words and phrases have to do with physics , the assumption we make is that only those that do will actually exhibit notable trends .",
    "words like `` the '' or `` of '' appear in nearly every abstract .",
    "the word `` quantum '' , on the other hand , is mentioned first in the 1917 may issue of the physical review , with popularity subsequently peaking in january 1927 at @xmath15 , as depicted in fig .  [ time ] .",
    "trajectories of all other words and phrases can be searched for and viewed at http://www.matjazperc.com/aps [ ] .    however , since not all publications of the american physical society have an abstract , and since some abstracts are very short , even the most common words and phrases can occasionally exhibit relatively strong trends . not to treat those trends as trends of physics discovery",
    ", we eliminate from the analysis the most common english words as identified in @xcite , minus a few hand - picked special cases that obviously have to do with physics .",
    "we also eliminate phrases that contain the most common english words either at the beginning or end . with these two additional filters in place , we make sure that from all the identified unique words and phrases the focus is on those that , in the majority of cases , concern at least some aspect of physics .    to quantify the trends , we seek out time windows where the slope @xmath0 of the linear fit of each trajectory is maximally positive and maximally negative , and we do so separately for windows of width @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 years .",
    "the dispersal in years is important as we want our analysis to encompass short- , mid- and long - term trends .",
    "although a straight line wo nt be a good fit for the data in several cases , it is nevertheless a useful first - order approximation for whether a subject is trending up or down , and to what extent this is the case @xcite .",
    "recent most advances on how to identify trends in word frequency dynamics are presented in @xcite , and they shall be an excellent basis for future explorations .",
    "as starting points of each of the four considered time windows , we consider every month of every word and phrase for which data is available , with the obvious condition that the starting point plus the window width must not go beyond october 2012 . before the analysis we apply a 12 month moving average on the trajectories and",
    "require that the considered time windows must not contain missing data after averaging .",
    "moreover , we dismiss all words and phrases with @xmath20/year as lacking notable trends .",
