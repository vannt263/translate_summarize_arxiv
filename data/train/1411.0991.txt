    "since its launch in november 2004 , _ swift _ is performing an all - sky survey with the bat , covering the 14 - 195  kev energy range . thanks to the bat s wide field of view ( 1.4  sr , half - coded ) , its large detector area ( 5432 @xmath16 ) , and the random _ swift _ pointing strategy , the bat survey resulted in the most sensitive and uniform coverage of the hard x - ray sky @xcite .",
    "we analyzed the data from november 2004 until july 2013 , spanning a period of 104 months since the mission s launch .",
    "the bat survey raw data were retrieved from the _ swift _ public archive where they are stored in the form of detector plane histograms : three - dimensional arrays ( two spatial dimensions , one spectral dimension ) that collect count - rate data in 5-min time bins for 80 energy channels .",

    "a different possibility is that the observed excess is due to an additional continuum component , such as non - thermal bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "we therefore added to our continuum model a power - law component .",
    "the resulting fit with a synchrotron+power - law model is poor ( @xmath21=12 for 4 d.o.f . ) .",
    "in fact , the power - law flux in the 60 - 85  kev bin is constrained to @xmath140.8@xmath610@xmath13  photons@xmath8s@xmath9  by the non - detections in the adjacent 45 - 60  kev , and 85 - 110  kev bins , and can not account for all the observed emission .",
    "in order to check whether the observed excess in the 65 - 80 kev band could be an artifact we performed the following tests : 1 ) after excluding the point sources , we checked that the statistical distribution of the skymap pixels significances is a gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 ; 2 ) we checked that spectra extracted at random source - free positions did not present any feature , and were consistent with zero ; 3 ) we checked that the detected sources located near the tycho s snr did not present the same 65 - 80 kev excess in their spectra , nor any other peculiar feature . in particular , this last point allows us to exclude that the observed feature is a systematic effect related to the response matrix .",
    "the same data reduction and analysis was applied to the bat spectrum of the snr cas  a , which is a known source of @xmath3ti .",
    "the snr was within the bat fov for 44  ms , corresponding to an on - axis equivalent exposure of 19.9  ms .",
    "the signal in the 60 - 85  kev range is detected with high significance ( @xmath013  @xmath1 ) .    also in this case , as expected , the fit with a simple power - law function is not acceptable ( @xmath21=68 for 5 d.o.f . ) , as it significantly underestimates the flux in the 60 - 85  kev bin .",
    "we therefore modelled the spectrum with a power - law function for the continuum , and two narrow gaussian features at the position of the @xmath3sc lines .",
    "this model provides a good description of the dataset ( @xmath21=5.4 for 4 d.o.f . ) , with best fit values @xmath18=3.32@xmath220.07 for the power - law photon index , @xmath27=(1.5@xmath220.3)@xmath610@xmath7  photons@xmath8s@xmath9at 1  kev for the power - law normalization , f@xmath26=(2.7@xmath220.6)@xmath610@xmath7  photons@xmath8s@xmath9 , and f@xmath25=(2.5@xmath220.6)@xmath610@xmath7  photons@xmath8s@xmath9   for the fluxes of the two lines .",
    "the derived fluxes are in excellent agreement with previous measurements from beppo - sax @xcite , and integral @xcite , and slightly higher than the value measured by _ nustar _",
    "@xcite . the observed x - ray emission from @xmath3sc",
    "is indeed expected to decay with time .",
    "as our data span a period of @xmath29 years prior to the _ nustar _ observations , the expected decrease in the line flux is @xmath1710% , and can partially account for the observed difference .",
    "another possibility is that a small fraction of the observed flux comes from a spatially diffuse component of emission , which was not imaged by _",
    "[ sec : result ] the most notable feature of the bat observations is the detection of emission in the 6085  kev range . the snr spectrum is well described by a simple synchrotron model , which also provides the best description of the broadband ( from radio to hard x - rays ) emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the discovery of gamma - ray line emission at 1.157  mev from the @xmath3ti-@xmath3sc-@xmath3ca decay chain in cas  a @xcite was a benchmark observation for the field of astronomy with radioactivities ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) , as it established the production and ejection of @xmath3ti from core collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) .",
    "the only other evidence for @xmath3ti production came from the late time light curve of sn  1987a in the lmc , where modeling of the various contributions to power from radioactive decays indicated a @xmath3ti mass of 02 - 2.0  @xmath610@xmath10  m@xmath11  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "monte carlo simulations of the distribution of supernovae in the milky way @xcite indicated that the absence of additional @xmath3ti sources is indeed statistically unlikely .",
    "@xcite concluded that either the milky way has experienced an unusually low core - collapse sn rate in the past few centuries , or that @xmath3ti producing supernovae are rare , atypical events .",
    "the bat detection of @xmath3ti in tycho s supernova ( type ia ) would represent the third astrophysical site for which @xmath3ti synthesis ( and ejection into the ism ) has been established , indicating that both core collapse supernovae and thermonuclear ( single degenerate ) supernovae contribute to the galactic chemical evolution of @xmath3ca .",
    "we now have two identified @xmath3ti sources in the galaxy ( a ccsn remnant , cas a , and a type ia remnant , tycho ) and one ccsn source in the lmc ( sn 1987a ) , but this has not resolved the open question of the main source of @xmath3ca in galactic chemical evolution .",
    "the yields of the three sources discussed here are surprisingly similar , higher than the predictions of standard sn models , and at a level that led to the expected multi - spot sky simulated by @xcite .",
    "we are therefore still missing the key to understanding the origin of @xmath3ca ."
