    "in late 1990 s , berry and robbins @xcite , motivated by certain problems in quantum physics , asked an interesting geometric question which can be reformulated as follows : given a positive integer @xmath0 , is there a continuous map which to any @xmath0 pairwise distinct points @xmath7 in @xmath2 assigns @xmath0 points @xmath8 in the complex projective space @xmath9 in such a way that    * the points @xmath10 are not contained in a linear subspace ; * @xmath11 for any @xmath12 and any permutation @xmath13 of @xmath14 ?",
    "the question has been answered in the positive by atiyah in @xcite . in the same work atiyah",
    "observed that a more elegant ( and more desirable ) solution could be given if a certain determinant assigned to any @xmath0 distinct points in @xmath2 does not vanish .",
    "this determinant has been refined in @xcite , where some numerical evidence supporting its conjectural non - vanishing is given .",
    "further refinements and generalizations of the conjecture together with compelling numerical evidence were presented by atiyah and sutcliffe in @xcite . in that paper",
    "the authors construct a determinant function with remarkable properties , which assigns to any @xmath0 distinct points @xmath1 in @xmath2 a complex number @xmath3 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* formula ( 3.9 ) ) ) .",
    "let us briefly outline the construction of @xmath15 . denote by @xmath16 the coordinates of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "for each pair @xmath19 choose two complex numbers @xmath20 and @xmath21 such that @xmath22 and    @xmath23    with the convention that @xmath24 when the denominator of the right hand side of ( [ det ] ) vanishes .",
    "when @xmath25 , define @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "define @xmath28 as the coefficient at @xmath29 of the polynomial @xmath30 .",
    "the atiyah determinant @xmath3 is defined as the determinant of the matrix @xmath31 . in @xcite",
    "it has been proved that @xmath3 is independent of all the choices made in the course of its definition . moreover , this determinant is invariant under the orientation preserving similitudes of @xmath2 and becomes its own conjugate under the orientation reversing similitudes . in @xcite",
    "the authors stated the following three conjectures about @xmath3 .",
    "[ conj1 ] @xmath32 for all @xmath1 .",

    "a compelling numerical evidence is given in support of all three conjectures .",
    "in addition , the authors provide a very interesting physical interpretation of atiyah determinant and discuss further generalization of the conjectures .",
    "conjecture  [ conj1 ] has been proved for @xmath36 by eastwood and norbury @xcite .",
    "in addition , conjecture  [ conj1 ] has been proved for some configurations of points of arbitrarily large size in @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of any other results concerning these conjectures .",
    "in the first part of our paper we obtain an explicit formula for the value @xmath37 of atiyah determinant at vertices of any regular @xmath0-gon ( see theorem  [ formul ] ) . using this formula we prove in theorem  [ asymp ] that @xmath38 and confirm conjecture  [ conj2 ] in this case .",

    ", we investigate atiyah determinant when @xmath36 . in theorem  [ convex ]",
    "we prove conjecture  [ conj2 ] for vertices of any convex quadrilateral , and in theorem  [ inscribed ] we confirm conjecture  [ conj3 ] for inscribed quadrilaterals .",
    "in the course of proving these results , we are led to some intriguing results and conjectures about tetrahedra and quadrilaterals for which we have compelling numerical evidence ( see conjectures  [ conj4 ] ,  [ conj5 ] , and  [ conj6 ] ) .",
    "suppose that the points @xmath39 are on a circle .",

    "then @xmath50    it follows easily from the last formula that conjecture  [ conj1 ] for the points @xmath1 is equivalent to @xmath51-linear independence of the polynomials @xmath52 , @xmath45 . indeed , by ( [ poly4 ] ) , the @xmath51-linear independence of these polynomials is equivalent to the @xmath51-linear independence of the polynomials @xmath53 , @xmath45 .",
    "in turn , the @xmath51-linear independence of the latter sequence of polynomials is , by definition , equivalent to the non - vanishing of the determinant @xmath3 .",

    "it follows that this polynomial is @xmath85 , i.e. @xmath86 .",

    "we do not know any explicit formulas expressing the angles of the associated crelle triangle in terms of the angles @xmath169 in general .",
