    "living cells can sense changes in their environment with extraordinary precision . receptors in our visual system can detect single photons @xcite , some animals can smell single molecules @xcite , swimming bacteria can respond to the binding and unbinding of only a limited number of molecules @xcite , and eukaryotic cells can respond to a difference in @xmath0 molecules between the front and the back of the cell @xcite .",
    "recent experiments suggest that the precision of the embryonic development of the fruitfly _ drosophila _ is close to the limit set by the available number of regulatory proteins @xcite .",
    "this raises the question what is the fundamental limit to the precision of chemical concentration measurements .    living cells",
    "measure chemical concentrations via receptor proteins , which can either be at the cell surface or inside the cell .",
    "these measurements are inevitably corrupted by two sources of noise .",
    "one is the stochastic transport of the ligand molecules to the receptor via diffusion ; the other is the binding of the ligand molecules to the receptor after they have arrived at its surface .",
    "berg and purcell pointed out in the seventies that cells can reduce the sensing error by increasing the number of measurements , and that they can do so in two principal ways @xcite .",
    "the first is to simply increase the number of receptors .",
    "the other is to increase the number of measurements per receptor . in the latter scenario ,",
    "the cell infers the ligand concentration not from the instantaneous ligand - binding state of the receptor , but rather from its average over some integration time @xmath1 .",
    "this time integration has to be performed by the signaling network downstream of the receptor proteins .    in recent years",
    ", tremendous progress has been made in understanding how accurately cells can measure chemical concentrations @xcite .",
    "most of these studies assume that the cell estimates the concentration via the mechanism of time integration as envisioned by berg and purcell @xcite , although mora , endres , wingreen and others have shown that under certain conditions a better estimate of the concentration can be obtained via maximum likelihood estimation @xcite . in this review",
    ", we will limit ourselves to sensing static concentrations , which do not change on the timescale of the response , and we will focus on the mechanism of time integration , although we will also briefly discuss the scheme of maximum likelihood estimation . this review will follow a series of papers written by the authors , but , in doing so , will also discuss other relevant papers .",
    "specifically , in this review we will address the following questions : if the downstream signaling network integrates the state of the receptor over some given integration time @xmath1 , what is then the sensing error ?",
    "this is the question that was first addressed by berg and purcell @xcite , and later followed up by many authors @xcite .",
    "the answer depends on the correlation time of the receptor , which is determined by the stochastic arrival of the ligand molecules at the receptor by diffusion and on the stochastic binding of the ligand molecules to the receptor .",
    "recently , the correct expression for the correlation time and hence the sensing error has become the subject of debate @xcite , which we will review in section [ sec : bp ] .",
    "the next question is : how do signaling networks integrate the receptor state ?",
    "do they integrate it uniformly in time , as assumed by berg and purcell ? if not , can cellular sensing systems then actually reach the sensing limit of berg and purcell ? as we will see , signaling networks can not only reach the berg - purcell limit , but , in some cases , even beat it by 12% @xcite .    importantly , the signaling network downstream of the receptor is stochastic in nature , which means that while the network is removing the extrinsic noise in the receptor signal , it will also add its own intrinsic noise to the transmitted signal .",
    "most studies have ignored this intrinsic noise in the signaling network , essentially assuming that it can be made arbitrarily small @xcite .",
    "however , can signaling networks remove the extrinsic noise in the input signal and simultaneously suppress the intrinsic noise of the signaling network @xcite ?",
    "if so , what resources  receptors , time , readout molecules , energy  are required ?",
    "do these resources fundamentally limit sensing , like weak links in a chain ? or can they compensate each other , leading to trade - offs between them ? we will see that equilibrium networks , which are not driven out of thermodynamic equilibrium , can sense  energy dissipation is not essential for sensing @xcite",
    ". however , their sensing accuracy is limited by the number of receptors ; adding a downstream network can never improve the precision of sensing .",
    "this is because equilibrium sensing systems face a fundamental trade - off between the removal of extrinsic and intrinsic noise @xcite .",
    "only non - equilibrium systems can lift this trade - off : they can integrate the receptor state over time while suppressing the intrinsic noise by using energy to store the receptor state into stable chemical modification states of the readout molecules @xcite .",
    "storing the state of the bound receptor over time using a canonical push - pull signaling network requires at least one readout molecule to store the state and at least @xmath2 of energy to store it reliably @xcite .",
    "non - equilibrium systems thus require three resource classes that are fundamentally required for sensing  receptors and their integration time , readout molecules , and energy .",
    "each resource class sets a fundamental sensing limit , which means that the sensing precision is bounded by the limiting resource class and can not be enhanced by increasing another class .",
    "last but not least , we will address the question of whether cellular sensing involves computations that can be understood using ideas from the thermodynamics of computation @xcite .",
    "cells seem to copy the ligand - binding state of the receptor into chemical modification states of downstream readout molecules @xcite , but can this process be rigorously mapped onto computational protocols typically considered in the computational literature @xcite ?",
    "if so , how do these cellular copy protocols compare to thermodynamically optimal protocols ?",
    "can they reach the landauer bound , which states that the fundamental limit on the energetic cost of an irreversible computation is @xmath3 per bit ?",
    "we will see that cellular copy operations differ fundamentally in their design from thermodynamically optimal protocols , and that as a result they can never reach the landauer limit , regardless of parameters @xcite .",
    "berg and purcell and subsequent authors @xcite considered the scenario in which the cell estimates the ligand concentration @xmath4 , assumed to be constant on the timescale of the response , by monitoring the occupancy of the receptor to which the ligand molecules bind and unbind .",
    "the key idea is that the cell infers the concentration by estimating the true average receptor occupancy @xmath5 from the average occupancy @xmath6 over some integration time @xmath1 , and by inverting the input - output relation @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "a central result is that for a single receptor .",
    "the time average of its occupancy @xmath8 over the integration time @xmath1 is @xmath9 . using error propagation , the fractional error in the estimate of the concentration , @xmath10 ,",
    "is then given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the variance in the time - averaged occupancy @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the gain , which determines how the error in the estimate of @xmath5 propagates to that in the estimate of @xmath4 .",
    "the gain can be obtained from the input - output relation @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the receptor - ligand binding affinity : @xmath17 . in the limit that the integration time @xmath1 is much longer than the receptor correlation time @xmath18 , the variance in the estimate @xmath13 of the true mean occupancy @xmath5 is @xmath19}}}{t},{\\label{eqn : sigma_nt}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the instantaneous variance @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the probability that the receptor is ligand bound , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively the power spectrum and the laplace transform of the correlation function @xmath24 of @xmath8 .",
    "the above expression shows that the variance in the average @xmath13 is given by the instantaneous variance @xmath25 divided by @xmath26 , which can be interpreted as the number of independent measurements of @xmath8 .",
    "inserting eq .",
    "[ eqn : sigma_nt ] into eq .",
    "[ eqn : error ] yields @xmath27 this is indeed the sensing error based on @xmath28 independent concentration measurements .",
    "[ eqn : error2 ] holds for any single receptor , be it a promoter on the dna , a receptor on the cell membrane , or a receptor protein freely diffusing inside the cytoplasm @xcite .",
    "all we need to do to get the sensing error , is to find the receptor correlation time @xmath18 , which depends on the scenario by which the ligand finds the receptor .      to obtain the receptor correlation time @xmath18 ,",
    "berg and purcell assumed that the ligand binds the receptor in a markovian fashion , which means that @xmath18 is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the ligand - receptor binding rate and @xmath31 is the unbinding rate .",
    "berg and purcell described the binding site as a circular patch on the membrane , with patch radius @xmath32 . to get the forward rate @xmath30",
    ", they assumed @xmath30 is given by the diffusion - limited binding rate @xmath33 , but with the cross section @xmath32 renormalized by the sticking probability .",
    "for the binding of a ligand to a membrane patch , @xmath34 .",
    "we will consider the binding of ligand to a spherical receptor protein with ligand - receptor cross section @xmath35 , in which case @xmath36 . to get the backward rate @xmath31 , berg and purcell exploited the detailed - balance condition @xmath37 , which states that in steady state the net rate of binding equals the net rate of unbinding .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "[ eqn : error2 ]  and  [ eqn : bptau_n ] yields the following expression of berg and purcell for the sensing error @xmath38 this expression can be understood intuitively : the factor @xmath39 is the rate at which ligand molecules arrive at the receptor , @xmath40 is the probability that the receptor is free , and hence @xmath41 is the count rate at which the receptor binds the ligand molecules ; @xmath41 multiplied with @xmath1 is thus the total number of counts in the integration time @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , this expression states that the fractional error @xmath10 decreases with the square root of the number of counts , as we would expect intuitively .",
    "while this expression makes sense intuitively , there are two problems .",
    "first , receptor - ligand binding is , in general , not markovian . to illustrate this ,",
    "imagine for the sake of the argument that a ligand - bound receptor is surrounded by a uniform , equilibrium distribution of ligand molecules .",
    "if the receptor - bound ligand dissociates , then the other ligand molecules will still have the equilibrium distribution . if it rebinds and then dissociates again , the other ligand molecules will again still have the equilibrium distribution .",
    "the problem arises when a ) the rebinding of the dissociated ligand molecule is pre - empted by the binding of another ligand molecule ; _ and _ b ) if this second molecule dissociates from the receptor before the first has diffused into the bulk .",
    "if this happens , then the receptor and the dissociated ligand molecule at contact are no longer surrounded by a uniform equilibrium distribution of ligand molecules .",
    "indeed , the process of binding generates non - trivial spatio - temporal correlations between the positions of the ligand molecules , which depend on the history of the association and dissociation events .",
    "this turns an association - dissociation reaction into a complicated non - markovian , many - body problem , which can , in general , not be solved analytically .",
    "the second problem of the analysis of berg and purcell is that not all ligand - receptor association reactions are diffusion limited .",
    "berg and purcell were fully aware of this , but they argued on p. 208 of ref .",
    "@xcite that if the ligand ",
    "_ does nt stick on its first contact , it may very soon bump into the site again  and again .",
    "if these encounters occur with a time interval short compared to @xmath42 [ the time a ligand is bound ] , their result is equivalent merely to a larger value of @xmath43 [ the sticking probability ] . as we have no independent definition of the patch radius @xmath32",
    ", we may as well absorb the effective @xmath43 into @xmath32 .  _ this argument , however , does not take into account that when a ligand arrives at the receptor for the first time and does not stick immediately , it may also return to the bulk , after which another ligand molecule may bind . moreover , a ligand molecule that has just dissociated from the receptor may either rapidly rebind the receptor , or diffuse away from it into the bulk .",
    "it thus remained unclear how accurate the expression of berg and purcell , eq .",
    "[ eqn : bperror ] , is .",
    "bialek and setayesghar sought to generalize the result of berg and purcell by explicitly taking into account the receptor - ligand binding dynamics @xcite .",
    "they considered a model in which the ligand molecules can diffuse , bind the receptor upon contact with an intrinsic association rate @xmath44 , and unbind from the receptor with an intrinsic dissociation rate @xmath45 .",
    "this model is described by the following reaction - diffusion equations @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the concentration of ligand at position @xmath48 at time @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the position of the receptor . to solve these equations ,",
    "bialek and setayesghar invoked the fluctuation - dissipation relation , leading to a linearization of eqs .",
    "[ eqn : bsrd1 ]  and  [ eqn : bsrd2 ] .    the resulting expression for the sensing error is @xmath51 the first term describes the contribution to the sensing error from the stochastic transport of the ligand molecules to the receptor by diffusion .",
    "the second term describes the contribution from the intrinsic stochasticity of the binding kinetics of the receptor : even in the limit that @xmath52 , such that the ligand concentration is uniform in space at all times , the ligand concentration can still not be measured with infinite precision because the receptor stochastically switches between the bound and unbound states , leading to noise in the estimate of the receptor occupancy .",
    "this term is absent in eq .",
    "[ eqn : bperror ] since berg and purcell assume that the binding reaction is fully diffusion limited , meaning that the intrinsic rates @xmath44 and @xmath45 go to infinity . indeed ,",
    "for fast , diffusion - limited reactions , this term can be much smaller than the first one .",
    "the rate @xmath44 is the rate of ligand - receptor binding , given that receptor and ligand are in contact .",
    "its maximum rate is given by transition - state theory , which yields the rate @xmath53 in the absence of any recrossings of the dividing surface that separates the bound from the unbound state @xcite .",

    "for diffusion - limited reactions , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , which is typically much larger than the diffusion - limited rate @xmath61 .    more generally , the first term on the right - hand side eq .",
    "[ eqn : bserror ] presents a noise floor that is solely due to the stochastic transport of the ligand to the receptor by diffusion , independent of the binding kinetics of the ligand after it has arrived at the receptor . the first term is thus considered to be the fundamenetal sensing limit set by the physics of diffusion @xcite , and it can be compared with the expression of berg and purcell , eq .  [ eqn : bperror ] .",
    "it is clear that the expression of bialek and setayesghar and that of berg and purcell differ by a factor @xmath62 .",
    "this difference can have marked implications .",
    "although the bialek - setayeshgar expression predicts that the uncertainty due to diffusion remains bounded even in the limit that @xmath63 , the berg - purcell expression suggests that it diverges in this limit .",
    "intuitively , we expect a dependence on @xmath64 , because a higher receptor occupancy at fixed @xmath33 should reduce the count rate .      to elucidate the discrepancy between eqs .",
    "[ eqn : bperror ]  and  [ eqn : bserror ] , kaizu and coworkers rederived the expression for the sensing error @xcite .",

    "the question remains why the analysis of kaizu _ et al .",

    "the central assumption of eq .",
    "[ eqn : surv_2 ] makes the propensity for binding the next ligand independent of the history of the previous binding events .",
    "in essence , it reduces the non - markovian many - body problem to a markovian two - body problem , which can be seen from the expression for the receptor correlation time @xmath98 : @xmath99 here @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the renormalized association and dissociation rates @xmath102 with @xmath103 the equilibrium constant and @xmath104 the diffusion - limited rate constant@xmath105 for @xmath106 .",

    "what is the role of rebindings ?",
    "do they not generate an algebraic tail in the correlation function ? as it turns out , these questions are intimately related .",
    "it is well known that in an unbounded system , the correlation function exhibits an algebraic tail because at long times the relaxation of the receptor state is dominated by the slow diffusive transport of the ligand over long distances @xcite . however , we typically expect the space to be bounded , both for the binding of ligand to a receptor inside the cell and to a receptor at the cell surface .",
    "indeed , the simulations of @xcite were performed in a finite box of cellular dimensions , yielding exponential , not algebraic , decay at long times .",

    "b ) if this second particle dissociates from the receptor before the first has equilibrated by diffusing into the bulk .",
    "however , the time a ligand molecule spends near the receptor is typically much shorter than the time for molecules to arrive from the bulk at biologically relevant concentrations , which means that the probability of rebinding interference is very small , and condition a ) is not met . because biologically relevant concentrations are low , also the dissociation rates are typically low , which means that also condition b ) is not met .",
    "the likelihood that both conditions are met , necessary for the analysis to break down , is thus very small @xcite .",
    "because rebindings are so much faster than bulk arrivals , they can be integrated out @xcite .",
    "the probability that a particle that has just dissociated from the receptor will rebind the receptor rather than diffuse away into the bulk is @xmath108 .",
    "the mean number of rounds of rebinding and dissociation before the molecules diffuse into the bulk is then @xmath109 , which rescales the effective dissociation rate : @xmath110 .",
    "similarly , a molecule that arrives at the receptor from the bulk may either bind the receptor or escape back into the bulk with probability @xmath111 ; the mean number of rounds of escape and arrival before binding is @xmath112 , which rescales the effective association rate @xmath113 .",
    "these are indeed precisely the rates of eqs .",
    "[ eqn : kon ]  and  [ eqn : koff ] .",
    "this analysis also elucidates the role of rebinding in sensing .",
    "the probability of rebinding does not depend on the concentration , and rebindings therefore do not provide information on the concentration .",
    "they merely increase the receptor correlation time by increasing the effective receptor on - time from @xmath114 to @xmath115 .",
    "after @xmath116 rounds of dissociation and rebinding , the molecule escapes into the bulk , and then another molecule will arrive at the receptor with rate @xmath117 ; this molecule may return to the bulk or bind the receptor , such that a new molecule will bind after a time @xmath118 on average .",
    "importantly , this molecule will bind in a memoryless fashion and with a rate that depends on the concentration .",
    "this binding event thus provides an independent concentration measurement .",
    "the mean waiting time in between independent binding events is therefore @xmath119 , which allows us to rewrite eq .",
    "[ eqn : final ] in a form that we would expect intuitively : @xmath120 indeed , the sensing error @xmath10 decreases with the square root of the number of independent measurements @xmath121 during the integration time @xmath1 .",
    "lastly , why does the expression of bialek and setayesghar , eq .",
    "[ eqn : bserror ] , miss the factor @xmath40 in the diffusion term ?",
    "we believe that this is because by invoking the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , bialek and setayesghar effectively linearize the reaction - diffusion problem , thereby ignoring correlations between the state of the receptor and the local ligand concentration .",
    "this idea is supported by the analysis of berezhkovskii and szabo @xcite , who recently derived an expression for the accuracy of sensing via multiple receptors on a sphere , ignoring spatio - temporal correlations between the states of the respective receptor molecules and the ligand concentration .",
    "interestingly , in the limit that the number of receptors on the sphere goes to infinity , then , by replacing the radius of the cell with the cross section of the receptor , their expression becomes identical to that of bialek and setayesghar , see also eq .",
    "[ eqn : bp_d ] below ; indeed , this expression does not contain the factor @xmath122 .",
    "this can be understood by noting that in the limit that the number of receptors becomes large , there will always be receptor molecules available for binding the ligand .",
    "but for a single receptor , we have to take the binary character of the receptor state into account .",
    "the work of berg and purcell and subsequent studies like those discussed above @xcite assume not only a given integration time @xmath1 , but also that the downstream signaling network averages the state of the receptor _ uniformly _ in time over this integration time @xmath1 .",
    "it remained unclear , however , how the signaling network determines the ( effective ) integration time @xmath1 , whether the network averages the signal uniformly in time , and how this assumption affects the sensing precision @xcite .",

    "@xcite considered linear , but otherwise arbitrary signaling network . for deterministic networks of this type , the output @xmath123 at time @xmath124 can be written as @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the response function of the network and @xmath127 is the stochastic receptor signal . to compare to previous results",

    "moreover , they assumed that either : ( 1 ) @xmath129 for @xmath130 , which corresponds to a scenario where the response time @xmath131 of the network is shorter than @xmath124 , or , equivalently , the network reaches steady state by the time @xmath124 ; or ( 2 ) @xmath132 for @xmath130 , which corresponds to a scenario in which the cell is initially in a basal state . in both cases , @xmath133 . when neither @xmath134 nor @xmath127 are zero for @xmath130 , then previous states of the environment influence the state of the network at @xmath124 , which can either be a source of noise , or a source of information if the environments are correlated .",
    "the idea is that the cell infers the ligand concentration from the output @xmath135 and by inverting the input - output relation @xmath136 . using error propagation",

    "@xcite then studied different signaling architectures , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] . clearly , these networks do not , in general , average the receptor signal uniformly in time ; instead , they have non - uniform weighting functions ( fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2]a , c , e , g ) .",
    "they weigh receptor signals in the past with a response function that depends on both the lifetime of the signaling molecules and on the topology of the signaling network .",
    "one - layer networks consisting of a single reversible reaction give most weight to the most recent signal value ( left - most column ) , while multi - level cascades consisting of irreversible reactions give more weight to signal values more in the distant past ( second column ) .",
    "this concept can be generalized to arbitrarily large signaling networks .",
    "reversible _ cascades have weighting functions that peak at some finite time in the past , balancing the down - weighting of the signal from the distant past due to the reverse reactions , with the down - weighting of the signal from the recent past resulting from the multilevel character of the network .",
    "linear combinations of the weighting functions for reversible and irreversible cascades can be achieved with multiple cascades that are activated by the input in parallel and which independently activate the same effector molecule .",
    "clearly , signaling networks allow for very diverse weighting functions .",
    "this idea can be exploited to improve the accuracy of sensing , as shown in the right two columns of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "a network with a feedforward topology that combines a fast reversible cascade with a slow irreversible cascade can not only reach the berg - purcell limit , but even beat it by @xmath138 , when the observation time @xmath124 is on the order of the receptor correlation time @xmath18 .",

    "thermodynamically optimal protocols increase the driving force slowly , such that the memory is slowly driven to its new state . in contrast , in cellular systems the thermodynamic driving force for the reactions that implement the copy process is typically constant , because the fuel molecules that drive these reactions are commonly present at constant concentration @xcite . as a result , cellular systems face a trade - off between cost and precision that is both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct from that required thermodynamically , regardless of parameters @xcite .",
    "they dissipate more to achieve the same accuracy .",
    "one of the most vivid manifestations of this difference concerns the landauer limit itself .",
    "one of the surprising , but by now well - known , results of bennett and landauer was that quasi - static protocols make it possible to perform repeated copies with 100% accuracy at only a finite energy cost of , indeed , @xmath281 per copy .",
    "in contrast , cellular copy protocols can only reach 100% accuracy when the cost diverges .",
    "for the purpose of sampling a noisy signal , however , perfect copies are not necessarily ideal . indeed , as we have seen in section [ sec : neq_res ] , the energetically most efficient approach to record the receptor state is to take many noisy samples , which together make up one effective sample . for the canonical push - pull network considered here the minimal cost",
    "to take one effective receptor sample is @xmath282 on average if the receptor occupancy is @xmath283 @xcite . for a bi - functional kinase system ,",
    "in which the kinase associated with the receptor catalyzes the phosphorylation of the readout when the receptor is bound to ligand , but dephosphorylation when the receptor is not bound to ligand , this minimal cost is even lower : @xmath284 @xcite .",
    "information processing devices require resources to be built and run .",
    "components are needed to construct the system , space is required to accommodate the components and energy is required to make the components and operate the system .",
    "these resources constrain the design and performance of any device , and cellular sensing systems are no exception .",
    "making proteins is costly @xcite .",
    "they also take up valuable space : both the membrane and the cytoplasm are highly crowded , with proteins occupying 2575% of the membrane area @xcite and 2030% of the cytoplasmic volume @xcite . and",
    "many cellular signaling pathways , including two - component systems in bacteria @xcite , gtp - ase cycles as in the ras system @xcite , phosphorylation cycles as in mapk cascades @xcite , are driven out of thermal equilibrium via the turnover of fuel .",
    "also the adaptation system that allows _",
    "e. coli _ to adapt to a wide range of background concentrations is driven out of equilibrium @xcite .",
    "however , cells also commonly employ equilibrium motifs , such as protein binding and sequestration .",
    "indeed , as we have seen , sensing does not fundamentally require energy input @xcite .",
    "equilibrium sensing systems can respond to changes in the environment by harvesting the energy of ligand binding , thereby capitalizing on the work that is performed by the environment to change the ligand concentration .",
    "also adaptation does not fundamentally require energy consumption @xcite .",
    "cells face a fundamental trade - off between two modes of sensing , an equilibrium mode based on binding and sequestration and a non - equilibrium mode based on catalysis .",
    "these sensing strategies have different resource requirements . ]",
    "when does the non - equilibrium sensing strategy outperform the equilibrium one ?",
    "this depends on the resources available to the cell , as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : tradeoff ] . comparing the bound for non - equilibrium systems , eq .",
    "[ eqn : error_min ] , with that for equilibrium ones without cooperative binding , @xmath285 , predicts that non - equilibrium systems can sense more accurately when there is at least one readout molecule available per receptor , and the amount of energy dissipated per receptor during the integration time is at least @xmath286 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , evolution may have toggled between equilibrium and non - equilibrium sensing strategies .",
    "bacteria employ both one- and two - component signaling networks .",
    "one - component systems follow the equilibrium strategy , consisting of adaptor proteins which can bind an upstream ligand and a downstream effector .",
    "two - component systems are similar to the non - equilibrium push - pull system considered here , consisting of a kinase ( receptor ) and its substrate .",
    "intriguingly , some adaptor proteins , like rocr , contain the same - ligand binding domain as the kinase and the same effector - binding domain as the substrate of a two - component system , i.e. ntrb - ntrc @xcite .",
    "they could thus transmit the same signal .",
    "our results suggest that these are alternative signaling strategies , selected because of different resource selection pressures .",
    "it is tempting to believe that when sensing precision is important , but space for receptors on the membrane is limiting , non - equilibrium sensing becomes essential , because it makes it possible to take more concentration measurements per receptor .",
    "in this review we have focused on sensing concentrations that do not vary on the timescale of the response of the system .",
    "while some questions remain open , such as the importance of spatio - temporal correlations in both ligand - receptor and receptor - readout binding , this problem is by now fairly well understood .",
    "we understand how the receptor correlation time depends on the diffusion and binding kinetics of the ligand ( although the question of the correlation time of multiple receptors is , arguably , still open ) , how the effective integration time depends on the lifetime of the readout molecules and the architecture of the readout network , and how the precision of sensing depends on the number of receptors , the number of readout molecules , the receptor correlation time , the integration time , and energy .",
    "we understand how combinations of resources impose fundamental sensing limits and what this implies for the optimal design of cellular sensing systems",
    ".    the challenge will be to make a similar leap for systems that do not respond rapidly on the timescale of variations in the input signal . for these systems",
    ", we have to take the dynamics of the input signal into account . on this front",
    ", progress has been made in recent years .",
    "we are now beginning to understand how in these systems information transmission depends on the lifetime of the readout molecules and on the topology of the readout network @xcite , and what the trade - off between energy dissipation and information processing is @xcite . yet , many questions are still wide open : what is the performance measure that best descibres the design logic of cellular sensing systems ?",
    "is it the average sensing error , the instantaneous mutual information , the information transmission rate @xcite , or the learning rate @xcite ?",
    "what resource combinations impose fundamental sensing limits ?",
    "also new questions arise : how accurately can living cells predict the future input signal @xcite ?",
    "and what are the thermodynamic costs of cellular prediction @xcite ?",
    "the physics of sensing will remain a fascinating problem for many years to come .",

    "<S> we describe why this mechanism of time integration requires three classes of resources  receptors and their integration time , readout molecules , energy  and how each resource class sets a fundamental sensing limit . </S>",
    "<S> we also briefly discuss the scheme of maximum - likelihood estimation , the role of receptor cooperativity , and how cellular copy protocols differ from canonical copy protocols typically considered in the computational literature , explaining why cellular sensing systems can never reach the landauer limit on the optimal trade - off between accuracy and energetic cost . </S>"
