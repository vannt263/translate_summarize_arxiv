    "the broadband emission from a pwn is determined by the power and spectrum of particles injected by the pulsar , as well as the environment into which the pwn expands .",
    "the input luminosity is e.g. pacini & salvati 1973 ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the initial spin - down time scale of the pulsar .",
    "here @xmath7 is the initial spin - down power , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the initial spin period and its time derivative , and @xmath10 is the so - called `` braking index '' of the pulsar ( @xmath11 for magnetic dipole spin - down ) .",
    "the pulsar has roughly constant energy output until a time @xmath12 , beyond which the output declines fairly rapidly with time .",
    "based on studies of the crab nebula , there appear to to be two electron populations - one corresponding to relic radio - emitting electrons that may have been injected early in the evolution of the supernova , and one associated with electrons injected directly by the pulsar wind ( atoyan & aharonian 1996 ) .",
    "these are often parameterized as a broken power law : @xmath13 with @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 for @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 represents the energy of a spectral break due to the two distinct populations .",
    "the integrated energy in the electron spectrum is then @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the ratio of the spin - down power injected in the form of poynting flux to that in the form of particles .",
    "the electrons injected into the pwn produce synchrotron radiation in the nebular magnetic field , as well as inverse - compton ( ic ) emission by upscattering photons from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , ambient starlight , and emission from nearby dust .",
    "the resulting emission spectrum is found by integrating the electron spectrum over the emissivity function for synchrotron and inverse - compton radiation ( e.g. lazendic et al .",
    "2004 ) using , respectively , the nebular magnetic field and spectral density of the ambient photon field . for electrons of energy @xmath21 ( in units of tev ) , the mean energy for synchrotron - emitted photons is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the magnetic field strength in units of @xmath24  g , while the average ic - scattered photon from the cmb has energy @xmath25 for a typical pwn power law particle spectrum , the ratio of the synchrotron and ic fluxes at these energies depends primarily on the magnetic field strength ( aharonian & atoyan 1999 ) : @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "the ratio of the peak @xmath28 values for the spectra , shown schematically in figure  2 , is thus an indicator of the magnetic field strength .    from the above",
    ", we see that for @xmath29 g , electrons that produce 1  tev photons from ic scattering of the cmb will produce 1  kev synchrotron photons . for lower magnetic fields ,",
    "the x - ray - emitting electrons are more energetic than the @xmath0-ray - emitting electrons .",
    "an important result is that for low magnetic fields and large ages , synchrotron losses can result in a cooling break in the electron spectrum that falls below the x - ray - emitting regime .",
    "the result is a pwn that has very little x - ray emission , but is bright in the vhe @xmath0-ray band .",
    "this is discussed further below .",
    "the evolution of the pwn spectrum is determined by balance of injection and losses , @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are timescales for radiative and escape losses , as well as the evolution of the magnetic field .",
    "venter & de jager ( 2006 ) parameterize the latter as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a characteristic timescale connected to the input history of the pulsar , and @xmath35 is a free parameter .    applying the above to the emission from a nebula of",
    "known age and spin - down power provides constraints on the initial pulsar spin period and magnetic field strength in the nebula , and has been used successfully in modeling emission from a number of systems including the crab nebula , the pwn associated with psr b1509@xmath3658 , and g0.9 + 0.1 ( venter & de jager 2006 ; zhang et al .",
    "it is important to note that this describes a spatially - averaged spectrum for the nebula , with no consideration given to variations of the magnetic field , for example .",
    "a more complete treatment of the nebula structure , in which the particles emerge from a termination shock in a the form of an axisymmetric particle and magnetic wind , which is allowed to evolve through radiative and adiabatic losses in order to determine the magnetic field distribution and electron spectrum , is required to address spatial and spectral variations observed in high resolution observations of pwne .",
    "recent work in this area has revolutionized our understanding of the inner structure of pwne ( e.g. lyubarsky 2002 , komissarov & lyubarsky 2004 ) , and extensions to include the associated emissivity have now produced both detailed emission maps and broadband spectral energy distributions based on these more encompassing models ( e.g. del zanna et al .",
    ", volpi et al ) .",
    "while most attempts to model the emission and evolution of pwne start with the assumption that a power law particle spectrum is injected into the nebula at the wind termination shock , there is evidence that the spectrum may be more complicated .",
    "low - frequency spectral breaks are observed in a number of pwne , including 3c 58 and g21.5 - 0.9 , for example .",
    "if interpreted as cooling breaks , these would require uncomfortably large magnetic fields ( green & scheuer 1992 ) .",
    "instead , it has been suggested that these are the result of either an episodic change in the pulsar input at an earlier epoch ( e.g. woljter et al .",
    "199x ) or an intrinsic feature in the injection spectrum ( frail 1998 ) .",
    "_ chandra _ observations of 3c 58 ( slane et al .",
    "2004 ) reveal an extended nebula filled with a complex of loop - like structures and surrounded by a shell of swept - up ejecta ( figure 3 ) . at the center",
    "is an energetic young pulsar accompanied by a jet and surrounded by a toroid that is also observed with _",
    "observations ( slane et al . 2008 ) .",
    "these observations , combined with data from other wavebands , show that the spectrum emerging from the wind termination shock in this system requires one or more spectral breaks ( figure  3 ) .",
    "such breaks will imprint themselves on the broadband spectra of pwne , causing the emission to deviate from that expected from a pure power law input , and potentially producing the low energy breaks observed for the large scale nebula , such as that seen in 3c  58 ( figure  3 ) .",
    "consideration must be given to such complexities in the injection spectrum to properly understand the evolution of the broadband spectrum .",
    "since a pulsar is formed in a supernova explosion , the star and its pwn are initially surrounded by the expanding ejecta and swept - up circumstellar material that comprise the associated snr . at early times",
    "the snr blast wave expands rapidly ( @xmath37 ) , while the pulsar itself moves at a slower ( but often significant ) speed ( with typical magnitude @xmath38 ) as the result of a `` kick '' due to asymmetries in the explosion . in the early phases of evolution",
    ", the pulsar is thus located very near the center of the snr .",
    "the energetic wind is injected into the snr interior , forming a high - pressure bubble that expands supersonically into the surrounding ejecta , forming a shock .",
    "the radius of the pwn evolves as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the energy released in the explosion and @xmath41 is the mass of the ejecta ( chevalier 1977 ) .",
    "thus , at least at early times when the pulsar input is high , the pwn expansion velocity increases with time .",
    "the sound speed in the relativistic fluid within the pwn is sufficiently high ( @xmath42 ) that any pressure variations experienced during the expansion are quickly balanced within the bubble ; at early stages , we thus expect the pulsar to be located at the center of the pwn .",
    "the pressure balance within the pwn results in a termination shock where the energetic pulsar wind meets the more slowly - expanding pwn .",
    "the outer blast wave of the snr , meanwhile , drives a shock into the surrounding interstellar / circumstellar medium ( ism / csm ) , forming a shell of hot gas and compressed magnetic field .",
    "as the shell sweeps up additional mass , and decelerates , a reverse shock ( rs ) propagates back into the expanding ejecta . as illustrated in figure 1 ,",
    "the entire system is thus described by four shocks : a forward shock that sweeps up the csm / ism ; a reverse that heats the supernova ejecta ( which is initially cold due to severe adiabatic losses from the rapid expansion ) ; a shock at the pwn / ejecta boundary , where the expanding nebula compresses and heats surrounding ejecta ; and the pulsar wind termination shock . at early times , the snr reverse shock expands outward , but more slowly than the forward shock , but eventually it moves inward . in the absence of a central pulsar or pwn , the reverse shock reaches the center of the snr in a time @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number density of ambient gas ( ( reynolds & chevalier 1984 ) .",
    "in the presence of a young pulsar , the reverse shock collides with the expanding pwn at a time @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the explosion energy in units of @xmath47  erg ( van der swaluw et al .",
    "this compresses the pwn until the pressure in the nebula is sufficiently high to rebound , and again expand into the ejecta .",
    "the system goes through several reverberations over the course of several tens of thousands of years .",
    "the crushing of the pwn results in an increase in the magnetic field .",
    "this causes a rapid burn - off of the most energetic particles in the nebula .",
    "the pwn / rs interface is rayleigh - taylor unstable , and is subject to the formation of filamentary structure where the dense ejecta material is mixed into the relativistic fluid ( blondin et al .",
    "the nebula subsequently re - forms as the pulsar injects fresh particles into its surroundings , but a significant relic nebula of mixed ejecta and relativistic gas will persist .    in cases where the pulsar and its pwn have moved considerably from the center of the pwn , or in which the snr has evolved in a medium of nonuniform density , the reverse shock will interact with the pwn asymmetrically , encountering one portion of the nebula well before another .",
    "this results in a complex interaction that leaves a highly distorted relic nebula that may be highly displaced from the pulsar position ( blondin et al .",
    "recent observations with the latest generation of vhe @xmath0-ray telescopes have uncovered a large number of sources that are , or appear to be , associated with pwne .",
    "as described above , the broadband spectra provide strong constraints on the structure and magnetic fields in these systems . coupled with information about their angular sizes , distances , and associations with any identified compact objects or supernova remnants",

    "the source has a radius of @xmath48  arcmin , and the spectrum is well - described by a power law with an index of @xmath49 the source is spatially coincident with g338.3@xmath360.0 , a shell - type snr with a diameter of @xmath50  arcmin ( figure 5 , top ) .",
    "the peak of the @xmath0-ray emission falls interior to the radio shell , suggesting that the emission may be from a pulsar - powered nebula associated with the snr , although no known pulsar resides in this vicinity .",
    "x - ray observations with _ xmm - newton _ ( funk et al .",
    "2007 ) reveal extended x - ray emission in the central regions of hess j1640 - 465 , suggestive of a pwn core .",
    "subsequent _ chandra _ observations ( lemiere et al .",
    "2008 ) reveal a compact object surrounded by a faint diffuse nebula ( figure 5 , top inset ) whose nonthermal x - ray spectrum shows clear evidence for steepening with radius , as expected if strong synchrotron losses have prevented energetic electrons from diffusing to large distances from the putative pulsar .",
    "hi absorption measurements ( lemiere et al . 2008 ) establish a distance of 8 - 13  kpc for g338.3@xmath360.0 , suggesting an age for the system of 10 - 30  kyr .",
    "based on the x - ray luminosity of @xmath51 for the x - ray nebula ( where @xmath52 is the distance in units of 10  kpc ) , a typical efficiency of @xmath53 for conversion of spin - down power to x - ray emission suggests @xmath54 for the putative pulsar . using the approach described in section 2",
    ", a leptonic model can adequately describe the x - ray and @xmath0-ray spectra , and predicts a system age of @xmath55  kyr with a mean magnetic field strength of @xmath56 g .",
    "the observed position and morphology of the x - ray nebula associated with hess j1640@xmath36465 is somewhat perplexing .",
    "it is not at the center of the snr shell , and the extended emission is not symmetric about the position of the putative pulsar .",
    "if born at the geometric center of g338.3@xmath360.0 , its current position indicates a projected space velocity of @xmath57 , which is not unreasonable for a pulsar .",
    "however , the asymmetric shape of the diffuse nebula makes such an explanation problematic . a more likely scenario may be that the pwn has already undergone disruption from the rs interaction . based on the distribution and kinematics of the molecular and neutral gas in this vicinity",
    ", it appears likely that the snr has evolved in a sufficiently complex environment to expect an asymmetric rs / pwn interaction ( lemiere et al . 2008 ) .",

    "the pulsar has a spin - down power @xmath60 and is surrounded by a faint x - ray nebula ( see figure 5 , bottom inset ) whose extended morphology , similar in orientation to that of hess j1825@xmath36137 but on a much smaller scale , suggests that the pwn has been disrupted by the snr reverse shock ( gaensler et al .",
    "this is consistent with the significant offset between the pulsar and the geometric center of hess j1825@xmath36137 .",
    "remarkably , the radius of hess j1825@xmath36137 is observed to decrease with increasing energy in the @xmath0-ray band , providing the first evidence in this band for the effects of synchrotron burn - off on the underlying electron spectrum .",
    "variations in the emission spectrum confirm a spectral steepening with radius , as expected from such losses .",

    "it appears clear that the system has evolved well past the reverse - shock crossing phase , and that the pwn has rebounded and continued to expand within its unseen host snr .",
    "the spectral steepening seen in the _",
    "_ data suggest that the radiative loss break has progressed to energies well below x - ray - emitting values , thus explaining the lack of x - ray emission from sites other than very near the pulsar , where fresh particle injection is taking place .",

    "the derived density of the thermal - emitting , ejecta - rich gas is @xmath64 , too low to accommodate hadronic scenarios for the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "a leptonic model consisting of a broken power law for the electrons in this region of the nebula is able to successfully reproduce the broadband emission as a combination of synchrotron radiation in the radio and x - ray bands , and inverse - compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background from the same electron population to produce the @xmath0-ray emission ( figure 8) .",
    "the best - fit model requires a magnetic field strength of @xmath65 g and an electron spectrum with two spectral breaks .",
    "the lower break is presumably intrinsic to the injected electron spectrum , or corresponds to a distinct population of radio - emitting particles injected early in the formation of the pwn , while the upper break is presumably associated with synchrotron cooling of the electrons .",
    "models with a single break are also possible , but violate either the observed radio flux or its spectral index ( lamassa et al .",
    "2008 )    our understanding of the low - energy electron spectrum in vela x is severely limited by the lack of observations at frequencies beyond about 30  ghz .",
    "it is unclear whether the spectrum has a break in this region , as suggested above , or continues to higher energies as a distinct population .",
    "however , electrons that would produce emission beyond the current radio frequency limits will also upscatter ambient photons into the energy sensitivity range of the _ fermi _ lat ( de jager et al .",
    "indeed , modeling shows that the three distinct photon populations ( the cmb , ambient starlight , and ir emission from ambient dust ) will produce discrete and resolvable features in the lat .",
    "future results from the ongoing lat sky survey thus promise to address key questions about the particle distribution in vela  x. this , combined with more extensive studies of the thermal and nonthermal x - ray emission will place strong constraints on the full evolution of vela  x , from the formation stage through the process of reverse - shock crushing of the pwn .",
