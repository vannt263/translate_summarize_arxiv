    "based on the data collected by the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the fermi gamma ray space telescope an excess of gamma rays has been found  @xcite .",
    "the excess photons , appearing in the energy spectrum of the gamma ray flux around 2 gev , originate from an extended volume centered on the galactic center ( gc ) and their source is still under scrutiny @xcite .",
    "the primary galactic diffuse emission components of gamma rays arise from the interaction of galactic cosmic rays with interstellar gas and radiation fields in the milky way .",
    "additional gamma ray components are believed to arise from individual point sources , isotropic gamma ray background and possibly extra galactic center sources such as dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "the fermi - lat collaboration recently released their analysis of data taken during the first 62 months of observation in the direction of the galactic center  @xcite . in their analysis four customized interstellar emission models ( iems ) and various point sources in different catalogs",

    ", the fermi fit indicated that the potential dark matter component strongly depends on iem assumptions .",
    "this dependence leads to an uncertainty that propagates into dark matter properties extracted from the gamma ray data .    to quantify the dependence of inferred dark matter properties on the iem assumptions , following the fermi - lat collaboration",
    ", we assume that dark matter annihilation is the source of the galactic center gamma ray excess .",
    "to endow dark matter particles with specific properties we use a straw man dark matter model . to make minimal and general theoretical assumptions we use the simplified model framework assuming that dark matter is a majorana fermion coupling to standard fermions via a scalar mediator",
    "this particular simplified model has unsuppressed indirect , and suppressed direct and collider detection rates , and emerged as the most plausible one when compared with a wide range of data @xcite . to show the role of the iem assumptions in constraining dark matter properties",
    ", we infer the properties of these dark matter particles using the multiple fermi data sets categorized by different choices of iems and spectral models .    to remain pragmatic , additionally to the galactic center data , we impose constraints on the dark matter model coming from dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies ( dsphs ) of the milky way .",
    "these dwarf galaxies are known to be dominated by dark matter .",
    "the fermi - lat collaboration recently set upper limits on the dark matter annihilation cross section from a combined analysis of 15 milky way dsphs  @xcite .",
    "these constraints are the most stringent for dark matter annihilating into quark or @xmath2 lepton channels , compared to constraints from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and ams-02  @xcite .",

    "majorana fermions recently emerged as the most plausible dark matter particle candidates in the simplified model context @xcite .",
    "motivated by this , we assume that dark matter consists of a single majorana fermion , which we denote by @xmath3 . additionally , motivated by the listed literature and the higgs portal , we assume that the interaction between the dark matter particle and standard fermions is mediated by a scalar particle @xmath4 @xcite .    following refs .",
    "@xcite , we describe the dark matter to mediator interaction by @xmath5 and set @xmath6 .",
    "this is a typical choice to reduce the dimensions of the theoretical parameter space by effectively absorbing @xmath7 into the couplings of the mediator to standard model fermions @xmath8 .",
    "the latter enters the lagrangian via @xmath9 we only assume couplings between @xmath4 and third generation fermions @xmath10 to remain consistent with minimal flavor violation  @xcite . our main motivation for the form of the interactions defined in eqs .",

    "these prefer a non - vanishing pulsar distribution near the galactic center and ob stars distributed mostly on the galactic disk  @xcite .",
    "the fermi - lat collaboration thus selected their iems based on extreme distributions , i.e. intensity - scaled pulsars , intensity - scaled ob - stars , index - scaled pulsars and index - scaled ob - stars .",
    "point source candidates were then combined with the above iems in the fermi - lat analysis . in order to account for the observed residuals , the fermi - lat collaboration included the nfw profile as the spatial template to model the additional gamma ray distribution from dark matter annihilation .",
