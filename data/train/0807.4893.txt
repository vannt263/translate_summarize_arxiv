    "it has been known for a long time that the pion vector form factor ( vff ) in the space - like region is very well described by a monopole ansatz of the type given by vector meson dominance ( vmd ) in terms of the rho meson .",
    "however , it has remained unclear whether there is a good reason for this from qcd or it is just a mere coincidence and , consequently , it is not known how to go about improving on this ansatz .    to begin our discussion ,",
    "let us define the form factor , @xmath0 , by the matrix element @xmath1 where @xmath2 , such that @xmath3 corresponds to space - like data .",
    "since the spectral function for the corresponding dispersive integral for @xmath4 starts at twice the pion mass , the form factor can be approximated by a taylor expansion in powers of the momentum for @xmath5 . at low momentum ,",
    "chiral perturbation theory is the best tool for organizing the pion interaction in a systematic expansion in powers of momenta and quark masses  @xcite . with every order in the expansion",
    ", there comes a new set of coupling constants , the so - called low - energy constants ( lecs ) , which encode all the qcd physics from higher energies .",
    "this means , in particular , that the coefficients in the taylor expansion can be expressed in terms of these lecs and powers of the quark masses .",
    "consequently , by learning about the low - energy expansion , one may indirectly extract important information about qcd .    in principle",
    ", the coefficients in the taylor expansion may be obtained by means of a polynomial fit to the experimental data in the space - like region   production experiments and , consequently , they necessarily correspond to values of the momentum above the @xmath6 cut , i.e. @xmath7 with @xmath8 . ] below @xmath9 .",
    "however , such a polynomial fit implies a tradeoff .",
    "although , in order to decrease the ( systematic ) error of the truncated taylor expansion , it is clearly better to go to a low - momentum region , this also downsizes the set of data points included in the fit which , in turn , increases the ( statistical ) error .",
    "in order to achieve a smaller statistical error one would have to include experimental data from higher energies , i.e. from @xmath10 . since this is not possible in a polynomial fit",
    ", the use of alternative mathematical descriptions may be a better strategy .",
    "one such description , which includes time - like data as well , is based on the use of the roy equations and omns dispersion relations .",
    "this is the avenue followed by @xcite , which has already produced interesting results on the scalar channel @xcite , and which can also be applied to the vector channel .",
    "other procedures have relied on conformal transformations for the joint analysis of both time - like and space - like data  @xcite , or subtracted omns relations  @xcite .",
    "further analyses may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    on the other hand , as already mentioned above , one may also consider an ansatz of the type @xmath11 even though the simplicity of the form of eq .",
    "( [ vmd ] ) is quite astonishing , it reproduces the space - like data rather well , even for a range of momentum of the order of a few gev , i.e. @xmath12 .",
    "if this fact is not merely a fluke , it could certainly be interesting to consider the form ( [ vmd ] ) as the first step in a systematic approximation , which would then allow improvement on this vmd ansatz .    in this article , we would like to point out that the previous vmd ansatz for the form factor ( [ vmd ] ) can be viewed as the first element in a sequence of pad approximants ( pas ) which can be constructed in a systematic way . by considering higher - order terms in the sequence ,",
    "one may be able to describe the space - like data with an increasing level of accuracy  .",
    "of course , whether this is actually the case and the sequence is a convergent one in the strict mathematical sense or , on the contrary , the sequence eventually diverges , remains to be seen .",
    "but the important difference with respect to the traditional vmd approach is that , as a pad sequence , the approximation is well - defined and can be systematically improved upon .    although polynomial fitting is more common , in general , rational approximants ( i.e. ratios of two polynomials ) are able to approximate the original function in a much broader range in momentum than a polynomial  @xcite",
    ". this will be the great advantage of the pads compared to other methods : they allow the inclusion of low and high energy information in a rather simple way which , furthermore , can in principle be systematically improved upon . in certain cases , like when the form factor obeys a dispersion relation given in terms of a positive definite spectral function ( i.e. becomes a stieltjes function ) , it is known that the pad sequence is convergent everywhere on the complex plane , except on the physical cut @xcite .",
    "another case of particular interest is in the limit of an infinite number of colors in which the form factor becomes a meromorphic function . in this case",
    "there is also a theorem which guarantees convergence of the pad sequence everywhere in a compact region of the complex plane , except perhaps at a finite number of points ( which include the poles in the spectrum contained in that region ) @xcite . in the real world",
    ", in which a general form factor has a complicated analytic structure with a cut , and whose spectral function is not positive definite , we do not know of any mathematical result assuring the convergence of a pad sequence @xcite .",
    "one just has to try the approximation on the data to learn what happens .",
    "in this work we have found that , to the precision allowed by the experimental data , there are sequences of pas which improve on the lowest order vmd result in a rather systematic way .",
    "this has allowed us to extract the values of the lowest - order coefficients of the low - energy expansion .",
    "we would like to emphasize that , strictly speaking , the pad approximants to a given function are ratios of two polynomials @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( with degree @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively ) , constructed such that the taylor expansion around the origin exactly coincides with that of @xmath17 up to the highest possible order , i.e. @xmath18 . however , in our case the taylor coefficients are not known .",
    "they are , in fact , the information we are seeking for .",
    "our strategy will consist in determining these coefficients by a least - squares fit of a pad approximant to the vector form factor data in the space - like region .",
    "there are several types of pas that may be considered . in order to achieve a fast numerical convergence ,",
    "the choice of which one to use is largely determined by the analytic properties of the function to be approximated . in this regard , a glance at the time - like data of the pion form factor makes it obvious that the form factor is clearly dominated by the rho meson contribution .",
    "the effect of higher resonance states , although present , is much more suppressed . in these circumstances",
    "the natural choice is a @xmath19 pad sequence  @xcite , i.e. the ratio of a polynomial of degree @xmath20 over a polynomial of degree one  .",
    "notice that , from this perspective , the vmd ansatz in ( [ vmd ] ) is nothing but the @xmath21 pad approximant .    however , to test the aforementioned single - pole dominance , one should check the degree to which the contribution from resonances other than the rho may be neglected . consequently , we have also considered the sequence @xmath22 , and the results confirm those found with the pas @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , for completeness , we have also considered the so - called pad - type approximants ( pts )  @xcite .",
    "these are rational approximants whose poles are predetermined at some fixed values , which we take to be the physical masses since they are known .",
    "notice that this is different from the case of the ordinary pas , whose poles are left free and determined by the fit . finally ,",
    "we have also considered an intermediate case , the so - called partial - pad approximants ( pps )  @xcite , in which some of the poles are predetermined ( again at the physical masses ) and some are left free .",
    "we have fitted all these versions of rational approximants to all the available pion vff space - like data  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the result of the fit is rather independent of the kind of rational approximant sequence used and all the results show consistency among themselves .",
    "the structure of this letter is the following . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] we begin by testing the efficiency of the @xmath23 pads with the help of a model . in section [ sec : ff ] we apply this very same method to the experimental vff .",
    "firstly , in sec .",
    "[ sec : pal1 ] , we use the pad approximants @xmath23 ; then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : pal2 ] , this result is cross - checked with a @xmath24 pa . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : ptpp ] , we study the pad - type and partial - pad approximants . the outcome of these analyses is combined in section  [ sec : results ] and some conclusions are extracted .",
    "in order to illustrate the usefulness of the pas as fitting functions in the way we propose here , we will first use a phenomenological model as a theoretical laboratory to check our method .",
    "furthermore , the model will also give us an idea about the size of possible systematic uncertainties .",
    "we will consider a vff phase - shift with the right threshold behavior and with approximately the physical values of the rho mass and width .",
    "the form - factor is recovered through a once - subtracted omns relation , @xmath25 where @xmath26 , which plays the role of the vector form factor phase - shift  @xcite , is given by @xmath27\\ , \\ ] ] with the @xmath28-dependent width given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the input parameters are chosen to be close to their physical values : @xmath31 we emphasize that the model defined by the expressions ( [ model]-[width ] ) should be considered as quite realistic .",
    "in fact , it has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite for extracting the values for the physical mass and width of the rho meson through a direct fit to the ( timelike ) experimental data .    expanding @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) in powers of @xmath32 we readily obtain @xmath33 with known values for the coefficients @xmath34 . in what follows , we will use eq .",
    "( [ expmodel ] ) as the definition of the coefficients @xmath34 . to try to recreate the situation of the experimental data  @xcite-@xcite with the model , we have generated fifty `` data '' points in the region @xmath35 , thirty data points in the interval @xmath36 , and seven points for @xmath37 ( all these momenta in units of gev@xmath38 ) .",
    "these points are taken with vanishing error bars since our purpose here is to estimate the systematic error derived purely from our approximate description of the form factor .",
    "we have fitted a sequence of pad approximants @xmath39 to these data points and , upon expansion of the pads around @xmath40 , we have used them to predict the values of the coefficients @xmath34 .",
    "the comparison may be found in table  [ table1 ] .",
