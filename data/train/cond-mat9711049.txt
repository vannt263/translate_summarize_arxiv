    "the largest errors tend to occur in the location of the edge of the steps of the devil s staircase , and even these errors are far too small to be visible on the plots .",
    "the lowest temperature achieved was @xmath227 , which we believe is sufficient to characterize the states of the zero temperature system ( to achieve this temperature , a constant was added to the energy so that the ground state energy was near zero , thus helping to correct for the overflow problem ) .    equation ( [ quadrule ] ) is a standard eigenvalue equation @xmath228 which was solved using the routines in lapack ( lapack library routines are provided on most workstation based systems and source code can be obtained free from netlib @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we study a josephson junction ladder in a magnetic field in the absence of charging effects via a transfer matrix formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix are found numerically , giving a determination of the different phases of the ladder . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial periodicity of the ground state exhibits a devil s staircase as a function of the magnetic flux filling factor @xmath0 . if the transverse josephson coupling is varied a continuous superconducting - normal transition in the transverse direction is observed , analogous to the breakdown of the kam trajectories in dynamical systems . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine how these properties may be affected by a current injected along the ladder . </S>"
