    "nakariakov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) reported the detection of spatial oscillations in five coronal loops with periods ranging from 258 to 320 s. the decay time was @xmath6 minutes for an oscillation of @xmath7 millihertz .",
    "also wang & solanki ( 2004 ) described a loop oscillation observed on 17 april 2002 by trace in 195@xmath8 .",
    "they interpreted the observed loop motion as a vertical oscillation , with a period of 3.9 minutes and a decay time of 11.9 minutes .",
    "all these observations indicate strong dissipation of the wave energy that may be the cause of coronal heating .    since the discovery of the hot solar corona about 66 years ago , different theories of coronal heating have been put forward and debated .",
    "ionson ( 1978 ) was first to suggest that the resonant absorption of mhd waves in coronal plasmas could be a primary mechanism in coronal heating .",
    "since then , much analytical and numerical work has been done on the subject .",
    "rae and roberts ( 1982 ) investigated both eikonal and differential equation approaches for the propagation of mhd waves in inhomogeneous plasmas .",
    "hollweg ( 1987a , b ) considered a dissipative layer of planar geometry to study the resonant absorption of coronal loops .",
    "poedts et al .",
    "( 1989 , 1990 ) developed a finite element code to elaborate on the resonant absorption of alfvn waves in circular cylinders .",

    "van doorsselaere et al .",
    "( 2004a ) used the leda code to study the resistive absorption of the kink modes of cylindrical models .",
    "they concluded that , when the width of the nonuniform layer was increased , their numerical results differed by as much as 25@xmath9 from those obtained with the analytical approximation . in the vicinity of singularity ,",
    "field gradients are large . recognizing this , sakurai et al .",
    "( 1991a , b ) and goossens et al .",
    "( 1992 , 1995 ) developed a method to analyze dissipative processes in such regimes and to neglect them elsewhere .",
    "safari et al .",
    "( 2006 ) studied the resonant absorption of mhd waves in magnetized flux tubes with a radial density inhomogeneity .",
    "using the approximation that resistive and viscous processes are operative in thin layers surrounding the singularities of the mhd equations , they obtained the full spectrum of the eigenfrequencies and damping rates of the quasi - modes of the ideal mhd of the tube .",
    "both surface and body modes were analyzed .",
    "verwichte et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , using the observations of trace , detected the multimode oscillations for the first time .",
    "they found that two loops are oscillating in both the fundamental and the first - overtone standing fast kink modes . according to the theory of mhd waves , for uniform loops",
    "the ratio of the period of the fundamental to the period of the first overtone is exactly 2 , but the ratios found by verwichte et al .",
    "( 2004 ) are 1.81 and 1.64 .",
    "however , these values were corrected to 1.82 and 1.58 , respectively , by van doorsselaere et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and thus clearly differ from 2 .",
    "this may be caused by different factors such as the effects of curvature ( see e.g. van doorsselaere et al .",
    "2004b ) , leakage ( see de pontieu et al .",
    "2001 ) , magnetic twist ( see e.g. erdlyi & fedun 2006 ; erdlyi & carter 2006 ) and density stratification in the loops ( see andries et al . 2005b ; erdelyi & verth 2007 ) .",
    "however , now it clear that the only cause of this deviation is the longitudinal density stratification .",
    "curvature does not affect sufficiently the frequencies .",
    "leakage can cause the damping of oscillations but practically does not affect the frequencies . recently",
    "ruderman ( 2007 ) showed that the magnetic twist also does not affect the frequencies .",
    "andries et al .",
    "( 2005b ) considered a coronal loop model with a straight cylindrically magnetized flux tube .",

    "( 2005b ) , showed that in the presence of a longitudinal density stratification the ratio of the periods of the fundamental kink mode of a coronal loop and of its first harmonic is lower than 2 .",
    "they used this ratio to estimate the density scaleheight in the solar atmosphere .",
    "arregui et al .",
    "( 2005 ) studied the effects of both radial and longitudinal density stratifications on the frequency and damping rate of resonantly fast kink modes . using a numerical code ( pollux ) , they solved the linear resistive mhd equations for a cylindrical flux tube model with a wide range of values of several loop parameters .",
    "safari et al .",
    "( 2007 ) investigated the oscillations of coronal loops in presence of vertical stratification for a zero-@xmath0 plasma .",
    "they solved the radial equation in the thin tube approximation and the transverse equation by both perturbational and numerical techniques .",
    "they confirmed the result obtained by andries et al .",
    "( 2005a ) that the ratio of periods of the fundamental and first - overtone modes differ from 2 in loops with longitudinal density stratification .",
    "karami & asvar ( 2007 , hereafter paper i ) studied both the oscillations and damping of standing fast mhd body waves in coronal loops in the presence of both longitudinal density stratification and radial density structuring .",
    "the radial structuring was assumed to have a step - like density profile .",
    "they derived both the frequencies and damping rates of the fundamental , first - overtone and second - overtone frequencies of both the kink and fluting modes .",
    "they obtained that the ratios of the frequencies of the first - overtone and its fundamental mode for both the kink and fluting modes are lower than 2 ( for unstratified loops ) .    in the present work ,",
    "our aim is to investigate the effects of longitudinal density stratification and radial density structuring on resonant absorption of standing quasi - modes of the ideal mhd in the cold coronal loops observed by verwichte et al .",
