    "the infrared spectrum of hr  4049 does not show the dust features typically associated with circumstellar material around evolved stars ( e.g.  silicates or sic ) and thus the nature of the dust remains a mystery .",
    "instead , the infrared excess is well - represented by a single temperature ( @xmath6  k ) black body from the onset of dust emission in the near - ir to submillimetre ( submm ) wavelengths . at the same time , the dust re - emits a significant fraction of the total stellar luminosity ( @xmath7 ) , from which @xcite deduced that hr 4049 is surrounded by an extremely optically thick and vertically extended disk with a hot inner wall . in this",

[ [ plateau - emission ] ] plateau emission + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in addition to the small emission features in our residuals , we note that we are unable to properly reproduce the continuum beyond @xmath1417.6  @xmath9 m .",
    "indeed , examining figs .",
    "[ fig : sh_zoom ] and [ fig : midir_fits ] , we see that we systematically overestimate the continuum emission at lh wavelengths . as well , we note that one of the major differences between the spitzer - irs and iso - sws spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : midobservations ] is the presence of emission from a continuum - like  plateau \" under the co@xmath0emission in the spitzer spectrum .",
    "if we force the dust continuum to represent the lh continuum more accurately , we find that our models cease to reproduce the narrow emission bands from co@xmath0 .",
    "if we instead fit the narrow emission features , we overestimate the dust continuum at lh wavelengths . we have chosen to use a model which reproduces the narrow co@xmath0features , but we note that the dust continuum from our best fit model is much higher than it should be as a result .",
    "part of this plateau emission is likely due to the presence of c@xmath10 .",

    "in addition , the carrier of this plateau emission appears to have formed between the observations by iso and spitzer since this is perhaps the most obvious difference between the two spectra .",
    "we therefore considered two possible sources for this plateau emission .",
    "first , we considered the possibility that this could be due to broad pah emission from c - c - c bending modes , which has been observed to form a continuum between 15 and 20 @xmath9m(e.g .   * ? ? ?",

    "these pah plateaus also often show narrow features at 16.4 , 17.4 and 18.9 @xmath9malong with a weak 15.8  @xmath9mfeature @xcite .",
    "however , we do not see any obvious pah features to the red of the 12.7  @xmath9mfeature .",
    "therefore , we consider it unlikely that this plateau is due to pah emission .",
    "another possible candidate for this plateau emission is co@xmath0 .",
    "while our co@xmath0models predict some continuum - like emission , it is not enough to match the plateau we observe .",
    "we do find high optical depths for co@xmath0(@xmath49 for the main isotopologue using a line width of 3 km s@xmath25 , this would decrease to @xmath50 for 10  km  s@xmath25 ) as well as some evidence for temperature stratification in the residuals and possibly recent co@xmath0formation which could result in some non - lte emission .",
    "we therefore consider that the plateau emission could be due to co@xmath0emission that our models are unable to fit properly .",
    "we will explore this possibility further in section [ sec : discussion : time ] .",
    "we note that a similar plateau was also observed in @xcite and was attributed to optically thick co@xmath0emission .",

    "we thus decided to compare the predictions from our model at these wavelengths to the iso - sws spectrum .",
    "we extended our model spectra to shorter wavelengths and smoothed the spectrum covered only by the iso - sws spectrum to a resolution of 300 to match these data .",
    "we present our prediction for these bands in the main plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : midir_fits ] .",
    "these predictions do not appear to fit the iso - sws spectrum on first sight .",
    "however , some of the features do appear to be reproduced . examining the co@xmath0feature at 4.2  @xmath9 m",
    ", we note that this band is heavily blended with the much broader co emission band at 4.6  @xmath9 m .",
    "it appears , however , that the co@xmath0feature within this broader band is reproduced reasonably well .",
    "if we examine our predictions for the h@xmath0ospectrum , there is a broad emission feature between 5 and 8  @xmath9 m .",
    "it is difficult to assess how well this broad band reproduces the spectrum in these regions due to the presence of the co emission feature and the pah features .",
    "however , our model predicts a fairly strong h@xmath0ofeature at 6.62  @xmath9mwhich is much weaker in the iso - sws spectrum .    finally ,",
    "although hcn also has an overtone mode at @xmath147 @xmath9 m , our models do not predict it at these temperatures and column densities .",
    "since the iso - sws spectrum has a much larger wavelength coverage , it covers additional molecular bands ( such as the 4.2  @xmath9mco@xmath0feature ) and species ( co at 4.6  @xmath9 m ) , so we decided to fit this spectrum as well .",
    "we used the same techniques described for fitting the spitzer - irs spectrum , but we included co in our model ( using line lists from * ? ? ?",
    "* including the @xmath32co , c@xmath4o and c@xmath5o isotopologues ) and excluded hcn .",
    "we fit the spectrum in several regions to include as many molecular features as possible while excluding features we can not fit ( e.g.  the pahs ) .",
    "thus , we used three fitting regions , first , between 2.4 and 5.8  @xmath9 m , then from 9.5 to 10.5  @xmath9mand finally from 14 to 22  @xmath9 m .",
    "the parameters for our best fit are presented in table [ table : mirfits ] and this model is compared to the 3 to 17 @xmath9mregion of the iso - sws spectrum in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : midir_fits ] . in our direct fit to the iso - sws spectrum , we find that the fit in the 4  @xmath9mregion is greatly improved with the addition of co and a more appropriate scaling factor for the continuum .",
    "however , we note that there are still issues in the h@xmath0oemission at 6.62  @xmath9mwhere we fit a large emission spike which does not appear in the spectrum .",
    "in addition , there are some residuals at @xmath1416  @xmath9 m .    [ [ time - dependence ] ] time dependence + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    when we compare the iso - sws and spitzer observations , we find that there is a dramatic increase in emission between 10 and 18  @xmath9 m .",
    "if we subtract a 1150  k black body continuum from each spectrum and integrate the remaining flux between 13.4 and 16.8  @xmath9 m , we find that the flux from molecular emission has more than doubled in this region between the time of the iso and spitzer observations ( from @xmath51  w  m@xmath52 to @xmath53  w  m@xmath52 ) .",
    "the better quality of the spitzer - irs data and current line lists allow a much more in - depth analysis of the gas than was previously possible .",
    "as we shall see , many of the results of this analysis have important consequences for the properties of the circumbinary disk .",
    "we remind the reader that in the optically thin limit , @xcite determined that hr  4049 was extremely enriched in and ( / = @xmath54 ; / = @xmath55 ) . in a subsequent study of the near - ir co bands , @xcite found isotopic ratios consistent with solar values and they suggested that the ratios determined by @xcite were incorrect because the co@xmath0emission in hr  4049 is actually optically thick . based on our models , we are able to confirm the suggestion by @xcite that the co@xmath0is optically thick , but we determine a ratio of 160@xmath20 for / and 160@xmath22 for / , indicating some enrichment in and relative to solar values ( / = 2700 , / = 479 , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , these isotopes are enriched relative to tyical agb stars ( where both are on the order of a 10@xmath52 to 10@xmath56 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , the enrichment of and in hr  4049 appears to be similar to that of the ba star hd  101013 ( @xmath28o/@xmath4o = 100@xmath57 , @xmath28o/@xmath5o = 60@xmath58 , * ? ? ?",
    "there are also recent detections of oc@xmath5o in two other binary post - agb objects : and which both show enrichment in ( @xmath28o/@xmath5o of 19 for ep lyr and 100 for hd 52961 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as well as a study of enrichment in r coronae borealis stars in which / ratios less than one were found @xcite .",
    "we also note that the values we find here for the enrichment of and are more suitable to the scenario proposed by @xcite who suggested that the isotopic ratios for oxygen in hr  4049 could be due to nova nucleosynthesis ; though hr  4049 lacks the uv flux for a typical white dwarf companion @xcite .",
    "however , due to the high optical depths we find , our values are poorly determined and our uncertainties on these values are likely to be larger than we find from our models .",
    "we also suggest that there may be similar issues with the / values in the other post - agb objects for the same reason .",
    "our best fit models appear to indicate an enrichment in , with / of 6@xmath18 .",
    "this relatively low value agrees with an early termination of the agb due to accelerated mass loss along the orbital plane of the binary @xcite .",
    "this has been observed in other binary post - agb objects such as ep lyr @xcite .",
    "however , optically thick co@xmath0emission also makes this ratio uncertain .      from our models , we find that not only is the co@xmath0emission optically thick , but the gas is optically thick across the entire spectrum ( e.g.  @xmath59 for h@xmath0oacross the entire spitzer - irs spectrum ) .",
    "this has some very important ramifications .",
    "for instance , when the gas is optically thick , the flux will scale with the emitting area , thus we are able to estimate the spatial extent of the gas using our models .",
    "when we calculate our models , we obtain a scale factor ( @xmath60 ) which relates @xmath61 from our radiative transfer calculations to @xmath62 .",
    "we are able to relate this scale factor to the surface area ( @xmath63 ) of the emitting layer such that @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the distance to hr  4049 .    from our model fit to the spitzer - irs data , we find a value of @xmath66 for @xmath60 .",
    "if we use a distance of 640  pc for hr 4049 ( as described by * ? ?",
    "* ) , this scale factor corresponds to a projected area of 1117  au@xmath52 . if we perform the same analysis using our best fit to the iso - sws spectrum ( with @xmath67 )",
    ", we find a projected area of 1097 au@xmath52 , which agrees reasonably well with the emitting region we estimate from our spitzer - irs data .",
    "since the scale factors we determine have not changed much between the iso and spitzer observations despite the differences in column densities between the two models , this also supports our claim of optically thick gas .",
    "if we then assume an inclination angle of 60@xmath68 ( which is agreed upon by both current models for the disk ) , we find an actual emitting surface of 1290 au@xmath52 for our molecular emission . if we consider how this surface area would fit into the current disk models , we note that this would not fit on the inner rim of the wall model .",
    "this suggests that the gas belongs to a radially extended disk instead .",
    "if we assume that the gas exists some distance from the center of the binary system , we can estimate the maximum extent of the disk .",
    "were the gas to originate 10 au from the binary ( as the dust in the wall model , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it would extend to a distance of 23 au .",
    "if the gas begins at 15 au from the binary ( based on the interferometric observations by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it would extend to 25  au , a distance which agrees well with the maximum radial extent of the disk determined from the interferometric observations by @xcite",
    ".    it would be reasonable to suppose that the gas is mixed in with any dust in the circumbinary disk of hr  4049 . as described by @xcite ,",
    "dust grains in a gas - rich disk tend to settle toward the midplane of the disk , so the gas we observe could form a sort of atmosphere on the outside of the disk .",
    "there could also be more gas inside the disk which we are unable to observe since this atmosphere is optically thick .",
    "however , the gas on the inside of the disk could contribute to the opacity of the disk by providing some continuum - like emission similar to that we observe in our models .    as the lte models reproduce the emission spectrum well and the gas appears to be reasonably warm ( 500  k )",
    ", we find that we can not reconcile our observations to a wall - type model for the dust .",
    "the wall model contains cold dust beyond the inner rim of the disk @xcite , which would result in cold gas in this region .",
    "instead , we observe a large region of warm gas so we find this sort of model improbable .",
    "it would also be difficult to reconcile our observations to the disk model presented by @xcite in which the dust is optically thin .",
    "@xcite include gas in their disk to determine the scale height , however co@xmath0and h@xmath0oare both excellent at trapping infrared radiation , especially at high column densities like those we observe in this disk and these effects are not included in their model .    since these molecules are largely transparent at optical wavelengths , the stellar radiation will warm the dust grains .",
    "these grains will then re - emit this radiation in the infrared which will be absorbed and re - emitted by the gas in the disk , effectively trapping the radiation inside the disk .",
    "this will not only have the effect of warming the disk overall , but it will also keep the temperature relatively homogenous throughout the disk .",
    "thus the disk could have the sort of narrow temperature range suggested by @xcite , who determined that the sed of hr  4049 can be fit either by a 1150  k black body or by the sum of several equally weighted black bodies within a range of 880 k @xmath69 1325 k.    however , in lte , a gas can not appear in emission in front of a hotter background source .",
    "thus , we will explore alternate excitation mechanisms which could result in bands which emit in a way which appears similar to lte in section [ sec : discussion : time ] .      using the projected size for the emitting region and our column densities",
    ", we can estimate lower limits for the masses of the molecular species we observe in this system .",
    "then , combining these with photospheric abundances , we can estimate a lower limit for the total mass of the gas in the circumbinary environment of hr  4049 .    from our model fit to the spitzer - irs data ,",
    "we calculate a mass of @xmath70 m@xmath71 for co@xmath0 , @xmath72 m@xmath71 for h@xmath0oand @xmath73 m@xmath71 for hcn .",
    "similarly , for the iso - sws model , we find masses of @xmath74 m@xmath71 for co@xmath0 , @xmath75 m@xmath71 for h@xmath0oand @xmath76 m@xmath71 of co.    since the gas is oxygen - rich , we use the carbon abundance determined by ( * ? ? ? * log @xmath77 ) along with the number of carbon - containing molecules and determine a lower limit for the total gas mass of @xmath78 m@xmath2 in the disk .",
    "this estimate is higher than the mass estimated by @xcite , who estimated @xmath79 m@xmath71 for the total mass of the disk .",
    "this could indicate a higher gas to dust ratio in the disk ( they use a value of 100 ) or the presence of even more dust in this system than predicted by the wall model . if we compare our estimate for the gas mass to the dust mass from (",
    "* in which @xmath80 m@xmath71 ) , we find a gas - to - dust ratio of approximately 10@xmath48 .",
    "this appears unreasonably high , however this is the estimated mass for only the small grains in the disk , which are responsible for the near- and mid - ir sed as well as the optical and uv extinction .",
    "their model also includes a cold dust component to reproduce the flux at the far - ir and submm wavelengths , which would contain more mass .",
    "since the gas is optically thick , this estimate will not include all the gas in the system ( e.g.  any gas beyond the optically thick layer or on the side of the disk inclined away from us is not included ) .",
    "in addition , since the majority of the gas included in our estimate is co which only appears in the iso - sws spectrum , this may not describe the current gas mass since , as we will describe presently , it appears there is significant ongoing gas formation in hr 4049 .",
    "it is somewhat surprising to see that the co@xmath0flux has increased by a factor of 2.5 between the iso - sws and spitzer - irs observations ( see section [ sec : spitzerviso ] ) .",
    "since we scaled the spitzer - irs observations to match the iras flux point at 25  @xmath9 m , we considered that this could be an issue in our comparison of these observations .",
    "however , the iso - sws spectrum was also scaled to the same point so this is unlikely to change our observation .",
    "furthermore , it is not just the flux that has changed under the co@xmath0emission features , but also the shape of the  continuum \" and features in this region .",
    "thus , it appears that the change in the emission features is real .",
    "we compared the phase between the two observations using the phase information from @xcite .",
    "the sh observations were taken at a phase ( @xmath81 ) of 0.844 , while the iso - sws speed 2 observations were taken at @xmath82 , near the photometric minumum .",
    "there are also the iso - sws speed 1 observations available , which were taken at a similar phase as the spitzer - irs observations ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "we thus compared the two iso - sws observations to see if there was a change in this region of the spectrum which could be attributed to phase .",
    "when we did so , we found that the spectra of the speed 1 and speed 2 iso - sws observations were roughly the same within the uncertainty mesurements on the fluxes .",
    "thus , we conclude that the amount of emitting co@xmath0gas we can observe has increased between the observations by iso - sws and those by spitzer - irs observations .",
    "if the gas were optically thin , this would imply that co@xmath0 has been forming at a rate of @xmath84 m@xmath71 yr@xmath25 assuming a constant formation rate .",
    "we note that this represents a considerable and rapid increase in co@xmath0 in the system , however , as we discovered , the co@xmath0emission in the mid - ir spectrum is not optically thin so this represents a lower limit to the increase in co@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we can not know whether the formation has been continuous between the observations so this is a crude estimate for the formation rate .    while @xcite reported a mass - loss rate from hr  4049 of @xmath85 m@xmath71 yr@xmath25 ,",
    "the amount of carbon and oxygen in the stellar winds is insufficient to permit the formation of so much new material .",
    "therefore , we consider that the co@xmath0we observe is forming from the interaction between the stellar wind and the dust disk .",
    "the ongoing formation of oxygen - rich gas thus suggests that the dust contains an oxygen - rich component ( e.g.  silicates ) and the absence of features from these dust species in the spectrum would therefore be due to obscuration of these features by optically thick gas ; or by the dust being optically thick or perhaps  being composed of large dust grains which have a smooth opacity .",
    "if the dust is primarily oxygen - rich , then hr  4049 would also be consistent with other post - agb binaries in this regard  ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    while this may appear to be inconsistent with the fact that small dust grains are required to explain the optical and uv extinction , it was noted by @xcite that the extinction at short wavelengths and the ir excess do not need to be caused by the same population of dust grains",
    "thus , although the optical and uv extinction is described well by a population of small grains of amorphous carbon or metallic iron as described by @xcite , these grains can not be the only dust component in the disk since they can not allow the formation of the oxygen - rich gas we observe here .",
    "the presence of small carbonaceous grains in the upper region of the disk could thus contribute to the extinction at short wavelengths while a population of oxygen - rich grains could contribute to part of the ir emission .",
    "the evidence for ongoing formation of gas in the circumbinary disk of hr 4049 also suggests that the molecules are not actually in lte , and the emission we observe may be due to pumping  either _ radiative _ pumping or _ formation _ pumping . in both cases , pumping results in a large fraction of molecules in highly excited vibrational states , either through absorption of higher energy photons ( near - ir or even uv ) or alternatively as a direct result of the formation of the molecules which leaves them in the excited states . after being pumped , they cascade down by emission of the ir photons we observe . pumping",
    "would thus always produce emission at mid - ir wavelengths even when in front of hot dust .",
    "superficially , such emission spectra could resemble lte models ; their main difference would be the presence of many bands from higher vibrational levels .",
    "this could help explain the plateau emission as a forest of co@xmath0emission lines from higher energies .",
    "it is thus possible that the co@xmath0and h@xmath0oare being radiatively pumped the hot dust , but this has not been directly observed .",
    "note that all these species have strong electronic absorption bands at uv wavelengths which could be the source of the pumping through absorption of stellar radiation as well .",
    "given the high column densities of these species , it would be interesting to investigate whether this could be a contributing source of the observed uv deficit in hr 4049 @xcite .",
    "formation pumping is certainly an appealing alternative , but is not well studied . while models exist for the formation pumping of h@xmath0 after formation on dust grain surfaces ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but to our knowledge no such models exist for co@xmath0or h@xmath0o .    finally , we note that while it appears that gas has been forming in the disk of hr  4049 , the overall emitting surface does not seem to have changed significantly ( remaining at @xmath141300 au@xmath52 ) .",
    "this agrees very well with the idea that the disk is relatively stable and long - lived ( also supported by the unchanging co overtone absorption observed between the observations of @xcite and those by @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite described how a gas - rich disk ( such as the one we describe ) would tend to settle toward the midplane and expand outward . using a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 and an initial scale height of 4 au",
    ", they estimated that the scale height of the disk would decrease by half in 150 years .",
    "this effect could be mitigated by a higher gas - to - dust ratio and we suggest that the gas - to - dust ratio is likely to be greater than 100 in this environment .",
    "indeed , if the dust is being slowly destroyed by stellar wind and gas is being formed , this ratio is likely to be increasing .",
    "the spitzer - irs observations clearly reveal that the molecular gas in the circumbinary disk of hr 4049 is optically thick at infrared wavelengths and that the emission originates from a radially extended disk .",
    "the gas causes a strong greenhouse effect that plays a significant role in determining the thermal structure in the disk . including the effect of optical depth",
    ", we determine that there is less of an enrichment in @xmath4o and @xmath5o than previously reported .",
    "additionally , changes in the observed flux between iso and spitzer observations suggest ongoing chemical processing of oxygen - rich dust .",
