    "moreover , we may assume that the edges of @xmath63 are tangent to @xmath20 near the vertices .",
    "next , we smoothly isotope each edge to a legendrian curve contained in a small neighbourhood of the original edge , fixing it near the vertices , and pull along @xmath13 with the isotopy . after doing this ,",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath20 need not induce the same framing of the edges .",
    "however , the framings can be arranged to agree for each edge by either stabilizing the edge sufficiently often or by sliding the edge sufficiently often over @xmath32 , cf .",

    "in particular , every null  homologous topological knot type in an overtwisted contact @xmath75manifold can be represented by the boundary of a legendrian ribbon .",
    "suppose first that @xmath74 . by taking connected sums with null",
    " homologous tori we can increase the genus of @xmath1 by any positive integer , without changing its relative homology class .",
    "due to the assumptions , this allows us to find a seifert surface @xmath13 for @xmath0 , homologous to @xmath1 , with @xmath76 .",
    "so by theorem  [ t : ribbon ] , @xmath0 is the boundary of a legendrian ribbon representing the class @xmath73\\in h_2(m , k)$ ] .",
    "the last statement holds because any topological knot type in an overtwisted contact 3manifold can be realized by a transverse knot @xmath0 in the complement of an overtwisted disk , and by repeated destabilization we can arrange @xmath74 .",
    "as it is shown in @xcite , the situation in tight contact structures is quite different : a transverse knot bounding a legendrian ribbon is quasipositive in the sense of rudolph  @xcite .",
    "quasipositivity is quite a strong condition , as it implies chirality .",
    "for example , the figure8 knot is not quasipositive since it is achiral , i.e. topologically equivalent to its mirror image .",
    "a classification of quasipositive knots up to 10 crossings is given in @xcite .",
