    "diffraction has been studied extensively in hadron - hadron scattering at small momentum transfers  @xcite .",

    "the hypothesis that diffraction may have a partonic component  @xcite has been substantiated by the observation of a high transverse energy jet production in diffractive @xmath19 scattering  @xcite . however , in hadron - hadron scattering both collision partners are extended objects which makes the extraction of the underlying partonic process(es ) difficult . in deep - inelastic electron - proton scattering ( dis ) , on the other hand , the virtual photon has a pointlike coupling to quarks .",
    "the @xmath20 collider hera offers a unique opportunity to study the partonic structure of diffraction since it gives access to the regime of large photon virtualities @xmath6 ( @xmath6 = 10 - 1000 gev@xmath5 ) and large energy transfers between the virtual photon and the target proton in its rest system , @xmath21 = 2 - 20 tev , where @xmath22 is the bjorken scaling variable and @xmath23 is the proton mass .",
    "the diffractive dissociation of the virtual photon , first recognized by the presence of a class of events with a large rapidity gap  @xcite , has opened a window for a systematic study of diffraction in reactions initiated by a hard probe  @xcite -  @xcite .    in this paper , we present a measurement of the diffractive cross section for @xmath24 and of the diffractive structure function @xmath14  @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are the particle systems produced by dissociation of the virtual photon and the proton .",

    "the latter is directly related to the proton structure function @xmath27 .",
    "the principal signatures for a partonic behaviour in dis at small @xmath22 were found to be a logarithmic dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath6 associated with a rapid rise as @xmath22 decreases  @xcite .",

    ", diffraction is characterized by the exchange of a colourless object , e.g. a colour singlet two - gluon system , between the incoming virtual photon and proton .",
    "the exchange of a colourless system suppresses qcd radiation , and therefore the production of hadrons , in comparison with nondiffractive scattering . in the diffractive events studied in this analysis most of the hadronic energy",

    "the kinematic variables @xmath69 and @xmath7 were determined from calorimeter and tracking information .",
    "the calorimeter cells were required to have energy deposits above 60 mev in the emc section and 110 mev in the hac section unless these energy deposits were isolated in which case thresholds of 120 mev ( 160 mev ) in the emc ( hac ) sections were used .",

    "a systematic uncertainty of 3% is assigned to the hadronic energy measurement .",
    "the selected clusters and tracks are called energy flow objects ( efo s ) .    the kinematic variables @xmath22 , @xmath6 and @xmath8 were determined with the double angle ( da ) method  @xcite in which only the angles of the scattered positron ( @xmath74 ) and the produced hadronic system ( @xmath75 ) are used .",

    "the requirement @xmath82 0.02 ensured a good measurement of the angle @xmath75 and hence of @xmath22 . by requiring 40 @xmath83 70 gev , where @xmath84 summed over all efo s , including those belonging to the scattered positron , both the background from photoproduction and the radiative corrections were reduced .",
    "the primary event vertex was determined from the tracks .",
    "if no tracking information was present ( 9.2% of the events ) the vertex position was set to the nominal interaction point .    after the selection cuts and removal of events from qed compton scattering and cosmic rays , the dis sample contained 304k events .",
    "for the present analysis , 157k events with @xmath85 gev , @xmath86 gev@xmath5 were used .",
    "monte carlo simulations were used for testing the validity of the subtraction of the nondiffractive contribution , for understanding the contribution from double dissociation ( @xmath87 ) , for unfolding the produced event distributions from the measured ones , for determining the acceptance and for estimating the systematic uncertainties .",

    "these characteristics are properties of events with uniform , random and uncorrelated particle production along the rapidity axis where particles are accepted in a limited range of rapidity . in models such as the feynman gas model or one dominated by longitudinal phase space  @xcite , the slope @xmath133 represents the particle multiplicity per unit of rapidity .",
