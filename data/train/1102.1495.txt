    "the x - ray spectra from the supernova remnants ( snrs ) show various emission lines of heavy elements blown off by the supernova ( sn ) explosions .",
    "since these elements are generated by the nucleosynthesis process inside the progenitor stars , the metal abundance pattern provides us with a clue to obtaining the information about the type of the sn explosion and the condition of the progenitor star .",
    "the cygnus loop is one of the largest ( @xmath6 in radius ; @xcite ) and the brightest snrs in the x - ray sky .",
    "it is close to us ( 540@xmath7 pc ; @xcite ) and the age is estimated to be @xmath210,000 yr . although the sn type of the cygnus loop is still unclear , @xcite proposed that the sn explosion had occurred in a preexisting cavity and some other studies also support this result ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite observed the balmer - dominated northeast rim of the loop and showed the blast wave was decelerated from @xmath2400 km s@xmath8 to less than 200 km s@xmath8 in the last 1,000 yr , which suggests that the blast wave is now propagating into the cavity wall .",
    "since the cygnus loop is an evolved shell - like snr , the spectra from the rim regions should mainly consist of the shock - heated cavity material .",
    "then , by using optical and x - ray data obtained from the whole rim region of the loop , @xcite calculated the size of the cavity wall and estimated the progenitor star to be b0 , a @xmath215  star .",
    "this result supports the origin of the cygnus loop to be a core - collapse explosion rather than the type ia explosion .",
    "meanwhile , based on the analysis of the ejecta emission in x - rays , some previous studies also suggested that the cygnus loop is originated from a massive star of 12 - 15  @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed this snr along the diameter from the northeast to the southwest with the _ xmm - newton _ satellite and showed the x - ray spectra consist of two components with different temperatures .",
    "they interpreted this result as follows : the low - temperature component originating from the cavity wall surrounds the high - temperature ejecta component . comparing the metal abundances ( ne , mg , si , s , and fe ) of the ejecta component with the theoretical sn models",
    ", they concluded that the cygnus loop is originated from the 15  star . @xcite and",
    "@xcite observed other regions of the loop and also inferred the progenitor mass to be 12 - 15 .",
    "these results are consistent with the estimation by @xcite .",
    "therefore the origin of the cygnus loop is most likely to be a core - collapse explosion of a 12 - 15  star .",
    "however , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite show that the number density of fe ( relative to that of o ) is @xmath210 times higher than that of the core - collapse model .",
    "the other problem is that the central compact object such as a neutron star has not yet been detected .",

    "the solar wind charge exchange ( swcx ) is also considered to be one of the causes of the soft x - ray background below 1 kev @xcite . however , in terms of the cygnus loop , the swcx is also negligible because of the prominent surface brightness in the low - energy band .",
