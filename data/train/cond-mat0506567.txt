    "relevance of structural disorder for the critical behaviour remains to be an important problem of modern condensed matter physics .",
    "even a weak disorder may change drastically the behaviour near the critical point and in this respect may be related to the global characteristics of a physical system , such as the space dimension , order parameter symmetry and the origin of interparticle interaction . in this paper",
    ", we are going to discuss some peculiarities of a paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase transition in magnets , where the randomness of structure has the form of substitutional random - site or random - bond quenched disorder .",
    "solid solutions of magnets with small concentration of non - magnetic component as well as amorphous magnets with large relaxation times may serve as an example of such systems .",
    "intuitively , it is clear that for a weak enough disorder the ferromagnetic phase persists in such systems .",
    "obviously , intuition fails to predict whether the critical exponents characterizing phase transition into ferromagnetic state will differ in a disordered system and in a  pure \" one .",
    "the answer here is given by the harris criterion @xcite which states that the critical exponents of the disordered system are changed only if the heat capacity critical exponent of a pure system is positive , otherwise the critical exponents of a disordered system coincide with those of a pure one .",
    "returning to @xmath1 dimensional magnets with @xmath2 symmetric spontaneous magnetization one is lead to the conclusion , that here only the critical exponents of uniaxial magnets described by the @xmath1 ising model ( @xmath3 ) are the subject of influence by weak quenched disorder .",
    "indeed , the heat capacity diverges @xmath4 @xcite for @xmath3 , whereas it does not diverge for the easy - plane and heisenberg - like magnets : @xmath5 and @xmath6 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively @xcite .",
    "note however that the harris criterion tells about the scaling behaviour _ at _ the critical point @xmath9 .",
    "in other words it predicts ( possible ) changes in the _ asymptotic _ values of the critical exponents defined at @xmath9 . in real situations",
    "one often deals with the _ effective _ critical exponents governing scaling when @xmath9 still is not reached @xcite .",
    "these are non - universal .",
    "as far as in our study of particular interest will be the isothermal magnetic susceptibility @xmath10 let us define the corresponding effective exponent by @xcite : @xmath11 in the limit @xmath12 the effective exponent coincides with the asymptotic one @xmath13 .",
    "already in the first experimental studies of weakly diluted uniaxial ( ising - like ) @xmath1 random magnets @xcite the asymptotic values of critical exponents were found . for the solid solutions ,",
    "the exponents do not depend on the concentration of non - magnetic component and belong to the new universality class @xcite as predicted by the harris criterion .",
    "we do not know analogous experiments where an influence of disorder on criticality of easy - plane magnets was examined .",
    "however its irrelevance was experimentally proven @xcite for the superfluid phase transition in @xmath14 which belongs to the same @xmath15 universality class as the ferromagnetic phase transition in easy - plane magnets .    as far as the disorder should be irrelevant for the asymptotic critical behaviour of the heisenberg magnets , the diluted @xmath1 heisenberg magnets should belong to the same @xmath16 universality class as the pure ones .",
    "theoretically predicted values of the isothermal magnetic susceptibility , correlation length , heat capacity , pair correlation function , and the order parameter _ asymptotic _",
    "critical exponents in this universality class read @xcite : @xmath17 the experimental picture is more controversial .",
    "the bulk of experiments on critical behaviour of disordered heisenberg - like magnets performed up to middle 80-ies is discussed in the comprehensive reviews @xcite .",
    "more recent experiments may be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "we show typical results of measurements of the isothermal magnetic susceptibility effective critical exponent @xmath18 ( [ 1 ] ) in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] . as it is seen from the pictures ,",
    "the behaviour of @xmath18 is non - monotonic .",
    "the exponent differs from its value predicted in the asymptotic limit ( [ 2 ] ) and is a subject of a wide crossover behaviour . before reaching asymptotics @xmath18 possess maximum ( except of the fig .",
    "[ fig1].d ) , the value of the maximum is system dependent : it differs for different magnets .",
    "it is standard now to rely on the renormalization group ( rg ) method @xcite to get a reliable quantitative description of the behaviour in the vicinity of critical point .",
    "namely in this way the cited above values ( [ 2 ] ) of the critical exponents of @xmath1 heisenberg model were obtained .",
    "the rg approach appeared to be a powerful tool to describe asymptotic @xcite and effective @xcite critical behaviour of disordered ising - like magnets as well .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to describe the crossover behaviour of disordered heisenberg - like magnets in frames of the field - theoretical rg technique . in particular",
    "we want to calculate theoretically the isothermal magnetic susceptibility effective critical exponent and to explain in this way the appearance of the peak in its typical experimental dependencies .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the section [ ii ]",
    "we formulate the model and review main theoretical results obtained for it so far by means of the rg technique , effective critical behaviour is analyzed in the section [ iii ] , we end by conclusions and outlook in the section [ iv ] .    *",

    "the model of a random quenched magnet we are going to consider is described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath19 here , the sum spans over all sites @xmath20 of @xmath21-dimensional hypercubic lattice , @xmath22 is a short - range ( ferro)magnetic interaction between classical  spins \" @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we consider the spins @xmath23 to be @xmath25-component vectors and the hamiltonian ( [ 3 ] ) contains their scalar product . obviously , for the particular case of heisenberg spins we will put later @xmath8 .",
    "the randomness is introduced into the hamiltonian ( [ 3 ] ) by the occupation numbers @xmath26 which are equal 1 if the site @xmath20 is occupied by a spin and @xmath27 if the site is empty .",
    "considering the case when occupied sites are distributed without any correlation and fixed in certain configuration one obtains so - called uncorrelated quenched @xmath25-vector model .    in principle , the above information is enough to apply the rg approach for a study of the critical behaviour of the model ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "one should obtain an effective hamiltonian corresponding to the model under consideration and then one analyzes its long - distance properties by analyzing appropriate rg equations @xcite . but already on this step there are at least two different possibilities to proceed and both were exploited for the model ( [ 3 ] ) . on one hand , to get the free energy of the model one can average the logarithm of configuration - dependent partition function over different possible configurations of disorder @xcite .",
    "then , making use of the replica trick @xcite one arrives to the familiar effective hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath28 describing in the replica limit @xmath29 critical properties of the model ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "here , @xmath30 is a bare mass , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are bare couplings and @xmath33 is an @xmath34-replica of @xmath25-component vector field .",
    "the prevailing amount of rg studies of the critical behaviour of quenched @xmath25-vector model was performed on the base of the effective hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) @xcite .",
    "however , one more effective hamiltonian corresponding to the model ( [ 3 ] ) is discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "it is obtained exploiting the idea that a quenched disordered system can be described as an equilibrium system with additional forces of constraints @xcite . in such approach both variables @xmath35 and @xmath26 are treated equivalently and one ends up with the effective hamiltonian which differs from ( [ 4 ] ) and , consequently , leads to different results for the critical behaviour of the model ( [ 3 ] ) @xcite . whereas the effective hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) was used in the wide context of general @xmath25-vector models @xcite , the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite was mainly used in explanations of crossover behaviour in heisenberg - like systems @xcite .",
    "below , we will discuss our results , based on the effective hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) for @xmath8 and compare them with those derived in @xcite .",
    "as it is well known , the renormalization group ( rg ) approach makes use of the scaling symmetry of the system in the asymptotic limit to extract the universal content and at the same time removes divergencies which occur for the evaluation of the bare functions in this limit @xcite . a change in the renormalized couplings @xmath36",
    ", @xmath37 of the effective hamiltonian ( [ 3 ] ) under the rg transformation is described by the flow equations : @xmath38 here , @xmath39 is the flow parameter related to the distance @xmath40 to the critical point . the fixed points ( @xmath41 ) of the system of differential equations ( [ 5 ] ) are given by : @xmath42 a fixed point is said to be stable if the stability matrix @xmath43 possess in this point eigenvalues @xmath44 with positive real parts . in the limit @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 attain the stable fixed point values @xmath41 .",
    "if the stable fixed point is reachable from the initial conditions ( let us recall that for the effective hamiltonian ( [ 3 ] ) they read @xmath48 ) it corresponds to the critical point of the system .",
    "the asymptotic critical exponents values are defined by the fixed point values of the rg @xmath49-functions .",
    "in particular the isothermal magnetic susceptibility exponent @xmath49 is expressed in terms of the rg functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 describing renormalization of the field @xmath52 and of the two - point vertex function with a @xmath53 insertion correspondingly @xcite : @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) , the functions @xmath55 , @xmath56 are calculated in the stable fixed point @xmath41 . in the rg scheme ,",
    "the effective critical exponents are calculated in the region , where couplings @xmath57 have not reached their fixed point values and depend on @xmath39 .",
    "in particular for the exponent @xmath18 one gets : @xmath58}{2-{\\gamma}_{\\phi } [ u\\{\\ell(\\tau)\\},v\\{\\ell(\\tau)\\}]}+\\dots.\\ ] ] in ( [ 8 ] ) the part denoted by dots is proportional to the @xmath59functions ( [ 5 ] ) and comes from the change of the amplitude part of the susceptibility .",
    "in the subsequent calculations we will neglect this part , taking the contribution of the amplitude function to the crossover to be small @xcite .    for the effective hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) , the fixed point structure is well established @xcite . it is schematically shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2].a , [ fig2].b .",
    "two qualitatively different scenarios are observed : for @xmath60 the critical behaviour of the disordered magnet is governed by the fixed point of the pure magnet ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) , whereas for @xmath63 the new stable fixed point ( @xmath61 , @xmath64 ) governs the asymptotic critical behaviour of the disordered magnet . at the marginal dimensionality @xmath65 which separates these two regimes , the @xmath34 exponent of the pure magnet equals zero in agreement with the harris criterion .",
    "max.eps    best theoretical estimates of @xmath65 definitely support @xmath66 : @xmath67 @xcite , @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "consequently , the fixed point structure of the model of diluted heisenberg - like magnet ( @xmath8 ) is given by fig .",
    "[ fig2].*a * : the stable reachable fixed points of the diluted and pure heisenberg - like magnets do coincide ( @xmath69 ) , hence their _ asymptotic _ critical exponents do coincide as well .",
    "however the last statement does not concern the _ effective _ exponents .",
    "these are defined by the running values of the couplings @xmath70 and will be calculated in the next section .",
    "the rg functions of the model ( [ 4 ] ) are known by now in pretty high orders of the perturbation theory @xcite . for the purpose of present study",
    "we will restrict ourselves by the first approximation where the described crossover phenomena manifests itself for the heisenberg - like disordered magnets in non - trivial way .",
    "within the two loop approximation in the minimal subtraction rg scheme @xcite the rg - functions read @xcite : @xmath71 here , @xmath72 and replica limit @xmath73 is to be taken .",
    "starting form the expressions ( [ 9])([12 ] ) one can either develop the @xmath74-expansion , or work directly at @xmath1 putting in ( [ 9 ] ) , ( [ 10 ] ) @xmath75 and considering renormalized couplings @xmath76 as the expansion parameters @xcite .",
    "however , such rg perturbation theory series with several couplings are known to be asymptotic at best @xcite .",
    "one should apply appropriate resummation technique to improve their convergence to get reliable numerical data on their basis .",
    "we used several different resummation schemes for this purpose . here",
    "we will give the results obtained by the method which allowed to analyze the largest region in the parametric @xmath77 space .",
    "the method was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and was successfully applied to study random @xmath1 ising model @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was shown that the rg functions of the @xmath78 random ising model are borel - summable by this method @xcite . the main idea proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is to consider resummation in variables @xmath36 and @xmath37 separately . taken that the rg function @xmath79 is given to the order of @xmath80 loops , one first rewrites it as a power series in @xmath37 : @xmath81 then each coefficient @xmath82 is considered as power series in @xmath36 and resummed as a function of a single variable @xmath36 thus obtaining the resummed functions @xmath83 .",
    "next one substitutes these functions into ( [ 13 ] ) and resums the rg function @xmath84 in single variable @xmath37 . for the resummation in a single variable one may use any of familiar methods .",
    "our results are obtained by making use of the pad - borel - leroy method @xcite .",
    "first , applying the above described resummation procedure to the @xmath59-functions ( [ 9 ] ) , ( [ 10 ] ) we get the pure heisenberg fixed point coordinates @xmath85 , @xmath62 .",
    "the stability matrix ( [ 6a ] ) eigenvalues are positive at this fixed point ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) providing its stability .",
    "then for the resummed values of the asymptotic critical exponents we get @xcite : @xmath88 we do not give the confidence intervals in ( [ 14 ] ) , as far as they can be estimated only by comparison of changes introduced by different orders of perturbation theory .",
    "note however that the results ( [ 14 ] ) are in a good agreement with the most accurate estimates of the exponents in the @xmath16 universality class ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "this brings about that both the considered here two - loop approximation as well as the chosen resummation technique give an adequate description of asymptotic critical phenomena .    before passing to the effective critical exponents",
    "let us first analyze the corrections to scaling . for the pure heisenberg magnet , taking into account the leading correction to scaling results in the following formula for the isothermal susceptibility : @xmath89 where the correction - to - scaling exponent is given by @xmath90 with @xmath91 . for the diluted heisenberg magnet the corresponding formula includes two leading corrections @xmath92 , @xmath93 ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath94 with critical amplitudes @xmath95 .",
    "the exponents @xmath96 are expressed in terms of the stability matrix ( [ 6a ] ) eigenvalues @xmath97 in the pure heisenberg fixed point : @xmath98 . at this fixed point ,",
    "the eigenvalues of the stability matrix ( [ 6a ] ) read : @xmath99 it is straightforward to see that the value @xmath100 coincides with the exponent @xmath101 of the pure model whereas it may be shown ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the exponent @xmath102 where @xmath34 and @xmath103 are the heat capacity and correlation length critical exponent of the pure heisenberg model . on the base of the numerical values of the exponents ( [ 14 ] )",
    "we get : @xmath104 again , obtained by us in the two - loop approximation numbers ( [ 18 ] ) can be compared with those in the six - loop approximation making use of the data ( [ 2 ] ) together with the value of @xmath101 of pure 3d heisenberg model @xmath105 @xcite . as we have noted above , in order to get the numerical values of the correction - to - scaling exponents of diluted heisenberg model",
    "it is no need to consider the rg functions ( [ 9])([12 ] ) in the whole region of couplings @xmath76 : it is enough to know them for the case of the pure model ( i.e. for @xmath106 ) .",
    "however , to get the effective exponents it is necessary to study complete set of the rg functions ( [ 9])([12 ] ) working also in the region where both couplings @xmath36 and @xmath37 differ from zero .    to this end",
    "we use the above described resummation technique in order to restore the convergence of the rg expansions in couplings @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "first we solve the system of differential equations ( [ 5 ] ) and get the running values of couplings @xmath46 , @xmath47 ( [ 9])([12 ] ) .",
    "they define the flow in the parametric space @xmath76 and in the limit @xmath107 attain the stable fixed point value ( shown by the filled box in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "flows in the parametric space of couplings .",
    "the filled box denotes the stable fixed point @xmath108 .",

    "for the model ( [ 3 ] ) , the coupling @xmath37 is proportional to variance of disorder @xcite thus one can use the ratio @xmath110 to define the degree of dilution .",
    "typical flows which are obtained for different ratios @xmath110 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] by curves 1 - 3 .",
    "we choose the starting values in the region with the appropriate signs of couplings @xmath112 near the origin ( in the vicinity of the gaussian fixed point @xmath113 shown by the filled circle in the figure ) .",
    "the flow no 1 is obtained for @xmath109 , it corresponds to the pure heisenberg model .",
    "the flow no 2 results from the small ratio @xmath110 and corresponds to the weak disorder whereas the flow no 3 is obtained for large @xmath110 and corresponds to the stronger dilution .",
    "obtained running values of coupling constant presented by flows in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] allow one to get the effective critical exponents . calculating resummed expression for the effective exponent @xmath18 ( [ 8 ] ) along the flows 1 - 3",
    "we get the results shown in the fig .",

    "the curves correspond to flows from the fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] denoted by corresponding numbers.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=70.0% ]    again , the curve 1 corresponds to the effective critical exponent of the pure heisenberg model , whereas curves 2 and 3 provide two possible scenarios for the effective exponents of the disordered heisenberg model .",
    "curve 2 corresponds to the weak dilution region : here , the exponent increases with approach to the critical point , although the crossover region is larger in comparison with the pure magnet ( compare curves 1 and 2 in fig . [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this may lead to the peculiar situation that the asymptotic value of the exponent is reached earlier than the asymptotic values of the coupling .",
    "the effective exponents for the flows originating from non - zero ratio @xmath110 always attain the value which are larger than the asymptotic one .",
    "but the absolute value of this  overshooting \" for small enough @xmath110 is too small to be observed experimentally .",
    "an experimental observation of such type of @xmath18 behaviour of the disordered heisenberg - like magnet is provided e.g. by fig .",
    "[ fig1]*d*. different behaviour of @xmath18 is demonstrated by the curve 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . here ,",
    "before reaching the asymptotic region the exponent possess a distinct peak .",
    "such behaviour is in agreement with observed experimental data presented by figs .",
    "[ fig1]*a*[fig1]*c * , [ fig1]*e*[fig1]*h*. the value of maximum depends on the initial values for the rg flows .",
    "larger ratio @xmath110 ( i.e. stronger disorder ) leads to the larger maximum .",
    "thus , within unique approach one may explain both scenarios observed in the diluted heisenberg - like magnets effective critical exponent @xmath18 behaviour .",
    "as we have noticed in the section [ ii ] , the crossover behaviour of random heisenberg - like magnets was analyzed by means of an alternative approach in @xcite .",
    "there , the quenched disordered magnet was described as an equilibrium one with additional forces of constraints @xcite .",
    "this resulted in an effective hamiltonian which differs from ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "the fixed point structure of this hamiltonian differs from those given in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and , for different concentrations , leads to different crossover regimes .",
    "in particular , it predicts that there exists a limiting value of concentration where the critical behaviour is governed by fisher - renormalized tricritical exponents @xcite which coincide with those of a @xmath1 spherical model : @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 .",
    "there exist two more fixed points which may be stable in the weak dilution regime .",
    "their stability differs in different orders of the perturbation theory ( compare @xcite and @xcite ) but the numerical values of the critical exponents do not differ essentially at these fixed points .",
    "the maximal possible value of the effective critical exponent @xmath18 has been estimated as @xmath119 @xcite . however",
    ", the distinct feature of the behaviour of @xmath120 obtained in @xcite is its monotonic dependence .",
    "hence , the experimentally observed peaks ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) can not be explained within such approach .",
    "in the present paper we used the field - theoretical rg technique to study the effective critical behaviour of diluted heisenberg - like magnets .",
    "the question of particular interest was to explain the peak in the exponent @xmath18 as function of distance from @xmath9 observed in some experiments .",
    "our two - loop calculations refined by the resummation of the perturbation theory series resulted in typical behaviour of diluted heisenberg - like magnets @xmath18 exponent represented by curves 2 and 3 in fig .",
    "the exponent can either reach it asymptotic value without demonstrating distinct maximum or it can first reach the peak and then cross - over to the asymptotic value from above . the strength of disorder is a physical reason which discriminates between these two regimes .",
    "our calculations are quite general and do not specify any particular object . in order to fit our curves to certain experiment one should include into consideration non - universal parameters to specify the magnetic system . the same concerns the flow parameter @xmath39 which as we have already noted is related to the distance to the critical point @xmath40 . in principle",
    "such calculations may be done . however we want to emphasize that our analysis shows the reason of the peak in @xmath120 dependence for different disordered magnets which belong to the @xmath16 universality class and this reason may be explained within the traditional rg approach .",
    "this concerns not only the magnetic susceptibility effective critical exponent .",
    "one more example is given by the order parameter effective exponents @xmath121 which has minimum when @xmath40 goes to zero ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "interpretation of this effect will be the goal of a separate study    in conclusion we want to note that similar peculiarities of the effective critical behaviour may be observed in studies of disordered easy - plane magnets which belong to the @xmath15 universality class .",
