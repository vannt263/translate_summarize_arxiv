    "the central radio - bright region of our galaxy , known as the sagittarius complex , is composed of three major components : the supernova remnant ( snr ) sagittarius a east ( ) , the sagittarius a west ( )  region , and sagittarius a@xmath0 ( ) , recently established as our galaxy s central massive black hole ( e.g. , ghez et al .",
    "2000 ; eckart et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "models attempting to explain the emission from  fall into three broad classes .",
    "emission is modeled as arising from thermal sources , such as a low - temperature accretion disk , from non - thermal sources such as a jet ( e.g. , melia & falcke , 2001 and references therein ) , or from a mixture of the two .",
    "such models are constrained primarily by the observed spectrum of , but large gaps in frequency coverage exist .",
    "for this reason , filling in such gaps , as with the recent near - ir detections ( ghez et al .",
    "2003 , submitted ; genzel et al .",
    "2003 ) , and extending the range of frequencies over which the source is observed is important in order to place additional observational constraints on these models .    in 1976 ,",
    "davies et al .  attempted to observe  at 410 mhz , but reported no detection above a level of 50 mjy .",
    "the first very large array ( vla ) images of the galactic center ( gc ) at 330  mhz ( pedlar et al .",
    "1989 , anantharamaiah et al .",
    "1991 ) represented a major improvement in sensitivity and resolution over previous meter wavelength images .",
    "pedlar et al .  did not detect  down to a 5@xmath1 level of 100 mjy . though anantharamaiah et al .",
    "had higher sensitivity , ( rms @xmath2 ) they also reported a non - detection .",
    "the absence of any detections below 1000 mhz was interpreted as thermal absorption obscuring , indicating the low frequency properties of  are dominated by extrinsic absorption , not intrinsic emission .",
    "new low frequency detections of , including the first detection of the source below 1 ghz ( 610 mhz ; roy et al .",
    "2003 ) , and this 330 mhz detection suggest that the low frequency properties of  and the implied line of sight optical depths need to be re - examined .",
    "the galactic center was observed at  330  mhz using the very large array in its a configuration ; table  [ table : observe ] summarizes the observations .",
    "the visibility amplitudes were calibrated with observations of , while the visibility phases were calibrated with observations of the vla calibrators and .",

    "a & 332.5 & 6 & 5.6 + 1998 mar . & a & 327.5 & 3 & 5.4 + [ table : observe ]    in this letter we will summarize only salient details of the image processing .",
    "full details of the processing including further details on issues such as radio frequency interference excision , astrometry , bandwidth smearing , and extensive details pertaining to calibration and ionospheric compensation will be provided in @xcite .",
    "observations were taken in spectral - line mode , both to reduce the impact of bandwidth smearing and to enable excision of radio frequency interference .",
    "excision was done manually by searching for visibilities with anomalously high amplitudes , relative to surrounding visibilities in the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane as well as by identifying the fourier components that gave rise to systematic `` ripples '' in the image . in general ,",
    "low - frequency observations with the vla must take the non - coplanarity of the array into account . here",
    "this was not done because the field of view required to image sgr a east and west is sufficiently limited ( @xmath5 ) that the array can be assumed to be nearly coplanar .",
    "several iterations of phase - only self - calibration followed by imaging were performed in order to improve the dynamic range of the images and compensate for ionospheric - induced phase distortions . because data are being combined from different epochs , each epoch was imaged separately to produce an image with an acceptable dynamic range before being combined .",
    "the resulting self - calibrated @xmath3-@xmath4 data from the separate epochs were combined and phase and amplitude calibrated against the 1998 image in order to account for any offset in flux density scales and coordinates grids .    in order to obtain maximum resolution , the super - uniform weighting scheme @xcite was used .",
    "super - uniform weighting reduces the weight , both globally and locally , given to the central , densely sampled region of the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane , maximizing the resolution at the expense of increased noise and sidelobe level . in this case",
    "the increase in noise and sidelobe level is an acceptable trade off , as the analysis is limited more by the @xmath3-@xmath4 coverage and resulting image fidelity than by the thermal noise level .",
    "figure  [ fig : sgrastar ] shows the super - uniform image of the  region .",
    "the expected size of   was calculated from the measurements from 5  to  45  ghz by bower et al .",
    "( 2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "they find the scattering disk of  to be @xmath6 milliarcseconds at @xmath7 cm .",
    "scaling these dimensions by @xmath8 as expected from interstellar scattering gives an expected 330 mhz diameter of @xmath9 arcseconds .",
    "the position angle of the scattering disk of  is constant at @xmath10 over the range of  1.4 to  46  ghz .",
    "we have assumed that its orientation remains constant below  @xmath11  ghz .",
    "has a time averaged flux density at @xmath11  ghz of @xmath12 jy and a time averaged spectral index over the centimeter radio regime of @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "assuming no change in the spectral index below @xmath11  ghz , the expected 330 mhz flux density is roughly 0.4 jy .      figure [ fig : slices ] shows slices through the assumed major and minor axes of .",
    "gaussian fits with baseline subtraction to these slices results in a measured source size of @xmath15 , a peak intensity of 80  @xmath16  15  , and a total flux density of 330  @xmath16 120  mjy .",
    "the source deconvolved with the @xmath17 beam gives a source size of @xmath18 .",
    "if the source is fit in the image instead of fitting slices , , the position angle is then a free parameter instead of assumed to be 80 . a 2 dimensional gaussian fit of the region yields a position angle of @xmath19 .",
    "however , this fit is contaminated by flux density to the south of the source as shown in the slice on the right in figure [ fig : slices ] .",
    "the location and flux density of the source agree with the extrapolations of  [ sec : predict ] , and the size of the source agrees to within @xmath20 along the assumed minor axis and @xmath21 along the assumed major axis .",
    "however , an alternate interpretation of this emission is that it originates from the sgr a east snr .",
    "the absorption in figure [ fig : sgrastar ] is caused by the sgr a west  region , first detected in absorption by pedlar et al .",
    "the sgr a west  region is composed of a dense region known as the `` mini - spiral '' ( lo & claussen 1983 , ekers et al .  1983 ) , known to be orbiting  ( roberts and goss 1993 ) , and a more diffuse ionized region @xmath22 in size , known as sgr a west ( extended ) ( mezger & wink 1986 ; pedlar et al .  1989 ) .",
    "both components of sgr a west are detected in thermal ( free - free ) absorption against the sgr a east snr with 330 mhz optical depths ( @xmath23 ) @xmath24 across a large portion of the  region ( pedlar et al .",
    "the position of  is offset from the mini - spiral ( zhao & goss 1998 ) , therefore in order for sgr  a east to be absorbed at the position of most of the absorption must arise from sgr  a west ( extended ) .",
    "estimates of the optical depth along lines of sight near  based on higher frequency measurements ( @xmath25 ghz , yusef - zadeh & morris  1987 ) suggest that 330 mhz optical depths near  are @xmath26 . moreover , any gap through the sgr  a west  region would have to occur with the size , shape , and location necessary to allow sgr a east to be detected with the expected size , shape , and flux density of .",
    "given the agreement in observed and predicted source properties , the likelihood that sgr  a  east is detected can be discounted .",
    "we conclude that we have detected  at  330  mhz .",
    "previous non - detections at similar frequencies can be attributed to the limited sensitivities of the observations .",
    "davies et al .",
    "( 1976 ) observed with the mk  i - defford interferometer .",
    "this two - element interferometer has a north - south resolution of @xmath27 at  408  mhz .",
    "the correlated flux density that would have been measured by this interferometer is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the scattering diameter and @xmath30 is the intrinsic flux density ( roy et al .",
    "the expected scattering diameter of  is 41 .",
    "their upper limit , @xmath31  mjy , implies that they would not have detected any source weaker than 0.9  jy , a value that is well above the flux density that we have observed at 330 mhz .",
    "pedlar et al .",
    "( 1989 ) observed the galactic center with the vla . at the time of their observations ,",
    "only a few ( @xmath32 ) of the 27 vla antennas were outfitted for 330  mhz observations .",
    "in addition to a higher thermal noise level ( rms sensitivity @xmath33 ) , the number of baselines was substantially lower , resulting in less complete @xmath3-@xmath4 coverage .",
    "would have been only a 3@xmath1 source in a crowded and confusing field .    in 1999 ,",
    "anantharamaiah , pedlar , & goss  reanalyzed data from anantharamaiah et al .",
    "( 1991 ) in which the gc was observed at 330 mhz with all antennas of the vla . in their figure 2 , there is a hint of a detection of  at a level of @xmath34  , which is consistent with this detection .",
    "the authors do not comment on this possible detection .",
    "figure [ fig : spectrum ] shows the observed spectrum for , including our flux density measurement .",
    "this spectrum is not constructed from simultaneous measurements and as  is variable , simultaneous measurements may show differences .",
    "there are at least two models of the low frequency spectrum of  that are suggested by our detection .",
    "either the @xmath35 spectrum observed across the centimeter radio band continues toward low frequencies and the source is unobscured by intervening thermal gas , or the spectrum of  rises below @xmath36 1 ghz and is obscured by significant optical depth .    assuming a @xmath37 spectrum , a 330 mhz optical depth of @xmath38 is required to explain the measured  flux density .",
    "even a flat spectrum below 1.4 ghz permits an optical depth of only @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the free - free optical depth along this line of sight is much less than the @xmath40 35 previously assumed to explain low frequency non - detections ( pedlar et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "a conclusion of  [ sec : ia ] is that lines of sight to sgr  a  east that pass near have large 330 mhz optical depths .",
    "if the line of sight to were similarly obscured , its intrinsic flux density would have to be increasing at low frequencies in order to agree with the observed flux density .",
    "the optical depth has a frequency dependence of @xmath41 . in order to agree with the observed flux density ,",
    "the intrinsic flux density would have to rise exponentially ( @xmath42 ) below @xmath36 1 ghz .",
    "low 330 mhz optical depths near  are also indicated by the 22 ghz , @xmath43 resolution image of the  region by zhao and goss ( 1998 ) , which shows emission measures due to ionized gas within @xmath44 of   are nearly two orders of magnitude lower than in the nearby mini - spiral .",
    "furthermore , an exponential rise in intrinsic flux density to almost exactly cancel the large ( factor of @xmath32 between 1000 and 330 mhz ) increase in free - free optical depth at 330 mhz would be quite improbable .",
    "we conclude that it is likely that there is little or no free - free absorption along the line of sight to , and that the observed flux density is intrinsic to the source .",
    "our results imply a large optical depth towards the sgr  a east snr , but a small optical depth towards .",
    "this could be explained by a localized clearing of the ambient gas accomplished either through the direct influence of the black hole , or through the stellar winds of the central cluster .",
    "it is also possible that the ionized medium in the gc region is clumped , with the line of sight to  passing through a gap .",
    "our data can not differentiate between these possibilities .",
    "previous modeling of the spectrum of  did not have to confront its flux density at low frequencies , as  was thought to be unobservable below 1 ghz ( e.g.  mahadevan 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore , the 410 mhz non - detection of davies et al .",
    "( 1976 ) is often incorrectly treated as an upper limit .",
    "our 330 mhz result and the 610 mhz detection by roy et al .",
    "( 2003 ) require these models to be reevaluated .",
    "because we can not exclude the possibility of free - free optical depth toward sgr a * , our reported 330 mhz flux density should be considered a _",
    "lower _ limit .",
    "advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) models ( e.g.  yuan , markoff & falcke 2002 ) predict flux densities nearly two orders of magnitude lower than the 330 mhz measurement .",
    "the relativistic jet plus adaf model of yuan et al .",
    "( 2002 ) does not explicitly make predictions below @xmath11  ghz , but would appear to closely match the measured 330 mhz flux density . it should be noted that in the jet models , low frequency emission arises from farther out along the jet , probing regions farther from the event horizon .",
    "we have presented a new high resolution , high sensitivity image of the region at  330  mhz , constructed from observations at multiple epochs with the very large array .",
    "we report a detection of , with a flux density of @xmath45  mjy .",
    "previous non - detections of  at comparable frequencies are attributable to the poor sensitivity and/or @xmath3-@xmath4 coverage of the interferometers used .",
    "we argue that only small amounts of free - free absorption ( @xmath46 ) exist along the line of sight to , and therefore that  is observed through a region of low density in the  region .",
    "it is possible that the intrinsic spectrum of  rises below @xmath47 ghz .",
    "however , the intrinsic rise in flux density would have to be balanced by free - free absorption to result in the observed value .",
    "therefore , this flux density measurement is a _",
    "lower _ limit to the intrinsic flux density of this source as the optical depth along the line of sight remains unknown ( e.g. , anantharamaiah et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "this detection at  330  mhz , combined with the recent detection at  610  mhz ( roy et al .",
    "2003 ) , expands the frequency range over which  has been detected and allows for low frequency observational constraints on  emission mechanisms .",
    "future observations at and below  240  mhz with the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) and the low frequency array ( lofar ; kassim et al .  2001 ) may expand the frequency range at which  is detectable to even lower frequencies .",
