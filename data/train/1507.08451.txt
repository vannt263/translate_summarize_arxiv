    "the spreading of correlations and entanglement after a sudden parameter change , investigated by lauchli and kollath  @xcite , and the development of entanglement between the two ends of a chain , analysed by reslen and bose  @xcite , are particularly relevant to the present work .",
    "the quantum correlations necessary to detect inseparability , entanglement and epr steering can in principle be measured using the interaction with light  @xcite , or by homodyning with other atomic modes  @xcite .",
    "we note here that the entanglement we are examining is a collective property between atomic modes which are spatially separated , and is not between individual atoms  @xcite .",
    "we also note that tunneling of atoms between wells will not , by itself , lead to entanglement , with either a nonlinear interaction or initial non - classical states being necessary  @xcite .",
    "what we investigate in this article is the spreading of entanglement and the potential for epr steering along small bose - hubbard chains , beginning with a mesoscopic population of atoms in one end well . in the case of non - interacting atoms and two- or three - well chains",

    "we consider these to be the most suitable approaches here because they are both exact , allow for an easy representation of mesoscopic numbers of atoms , can be used to calculate quantum correlations , and can simulate different quantum initial states  @xcite .",
    "just as importantly , both calculations scale linearly with the number of sites and can in principle deal with any number of atoms .",
    "one disadvantage of the positive - p representation is that the integration can show a tendency to diverge at short times for high collisional nonlinearities  @xcite .",
    "as long as the procedures followed to derive the fokker - planck equation for the positive - p function are valid  @xcite , the stochastic solutions are guaranteed to be accurate wherever the integration converges . with all the results shown here , we found no sign of numerical divergences .",

    "the correlations for an initial fock state however , were seriously affected by the interactions , only following the non - interacting solutions at short times .",
    "some individual correlations which had signalled entanglement or epr steering in the non - interacting case failed to do so once interactions were added . on the other hand , some correlations which failed to attain positive values for initial coherent states did become positive with interactions , although only over small time intervals and with small maximum values . in every case ,",

    "this suggests that if bose - hubbard dynamics are to be used for quantum information purposes , it would be preferable to lower the collisional interactions as far as possible and concentrate on producing non - classical initial states . as the natural state of the atoms in an isolated well is a fock state , this may provide significant advantages .",

    "<S> we investigate how entanglement spreads along small bose - hubbard chains , with only the first well initially occupied by a mesoscopic number of atoms , as the number of sites increases . for two- and three - well chains in the non - interacting case , we are able to obtain analytical solutions and </S>",
    "<S> show that the presence of entanglement depends on having a sub - poissonian state of the atoms in the first well . in these cases , </S>",
    "<S> the correlations we calculate are completely periodic . restoring the collisional interactions or moving to a four - well chain </S>",
    "<S> necessitates a numerical treatment , for which we use the fully quantum positive - p representation . </S>",
    "<S> we examine two different correlations and find that adding collisional interactions destroys the periodicity of the correlations and causes them to degrade with time . </S>",
    "<S> this happens well before there is a noticeable effect on the periodicity of the solutions for the number of atoms in each well . </S>"
