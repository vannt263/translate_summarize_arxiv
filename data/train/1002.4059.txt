    "photolithography is a key process in the production of integrated circuits .",
    "it is the process by which circuit patterns are transferred onto silicon wafers .",
    "a review of this manufacturing technology is given in @xcite .",
    "the main step in photolithography is the creation of a circuit image on the photoresist coating which sits on the silicon layer that is to be patterned .",
    "the image is formed using ultra - violet ( uv ) light which is diffracted by a mask , and refracted by a system of lenses .",
    "the mask simply consists of cut - outs , and lets light through the holes .",
    "the parts of the photoresist that are exposed to the uv light can be removed , leaving openings to the layer to be patterned .",
    "the next stage is etching , which removes material in the layer that is unprotected by the photoresist .",
    "once etching is done , the photoresist can be removed , and the etched away `` channels '' may be filled .",
    "the entire process is illustrated schematically in figure 1 .",
    "the problem we address in this work is the inverse problem of determining what mask is needed in order to remove a desired shape in the photoresist .",
    "the difficulty of producing a desired shape comes from the fact that the uv light is diffracted at the mask .",
    "moreover , the chemicals in the photoresist reacts nonlinearly to uv exposure  only portions of the photoresist that have been exposed to a certain level of intensity are removed in the bleaching process .",
    "the nature of the present work is analytical .",
    "our goal is to formulate mathematically well - posed problems for photolithography .",
    "the methods we use to prove well - posedness are constructive and may serve as a foundation for a computational method .",
    "our investigation into photolithography is inspired by the work of cobb @xcite who was the first to approach this problem from the point of view of optimal design which utilizes a physically - based model .",
    "this general approach was further developed by introducing a level set method in @xcite . a different computational approach which models the mask as a pixelated binary image can be found in @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the first and preliminary section , section  [ model ]",
    ", we develop the most basic model for removal of the exposed photoresist .",
    "we describe the inverse problem to be solved .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the approximate problem whose properties we intend to investigate in this work .",
    "section  [ prelsec ] contains mathematical preliminaries needed for our work .",
    "we introduce the basic notation and recall various results which will be useful for our analysis . in particular , in subsection  [ geomsubsec ] we discuss the geometry of masks or circuits and how to measure the distance between two of them . in section  [ dirsec ]",
    "we discuss the properties of the operator which maps the mask into the circuit .",
    "section  [ approxsec ] provides an analysis of the variational approach to the problem of the optimization of the mask and we prove a convergence result for it , theorem  [ finalteo ] , in the framework of @xmath0-convergence .",
    "this section is separated into three subsections .",
    "first , we review some basic facts about fourier transforms and prove a result about approximation of a gaussian .",
    "we follow this with a discussion of the optics involved and a model for photolithography . in the final subsection",
    "we describe the inverse problem and its approximation .",
    "we first set some notation and describe a few preliminary results .",
    "for every @xmath1 , we shall set @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 . for every @xmath1 and @xmath5 , we shall denote by @xmath6 the open ball in @xmath7 centered at @xmath8 of radius @xmath9 .",
    "usually we shall write @xmath10 instead of @xmath11 .",
    "we recall that , for any set @xmath12 , we denote by @xmath13 its characteristic function , and for any @xmath5 , @xmath14 .    for any @xmath15 , the space of tempered distributions , we denote by @xmath16 its _ fourier transform _ , which , if @xmath17 , may be written as @xmath18 we recall that @xmath19 , that is , when also @xmath20 , @xmath21    if @xmath22 is a radial function , that is @xmath23 for any @xmath24 , then @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the hankel transform of order @xmath27 , @xmath28 being the bessel function of order @xmath27 , see for instance @xcite .",
    "we denote the gaussian distribution by @xmath29 , @xmath24 , and let us note that @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore if @xmath33 denotes the dirac delta centered at @xmath27 , we have @xmath34 , therefore @xmath35 .    for any function @xmath22 defined on @xmath7 and any positive constant @xmath36 ,",
    "we denote @xmath37 , @xmath24 .",
    "we note that @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath31 .",
    "we conclude these preliminaries with the following integrability result for the fourier transform and its applications .",
    "[ intfourierteo ] there exists an absolute constant @xmath40 such that the following estimate holds @xmath41    proof .",
    "this result is contained in theorem a in @xcite and it is based on previous analysis done in @xcite.@xmath42    we recall that a more detailed analysis on conditions for which integrability of the fourier transform holds may be found in @xcite",
    ". however the previous result is simple to use and it is enough for our purposes , in particular for proving the following lemma .",
    "[ approxlemma ] for any @xmath43 there exist a constant @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and a radial function @xmath46 such that @xmath47 on @xmath48 and , if we call @xmath49 , then @xmath50 and @xmath51    proof .",
    "we sketch the proof of this result .",
    "let us consider the following cut - off function @xmath52 such that @xmath53 is nonincreasing , @xmath54 on@xmath55 $ ] and @xmath56 on @xmath57 .",

    "we call @xmath61",
    ".    then lengthy but straightforward computations , with the aid of theorem  [ intfourierteo ] , allow us to prove that for some @xmath44 small enough and for some @xmath62 , with @xmath63 large enough , we have @xmath64    then , let @xmath65 , @xmath1 , so that @xmath66 , or equivalently @xmath67",
    ". therefore @xmath68 by a simple rescaling argument we have that @xmath69 satisfies the required properties .",
    "furthermore , by this construction , we may choose @xmath69 such that it is radially nonincreasing , @xmath47 on @xmath48 and it decays to zero in a suitable smooth , exponential way.@xmath42      we are now in the position to describe the model we shall use .",
    "the current industry standard for modeling the optics is based on kirchhoff approximation . under this approximation ,",
    "the light source at the mask is on where the mask is open , and off otherwise ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "propagation through the lenses can be calculated using fourier optics .",
    "it is further assumed that the image plane , in this case the plane of the photoresist , is at the focal distance of the optical system .",
    "if there were no diffraction , a perfect image of the mask would be formed on the image plane .",
    "diffraction , together with partial coherence of the light source , acts to distort the formed image .",
    "the mask , which we mention consists of cut - outs , is represented as a binary function , i.e. , it is a characteristic function of the cut - outs .",
    "suppose that @xmath70 represents the cut - outs , then the mask is given by @xmath71 the image is the light intensity on the image plane .",
    "this is given by @xcite @xmath72 in the above expression the kernel @xmath73 is called the _ coherent point spread function _ and describes the optical system .",
    "for an optical system with a circular aperture , once the wavenumber of the light used , @xmath74 , has been chosen , the kernel depends on a single parameter called the numerical aperture , @xmath75 .",
    "notice that the wavelength is @xmath76 .",
    "let us recall that the so - called jinc function is defined as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the bessel function of order 1 .",
    "we notice that in the fourier space , see for instance @xcite , @xmath79    if we denote by @xmath80 , then the kernel is usually modeled as follows @xmath81 therefore @xmath82 if @xmath75 goes to @xmath83 , that is @xmath84 , then @xmath85 converges pointwise to @xmath86 , thus @xmath87 approximates in a suitable sense the dirac delta .    for technical reasons , we shall consider a slightly different coherent point spread function @xmath87 .",
    "let us fix a positive constant @xmath88 , to be chosen later .",
    "we shall replace the characteristic function @xmath89 , the fourier transform of the jinc function , with the function @xmath90 , @xmath31 , with @xmath69 and @xmath44 as in lemma  [ approxlemma ] . therefore @xmath91 is a radial function that it is still identically equal to @xmath86 on @xmath92 , it is still compactly supported , it is nonincreasing with respect to the radial variable and it decays to zero in a smooth , exponential way .",
    "its fourier transform is @xmath93 and we shall assume that @xmath94 where again @xmath80 .",
    "also in this model , if @xmath75 goes to @xmath83 , that is @xmath84 , then @xmath85 converges pointwise to @xmath86 , thus @xmath87 approximates in a suitable sense the dirac delta .",
    "the function @xmath95 is called the _ mutual intensity function_. if the illumination is fully coherent , @xmath96 . in practice ,",
    "illumination is never fully coherent and is parametrized by a _ coherency coefficient _ @xmath97 .",
    "a typical model for @xmath98 is @xmath99 thus , @xmath100 that , as @xmath101 , converges , in a suitable sense , to the dirac delta .",
    "therefore full coherence is achieved for @xmath101 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath101 , @xmath98 converges to @xmath86 uniformly on any compact subset of @xmath7 .",
    "the equation ( [ hopkins ] ) is often referred to as the hopkins areal intensity representation . as it will become apparent from the analysis developed in the paper , the value of @xmath36 is related to the scale of details that the manufacturing of the mask allows , thus in turn to the scale of details of the desired circuit .",
    "therefore , we typically consider @xmath102 , that is @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "the photoresist material responds to the intensity of the image .",
    "when intensity at the photoresist goes over a certain threshold , it is then considered exposed and can be removed .",
    "therefore , the exposed pattern , given a mask @xmath105 , is @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the exposure threshold .",
    "clearly , @xmath108 depends on the mask function @xmath105 , which we recall is given by the characteristic function of @xmath70 representing the cut - outs , that is @xmath109 . in photolithography",
    ", we have a desired exposed pattern which we wish to achieve .",
    "the inverse problem is to find a mask that achieves this desired exposed pattern .",
    "mathematically , this can not , in general , be done .",
    "therefore , the inverse problem must be posed as an optimal design problem .",
    "suppose the desired pattern is given by @xmath110 .",
    "we pose the minimization problem @xmath111 the distance function @xmath112 will be discussed in detail below .",
    "the admissible set @xmath113 is our search space , and needs to be defined carefully as well . instead of solving ( [ design_prob ] ) , we pose a variational problem for a function @xmath114 ( instead of the mask @xmath70 )",
    ". we will show below that this problem is well - posed and that as the approximation parameter is set to zero , we recover the solution of ( [ design_prob ] ) under a perimeter penalization .    instead of dealing with the characteristic function @xmath115 which represents the mask",
    ", we will work with a phase - field function @xmath114 which takes on values of 0 and 1 with smooth transitions .",
    "thus , the intensity in ( [ exposed ] ) is calculated with @xmath114 instead of @xmath116 in ( [ hopkins ] ) , so @xmath117 is a function of @xmath114 . at this point",
    ", we will not be precise about the space of functions to which @xmath114 belongs . to force @xmath114 to take on values of mostly 0 and 1",
    ", we introduce the mordica - mortola energy @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a double - well potential .",
    "we will regularize the problem of minimizing the distance between the target pattern and the exposed region by this energy .",
    "then we relax the hard threshold in defining the exposed region @xmath108 in ( [ exposed ] ) .",
    "let @xmath120 be a @xmath121 nondecreasing approximate heaviside function with values @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "the function @xmath124 will be 1 where the intensity @xmath125 .",
    "a sigmoidal threshold function is employed in the computational work in @xcite .",
    "now we consider the distance function between @xmath108 and @xmath110 in ( [ design_prob ] ) .",
    "let @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the characteristic function of the set @xmath108 and @xmath128 is the perimeter of the region @xmath108 . to approximate this distance function , we replace it by @xmath129 the characteristic function of @xmath108 is replaced by the smooth threshold function while its perimeter is replaced by the tv - norm of the function .",
    "the approximate problem we shall solve is @xmath130 the remainder of the paper is an analytical study of this minimization problem .",
    "we will show that it is well - posed , and that in the limit @xmath131 , we recover the solution of the original problem ( [ design_prob ] ) under a perimeter penalization .",
    "by @xmath132 we denote the @xmath86-dimensional hausdorff measure and by @xmath133 we denote the @xmath134-dimensional lebesgue measure .",

    "this kind of argument leads us also to show that @xmath108 shares the same topological properties of @xmath70 , that is for example @xmath108 and @xmath415 have the same number of connected components of @xmath70 and @xmath636 , respectively .",
    "it remains to show the uniform continuity property .",
    "we recall that the operator @xmath637 is hlder continuous from @xmath638 , with the @xmath170 norm , into @xmath639 , with its usual norm .",
    "this means that there exists a constant @xmath640 such that for any @xmath515 and @xmath516 , if we call @xmath641 and @xmath642 , then @xmath643 a simple application of the previous analysis allows us to prove this claim    [ claim1 ] there exists a function @xmath644 , which is continuous , increasing and such that @xmath645 , satisfying the following property .",
    "for any @xmath621 , for any @xmath201 and any @xmath1 we have @xmath646    let us now assume that @xmath515 and @xmath647 belong to @xmath394 and let us fix @xmath201 .",
    "we can find @xmath648 such that if @xmath649 , then @xmath650 .",
    "let us now take @xmath651 , that is @xmath1 such that @xmath652 .",
    "we infer that @xmath653 , therefore by the claim we deduce that @xmath654 .",
    "that is @xmath655 . by symmetry , we conclude that @xmath656 . in other words , the map which to any @xmath621 associates the open set @xmath539 is uniformly continuous with respect to the @xmath395 norm on @xmath394 and the distance @xmath338 . however , we have shown in subsection  [ geomsubsec ] that the distances @xmath337 , @xmath338 , @xmath354 and @xmath355 are topologically equivalent on @xmath403 , to which all @xmath539 belongs , for any @xmath621 .",
    "therefore the map @xmath657 is uniformly continuous with respect to the @xmath395 norm on @xmath394 and any of the distances @xmath337 , @xmath338 , @xmath354 and @xmath355 related to @xmath566 .",
    "we observe that @xmath658 whereas @xmath659 where @xmath336 is here the distance inducing strict convergence in @xmath563 .",
    "therefore we conclude that @xmath660 is uniformly continuous with respect to the @xmath395 norm on @xmath394 and , on @xmath563 , with respect either to the @xmath395 norm or to the @xmath336 distance.@xmath42    let us finally remark that if , instead of taking @xmath661 $ ] , we simply assume @xmath535 , then the same analysis may still be carried over .",
    "clearly we need to change the values of @xmath425 and @xmath662 in proposition  [ firstapproxprop ] , so that they depend on @xmath107 as well . as a consequence also",
    "the quantities introduced in the above theorem  [ mainteo ] would depend on @xmath107 .",
    "throughout this section , we shall keep the notation of theorem  [ mainteo ] and we shall also assume that the hypotheses of theorem  [ mainteo ] are satisfied .",
    "we shall fix @xmath107 , @xmath546 , and @xmath36 , @xmath522 , and we shall take @xmath97 , @xmath552 , and @xmath136 , @xmath620 , @xmath547 and @xmath549 as in theorem  [ mainteo ] .",
    "we call @xmath110 the circuit to be reconstructed and we shall assume that it belongs to @xmath323 .",
    "we recall that , by proposition  [ compactprop ] , @xmath325 is compact with respect to the @xmath354 distance , which corresponds to the distance induced by the @xmath395 norm for the corresponding characteristic functions .",
    "then it is an immediate consequence of the last part of theorem  [ mainteo ] , see also remark  [ ossimp ] , that the problem @xmath663 admits a solution .",
    "we note that @xmath543 and that here @xmath355 is the distance defined in ( [ d3def ] ) related to @xmath566 .    from a numerical point of view",
    ", the class @xmath325 is rather difficult to handle .",
    "we try to reduce this difficulty by enlarging the class @xmath325 to a class of characteristic functions of sets with finite perimeter . in order to keep the lower semicontinuity of the functional , we restrict ourselves to characteristic functions of sets with finite perimeter which are contained in @xmath394 .",
    "namely , we define the following functional @xmath664 $ ] such that for any @xmath501 we have @xmath665 where @xmath666 is the functional defined in ( [ pdef ] ) with @xmath139 chosen to be @xmath468 , @xmath667 is a positive parameter and @xmath336 is the strict convergence distance in @xmath563 .",
    "we recall that , whenever @xmath668 almost everywhere in @xmath468 and @xmath669 , then @xmath670 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath671 , and consequently also @xmath672 , is equal to @xmath83 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath557 , in particular if @xmath542 for some @xmath569 , then @xmath673 , where again @xmath355 is the distance defined in ( [ d3def ] ) related to @xmath566 .",
    "we look for the solution to the following minimization problem @xmath674 we notice that such a minimization problem admits a solution . even if the class @xmath394 might still be not very satisfactory to handle from a numerical point of view , since it somehow involves handling the class @xmath325 , we believe that from a practical point of view such a restriction might be dropped and we might use the class @xmath675 instead .",
    "in fact , we have a good initial guess , given by the target circuit @xmath676 , and it is reasonable to assume that the optimal mask will be a rather small perturbation of @xmath110 itself .",
    "in fact , under our assumptions , by the arguments developed in the proof of theorem  [ mainteo ] , we can show that @xmath539 has the same topological properties of @xmath70 , where @xmath677 is the element of @xmath325 which is closest to @xmath114 .",
    "therefore if we look for a set @xmath539 as close as possible to @xmath110 , then at least we need to require that the set @xmath70 has the same topological properties of @xmath110 . for this reason and since @xmath678 , it might be essentially the same to perform the minimization in a small neighbourhood of @xmath325 or in the whole @xmath638 . on the other hand , again by our assumptions , we notice that whenever the boundary of @xmath110 presents a corner , and this is often case , as @xmath679 is often the union of a finite number of segments , then @xmath110 can not be reconstructed in an exact way , since @xmath539 , for any @xmath621 , is a @xmath399 set , thus its boundary can not have any corner .",
    "besides dealing with the class @xmath394 , there are several other difficulties .",
    "in particular , computing @xmath680 for some @xmath681 is not an easy task , since it involves at least the computation of the perimeters of @xmath172 and of @xmath682 .",
    "furthermore , solving a minimization problem in the class of sets of finite perimeter is not a straightforward task from the numerical point of view .    in order to solve these difficulties , we use the following strategy .",
    "we approximate , in the sense of @xmath0-convergence , the functional @xmath683 with a family of functional @xmath684 which are easier to compute numerically and are defined on a set of smooth functions .    as in section 2.3",
    ", we take a @xmath121 function @xmath685 such that @xmath53 is nondecreasing , @xmath686 for any @xmath687 and @xmath688 for any @xmath689 . for",

    "the continuity property of @xmath696 immediately follows by the continuity of @xmath637 and by the properties of @xmath53 .",
    "we just note that the hlder exponent is fixed , whereas the hlder constant might depend upon @xmath694 .    about the convergence result , we begin by recalling that @xmath699 , @xmath621 .",
    "we use claim  [ claim1 ] introduced in the proof of theorem  [ mainteo ] .",

    "we call @xmath702\\to [ 0,s_0]$ ] the continuous , increasing function which is the inverse of @xmath263 on such intervals . for any @xmath694 , @xmath703",
    ", we infer that @xmath704 might be different from @xmath705 only if @xmath706 . by estimates like ( [ length ] ) and ( [ neigh ] ) , which are independent of @xmath621",
