    "within the fundamentals of magnetism we read in textbooks that the magnetic order in solids below a critical temperature , like ferro- , ferri- or antiferromagnetism , is characterized by a microscopic arrangement of atomic magnetic moments . in order to account for ferromagnetism one",
    "needs , for example , an exchange interaction of electrostatic origin between localized magnetic moments of neighboring atoms or , in case of itinerant electron magnetism , an effective exchange energy for the unpaired , no longer localized electrons . within these basic ,",
    "well accepted concepts , magnetic order was  recognized \" only for materials with 3@xmath0 or 4@xmath1 electrons . however , since 1991 we know that some organic molecules with unpaired @xmath2-electrons show magnetic order at temperatures @xmath3k , without having any metallic ions @xcite .",
    "we note also that antiferromagnetic order in a @xmath4-electron system has been found below a nel temperature of @xmath5k @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of any law of physics that prohibits the existence of magnetic order in systems with only @xmath4-electrons and at temperatures above room temperature .",
    "not long time ago , carbon - based structures were basically accepted to be diamagnetic or , in special cases , paramagnetic .",
    "any ferromagnetic - like signal was assumed to be due to magnetic impurities .",
    "no doubt , impurities are a problem when the  intrinsic \" magnetic signals are relatively small",
    ". however , it appears that instead of trying to study systematically the contribution of these impurities to the magnetic signals , the strategy of  minimum work \" based on prejudices was chosen , indirectly neglecting the existence of interesting magnetic phenomena in carbon structures . in this article",
    "we will review some recently published results that indicate that we are at the beginning of our understanding of the magnetism in carbon - based materials .",
    "usually , a diamagnetic signal is measured in relatively ordered carbon - based structures .",
    "the best example is oriented graphite , which shows a large diamagnetic susceptibility . measurements of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite samples with rocking curve width at half maximum fwhm @xmath6 provide a value for the susceptibility @xmath7emu / goe at 300  k and for fields applied parallel to the @xmath8axis ( perpendicular to the graphene planes ) .",
    "the large diamagnetism stems from  fast - moving \" electrons @xcite with a small effective mass @xmath9 ( here @xmath10 is the free electron mass ) . within a tight - binding picture",
    "the small effective mass is due to the large @xmath2-bonding overlap of the neighboring c - atoms in a single layer given by the band parameter @xmath11 . for the calculation of @xmath12 the linear dispersion relation for two - dimensional ( 2d ) graphene @xmath13",
    "was assumed @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , properties of massless  dirac \" fermions are rediscovered nowadays in the literature and are thought to play also a role in the observed metal - insulator - like transition in the electrical resistivity @xcite . the main contribution to the @xmath14dependence of @xmath15 at @xmath16k",
    "is given by @xmath17 ( @xmath1 is the fermi - dirac distribution function ) due to the condensation of fermions into the landau level with @xmath18 after the application of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "although experimental results are in general in agreement with this theory , to explain the saturation of @xmath15 at low @xmath19 a series of additional band parameters has to be included ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "we note , however , that this further developed theory does not account for the measured anisotropy of the @xmath20-factors @xcite , a disagreement that , to our knowledge , has not been solved yet .",
    "moreover , high resolution magnetization measurements in different hopg samples indicate that @xmath12 has a shallow but well - defined and field dependent minimum at @xmath21k ( as an example see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) in agreement with that reported in @xcite .",
    "this minimum is not due to magnetic impurities .",
    "the origin for this minimum is not yet clarified and no attempt has been done to check whether it is compatible with more elaborate theories for the diamagnetism in graphite .    due to the available sample quality",
    ", the measurement of the anisotropy in the carrier diamagnetism of graphite is difficult .",
    "taking into account recent measurements of the electrical anisotropy that indicates a ratio ( parallel to perpendicular to the @xmath8axis ) of the order of or larger than @xmath22 for well ordered samples , we expect to have a susceptibility @xmath23 smaller than the atomic susceptibility of carbon in graphite , which is of the order of @xmath24emu / goe according to literature .",
    "we have also to take internal misalignments of the crystallites in the sample into account . at room temperature and for a sample with fwhm @xmath25 , due to the @xmath26 component a value of the order of @xmath27emu / goe @xmath28",
    "would be measured for fields applied nominally parallel to the planes .",

    "its diamagnetic susceptibility at 300 k is a factor three smaller than @xmath26 for hopg .",
    "the data for the disordered carbon material indicate a curie - like dependence added to a pauli - like contribution .",

    "[ fig1 ] shows the field dependence of the magnetization for the carbon film material at 5  k. these data can be described by the usual langevin expression from which we obtain a spin density @xmath33  g@xmath34 .",

    "the observed behavior with annealing is not in favour of a magnetic impurity contribution .    within experimental error",
    "the hysteresis loops for the disordered carbon films above 5  k are reversible .",
    "this indicates that a disordered mixture of sp@xmath37-sp@xmath38 bonds , which exists in the disordered carbon films , does not trigger automatically ferromagnetism .",
    "the overall behavior as well as the spin density obtained for the disordered films prepared by pld are very similar to those obtained for activated carbon fibers @xcite , results interpreted in terms of antiferromagnetically interacting spins from @xmath2-electrons originated at the edges of nanographite layers .",
    "one may doubt , however , on the existence of edge states of graphene layers in disordered carbon films .",
    "we note , however , that amorphous - like carbon prepared from targets with a large hydrogen / carbon ratio was reported to be ferromagnetic with a magnetization at saturation as large as 2  emu / g at room temperature @xcite .",
    "there is a relatively large list of reports on organic ferromagnets since in 1991 two metal - ion free compounds with curie temperatures of 0.65  k @xcite and 16  k @xcite were discovered .",
    "however , the research on the possible magnetic order in carbon - based structures appears to be older ; for a recent review on magnetism in carbon - based materials in which most of the old work is included as well as a list of recent references on organic magnets , see @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we would like to point out a few experimental facts that indicate the intrinsic , impurity free origin of the ferromagnetism in carbon structures with a curie temperature above room temperature .",
    "a systematic and full characterization of the magnetic impurity content in each of the samples is of primary importance and absolutely necessary .",
    "part of the reason for the weak interest attracted by the ferromagneticlike hysteresis loops found in hopg samples @xcite as well as by older publications on magnetic carbon is probably due to unclear impurity characterization .",
    "to improve this situation radically we have used the method of  particle induced x - ray emission \" ( pixe ) for the impurity characterization . having a carbon matrix , this method reaches a sensitivity of @xmath39ppm for all magnetic metallic impurities and therefore is very convenient for all relevant impurity analysis , prior and after any further characterization with mfm and squid and sample handling .",

    "it allows simultaneously proton irradiation and element analysis ( using the same protons ) . in comparison with the broad - beam ,",
    "the micro - beam has the advantage that enables us to make a detailed element map of the sample within a depth of @xmath41 m and check for inhomogeneous distributions of impurities .",

    "figure  [ fig2](a ) shows that the magnetization at 2  koe , after substraction of background contributions , does not show a correlation with the fe - concentration .",

    "[ fig2](a ) . except for three hopg samples the other show magnetization values below the ones expected from those fe - lines .",
    "this figure clearly shows how small the ferromagnetic signals are that we are working with , as well as how much care is needed for the sample handling in all these studies . however , the assumption that such a small amount of fe distributed in the carbon matrix behaves ferromagnetically is neither consistent with the behavior we observed in graphite samples with much larger fe concentrations @xcite , nor with the recently obtained @xmath19-dependent , paramagnetic behavior in fe irradiated graphite @xcite nor in , e.g. , 4@xmath51 metals , where paramagnetism as well as spin glass behaviors are measured for fe concentrations of @xmath52ppm or larger @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig2](b ) shows two hysteresis loops for a hopg sample .",
    "we note that in this field range no sign of diamagnetism is measured but a paramagnetic behavior added to the hysteresis .",
    "this is one of some fortuitous cases where the diamagnetic component is small enough due to the small misalignment of the sample in the squid . the observed behavior in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is in clear contrast with the t - dependent paramagnetic contribution measured in samples with a larger amount of fe - impurities @xcite.the reason for the temperature independent ( between 5 and 300  k ) pauli - like paramagnetism is probably related to the intrinsic lattice disorder as in disordered carbon samples ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] belong to a relatively disordered hopg sample with fwhm@xmath53 and a pauli - like susceptibility @xmath54emu / goe , smaller than that obtained for disordered carbon @xmath55emu / goe @xcite .",
    "we expect that by increasing the lattice disorder a curie - like paramagnetic contribution will appear .",
    "the overall results including those discussed in sec .  [ proton ] suggest that special lattice disorder _ and _ the influence of a light atom like hydrogen may be the origin for the observed ferromagnetism .",
    "recent density functional calculations indicate that h adsorption on vacancy dangling bonds gives rise to a localized magnetic moment of the order of @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "if these defects or just h - atoms at edge states can spin polarize the flat bands of graphite @xcite , then not fe but a few tens of ppm h might be enough to trigger the magnetic order we observe .",
    "we stress that the ferromagnetic - like signal as well as the paramagnetism observed in hopg are sample dependent .",
    "we expect that rather perfect samples annealed at high enough temperatures @xmath57c ) and cooled down in high vacuum should show weaker ferro- and/or paramagnetic signals .",
    "measurements on pure , specially annealed graphite powder @xcite support this expectation .",

    "polymerization of c@xmath59 at temperatures and pressures near the cage collapse and graphitization of the anisotropic 2d rhombohedral rh - c@xmath59 phase leads to ferromagnetism with @xmath64k @xcite . in general",
    ", the total concentration of magnetic impurities reported in those studies appears to be too low to give rise to the observed magnetization .",
    "nevertheless , we need further evidence that supports a magnetic impurity independent ordering .",
    "we note that in c@xmath59h@xmath62 the initial ferromagnetic state strongly weakens after one year of storage , a result unlikely to come from magnetic impurities @xcite .",
    "measurements done on different polymerized samples with different fe - concentration ( up to 400@xmath65g / g ) show very similar magnetization behavior ( magnetization at saturation @xmath66a / m @xmath67emu / g ) .",
    "this fact as well as the influence of heat treatment on the magnetic behavior @xcite do not favour an interpretation in terms of magnetic impurities .",
    "furthermore , the small variation of remanence and coercivity with temperature gives no indication for magnetism of small particles , a behavior similar to that observed in different magnetic carbon - based structures including hopg .",
    "magnetic force microscopy measurements performed in two polymerized fullerenes could resolve well defined magnetic domains @xcite .",
    "these magnetic domains were obtained in a region where the magnetic impurity concentration was less than @xmath68g / g as characterized by pixe measurements @xcite .",
    "these studies also showed that only @xmath69 of the pure sample area was magnetic , a result that speaks for the inhomogeneous character of the ferromagnetism and against a strong correlation between the magnetic ordering and rhombohedral structure .",
    "recently published band structure calculations of rh - c@xmath59 performed in the local - spin - density approximation found no magnetic solution for rh - c@xmath59 and energy bands with different spins are found to be identical and not split , concluding that the rhombohedral distortion of c@xmath59 itself can not induce magnetic ordering in polymerized fullerene @xcite .",
