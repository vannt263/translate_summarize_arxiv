    "the pair potential is composed of spin and orbital wave functions .",
    "the orbital wave function is characterized by its amplitude and phase ( sign of the wave function ) . in the past decade , experimental techniques for the field - angle resolved specific heat and thermal conductivity measurements have developed to identify the cooper pairing symmetry in various superconducting systems.@xcite these angle - resolved mesurements are powerful techniques that can detect the anisotropy of the pair potential amplitude . the theory proposed by vorontsov and vekhter",

    "that is , they are not phase - sensitive probes .",
    "in addition to detecting the anisotropy of the pair potential , it is crucial to probe the phase of the cooper pair in order to discriminate unconventional scs , including iron - based scs , from conventional ones .    until now",
    ", only a few phase - sensitive probes have been developed and succeeded , e.g. , the half - flux quantum observation in the tricrystal geometry by a scanning squid ( superconducting quantum interference device ) microscope,@xcite and detecting the quasiparticle interference pattern by scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts).@xcite another phase - sensitive probe is measuring bound states at an interface by point - contact spectroscopy or sts experiments . if both sides of a sc / sc junction are of the same pair potential amplitude but with opposite signs , the quasiparticle ( qp ) path through the interface acquires a @xmath4 phase shift and generating bound states around the interface .",
    "this situation is similar to a vortex line in superconductors .",
    "however , there is the difficulty of fabricating a junction in terms of nono - structured processing techniques .",
    "actually , the phase - sensitive test using sc / sc junctions succeeds only for cuprate superconductors.@xcite in addition to these existing experiments , a new phase - sensitive test is highly desired .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new experiment that can detect the phase ( sign - change ) of the pair potential free from fabricating a sc / sc junction .",
    "this is the great advantage of the phase - sensitive test proposed in the present work .",
    "we theoretically study the in - plane field - angle dependence of the flux - flow resistivity @xmath0 for typical gap functions and fermi surface ( fs ) . from our numerical calculations , we show that the phase - sensitive qp scattering inside a vortex core leads to different behavior of @xmath0 between conventional and unconventional cooper pairing .",

    "these two pair potentials have the same anisotropy in their amplitude @xmath67 . however , only the @xmath3-wave pair has the sign change and the @xmath60-wave pair does not .",

    "p70mmp70 mm +    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ table:1 ]",
    "first of all , we consider @xmath6 , which is a part of the contribution to @xmath1 as shown in eq .. in the case of the line - node @xmath60-wave pair , taking into account the characteristics of the qp scattering ( i )  ( iii ) , we can explain qualitatively the behavior of @xmath72 . in the line - node @xmath60-wave pair , @xmath72 has its minimum when @xmath28 is applied to the gap - node direction @xcite . in this case",
    ", according to the factor ( iii ) , the effect of the coherence factor on @xmath73 is small .",
    "in addition , in the line - node @xmath60-wave pair , we confirmed that the coherence factor has no field - angle dependence .",
    "hence , we can neglect the factor ( iii ) in the line - node @xmath60-wave pair .    when @xmath28 is parallel to the gap - node direction , the weight of @xmath73 shifts toward the field direction ( i.e. , the gap - node direction ) due to the factor ( ii ) .",
    "therefore , the qps around the gap node become easier to be scattered .",
    "however , according to the factor ( i ) , the contribution of the qps in the vicinity of the gap nodes to @xmath73 is small .",
    "hence , the large contribution to @xmath73 due to the factor ( ii ) gets small due to the factor ( i ) .    on the other hand , when @xmath28 is parallel to the anti - node direction , the qps in the direction of @xmath28 ( i.e. ,  the anti - node direction ) , which have small @xmath74 , can give a large contribution to @xmath73 due to the factor ( ii ) .",
    "in this case , contrary to the case of @xmath28 parallel to the node direction , @xmath6 remains large due to the factor ( i ) . as a result of the above consideration",
    ", the minimum of @xmath72 appears when @xmath28 is parallel to the gap - node direction .",
    "p70 mm    in the case of the @xmath3-wave pair , the backward scattering is suppressed ( see table  [ table:1 ] ) since the coherence factor becomes zero and the scattering point is far from the vortex core . however , the forward scattering with the sign change of pair potential is enhanced ( see table  [ table:1 ] ) .",
    "so the coherence factor gives the large contribution to @xmath73 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , we show the field - angle dependences of @xmath75 , which is the part of @xmath76 containing the coherence factor @xmath77 .",
    "we also calculate the field - angle dependences of @xmath78 , which does not contain the coherence factor .",
    "when @xmath28 is parallel to the node direction , @xmath79 shows a sharp maximum . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath78 shows little field - angle dependence .",
    "this sharp maximum reproduces the behavior of @xmath72 in the @xmath3-wave case.@xcite    let us explain the physical picture of the qp scattering rate in the @xmath3-wave case .",
    "first of all , we should note that the intensity of the forward scattering is the important factor of the qp scattering around a vortex , since the forward scatterings occur when the scattering point is near the vortex center ( i.e. , the qp scattering occurs inside a vortex core ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "thus , we consider the field - angle dependence of the intensity of the forward scattering .",
    "we note that the intensity of the forward scattering becomes larger upon decreasing the effective coherence length @xmath39 .",
    "the effective coherence length @xmath39 defined by eq .   is proportional to the projected fermi velocity @xmath80 and is inversely proportional to the amplitude of a pair potential @xmath81 .",
    "the minimum effective coherence length is zero when the fermi velocity @xmath82 is parallel to @xmath28 [ i.e. , @xmath80 becomes zero ] .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , the intensity of @xmath83 becomes large in the region where @xmath80 becomes small .",
    "this is the reason for the factor ( ii ) .",
    "the most important factor of the intensity of the forward scattering is the factor ( iii ) .",
    "as shown in table  [ table:1 ] , the sign - conserved forward scattering is suppressed even when the effective coherence length becomes small .",
    "therefore , the sign - reversed forward scatterings with the small effective coherence length dominantly contribute to the qp scattering rate in the @xmath3-wave case .",
    "when @xmath28 is parallel to the gap - node direction , we have confirmed numerically that the forward scattering is realized by calculating the contribution of anti - nodal qps to @xmath84 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] , the forward scattering occurs through the qp scattering in the parallel direction of @xmath28 when @xmath28 is parallel to the gap - node direction .",
    "moreover , this qp scattering process is sign - reversing , since the quasiparticles with @xmath56 are scattered across the gap - node perpendicular to @xmath28 .",
    "hence , the sign - reversed forward scattering occurs when @xmath28 is parallel to the gap - node direction even in a single - band superconductor .    on the other hand , when @xmath28 is parallel to the anti - node direction , it was revealed through the same analysis that although the sign - reversed scattering occurs , not only the forward scattering but also the backward scattering occurs . as a result of the above discussion , the quasiparticle scattering rate is enhanced when @xmath28 is parallel to the gap - node direction in the @xmath3-wave case .",
    "p50 mm +    the other contribution to @xmath1 is @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath85 , the field angle dependence of @xmath7 for a spheroidal fs is not qualitatively different from that for an isotropic fs.@xcite when @xmath86 , @xmath87 . in the @xmath3-wave case",
    ", the dependence of @xmath7 on the field - angle makes the behavior of @xmath72 stand out . as a result",
    ", @xmath0 has a sharp maximum when @xmath28 is parallel to the gap - node direction . on the other hand , in the @xmath60-wave case , the field angle dependence of @xmath7 makes the oscillation amplitude of @xmath72 inverted and @xmath0 has its broad maximum when @xmath28 is parallel to the gap - node direction .",
    "finally , we comment on the experimental condition for measuring the flux - flow resistivity under a rotating magnetic field .",
    "our theory is based on the vortex bound states formed inside a vortex core .",
    "therefore , an extremely two - dimensional system , in which a josephson vortex is formed parallel to the layer , is beyond our theoretical framework .",
    "however , we should note that our method can be applied to iron - pnictides , which have a warped cylindrical fermi surface such as that found in 11-compounds ( fese or fete ) and 122-compounds [ bafe@xmath88(as@xmath89p@xmath90)@xmath88 ] , since the angular - resolved specific heat and thermal conductivity measurements have successfully detected the gap minima in fese@xmath92te@xmath93 @xcite and the position of the gap - nodes in bafe@xmath88(as@xmath94p@xmath95)@xmath88,@xcite respectively , under a rotated magnetic field within the basal plane . in layered organic compounds @xmath96-(et)@xmath88cu(ncs)@xmath88 , in - plane field angular dependence of the josephson - vortex flow resistance",
    "has already been measured by yasuzuka _",
    "et al_.,@xcite but in a three - dimensional system , measurement of the flux - flow resistivity has not been performed yet .",
    "we calculate @xmath0 also in the case of the in - plane anisotropic fs.@xcite in this case , the behavior of @xmath0 is not qualitatively different from that in the isotropic fs case .",
    "when considering multiband superconductors such as iron - based superconductors , we need to take into account the contribution from holelike fs to the flux - flow resistivity in addition to that from electronlike fs.@xcite in this study , we consider the contribution only from electronlike fs . the multiband effect on the flux - flow resistivity is left for future study .",
    "in conclusion , we theoretically studied the in - plane magnetic field - angle dependence of the flux - flow resistivity for a uniaxially anisotropic fs . we showed that the measurement of the flux - flow resistivity changing the field direction within the @xmath43-@xmath44 plane can detect both the position of the gap nodes and the sign change of the pairing potential .",
    "one can estimate the flux - flow resistivity by means of microwaves . instead of fabricating a junction , one can obtain the information on the phase of the pair potential by measuring the microwave surface impedance under a rotating magnetic field .",
