    "an ultracold fermi gas is well known as a system with high tunability of various physical parameters@xcite .",
    "for example , one can experimentally tune the strength of a pairing interaction associated with a feshbach resonance .",
    "this has enabled us to systematically study how superfluid properties continuously change from the weak - coupling bcs ( bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ) -type to the bec ( bose - einstein condensation ) of tightly bound molecular boson with increasing the interaction strength , which is also referred to as the bcs - bec crossover in the literature . in the crossover region ,",
    "pairing fluctuations are expected to be strong near the superfluid phase transition temperature @xmath2 , so that the so - called pseudogap phenomenon has been discussed there@xcite .",
    "another example of the high tunability is the realization of a low dimensional fermi gas by using an optical lattice technique .",
    "since pairing fluctuations are enhanced by the low dimensionality of the system , together with the tunable pairing interaction , this is also use for the study of strong - coupling physics in a systematic manner .",
    "in particular , two - dimensional fermi gases have recently attracted much attention in this field@xcite , because the quasi - long - range superfluid order , called the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) phase is expected there@xcite .",
    "indeed , various physical quantities , such as photoemission spectra@xcite , as well as thermodynamic quantities@xcite , have been measured in this system , and the observation of bkt transition has recently been reported in a two - dimensional @xmath1li fermi gas@xcite .    in the three - dimensional case ,",
    "a ( non - self - consistent ) @xmath0-matrix approximation ( the detail of which is explained in sec .",
    "2 ) has been extensively used to successfully explain various interesting phenomena observed in the bcs - bec crossover region @xcite . in this regard , however , when tma is applied to the two - dimensional case , while it is valid for the strong - coupling regime , it overestimates strong - coupling effects in the weak - coupling regime@xcite .",
    "for example , tma does not give free - particle density of states even in the weak - coupling regime , when the pairing interaction is very weak .",
    "thus , in the current stage of research , it is a crucial theoretical issue to improve tma so that one can correctly deal with the weak - coupling regime .    in this paper , we show that the self - consistent @xmath0-matrix approximation ( sctma ) , which involves higher - order pairing fluctuations than tma , meets our demand . within this framework ,",
    "we clarify how the so - called pseudogap phenomenon disappears in a two - dimensional fermi gas as one approaches the weak - coupling regime from the strong - coupling side . comparing sctma results with tma ones",
    ", we also discuss the reason why the above mentioned problem in tma can be eliminated in sctma .    throughout this paper",
    ", we take @xmath3 and the two - dimensional system area is taken to be unity , for simplicity .",

    "the self - energy @xmath33 in the non - self - consistent @xmath0-matrix approximation ( tma ) is given by replacing all the the dressed green s functions in the sctma @xmath25 by the free fermi green s functions @xmath34 , as shown in fig .",

    "because of this simplification , in contrast to sctma , strong coupling corrections to fermi single - particle excitations , as well as the resulting pseudogap phenomenon , are completely ignored in evaluating the tma particle - particle scattering matrix @xmath38 .",
    "we will show how this ignorance leads to the overestimation of the pseudogap phenomenon in the weak - coupling case when @xmath39 .    in both sctma and tma ,",
