    "here is a description of the basics of genus two r - r diagrams , which is all we need .",
    "suppose @xmath40 is a closed orientable surface of genus two obtained by capping off the two boundary components of an annulus @xmath41 with a pair of once - punctured tori @xmath42 and @xmath43 , so that @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "following zieschang @xcite , the separating simple closed curves @xmath47 and @xmath48 in @xmath40 are _ belt _ curves , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are _ handles_.    if @xmath49 is a set of pairwise disjoint simple closed curves in @xmath40 , then , after isotopy , we may assume each curve @xmath50 is either disjoint from @xmath51 , or @xmath52 is cut by its intersections with @xmath53 into arcs , each properly embedded and essential in one of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",

    "a collection of pairwise disjoint connections on a given handle can be partitioned into _ bands _ of pairwise parallel connections . since",
    "each handle is a once - punctured torus , there can be at most three nonparallel bands of connections on a given handle .    note that sets of pairwise nonparallel connections in a once - punctured torus are unique up to homeomorphism . in particular , if @xmath2 and @xmath54 are once - punctured tori , @xmath55 , is a set of pairwise nonparallel connections in @xmath2 , and @xmath56 , @xmath57 is a set of pairwise nonparallel connections in @xmath54 , then there is a homeomorphism @xmath58 which takes @xmath59 to @xmath60 .    in practice ,",
    "it is often inconvenient to have curves in @xmath49 that lie completely in @xmath42 or @xmath43 . this situation can be avoided by relaxing the supposition that each curve in @xmath49 has only essential intersections with the belt curves @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "then , if a curve @xmath50 lies completely in @xmath42 or @xmath43 , say @xmath43 , @xmath52 can be isotoped in @xmath40 so that @xmath61 consists of one properly embedded essential arc , while @xmath62 is an inessential arc in @xmath41 , isotopic in @xmath41 into @xmath48 , keeping its endpoints fixed .",
    "( in the r - r diagrams of this paper , the curve @xmath15 is always displayed in this manner . )",
    "some simplifications can be made at this point without losing any information about the embedding of the curves of @xmath49 in @xmath40 .",
    "for example , suppose @xmath2 is either @xmath42 or @xmath43 , and let @xmath63 be the set of arcs in which curves of @xmath49 intersect @xmath41 .",
    "then each set of parallel connections on @xmath2 can be merged into a single connection .",
    "( this also merges some endpoints of arcs in @xmath63 meeting @xmath64 . )    after such mergers , @xmath2 carries at most @xmath65 pairwise nonparallel connections .",
    "continuing , after each set of parallel connections on @xmath42 and @xmath43 has been merged , additional mergers of sets of properly embedded parallel subarcs of @xmath63 can also be made ; although now whenever , say , @xmath66 parallel arcs are merged into one , this needs to be recorded by placing the integer @xmath66 near the single arc resulting from the merger .",
    "merging parallel connections in @xmath42 and @xmath43 turns the set of pairwise disjoint simple closed curves in @xmath49 into a graph @xmath67 in @xmath40 whose vertices are the endpoints of the remaining connections in @xmath42 and @xmath43 . clearly @xmath67 and its embedding in @xmath40 completely encodes the embedding of the curves of @xmath49 in @xmath40 .",
    "understanding @xmath67 and the curves of @xmath49 it represents is complicated by the fact that @xmath67 is usually nonplanar .",
    "however , @xmath67 always has a nice immersion @xmath68 in the plane @xmath69 , which we now describe .",
    "it is this immersion of @xmath67 in @xmath69 which becomes an r - r diagram of the curves of @xmath49 in @xmath40 .    to produce @xmath68 ,",
    "first remove a small disk @xmath6 , disjoint from @xmath67 , from the interior of @xmath41 .",
    "then embed @xmath70 in @xmath69 so that @xmath47 and @xmath48 bound disjoint round disks , say @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively , in @xmath69 .",
    "next , note that if @xmath73 and @xmath74 are nonparallel connections on a handle @xmath75 , with @xmath76 , the endpoints of @xmath73 separate the endpoints of @xmath74 in the belt curve @xmath77 .",
    "it follows that , if @xmath78 and @xmath79 in @xmath77 are the endpoints of a connection @xmath73 in @xmath75 , we may assume @xmath78 and @xmath79 bound a diameter @xmath80 of the disk @xmath81 , and then @xmath73 can be embedded in @xmath81 as the diameter @xmath80 of @xmath81 .",
    "this results in each round disk @xmath81 containing @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , or @xmath65 diameters passing through its center @xmath85 , with each diameter an image of a connection in @xmath75 , where the number of such diameters depends upon whether @xmath75 originally contained respectively @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , or @xmath65 bands of parallel connections .",
    "also note that the immersion @xmath68 still encodes the embedding of the curves in @xmath49 in @xmath40 up to homeomorphism .",
    "this follows from the aforementioned fact that if @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 are each sets of pairwise nonparallel connections in a once - punctured torus @xmath2 , then there is a homeomorphism of @xmath2 which takes @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "the partition of @xmath40 into @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 makes it easy to describe infinite families of parametrized embeddings of the curves of @xmath49 in the boundary of a genus two handlebody .",
    "to do this , consider @xmath40 as 2-sided , with sides @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and suppose the curves of @xmath49 lie in @xmath86 . then gluing a pair of disks @xmath17 and @xmath18 to @xmath87",
    "so that @xmath88 is glued to a nonseparating simple closed curve in @xmath89 , @xmath90 is glued to a nonseparating simple closed curve in @xmath91 , and the resulting 2-sphere boundary component is capped off with a 3-ball , makes @xmath40 the boundary of a genus two handlebody @xmath3 .",
    "continuing , note that if @xmath73 and @xmath74 are two nonparallel oriented connections in a once - punctured torus @xmath2 , then the isotopy class of an oriented nonseparating simple closed curve @xmath92 in @xmath2 is determined by its algebraic intersection numbers with @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this makes it possible to parametrize the isotopy classes of attaching curves of @xmath88 and @xmath90 in @xmath42 and @xmath43 by adding integer labels to the endpoints of the diameters of @xmath71 and @xmath72 which represent connections in @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "( there are minor restrictions on the values of these parameters ; all related to similar restrictions on meridional and longitudinal coordinates of simple closed curves in @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is a solid torus .",
    "figure [ dispcfig6a ] illustrates these . )    in practice , given a set of curves @xmath49 in the boundary of a genus two handlebody @xmath3 , we usually reverse the order in which the partition of @xmath5 into @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 and a complete set of cutting disks @xmath10 are chosen by choosing a desired set of cutting disks @xmath10 first , and then choosing an appropriate compatible partition of @xmath5 into @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "[ 3 case theorem ] suppose @xmath3 is a genus two handlebody , and @xmath4 and @xmath15 are a pair of disjoint nonparallel simple closed curves in @xmath5 such that both @xmath4 and @xmath15 are primitive in @xmath3 .",
    "then @xmath4 and @xmath15 have an r - r diagram with the form of figure _ [ dispcfig1a ] _ , _ [ dispcfig2a ] _ or _ [ dispcfig3a]_.    recall that if @xmath92 is a primitive simple closed curve in the boundary of a genus two handlebody @xmath3 , then there is a unique cutting disk of @xmath3 ( up to isotopy ) disjoint from @xmath92 , while there are an infinite number of cutting disks of @xmath3 that intersect @xmath92 transversely exactly once .",
    "then given @xmath97 , let @xmath10 be a complete set of cutting disks of @xmath3 such that @xmath13 , and such that @xmath90 intersects @xmath4 minimally subject to @xmath98 . now the goal is to show that if @xmath12 , @xmath99 , or @xmath100 , then @xmath4 and @xmath15 have an r - r diagram with the form of figure [ dispcfig1a ] , [ dispcfig2a ] or [ dispcfig3a ] respectively .",
    "consider the first possibility @xmath12 . in this case , since @xmath4 is primitive in @xmath3 , we must have @xmath11 , and then the pair of disjoint primitives @xmath9 is also a pair of primitives in @xmath8 .",

    "this partition of @xmath5 into @xmath103 provides a natural framework of the sort described in subsection [ genus two r - r diagrams ] , which leads to an r - r diagram describing how @xmath4 , @xmath15 , @xmath88 , and @xmath90 , are configured in @xmath5 .    in this case",
    ", this is quite easy . since @xmath4 and @xmath15 are disjoint , while @xmath99 , @xmath104 must consist of a single connection",

    "can be used to obtain an r - r diagram of @xmath4 and @xmath15 on @xmath5 as was used in the previous case .",
    "the r - r diagram will differ of course , because now @xmath4 has more than one connection in each of @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "we can determine what these connections of @xmath4 can be by looking at the cyclic word which @xmath4 represents in @xmath8 .",
