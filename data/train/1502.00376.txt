    "astronomical masers such as h@xmath0o and sio are unique tools for studying mass - loss activities in high mass star formation .",
    "these maser species are basically excited in strong shocks on a working surface between a protostellar outflow and a dense envelope ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the masers allow us to directly observe an intrinsic outflow driven by individual high mass young stellar objects ( hmysos ) within 10@xmath6 au scale , minimizing any contamination from a mass entrainment and/or outflows driven by nearby cluster members .",
    "outflow properties such as size , velocity and morphology , predicted from interferometric maser studies vary source to source , e.g. , collimated jet ( @xcite ) , disk wind ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , wide angle outflow ( @xcite ) , expanding shell ( @xcite ; @xcite;@xcite ) , equatorial outflow ( @xcite ) or combination of jet and wide angle outflow ( @xcite ) .",
    "such divergences are possibly related to a number of factors such as stellar mass , evolutionary stage , geometry of surrounding envelope and driving mechanism of host outflows .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter paper i ) focused on a highly variable h@xmath0o maser source associated with a southern hmyso , g353.273 + 0.641 ( hereafter g353 ) .",
    "they have found two intermittent maser flares during two years , combining a frequent monitoring by very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) and single - dish observation . in paper",
    "i , they proposed that such a flare activity is recurrently excited by episodic shock propagations caused by a high - velocity protostellar jet .",
    "if this is the case , one can extract time - domain information of a jet - launching region from a maser variability , since bright maser emission allows us easy and frequent monitoring even with a small size radio telescope .",
    "such a region is expected to be so small ( @xmath1 a few au or less , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , compared to current observational resolutions .",
    "g353 is embedded in the high mass star - forming region ngc6357 .",
    "@xcite determined its photometric distance as 1.74 @xmath7 0.31 kpc from the sun .",
    "exact yso mass is still unclear , however , association of a class ii ch@xmath8oh maser emission suggests that the source is already a high mass object ( @xcite , hereafter cp08 ) .",
    "g353 is known as the dominant blue - shifted maser ( dbsm ) source that is a special class of a 22 ghz h@xmath0o maser sources ( cp08 ) .",
    "dbsms have a highly asymmetric spectrum , where almost all the flux is concentrated in highly blue - shifted components . the peak line - of - sight ( los ) velocities",
    "are ranged from -60 to -45 km@xmath9 against the systemic velocity ( @xmath10 ) of @xmath1 -5.0 km s@xmath9 in the case of g353 , adopted from the peak velocity of the class ii ch@xmath8oh maser emission ( cp08 ) .",
    "cp08 proposed that dbsms are excited by a well - collimated jet in a nearly face - on geometry .",
    "@xcite have actually detected both of a faint radio jet and an extremely high - velocity thermal sio jet , supporting cp08 .",
    "paper i also found a signature of maser acceleration along the los in two velocity components ( @xmath1 -53 km s@xmath9 and 73 km s@xmath9 ) accompanied by a significant flare - up .",
    "such an acceleration was observed in both of the single - dish and vlbi data , excluding instrumental errors . despite a similar acceleration rate ( @xmath1 -5 km s@xmath9 yr@xmath9 )",
    ", these two components were spatially independent .",
    "this fact confirmed that observed acceleration was not an apparent phenomenon caused by christmas - tree effect and/or any variation of internal structures of individual maser features , but a real one driven by global momentum supply related to shock propagations .    in this paper , we report on further monitoring observations of the h@xmath0o maser at 22.23508 ghz ( @xmath11 = @xmath12@xmath13 ) towards g353 .",
    "we have studied variability and recurrence in spatial distributions of maser features between each flare , employing denser vlbi monitoring intervals than our previous work .",
    "new single - dish data validated the systematic acceleration of the masers .",
    "the vlbi monitoring was performed by the vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) .",
    "typical observing interval was @xmath1 45 days that is roughly half of that in paper i. we had total 15 epochs between 2010 september to 2012 august .",
    "all observations were made in the dual beam mode , where target and phase calibrator were observed simultaneously ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "total on - source time was @xmath1 5 hours in each epoch .",
    "the phase tracking center for g353 was ( @xmath14,@xmath15)@xmath16 = ( , ) .",
    "we used a bright quasar , j1717 - 3342 ( @xmath1 700 mjy ) for the dual - beam phase referencing .",
    "the separation angle between g353 and j1717 - 3342 is with a position angle of - .",
    "nrao530 and/or pks1510 - 089 was observed once per hour for delay and bandpass calibration .",
    "antenna gains were corrected based on measured system noise temperatures ( @xmath17 ) of each stations .",
    "typical @xmath17 are ranged 200  400 k for mizusawa and iriki stations and 400  800 k for ogasawara and ishigaki stations .",
    "details of backends and correlation processes were already described in paper i. we observed single left - hand circular polarization with a data rate of 1024 mb s@xmath9 ( 2 bit , 512 mhz sampling ) .",
    "the total bandwidth was 240 mhz ( 16 mhz @xmath3 15 if ) for calibrators and 16 mhz ( 1 if ) for g353 .",
    "we cut out an 8-mhz sub - if from the maser if and divided it into 512 spectral channels in initial two epochs , as it was in paper i. the total velocity coverage is 108 km s@xmath9 with spectral resolution of 0.21 km s@xmath9 . on the other hand , we used two 8-mhz sub - ifs in latter 13 epochs , in order to cover a larger velocity range in g353 .",
    "central frequencies of these sub - ifs are separated 4 mhz , as both including maser emission peaks .",
    "this gives a velocity coverage of 162 km s@xmath9 with the same spectral resolution .",
    "data reduction was carried out in the standard reduction procedure for vera data ( see @xcite ) , using the astronomical imaging processing system ( aips ) package developed by national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) .",
    "we first determined an astrometric frame in each epoch from phase - referenced positions of bright maser spots with respect to j1717 - 3342 , and then , fringe - fitting and self - calibration were performed using the brightest maser channel in each epoch .",
    "we finally searched all maser spots from the self - calibrated data cube with a detection limit of 6 @xmath18 .",
    "searched area was @xmath3 from the phase tracking center .",
    "an interval of phase solution was @xmath12 min for a fringe - fitting using j1717 - 3342 , and down to 15 sec in final self - calibration .",
    "only a maser emission that appeared in successive three or more spectral channels in at least one observing epoch was treated as a real detection .",
    "each set of spatially successive maser spots was defined as a maser feature that means individual gas clump , showing a single - peaked velocity profile .",
    "velocities and positions of each feature were determined by the flux - weighted averaging .",
    "we included thermal image noises , baseline solution errors and tropospheric zenith delay residuals as astrometric error sources .",
    "the third term was estimated within a typical range of @xmath7 3 cm , by the image - optimization method @xcite .",
    "this estimation , however , seemed to be incomplete in some epochs , since image dynamic ranges were still limited even after the correction .",
    "we deduced overall errors of the image optimization , using two distinct sub - if data which were available in most epochs .",
    "we analyzed each dataset independently and compared astrometric positions of maser spots detected in both data .",
    "these positions were basically consistent within an error of thermal image noises , but some epochs show a significant positional offset up to 3 milli - arcsecond ( mas ) . to be conservative ,",
    "we included it in total astrometric errors as a systematic error of our analysis , since frequency difference of only 4 mhz is unlikely to cause such a large offset .",
    "the relative positional accuracies in the self - calibrated data , which were dominated by thermal image noises , are better than 0.03 and 0.1 mas for the right ascension and declination , respectively .",

    "the spectrum contains both of the single - dish and vlbi data .",
    "the velocity widths were sometimes narrower in the latter data , because of resolved - out flux ( e.g. , day @xmath1 840 ) .",
    "there is a clear signature of a systematic acceleration in several velocity components .",
    "as already mentioned , accelerations of two velocity components in the 1st flare - up ( @xmath1 -53 and -73 km s@xmath9 ) were already reported in paper i. these spatially independent components have shown a similar acceleration rate ( @xmath1 -5 km s@xmath9 yr@xmath9 ) .",
    "after the 2nd flare - up , the newly appeared component around -47 km s@xmath9 had been continuously accelerated up to -63 km s@xmath9 during 3 years .",
    "the linearly - fitted acceleration rate of this new component is -5.4 @xmath7 0.18 km s@xmath9 yr@xmath9 , where velocity dispersions were used as a fitting weight .",
    "this is consistent with that of the two components in the 1st flare - up .",
    "these accelerations along the los were also recognized in four individual maser features .",
    "we accepted only an acceleration that exceeds a velocity dispersion of each maser feature , in order to avoid apparent accelerations that can be caused by an internal structure of features .",

    "the averaged acceleration rate well agrees with that derived from the dynamic spectrum .",
    "it should be noted that no significant acceleration is found in proper motions .",
    "this is probably because the acceleration of -5 km s@xmath9 yr@xmath9 is relatively small , and also , an accelerating force is mainly along the los .",
    "we will discuss about proper motions and an inclination angle of the maser outflow in the following sections .",
    "these accelerations along the los probably contribute to the short maser lifetime in g353 , decreasing the coherent path for maser amplification .",

    "some features were also detected in epoch 17 , which was observed by only three stations because of the antenna trouble in mizusawa station .",
    "however , data in this epoch were not included for the astrometric analysis , because all features showed large and systematic jump ( @xmath1 3 mas ) of absolute positions .",
    "there were five maser features available in these criteria ( see table [ tab : feature ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that we only used @xmath24 data for a parallax fitting , since @xmath25 data contributed not at all .",
    "this is because the synthesized beams were significantly elongated along the n - s direction , causing large errors in @xmath25 direction ( see table [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "in addition , expected amplitude of a sinusoidal motion in @xmath25 direction was five times smaller than that in @xmath24 , because of a small ecliptic latitude ( @xmath1 -11@xmath29 ) .",

    "the formal error was estimated as the reduced @xmath33 square to be unity .",
    "unfortunately , a short lifetime of the maser features prevented us to trace a full parallactic cycle .",
    "our parallax fitting can contains a systematic error that can not be evaluated directly .",
    "we deduced such a systematic error via the montecarlo analysis , where 10@xmath34-times simulated fittings were performed , using the same observing epochs and the parallax of 0.59 mas .",

    "the newly derived distance is 1.70 @xmath5 kpc .",
    "this is consistent with the commonly used photometric distance @xcite .",
    "we , thus , conclude that our parallax measurement is well reliable and new distance of 1.7 kpc were employed in this paper .",

    "therefore , we also estimated relative proper motions with respect to the reference maser features , in order to discuss intrinsic 3d kinematics of the masers .",
    "we employed four distinct reference features , since no identical feature survived throughout all the observing epochs .",
    "data were , hence , divided into four durations ( epoch 2  7 , 8  11 , 12  15 and 16  23 ) , depending on a reference feature .",
    "we estimated relative proper motions for each duration , using only a feature that detected in three or more epoch .",
    "all the features used for relative motion measurements are also listed in table [ tab : feature ] .",
    "internal proper motions without any systemic motion were derived using these relative motions , as follows .",
    "an relative proper motion vector of i - th feature ( @xmath35 ) can be expressed as , @xmath36 here @xmath37 and @xmath38 indicates an internal proper motion vector of i - th and reference maser feature , respectively .",
    "one can reconstruct @xmath37 , if both of @xmath39 and @xmath38 are avilable .",

    "it should be noted that the assumption of the equation ( 2 ) is adequate in our case .",
    "this was examined by following procedures , comparing @xmath37 with that independently deduced from the absolute proper motions ( @xmath44 ) in table [ tab : absolute ] .",

    "table [ tab : inclination ] contains 3d velocities and inclination angles , which were calculated from the internal proper motions and los velocities assuming the distance of 1.7 kpc .",
    "almost all the blue - shifted features have 3d motions nearly along the los .",
    "this fact confirmed that the h@xmath0o masers in g353 were associated with a face - on protostellar jet , as proposed by cp08 .",

    "the averaged inclination angles are 17@xmath29 and 34@xmath29 from the los for the eastward and westward features , respectively .",
    "if the masers are excited on the working surface between the jet and cavity wall having a constant opening angle , the jet axis is rather inclined ( @xmath1 8@xmath29 ) to the west from the los .",
    "another possible explanation is that the masers are associated with two distinct outflows having a different collimation as in the case of cepa hw2 @xcite , i.e. , collimated jet and wide angle ( or equatorial ) outflow .",
    "if this is the case , the eastward features , which have rather higher 3d velocities , may trace the collimated jet .",
    "a jet inclination of @xmath1 17@xmath29 is simply expected from the averaged inclination of the eastward masers . on the other hand ,",
    "a wide angle outflow traced by the westward features would have a large opening angle up to @xmath1 80@xmath29 from the jet axis .",
    "schematic views of these two cases are showed in figure [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "although the red - shifted features at the west end strongly suggest a bipolar morphology along the e - w direction , this position angle seems to be perpendicular to that of the radio jet in the arcsecond scale @xcite .",
    "this can be explained by the projection effect , or the radio jet may trace an ionized equatorial wind reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these red - shifted features are moving almost along the celestial plane , contrary to the blue - shifted features .",
    "we suggest that the blue - shifted masers trace more intrinsic outflow kinematics at the root region , since the peak position of the radio jet indicates that the host object is located at the almost same position as the central blue - shifted cluster ( see figure [ fig : flare ] ) .",
    "if the red - shifted features are excited by the same driving source , the jet may be strongly bending within 500 au from the source , otherwise , these features can be associated with a wide - angle outflow , discussed above . a vlbi position and proper motion of",
    "the extremely red - shifted component will allow us to solve these questions , because such high - velocity component probably reflects an intrinsic motion of the westward jet .",
    "an interferometric imaging of the thermal molecular jet found in @xcite will be also helpful to understand the overall extent and trajectory of the jet .",

    "paper i discussed that such a recurrent shock is possibly caused by an episodic jet - launching or precession .",
    "although our new data do not exclude both cases , no precession signature in the radio jet may support the episodic jet - launching .",
    "the spatial scale in which the maser filament recurrently appeared is @xmath1 100 @xmath3 100 au@xmath4 .",
    "this scale can be resolved by the maximum resolution of atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) in near future .",
    "therefore , there will be a chance to directly determine which case is correct , by monitoring of how shocked gas varies using a thermal tracer .",
    "such a monitoring was already succeeded in the case of the molecular jet associated with a nearby low mass protostar @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : dynamic ] indicates that the acceleration of the main velocity component also occurs recurrently .",
    "in addition , the acceleration had clearly continued beyond a lifetime of individual maser feature .",
    "these facts suggest that the h@xmath0o maser in g353 traces a region where molecular gas is steadily accelerated .",
    "the spatial distribution of accelerating velocity components is almost consistent with the region where maser features are recurrently formed , i.e. , @xmath1 100 @xmath3 100 au@xmath4 wide around the root of the bipolar jet .",
    "if we adopt the expected inclinations and opening angles , the los extent of such an accelerating region is 180  300 au .",
    "the thermal sio spectrum reported in @xcite has indicated that the maximum los velocity of shocked molecular gas is @xmath1 -120 km s@xmath9 , similar to that of the maser emission .",
    "an important fact is that such highest - velocity maser components have shown no significant acceleration in our monitoring .",
    "it can be interpreted as that the molecular jet is accelerated up to this velocity , and then , turns into free expansion . in order to examine this possibility ,",
    "we must study velocity structures of both pre - shock and post - shock gas along the jet axis in multi - scale .",
    "the most plausible origin of such an acceleration is momentum supply from an optical jet .",
    "a momentum rate of the maser flow in g353 was estimated as @xmath1 10@xmath47 @xmath48 km",
    "s@xmath9 yr@xmath9 in paper i. this order of momentum rate is often found in high mass star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if we consider a radiation pressure , a bolometric luminosity higher than 10@xmath49 @xmath50 is required to achieve the momentum rate at the radius of 150 au , although such a high luminosity is quite rare and may be unlikely case in g353 .",
    "another possible origin is a magnetic pressure gradient along the jet axis ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this can be examined by a first - principle mhd simulation , tracing rather longer - term outflow evolution than that commonly reported at present .",
    "@xcite have shown that the number of dbsms without any oh maser ( i.e. , youngest evolutionary stage ) is statistically superior to red - shifted counterparts where maser fluxes dominated by highly red - shifted emissions .",
    "therefore , there must be some intrinsic origin of the blue - shift dominance . @xcite",
    "have proposed that an optically thick disk in a nearly face - on geometry can selectively cause a blue - shift dominance , masking any red - shifted emission .",
    "this scenario is still plausible , because there is no red - shifted component around the center of the bipolar distribution , where the host hmyso is thought to be embedded with a disk .",
    "further test will be given by an exact position of the extremely red - shifted component at + 87 km s@xmath9 .",
    "alternatively , if a circumstellar radiation field is completely dominated by spherically - symmetric fluxes from a central object , only blue - shifted components can receive seed photons for maser amplifications towards the observer .",
    "the two - outflow model may prefer this explanation , allowing a lack of eastward red - shifted masers associated with the wide angle outflow .",
    "this can be applicable in the case of g353 that has no background hii region . in either case",

    "one must compare the geometry of a disk / jet system , optical depth of a disk and circumstellar environment in several dbsms , combining a vlbi array and the highest - resolution connected array such as alma .",
    "we have conducted a follow - up vlbi and single - dish monitoring for the highly variable h@xmath0o masers in g353 .",
    "thanks to the denser monitoring interval than that in paper i , several properties of g353 have been revealed as follows .",

    "<S> we report on a long - term single - dish and vlbi monitoring for intermittent flare activities of a dominant blue - shifted h@xmath0o maser ( dbsm ) associated with a southern high mass young stellar object , g353.273 + 0.641 . </S>",
    "<S> bi - weekly single - dish monitoring using hokkaido university tomakomai 11-m radio telescope has shown that a systematic acceleration continues over four years beyond a lifetime of individual maser features . </S>",
    "<S> this fact suggests that the h@xmath0o maser traces a region where molecular gas is steadily accelerated . </S>",
    "<S> there were five maser flares during five - years monitoring , and maser distributions in four of them were densely monitored by the vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) . </S>",
    "<S> the overall distribution of the maser features suggests the presence of a bipolar jet , with the 3d kinematics indicating that it is almost face - on ( inclination angle of @xmath1 8@xmath217@xmath2 from the line - of - sight ) . </S>",
    "<S> most of maser features were recurrently excited within a region of 100@xmath3100 au@xmath4 around the radio continuum peak , while their spatial distributions significantly varied between each flare . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms that episodic propagations of outflow shocks recurrently invoke intermittent flare activities . </S>",
    "<S> we also measured annual parallax , deriving the source distance of 1.70 @xmath5 kpc that is consistent with the commonly - used photometric distance . </S>"
