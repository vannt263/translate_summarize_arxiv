    "the effective field theory method isolates properly those degrees of freedom in a dynamical system which are driving the dynamics in a certain range of energy  momentum .",
    "formally , an effective field theory is represented by a functional integral in which we perform an appropriate splitting of the field  theoretic degrees of freedom @xmath5 : @xmath6 the fields @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) have fourier components corresponding to momenta @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) where @xmath11 is a characteristic energy scale in the problem which _ defines _ the low energy effective dynamics . now the effective field theory below the scale @xmath11 is obtained formally by integrating out the high  frequency modes @xmath7 in the functional integral .",
    "what remains after the integrations defines the _ effective lagrangian density _",
    "@xmath12 which is an infinite series in a derivative expansion and describes the low energy dynamics . the issue of whether the splitting ( [ split ] ) can always lead to a meaningful effective theory is a very complicated one , and in general depends on the details of the dynamics and the cut  off scale @xmath11 . in most cases of interest , however , the concept of an effective theory is useful in describing the basic features of the underlying dynamics ( below the scale @xmath11 ) in a simple way .",
    "one of the most important tools in the study of effective field theories is the renormalization group @xcite .",
    "this technique allows one to group effective field theories with apparently very different interactions into categories which emphasise their common features , e.g.  similar scaling exponents of certain correlation functions ( which can be measured experimentally ) .",
    "such groups of effective theories are termed `` universality classes '' and prove essential in understanding the similar properties of ostensibly different physical systems : all systems in the same universality class flow to the same renormalization group fixed point @xcite .",
    "the aim of this set of lectures is to introduce the concept of an effective field theory and the associated renormalization group techniques , first in a generic way , and later on through some specific and physically interesting examples ; these will include the bcs superconductivity phenomenon ( as a guided exercise for the reader ) and a possible explanation of the abnormal properties of high  temperature superconductors in their normal phase .",
    "the structure of the lectures is as follows : in the first half of the lectures ( sections [ rgsec][rg+sf ] ) the basic features of the renormalization group approach to effective field theories is discussed briefly .",
    "particular attention is paid to discussing scaling properties of systems with a fermi surface , relevant for condensed matter applications .",
    "the important concept of quasiparticles is introduced in section [ rg+sf ] .",
    "there are excitations of the fermi surface which are appropriately dressed so as to have the correct scaling under the renormalization group .",

    "gauge field interaction vertex becomes marginally relevant and drives the theory to non  fermi liquid behaviour in the infra red .",
    "the fixed point structure is non  perturbative and is discovered using a renormalization group improved dyson  schwinger analysis @xcite",
    ".    the interesting feature of the qed@xmath16 dyson  schwinger resummed problem is that the `` running '' coupling coincides with the inverse of a fermion flavour number , thereby providing an interesting application of the above  mentioned effective running of flavour number in the context of condensed matter physics .",
    "some physical consequences of this phenomenon , concerning the scaling of the electrical resistivity in qed@xmath16 at finite temperature are discussed with the aim of comparing the results with the phenomenology of the normal phase of high temperature superconductors ( section [ last ] ) .",

    "consider a field theory in which an energy scale @xmath17 is introduced .",
    "this energy scale need not be associated with the normal divergence  cancelling cut  offs in field theory .",
    "effective field theory is a method for analysing the physics at lower energy scales @xmath18 . to construct the effective field theory ,",
    "split the fields into high and low frequency components @xmath7 and @xmath19 with frequencies above and below the scale @xmath20 respectively ( from here on @xmath21 ) : @xmath22 where @xmath23 in general the split can be performed smoothly or sharply : the specifics of the split will not matter here .",
    "now the high - frequency components @xmath7 are integrated out in the functional integral @xmath24 and the _ wilsonian effective action _",
    "@xmath25 is given by @xmath26    the effective action @xmath27 can be expanded in a complete set of local operators : @xmath28 where the sum runs over all local operators @xmath29 allowed by the symmetries of the model and the @xmath30 are the associated couplings , which may be thought of as coordinates in coupling space .",

    "[ operators ]    .classification of operators in an effective field theory . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the lesson to be learned from the power counting above is that the low energy physics is only sensitive to the high energy theory through the marginal and relevant couplings . in most cases",
    "there is a finite number of relevant and marginal couplings , so in principle the low energy physics depends on only a finite number of parameters .",
    "there are subtleties , however , due to possible infra red structure , i.e.  divergences in the low energy theory .",
    "the simple power counting above is done from the free action , and so the interactions present in the full effective action ( [ effac ] ) can affect the behaviour : operators can change between being marginal , relevant and irrelevant as a result of the interactions .      the scaling derived from simple power counting is modified by interactions in the effective theory ; these effects are encoded in the @xmath43function .",
    "the @xmath43functions for the renormalized couplings @xmath44 are defined as follows : @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the anomalous dimensions ( due to quantum corrections ) and the @xmath47 are the coefficients of the operator product expansion pertaining to the three  point functions of the theory : @xmath48 , etc . , @xmath49 and where @xmath50 indicates correlators taken with respect to @xmath51 ( see equation ( [ opexpansion ] ) ) .    in coupling space indices are raised and lowered by the so  called zamolodchikov @xcite metric : @xmath52 where now the symbol @xmath53 indicates correlators taken with respect to the full ( interacting ) action , equation ( [ effac ] ) .",
    "the covariant coefficients @xmath54 appearing in the three  point functions are totally symmetric in their indices .",
    "close to the fixed point ( at least to order @xmath55 ) , the @xmath43functions defined above are related @xcite to a gradient flow in coupling space @xmath56 the renormalization group invariant flow function @xmath57 in two dimensional systems has been related to the components of the stress tensor of the theory @xcite . in higher dimensions",
    "@xmath57 is still not known in closed form , although attempts have been made to relate it to stress tensor components by appropriate extension of the two dimensional case @xcite .",
    "notice that the total symmetry of @xmath54 is crucial @xcite for the gradient flow ( [ phiflow ] ) .    in the case of two dimensional unitary theories",
    "the metric @xmath58 is manifestly positive definite @xcite and hence relations like equation ( [ phiflow ] ) imply , in view of the renormalization group invariance of @xmath57 , that the flow function decreases along the renormalization group trajectories in coupling space : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a renormalization group scale . according to reference @xcite the value of the flow function at a fixed point coincides with the central charge of the corresponding two dimensional conformal field theory .",
    "hence the relation ( [ flowlesszero ] ) implies that under relevant perturbations a unitary theory flows along a direction of decreasing central charge .",
    "this poses interesting restrictions on the flow of two dimensional theories which might have interesting physical applications @xcite . in higher dimensions",
    "the proof of such an irreversibility is not yet complete but recently there have been interesting attempts @xcite .",
    "such a theorem on the irreversibility of the renormalization group flow in @xmath61 dimensions is expected to hold on general grounds for effective field theories are plagued by loss of information from the modes above the scale @xmath11 which are integrated out .",
    "such modes contribute a non ",
    "zero entropy change which in the case of two dimensional physics has been shown to correspond to the flow function @xmath57 .",
    "a single marginal coupling will typically have a @xmath43function as follows : @xmath62 which can readily be integrated to give the solution @xmath63 for @xmath64 the coupling decreases at low energies and is marginally irrelevant . if @xmath65 the coupling grows and is marginally relevant .",
    "a strictly marginal coupling is only obtained if the @xmath43function vanishes to all orders in @xmath66 .",
    "so it is seen that the physics of a system with a marginal coupling depends on the details of the problem , here encoded in @xmath67 .",
    "a marginally relevant coupling can lead to interesting effects ; for example , in qcd a marginally relevant coupling leads to confinement and chiral symmetry breaking ; similarly in condensed matter models of the resistivity in the presence of magnetic impurities , the kondo effect @xcite leads to an increase in the resistivity in the deep infra red ( the very low temperature region ) .    for a single coupling the gradient flow relation ( [ phiflow ] )",
    "is trivial to prove .",
    "it is not at all trivial to prove the relation for models with more than one coupling , for the existence of a gradient flow requires the curl  free condition on the quantity @xmath68 .",
    "this has been shown in @xmath61 dimensions at least in the neighbourhood of a fixed point ( to order @xmath55 ) in reference @xcite .      in effective field theories ,",
    "non  renormalizable terms do not cause problems , for there is an ultra violet cut  off which automatically acts as a regulator for the associated divergences .",
    "indeed , non  renormalizable terms _ have _ to appear at some scale in the effective theory : in fact the information about where the cut  off must lie is encoded in these terms . for effective field theories there is a new problem , not found in conventional field theories : super  renormalizable terms , which grow below the cut  off .",
    "this means that , without unnatural fine  tuning of the original parameters , all masses in the effective field theory must be of order of the cut  off ; this is a contradiction , however , for such fields can not appear in the effective theory at all .",
    "so effective theories must be _ natural _ , meaning that there must exist symmetries which force the masses to vanish .",
    "a pertinent example of this is the u@xmath69(1 ) effective gauge field theory of doped antiferromagnets at the @xmath70-wave gap ( see section [ su2crossu1 ] ) : the charged excitations are described by dirac fermions whose masses are forced to vanish by chiral symmetry ; there are also gauge fields forced massless by gauge invariance .",
    "to include scalars in a model their masses must be forbidden by goldstone s theorem or supersymmetry .",
    "there is also a problem with super ",
    "renormalizable interactions : at scales below the cut  off , the ( dimensionless ) coupling will grow to larger than unity , and hence the low energy theory may be described by new degrees of freedom : bound states , condensates , etc .",
    "an exception to this is when the infra red behaviour is governed by a ( non  trivial ) fixed point , in which case the theory may still be described by the original degrees of freedom .",
    "an example is qed@xmath16 ( see section [ qed3 ] ) , which is super ",
    "renormalizable , but renormalization group improved dyson ",
    "schwinger analysis reveals a non  trivial infra red fixed point @xcite . as will be discussed later in lecture ii ( section [ qed3 ] ff . )",

    "effective field theory is a tool for understanding the physics of renormalization .",
    "* interactions in an effective field theory can be classified as _ relevant , marginal , or irrelevant _ according to their scaling properties .",
    "* the infra red physics is only sensitive to the high energy theory through the marginal and relevant couplings . *",
    "when a marginal coupling grows large , interesting physics can result .",

    "however , from the connexion between qed@xmath16 and underlying statistical models @xcite , a dependence on @xmath268 in the exponent in equation ( [ scalingexpt ] ) is to be expected from the following general argument : in qed@xmath16 , @xmath446 , and from the analysis in reference @xcite the coupling @xmath447 depends on the doping concentration .",
    "since a detailed microscopic model is lacking at present , a phenomenological approach may be adopted to try to infer the doping dependence of the gauge coupling by comparing the resistivity curves fitted from equation ( [ scalingexpt ] ) with the experimental ones @xcite .",
    "the scaling law ( [ scalingexpt ] ) is an interesting prediction of the gauge spin ",
    "charge separation approach to high temperature superconductivity , however it may not be unique to this model . indeed , such scaling can also be obtained in different approaches @xcite .",
    "in some of them @xcite the non  trivial infra red fixed point structure plays a rle in inducing the deviations from the linear resistivity in analogy with equation ( [ scalingexpt ] ) .",
    "in other treatments @xcite , a phenomenological approach to luttinger and fermi liquids has been adopted by combining spin ",
    "charge separation with the anomalous scaling of a luttinger liquid in postulating the following unconventional form for the one electron retarded green s function @xcite : @xmath448 where appropriate phase factors have been left out for simplicity . for low energy excitations near the fermi surface @xmath449 the indices",
    "@xmath450 respectively denoting charge and spin degrees of freedom . in this",
    "approach spin ",
    "charge separation arises because of the different propagation velocities @xmath451 in a direct generalization of the one dimensional case .",
    "what the authors of @xcite argue is that upon requiring time ",
    "reversal invariance ( in the absence of external fields ) the exponents in the green s function ( [ branchcuts ] ) are given by @xmath452 the fermi liquid theory corresponds to @xmath453 and @xmath454 , in which case the green s functions ( [ branchcuts ] ) have only single pole excitations corresponding to the electronic degrees of freedom . in the @xmath455 and @xmath456 case there are branch cuts corresponding to spinon and holon quasiparticle excitations .",
    "the presence of the @xmath455 exponent leads to a scaling of the direct current resistivity @xmath382 in the normal phase of the high  t@xmath4 systems of the form @xmath457 the authors of @xcite fit this scaling with the experimental data @xcite by postulating @xmath458 and assuming a doping dependence .",
    "although the method above made use of a different microscopic treatment of spin  charge separation ( equation ( [ spinchargeeq ] ) ) the similarity of the scaling laws ( [ scalingexpt ] ) and ( [ by ] ) encourages further studies in order to try to establish a connexion between the two approaches .",
    "in these lectures a renormalization group approach to the effective field theory of condensed matter systems has been discussed .",
    "the approach proves to be extremely powerful insofar as it yields useful information on the universal behaviour of apparently different physical systems .",
    "the basic properties of the renormalization group have been described briefly , and the various effective field theory interactions have been classified according to their renormalization group scaling properties .",
    "bcs superconducting instabilities were studied by means of an exercise for the reader : they were described in terms of relevant renormalization group operators driving the theory away from the trivial infra red fixed point ( landau s fermi liquid ) .",
    "particular attention was paid to discussing quasiparticles , which are linearized excitations about the fermi surface which exhibit appropriate scaling under the renormalization group .",
    "such linearizations led naturally to the concept of an effective fermion `` flavour number , '' which is the ( large ) number of excitations near the landau fixed point in condensed matter systems with large fermi surfaces .",
    "in such cases , the area of the fermi surface may be identified ( roughly ) with the flavour number .",
    "such large@xmath0 effective theories have a running flavour number due to the dependence in @xmath0 on the cut  off scale in the theory .    in the second part of the lectures an interesting application of the above ideas , in particular the running flavour number ,",
    "was discussed via the study of infra red structure in strongly coupled u(1 ) gauge theory with relativistic massless fermions .",
    "physical arguments were given as to why such models may be relevant for the physics of high temperature superconducting cuprates .",
    "the ( non  perturbative ) infra red structure of qed@xmath16 has been studied extensively using a renormalization group improved dyson ",
    "schwinger approach , resummed to leading order in @xmath168 .",
    "self consistent solutions have been found in landau and non  local gauges , and the importance of the infra red cut  off has been discussed .",
    "the non  trivial infra red fixed point leads to very slow running of the coupling , which may have important consequences for the physics of systems described by these models ( e.g.  the size of the gap and the associated coherence length in superconductors ) .",
    "the computation of some critical exponents using the non  local gauge and landau  khalatnikov transformation was also discussed .",
    "discontinuities arising from the removal of covariant infra red cut  offs and related landau damping type effects in finite temperature theories have also been discussed .",
    "the connexion leads to natural predictions for the resistivity in gauge field mediated models .",
    "gauge interactions lead to a resistivity linear in the temperature , and the slow running coupling ( affecting the system through the wavefunction renormalization ) alters this behaviour with @xmath459 corrections in the exponent .",
    "it is possible that these corrections are experimentally testable .",
    "in fact , recent experimental data seem consistent with slight deviations from linear @xmath2 behaviour in the direct current resistivity @xcite .",
    "the fundamental ideas which have been covered are as follows :    * renormalization group analysis for u(1 ) gauge theories in a large@xmath0 framework @xmath460 dyson  schwinger analysis improved by the renormalization group .",
    "* connexion with landau ",
    "fermi theory : an increase in the area of the fermi surface corresponds to an increase in the number of flavours , and hence eventually the large@xmath0 limit .",
    "* approach the superconducting ( chiral symmetry broken ) phase from the normal phase . * use the renormalization group to investigate the evolution of fermi surfaces in planar systems : reduction to a small momentum range in the deep infra red ( in an appropriate doping regime ) , which admits a _ relativistic _ effective field theory description . *",
    "it is found that the effective @xmath0 ( in the large@xmath461 regime ) is renormalized , and runs with the scale : this generates a running in theory space . *",
    "this slow running of @xmath0 is an exclusive feature of u(1 ) gauge theories .",
    "the gauge interactions have a tendency to reduce the size of the fermi surface , and hence lead to non  fermi liquid behaviour .",
