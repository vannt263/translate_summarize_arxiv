    "the origin of the so called dark energy responsible for the present cosmic acceleration remains a great mystery .",
    "since the cosmological constant ( originating from the vacuum energy ) is plagued by a severe fine - tuning problem , many alternative models have been proposed to account for the origin of dark energy ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) . a number of these models , including the quintessence @xcite , k - essence @xcite and tachyon @xcite models , make use of a scalar field with a very light mass ( @xmath4  ev ) in order to account for the present cosmic acceleration .",
    "if the scalar field originates from candidate theories for fundamental interactions such as string theory or supergravity , it should interact with the standard model particles with a long ranged force ( the so called `` fifth force '' ) . in string theory , for example , a dilaton field universally couples to matter as well as gravity @xcite .",
    "similarly , in modified gravity theories such as @xmath5 gravity @xcite and scalar - tensor theories @xcite , the scalar degree of freedom interacts with the matter fluid ( except for radiation ) .",
    "this is clearly seen if one transforms the action to the einstein frame via a conformal transformation @xcite .",
    "for example , it is known that brans - dicke theory @xcite ( a historically important class of scalar - tensor theories ) gives rise to a constant coupling @xmath6 between the scalar field and the matter @xcite . in this sense",
    "such modified gravity theories can be regarded as a coupled quintessence scenario @xcite in the einstein frame .    in the absence of a scalar - field potential ,",
    "the present solar - system tests constrain the strength of the coupling @xmath6 to be smaller than the order of @xmath7 @xcite . however , the couplings that appear in string theory @xcite and @xmath5 gravity @xcite are typically of the order of unity . in such cases",
    "it is not possible to satisfy the local gravity constraints , unless a scalar - field potential with a large mass exists to suppress the coupling in the regions of high density .",
    "moreover , if the same field is responsible for the cosmic acceleration today , the potential needs to be sufficiently flat in the regions of low density ( i.e. , on cosmological scales ) .    in spite of the above requirements it is possible for the large coupling models to satisfy the local gravity constraints through the chameleon mechanism @xcite , while at the same time for the field to have sufficiently small mass to lead to the present cosmic acceleration .",
    "the existence of a matter coupling gives rise to an extremum of the scalar - field potential around which the field can be stabilized .",
    "in high density regions , such as the interiors of the astrophysical objects , the field mass about the extremum would be sufficiently large to avoid the propagation of the fifth force . meanwhile",
    ", the field would have a much lighter mass in the low - density environments , far away from compact objects , so that it could be responsible for the present cosmic acceleration . in the case of inverse power - law potentials",
    "@xmath8 @xcite with @xmath9 , local gravity constraints can be satisfied for @xmath10  ev @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this roughly corresponds to the energy scale required for the cosmic acceleration today .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for works concerning a number of interesting aspects of the chameleon mechanism .",
    "so far the analyses of the chameleon mechanism have typically concentrated on the weak gravity backgrounds where the spherically symmetric metric is described by a minkowski spacetime .",
    "this amounts to neglecting the backreaction of gravitational potential on the scalar - field equation . in ref .",
    "@xcite the field profile in the minkowski background was analytically derived both inside and outside the object by taking into account the mass of the chameleon field inside the body . in this settings",
    "it has been shown that the field would need to be extremely close to the maximum of the effective potential around the centre of the spherically symmetric body in order to allow thin - shell solutions required for consistency with the local gravity constraints .",
    "if we take into account the backreaction of gravitational potential to the field equation , the relativistic pressure is present even in weak gravity backgrounds such as the sun or the earth .",
    "it is expected that this effect changes the field profile inside the body in order to allow the existence of thin - shell solutions .",
    "we shall analytically derive the thin - shell field profile using a linear expansion in terms of the gravitational potential @xmath11 at the surface of compact objects .",
    "in fact we show that there exists a region around the centre of the massive objects in which the field evolves toward the maximum of the effective potential because of the presence of the relativistic pressure . in order to realize thin - shell solutions , the driving force along the potential needs to dominate over the pressure for distances larger than a critical value @xmath12 .",
    "this distance ( @xmath13 ) is required to be smaller than the distance @xmath14 at which the field enters a thin - shell regime . in spite of such different properties of the field profile inside the body relative to the case of the minkowski background",
    ", the effective coupling @xmath15 outside the body can be reduced by the presence of thin - shell solutions .",
    "we confirm this by using numerical simulations for a class of potentials of the form @xmath16 .",
    "to study the viability of theories with large couplings , it is important to determine whether thin - shell solutions can also exist in strong gravitational backgrounds with @xmath17 .",
    "we shall derive analytic solutions using linear expansions in terms of @xmath1 and then carry out numerical simulations to confirm the validity of solutions in the regimes with @xmath3 .",
    "our analytic solutions are useful as a way of finding the boundary conditions around the centre of the object in order to obtain thin - shell solutions . by choosing boundary conditions with field values larger than those estimated by the analytic solutions",
    ", we shall demonstrate numerically that the thin - shell solutions are present for backgrounds with gravitational potentials satisfying @xmath18 , in the case of the field potentials of the type @xmath16 .",
    "this marginally covers the case of neutron stars . in backgrounds with still larger gravitational potentials",
    "the relativistic pressure around the centre of the object is so strong that the field typically overshoots the maximum of the effective potential to reach the singularity at @xmath19 , unless the boundary conditions of the field around the centre of the body are chosen to be far from the maximum of the effective potential .",
    "this overshoot behaviour is similar to the one recently found by kobayashi and maeda @xcite in the context of @xmath5 dark energy models ( see also ref .",
    "we note , however , that our analytic solutions based on the linear expansion of @xmath1 do not cover the field profiles for the really strong gravitational backgrounds with @xmath20 . in such cases we need a separate analysis which incorporates the formation of black holes .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ setup ]",
    "we discuss our theoretical set up as well as giving the relevant equations for the case of a spherically symmetric central body . in section [ chame ]",
    "we give the analytical thin - shell solutions to the scalar field equations , both inside and outside of the body , and consider in turn the matching of thin - shell solutions . in section [ profile ]",
    "we study the analytical field profile in more details and discuss how the field evolves as a function of @xmath21 in the presence of the relativistic pressure . in section [ numerics ]",
    "we integrate the field equation numerically and show the existence of thin - shell solutions for @xmath18",

    "moreover , since the pressure is underestimated in our linear expansion of @xmath1 , we need to choose values of @xmath0 larger than the corresponding analytic values in order to prevent the field from entering the region @xmath337 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we plot an example of the numerical solution for @xmath338 , @xmath143 , @xmath274 , @xmath325 and @xmath326 , together with the corresponding analytic field profile . we have used the boundary condition @xmath339 , which is larger than the analytic value @xmath340 estimated by eq .",
    "( [ phiini ] ) .",
    "we note again that the resulting field profile is sensitive to the change of boundary conditions . as can be seen from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the derivative @xmath192 is negative in the region @xmath341 .",
    "the field grows for increasing @xmath21 in the region @xmath342 so that it enters the thin - shell regime for @xmath343 .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows that the numerical solution outside the body agrees well with the corresponding analytical solution .",
    "the solution asymptotically approaches the field value @xmath344 .",
    "we have also carried out numerical simulations for other model parameters in the strong gravitational backgrounds .",
    "we find that thin - shell solutions are present for @xmath18 , which marginally includes the case of neutron stars .",
    "when @xmath345 , however , the field continues to evolve toward smaller @xmath0 and overshoots the effective potential maximum at @xmath108 ( i.e. , @xmath346 ) unless the boundary condition around the centre of the body is chosen to be @xmath347 .",
    "the evolution of the field is typically followed by the rapid roll - down along the potential toward the singularity at @xmath19 ( as in the numerical simulations of kobayashi and maeda @xcite for the @xmath5 dark energy model of starobinsky @xcite ) .",
    "since the ratio @xmath348 is of the order of @xmath1 around the centre of the body , the pressure force is so strong that the field typically overshoots the effective potential maximum in such cases .",
    "we stress here that in strong gravitational backgrounds with @xmath349 a separate analysis is required without recourse to the analytic solutions derived here which are valid only in the regimes with @xmath17 .",
    "finally we note that the distance @xmath13 at which @xmath209 gets smaller for decreasing @xmath144 ( see table i ) .",
    "this may suggest that it is possible to avoid the overshooting of the field by choosing smaller values of @xmath144 .",
    "however , the parameter @xmath154 needs to satisfy the conditions @xmath137 and @xmath350 .",
    "this implies that we can not choose the values of @xmath145 that are smaller than the order of 10 .",
    "thus when @xmath351 and @xmath352 , it is typically difficult to obtain thin - shell solutions for @xmath345 , whereas thin - shell solutions are present for @xmath18 .",
    "in this paper we have studied the behaviour of the chameleon scalar field @xmath0 in the relativistic gravitational background of the spherically symmetric space time . the gravitational potentials @xmath353 and @xmath354 are found analytically under the conditions that the density of the central compact object is constant and that the energy density of the chameleon field is much smaller than that of the matter . using the gravitational potential @xmath1 at the surface of the body as a linear expansion parameter we have derived the scalar - field equation ( [ fieldeq ] )",
    ".    the solutions to the field equations can be obtained by considering the perturbation @xmath116 about the corresponding solution @xmath115 in the minkowski background . in the region",
    "@xmath110 the field exists around the minimum of the effective potential @xmath355 inside the body .",
    "the thin - shell case corresponds to settings in which @xmath14 is close to the radius @xmath70 of the body . in the region @xmath122 the coupling term @xmath356 dominates over the effective potential , which leads to rapid changes in the field . using linear expansions in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath116",
    "we have derived the solutions of the field equation in the regions @xmath110 and @xmath122 , see eqs .",
    "( [ phiso1 ] ) and ( [ phiso2 ] ) . outside the body",
    ", the kinetic energy of the field dominates over its potential energy , so that the approximate solution in this region is given by eq .",
    "( [ phiso3 ] ) .",
    "we have matched the three solutions at the distances @xmath14 and @xmath70 subject to boundary conditions ( [ boundary ] ) and have derived the analytical thin - shell field profile given by eqs .",
    "( [ phithin1])-([phithin3 ] ) . in discussing the analytical field profile ,",
    "we have considered the case @xmath93 for simplicity . compared to the result of the minkowski spacetime , the field @xmath0 around the centre of the body",
    "is shifted due to the presence of a relativistic pressure . for larger values of @xmath1 and @xmath256 ,",
    "the field derivative @xmath192 becomes negative in the region @xmath357 .",
    "for values of @xmath322 , @xmath192 becomes positive and the field @xmath158 begins to grow with increasing @xmath21 .",
    "as long as the condition @xmath257 is satisfied , the field acquires sufficient kinetic energy in the thin - shell regime in order to climb up the potential hill outside the body .    for the class of potentials @xmath16 we have carried out numerical simulations by using the information provided by the analytic field profile in order to set the boundary conditions around the centre of the body . in the minkowski background ( @xmath182 )",
    "the thin - shell field profile outside the body can be recovered numerically by choosing the boundary condition of the field to be larger than the corresponding analytic value .",
    "the reason for this comes from the fact that the analytic solution overestimates the field value in the region @xmath122 by neglecting the term @xmath295 relative to @xmath233 .    in the relativistic gravitational backgrounds with @xmath18",
    "we have also confirmed the presence of thin - shell solutions numerically .",
    "while there exists a region in which @xmath192 is negative inside the body , it is possible to realize thin - shell solutions if the derivative @xmath192 changes sign at a distance @xmath303 smaller than @xmath14 . for larger @xmath1",
    "the distance @xmath13 tends to increase so that the effect of the relativistic pressure is stronger inside the body .",
    "we note that our analysis does not cover the case of extremely stong gravitational backgrounds with @xmath1 of the order of unity .",
    "this requires a separate detailed analysis which incorporates the formation of black holes .",
    "finally we note that realistic stars have densities @xmath358 that globally decrease as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "it would be expected that this decreasing density may work as a counter term to the relativistic pressure around the centre of the body [ see eq .",
    "( [ be1 ] ) ] .",
    "it would be of interest to see whether thin - shell solutions are present in such realistic cases with strong gravitational backgrounds .",
