    "searches for effects of non - standard interactions ( nsi ) of neutrinos is one of the avenues to uncover new physics beyond the standard model ( see @xcite for review ) .",

    "they can affect neutrino propagation in medium modifying the standard oscillation pattern .",
    "the nsi effects in production ( absorption ) and in propagation may , or may not , be related and interplay of these effects is possible .    at the phenomenological level the nsi of neutrinos",
    "are described by the strength parameters , @xmath1 , which enter the effective potentials @xmath4 generated by the coherent @xmath5 forward scattering .",

    "effects of nsi in the atmospheric neutrinos have been considered in a number of publications before ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . also , the effect of nsi on propagation of accelerators , solar and supernova neutrinos have been studied ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , using various restrictions  @xcite derived from oscillation data , neutrino scattering off charged leptons and quarks , lepton flavor violating processes and electron - positron scattering the following model - independent bounds on the nsi strength parameters have been obtained in  @xcite : @xmath12    the super - kamiokande collaboration performed a dedicated experimental search of nsi in the atmospheric neutrinos crossing the earth  @xcite .",

    "it was shown that , due to the high efficiency in detection of low energy ( @xmath16  gev ) atmospheric neutrinos , pingu may have good sensitivity to @xmath17 .",
    "it is expected that nsi produce sub - leading effects in flavor oscillations of neutrinos . however , in certain situations their effects can dominate or be enhanced .",
    "it is well - known that the standard oscillations in matter disappear with increase of neutrino energy .",
    "indeed , for the @xmath18oscillation modes , the mixing in matter decreases with energy as @xmath19 , although the oscillation length converges to the refraction length which is comparable to the earth s radius .",
    "in contrast , for the @xmath0 and @xmath20 modes at high energies the mixing angle is unsuppressed .",
    "however , in this case the oscillation length ( which nearly coincides with the vacuum oscillation length ) increases with energy and becomes much bigger than the size of the earth .",

    "the situation can be different , if the off - diagonal elements are nonzero . in this case oscillations",
    "do not disappear with increase of the neutrino energy , and their characteristics will be determined by the matter part of hamiltonian .",
    "this means that appearance of oscillation effects at high energies will testify for nsi . at very high energies ( which are inversely proportional to @xmath21 )",
    "nsi dominate over standard oscillations and in this range their signal is simple and clear . on the other hand , in the range @xmath22 gev ,",

    "we studied effects of nsi on oscillations of the high energy ( @xmath23  gev ) atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the reason for that is that in general , the nsi effects do not disappear with increase of energy up to rather high energies .",
    "we focussed mainly on the @xmath328 sector .",

    "future measurements at deepcore and also at its upgrades will further improve the bounds .",
    "in particular , we showed that measurements of the energy and zenith angle distributions in deepcore will allow to strengthen limit by factor @xmath335 .",
    "the effects of nsi in the pingu detector have been studied in  @xcite . for @xmath336",
    "considered in  @xcite the region of strong nsi effect is at @xmath337  gev and so pingu indeed could have good sensitivity .",

    "we have shown how effects of nsi can be disentangled from effects of sterile neutrinos with mass in the ev range .",
    "the two effects have different energy dependencies .",
