    "at a hadron collider such as the tevatron at fermilab or the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , searches for new physics ( np ) states beyond the standard model ( sm ) must take into account the fact that partonic center of mass energies at these machines are not tunable ( as they will be at a much anticipated @xmath8 linear collider@xcite ) but vary continuously in principle from zero to the combined hadronic energies of approximately @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "moreover , many np models predict the production of a long - lived particle that is likely to escape the detectors , carrying away missing energy .",
    "the traditional method of seeing a np mass as a sharp resonance in a cross section is therefore not applicable , and we must consider other approaches to precision measurement of np masses crucial for testing properties of an underlying fundamental theory .",
    "one well - studied avenue is to construct invariant mass distributions of final jet or leptonic momenta in exclusive channels and study their endpoints .",
    "even if some np particles carry away missing energy in each event , endpoints of said distributions can be measured and matched to analytical functions of np masses@xcite .",
    "there are several caveats to this method however .",
    "first , the exclusive channel under study must somehow be identified or assumed .",
    "second , backgrounds must not interfere with endpoint measurement .",
    "third , there may be some model - dependence in the method of fitting the endpoint on a 1-dimensional histogram .",
    "the first caveat is the most difficult to deal with , especially in a model such as the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) , where the gluino and squarks decay via literally hundreds of possible decay chains(``cascades '' )",
    ". studies of cascades which have enough endpoints to solve for mssm masses , e.g. @xmath11 , usually just focus on a few benchmark scenarios@xcite which , however , may not be what nature chooses . as for eliminating sm backgrounds , requiring a suitable number of hard jets and isolated leptons may suffice ; np backgrounds are more challenging and , if these can be reduced , typically also inflict damage in the region of the desired endpoint where rates are already low , where @xmath12 are np particles , e.g. in the mssm @xmath13 . here the dilepton invariant mass distribution",
    "_ rises _ up to its endpoint and is therefore robust in the presence of diffuse backgrounds . ]",
    "this then brings up the third problem of how to fit the endpoint .",
    "linear or gaussian fits are most convenient , but very detailed study of cuts and detector effects are required to understand their general accuracy@xcite .    in this work",
    "we wish to show that there are two important features of np particle production which , when used together , can greatly boost the efficacy of the endpoint method .",
    "first , if np particles carry a new conserved charge , such as r - parity in the mssm , they will be multiply - produced .",
    "we may , for example , consider inclusive decay chains of the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are np states and @xmath17 is any system of particles with a sufficiently large total invariant mass : @xmath18 ( the case where @xmath19 is especially important and we designate this ` threshold production . ' ) .",
    "since @xmath17 usually includes at least one multi - particle system , @xmath20 really is continuously - valued from the threshold value all the way up to the machine energy .",
    "second , depending on @xmath20 and the exact way in which @xmath21 decay to the specified endstate , invariant masses constructed from the final jet and lepton momenta attain endpoint values for certain kinematic configurations only . at threshold production , in particular , one special configuration will simultaneously maximize several invariant masses ; collecting a large number of threshold decays , a 2-d or 3-d scatter plot of these invariants would exhibit a clustering around this ` threshold point . '",
    "yet threshold production is clearly only an infinitesimal possibility and superimposing events for ` above - threshold ' production ( @xmath22 ) would probably hide the threshold point ( hereafter called a ` hidden threshold ' ) .",
    "contrary to this intuition , however , we find that , for some invariant mass combinations , the hidden threshold is highly visible , being in fact fortified by above - threshold events .",
    "this allows us to directly measure values of threshold invariant mass endpoints which , as usual , can be used to constrain np masses .",
    "moreover , backgrounds should not be a problem since these have different invariant - mass correlations .",
    "the precise mechanism of this hidden threshold ( ht ) technique is best illustrated by example , which in this work we take to be @xmath23 i.e. neutralino pair - production ( via any parent channel ) and decay to leptons ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "section [ sec : invmass ] explains the basic ht theory in this case , followed in section [ sec : mc ] by application to monte carlo ( mc ) generated data simulating a low - luminosity(@xmath25 ) run at the lhc for two different mssm parameter points : one with on - shell slepton decays , and another with off - shell decays .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conc ] summarizes these results and suggests many avenues for further application .",
    "let us explain the ht technique in three steps , the first of which will be the case where @xmath17 in ( [ zizjdecay ] ) is a single particle which therefore has a fixed mass , say a heavy higgs boson ( @xmath26 or @xmath15 , hereafter designated higgs ) : @xmath27 for now , let us take the intermediate sleptons to be on - shell ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : off ] below for the case of off - shell decays ) .",
    "we studied this decay chain in @xcite , and for the convenience of the reader we briefly recapitulate . from the four observable final lepton momenta in ( [ hdecay ] )",
    ", one can define seven independent invariant mass combinations .",
    "these we defined as follows ( leptons labelled as @xmath28 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : kin ] ) : @xmath29    adding the usual dilepton invariants @xmath30 and @xmath31 to this list , we studied all distributions ( 1-d histograms ) and derived analytic formulae for their associated endpoints ( see @xcite for exact expressions , too lengthy to reproduce here ) . in mc simulations of lhc data ( assuming a luminosity of @xmath32 ) at several mssm points where both neutralinos and both sleptons were degenerate , endpoint precisions were not high enough to give better than 30% determination of the unknown masses @xmath33 ( hereafter we abbreviate @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) .",
    "this rather unexpectedly poor resolution from a seemingly over - constrained system(seven ; however , we could numerically see it did not make a difference . ]",
    "constraints on four unknowns ) owes to the highly non - linear form of the endpoint formulae , which generically yield a discrete set of solutions  adding in smearing and detector effects melds this discrete set into the large continuous range quoted .",
    "however , if one of the masses were already known to 5% accuracy , the degeneracy of the solutions breaks and the other three masses are likewise well - determined . though our choice of invariants in ( [ avinv1])-([avinv2 ] ) is somewhat more complicated ( yet more systematic ) than is customary ,",
    "the above is nonetheless a standard illustration of the usual invariant mass endpoint method .",
    "next , we consider what happens if the two neutralinos in ( [ hdecay ] ) are produced at threshold . ] , that is when @xmath36 exactly . now , it turns out , five of the invariants defined above ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 ) , in addition to @xmath30 and @xmath42 , are simultaneously maximal when the kinematic configuration shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : kin ] is realized .",
    "cm    with a suitably large sample of events , we need only plot one invariant against another to get its maximal value , as shown in figure [ fig : theory1 ] .",
    "note that the endpoints tend to lie at a fairly triangular apex , therefore well - approximated as the intersection of two tangents to the ` correlation shape ' .",
    "moreover , this correlation retains its shape in the presence of backgrounds , since these latter do not have the correct correlations among the various invariants and would tend to form a diffuse halo around the more concentrated signal shape . compared to the traditional one - dimensional histogram approach , where backgrounds are harder to subtract and endpoints must be fit with a more arbitrary function , the reader can begin to appreciate that a technique using correlated invariants is much more powerful .",
    "though this case of threshold production is not particularly likely in the mssm , it prepares us for the next step .    ) .",
    "this simulation is purely from relativistic kinematics with @xmath43 ( units arbitrary ) .",
    "dashed lines mark the maximum value of each invariant .",

    "] choices of invariants : threshold decays are plotted in gray , while all above - threshold decays are plotted in black of these on top of @xmath50 above - threshold events . ] .",
    "the key observation to make here is that the threshold points p(q ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : theory2]a(b ) are not at all obscured when above - threshold events are superimposed ; in fact , these latter serve to graphically reinforce the threshold points , located on the envelope of the collective shape .",
    "it should be clear , however , that without our color - coding in fig .",
    "[ fig : theory2](a , b ) , it is not possible to tell the exact position of p and q only . ]",
    "nevertheless , p and q share a tight relationship : namely , they must uniquely identify the three endpoints @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , this last of which is obtainable from a wedgebox plot@xcite , i.e. a plot of @xmath54 .",
    "we can therefore find the precise locations of p and q with a graphical device : superimpose a plot of @xmath55 with one of @xmath56 ( i.e. superimpose fig .  [",
    "fig : theory2]a and fig .",
    "[ fig : theory2]b with swapped and rescaled axes ) .",
    "this gives rise to a characteristic cat - eye shape(figure [ fig : theory2]c ) , where the upper corner of the eye pinpoints the correct threshold extrema of @xmath37 and @xmath40 .",
    "there is another very useful correlation here , namely @xmath47 ( see previous footnote for alternatives ) .",
    "analogous to the situation in fig .",
    "[ fig : theory2]a and fig .",
    "[ fig : theory2]b , threshold values of @xmath52 and @xmath57 for this @xmath58 decay again lie on the envelope of the correlation shape at point ` x ' in fig .",
    "[ fig : theory2]d ; what is more interesting , every point on the envelope _ above _ x ( say , ` y ' in fig .",
    "[ fig : theory2]d ) corresponds to another set of @xmath59 and @xmath60 for a decay @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are some hypothetical set of heavier particles ( @xmath64 ) which follow the same decay chain through an on - shell slepton to leptons and the lsp . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath62 and @xmath63 really were produced , they would have decay kinematics leading precisely to the endpoints identified at y ( we will call this a ` pseudo - threshold ' ) .",
    "every such pseudo - threshold therefore yields a set of endpoints @xmath59 and @xmath60 which can be used to constrain @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 ( where without loss of generality we can take @xmath68 ) , this latter being merely an auxiliary parameter at each such point .",

    "points p and q in ( a ) and ( b ) identify threshold endpoints ; these can be found precisely with a ` cat - eye ' plot in ( c ) , where we have abbreviated @xmath70 . in ( d )",
    "we show another useful correlation of invariants which not only gives threshold endpoints at x , but also ` pseudo - threshold ' endpoints at any point y higher up on the envelope .",
    "_ , width=432 ]    -4.0 cm    now there is really no difference between this situation with a continuously - massed higgs and that of the decay ( [ zizjdecay ] ) , or more specifically @xmath71 where @xmath17 could be @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 etc . , or any two susy particles with a continuous center of mass energy greater than or equal to @xmath77 , while @xmath78 are any collection of particles , e.g. hadronic jets , that do not confuse the 4-lepton signal .",
    "as long as the neutralino - pair subchains are intact , the mother chain is irrelevant .",
    "note also we do not require the lightest neutralino to be stable , as long as its decay products do not include leptons .",
    "as we shall see in the next section this technique works very well in mc simulations with a minimal requirement of four isolated leptons plus missing energy .",
    "in this section we demonstrate the robustness of our technique at two different mssm parameter points with varying decay topologies .",
    "our mc setup uses herwig 6.5 and private codes as in our previous publications @xcite and the reader is referred to these for details .",
    "we generate events @xmath79 for @xmath80(a low - luminosity year at the lhc ) and only pass those which decay to a hard and isolated @xmath8 and @xmath81 pair with sufficient missing energy(@xmath82 ) .",
    "this eliminates sm backgrounds aside from @xmath83 , though this can be modeled and subtracted ( by a z - veto if necessary , which happens to work perfectly at the parameter points we will consider ) .",
    "susy backgrounds fall into two categories : those which produce exactly four leptons and those which produce more than this ( presumably losing some to isolation cuts , detector effects , etc . ) .",
    "the first category includes slepton or chargino ` 3 + 1 ' decays such as @xmath84 where one decay goes to three leptons and the other to one .",
    "these could always be substantially reduced via flavor subtraction , but this is not necessary since they have totally different kinematics from a ` 2 + 2 ' decay ( i.e. ( [ zizjdecay2 ] ) ) and should not obscure the envelopes in plots such as fig .  [",
    "fig : theory2 ] . moreover",
    ", such decays would exhibit their own characteristic correlation shapes in addition to the trilepton invariant mass edge . in the worst case ,",
    "then , four - lepton susy backgrounds should be considered an ` enriched signal . '",
    "the second category of susy backgrounds includes events such as @xmath85 where each stau decays @xmath86 and two of the total of six leptons are somehow lost . yet such events , if not made utterly small by leptonic branching fractions , would introduce a more - or - less diffuse halo in our correlation plots , and in particular should not confuse the identification of threshold points .",
    "the most basic illustration of the ht technique for the decay ( [ zizjdecay2 ] ) is when only one particular @xmath87-combination has a significant branching ratio ; if , in addition , @xmath88 , threshold endpoint formulae simplify dramatically , e.g. @xmath89 a @xmath90 pair , for example , is often the chief product of colored cascades at msugra points such as sps1a@xcite . though we have checked our technique works at sps1a , we choose another point which has higher rates and therefore better demonstrates the agreement with theory presented in the last section :    on - shell point : :    @xmath91    here we have raised the left - handed slepton and stau soft mass inputs above those of the right - handed selectron and smuon ( note the physical masses differ slightly from these , see table [ tab : mass ] ) to suppress sneutrino exchange and stau modes which may reduce the magnitude of ( but not character of ) the signal .",

    "_ in our case this was @xmath95 where each neutralino then decayed via a slepton to a pair of leptons and the lsp .",

    "_    let us add a few remarks on these three steps .",
    "the first step depends of course on the specific np model under consideration , but once a decay chain has been selected , deriving analytical formulae for endpoints in the second step is not difficult : the sought - after kinematic configuration is usually where each jet or lepton is emitted at a polar angle of @xmath104 or @xmath105 or perhaps @xmath106 ( for minima ) in the frame of the decaying parent particle , backwards lorentz - boosting to the center - of - mass frame ( see appendix of @xcite for an example ) .",
