    "in recent years the icecube collaboration has opened the era of neutrino astronomy and announced the detection of @xmath2 extraterrestrial neutrinos above @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a preliminary analysis  @xcite , based on four years of data , rose the total number of high - energy starting events ( hese ) to @xmath4 .",
    "the astrophysical spectrum inferred by icecube on the basis on the three - year data set was fitted by a power law with index @xmath5 above 60 tev  @xcite , while the four - year data favor a steeper spectrum : @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "although a statistically significant departure from isotropy can not be claimed yet , a recent analysis  @xcite showed that the angular distribution of hese events allows up to @xmath7 of the full - sky astrophysical flux to have a galactic origin .",
    "moreover , a hint of a harder spectrum in the northern hemisphere may be suggested by a recent analysis  @xcite .    the galaxy , indeed , is a guaranteed source of neutrinos up to a fraction of pev energies at least .",
    "a sizable flux may either come from freshly accelerated cosmic rays ( crs ) undergoing hadronic scattering with gas clumps , or from the hadronic interactions between the galactic cr sea and the diffuse gas .    the former scenario ,",
    "however , can not explain the steepness of the neutrino spectrum measured by icecube and is in tension with _",
    "fermi_-lat upper limit on the corresponding @xmath0-ray emission  @xcite .     in the latter , instead ,",
    "if the local cr spectrum is assumed to be representative of the entire galactic population , the computed spectrum should be significantly lower than the measured spectrum  @xcite ( see also  @xcite : the authors show that only @xmath8 of the hese can be accounted in that way , under the conventional assumption that the same cr transport properties hold throughout the whole galaxy ) .    however , it is conceivable that cr diffusion  due to a stronger star forming activity and peculiar magnetic field strength / geometry  behaves differently in the inner galactic region .",
    "several anomalies observed in the @xmath0-ray diffuse emission support this possibility .",
    "we start by noting that conventional models can not explain the large @xmath0-ray flux measured by the milagro observatory from the inner gp region at @xmath9 median energy  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : milagro ] we show how a representative conventional model , with similar spectral properties as the _ fermi _ benchmark model @xcite , clearly fails to reproduce that measurement .",
    "this problem is common to all the models of this kind and still holds assuming  as done in  @xcite  that the spectral hardening found by pamela in the cr proton and helium spectra above @xmath10  @xcite is present throughout the whole galaxy .",
    "therefore , the milagro excess is still an open issue , and indeed its possible relevance for high - energy neutrino physics has often been pointed out ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "an even more serious anomaly was found at lower energies in the _",
    "fermi_-lat diffuse @xmath0-ray spectrum  @xcite : the conventional models systematically underestimate the measured flux in the inner gp region above a few gev .",
    "a new phenomenological scenario was proposed in  @xcite in order to account for the latter results : the idea is to consider a radial dependence for both the rigidity scaling index @xmath11 of the diffusion coefficient and the advective wind .",
    "-ray spectrum from the inner galactic plane ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) computed for the reference models considered in this letter is compared with _ fermi_-lat and milagro data .",
    "the milagro differential flux reported here is 17% lower with respect to the flux reported in 2008 ( @xcite ) due to the assumption of a spectral index of 2.4 instead of 2.7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the expected sensitivities of hawc  @xcite and cta @xcite are reported .",
    "the spectral components are shown for the kra@xmath14 model only .",
    "fermi_-lat data points refer to 5 years of data , within the event class ultraclean , according to _ fermi _ tools v9r32p5.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in this letter we present for the first time a consistent picture based on that scenario that aims to overcome all of the aforementioned problems .",
    "the most significant achievements we present are :    * a natural explanation to the long - standing milagro anomaly ; * a new prediction of the galactic neutrino diffuse emission that is significantly larger than the one computed with conventional models ; and * a possible interpretation for the hints of an excess of icecube events along the galactic plane and of the different neutrino slope in the northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "following @xcite , the starting point is a conventional propagation setup characterized by @xmath15 is defined by @xmath16 , compatible with a kraichnan spectrum of the interstellar turbulence within the quasi - linear theory framework .",
    "we will refer to this setup as the `` kra model '' ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the new model presented in that paper features @xmath11 increasing with the galactocentric radius @xmath17 ( implying spatially variable cr transport as originally suggested , e.g. , in  @xcite ) , and hence predicts a hardening of cr propagated spectrum and @xmath0-ray emissivity in the inner galaxy .",
    "the following explains the model in more detail :    * @xmath11 has the galactocentric radial dependence @xmath18 for @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 so that @xmath22 .",
    "this behavior may have different physical interpretations , e.g. a smooth transition between a dominant parallel escape along the poloidal component of the regular galactic magnetic field ( in the inner galaxy , where @xmath11 is lower ) and a perpendicular escape with respect to the regular field lying in the plane ( in the outer galaxy , where the scaling is steeper ) .",
    "* an advective wind for @xmath23 with velocity @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the distance from the gp ) vanishing at @xmath26 and growing as @xmath27 is also included .",
    "this ingredient is motivated by the x - ray rosat observations  @xcite * the vertical dependence of the diffusion coefficient is taken as @xmath28 ; * the halo size is @xmath29 for all values of @xmath17 ( this is a conventional choice widely used in the literature , and we checked that our results do not change significantly considering larger values of @xmath30 ) .",
    "the observed @xmath0-ray spectra at both low and mid galactic latitudes , including the galactic center , are reproduced by this model without spoiling local cr observables : proton , antiproton and helium spectra , b / c and @xmath31be/@xmath32be ratios . moreover",
    ", this scenario naturally accounts for the radial dependence in the cr spectrum found by the fermi collaboration  @xcite",
    ". we will refer to this model as `` kra@xmath33 '' since it is tuned on gamma - ray data .",
    "we implement the setup with dragon , a numerical code designed to compute the propagation of all cr species  @xcite . while the current version of the code shares with galprop  @xcite the same spallation cross - section routines and the gas distribution ,",
    "its innovative structure allows us to compute cr transport in the general framework of position - dependent diffusion .    concerning the @xmath34 and he",
    "spectral hardening inferred from pamela  @xcite - recently confirmed by ams-02",
    "@xcite - and cream  @xcite data above @xmath35 , we consider two alternatives . _",
    "1 ) local hardening _",
    "could originate from nearby supernova remnants ( see e.g.  @xcite ) ; since this is a stochastic effect and averages out on large scales it amounts to not introducing any feature in the galactic cr population used in this work .",
    "_ 2 ) global hardening _ could originate from a spectral feature in the rigidity dependence of cr source spectra or the diffusion coefficient ( here we only consider the former case , as both scenarios have the same effect on the @xmath0-ray diffuse emission ) . in both cases",
    "we assume that above 250 gev / n the cr source spectra extend steadily up to an exponential cutoff at the energy @xmath36 .",
    "we consider two representative values of this quantity , namely @xmath37 and @xmath38 pev which - for the kra@xmath14 setup - match cream _ p _ and he data and roughly bracket kascade  @xcite and kascade - grande data  @xcite .",
    "while kascade proton data favor the lowest cutoff , the highest is favored by the kascade - grande all - particle spectrum",
    ". a more detailed fit of the cr spectra in the pev region is not justified here due to the large experimental uncertainties on the elemental spectral shapes and normalizations .",
    "the consequent uncertainty on the neutrino flux should , however , be well captured by our choice to consider a range of cutoffs .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the kra@xmath14 setup  both in its _ local _ ( kra@xmath33 with no hardening ) and _ global _ realizations  provides a good fit of the @xmath0-ray diffuse emission measured by _",
    "fermi_-lat all over the sky , particularly toward the inner gp region . moreover , it accounts for the galactocentric radial dependence of the cr spectral index found by the _",
    "fermi_-lat collaboration  @xcite . here",
    "we extend the computation performed in @xcite above the tev .",
    "similar to  @xcite , we compute the hadronic emission integrating the expression of the @xmath0-ray emissivity along the line of sight using gammasky , a dedicated code used in  @xcite to simulate diffuse @xmath0-ray maps .",
    "this package features , among other options , the gas maps included in the public version of galprop  @xcite .",
    "we adopt the emissivities given in  @xcite , accounting for the energy dependence of the @xmath39 inelastic cross section ( significant above the tev ) .",
    "we disregard @xmath0-ray opacity due to the interstellar radiation field , since it is negligible up to a few tens of tev  @xcite .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : milagro ] . as mentioned in the above , a representative conventional model ( kra ) can not account for the flux measured by milagro from the inner gp at @xmath40 tev even if accounting for the cr spectral hardening required to match the pamela and cream data .",
    "the kra@xmath14 setup , instead , is more successful , especially if a global hardening is assumed . this is a remarkable result since : _",
    "1 ) _ it supports the kra@xmath14 model in a higher - energy regime ; _ 2 ) _ it provides the first consistent interpretation of milagro and _ fermi_-lat results ( an _ optimized _ model was proposed to account for the egret gev excess @xcite , and came out to reproduce milagro results as well , but was subsequently excluded by _",
    "@xcite ) , and _ 3 ) _ it reinforces the arguments in favor of a non - local origin of the hardening in the cr spectra above 250 gev .",
    "interestingly , the kra@xmath14 model also reproduces the high - energy diffuse @xmath0-ray spectrum measured by h.e.s.s . in the galactic ridge region ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) in terms of cr scattering with the dense gas in the central molecular zone without the need to invoke the contribution of sources to that region  @xcite and without further tuning ( see  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "although this is a very small region with respect to the regions considered in this paper , this result may be interpreted as a valuable check of our model in a region not covered by milagro moreover , our kra@xmath33 model is also compatible with argo - ybj results in the window @xmath43 and @xmath44 ; both the kra and the kra@xmath33 are consistent with casa - mia measurements at high galactic longitudes  @xcite .",
    "the results discussed above clearly show that the hadronic emission computed with the kra@xmath14 setup above the tev is significantly stronger than the conventional model predictions . in this section",
    "we show the relevant consequences concerning the galactic neutrino emission .",
    "we first compute the @xmath45 and @xmath46 production spectra : for both flavors we use the emissivities provided in  @xcite ( well tuned on accelerator and cr data ) for projectile energies below @xmath47 tev , while we adopt the emissivities provided in @xcite that are above that energy range",
    ". then we account for neutrino oscillations : their effect is to almost equally redistribute the composition among the three flavors  @xcite .",
    "we only consider proton and helium crs / gas  as for @xmath0-rays  since heavier nuclear species give a negligible contribution in the energy range we cover in this work  @xcite .    )",
    "models for two different cutoff values .",
    "we also show the maximal flux , estimated considering three years of icecube hese events as described in @xcite , the constraint from the antares experiment  @xcite ( 1500 days of experiment livetime between 2007 and 2013 ) as well as the deduced sensitivity of the future mediterranean observatory km3net  @xcite with four years ( @xmath48 1500 days ) of livetime .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    because neutrinos in the galactic emission are expected to be maximal in the inner galactic plane region , we first present our results for the window @xmath49 and @xmath50 . for this region the antares collaboration  @xcite recently released an upper limit on the muon neutrino flux based on the result of an unblinding analysis regarding the events collected between 2007 and 2013 in the energy range [ @xmath51 tev  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nu_gal_plane ] we compare the @xmath46 flux computed with the kra and kra@xmath14 setups with the flux of the experimental constraint .",
    "first of all we notice the large enhancement ( almost a factor of 5 at 100 tev ) obtained with the kra@xmath14 model with respect to the conventional scenario . indeed , while  in agreement with previous results",
    " we find that the flux corresponding to the kra model may require long times of observation even by the km3net observatory  @xcite , our prediction for the kra@xmath14 model is instead well above the sensitivity reachable by that experiment in four years and it is almost within the antares observation capabilities .",
    "interestingly , our result is in good agreement with the maximal flux inferred from the fraction of icecube hese events compatible with that region ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : nu_spectra ] ) .",
    "we notice that in that region the expected eg contribution , as constrained from the muon neutrino flux in the northern hemisphere ( see below ) gives a subdominant contribution with respect to that computed with the kra@xmath14 model .",
    "therefore the possible detection of a signal in that sky window would be a smoking gun for the presence of such galactic emission .",
    "icecube should also have the potential to detect that emission on a larger region . in this context",
    ", we also note that an independent analysis @xcite already found a significant hint of an excess in the 4-year hese sample  @xcite along the galactic plane .     and kra models ( with global cr hardening ) , adopting two different choices for the cr high - energy cutoff .",
    "we also plot the combination of the galactic ( kra@xmath14 ) and a benchmark eg spectrum .",
    "the eg flux is consistent with that inferred from the icecube collaboration in the northern hemisphere  @xcite .",
    "the models are compared with the 68% confidence region for the icecube astrophysical neutrino flux obtained with a maximum - likelihood ( yellow region )  @xcite and the three years hese ( green points )  @xcite .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we now turn our attention to the recently published icecube results , both concerning the full - sky and the northern and southern hemispheres separately .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nu_spectra ] we represent the full - sky total neutrino spectrum ( all flavors , including antiparticles ) computed for the kra@xmath14 and kra models , with global cr hardening , and compare it to the icecube results .",
    "our prediction for the conventional setup ( kra model ) is in good agreement with  @xcite : in that work , the benchmark galactic model accounts for @xmath52% of the flux measured by icecube above @xmath53 tev , for a cr spectrum similar to the one used here above @xmath38 pev .    on the other hand ,",
    "the kra@xmath14 predicts a @xmath54 times larger full - sky flux above @xmath55 tev : the model prediction is therefore only @xmath56 times smaller than the best fit of the astrophysical flux measured by icecube on the whole sky .",
    "we remark that another analysis  @xcite , based on an extrapolation of _ fermi_-lat data , points toward a non - negligible galactic contribution to the full - sky neutrino flux due to a hard diffuse cr spectrum . in that scenario",
    "the ( softer ) locally observed cr spectrum may get a major contribution from one or more local sources : this interpretation still has to be validated against _ fermi_-lat data , while our model is based on those measurements .",
    "setting a threshold energy at @xmath53 tev and convolving the kra@xmath14 spectrum ( with @xmath57 pev ) with the icecube hese effective areas  @xcite , the expected number of neutrino events in three years of icecube observation represents @xmath58 of the published sample  @xcite .",
    "these rates are well above those expected due to atmospheric muons and atmospheric neutrinos and confirm the spectral comparison between kra@xmath14 and icecube data .",
    "clearly , another component  most likely of extragalactic ( eg ) origin  needs to be invoked in order to account for all of the icecube events .",
    "here we assume this eg component to be isotropic and use the astrophysical muon neutrino icecube measurements from the northern hemisphere  @xcite  where the galactic emission is only @xmath59 of the total flux  to probe its spectral properties .",
    "although the northern spectral slope is statistically compatible with the full - sky one , given the hint of a steeper spectrum in the southern hemisphere , it is interesting to check if the combination of our galactic prediction and the eg flux inferred from the aforementioned muon neutrino measurement provide a better agreement with the data .    for illustrative purposes , in fig .",
    "[ fig : nu_spectra ] we show the effect of adding an isotropic eg emission to the galactic neutrino emission computed with the kra@xmath33 model , with a spectrum given by the icecube best fit of @xmath60 , multiplied by three to account for all flavors .",
    "the nature of such emission is still under debate : as pointed out in @xcite and @xcite , neither blazars nor star - forming galaxies can provide more than a subdominant contribution , given the constraints imposed by the gamma - ray extragalactic background inferred from _ fermi_-lat data .",
    "the plot clearly shows how the kra@xmath33 helps to improve the fit in the low - energy part of the icecube spectrum .",
    "we also checked that the neutrino flux computed with the kra@xmath14 model for @xmath61 is in rather good agreement with that inferred from icecube hese analysis if the eg emission , as estimated above , is accounted for .",
    "a dedicated analysis will be performed in a forthcoming work .",
    "in this letter we connected @xmath0-ray gev and tev measurements in a unified scenario , together with the recently released icecube neutrino data , providing a consistent picture based on a cr transport model proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the model features a variation of the diffusion coefficient rigidity scaling @xmath11 with galactocentric radius .",
    "the variation was suggested by a spectral anomaly found in the _",
    "fermi_-lat @xmath0-ray data , and turned out to be compatible with both @xmath0-ray spectra at low and intermediate galactic latitude and local cr observables .    in this work we showed that our picture sheds new light on high - energy gamma - ray and neutrino recent observations .",
    "in particular , it provides a novel natural explanation for the anomalous @xmath0-ray flux measured by the milagro observatory from the inner gp region at @xmath9 ; moreover , it appears to be compatible with the h.e.s.s .",
    "spectrum in the galactic ridge region .",
    "remarkably , our model also provides a different interpretation of the full - sky neutrino spectrum measured by icecube with respect to the standard lore , since it predicts a larger contribution of the galactic neutrinos to the total flux , compared to conventional models",
    ".    these predictions will be testable in the near future by neutrino observatories such as antares , km3net , and icecube itself via dedicated analyses that are focused on the galactic plane , and also by analyzing the different spectral slopes in the northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "a hint of a softer slope in the northern hemisphere is already present , and appears to be compatible with our picture .",
    "a physical interpretation of our model most likely requires either abandoning the isotropic diffusion scenario generally adopted to treat cr propagation , or considering different turbulence regimes in different regions of the galaxy : a quantitative modeling of those phenomena is far beyond the scope of our phenomenological work .",
