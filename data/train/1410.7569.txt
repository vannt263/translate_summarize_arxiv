    "it is worth noticing than neither of these properties suffices to obtain an upper bound on the smallest cardinality of generators of a finite group @xmath0 .",
    "clearly any finite group @xmath0 contains an invariable generating set ( consider the set of representatives of each of the conjugacy classes ) .",
    "moreover for every @xmath15 there exists a finite ( supersoluble ) group @xmath0 with the property that @xmath16 and @xmath0 can be generated with @xmath17 elements of coprime order ( see proposition [ supersoluble ] ) .    for general @xmath0 ,",

    "if @xmath0 is soluble , then @xmath19 .",
    "a motivation for our interest in coprime invariable generation is the fact that this property is satisfied by finite groups without proper subgroups of the same exponent ( we will call these groups _ minimal exponent groups _ ) .",
    "indeed , assume that @xmath0 is a minimal exponent group with @xmath20 .",

    "in particular , as a corollary of theorems  [ 3 ] and [ soluble ] , we deduce a result already proved in @xcite and @xcite : a finite group @xmath0 contains a 3-generated subgroup @xmath28 with @xmath29 and if @xmath0 is soluble there exists indeed a 2-generated subgroup @xmath28 of @xmath0 with @xmath30    notice that the example given in proposition  [ a_5 ] of a coprimely invariably generated group @xmath0 which is not 2-generated is not minimal exponent . indeed , the property of being minimal exponent is much stronger than coprime invariable generation .",
    "whereas the bound @xmath31 in theorem  [ 3 ] can not be improved , we have no example of a finite minimal exponent group @xmath0 which can not be generated by 2 elements and the following interesting question is open : _ is it true that any finite group @xmath0 contains a 2-generated proper subgroup with the same exponent ?",

    "if @xmath49 is non - abelian , then arguing as in the proof of the non - abelian case of theorem [ 3 ] , we conclude that @xmath252 thus again @xmath253 .",
    "we make use of the invariable generators given in @xcite , where it is proved that every finite simple group is invariably generated by two elements . for the classical groups , the orders given in @xcite are for the quasisimple groups ,",
