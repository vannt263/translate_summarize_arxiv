    "the purpose of this paper is to develop the formalism of the discrete phase integral ( dpi ) , or wentzel - kramers - brillouin method , for cases where the recursion relation involves five terms .",
    "previous use of this method has , as far as we are aware , been limited to three - term recursion relations @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the extension to five terms is not routine , and entails novel physical and mathematical considerations .",
    "further , once this extension is understood , no additional concepts are required in dealing with recursion relations involving still more terms .    the physical problem which led the author to consider this extension concerns the magnetic molecular cluster @xcite [ ( tacn)@xmath1fe@xmath0o@xmath2(oh)@xmath3@xmath4 ( or just 8 for short ) .",
    "this molecule has a total spin @xmath5 in its ground state , and crystallizes into a solid where the cluster has an approximate @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "the interaction between molecules is very weak , and the low temperature spin dynamics of a single molecule are well described by the hamiltonian = -k_2 j_z^2 + ( k_1 - k_2 ) j_x^2 - g_b . [ ham ] here , @xmath7 is a dimensionless spin operator , @xmath8 is an externally applied magnetic field , and @xmath9 .",
    "( experiments reveal @xmath10 k , and @xmath11 k. )    the spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) shows some extremely interesting features as a function of the applied field @xmath8 . in particular , one finds a large number of diabolical points @xcite in the @xmath12-@xmath13 plane @xcite , which have also been seen experimentally @xcite .",
    "exactly as in the spectrum of a particle confined to a triangular box @xcite , some of the diabolical points ( those arising when @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) can be related to a geometrical symmetry @xcite , but others can not .",
    "the problem was first studied @xcite by instanton methods when @xmath16 , but this method is much harder to apply for general field orientations , and the phase integral method proves to be simpler .",
    "the existence of diabolical points turns out to depend critically on having five terms in the recursion relation that we shall describe shortly , and three terms would never lead to such points .",
    "the calculations which pertain specifically to 8 are described elsewhere @xcite , but it seems worthwhile to present the formal aspects of the work separately , as they are more generally applicable .",
    "it is useful to continue with the above example in order to introduce the dpi method .",
    "the starting point of the procedure is to write schrdinger s equation in the @xmath17 basis .",
    "let @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "n = m-2^m+2 t_m , n c_n = e c_m .",
    "[ seq ] the diagonal terms ( @xmath22 ) in the above equation arise from the @xmath23 and @xmath24 parts of @xmath25 , those off - diagonal by one ( @xmath26 ) from the @xmath27 and @xmath28 parts , and those off - diagonal by two ( @xmath29 ) from the @xmath30 part .",
    "the dpi method is applicable to a recursion relation such as ( [ seq ] ) whenever the @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) vary sufficiently slowly with @xmath33 .",
    "a physical analogy may be made with an electron hopping on a lattice with on - site energies @xmath22 and nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor hopping terms @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "if these quantities were independent of @xmath33 , the solutions to would be bloch waves @xmath36 , with an energy e = w_m + 2 t_m , m+1 q + 2 t_m , m+2 2q e(q ) , [ evsq ] where we have written @xmath37 to highlight the physically different role of the on - site energy from the hopping terms .",
    "we shall use the notations @xmath38 and @xmath22 interchangably .",
    "if for fixed @xmath39 , the @xmath40 vary slowly with @xmath33 ( where the meaning of this term remains to be made precise ) , we expect it to be a good approximation to introduce a local bloch wavevector , @xmath41 , and write @xmath42 as an exponential @xmath43 , whose phase @xmath44 accumulates approximately as the integral of @xmath41 with increasing @xmath33 , in exactly the same way that in the continuum quasiclassical method in one dimension , one writes the wavefunction as @xmath45 , and approximates @xmath46 as the integral of the local momentum @xmath47 .",
    "it is obvious that the above approximation will entail the replacement of various sums by integrals , and to that end , we introduce smooth functions @xmath48 of a continuous variable @xmath33 as extensions of @xmath49 such that whenever @xmath33 is an integer @xcite , t_(m ) = ( t_m , m+ + t_m , m-)/2 , = 0,1,2 .",
    "[ tcont ] we will try and choose these functions so that their derivatives are small . the precise way in which this is to be done will be discussed later , but supposing that we have been successful in finding such functions , we can seek to approximate @xmath42 in exact parallel with the continuum phase integral approach .",

    "[ vm ] the interpretation of these equations is exactly the same as in the continuum case .",

    "the presence of the lattice shows up in the @xmath52 dependence of @xmath51 through periodic functions , whereas in the continuum case , such dependence is typically of the form @xmath53 .",
    "as discussed by braun @xcite , the dpi approximation has been employed in many problems in quantum mechanics where the schrdinger equation turns into a three - term recursion relation in a suitable basis .",
    "all the types of problems as in the continuum case in can then be treated ",
    "bohr - sommerfeld quantization , barrier penetration , tunnel in symmetric double wells , etc .",
    "in addition , one can also use the method to give asymptotic solutions for various recursion relations of mathematical physics , such as those for the mathieu equation , hermite polynomials , bessel functions , and so on .",
    "the general procedures are well known and simple to state . for any @xmath54 ,",
    "one solves the hamilton - jacobi and transport equations to obtain @xmath41 and @xmath50 , and writes @xmath42 as a linear combinations of the independent solutions that result .",
    "the interesting features all arise from a single fact  that the dpi approximation breaks down at the so - called _ turning points_. these are points where @xmath50 vanishes .",
    "one must relate the dpi solutions on opposite sides of the turning point by connection formulas , and the solution of all the various types of problems mentioned above depends on judicious use of these formulas .",
    "in this paper we will extend these ideas to five - term recursion relations , focussing especially on those features which arise over and above the three - term problem .",
    "now , for any given @xmath54 , there will be _ four _ dpi solutions ( [ cwkb ] ) , while in the three - term case there are only two , because the hamilton - jacobi equation ( [ hjeq ] ) is a quartic in @xmath55 .",
    "these solutions will also break down at turning points ",
    "points where @xmath50 vanishes .",
    "in contrast to the three - term case , we shall see that there are new types of turning points .",
    "it is these turning points which are responsible for the diabolical points in the spectrum of 8 .",
    "the three - term problem turning points are analogous to those in the continuum quasiclassical method , but the new ones that we will find are not .",
    "in fact , they can only be described as lying  under the barrier \" from the continuum viewpoint .",
    "these new or _ irregular _ turning points require new connection formulas , which it is our goal to provide .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows .",
    "we will examine the dpi approximation carefully in , and see how it fails when @xmath50 vanishes .",
    "the precise width of the failure zone is discussed in an appendix .",
    "we will examine these failure or turning points in , and see how the concept must be extended beyond the three - term and continuum cases .",
    "we will find that a turning point need not be a limit of the classically allowed motion , and we will categorize the different types of turning points that arise .",
    "we will conclude in by deriving connection formulas at the new turning points .",
    "we will limit ourselves to problems where the matrix @xmath56 is real and symmetric , @xmath57 , as it simplifies the analysis , and yet suffices to bring out all essential physical points . in our spin example , this means that we only consider fields in the @xmath58-@xmath59 plane .",
    "the extension to complex hermitean matrices is cumbersome to carry through , but presents no difficulty of principle .",
    "we shall continue to couch our discussion in quantum mechanical language , thinking of @xmath54 as an energy eigenvalue , although from the mathematical viewpoint , this is not strictly necessary .",
    "in this section , we will examine the dpi approximation in more detail .",
    "the argument proceeds in close analogy with the continuum case .",
    "we begin by restating the approximation in a slightly different way @xcite . dividing by @xmath42 , and writing @xmath60",
    ", we get t_m , m-2_m-1 ^ -1 _ m^-1 + t_m , m-1_m^-1 + t_m , m + t_m , m+1_m+1 + t_m , m+2_m+1_m+2 = e. [ ratio ] if @xmath40 for fixed @xmath39 is almost the same over some range @xmath61 of @xmath33 s , then we will get almost the same numerical equation for the @xmath62 s over this range , and we will clearly obtain a good approximate solution if we replace ratios like @xmath63 by unity .",
    "this leads to t_m , m-2_m^-2 + t_m , m-1_m^-1 + t_m , m + t_m , m+1_m + t_m , m+2_m^2 = e , [ ratio2 ] which is a solvable quartic equation in @xmath62 ( which is exactly like the factor @xmath64 introduced in sec .",
    "[ intro ] ) .",
    "the corresponding approximation for @xmath42 is c_m _ k = m_a^m _ k , [ prod ] where @xmath65 is a suitable starting value .",
    "one could now use this approximation to find the ratio @xmath63 , substitute this value for the ratio in , and solve again for @xmath62 .",
    "the process could be further iterated if desired .",
    "the product in is more easily evaluated as a sum by taking logarithms .",
    "further , if the @xmath62 s do not vary rapidly from one @xmath33 to the next , the sum will be well approximated by an integral .",
    "this makes it necessary to introduce continuum extensions of the matrix elements @xmath40 .",
    "we turn therefore to this problem , and discuss the condition for slow variation more clearly .",
    "we are seeking functions @xmath48 such that @xcite t_(m ) = ( t_m , m+ + t_m , m-)/2 , ( = 0,1,2 ) , [ tcont2 ] whenever @xmath33 is an integer .",
    "there are infinitely many such functions , and we restrict them by imposing further conditions on a certain number of their higher derivatives . for @xmath66 ,",
    "e.g. , we could also demand ( using dots to denote derivatives with respect to @xmath33 ) , _",
    "1(m ) & = & t_m , m+1 - t_m , m-1 , [ dott1 ] + t_1(m ) & = & ( t_m+1,m+2 - t_m , m+1 - t_m , m-1 + t_m+1,m+2 ) .",
    "[ ddott1 ] similar conditions can be imposed on @xmath67 and @xmath66 . in general , we need conditions only up to some small order for practical applications .",
    "up to the degree of approximation in , e.g. , we need only go up to second derivatives .",
    "since the matrix elements are assumed to vary slowly , we want these derivatives to be small , and this condition is best codified in terms of a small parameter @xmath68 , which plays the same role as @xmath69 in the continuum case , such that @xmath70 is formally of order @xmath71 , @xmath72 of order @xmath68 , @xmath73 of order @xmath74 , and so on . for spin hamiltonians such as , this parameter is @xmath75 .",
    "the quasiclassicality conditions then read = o ( t_(m ) j , = o ( t_(m ) j^2 , [ slow ] etc .",
    "we will continue to use @xmath75 as a generic small parameter in the rest of our analysis . a problem in which one can not find functions @xmath48 obeying will not be amenable to a phase integral approximation .",
    "one small point should be kept in mind while judging orders of smallness in the spin problem , and others like it .",
    "there are natural algebraic expressions for the @xmath48 s in which @xmath33 appears only in the combination @xmath76 or @xmath77^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "thus , derivatives with respect to @xmath33 are automatically smaller by an order @xmath78 .",
    "as @xmath79 , however , the classical quantity is not @xmath33 , but @xmath76 . thus the ratio @xmath76 should be regarded as a quantity of order unity and not @xmath78 .",
    "with this lengthy preamble , we are ready to solve our recursion relation . as in the continuum case",
    ", we make the exponential substitution , c_m = e^i(m ) .",
    "[ eiphi ] the first approximation is obtained if we assume that @xmath80 varies slowly so that @xmath81 may be neglected .",
