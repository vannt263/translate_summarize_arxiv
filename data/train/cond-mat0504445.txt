    "recently , tiocl was proposed to be a quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xmath2 quantum spin system , that develops a spin - peierls state at low temperatures.@xcite the spin - peierls state is now well established by the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath3 ) , that is zero below the phase transition at @xmath4 k , the observation by nmr of two independent ti atoms below @xmath5 , the two - fold crystallographic superstructure below @xmath5 and electronic band - structure calculations.@xcite the atomic displacements in the superstructure as well as the calculated band structure , with the single valence electron of ti@xmath6 occupying the @xmath7 orbital , indicate that the spin - peierls state is formed on the chains of ti atoms parallel to @xmath8 via direct exchange interactions .",
    "@xcite    although the properties of the low - temperature phase of tiocl are those of a true spin - peierls system , tiocl is not a conventional spin - peierls compound , because the phase transition at @xmath5 is first - order .",
    "the temperature dependencies of @xmath3 , electron spin resonance ( esr ) , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , specific heat ( @xmath9 ) and x - ray diffraction have shown that a second - order phase transition occurs at @xmath10 k. @xcite the 1d character of the magnetic interactions was also supported by the temperature dependencies of optical reflectivity and angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) , @xcite although it was suggested that on cooling from room temperature , a crossover from two - dimensional ( 2d ) towards 1d interactions occurs.@xcite the nature of the state above @xmath5 is not understood yet .",

    ".    incited by the observation , that some reflections were broader than others in the @xmath44-scans of the data collection ( see below ) , the possibility of a second incommensurate component of the modulation was investigated , then resulting in a modulation wavevector @xmath49 .",

    "two possibilities exist for the superspace group .",

    "the incommensurate modulation is described by one harmonic for each of the two waves ( eq . [ e - ortho_qvectors ] ) . because all atoms are in the mirror plane @xmath64 , the two harmonics are equivalent by symmetry and three of the six independent components are zero .",

    "the two models share several features , that allow for conclusions on the state of the intermediate phase .",
    "the major amplitude is the displacement of ti along @xmath8 .",

    "displacements along @xmath70 are small , in accordance with the lt phase , where symmetry requires them to be zero .",

    "@xcite the latter interpretation is in accordance with the observed increase of the two - dimensional character on increasing temperature,@xcite and with the proposed contributions of @xmath90 and @xmath91 symmetries to the orbital of lowest energy and the increased admixture of these orbitals at higher temperatures due to phonons .",
    "@xcite    the two symmetries lead to completely different properties of the phase transition at @xmath5 .",
    "structurally , the orthorhombic model can be considered a precursor to the spin - peierls state , and the phase transition is a lock - in transition .",
    "on the other hand , the monoclinic model requires that the unique axis switches from @xmath71 to @xmath70 at @xmath5 .",
    "accordingly , the domain structure of the material must change , and a much more sluggish behavior of the transition , _",
    "e.g. _ hysteresis , would be expected .",
    "previously , we have failed to observe incommensurate satellites in the intermediate - temperature phase of tiocl .",
    "this is easily explained by the experimental method , that involved scans along reciprocal lattice directions , and thus might have missed possible satellites , especially if the incommensurate components in tiocl will be larger than in tiobr .",
