    "in this paper we focus our attention on a certain class of logics whose expressive power is greater than that of first - order logic ( denoted here by @xmath2 ) , the central logic in mathematics .",
    "while @xmath2 has well - developed model theory due to its many convenient properties , it has a downside in that its expressive power is rather limited .",
    "many natural mathematical statements , for example `` there are infinitely many '' , can not be expressed in @xmath2 .",
    "this motivates study of alternative logics .",
    "mostowski was one of the first to suggest in @xcite the idea of expanding @xmath2 with formulas of the form @xmath3 which are interpreted so that @xmath4 if and only if there are at least @xmath5 elements @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "this idea broadened the notion of quantifier giving rise to many interesting logics defined in a similar way .",
    "the current definition of generalized quantifier is due to lindstrm @xcite .",
    "we describe it in more detail in section [ prel ] .    in short",
    ", every generalized quantifier @xmath8 corresponds to some property of structures that we denote by @xmath9 .",
    "suppose @xmath10 is a logic closed under substitution and @xmath11 is a property not expressible in it . by adding quantifier @xmath12 to @xmath10 we get the smallest extension of @xmath10 satisfying certain closure conditions that can express @xmath11 .",
    "the properties of the new logic @xmath13 can differ substantially from those of @xmath10 and may thus become an interesting object of study .",
    "a justification for studying generalized quantifiers comes among others from the fact that any reasonable extension @xmath10 of , say , the logic @xmath2 , closed under substitutions , is equivalent to the logic @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a class of quantifiers corresponding to some new properties definable in @xmath10 .    in the present work",
    "we shall concentrate on extensions of logics @xmath2 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( the finite variable logic ) with generalized quantifiers @xmath8 that satisfy the following restriction : for all structures @xmath18 $ ] , if @xmath19 and @xmath20 is embeddable into @xmath21 then @xmath22 .",
    "we call such quantifiers _ embedding - closed _ and denote the class of all embedding - closed quantifiers by @xmath1 .",
    "this is an interesting class of quantifiers to study since many well - known quantifiers and properties , like cardinality quantifiers @xmath23 for instance , are closed under embeddings either upwards or downwards which is essentially the same for our purposes .",
    "we present more examples of such properties in section [ emb - cl_quant ] .",
    "we also note that embedding - closed quantifiers are natural in the sense that if @xmath8 is embedding - closed then a sentence @xmath24 says that formulas @xmath25 , @xmath26 , define a structure that have a substructure belonging to a given class of structures .",
    "thus , embedding - closed quantifiers seem to be an interesting object of study , and our observations in this paper show that it is possible to develop general theory for this class of quantifiers .    call a structure @xmath20",
    "_ quasi - homogeneous _ if every isomorphism between finitely generated substructures of @xmath20 can be extended to an embedding of @xmath20 into itself .",
    "this weakens the usual notion of homogeneity which deals with automorphisms instead of embeddings .",
    "the notion of embedding - closed quantifier arises naturally when we observe in theorem [ homog ] that in order to guarantee that a quasi - homogeneous structure has quantifier elimination for logic @xmath27 extended with a set of quantifiers @xmath15 , the quantifiers in @xmath15 must be closed under embeddings .",
    "in @xcite , dawar and grdel showed that @xmath17 augmented with finitely many embedding - closed quantifiers of finite width has a @xmath28-@xmath29 law meaning that on finite structures such a logic can only express properties that hold in almost all finite structures .",
    "our aim is to study further limits of the expressive power of logics with embedding - closed quantifiers that are not implied by a @xmath28-@xmath29 law .",
    "these include for example indefinability of properties of infinite structures and structures with function symbols . in this article we provide two methods that make it possible .",
    "the first method involves construction of a certain chain of quasi - homogeneous structures .",
    "the second method is based on the ehrenfeucht - frass game that we develop in order to characterize @xmath0-equivalence between structures . in the article",
    "we apply these methods to produce a number of undefinability results .",
    "the article is structured as follows . in section [ prel ]",
    "we introduce preliminary notions . in section [ emb - cl_quant ]",
    "we describe basic properties of embedding - closed quantifiers that will be needed later , and give some examples . before moving to our own major results , we show that @xmath30 , where @xmath15 is a finite set of embedding - closed quantifiers of finite width , has a @xmath28-@xmath29 law .",
    "we do this in section [ law ] .",
    "the proof concerning @xmath28-@xmath29 law was originally given in @xcite . in section [ chain_section ]",
    "we introduce the notion of quasi - homogeneity and show that if a chain of quasi - homogeneous structures is sufficiently long then the truth value of a given sentence of a logic with embedding - closed quantifiers is eventually preserved .",
    "this in turn allows us to obtain some undefinability results .",
    "the section has two subsections , one of which is devoted to the undefinability of properties of finite structures and another deals with infinite structures . in section [ game_section ]",
    "we describe the _ embedding game _ that characterizes @xmath31-equivalence of a given pair of structures .",
    "we close the section with an application of the game that allows us to show that for each @xmath32 there is a first - order sentence of quantifier rank @xmath33 that is not expressible by any sentence of @xmath31 of quantifier rank @xmath34 .",
