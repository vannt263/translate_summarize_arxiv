    "young protostars grow in mass mainly by accreting material from their surrounding discs .",
    "the accretion is speculated to be episodic @xcite , as e.g. in fu ori - type outbursts in which a large fraction of the star s mass is delivered within a few hundred years @xcite .",
    "the estimated accretion rates during these bursts are up to @xmath0 , so each burst can deliver a few @xmath1 onto the protostar .",
    "further evidence for episodic accretion comes from the periodically spaced knots seen in bipolar jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "bipolar jets are driven off along the protostellar rotation axis by the energy released as material spirals in and accretes onto the protostar ; periodically spaced knots therefore imply episodic accretion .",
    "finally , the luminosity problem provides indirect observational support for episodic accretion . by the end of the class 0 phase ( @xmath2 yr ) , half the protostar s final mass has been accumulated .",
    "thus for a final mass of @xmath3 , the mean accretion rate onto the protostar must be @xmath4 , and the mean accretion luminosity must be @xmath5 .",
    "this is much larger than the observed bolometric luminosities of typical solar - type protostars @xcite .",
    "episodic accretion mitigates this problem , as the luminosity is only large intermittently , and most protostars are observed between bursts @xcite .",
    "accretion of material onto a young protostar results in large amounts of accretion luminosity which may effect the evolution of the protostar s surrounding disc @xcite .",
    "this is particularly important for the low - mass end of the imf ( e.g. for low - mass stars and brown dwarfs ) as gravitational fragmentation of massive extended discs is considered to be one of the main ways of producing these objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "thus , in order to determine the full effect of radiative feedback in low - mass star formation , it is important to describe in detail the role of episodic accretion .",
    "material spirals from the outer disc region towards the young protostar due to the work of the gravitational instabilities in transporting angular momentum outwards in the disc .",
    "once this material reaches within a few au from the protostar the gis becomes ineffective as the disc is hotter there .",
    "the material is then deposited on a notional inner accretion disc ( iad ) , where it piles up until it becomes hot enough that thermal ionisation couples the matter to the magnetic field . at this point the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) is activated , transporting angular momentum outwards , and thereby allowing the matter accumulated in the iad to spiral inwards and onto the central protostar .",
    "simulations of self - gravitating hydrodynamics on the scale of molecular cloud cores ( i.e. sizes from @xmath6 to @xmath7 and masses from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ) can achieve sufficient resolution to capture the formation of discs around young protostars , and the effects of gis in the outer regions of such discs . however , such simulations can not capture what happens in the inner disc region , where sinks are invoked .",
    "contrary to previous studies , we assume that the matter which enters a sink is not instantly accreted onto to protostar but it is accumulated on the iad , within the sink radius .",
    "we adapt the model of @xcite to phenomenologically describe the properties of episodic accretion .",
    "the details of the model are discussed in @xcite .",
    "an episodic accretion event is initiated when @xmath10 which is presumed to correspond to an iad temperature of @xmath11 . in the above equation @xmath12 is the mass accreted onto the protostar in an outburst event .",
    "the duration of the event is set as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the viscosity parameter provided by the mri . to match observations of fu ori stars ,",
    "we assume an exponential decay of the accretion rate @xmath15    once the accretion rate of the protostar has been determined using the above model , its luminosity at any time is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mass of the protostar , @xmath18 its radius , and @xmath19 is the accretion rate onto it .",
    "the first term on the righthand side is the intrinsic luminosity of the protostar ( due to contraction and nuclear reactions in its interior ) .",
    "the second term is the accretion luminosity .",
    "@xmath20 is the fraction of the accretion energy that is radiated away at the photosphere of the protostar , rather than being expended driving jets and/or winds @xcite .",
    "we assume @xmath21 is the typical radius of a young protostar @xcite . at the initial stages of star formation",
    "the accretion luminosity dominates over the intrinsic luminosity of the protostar .",
    "the above model describes macroscopically the effects of episodic accretion , which in turn regulates the radiative feedback from the protostar .",
    "to evaluate the consequences of episodic accretion for disc fragmentation and low - mass star formation , we perform radiation hydrodynamic simulations of a collapsing turbulent molecular core .",
    "we use the sph code seren @xcite , in which the radiative transfer is treated with the diffusion approximation of @xcite .",
    "the outer envelope of the core extends to @xmath22  au , and the total core mass is 5.4  @xmath23 .",
    "we perform three simulations , all with the same initial conditions , and differing only in their treatments of the luminosities of protostars ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) . in all three simulations",
    "the initial collapse leads to the formation of a primary protostar ( i.e. a first sink ) at @xmath24 kyr , and this quickly acquires an extended accretion disc ( figs .",
