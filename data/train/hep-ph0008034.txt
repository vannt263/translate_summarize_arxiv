    "the study of meson - baryon scattering is one of the most challenging topics of particle physics at low and intermediate energies .",
    "firstly , because there exist accurate experimental data and secondly because it provides an excellent scenario where chiral symmetry breaking ( chsb ) can be tested .",
    "unlike the light pseudo - scalar meson  meson scattering , the role played by chsb in the pseudo - scalar meson  baryon scattering case turns out to be more subtle and the construction of an effective field theory ( eft ) to describe the latter processes becomes more cumbersome . in the light meson ",
    "meson sector the expansion parameter is @xmath6 , being @xmath7 the four - momentum of the goldstone bosons  @xcite and @xmath8 the corresponding meson weak decay constant .",
    "since the baryon mass is already of the order of @xmath9 , such an expansion does not work in practice for the meson ",
    "baryon sector , though some efforts were undertaken  @xcite .",
    "this drawback was overcome by formulating a new consistent derivative expansion for baryons in a chiral effective field theory  @xcite , called heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) .",
    "hbchpt is a reformulation of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) with baryons where the baryon mass is shifted from the propagator to the interaction couplings of the eft   @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) physics  @xcite . ] . in this way",
    "higher orders are suppressed either by powers of @xmath6 or by powers of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the baryon mass and @xmath14 is either the light pseudo - scalar meson mass or the off - shellness of the baryon , respectively .",
    "recently , a fully relativistic formulation consistent with the power counting proposed in hbchpt has been proposed  @xcite , but there is so far a lack of practical applications .",
    "standard hbchpt has been applied to the @xmath4 system several times already in subsequently higher orders  @xcite and successful fits in the close to threshold region have been found . on the other hand hbchpt , as it is also the case for chpt in the meson sector , is unable to describe resonances , which clearly indicate the appearance of non - perturbative chiral dynamics .",
    "resonances , play a crucial role in meson - baryon systems . for instance , the low and intermediate energy @xmath4 scattering is mostly dominated by the @xmath15 resonance , since it is close to threshold and its coupling to pions and nucleons turns out to be quite strong  @xcite .",
    "hence , the @xmath5 degrees of freedom are often explicitly incorporated in any effective approach aiming at describing low and intermediate energy pion - nucleon dynamics to some degree of accuracy  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "exact unitarity plays a crucial role in the description of resonances , since at the corresponding energy the scattering amplitude takes its maximum possible value .",
    "hbchpt only restores unitarity perturbatively and hence even the computation of phase - shifts becomes ambiguous beyond perturbation theory . actually , in previous works the unitarization program of hbchpt for the lowest @xmath16 and @xmath17 partial wave amplitudes obtained in has already been studied up to third order in the chiral expansion , by using the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) either in its most straightforward version  @xcite or within an improved iam  @xcite .",
    "we note here that since the unitarity correction takes first place at nnlo in hbchpt one needs to go to that order in order to unitarize  la iam .",
    "the aim of the present work is to show how a unitarization framework based on the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse )  @xcite and hbchpt to lowest order yields to a very simple expression for the scattering amplitude which preserves unitarity and provides a satisfactory description of @xmath4 elastic scattering data .",
    "our work can be regarded as a natural extension of the approach previously proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite for @xmath18 scattering to the physics of the @xmath4 system .",
    "we have concentrated our attention into the @xmath0 ( @xmath19 ) channel , and show that the existence of the @xmath5 resonance can be understood in terms of the @xmath4 interactions constrained to hbchpt .",
    "hence there is no particular need to include the @xmath5-degrees of freedom explicitly in order to provide a successful description of the experimentally observed phase - shifts .",
    "the extension to other partial waves as well as higher order contributions in hbchpt will be analyzed and presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the bse for the elastic @xmath4 scattering amplitude ( @xmath21 ) in a given isospin channel , @xmath22 , reads    to    @xmath23    with @xmath24 where the kinematical variables are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : kin ] and @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath16 are the two particle irreducible amputated green function , pion and nucleon propagators respectively .",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are matrices and a spinor  . ] in the nucleon dirac space and finally , @xmath30 are nucleon spin indices ( helicity , covariant spin , etc ... ) .",
    "the normalization of the amplitude @xmath21 is determined by its relation with the center or mass ( cm ) differential cross section , in the isospin channel @xmath22 , and it is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "rotational , parity and time reversal invariances ensures for the on shell particles @xmath33 with @xmath34 the cm angle between the initial and final pion three momentum and @xmath35 a unit three - vector orthogonal to @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "partial waves , @xmath38 , are related to @xmath39 by @xmath40 p_l(\\cos\\theta ) \\nonumber\\\\ { \\cal b}^i(s,\\theta ) & = & -\\sum_l \\left [   f_{il}^{l+\\frac12}(s ) -    \\,\\,f_{il}^{l-\\frac12}(s ) \\right ] \\frac{d p_l(\\cos\\theta)}{d\\theta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the phase of the amplitude @xmath21 is such that the relation between the partial wave amplitudes and phase - shifts is the usual one , @xmath41 .",
    "hence , on - shell unitarity implies for @xmath42 @xmath43^{-1 } = -   |\\,\\vec{q}\\,|_{cm } = - \\frac{\\lambda^\\frac12(s , m^2,m^2)}{2\\sqrt s } \\label{eq : uni_f}\\ ] ] with @xmath44 mev , @xmath45 mev , the nucleon and pion masses respectively , and @xmath46 .",
    "note that , to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs ] ) both the off - shell _ potential _ and amplitude are required .",
    "clearly , for the exact _ potential _ @xmath25 and propagators @xmath26 and @xmath16 , the bse provides an exact solution of the scattering amplitude @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "obviously an exact solution for @xmath21 is not accessible , since @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath16 are not exactly known .",
    "we propose an expansion along the lines of hbchpt both for the exact _ potential _",
    "( @xmath25 ) and the exact propagators .    the lowest order of the hbchpt expansion in the @xmath0 channel leads to  @xcite @xmath47 where the velocity @xmath48 is a time - like unit four - vector , in terms of which the nucleon momenta can be written as @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "the eft can be written in terms of nucleon fields @xmath51 with a definite velocity @xmath52 which are related to the original nucleon fields @xmath53 by @xmath54 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath55 is defined in terms of the velocity and the dirac matrices = { \\rm i}\\ , \\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\alpha}v^\\rho s^\\alpha\\ ] ] with @xmath56 . ] .",
    "finally , @xmath57 mev and @xmath58 are the pion weak decay constant and the vector axial coupling , respectively .",
    "note that because of isospin conservation , the direct born term does not contribute to the @xmath59 _",
    "potential_. likewise due to angular momentum conservation the contact term does not contribute either to the @xmath0 @xmath20 scattering and we will ignore it from now on .",
    "thus at lowest order , the bse ( eq .  ( [ eq : bs ] ) ) for the @xmath0 channel reads : @xmath60 we look for solutions to the above equation , suggested by a one - loop calculation , of the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 are functions of two variables to be determined .",
    "note that , as a simple one loop calculation shows , there appears a new dependence ( @xmath63 ) not present in the lowest order _ potential _ @xmath64 .",
    "that is similar to what happens in standard hbchpt  @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : bs_hb ] ) determines the functions @xmath62 , which turn out to satisfy the following integral equations @xmath65 the above set of linearly coupled integral equations needs to be regularized , solved and renormalized .",
    "this program is highly non - trivial , and hence to draw solutions to these equations we will make use of the analytical structure of the involved functions .",
    "for on - shell scattering and at leading order in the @xmath66 expansion , implicit in hbchpt formalism , lab and cm systems coincide .",
    "then , choosing @xmath67 and taking into account that in the infinitely heavy nucleon limit @xmath68 , the pion energy , we find @xmath69 where @xmath70 for on - shell scattering .",
    "the function @xmath71 enters in the @xmath72 pion - nucleon scattering amplitude , and we will discuss it elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "elastic unitarity , eq .",
    "( [ eq : uni_f ] ) , applied to the function @xmath73 requires for @xmath74 @xmath75 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : a - off ] ) , the on - shell function @xmath73 satisfies , for @xmath74 , @xmath76    to    the function @xmath73 above develops an imaginary part from two difference sources : the elastic channel and the inelastic channel corresponding to @xmath77 process , as can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig : cross - cuts ] ) . to obtain , eq .",
    "( [ eq : uni ] ) we have completely neglected all possible in - elasticities .",
    "we are going to proof that the solution of the eq .",
    "( [ eq : a - on ] ) automatically satisfies the elastic unitarity condition , given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : uni ] ) , provided the pion energy , @xmath78 , is such that we are below the two pion threshold or , equivalently , if the latter contribution to @xmath79 is neglected .",
    "this can be easily seen by standard operator methods by writing eq .",
    "( [ eq : a - off ] ) in an operator form @xmath80 with an obvious identification of the kernel @xmath81 and @xmath82 given by @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "if the inelastic @xmath77 channel is not considered , the potential @xmath85 can be considered to be real , so that the corresponding i@xmath86 can be ignored .",
    "thus , one gets @xmath87 by direct application of cutkosky s rules , we get from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pro ] ) @xmath88 ( -2{\\rm i}\\pi)^2\\delta^+(k^2-m^2)\\ , \\delta(\\alpha - v\\cdot k)\\ , \\delta ( \\nu - v\\cdot k ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac16 ( m^2 - \\alpha^2 ) \\delta ( \\alpha -\\nu ) 2{\\rm i } { \\rm i m }   j_0(\\alpha)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 and the one - loop function @xmath90 has been defined .",
    "it is linearly divergent and hence two subtractions are needed to make it convergent  @xcite , @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are related to the divergent constants @xmath94 and @xmath95 . finally , in the infinite nucleon mass limit , @xmath96 , and eq.([eq : uni -",
    "a ] ) reduces to the unitarity condition of eq.([eq : uni ] ) .",
    "an exact solution of the bse ( [ eq : a - on ] ) contains both elastic and two pion inelastic contributions , even though eq .",
    "( [ eq : a - on ] ) constitutes a lowest order approximation .",
    "this feature makes a practical solution of that equation very difficult , mainly due to the non - locality in the momentum variable of the exchanged nucleon . on the other hand",
    ", we have seen that the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : a - on ] ) exactly satisfies the unitarity condition of eq.([eq : uni ] ) when in - elasticities are neglected . besides , the inelastic contributions start at @xmath97 , but they are not complete because terms of the same order have not even been included in the iterated _ potential _ and _ propagator _ ( vertex correction and self - energy insertion ) .",
    "thus , we propose to solve the bse ( [ eq : a - on ] ) in the limit in which the inelastic @xmath77 channel does not contribute to the imaginary part of @xmath73 , although this channel may contribute to the real part of @xmath73 as a subthreshold effect .",
    "to do that , we make use of the analytical structure of @xmath98 in the complex @xmath78 plane implied by the bse to the lowest order considered .",
    "once that the two pion channel contribution to @xmath79 is neglected , @xmath98 only has a right hand cut , with branch points in @xmath99 and infinity , and a discontinuity through the cut determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : uni ] ) , @xmath100 on the other hand @xmath98 is not expected to have poles which would correspond to zeros has been factorized out ] of @xmath73 and thus of the cross section . under these circumstances and as demanded by the asymtotic behaviour deduced from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dis ] ) , , a four - times subtracted dispersion relation for @xmath98 is needed , which then reads and @xmath101 have the same analytical structure , and therefore they can only differ by a polynomial in @xmath78 . ] for @xmath74 : @xmath102 the coefficients @xmath103 might be expanded in powers of @xmath104 . in the former equation",
    "we have explicitly separated the lowest born term ( @xmath105 ) which only affects to the linear coefficient in @xmath78 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath106 in the infinite nucleon mass limit .",
    "we would like to make a few remarks :    * the structure of the solution , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ainv ] ) , of eq .",
    "( [ eq : a - on ] ) , agrees with the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that in the case of chpt in the meson - meson sector , to get the on - shell amplitude , the off - shellness of the bse could be ignored , as long as a renormalized _ potential _ is iterated . with this philosophy in mind ,",
    "( [ eq : a - on ] ) becomes @xmath107 the divergent integral @xmath108 is related to @xmath109 , @xmath110 , with @xmath111 a polynomial in the variable @xmath78 of degree one .",
    "the above equation , is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ainv ] ) .",
    "note , that in this approximation , the nucleon propagator which enters in the iterated _ potential _ , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_cross ] ) , has been taken out of the integral and hence it can never be put on the mass - shell .",
    "this is the reason why the approximate solution given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ainv - tes ] ) does not contain the inelastic channel @xmath112 contribution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cross - cuts ] ) and thus it can coincide with the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ainv ] ) , based only on the elastic unitarity requirement . *",
    "if one is going to neglect explicitly the inelastic channel , then only the nucleon propagator @xmath113 contributes to the elastic cut .",
    "this suggests to make a taylor expansion around @xmath78 in the integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq : a - on ] ) , it is to say @xmath114 the leading order of this expansion yields again to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ainv ] ) .",
    "to prove the usefulness of our main result , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ainv ] ) , we perform a direct @xmath115 fit to the experimental phase shift in the @xmath0 channel  @xcite from threshold up to @xmath1161500 mev .",
    "we have assigned a 3% uncertainty to the phase shift as in  @xcite plus a systematic error of one degree to the data ( similar treatments are followed in  @xcite and  @xcite ) .    the @xmath115 fit yields the following numerical values for the parameters : @xmath117 with @xmath118 .",
    "the description of the data from threshold to the region well above the resonance is pretty good as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ] ( upper solid line ) .    on the other hand",

    "they depend only on @xmath123 , @xmath124 and the low energy constants ( lecs):@xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite . the right hand side in eq .",

    "( [ eq : ainv ] ) which ensures exact elastic unitarity , allows for a satisfactory fit to data , as long as the contributions coming from two pion production are small and the left - hand - cut contribution can be modeled , in the scattering region , by a polynomial of the third degree in the variable @xmath131 .    in the extreme static approximation ,",
    "the hbchpt estimate of the polynomial @xmath132 provides the bulk of the resonant shape , although it is far from describing accurately the data .",
    "similar conclusions , within the iam scheme , were reached in ref .",
    "there also , it was shown that the @xmath133 corrections ( nlo in the chiral expansion ) are extremely important .",
    "this might explain the big discrepancies between the set of parameters of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : res ] ) and  ( [ eq : cesth ] ) . results in eq .",

    "we have used hbchpt as a perturbative guide to implement in a sensible way the constraints imposed by chiral symmetry .",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation provides , in addition , a workable scheme where unitarity is exactly restored up to the level imposed by the corresponding kernel and , moreover , allows for an identification of the infinite set of diagrams being summed up . in the case of @xmath4 scattering in the @xmath0 channel",
    "we have used hbchpt to lowest order as input .",
    "the bse is able , out of its divergence structure , to generate some of the higher order counter - terms required in standard hbchpt in the form of subtraction constants for the divergent integrals .",
    "actually , our bse amplitude admits a very good fit to the experimental phase shifts in terms of four subtraction constants .",
    "nevertheless , their fitted values differ , at least within estimated errors , from those deduced from hbchpt .",
    "the discrepancy may be understood because the nlo ( @xmath133 ) contributions are comparable to the lo ( @xmath104 ) ones , and hence the matching procedure of the bse solution to standard hbchpt amplitudes induces large numerical corrections .",
    "this situation is not new and was already encountered in previous studies based on the iam  @xcite which require a similar matching procedure of unitarized amplitudes to the standard ones of hbchpt . as we see",
    ", however , the amount of work required to describe the @xmath134 scattering data within the bse , and in particular , the @xmath1 resonance is drastically smaller than that needed for the iam .",
    "in addition , as we pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite for the meson - meson problem , one can search for systematic improvement and convergence in a bse framework .",
