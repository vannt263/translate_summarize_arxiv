    "among the extremely remarkable properties of the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect  @xcite a major role is played by the emergence of anyonic excitations carrying fractional charge and statistics  @xcite . in particular , quasiparticle ( qp ) excitations for states belonging to the laughlin @xcite and jain sequence  @xcite are predicted to have abelian exchange statistics .",
    "more intriguingly , some of the proposed models for the filling factor @xmath0  @xcite predict the emergence of excitations with charge @xmath1 , and multiples , with possible non - abelian properties  @xcite .",
    "these predictions paved the way to possible applications of non - abelian anyons in fault - tolerant topological quantum computation ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "unfortunately , as far as we know , a direct confirmation of fractional statistics is still lacking even if different proposal are reported in the literature  @xcite .",
    "so far , evidence of the fractional statistics is indirect , essentially based on the evidence of the existence of fractional charges  @xcite .",
    "a great experimental effort has been devoted in the last years to access fractional charges through shot noise measurements in quantum point contact ( qpc ) geometry starting with the seminal works of refs .",
    "@xcite . in this direction ,",
    "composite states ( for example @xmath2 ) showed a quite universal phenomenology leading to a crossover between two different value of the effective charge as a function of temperature or bias  @xcite .",
    "this behaviour has been explained in terms of competition of two charge carriers : the agglomerates and the single - qp  @xcite .",
    "similar arguments hold as well for the state at @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "other interpretations based on edge state reconstruction @xcite , local filling factor effects  @xcite or tunnelling amplitude non - linearities  @xcite have also been proposed .",
    "unfortunately , in the discussed measurements , the contributions associated to the various excitations are typically mixed because these studies are conducted at very low frequencies ( almost dc ) .",
    "therefore , it is useful to find alternative methods to address the excitations separately .    a possible way is to consider the noise at finite frequency ( f.f . )",
    "indeed , this quantity presents resonant singular behaviour ( such as peaks or dips ) in correspondence of the josephson frequency @xmath3 associated to each charge carrier @xmath4 with @xmath5 the applied bias .",
    "this is an independent method to measure the charge of the fractional excitations in the system that has not yet be experimentally explored for fqh states so far .",
    "indeed , for sufficiently low temperatures @xmath6 , it allows to separate the different charge contributions realising a sort of qp spectroscopy .",
    "intriguingly enough , f.f .",
    "noise could efficiently address also other properties , like the scaling dimensions associated to each qp excitation using only a bias scan at fixed frequency as we will show .",
    "this combination of information has the potential to give further constraints on the edge state model  @xcite , and finally to address the topological order of the bulk ground state  @xcite .",
    "first theoretical steps in this direction were done on symmetrised noise  @xcite , typical quantity considered at low frequencies . in such case the expected features associated to the state at @xmath0  @xcite as well as the possibility to access the contribution associated to the different qps predicted by theoretical models  @xcite have been investigated . however , at high frequencies @xmath7 , quantum effects become relevant and the symmetrised f.f .",
    "noise is only one possible choice among different experimental quantities addressed by different protocols . indeed , in such regime , one has to identify the relevant quantity measured with the specific setup under investigation @xcite .",
    "hereafter we get inspiration by the proposal of lesovik and loosen  @xcite where a model based on a resonant lc circuit is discussed in order to extract non - symmetrised current - current correlations .",
    "recent experiments carried out for a two dimensional electron gas qpc in absence of magnetic field fully agree with theoretical predictions  @xcite . since the resonant circuit coupled to a qpc is the prototypical measurement scheme in fqh experiments  @xcite it appears quite obvious to explore the same physics in this contest .",
    "we have recently investigated the same setup for an abelian fqh states  @xcite , and here we consider it to the case @xmath0 analysing the signatures of the different non - abelian phases ( pfaffian and anti - pfaffian ) . the goal of the present paper is to analyse in details the expected f.f . measured noise for a realistic situation .",
    "the effects associated to the temperature of the fqh qpc system and the lc detector on the visibility are also carefully considered .",
    "the paper is divided as follows : in section 2 we discuss the non - abelian models for edge states pointing out similarities and differences in term of the most dominant fractionally charged excitations . in section 3",
    "we discuss the definition of the noise properties for a qpc in the weak - backscattering regime and the definition of the noise power measured in the proposed setup . in section 4",
    "we discuss the result for the measured noise power obtained for two considered non - abelian models and we also compare them with the well know symmetrised noise . finally we inspect the effect of changing the detector temperature @xmath8 .",
    "we start recalling the two more accredited models of composite edge states at filling factor @xmath0  @xcite : the pfaffian ( p )  @xcite and the disorder dominated anti - pfaffian ( ap )  @xcite .",

    "moreover one may reasonably assume a larger charge velocity @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "the quantization of the above bosonic fields is given by the commutation relation = i_c / n sgn(x - y ) , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 , while the majorana fermion commutes with both .",

    "this statement can be easily verified by looking at both the left and right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "finally , in order to find a signature of the charged excitations without identifying their scaling dimension , we could vary the lc detector temperature @xmath8 in order to increase the sensibility for charge detection  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show that this approach works for both the two non - abelian edge models .",
    "increasing @xmath8 increases the height of the jump in @xmath98 ( top panels ) which correspond also to an increase of the height of the peak in the derivatives ( bottom ) .",
    "note that since the coupling with the detector is assumed weak ( no poisoning from the detector ) the width of the peaks is only slightly influenced by the detector temperature , preserving the resolving power of the discussed bias spectroscopy .",
    "then the crucial limiting factor to the bias spectroscopy is the qpc temperature @xmath59 .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the power to distinguish between the ap and p model is not essentially compromised by the detector temperature since all the feature characterising the model in terms of @xmath98 seems mutually amplified .",
    "increasing @xmath8 is an interesting resource in order to increase detection efficiency , in this perspective .",
    "we have investigated the behaviour of f.f . emitted power @xmath98 of a resonant lc circuit weakly coupled to a qpc built in a quantum hall bar at filling factor @xmath0 .",
    "we showed that the emitted power is represented in terms of the non - symmetrised noise components of the quantum hall qpc weighted by the bosonic distribution of the resonant lc circuit .",
    "we have inspected the different predictions of the pfaffian and anti - pfaffian non - abelian edge states models for this quantity .",
    "we showed that this setup can detect and discriminate between the dominant and sub - dominant fractionally charged excitations looking at the bias dependence at fixed ghz frequencies .",
    "we also discussed the advantage to use this measurement protocol in comparison to the f.f .",
    "symmetrised noise .",
    "finally we demonstrated how the sensibility of the proposed setup can be increased varying the lc detector temperature @xmath8 .",
