    "as known , two nucleons can be ejected from the nucleus by two - body currents due to meson exchanges and delta - isobar excitation . but also , the real or virtual photon can hit , through a one - body current either nucleon of a correlated pair and both nucleons",
    "are then ejected simultaneously from the nucleus .",
    "the role and relevance of these two competing processes can be different in different reactions and kinematics .",
    "it is thus possible to envisage situations where either process is dominant and various specific effects can be disentangled and separately investigated .",
    "this gives ground for studies of short - range correlations ( src ) @xcite in a nucleus by means of the two - nucleon knockout processes .",
    "various theoretical models for cross section calculations have been developed in recent years in order to explore the effects of ground - state @xmath5 correlations on @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath7 @xcite knockout reactions .",
    "it appears from these studies that the most promising tool for investigating src in nuclei is represented by the @xmath8 reaction , where the effect of the two - body currents is less dominant as compared to the @xmath9 and @xmath7 processes .",
    "measurements of the exclusive @xmath0o@xmath10c reaction performed at nikhef in amsterdam @xcite and mami in mainz  @xcite have confirmed , in comparison with the theoretical results , the validity of the direct knockout mechanism for transitions to low - lying states of the residual nucleus and have given clear evidence of src for the transition to the ground state of @xmath11c .",
    "one of the main ingredients in the transition matrix elements of exclusive two - nucleon knockout reactions is the two - nucleon overlap function ( tof ) .",
    "the tof contains information on nuclear structure and correlations and allows one to write the cross section in terms of the two - hole spectral function @xcite .",
    "the tof s and their properties are widely reviewed , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the tof s for the @xmath0o@xmath10c reaction are given by the product of a coupled and fully antisymmetrized pair function of the shell model and a jastrow - type correlation function which incorporates src .",
    "a more sophisticated treatment is used in @xcite , where the tof s are obtained from an explicit calculation of the two - proton spectral function of @xmath0o @xcite , which includes , with some approximations but consistently , both src and long - range correlations ( lrc ) .    a different method to calculate the tof s has been suggested in @xcite using the established general relationships connecting tof s with the ground state two - body density matrix ( tdm ) .",
    "the procedure is based on the asymptotic properties of the tof s in coordinate space , when the distance between two of the particles and the center of mass of the remaining core becomes very large .",
    "this procedure can be considered as an extension of the method suggested in @xcite , where the relationship between the one - body density matrix and the one - nucleon overlap function is established .",
    "the latter has been applied @xcite to calculate the one - nucleon overlap functions , spectroscopic factors and to make consistent calculations of the cross sections of different one - nucleon removal reactions , such as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 @xcite on @xmath0o @xcite and @xmath15ca @xcite , @xmath12 on @xmath16 mg , @xmath17si and @xmath18s @xcite , as well as @xmath19 on @xmath18s @xcite within various correlation methods .",
    "the first aim of the present work is to apply the procedure suggested in @xcite to calculate tof s for @xmath0o using the tdm calculated in @xcite with the jastrow correlation method ( jcm ) , which incorporates the nucleon - nucleon src . as a second aim ,",
    "the resulting two - proton overlap functions are used to calculate the cross section of the @xmath0o@xmath8 reaction for the transition to the @xmath20 ground and the @xmath21 excited states of @xmath11c .",
    "the cross sections are calculated on the basis of the theoretical approach developed in @xcite .",
    "in this section we present shortly the definitions and some properties of the tdm and related quantities in the overlap function representation . the method to extract the tof s from the tdm @xcite used in this work",
    "is also given .",
    "the tdm is defined in coordinate space as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the antisymmetric @xmath24-fermion ground state wave function normalized to unity and @xmath25 , @xmath26 are creation and annihilation operators at position @xmath27 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath27 includes the spatial coordinate @xmath28 and spin and isospin variables .",
    "the tdm @xmath29 is trace - normalized to the number of pairs of particles : @xmath30    of direct physical interest is the decomposition of the tdm in terms of the overlap functions between the @xmath24-particle ground state and the eigenstates of the @xmath31-particle systems , since tof s can be probed in exclusive knockout reactions .    the tof s are defined as the overlap between the ground state of the target nucleus @xmath32 and a specific state @xmath33 of the residual nucleus ( @xmath34 ) @xcite : @xmath35    inserting a complete set of @xmath31 eigenstates @xmath36 into eq .",
    "( [ tdm ] ) one gets @xmath37    the norm of the two - body overlap functions defines the spectroscopic factor @xmath38    a procedure for obtaining the tof s on the basis of the tdm suggested in @xcite uses the particular asymptotic properties of the tof s .    in the case when two like nucleons ( neutrons or protons ) unbound to the rest of the system are simultaneously transferred , the following hyperspherical type of asymptotics is valid for the two - body overlap functions @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the magnitudes of the relative and center - of - mass ( c.m . ) coordinates , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , @xmath44 is the nucleon mass and @xmath45 is the two - nucleon separation energy .    for a target nucleus with @xmath46 and for large @xmath47 and @xmath48 a single term with @xmath49 ( corresponding to the smallest two - nucleon separation energy ) of the radial part of the tof @xmath50 can be expressed in terms of the tdm as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is constrained by the experimental values of the two - nucleon separation energy @xmath53 .",

    "the coefficient @xmath55 and the constant @xmath56 can be determined from the asymptotics of @xmath57 .",
    "the procedure described briefly in section 2 has been applied to calculate the two - proton overlap functions in the @xmath0o nucleus for the transition to the @xmath20 ground and the @xmath21 excited states of @xmath11c .",

    "the result can be written in the form ( for the smallest value of @xmath63 ) : @xmath64 where the bar denotes the integration over the angles and summation over the spin variables , and @xmath65 is the radial part of the total tof obtained after the integration and summation . using the asymptotics of @xmath65 at @xmath66 , @xmath67 one can write : @xmath68    the results for the @xmath58 and @xmath59 partial components have a similar behaviour as previous ones , the main difference is that they are somewhat reduced in magnitude .",
    "the spectroscopic factor corresponding to the total tof is equal to unity in the uncorrelated case and 0.965 in the jastrow case .",
    "the jastrow tdm ( including only src ) is not `` rich '' enough to be able to explain realistically transitions to all the excited states of @xmath11c .",
    "therefore , only the transition to the 1@xmath69 state is considered in the present paper as an example of the applicability of the method .    in the case of the transition to the @xmath21 excited state of @xmath11c @xmath4-pairs in the states",

    "the results of the present work can be summarized as follows :    * the two - nucleon overlap functions ( and their norms , the spectroscopic factors ) corresponding to the knockout of two protons from the ground state of @xmath0o and the transition to the ground and @xmath21 excited states of @xmath11c are calculated using the recently established relationship @xcite between the tof s and the tdm . in the calculations the tdm obtained within the jcm @xcite is used .",
