    "the search for signatures of nonperturbative quantum gravity in the history of the early universe has motivated several authors to consider cosmological models inspired by open string field theory ( osft),@xcite the @xmath0-adic string,@xcite or other nonlocal effective actions.@xcite in the first category , the typical starting point is a nonlocal scalar equation with polynomial potential , [ geom ] ( + m^2)+^n=0 , where @xmath1 is the dalembertian operator , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are constants , and @xmath4 .",
    "this type of pseudo - differential operators can be conveniently manipulated with the diffusion equation approach , which was developed and employed , in diverse numerical or analytical guises , in refs .",
    "@xcite . in brief , the method can be outlined as follows:@xcite ( a ) let the scalar field @xmath5 evolve also along an auxiliary direction @xmath6 and interpret @xmath7 as a fixed value of the extra variable .",
    "( b ) find a solution @xmath8 of the _ local _ system ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this is the initial condition for a system that evolves in @xmath6 via the diffusion equation [ difeq ] ( + _ r)=0 .",
    "( c ) the solution of the diffusion equation is [ solde ] ( r , t)=^r(0,t ) . in particular , the effect of the nonlocal operator @xmath10 is a shift of the auxiliary variable @xmath6 : [ q ] ^q(r , t)= ^-q_r ( r , t)=(r - q , t ) .",
    "( d ) if the initial condition is chosen to be constant almost everywhere , the final configuration @xmath11 obtained by diffusion along @xmath6 is a smooth function which solves ( exactly or approximately ) the original nonlocal system for some @xmath7 ( here we do not consider smooth initial conditions@xcite ) .    in a recent paper,@xcite",
    "we found a rolling homogeneous solution to ( [ geom ] ) : [ phi ] = ( , z)= , where @xmath12 and ( , z^2)=2_0^z ^2 - 1 ^-^2 is the lower incomplete gamma function ( see sec .  8.35 of ref .",
    "the constant @xmath13 will determine the shape of the scalar field profile .",
    "first , we derived an approximate scaling formula which expresses powers of the incomplete gamma function as a single @xmath14 with rescaled arguments : [ dupli2 ] [ ( , z)]^n ( n , z ) , where = ( n,).[kappa2 ] when @xmath15 , using the properties of @xmath14 one can show that ( [ phi ] ) approximately ( in the sense of ( [ dupli2 ] ) ) solves ( [ geom ] ) with s=(1-)r , m^2= -,=-m^2 , and the universe expands as a power - law : = -_t^2 -_t .",
    "the solution obeys the diffusion equation ( [ difeq ] ) and the action of the nonlocal operator in ( [ geom ] ) is a rescaling : e^s(,z)=(,z ) .",
    "the level of approximation of the solution ( [ phi ] ) is determined by the duplication formula ( [ dupli2 ] ) and is sufficient to construct easily instantonic tachyon solutions of supersymmetric string field theory on flat minkowski spacetime , @xmath16 . the approximation scheme related with the duplication formula",
    "was extensively discussed in ref .",
    "its domain of validity was studied in the parameter space @xmath17 .",
    "the values taken here lie within this domain .",
    "in this paper we consider the inverse problem of which cosmology one would expect for a given scalar field profile .",
    "this perspective is sometimes used in inflationary or big bang cosmology when one requires a particular profile .",
    "for instance , in several inflationary models the scalar potential is derived from other known variables ( scalar profile @xmath18 and hubble evolution @xmath19 ) by the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equations ; if one is interested in runaway potentials , the inverse problem selects simple @xmath18 s and @xmath19 s from which one can extrapolate the field potential with those characteristics .",
    "a third application of the inverse problem is in the context of ekpyrotic / phantom / braneworld dual models , where a duality between physically inequivalent models is established through the scale factor or hubble parameter . the scalar potential is consequently extracted either from the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equations or directly from quantities of the dual model ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    here",
    ", the main difference with respect to the cases above is that we also extract the hubble parameter from the diffusion equation for a given solution .",
    "the solution is given _ ab initio _ because the incomplete gamma function is the only profile we know which allows one to easily solve the diffusion equation and ( approximately ) the nonlinear scalar equation simultaneously via the duplication formulae of ref .",
    "the diffusion equation determines univocally a family of hubble parameters , while the algebraic and analytic properties of the incomplete gamma fix the scalar equation , and hence the potential .",
    "the potentials we obtain are rather simple , thus further justifying the method _ a posteriori_. the other independent equation of motion ( the friedmann equation ) may not be the one of standard general relativity and one will have to reconstruct it .",
    "however , this is not the focus of this work .",
    "we discuss the dynamics of two cosmological scalar profiles , one with the cubic potential of the bosonic osft tachyon and the other for a toy model with exponential potential . in the former case ,",
    "the tachyon rolls down the minimum driving a superaccelerating expansion .",
    "we assume the scalar field to be the only matter present in the universe and that it sources the cosmological expansion .",
    "in general , the expansion can also be driven by gravity itself , like in higher - derivative theories .",
    "this sector is beyond our scope because we do not solve all of einstein s equations .",
    "although it is not shown whether the solutions thus found have a direct physical application , they are worth recording as they illustrate a methodology for treating nonlocal _ nonlinear _ equations analytically on a curved ( in particular , friedmann  robertson  walker ) background .",
    "such is the first motivation for this work .",
    "moreover , they are explicit realizations of the intuitive idea that the cosmological friction heavily affects nonlocal dynamics .",
    "this is clear for the solution with cubic potential , which can be confronted with its unbounded minkowski analog ( the string tachyon ) : the wild oscillations of the minkowski solution are absent in the cosmological solution because , due to hubble friction , the field reaches the minimum of its potential in the infinite future .",
    "the present work has been conceived as a follow - up of our line of investigation , and as such it is not meant to be self - contained .",
    "we refer to other publications for extensive discussions on issues which may be relevant to nonlocal diffusing theories@xcite and nonlocal cosmological models.@xcite anyway , we wish to ( re)make a cautionary remark .",
    "this class of cosmological models are considered to be toy simplifications of a more complete scenario .",
    "the gravitational sector is not taken into account adequately , since it is basically local ; so , one is actually looking at models where nonlocality has not been retained systematically.@xcite this problem is still unresolved in the literature for this type of nonlocal operators . from the point of view of string",
    "theory , the issue regards the closed string background , for which there is not as much control and consensus as we have for the open string . from the point of view of nonlocal toy models , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite consider a scenario of pure gravity .",
    "inspired by that , one might try to implement the nonperturbative diffusion method also into the gravitational sector .",
    "unfortunately , there is a technical reason why we can not do so , namely , that _ if _ all sectors were dressed with the same nonlocal operators , then the hubble parameter ( friction term in @xmath1 ) would depend on @xmath6 , thus spoiling eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) .",
    "a possible way out is to take different diffusion times @xmath20 for each sector of the theory , but we will leave that for the future .",
    "models , one can reduce these models to local ones of scalar - tensor type.@xcite from that point on , the classical analysis is standard . on the other hand , in our case not only",
    "do we not yet have an _ ansatz _ for the gravity action , but the nonlocality we specialize in does not allow any field redefinition leading to a simple local system ( this point was discussed extensively in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . ]",
    "the case @xmath21 is rather interesting because it corresponds to the tachyon of bosonic string field theory.@xcite for these values , we can estimate the error of approximation by computing [ delt ] _",
    "max_z(z)_z|| , where lhs and rhs are , respectively , the left- and right - hand side of ( [ dupli2 ] ) . the validity of ( [ delt ] ) as a robust assessment of the global error has been discussed and proven in refs .",
    "any solution of the diffusion and scalar equations is easily constrained asymptotically to be such ( see these papers for details ) , so there is no issue about late- or early - time deviations from an exact solution . if they are small , violations of the equations of motion at some intermediate time @xmath22 can be taken into account by adding corrective terms to the solution which vanish asymptotically , but in the present case this is unnecessary because the approximate solution @xmath23 already captures the correct behaviour at all times .",
    "this can be seen by looking at the global error associated with @xmath23 , which is small . plugging in the theoretical value @xmath24 ,",
    "the supremum norm of @xmath25 is @xmath26 .",
    "although this error is already acceptable considering that we have not employed numerical tools , we can improve it by estimating the value of @xmath27 which minimizes the global quantity [ del ] _ , where @xmath28 is sufficient .",
    "we find @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath25 with the theoretical ( thick line ) and numerical ( thin line ) value of @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath21.,width=340 ]    since the metric is singular at @xmath32 , the solution @xmath33 is meaningful only at either negative or positive times .",
    "the equation of motion is -1t+(-^2)=0 .",
    "the static potential @xmath34 has a local minimum at @xmath35 and a local maximum at @xmath36 . since @xmath37 is the potential of the osft tachyon ( at zero truncation level ) on minkowski",
    ", we regard @xmath23 as a solution of the _ riemannian _ problem , i.e. , a problem in euclidean signature on a curved background .",
    "the cosmological equations of motion in euclidean signature are simply those where the usual wick rotation @xmath38 is performed .",
    "this interpretation of the equation of motion is necessary only if one identifies the field @xmath23 with the osft tachyon , because the cubic potential is inverted with respect to the usual definition in the theory .",
    "if one does not wish to do so , then this problem can be considered to be a toy model in minkowski signature .",
    "let @xmath39 .",
    "the hubble parameter is @xmath40 , corresponding to a scale factor @xmath41 .",
    "the riemannian universe expands ( @xmath42 ) in superacceleration ( @xmath43 ) . at @xmath44 ( @xmath45 , big bang )",
    "the field sits on the local maximum and starts rolling down the minimum .",
    "however , it will never reach it , since the cosmological friction grows with time and the universe will expand indefinitely ( @xmath46 ) ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . in the absence of a constant term in the potential , the equation of state evolves from a stiff matter regime ( @xmath47 , where @xmath0 and @xmath48 are , respectively , the pressure and energy density of the scalar field ) to a cosmological constant ( @xmath49 ) .",

    "@xmath50 and @xmath51.,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]    in the corresponding local system i.e. , the one with @xmath3 and @xmath52 fixed while sending @xmath31 to zero , if @xmath23 is solution of the euclidean ( in this case , riemannian ) problem , then @xmath53 is solution to the lorentzian equation of motion .",
    "when nonlocal effects are taken into account , this is true only up to a term @xmath54 , which vanishes in the local limit .",
    "( nonlocal terms of this form were briefly discussed in ref .",
    "qualitatively , the dynamics of the nonlocal lorentzian model with this `` evanescent '' term is the same as the one without it . for @xmath39 ,",
    "@xmath55 rolls down from the local maximum @xmath35 towards the local minimum at @xmath56 , driving superacceleration of an expanding universe .",
    "this behaviour is radically different from the corresponding local picture where the field , like a classical particle subject to friction , oscillates about the euclidean / minkowski ( @xmath57 ) minimum with progressively damped oscillations .",
    "although the system is only mildly nonlocal ( @xmath58 ) , the increasing friction in the nonlocal operator eventually forbids the field to ever reach the minimum .",
    "notably , in the absence of friction the nonlocal lorentzian solution is unbounded , as it undergoes wild oscillations which begin past the minimum.@xcite    the branch @xmath59 corresponds to a contracting universe with scale factor @xmath60 , evolving towards a big crunch singularity . in this case",
    "the scalar field climbs the potential from its local minimum to its local maximum , pulled by antifriction .    since we have not solved the full cosmological inverse problem , we are not able to assess the physical relevance of this model as far the early history of the universe ( inflationary or pre - inflationary ) is concerned",
    ". however , the first two fast - roll parameters are @xmath61 and @xmath62 $ ] , and it would be hard to identify the scalar field as an inflaton generating an almost scale - invariant spectrum . at any rate , this may be regarded as a mathematical example of a bounded osft tachyon solution on a curved background .",
    "with little effort , one can obtain a cosmological nonlocal model with an exponential potential . taking the limit @xmath63 eq .  ( [ geom ] ) for @xmath15 yields [ geome ] ( 0,_0 ^ 2z^2)=^s(0,z^2 ) , where @xmath64 is the upper incomplete gamma function , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is the euler  mascheroni constant . equation ( [ geome ] ) is satisfied with the same accuracy as the previous case;@xcite therefore we refer again to fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
