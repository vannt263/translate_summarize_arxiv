    "the dynamics of phase transformation by nucleation and subsequent growth of a nucleus of a stable phase is a very old problem , which has been studied for more than half a century  @xcite from a fundamental point of view as well as from technological interests .",
    "however , it plays a vital role today , for example , in information technology ( it ) of phase - change optical data storage media .",
    "for example , rewritable ( rw ) compact disks and digital video disks ( dvd ) consist of te based alloys .",
    "the data unit `` bit '' is switched between 0 and 1 by laser heating between the amorphous and the crystalline state  @xcite .",
    "the crystallization occurs through the heterogeneous nucleation at the surface of the disk .",
    "therefore , the data transfer rate of such a phase change storage media depends critically on the time scale of amorphous to crystalline phase transformation by the heterogeneous nucleation  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of phase transformation is usually described by the kolmogorov - johnson - mehl - avrami ( kjma ) kinetics rule  @xcite . according to this rule the fraction of transformed volume follows a straight line in the so - called avrami - plot and the dynamics",
    "is characterized by the slope called the avrami exponent .",
    "the time scale of phase transformation is determined from the _ incubation time _ that is the waiting time before the start of the phase transition , and the _ growth time _ that is the time necessary to accomplish the phase transformation .",
    "the incubation time depends on the transient nucleation rate  @xcite , while the growth time depends both on the steady - state nucleation rate and the growth rate of a nucleus .",
    "theoretically , the validity of the kjma kinetics is well understood  @xcite and tested  @xcite for homogeneous nucleation , but it is not always obvious for heterogeneous nucleation  @xcite .",
    "various modeling and analytical calculations seem to have limited use  @xcite . therefore , theoretical modeling and a computer simulation method that can handle both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation on the same footing are highly desirable .    in the previous paper  @xcite , we adopted the cell dynamics method  @xcite to study kjma kinetics of phase transformation within the framework of time - dependent ginzburg - landau  @xcite or phase field  @xcite model .",
    "the cell dynamics method can successfully describe the classical picture of homogeneous nucleation as well as the interface - limited growth  @xcite of nuclei .",
    "therefore , the whole process of kjma kinetics  @xcite of homogeneous nucleation and growth can be simulated on the same footing using cell dynamics",
    ". then , the time scale of transformation that consists of growth time and incubation time can be studied .",
    "the same story should be effective for heterogeneous nucleation and growth as well .",
    "similar studies of heterogeneous nucleation using the phase field model have appeared very recently  @xcite , but they paid more attention to the early stage of grwoth by spreading .    in this paper , we will use the cell dynamics method with thermal noise to study heterogeneous nucleation and growth under various conditions and settings in the tdgl model in a unified manner . in section",
    "ii we present a short review of the classical picture of nucleation and growth .",

    "the surface field induces heterogeneous nucleation .",
    "section iv is devoted to the results of numerical simulations .",
    "there , we pay attention to the avrami exponent , the incubation time , and the nucleation rate which play dominant roles in the transformation time scale .",
    "finally section v is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "the time evolution of the volume fraction @xmath0 of transformed volume for homogeneous nucleation , for example in two - dimensional infinite system , predicted by kjma ( kolmogorov - johnson - mehl - avrami )  @xcite theory is as follows : @xmath1 which can be generalized as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the so - called avrami exponent , @xmath4 the incubation time , and @xmath5 is the growth time , which is determined from the steady state nucleation rate @xmath6 and the steady state interfacial velocity @xmath7 through @xmath8 then , the double logarithm of ( [ eq:3 - 1 ] ) gives a straight line @xmath9 between @xmath10 and @xmath11 which is the so - called avrami plot .",
    "the slope gives the avrami exponent @xmath3 .    according to the theory of shneidman and weinberg  @xcite ,",
    "if we take into account the time - dependent transient nucleation rate for @xmath6 as well as the size - dependent interfacial velocity for @xmath7 and the finite size of the critical radius @xmath12 of nucleus , the incubation time @xmath4 is given by : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the time lag due to the finite size @xmath12 of the critical nucleus , @xmath15 is the energy barrier to form the critical nucleus and @xmath16 is the absolute temperature    in classical nucleation theory  @xcite , the steady - state homogeneous nucleation rate @xmath6 , that is the number of critical nuclei which appear per unit time and unit volume , is usually given by the activation form @xmath17 where @xmath15 is the nucleation barrier of critical nucleus that appeared in ( [ eq:3 - 4 ] ) .    in order to derive kjma formula ( [ eq:3 - 1 ] )",
    "we have used the following assumption  @xcite :    1 .",
    "the system is infinite and no boundary effect exists .",
    "the nucleation is homogeneous .",
    "therefore , the nuclei form at random sites .",
    "the steady state interfacial velocity @xmath7 is constant or weakly ( power - law ) time - dependence .",
    "4 .   the steady state nucleation rate",
    "@xmath6 is constant or weakly ( power - law ) time - dependent .    in an ideal case when the steady state velocity @xmath7 and the steady state nucleation rate are strictly constant ,",
    "the avrami exponent @xmath3 in ( [ eq:3 - 1 ] ) is given by @xmath18 for @xmath19-dimensional system .",
    "then @xmath20 for @xmath21 dimensional system .",
    "incidentally , when the fixed number of nuclei exist initially and continuous nucleation is suppressed ( no nuclei are added ) , which is called site - saturation case  @xcite , we have @xmath22 therefore , the avrami exponent becomes smaller in the site - saturation case .",
    "the first and the second conditions ( a ) and ( b ) are violated , however , for heterogeneous nucleation .",
    "furthermore , the energy barrier @xmath15 is lowered by the amount  @xcite @xmath23 with @xmath24 for the circular meniscus , where @xmath25 is the contact angle  @xcite . for the complete or partial wetting condition @xmath26 , the wetting layer spread over the surface which means that heterogeneous nucleation occurs without crossing the energy barrier since @xmath27 from ( [ eq:3 - 11 ] ) .",
    "furthermore the incubation time becomes negative from ( [ eq:3 - 7 ] ) . even in the partial wetting  @xcite condition @xmath28 ,",
    "the energy barrier is lowered @xmath29 and heterogeneous nucleation can occur more easily than homogeneous nucleation . the incubation time for heterogeneous nucleation also becomes shorter than for the homogeneous nucleation  @xcite .",
    "when heterogeneous nucleation can occur near the substrate , we may expect coexistence of heterogeneous nucleation near the substrate and of homogeneous nucleation in the bulk .",
    "then the time evolution of the volume fraction @xmath30 of transformed volume would be given approximately by the superposition of the two contributions : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the transformed volume by homogeneous nucleation ( [ eq:3 - 1 ] ) and @xmath32 is the one by heterogeneous nucleation .",
    "the transformed volume fraction increases due to the simultaneous occurrence of both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation .",
    "the latter contribution can be estimated by considering when the homogeneous nucleation is completely suppressed .",
    "then , we may expect that nucleation occurs only at the substrate as heterogeneous nucleation and new phase growth from substrate as a traveling wave with front velocity @xmath7 .",
    "then , the transformed volume is simply proportional to the time : @xmath33 since the front velocity @xmath7 depends only on the under cooling @xmath34 of the material from ( [ eq:3 - 9 ] ) and does not depend on the existence of the substrate . in this case , the usual kjma formula ( [ eq:3 - 1 ] ) can not be used .    summarizing",
    ", we may expect a few phase transformation scenarios :    1 .",
    "the homogeneous nucleation regime where heterogeneous nucleation can be neglected .",
    "the phase transformation is governed by homogeneous nucleation in the bulk .",
    "this situation occurs when the substrate is no - wet ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "2 .   the heterogeneous nucleation regime where homogeneous nucleation can be neglected .",
    "this can occur when the temperature @xmath36 is low or the undercooling @xmath34 is low and the substrate is wet ( @xmath37 ) because the homogeneous nucleation rate will be low and would not be visible .",
    "the coexistence regime where both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation can exist .",
    "this can occur when the temperature @xmath36 is high or the undercooling @xmath34 is large and the substrate is wet ( @xmath37 ) , then the homogeneous and the heterogeneous nucleation rate as well as the interfacial velocity could be high .    in those cases , the popular kjma kinetic rule given by ( [ eq:3 - 1 ] ) is not applicable .",
    "we have to analyze the transformed volume fraction @xmath30 directly .",
    "we use the standard time - dependent ginzburg landau ( tdgl )  @xcite model to study the dynamics of heterogeneous nucleation .",

    ", the parameter @xmath36 is proportional to the absolute temperature : @xmath52 or the temperature @xmath16 is included through the thermal noise @xmath53 .",
    "since the cell dynamics method is invented not to simulate the mathematical tdgl partial differential equation ( [ eq:2 - 1 ] ) accurately but to simulate and describe the global dynamics directly  @xcite , it certainly can not simulate the high - frequency fluctuation in space and time .",
    "therefore the thermal fluctuation eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 - 5 ] ) can not take into account the short - time fluctuation .",

    "the global shape of the transformation curve @xmath30 does not differ much from that of kjma prediction for the homogeneous nucleation .",

    "figure [ fig:10 ] shows the starting time @xmath124 of phase transformation as the function of the surface field @xmath76 .",
    "since we can not use the kjma formula ( [ eq:3 - 1 ] ) anymore to fit the simulation data to deduce the incubation time @xmath4 , we have used starting time @xmath124 instead .",
    "the figure clearly indicates the expected decrease of starting time @xmath124 as we increase the surface field @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , the phase transformation can start earlier due to the presence of the wet substrate .     of the phase transformation averaged over 50 samples estimated from the evolution of the volume fraction @xmath30 as the function of the surface field @xmath76 when @xmath120 and @xmath146 .",

    "[ fig:11 ] clearly display a large deviation from the kjma prediction of linear relation in early stage of growth . when this surface field is strongly attractive ( @xmath138 ) , in particular , the avrami plot consists of two linear segments with different avrami exponents @xmath3 . in the early stage of transformation @xmath148",
    "while in later stage it becomes @xmath149 , which is very close to the ideal value @xmath20 for two - dimensional isotropic growth predicted from ( [ eq:3 - 9a ] ) .    .",
    "although the curves for the volume fraction @xmath30 all look very similar to the curve for homogeneous nucleation in fig.[fig:9 ] , the avrami plots clearly show the transition from one - dimensional growth at earlier time with a gentle slope with smaller exponent @xmath148 to the two - dimensional growth at later time with a steep slope with larger exponent @xmath149 when the surface field is strongly attractive ( @xmath138 ) . ]    therefore , nucleation at the early stage is dominated by heterogeneous continuous nucleation in 0 dimensions or the site saturation in 1 dimension with avrami exponent @xmath150 from ( [ eq:3 - 9b ] ) .",
    "this contribution from heterogeneous nucleation to the transformed volume @xmath30 is soon suppressed due to the exhaustion of the nucleation site on the bottom substrate . at a later stage",
    ", heterogeneous nucleation is shadowed by homogeneous continuous nucleation which starts inside the bulk material since there is still much of the site to be use for homogeneous nucleation to start .",
    "then the avrami exponent in later stage becomes close to the ideal value @xmath20 predicted from ( [ eq:3 - 9a ] ) for the @xmath21 dimensional continuous nucleation .",
    "in this study , we used the cell dynamics method  @xcite to study the possible scenario of heterogeneous nucleation and growth of new phase in unified manner within the framework of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) model .",
    "we found that the formula for the volume fraction of transformed volume due to kolmogorov - johnson - mehl - avrami ( kjma ) theory and the so - called avrami plot do not necessarily capture the essential future of the dynamics of heterogeneous nucleation . in particular , when the heterogeneous nucleation is dominated , the avrami plot is totally useless .",
    "rather , a simple linear plot of the transformed volume @xmath30 against time could give a linear relation between the transformed volume and time , and the front velocity directly gives the interfacial velocity of phase transformation .",
    "therefore , a naive interpretation of avrami plot when the supporting substrates are changed , needs careful examination  @xcite .",
    "we have also predicted that , in general , heterogeneous nucleation and homogeneous nucleation could coexist .",
    "then the simple avrami plot would consist of two linear segments with inflection .",
    "the avrami exponents @xmath3 of two segments would give the dominant mechanism of phase transformation .",
    "it is predicted that since the heterogeneous nucleation could occur earlier , we might have a smaller avrami exponent an at early stage and a larger avrami exponent at a later stage .",
    "since the tdgl model with the cell dynamics method is flexible and computationally simple , yet it has a direct connection to the thermodynamics of the system considered , it can be used to study various scenarios of the dynamics of phase transformations .",
    "in fact it has already applied to those materials with a complex phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "although standard cellular automaton  @xcite and the lattice model  @xcite could also be used to simulate the complex dynamics of phase transformation , they have to introduce an artificial evolution processes algorithmically . on the other hand ,",
    "the evolution in our cell dynamics method is driven by the free energy and the thermal noise , and it is completely free from artificial parameters . therefore , our tdgl model with cell dynamics method is more natural and easy to use in the study of various phase transformation scenarios , in particular , of the time evolution including the incubation time without introducing many unknown and uncontrollable parameters .",
