    "whenever one finds a new way to construct interesting varieties , one is subsequently presented with the task of computing algebraic and topological invariants . we address in this paper the case of surfaces with semi - log - canonical ( slc ) singularities .",
    "semi - log - canonical surfaces with ample canonical divisor are called stable and their moduli space is a natural compactification of the gieseker moduli space of canonical models of surfaces of general type ( see @xcite ) . indeed , this was one of the motivations for the introduction of this class of singularities by kollr and shepherd - barron in @xcite .    here",
    "we start by giving a general method to compute ( co)homology and fundamental group of a variety ( or complex space ) from a birational modification ( cf .",
    "section [ section : computations ] ) ; in the applications this can be , for instance , the normalisation or a partial resolution .",
    "then we explain how to compute the irregularity @xmath3 and also the automorphism group of a non - normal slc surface .",
    "our motivation for these results comes from our work in progress on gorenstein stable surfaces with @xmath0 begun in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , since minimal surfaces of general type with @xmath0 are known to be regular , we wished to decide whether the same is true in the stable case . in the smooth case regularity",
    "is proven via a covering trick : if @xmath4 there exist tale coverings of arbitrary degree and",
    "these would violate the noether - inequality ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "14 ) ) .    for stable surfaces , even gorenstein , this argument does not work because the slope of the noether line is 1 @xcite .",
    "still , the situation is remarkably similar :    there are exactly two irregular gorenstein stable surfaces with @xmath0 .",
    "they both have @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the same normalisation ( @xmath7 ) , the same integral homology and picard group , but they have different homotopy type .",
    "each one of these surfaces corresponds to a connected component of the moduli space of ( not necessarily gorenstein ) stable surfaces with @xmath0 .",
    "since smooth surfaces of general type have @xmath8 , the irregular surfaces we find can not be smoothable . a natural question raised by theorem",
    "a is whether there are non - gorenstein stable surfaces with @xmath0 and @xmath9 .",
    "our proof consists of two steps : first in section [ section : classical ] we prove by `` classical '' methods ( restriction to a canonical curve ) that if @xmath8 and @xmath0 then @xmath10 . by the results of @xcite",
    ", this implies that an irregular surface @xmath11 with @xmath0 has @xmath5 and is a projective plane glued to itself along four lines .",
    "secondly , in section  [ section : 4 lines ] we classify gorenstein stable surfaces constructed from the projective plane glued to itself along four lines , showing in particular that there are exactly two with @xmath5 .",
    "the topological and algebraic invariants of these surfaces are computed in the last section [ section : chi=0 ] , using the methods previously devised .    in a forthcoming work we will study the gorenstein stable surfaces with @xmath12 and @xmath8 ( hence @xmath10 ) and their moduli spaces .",
