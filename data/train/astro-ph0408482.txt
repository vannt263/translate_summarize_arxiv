    "the strong extinction even at nir wavelengths prevents the direct view on the embedded pre - main sequence ( pms ) star .",
    "however , it can be located using imaging polarimetry @xcite since in the case of a single illuminating source , the polarization vector of single - scattered photons is perpendicular to the radius vector .",
    "the polarization pattern of ysos is indicative for the dust properties and can often be explained by scattering in a circumstellar disk / envelope with bipolar cavities @xcite .",

    "the almost edge - on view of the circumstellar disk ( launhardt & sargent 2001 ; see also sect .",

    "the morphology and sed of the embedded yso resembles that of low - mass classi source consisting of a pms star surrounded by a circumstellar disk embedded in an envelope .",
    "while the embedded yso is not seen directly due to high extinction in the surrounding disk , stellar light scattered at dust grains in the envelope below and above the disk becomes evident as bipolar nir reflection nebula .    the observed centro - symmetric polarization pattern ( fig . [ fig - k ] )",
    "is caused by light scattering in this bipolar geometry , resulting in very high values of @xmath39% at the outer lobes due to single scattering .",
    "the linearly aligned polarization vectors close to the disk might be caused by back - scattering from the envelope onto the optically thick disk @xcite or by multiple scattering in the outer disk regions @xcite .",
    "the central extinction lane which bisects the nebula is the signature of the disk . in the case of cb26 ,",
    "this was directly demonstrated by spatially resolved mm observations of the thermal dust emission from the disk which precisely resembles the position , size , shape , and orientation of the extinction lane ( launhardt & sargent 2001 ; see their fig .",
    "the disk must be seen almost edge on since none of the nir lobes seems to be strongly shadowed .",
    "this is consistent with a preliminary model to the mm dust emission from the disk which suggests an inclination angle of @xmath405 .",
    "an independent estimate of the disk inclination can be derived from the kinematics of the hho ( cf .",
    "section [ sec - dis - hh ] ) .",
    "the morphology and colors of the nir reflection nebula give no solid clue on which side of the disk might be tilted toward the observer . while the slightly brighter and bluer south - eastern lobe may indicate that this side is tilted toward the observer , the presence of the conical extension to the north - west ( fig .",
    "[ fig - j ] ) and the possible small displacement of the center of illumination with respect to the center of the disk ( fig .",
    "[ fig - k ] ) point toward the other direction .",
    "however , the displacement is within the range of the astrometric uncertainties and we can not rule out that differences in the appearance of the bipolar lobes are due to varying extinction .",
    "evidence for non - uniform extinction comes from an additional , more diffuse extinction lane between the compact north - western lobe and the more diffuse north - west extension of the nir nebula which might be due to either an irregular shape of the remnant envelope or a foreground filament ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - col ] ) .",
    "the different resolution of the j , h , and ks images due to the variation of the seeing precluded the derivation of dust grain properties from the wavelength dependence of the extinction lane and the observed polarization @xcite .",
    "we also note that the south - western bright rim of the globule which is close to cb26  yso1 coincides with a radio source that is present in 1.6ghz and 4.85ghz surveys @xcite .",
    "the flux densities at these frequencies are 106 and 30mjy , respectively , indicating a non - thermal origin .",
    "thus , the radio source seems to be unrelated to cb26 .",
    "although the central illuminating star is not visible due to the high extinction , its presence and location could be unambiguously identified by means of the imaging polarimetry ( cf .",
    "sect.[sec - res ] ) . within the errors",
    "it is situated at the center of the mm disk .",
    "the luminosity of cb26  yso1 of @xmath41 , which was derived by integrating the sed over 4@xmath28 , is only a lower limit to the intrinsic luminosity of the embedded star since the bipolar geometry causes an anisotropic radiation field where , due to the edge - on view , only a fraction of the nir photons are scattered into the line of sight .",
    "however , anisotropic radiation is not expected for the thermal fir to mm emission , which contributes 95%  to the total luminosity .",
    "thus , even a very high anisotropy correction factor of 10 would increase the bolometric luminosity by only 50% . on the other hand , heating of such an isolated low - mass cloud core by the interstellar radiation field might not be negligible ( e.g. , siebenmorgen , kruegel , & mathis 1992 ) , resulting in an overestimation of the intrinsic luminosity of the embedded yso . together with the dynamic mass estimate for the pms star by @xcite of 0.3m@xmath42 , a bolometric stellar luminosity of @xmath10.5l@xmath0yields an upper limit for the age of 10@xmath2yr based on the solar - metalicity pms tracks of . from the sed",
    "we calculate a ratio @xmath43  for cb26yso1 . according to @xcite",
    "this ratio would be indicative of a class0 protostar since it is significantly higher than the threshold value @xmath44 .",
    "however , this threshold value was derived from the assumption of spherical symmetry which does no longer hold for classi ysos . according to the morphology and age",
    ", cb26  yso1 is clearly a classi object .",
    "the particularly large discrepancy in this case is most likely due to both the unusually large and massive disk and the extreme edge - on view .",
    "this also demonstrates that a single parameter like the @xmath45  ratio can not be used to unambigeously classify an individual source , although it may be useful to analyse ( in a statistical sense ) a larger sample of objects .",
    "the iras non - detection at 12 and 25@xmath33 m , which is non - typical for a classi source , is most likely due to the extreme edge - on morphology and the resulting high extinction for the mir emission from hot dust in the inner disk .",
    "since x - ray activity is a sign of low - mass ysos @xcite , we searched the rosat archive for a possible x - ray counterpart . indeed , there are deep rosat images of this area but the superposition with the strong supernova remnant 1h  0455 + 518 @xcite makes it difficult to detect cb26  yso1 .",
    "the newly discovered hho494 is well aligned with the symmetry axis of cb26  irs1 , suggesting a physical relation between the two .",
    "there is no other star - formation activity in the region which could possibly be responsible for the herbig - haro flow .",
    "the neighboring globules cb24 and cb25 are quiescent and do not harbor any infrared sources seen in the 2mass survey or by iras .",
    "the only other iras source in the vicinity is 04554 + 5210 to the north - west , at about the same projected distance as 04559 + 5200 .",
    "it is only detected at 100  with a flux of 4.4jy and there is no evidence for star formation for this source .",
    "the absence of other possible driving sources for the herbig - haro flow in the field supports our view that hho494 is due to the outflow activity from cb26  yso1 .    the radial velocity of hho494 of @xmath38km / s is blueshifted with respect to the systemic radial velocity of the disk @xmath46km / s @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the north - western lobe of cb26  irs1 is tilted toward the observer .",
    "the assumption of a maximum disk inclination of 5@xmath47 ( cf .",
    "sect.[sec - dis - morph ] ) leads to a velocity estimate of the herbig - haro flow of at least 500km / s .",
    "although such a flow velocity seems rather high , it is not uncommon for herbig - haro flows from classi ysos , e.g. , hh111 @xcite , hh395 ( stecklum et al . , in prep . ) and consistent with the absence of a correlation between source luminosity and flow velocity .",
    "however , an independent estimate of the total flow speed can be derived from the detection of hho494 on the poss - ii - f and ccd narrow - band images .",
    "the epoch difference between these observations amounts to 4.4yr .",
    "the positional coincidence suggests that any proper motion must be smaller than the pixel size of @xmath141 . with the assumption of a neglible proper motion of the mm disk ,",
    "this yields an upper limit for the tangential velocity component of 150km / s which implies an overall flow velocity of @xmath40160km / s .",
    "since this estimate of the tangential velocity is based on direct measurements , we prefer it over the value resulting from the radiative transfer model .",
    "consequently , the disk inclination can not be smaller than 18 if the jet is perpendicular to the disk , i.e. in the absence of any precession . when combined with the linear separation of the hho from cb26  yso1 the upper bound on the tangential velocity yields a lower limit for the dynamic time - scale of about 1600yr",
    ".    ratios of the emission line strengths are a good diagnostic of the excitation conditions , @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the [ sii ] 6717  and 6731  lines is insensitive to the electron temperature , thus allowing the determination of the electron density @xcite which amounts to @xmath48@xmath49 .",
    "an upper limit for @xmath50 of 230@xmath49 is set by the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectrum .",
    "the ratio of the [ nii ] 6583and [ oi ] 6300  lines is tracing the ionization fraction and almost independent of pre - shock density and magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "the derived value for the ionization fraction of 0.25@xmath510.05 implies a total gas density of about 200@xmath49 .",
    "this rather low density suggests that the herbig - haro flow is propagating into an environment more similar to the interstellar medium than a molecular cloud . at such densities",
    "the braking of the flow by the ambient medium is presumably not very efficient which might explain the observed high flow velocity . from the line ratio of [ nii ] 6583  to [ oi ] 6300  we also infer the shock velocity of 55@xmath515km / s assuming the low - preshock density case of @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the shock velocity , i.e. , the relative velocity of the excited matter in the herbig - haro flow , to the flow speed of @xmath14500km / s implies that the hho494 does not represent the terminal shock .",
    "the presence of the hho indicates recent outflow activity and ongoing accretion .",
    "indeed @xcite find indirect signatures of ongoing accretion and a possible disk wind .",
    "however , no large - scale molecular outflow has been detected so far which might be due the lack of sufficiently dense molecular gas in and around this nearly dispersed globule .",
    "no hho was found for the counter flow within 20  south - east of cb26  yso1 .",
    "this is presumably due to the low density of the ambient matter which precludes shock formation .",

    "we report high - resolution nir observations of a yso in the bok globule cb26 .",

    "here we use nir images and polarimetry of the reflection nebula to deduce the morphology of the envelope and the location and age of the central illuminating star . we also report the discovery of a herbig - haro flow from this source and derive further constraints on the morphology and evolutionary stage of the yso - disk - envelope system .",

    "the nir reflection nebula has a bipolar shape and is bisected by an extinction lane due to an edge - on seen circumstellar disk .",

    "the very small value of the disk inclination suggested by the mm results ( @xmath405 ) is inconsistent with the estimate based on the velocity components of the herbig - haro flow ( @xmath5418 ) .",
    "this discrepancy might be solved by invoking a precession of the flow , e.g. due to a binary star or other mechanisms @xcite . settling the issue of the disk inclination",

    "the system is however distinguished by its extreme edge - on view , i.e. , the symmetry axis is oriented very close to the plane of the sky .",

    "<S> we report on results of near - infrared and optical observations of the mm disk embedded in the bok globule cb26 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the near - infrared images show a bipolar reflection nebula with a central extinction lane which coincides with the mm disk . </S>",
    "<S> imaging polarimetry of this object yielded a polarization pattern which is typical for a young stellar object surrounded by a large circumstellar disk and an envelope , seen almost edge - on . </S>",
    "<S> the strong linear polarization in the bipolar lobes is caused by single scattering at dust grains and allowed to locate the illuminating source which coincides with the center of the mm disk . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral energy distribution of the yso embedded in cb26 resembles that of a class  i source with a luminosity of 0.5l@xmath0 . using the pre - main - sequence evolutionary tracks and the stellar mass inferred from the rotation curve of the disk </S>",
    "<S> , we derive an age of the system of @xmath110@xmath2yr . h@xmath3 and [ sii ] narrow - band imaging as well as </S>",
    "<S> optical spectroscopy revealed an herbig - haro object @xmath4 northwest of cb26  yso1 , perfectly aligned with the symmetry axis of the bipolar nebula . </S>",
    "<S> this herbig - haro object ( hh494 ) indicates ongoing accretion and outflow activity in cb26  yso1 . </S>",
    "<S> its excitation characteristics indicate that the herbig - haro flow is propagating into a low - density environment . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that cb26  yso1 represents the transition stage between embedded protostellar accretion disks and more evolved protoplanetary disks around t tauri stars in an undisturbed environment . </S>"
