    "[ [ section ] ]    it is well known that nuclear matter below saturation exhibits a first - order phase transition belonging to the liquid - gas ( lg ) universality class @xcite .",
    "the study of the associated phase diagram is not only a playground for many - body theorists , but it is also of clear relevance for nuclear phenomenology , since the very existence of atomic nuclei can be understood as a finite size manifestation of that phase transition . in a similar way , one can ask whether the existence of hypernuclei as bound systems implies the presence of a similar phase transition in the extended phase diagram where strangeness represents an extra dimension .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    since the first synthesis of @xmath0-hypernuclei in the 80 s , numerous nuclear matter studies including hyperons have been performed @xcite .",
    "these early studies assumed very attractive couplings in the strange sector in order to justify the extra binding measurements of double @xmath0-hypernuclei @xcite . as a consequence , it was predicted that multi - strange clusters and even strangelets could be stable and possibly accessible in heavy - ion collisions . in particular in ref.@xcite , the occurrence of a thermodynamic phase transition in strange compressed baryonic matter",
    "was predicted , which would lead to a new family of neutron stars characterized by much smaller radii than usually considered .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    however , more recent analysis @xcite of double @xmath0-hypernuclei tend to suggest a very small attraction in the @xmath1 channel , and the stability of pure @xmath0-matter seems to be ruled out .",

    ", no hyperons appear below baryonic densities of the order of 3@xmath3 or more .",
    "for this reason , the influence of strangeness on the low density nuclear matter phase diagram was never studied to our knowledge .",
    "still , the existence of single and double @xmath0-hypernuclei , and the very active research on multiply strange nuclei with the advent of new dedicated experimental programs such as j - parc in japan or panda at fair @xcite suggests that the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition should be preserved by the consideration of the strangeness degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    in this paper , we explore the influence of strangeness on the lg phase transition with popular relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) models .",
    "like in any other phenomenological effective model , the couplings of the rmf are not fully known even at subsaturation densities . in particular , neutron star physics",
    "has taught us in the recent years that it is important to go beyond a simple su(6 ) or even su(3 ) symmetry , and extra attractive @xmath4 and repulsive @xmath5 mesons specifically coupled to the strange baryons should be introduced @xcite , which leads to a potentially uncontrolled multiplication of parameters . however ,",
    "if we limit ourselves to the simple system composed of neutrons , protons and @xmath0-hyperons , nuclear and hypernuclear structure provide some constraints that can be used to limit the parameter space of the model . in this paper",

    "we show that in the whole parameter space the lg phase transition is preserved by the addition of strangeness , even if the extension of the spinodal along the strange density direction is subject to large uncertainties .",
    "the instability zone is globally quenched by strangeness , but the strange density is an order parameter of the transition .",
    "this means that from the thermodynamic point of view , the formation of hyperclusters with multiple @xmath0 s should be favored at low density @xcite , which has possible implications in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",

    "fig.[figure 05 ] ( a ) shows the binding energy for pure neutron matter .",
    "it is known since a long time that rmf models are systematically too stiff at high neutron density in comparison to ab - initio models .",
    "however we can see that for the sub - saturation densities of interest for the present paper , the lwm agrees very well with the afdmc , better than the nlwm , which in principle should be more sophisticated .",

    "in this regime , the values of the @xmath0 coupling do not play an important role , and the same level of reproduction is obtained for different choices of @xmath71 .",
    "[ [ section-28 ] ]    the effect of three - body forces increases with increasing @xmath0-fraction , and consequently the three versions of the afdmc calculation start to considerably deviating from each other at the highest @xmath0-fraction considered by the authors of @xcite ( fig.[figure 05 ] ( d ) ) . in this condition ,",
    "the afdmc ( @xmath72 ) becomes very bound , due to the attractive feature of the @xmath72 potential , while the three - body force in afmdc ( i ) and ( ii ) insures the necessary repulsion to sustain massive neutron stars .",

    "we have observed that @xmath42 is more sensitive to changes in @xmath74 than @xmath75 as seen in figs.[figure 04 ] ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "no matter how much we change these parameters , we do not notably change the degree of agreement between the rmf models and the afdmc . in this sense",
    "the orange and green curves in fig.[figure 05 ] ( d ) represent extreme choices for the rmf couplings in the two versions lwm ( full lines ) and nlwm ( dashed lines ) . to conclude , the inclusion of strange mesons is necessary to produce a rmf energy functional compatible with ab - initio results at low baryonic density . for very low @xmath0-fractions ,",
    "as it is the case in hypernuclei , the sensistivity to the @xmath0 couplings is very small , and the lwm surprisingly leads to a very good agreement to the afdmc parametrization .",
    "however neither the linear nor the non - linear version of the wm are satisfactory , if one wants to describe matter with a non - negligible proportion of @xmath0 s , and a dedicated fit with density dependent couplings should be done to reduce the parameter space . for the purpose of the present paper",
    "we will continue with both models in our further analysis , keeping in mind that lwm results well reproduce ab - initio pure neutron matter , while nlwm with low values of @xmath76 should give a reasonably realistic description of symmetric and asymmetric matter with an important contribution of strangeness .",
    "[ [ section-29 ] ]    in the present section we focus on the calculation of the instabilities in a system with neutrons , protons and @xmath0 s at @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "a first order phase transition is signaled by an instability or concavity anomaly in the mean - field thermodynamic total energy density .",
    "the total energy density of threee - component system is a three variable function of the densities .",

    "the remarkable feature of the liquid - gas phase transition is that one of all eigenvalues is negative and the associated eigenvector gives the instability direction @xcite , what means that the energy surface is of a hyperbolic kind .",
    "therefore , in the case of the simpler n@xmath0 system for a negative eigenvalue the ratio ( [ ratios_general ] ) became @xmath111the next equation will be useful in the discussion about the ratio for np@xmath0 system with symmetric condition @xmath112",
    ". @xmath113    [ [ section-30 ] ]    in the next section we comment our results .",
    "[ [ section-31 ] ]    in order to understand the instabilities possibly present in the models discussed in sections iii and iv , we need the analysis done in the last section .",
    "we have calculated the curvature matrix with the ab - initio and rmf models .",
    "the whole density space is a three - dimensional space and the spinodal region , when it occurs , is a three - dimensional volume that represents a geometric _ locus _ associated with the presence , at least , of one negative eigenvalue .",
    "it is well known that in two - component systems with neutrons and protons the liquid - gas phase transition occurs .",
    "the corresponding two - dimensional spinodal zone appears below the saturation density .",
    "so , in this system , one of the eingenvalues is negative . for a more complex system , with neutrons , protons and @xmath0 s for example",
    ", we can fix the @xmath0-fraction to see how the two - dimensional spinodal region in the neutron - proton plane changes when lambdas are added .",
    "in all the models analyzed , for any proton fraction , and with all the different choices of couplings , we have systematically found one and only one negative eigenvalue in a finite density space defining a spinodal region . the only exception is given by the n@xmath0 system studied with the lwm , which does not present any instability .",
    "however the instability is there in the ab - initio model , and it appears in the lwm as soon as a non - zero proton fraction is added to the system , meaning that the result of the lwm n@xmath0 mixture appears rather marginal .",
    "[ [ section-32 ] ]    therefore we can conclude that a transition exists in the subsaturation nuclear matter including @xmath0 hyperons , and this transition belongs to the liquid - gas universality class . in the following",
    ", we turn to study the characteristics of this transition in further details .",
    "[ [ section-33 ] ]    in fig.[figure 06 ] we plot the spinodal areas in a system containing only neutrons and @xmath0 s . in fig.[figure 06 ] ( a ) two spinodal zones for the two different parameterizations of the ab - initio model including three - body forces are shown . the behavior at high @xmath0-density should be considered with caution , since the afdmc calculations were only done for @xmath114 . in fig.[figure 06 ] ( b ) ,",
    "different spinodal zones are shown for the nlwm taking into account different values of the strange mesons coupling constants .",
    "two more spinodal curves for neutron-@xmath0 matter without strange mesons are also displayed in fig.[figure 06 ] ( c ) .",
    "note that none of these shapes touch the horizontal axis nor the vertical one , even if they look very close to the @xmath115 axis for some of the models .",
    "this result is due to the fact that pure neutron and pure @xmath0-matter are unbound .",
    "indeed the spinodal instability at zero temperature leads to a phase transition where the system splits into two phases , the dense one representing the bound ground state . in the absence of a bound ground state , it is thus normal that the instability disappears . in the following , whenever the spinodal zone does not touch the axis",
    "it is clear that the reason underlying this behavior is an unbound system .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the widest extension of the instability is obtained with the most repulsive model .",
    "this counterintuitive result probably stems from the fact that the highest repulsion at high density is correlated to a stronger attraction at low density also in the ab - initio model .",
    "the behavior of the unstable eigenvector , shown in figs.[figure 07 ] ( a ) and ( b ) for the two rmf parameter sets that better reproduce the ab - initio eos , is also interesting .",
    "we can see that it is close to the isoscalar direction @xmath116 as it is in the standard lg @xcite .",
    "this simply means that the transition is between a dense and a diluted phase . in finite systems",
    ", the dense phase corresponds to an hypernucleus , and the dilute phase to a ( hyper)-gas ( which at @xmath77 corresponds to zero density , and wich would exist and would be in equilibrium with the hypernucleus at finite temperature ) .",
    "fig.[figure 07 ] ( c ) shows the ratio @xmath117 as a function of the @xmath118 for some couplings and baryon densities for @xmath119 .",
    "we can see that for very low @xmath0 fractions , the direction of phase separation is steeper than the constant @xmath0-fraction line .",
    "this means that the dense phase is more symmetric than the dilute phase .",
    "we also depict the line that represents @xmath120 , so that it becomes visually easy to compare it with the direction of the eigenvectors .",
    "[ [ section-34 ] ]    the instability direction can be better spotted from fig.[figure 07 ] ( c ) , which displays the unstable eigenvector as a function of the @xmath0 fraction .",
    "we can see that the unstable eigenvectors are almost independent of the baryonic density .",
    "this means that the proportion of @xmath0 in the dense phase following the spinodal decomposition is the same whatever the timescales and dynamics in the spinodal zone , and is well defined by the direction of the unstable eigenvectors .",
    "this proportion monotonically increase with the @xmath0 fraction , but never reach the equality between neutrons and @xmath0 .",
    "this feature is due to the mass difference between the two baryonic species , as well as to the reduced attraction in the @xmath0 channel .",
    "it is at variance with the ordinary nuclear liquid - gas which is associated to the fractionation or distillation phenomenon @xcite , with the dense phase being systematically more symmetric than the dilute phase ( see fig.[figure 09 ] ) .",
    "the optimal proportion of @xmath0 increases with increasing the scalar coupling , as it can be intuitively expected .",
    "[ [ section-35 ] ]    now we would like to see how this affects the spinodal zone calculations in the three - component system , which is more relevant for nuclear physics applications .",
    "fig.[figure 08 ] shows the three - dimensional spinodal volumes for particular cases : @xmath121 and @xmath122 in the nlwm .",
    "the behavior shown in both figures does not depend on the couplings used .",
    "the general pattern is always the same . in fig.[figure 08 ] ( a ) the blue contour and dots are the surface of the spinodal volume and the red shapes mean the slices in the orthogonal planes of this volume .",
    "shape ( 1 ) represents the neutron - lambda spinodal area , ( 2 ) proton - lambda spinodal area and ( 3 ) neutron - proton spinodal area .",
    "the red dashed curve ( 4 ) shows the vertical plane that cuts the volume passing by @xmath112 .",

    "@xmath123 is the special value we choose for further analysis and is highlighted in red .",
    "[ [ section-36 ] ]    analogue pictures for the lwm are quite similar , apart from the fact that the size is a little bigger and no shapes ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are present .",
    "hence , in the following when we report different cuts of three - dimensional spinodal picture in rmf models , we assume that fig.[figure 08 ] is useful to illustrate the cases lwm and nlwm .",
    "[ [ section-37 ] ]    a first interesting cut is at constant @xmath0 fraction , because it leads to the same representation as for the usual lg phase transition , which is obtained in the limit @xmath124 .",

    "we recall from section [ abinitio ] that at low density the lwm is more realistic for the case @xmath124 ( left side ) , while the nlwm is in better agreement with the ab - initio model for important @xmath0-fractions ( right side ) . in any case",
    "we can see that the phase diagrams of the two models are very similar , the nlwm instability zone being only slightly narrower .",

    "as it is well known , the instability covers a huge part of the sub - saturation region and has an essentially isoscalar character . the unstable eigenvectors point towards a direction which is intermediate between the isoscalar direction ( observed only for symmetric matter @xmath128 ) , and the direction of constant isospin . as a consequence ,",
    "the dense phase is systematically more symmetric than the dilute phase .",
    "indeed , at zero temperature the dilute phase is a pure gas of neutrons ( protons ) if the system is neutron ( proton ) rich @xcite . from panels ( a ) and ( c ) of fig.[figure 10 ] we additionally learn that the lg instability is clearly preserved by the addition of strangeness .",

    "this quenching is small . on the other side ,",
    "when @xmath75 increases , the modification on the spinodal is very small .",
    "this is expected , since the strange mesons are only coupled to strange baryons and are therefore expected to affect essentially the @xmath0 density , which is not represented here . due to the weak effect of @xmath75 in the spinodal frontier we select the value @xmath122 to study the eigenvectors in the neutron - proton plane displayed in the next figures . for the nlwm spinodal area shown in fig.[figure 10 ] ( b ) and the vectors represent the projection of the unstable eigenvectors on the neutron - proton plane . in fig.[figure 10 ] ( c ) the ratio @xmath126 are plotted as a function of the proton fraction .",
    "no difference can be seen with respect to the normal lg : whatever the percentage of @xmath0 s , the neutron - proton composition of the dense phase ( i.e. the hypernucleus ) is unmodified , even if the density is reduced .",
    "[ [ section-39 ] ]    this finding might seem in contradiction with recent studies in multiply strange hypernuclei @xcite , where it is seen that the driplines are modified by the @xmath0-fraction .",
    "however these modifications are essentially due to shell and coulomb effects , which are not accounted for in this infinite matter calculation .",
    "if we change our perspective from the neutron - proton plane to imagine the general three - dimensional spinodal _ locus _ and instead of fixing @xmath118 as before , we fix the symmetric matter condition @xmath129 , the resulting plane slice crossing this three - dimensional volume is similar to the curve denoted by number ( 4 ) in fig.[figure 08 ] ( a ) . the related spinodal areas for the nlwm and",
    "many choices of the coupling parameters are shown in fig.[figure 11 ] .",
    "[ [ section-40 ] ]    the comparison to the ab - initio model of section [ abinitio ] suggests that the most realistic phase diagram should be between the ones corresponding to @xmath130 , which gives an energy functional intermediate between the two afdmc parametrizations of three - body forces .",
    "we can see that the coupling to the strange meson @xmath75 has a bigger effect in this plane as expected .",
    "still , its influence on the spinodal is small .",
    "this means that the wide uncertainty on the strange mesons has a negligible influence on the phase transition .",
    "the biggest uncertainty concerns the extension of the spinodal zone along the @xmath131 axis .",
    "it is however important to stress that this situation @xmath132 does not correspond to any known physical system .",
    "every shape shown touches the horizontal axis when @xmath133 , as it should be considering that the np system is bound . at this point",
    "we can report to fig.[figure 03 ] , to see that our restriction of @xmath74 does not affect much the spinodal zone analysis because when we increase @xmath74 up to @xmath134 the spinodal zone tends to become flatter in the @xmath0-density direction .",
    "even if the calculation might be not realistic for very high @xmath0-fraction , we can conclude that the lg phase transition is still present in multistrange systems .",
    "[ [ section-41 ] ]    finally , figs.[figure 12 ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the projections of the unstable eigenvectors in the @xmath0-nucleon plane .",
    "we can see that a non negligible component of the order parameter lies along the @xmath131 direction , meaning that the @xmath0-density is an order parameter of the phase transition , or in other words that the dense phase is also the phase with the higher strangeness content .",
    "these eigenvectors are almost parallel to each other , and considerably deviate with respect to the direction of the constant @xmath0-fraction lines as seen in fig.[figure 12 ] ( c ) .",
    "interesting enough , the instability points towards an  optimal \" composition @xmath135 for the dense phase , whatever the baryonic density , coupling constants and @xmath0 fraction . only for very small and very high @xmath0",
    "fraction a deviation is observed .",
    "this is expected because by construction the instability must tend towards the non - strange direction in the absence of strangeness .",
    "it will be very interesting to verify if such an optimal composition is obtained in calculations of multiple - strange hypernuclei .",
    "as in the case of the simpler @xmath136 system , the fact that the instability always points towards @xmath0 poor systems is at variance with the distillation phenomenon , characteristic of the lg phase transition with more than one component @xcite , where the direction of phase separation tends to equal composition .",
    "this symmetry breaking between nucleons and @xmath0 s comes from the difference in the bare mass of the particles and the less attractive couplings .",
    "still , for very low @xmath0 fractions , the direction of phase separation is steeper than the constant @xmath0-fraction line .",
    "this means that the dense phase is more symmetric than the dilute phase .",
    "this thermodynamic finding is compatible with the observation in ref.@xcite that the @xmath0 s produced in heavy - ion collisions should stick to the clusters ( i.e. , the dense phase ) rather than being emitted as free particles ( i.e. , the gas ) .",
    "[ [ section-42 ] ]    we have investigated the thermodynamic phase diagram at subsaturation density , for baryonic matter including neutrons , protons and @xmath0 hyperons , within a rmf approach . for the nucleonic eos , we have considered the gm1 parametrization of nlwm , together with the simpler lwm .",
    "strange mesons were included to allow a wide exploration of the possible phenomenology for the ( still largely unknown ) hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon couplings , with minimal requirements on the potential depths extracted from hypernuclear data .",
    "imposing these requirements leads to a strong linear correlation between the attractive and the repulsive couplings , both for the normal and the strange mesons .",
    "these constraints leave us with a two - dimensional parameter space , which we have varied widely in order to pin down generic features of the phase diagram .",
    "our main focus was the understanding of the instabilities in the hypernuclear matter , and specifically the influence of @xmath0 s in the well known liquid - gas phase transition of nuclear matter .",
    "the existence of an instability as a signature of a first order phase transition was identified by analyzing the curvature of the thermodynamic potential with respect to the nucleonic and strange densities . in all our studies one and",
    "only one negative eigenvalue has been found , showing that the phase transition still exists in the presence of strangeness and is still of lg type , even if its extension in the density space shrinks with increasing strangeness .",
    "the negative eigenvalue corresponds to the direction in density space , in which density fluctuations get spontaneously and exponentially amplified in order to achieve phase separation .",
    "this eigenvalue is seen to systematically have a non - negligible component in the direction of the strange density .",
    "this means that strangeness can be viewed as an order parameter of the transition .",
    "less expected is the fact that the instability direction systematically points to a fixed proportion of @xmath0 s in the dense phase , at variance with the phenomenon of distillation typical of binary mixtures .",
    "this proportion being of the order of 30% in the models we considered , this means that in a dilute system with a small contribution of @xmath0 s , these latter will preferentially belong to the dense clusterized phase .",
    "these conclusions are general and appear largely model independent . on the contrary , the specific shape of the phase diagram would obviously depend on the choice of the free @xmath137 and @xmath138 couplings . some hints on a more quantitative estimation of the thermodynamics",
    "were obtained from the analysis of the simpler n@xmath0 phase diagram extracted from the ab - initio afdmc calculation of ref.@xcite .",
    "the characteristics of the phase transition are confirmed in the ab - initio model , even if the phase diagram extension depends on the three - body force model in an important way .",
    "the comparison of the rmf with the afdmc also reveals some limitations of the phenomenological model at low density .",
    "indeed the popular gm1 model is shown to compare very poorely to the ab - initio calculation of pure neutron matter even at the low densities considered in the present study .",
    "unexpectedly , the simpler lwm is in very good agreement with the ab - initio predictions at low density .",
    "concerning the n@xmath0 mixture , the energy functional is within the theoretical error bars if @xmath139 .. other parameterizations could change the quantitative results that we have presented in this paper . in particular",
    "a recent work @xcite shows that the scalar - isovector @xmath140 meson also plays an important role in satisfying both nuclear bulk and stellar properties constraints .",
    "the use of another parameter set and/or the inclusion of this new degree of freedom requires a complete calculation from the very beginning because the nucleon - lambda potential , eq.([uln_contraint_densities ] ) , has to be readjusted .",
    "however , the qualitative results will be certainly similar , since the whole 3d parameter space associated to strangeness was spanned . as a perspective for future work",
    ", it will be very interesting to analyze the instability behavior of a density dependent coupling rmf model , directly fitted to the ab - initio calculation ."
