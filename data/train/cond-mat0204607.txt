    "the exchange bias phenomenon is associated with the interfacial exchange coupling between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin structures , resulting in an unidirectional magnetic anisotropy that causes a shift of the hysteresis loop to negative field values as one cools the system through the nel temperature of the antiferromagnet(af ) in a positive magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the exchange bias effect is essential for the development of magneto - electronic switching devices ( spin - valves ) and for random access magnetic storage units . for these applications a predictable , robust , and tunable exchange bias effect",
    "is required .",
    "extensive data have been collected on the exchange bias field @xmath0 , and the coercivity field @xmath1 , for a large number of bilayer systems , which are reviewed in ref .",
    "the details of the eb effect depend crucially on the af / f combination chosen and on the structure and thickness of the films .",
    "however , some characteristic features apply to most systems : ( 1 ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 increase as the system is cooled in an applied magnetic field below the blocking temperature @xmath2 of the af layer , where @xmath3 is the nel temperature of the af layer ; ( 2 ) the magnetization reversal can be different for the ascending and descending part of the hysteresis loop @xcite , as was first pointed out in reference @xcite , and recently also observed by lee et al .",

    "@xcite ; ( 3 ) thermal relaxation effects of @xmath0 and @xmath1 indicate that a stable magnetic state is reached only at very low temperatures @xcite . furthermore",
    ", a positive @xmath0 has been observed after cooling an af / f system in very high magnetic fields  @xcite , and a perpendicular exchange bias was realized by using a ferromagnetic layer with perpendicular anisotropy @xcite .",
    "several theoretical models have been developed for describing possible mechanisms of the eb effect , including domain formation in the af layer with domain walls perpendicular to the af / f interface @xcite , creation of uncompensated excess af spins at the interface @xcite , or the formation of a domain wall in the af layer parallel to the interface @xcite .",

    "recent overviews of theoretical models on the exchange bias effect are provided by stamps @xcite and by kiwi @xcite .",
    "however , so far there is still not a satisfactory agreement between the different theoretical approaches and experimental observations of the macroscopic and microscopic response of exchange bias systems .    one step forward in describing the exchange field behavior , as we will demonstrate in the present report , could come from a detailed analysis and understanding of the asymmetric behavior of the magnetization reversal and relaxation processes of the magnetization close to the coercive fields . to this end",
    ", we have chosen to investigate the archetypal coo / co(111 ) af / f exchange bias system because it offers a number of advantages over similar systems , which show also the eb effect .",
    "first , co has very good growth properties as a thin film and very flat interfaces can be prepared by sputtering and molecular beam epitaxial techniques .",
    "second , the nel temperature of the oxide is at a convenient temperature of @xmath5  k. third , coo provides a large eb even for very thin layers , which can easily be prepared by thermal oxidation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , coo / co bilayers exhibit straightforward and pronounced eb properties , which qualifies them as a model system for detailed investigations of the magnetization reversal process  @xcite .",
    "this is the case although the spin structure of the antiferromagnetic coo is rather complex . in coo",
    "the spin - orbit interaction and therefore the crystal anisotropy is strong . for bulk",
    "coo the easy axis is reported to be along the [ 117 ] directions @xcite . however , in very thin layers because of missing neighbors the easy axis has still to be determined .",
    "training effects , which have been observed for coo / co , add an additional difficulty",
    ". however , training effects can also be useful for the understanding of the metastability of interfaces , as we will show further below .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the thickness dependence of the exchange bias effect by using a wedge type coo / co(111 ) bilayer with a co thickness varying from 27    to 400   .",
    "previous studies by gruyters and riegel @xcite have shown that the shape of the hysteresis changes dramatically with the co thickness , indicating that aside from film orientation and exchange coupling the film thickness plays an important role for the type of domains formed and magnetization reversal observed . here we report extensive hysteresis measurements of coo / co(111 ) bilayers , including a detailed analysis of the interfacial domain state by investigating the specular and off - specular neutron spin flip cross section at the coercive fields for descending and ascending magnetic fields .",

    "we have studied , in addition , epitaxial co(111 ) layers , which have been thermally oxidized _ in - situ_. synchrotron diffraction studies of the in - plane coo structure showed that [ 111 ] is the surface normal of the 2.5 nm thick coo film @xcite . by analogy",
    "we assume that for the highly textured coo / co bilayer used for the present study , the same orientational relationship holds .",
    "if the interface were ideal , this orientation would provide uncompensated spins and therefore would exhibit an exchange bias effect .",

    "second the bias field is constant and about + 20  oe between 1  koe and 40  koe , but below 1  koe the bias field increases dramatically to twice its former value .",
    "this increase is solely due to a shift of @xmath22 to smaller values with decreasing cooling field , while @xmath23 remains constant .",
    "we also note that the increasing eb field correlates with a decreasing remanence at 320  k as the cooling field is lowered .",

    "this behavior can be explained assuming two contributions to the interfacial exchange coupling .",
    "normally the interface exchange coupling is ferromagnetic between coo and co as already mentioned above , being the result of a direct exchange of co monolayers on either side of the ferro- and antiferromagnetic layer@xcite . for a positive exchange bias effect we have to assume that some parts at the interface are , however , antiparallel coupled .",
    "then , an antiparallel alignment may be caused by a superexchange type of mechanism mediated by an oxygen monolayer at the interface .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that due to roughness or thickness fluctuations , small fractions of the coo film may be oxygen terminated instead of metal terminated at the interface .",
    "next we discuss the training effect in the region below the blocking temperature @xcite , which is different from the training for the positive exchange bias fig.[pextr ] . after closing a complete loop",
    "the hysteresis becomes symmetric and assumes an s - like shape .",
    "the @xmath22 field for all subsequent loops and the eb - field is smaller than for the first reversal .",
    "thus the trained hysteresis has a different shape and a smaller eb field than the hysteresis of the virgin sample .",
    "obviously the first reversal is dominated by a different process than the following reversals , transforming the sample from a unique and irreversible state to a different state with reproducible and symmetric branches of the descending and    top : the field cooling dependence of the positive exchange bias for sample s2 ( coo(25)/co(56 ) ) .",

    "this configuration of the sample allows to observe with high sensitivity the ferromagnetic domains and the spin misalignment at the interfaces@xcite .",
    "the method we used to study the magnetization reversal by pnr includes the following concepts : ( 1 ) the dependence of spin asymmetry measured at one specific value of the wave vector transfer depends only on the cosine of the angle ( @xmath38 ) between the magnetic induction in the magnetic layer and the neutron polarization direction ; ( b ) the spin - flip reflectivity is proportional to @xmath39 ; ( c ) the off - specular scattering shows the existence of magnetic domains within the magnetic layer ; ( d ) the enhancement of the neutron density achieved at the magnetic interface , using the neutron resonator , increases the off - specular scattering from the interfacial magnetic domain walls .    in order to find the optimized scattering vectors for measuring neutron hysteresis loops , we have first recorded a complete set of polarized neutron reflectivities for all four cross - sections .",

    "vice versa , the rather low spin - flip intensities , which are observed during the first magnetization reversal in the virgin state at @xmath22 are indicative of pure 180@xmath63 domain wall movement .",
    "the step like intensity change at @xmath22 = -750  oe   is followed by a steady decrease as the system approaches saturation ( see fig .",

    "the slightly enhanced specular spin - flip scattering takes place in a very narrow field range of not more than 15 oe [ fwhm=9 oe ] . from these features it is obvious that domain wall nucleation and propagation let the magnetic spins at the interface canted away from the applied field direction .",

    "if the diffuse scattering were originating from domain walls inside of the co - layer , then the off - specular scattering should vanish in saturation , which is clearly not the case here .",
    "the creation of interfacial domains is crucial for the change of the reversal character from domain wall motion at @xmath22 to domain rotation at @xmath23 .",
    "the breakdown of the ferromagnetic film in domains along the trained hysteresis has also been observed by velthuis et al .",
    "here we show that the breakdown occurs already during the very first reversal and does not heal anymore even in saturation .",

    "the pnr results lead us to the following interpretation of the magnetization reversal in an eb - field . at @xmath22",
    "the magnetization reversal takes place via nucleation and domain wall movement and leaves the interface in a ( partial ) magnetic domain state .",
    "the spins in the interfacial domains are strongly coupled to the antiferromagnet and even in saturation they are not aligned along the external field direction .",
    "those interface spins give rise to the strong off - specular diffuse spin - flip scattering . upon returning from saturation in negative fields we notice an increase of the diffuse spin flip scattering , which suggests that a torque is acting on the ferromagnetic spins trying to reverse them back to the direction of the cooling field long before the magnetization reversal actually takes place .",
    "it seems that those interfacial magnetic domains are the seeds of the second magnetization reversal at @xmath23 , which proceeds via domain rotation .",
    "the domain rotation at @xmath23 is characterized by a large specular spin - flip scattering ( panel c of fig .",
    "[ nhl1 ] ) and off - specular diffuse scattering ( not shown ) .",
    "therefore the second and all other reversals are dominated by domain rotation processes .",
    "the behavior of the interface layer as revealed by pnr is in good qualitative agreement with the observation of uncompensated spins at the coo / co interface by gruyters and riegel @xcite and with the model put forward by mauri and co - workers @xcite .",
    "the latter authors suggest the formation of a domain wall parallel to the interface during reversal of the fm orientation , which can effectively lower the interfacial energy cost of reversing the fm layer without removing the condition of strong interfacial af / f coupling . the interface may be considered as a diluted antiferromagnet .",
    "this should be distinguished from the work of miltenyi et al.@xcite , who purposely keep the defects away from the interface .",
    "it would be desirable to image the interfacial domains by real space methods such as done recently via polarized electron emission microscopy @xcite .",
    "this methods can , however , only be applied in remanence .",
    "ferromagnetic domains as they develop at the interface and in high fields can presently only be followed via polarized neutron reflectivity .",
    "in summary , using a wedge type sample with a co thickness gradient we have determined the coercive fields and the exchange bias field after field cooling for different co layer thicknesses .",
    "the exchange bias field at low temperature follows the @xmath69 behavior .",
    "in addition , the temperature dependence of the exchange bias field exhibits a small positive value just below the blocking temperature , which is most likely due to a superexchange mechanism with antiferromagnetic exchange coupling at the af / f interface . with polarized neutron reflectivity measurements",
    "we have shown that the first magnetization reversal at @xmath22 is dominated by nucleation and domain wall motion , while the second magnetization reversal at @xmath23 can be described by magnetization rotation .",
    "all subsequent reversals are similar to the second , yielding a symmetric hysteresis , which , however , remains shifted .",
    "furthermore diffuse spin - flip scattering reveals the formation of magnetic domains at the interface , induced by the first magnetization reversal .",
    "we have shown that these magnetic domains are preserved even in saturation and that they serve as seeds for the second magnetization reversal .",
    "overall , our data reveal clear differences between the coercive fields of the very first reversal @xmath22 and the second reversal at @xmath23",
    ". the mechanisms of the magnetization reversal ( domain wall motion versus domain rotation ) and their temperature dependencies are clearly distinct .",
    "for the sake of clarity we shall demonstrate the formulae [ sa2 ] and [ sf1 ] for a simple case .",
    "let us consider a semi - infinite magnetic media for which we shall obtain the analytical formulae of reflectivities .",
    "we start from the general formalism presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . using the expression @xmath70 and",
    "the well known properties of the pauli operator @xmath71 one can write the expression of the wave vector operator as : @xmath72 where @xmath73 are the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath74 and @xmath75 is a unit vector which defines the direction of the magnetic induction in the @xmath76 media , @xmath77 is the nuclear scattering length density of the i - the layer , where @xmath78 is the nuclear density and @xmath79 is the coherent scattering length.the matrix representation of @xmath80 reads :    @xmath81 where @xmath38 and @xmath19 are the polar and the axial angle in the spherical coordinates with the polar axis being the quantization axis . choosing the quantization axis to be parallel to the polarization axis , the matrix representation of the reflection operator @xmath82 becomes : @xmath83 with : @xmath84          it is easy to check that the expressions above are the same as ones obtained by pleshanov  @xcite . in order to understand how the reflectivities depend on the magnetization reversal in an ferromagnetic media",
    "let us consider the case when @xmath88 .",
    "choosing just a single value for the incident wave vector and sweeping the applied magnetic field is a key ingredient for measuring a complete hysteresis loop via pnr .",
    "we neglect the neutron absorption into the sample and consider the case when the applied magnetic field is much smaller then the internal fields into the ferromagnetic media . with these assumptions and for @xmath89 the reflectivities become:@xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the ratio of the magnetic to the nuclear potential .",
    "the conclusion from the formulae above are that at the critical scattering vector for non - polarized neutron , the reflectivities : + - depend on the absolute value of the magnetization induction ; + - depend on the relative orientation between the polarization axis and the direction of the magnetic induction into the media ; + -do not depend on the polar angle @xmath19 .",
    "+ we consider below two cases : one when the magnetization reversal proceeds by rotation and another case where the magnetization changes through domain wall movement .",
    "let us consider that the magnetic moments will rotate during the magnetization reversal in such a way that @xmath94 with the components @xmath95 and @xmath96 . the easiest way to imagine such a rotation is to rotate the sample instead of rotating the magnetic moment , keeping the remanent magnetization equal to the saturation magnetization ( @xmath97 )",
    ". with this assumption the spin asymmetry @xmath98 becomes:@xmath99 @xmath100    the spin flip reflectivity is:@xmath101 @xmath102 measurements of @xmath103 and @xmath104 at any @xmath54 value as a function of the applied magnetic field provide the same hysteresis loop as obtained by moke or squid measurements .",
    "moreover , fitting the non - spin flip reflectivity curves taken in saturation ( r@xmath105 or r@xmath106 or both ) one can accurately evaluate the absolute magnetic moment . in comparison , for moke one would have to make a calibration for the kerr angles and for squid one needs to determine the volume of the magnetic layer .",
    "now we discuss a magnetization reversal by domain wall movement . for simplicity",
    "we consider a situation where a magnetic film consists of ferromagnetic domains with the following configuration : a fraction of @xmath107 domains have their spins oriented parallel to the neutron polarization and a fraction of @xmath108 domains have the spin oriented antiparallel .",
    "the measured reflectivities would not be simply @xmath103 or @xmath104 but given by @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the measured spin asymmetry becomes :    @xmath111 where @xmath112 with @xmath113 being the magnetic induction into the magnetic domains .",
    "thus , the shape of the hysteresis loop is completely defined .",
    "the spin flip scattering will result only from domain walls .    in a more general case",
    "when for instance the magnetic domains are rotated with respect to the neutron polarization axis , there will also be spin flip scattering .",
    "for this case the sa expression will still be valid and , in addition , from the spin - flip scattering their angle relative to the neutron polarization axis can be measured .",
    "we mention that the formulae above are only correct in the absence of off - specular scattering .",
    "the values of sa and the spin - flip reflectivity will be affected by the loss of the specular signal .",
    "this can be seen when comparing squid or moke based magnetic hysteresis loops to the one extracted from the sa .",
    "regions where the loops do not overlap indicate the presence of magnetic domains . this can be clearly seen in fig . [ nhl1](a ) .",
    "a different approach for evaluating the average magnetization vectors inside of a film in a domain state was taken by lee et al .",
    "@xcite . instead of measuring the magnetization reversal at one specific wave vector ,",
    "complete reflectivity curves are recorded and the average magnetization as well as the mean square dispersion of the domains as function of @xmath54 is evaluated .",
    "they use similar reflectivity formulae as shown above , but do not derive magnetization loops . for a quantitative comparison of hysteresis loops",
    "the method presented here is faster and more effective .",
