    "in this paper we study oscillating flows of a viscous incompressible fluid between two solid walls produced by the transverse vibrations of the walls .",
    "it is well - known that high - frequency oscillations of the boundary of a domain occupied by a viscous fluid generate not only an oscillating flow but also a ( relatively ) weak steady flow , which is usually called the steady streaming ( see , e.g. , the review papers @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "recently such flows attracted considerable attention in the context of application of steady streaming to micro - mixing @xcite and to drag reduction in channel flows @xcite .",
    "the basic parameters of the problem are the inverse strouhal number @xmath0 and the streaming reynolds number @xmath1 , defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the amplitude of the velocity of the oscillating walls , @xmath4 is the mean distance between the walls , @xmath5 is the angular frequency of the vibrations and @xmath6 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid .",
    "parameter @xmath0 measures the ratio of the amplitude of the displacement of the vibrating wall to the mean distance between the walls and is assumed to be small : @xmath7 .",
    "note that the relation between the standard reynolds number @xmath8 based on @xmath3 and @xmath4 and the streaming reynolds number @xmath1 is given by @xmath9 , so that @xmath10 corresponds to @xmath11 when @xmath12 is small .",
    "the present paper deals with the flow regimes with @xmath10 .",
    "this implies that the amplitude of the wall displacement is of the same order of magnitude as the thickness of the stokes layer .",
    "steady streaming at @xmath10 ( and even for large @xmath13 ) induced by translational oscillations of a rigid body in a viscous fluid had been studied by many authors ( see @xcite ) . in the case of a body in an infinite fluid , the problem can be reduced to an equivalent problem about a fixed body placed in an oscillating flow , which considerably simplifies the analysis . a related problem of steady streaming and mass transport produced by",
    "water waves had been treated in @xcite ) where flow regimes with large @xmath13 were considered .",
    "previous studies of flows produced by transverse oscillations of solid walls had been mostly focused on the problem of peristaltic pumping in channels and pipes under the assumption of low reynolds numbers ( @xmath14 ) and small amplitude - to - wavelength ratio ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although there are a few paper where the case of large reynolds numbers ( @xmath11 ) had been considered @xcite , these studies still correspond to @xmath15 .",
    "as far as we know , the flow regimes with @xmath10 have not been treated before .",
    "the aim of this paper is to construct an asymptotic expansion of the solution of the navier - stokes equation in the limit @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the procedure includes the derivation of the equations and boundary conditions for a steady component of the flow ( steady streaming ) that persists everywhere except thin layers near the vibrating walls ( whose thickness is of the same order as the amplitude of vibrations ) .",
    "since the thickness of the stokes layer @xmath18 and the amplitude of the displacements of the walls @xmath19 are of the same order of magnitude , the boundary conditions on the moving walls can not be transferred to the fixed mean positions of the walls .",
    "this is what makes the problem difficult .    to obtain an asymptotic expansion",
    ", we employ the vishik - lyusternik method ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) rather than the standard method of matched asymptotic expansions . in comparison with the latter , the vishik - lyusternik method does not require the procedure of matching the inner and outer expansions and the boundary layer part of the expansion satisfies the condition of decay at infinity ( in boundary layer variable ) in all orders of the expansion ( this is not so in the method of matched asymptotic expansions where the boundary layer part usually does not decay and may even grow at infinity ) .",
    "the vishik - lyusternik method had been used to study viscous boundary layers at a fixed impermeable boundary by chudov @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been applied to viscous boundary layers in high reynolds number flows through a fixed domain with an inlet and an outlet @xcite , to viscous flows in a half - plane produced by tangential vibrations on its boundary @xcite and to the steady streaming between two cylinders @xcite .",
    "a similar technique had been used in @xcite to construct an asymptotic expansion in a problem of vibrational convection .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2 , we formulate the mathematical problem . in section 3 , the asymptotic equations and boundary conditions are derived .",
    "section 4 outlines the construction of the asymptotic solution . in section 5 ,",
    "we consider examples of the steady streaming induced by vibrations of the walls in the form of standing or travelling waves .",
    "finally , discussion of results and conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
    "we consider a three - dimensional viscous incompressible flow between two parallel walls produced by normal , periodic ( in time ) vibrations of the walls .",
    "let @xmath20 be the cartesian coordinates , @xmath21 the time , @xmath22 the velocity of the fluid , @xmath23 the pressure , @xmath24 the fluid density , @xmath6 the kinematic viscosity and @xmath4 the mean distance between the walls .",
    "we introduce the non - dimensional quantities @xmath25 where @xmath5 and @xmath19 are the angular frequency and the amplitude of the vibrations . in these variables ,",
    "the navier - stokes equations take the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 parameter @xmath12 is the ratio of the amplitude of vibrations to the mean distance between the walls , @xmath28 where @xmath1 is the reynolds number based on the amplitudes of the velocity and the normal displacement of the vibrating boundary ( the streaming reynolds number ) .",
    "the walls are described by the equations @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are given functions that are @xmath32-periodic in @xmath33 and have zero mean value , i.e. @xmath34 we also assume that @xmath30 and @xmath31 are periodic both in @xmath35 and in @xmath36 with periods @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "boundary conditions for the velocity at the walls are the standard no - slip conditions : @xmath39 the incompressibility of the fluid implies that functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 must satisfy an additional condition which , in the periodic case , is given by @xmath42 the non - dimensional equations and boundary conditions depend only on two parameters @xmath12 and @xmath43 . in what follows we are interested in the asymptotic behaviour of periodic solutions of eqs .",

    ", we consider the situation where the amplitude of the vibration is small and of the same order as the thickness of the stokes layer .",
    "it is convenient to separate vertical and horizontal components of the velocity as follows : @xmath45 i.e. @xmath46 is the projection of the velocity onto the horizontal plane ( the @xmath47 plane ) .",
    "we will also use the notation : @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    "we assume that the boundary layer parts of the expansion rapidly decay outside thin boundary layers , namely : @xmath60 for every @xmath61 .",

    "we have considered incompressible flows between two transversely vibrating solid walls and proposed a general procedure for constructing an asymptotic expansion of solutions of the navier - stokes equations in the limit when both the amplitude of vibrations and the thickness of the stokes layer are small and have the same order of magnitude .",
    "the procedure is based on the vishik - lyusternik method and , in principle , can be used to construct as many terms of the expansion as necessary . in the leading order ,",
    "the averaged flow is described by the stationary navier - stokes equations with an additional term which contains the leading - order stokes drift velocity . in a slightly different context ( for a flow induced by an oscillating conservative body force ) , the same equations had been derived earlier by riley @xcite .",
    "0.2 cm the general theory has been applied to two particular examples of steady streaming induced by vibrations of the walls in the form of standing and travelling plane waves . in the case of plane standing waves ( bending or contraction / expansion waves ) , the averaged flow has the form of a double array of vortices ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] ) . for short waves",
    "the vortices are concentrated near the walls , while long waves produce vortices that fill the entire channel .",
    "the latter pattern is similar to flows produced by long standing waves at small reynolds numbers @xcite . for both bending and contraction / expansion waves , the flow patterns are qualitatively the same .",
    "however , the intensity of the averaged flow is different .",
    "although it is of similar magnitude for both waves when the wavelength is small , for long waves , the maximum velocity decreases much faster for bending waves than for contraction / expansion waves , which is in agreement with the classical theory of peristaltic pumping at low reynolds numbers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "0.2 cm if vibrations of the wall have the form of plane harmonic waves which travel in the same direction ( this leads to a bending wave if the phase shift between these travelling waves is zero , and to a contraction / expansion wave if the phase shift is @xmath305 ) , the induced steady flow is a unidirectional two - dimensional flow .",
    "the fortunate thing is that , in this case , the asymptotic equations can be solved analytically .",
    "the lagrangian velocity profile is symmetric relative to the channel central axis , with a minimum velocity at the centre and maxima at the walls . in the short wave limit , the lagrangian velocity profiles for both bending and contraction / expansion waves are the same : the velocity is nearly constant across the channel except for narrow layers near the walls where velocity is much higher . for moderate and long waves ,",
    "the velocity variation across the channel is much smaller , and the magnitude of the velocity rapidly grows for the contraction / expansion wave and decays for the bending wave when the wavelength increases .",
    "this example may be viewed as an extension of the theory of peristaltic pumping to the case of high reynolds numbers .",
    "0.2 cm if vibrations of the walls have the form of plane harmonic waves traveling in opposite directions , the averaged flow depends on the wavelength in a more complicated way . for short waves",
    "the averaged flow is a superposition of a shear flow with a linear velocity profile and a periodic array of weak vortices ( ` cat s eyes ' ) in the center of the channel . when the wavelength increases , the vortices first grow in size and magnitude .",
    "then each of them splits into a pair of vortices of the same sign , and at the same time new vortices appear near the walls and move towards the centre of the channel . eventually , for long waves , there are two arrays of alternating vortices ( similar to what we had in the case of standing waves )",
    ".    0.2 cm as an example of general periodic vibrations , we have considered travelling contraction / expansion and bending waves of an arbitrary shape .",
    "similarly to the case of a harmonic vibration , these produce unidirectional two - dimensional flows .",
    "the averaged lagrangian velocity is written as an infinite series in term of fourier coefficients of the deformations of the walls .",
    "the natural question that appears here is : what deformations of the walls lead to a maximum total volume flux through the channel .",
    "it turns out that the optimal shape always corresponds to a single harmonic . for a contraction / expansion wave ,",
    "it is always the first harmonic ( with @xmath306 ) . for a bending wave , the optimal harmonic",
    "is uniquely determined by the parameter @xmath243 .",
    "for example , if @xmath84 , then @xmath307 .",
    "it should be noted here that a contraction / expansion wave always produces a higher total volume flux then a bending wave .",
    "0.2 cm there are many open problems in this area .",
    "first , it is not quite clear how the present theory can be extended to the case of high @xmath1 .",
    "second , we did not make any assumption about the characteristic length scale of vibrations in the horizontal direction .",
    "nevertheless , the examples show that the theory does not work when the horizontal length scale is much smaller than the mean distance between the walls .",
    "in particular , figures 2 and 5 shows that for @xmath308 the flows in examples 1 and 2 become concentrated near the walls .",
    "this suggests that in the limit of short waves , one can try to construct a theory with double boundary layers ( similar to what had been done by stuart @xcite and riley @xcite for an oscillating cylinder at @xmath309 ) .",
    "third , it would be interesting to investigate the effect of an external mean flow ( e.g. , a flow produced by a mean pressure gradient ) on the steady steaming between two walls and vice versa .",
    "this problem has an additional parameter - the ratio of the characteristic velocity of the mean flow to the amplitude of the velocity of the vibrating walls and , therefore , one can expect a variety of different flow regimes .",
