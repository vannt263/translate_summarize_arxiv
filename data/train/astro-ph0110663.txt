    "according to mateo et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and to da costa et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , sextans is dominated by a very old population , with a red horizontal branch ( hb ) and several blue straggler stars ( bss ) .",
    "they found [ fe / h]@xmath01.6/@xmath11.7 for this population , in disagreement with the correlation between [ fe / h ] and _ m_@xmath2 followed by the other dwarf spheroidals .",
    "suntzeff et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , geysler & sarajedini ( 1996 ) , shetrone et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , found a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath02.0/@xmath11.6 , with an intrinsic spread of @xmath30.19 _ dex_. the mean [ fe / h]@xmath02.0 is in good agreement with the [ fe / h ] vs. _ m_@xmath2 relation .    a variable stars survey ( mateo et al . 1995 )",
    "confirm the presence of a very old dominant population , but argue that the bsss trace a younger population , comprising @xmath325@xmath4 of the whole stellar content .",
    "all data have been taken with the wide field imager ( wfi ) at the 2.2 _ m _ eso - mpi telescope , a mosaic ccd camera with a total field of view of @xmath334@xmath533@xmath6 .",
    "two 600 _ sec _ exposures have been obtained in the _ b _ and _ i _ bands in january 1999 .",
    "the observing run , observational set - up and photometric calibration are the same as in pancino et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "one 300 _ sec _ exposure in the _ v _ band has been retrieved from the wfi archive .",
    "the absolute calibration of the _ v _ band was obtained by using the stars in common with mateo et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "all data have been processed with iraf and the photometry has been performed with dophot ( schechter , mateo & saha 1993 ) .",
    "as shown in figure  1 above , an extended blue hb can be observed for the first time .",
    "the blue hb is kinked over the instability strip , strongly resembling the color - magnitude diagram observed for sculptor by majewski et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "they interpreted the sculptor hb morphology as the signature of the presence of two distinct stellar populations , one with [ fe / h]@xmath02.0 and the other one with [ fe / h]@xmath01.5 .",
    "the rgb ridge lines of three template globular clusters from ferraro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have been overplotted on both the sextans and the sculptor cmd in figure  1 ( _ right panels _ ) . from the bluest to the reddest they are :    * ngc  5053 , [ fe / h]@xmath02.51 * ngc  4590 ( m68 ) , [ fe / h]@xmath01.99 * ngc  5727 ( m3 ) , [ fe / h]@xmath01.34    from this simple comparison , we can notice that the rgb is broad , that the majority of stars lies on the blue side of the m3 ridge line and that only @xmath325@xmath4 of the stars lie between the mean ridge lines of m68 and ngc  5053 .",
    "figure  1 suggests us that two separate populations with different metallicities can be present in the sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "let us investigate further .",
    "if we take now the most `` vertical '' section of the rgb and produce a histogram of the color distribution , we see a clear bimodality ( see figure  2 , _ left panels _ and _ right top panel _ ) .    from all of the above evidence , we can conclude that :    * [ fe / h]@xmath71.6 is at most an upper limit for the stars in sextans * the majority of stars in sextans has a mean [ fe / h]@xmath01.8 * only @xmath325@xmath4 of the stars in sextans seem to have a lower [ fe / h]@xmath82.1 .",
    "this fraction is compatible with the fraction of stars in the blue hb ( @xmath317@xmath4 )",
    "as a last piece of evidence , we plotted the luminosity function for the sextans rgb ( figure  2 , _ right bottom panel _ ) , following the standard approach as in fusi pecci et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and we identified a double rgb bump .",
    "the luminosity of the rgb bump is known to depend primarily on the metal content , and only weekly on age : more metal deficient stellar populations have brighter bumps .",
    "hence the double bump can be interpreted as another signature of two different populations with different metallicity .",
