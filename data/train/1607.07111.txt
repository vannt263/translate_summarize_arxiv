    "atomic nuclei reveal spontaneous breaking of the rotational symmetry in both real space and gauge space in stepping away from the magic numbers .",
    "most of the deformed nuclei still keep the axial symmetry . in axially deformed nuclei , a low - frequency quadrupole mode of excitation , known as the @xmath0 vibration  @xcite , emerges .",
    "the @xmath0 vibrational mode of excitation is regarded as a precursory soft mode of the permanent non - axial deformation  @xcite .    in actual nuclei ,",
    "the onset of @xmath0 instability is expected to occur in the transitional regions where the nucleus is weakly deformed  @xcite .",
    "for example , a schematic hamiltonian with the pairing - plus - quadrupole residual interactions predicted an occurrence of the triaxial deformation with an axial - deformation parameter @xmath5 in the os ( @xmath6 ) and pt ( @xmath7 ) isotopes around @xmath8 , and the lowering of the second @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) state in the region of @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "regardless of the nature of axial asymmetry , being either @xmath0 vibration , @xmath0 softness ( instability ) , or permanent triaxial deformation , in deformed even - even nuclei the energy of the @xmath10 state , on which a characteristic @xmath12 @xmath0 band is built , decreases as the non - axial collectivity is enhanced  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath10 states were observed at low excitation energy ( @xmath13 800 kev ) for the dy ( @xmath14 ) and er ( @xmath15 ) isotopes with @xmath16  @xcite . in such well - deformed , axially - symmetric nuclei ,",
    "the energies of the low - spin members of the @xmath0-vibrational band obey reasonably well the regularity that is expected from the standard rotor picture . on the other hand , some nuclei tend to represent a staggering in energies of the even- and odd - spin levels within a @xmath0 band .",
    "the pattern of the even - odd staggering is expected to be opposite for @xmath0-unstable and @xmath0-rigid rotors  @xcite . for pt isotopes ,",
    "the property of the @xmath0 band in @xmath17pt ( @xmath1 ) is close to the @xmath0-unstable case , while the other isotopes , in particular around @xmath18 , exhibit behaviors that fall between the two extremes  @xcite . although it is not simple to distinguish the @xmath0 softness and the rigid triaxial deformation in terms of the staggering in @xmath0-band energies even for os isotopes , which are supposed to be the typical @xmath0-soft nuclei  @xcite , the fact that the @xmath10 state is lower in energy than the @xmath19 level of the ground - state rotational band in @xmath20os ( @xmath18 ) is indicative of strongly enhanced axial asymmetry .",
    "the @xmath18 isotones , @xmath20os and @xmath21w ( @xmath22 ) , the latter having the lowest @xmath10 energy ( 454 kev ) in this region  @xcite , reveal isomeric - decay transitions with anomalously low @xmath23 hindrances  @xcite , indicating that @xmath23 is no longer a good quantum number due to substantial axial asymmetry .",
    "neutron - rich dy isotopes around double midshell were produced by in - flight fission of a @xmath24u beam at the ri - beam factory ( ribf ) at riken , and their level structures were studied using the eurica setup . isomers with @xmath25 and @xmath26 were identified in @xmath27dy ( @xmath28 )  @xcite and @xmath29dy ( @xmath1 )  @xcite , respectively , both of which decay to the respective ground - state and @xmath0 bands . despite the robust nature of the ground - state rotational band and the @xmath23 isomer , being characteristic of an axially deformed nucleus , @xmath29dy has the @xmath0 band at unusually low excitation energy compared to the nearby well - deformed nuclei  @xcite .",
    "this spectroscopic result suggests that the shell structure near the fermi surface plays crucial roles in developing the collectivity in this doubly mid - shell region .",
    "the vibrational mode of excitation is described microscopically by the random phase approximation ( rpa ) on top of the mean - field ground state  @xcite . since the ground state is deformed and in the superfluid phase , the deformed quasiparticle - rpa ( qrpa )",
    "is commonly employed to study the @xmath0 vibration  @xcite .",

    "@xcite found that the skm * functional  @xcite reproduces well the trends in energies and transition probabilities in the light rare - earth nuclei , although the numerical results obtained by the qrpa are not perfect .    in this article , we investigate systematically the microscopic structure of the @xmath0 vibration in the neutron - rich dy isotopes with @xmath2 in a skyrme edf approach .",

    "since the parity ( @xmath33 ) and the magnetic quantum number ( @xmath46 ) are good quantum numbers , the hfb hamiltonian becomes in a block diagonal form with respect to each @xmath62 sector .",
    "the hfb equations for each sector are solved independently with 64 cores for the qp states up to @xmath63 with positive and negative parities .",

    "we introduce an additional truncation for the qrpa calculation , in terms of the 2qp energy as @xmath65 mev .",
