    "<S> the present status of the ( jr ) dynamical parton distribution functions is reported . </S>",
    "<S> different theoretical improvements , including the determination of the strange sea input distribution , the treatment of correlated errors and the inclusion of alternative data sets , are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> highlights in the ongoing developments as well as ( very ) preliminary results in the determination of the strong coupling constant are presented .    </S>",
    "<S> the _ dynamical _ parton distributions of the nucleon at @xmath0  gev@xmath1 are qcd radiatively generated from _ </S>",
    "<S> valencelike _ for _ all _ input distributions @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , not only the valence but also the sea and gluon input densities vanish at small @xmath3 . ] positive definite input distributions at an optimally determined low input scale @xmath4  gev@xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> . thus the _ steep _ small - bjorken-@xmath3 behavior of structure functions , and consequently of the gluon and sea distributions , appears within the dynamical ( radiative ) approach mainly as a consequence of qcd - dynamics at @xmath5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , in the common `` standard '' approach the input scale is fixed at some arbitrarily chosen @xmath6  gev@xmath1 , and the corresponding input distributions are less restricted ; for example , the mentioned _ steep _ small-@xmath3 behavior has to be _ </S>",
    "<S> fitted_.    following the radiative approach , the well - known lo / nlo grv98 dynamical parton distribution functions of @xcite have been updated in @xcite , and the analysis extended to the nnlo of perturbative qcd in @xcite . in addition , in @xcite a series of `` standard '' fits were produced in ( for the rest ) exactly the same conditions as their dynamical counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to compare the features of both approaches and to test the the dependence in model assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> the associated uncertainties encountered in the determination of the parton distributions turn out , as expected , to be larger in the `` standard '' case , particularly in the small-@xmath3 region , than in the more restricted dynamical radiative approach where , moreover , the `` evolution distance '' ( starting at @xmath4  gev@xmath1 ) is sizably larger @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the strong coupling constant @xmath7 was determined in our analyses together with the parton distributions , in particular it is closely related to the gluon distribution which drives the qcd evolution and consequently its uncertainty is also smaller in the dynamical case . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained @xmath8 0.1124 @xmath9 0.0020 at nnlo , and 0.1145 @xmath9 0.0018 at nlo in the dynamical case ; to be compared with @xmath8 0.1158 @xmath9 0.0035 at nnlo , and 0.1178 @xmath9 0.0021 at nlo in the `` standard '' one . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between these values is to be interpreted as a genuine uncertainty stemming from parameterization dependence , e.g. our contribution to the next pdg determination will be an average over nnlo dynamical and standard results . </S>",
    "<S> we consider this approach to be more realistic than considering only the reduced errors stemming exclusively from experimental uncertainties in each single analysis @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical predictions for @xmath10 become perturbatively stable already at @xmath11 - 3  gev@xmath1 , where precision measurements could even delineate nnlo effects in the very small-@xmath3 region . </S>",
    "<S> moreover they are positive and in excellent agreement with the latest h1 data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the results based in the common `` standard '' approach , which are less precise and in some cases turn negative at the lower @xmath12 values .    </S>",
    "<S> the inclusive production cross sections for @xmath13 and @xmath14-bosons form important benchmarks for the physics at hadron colliders . </S>",
    "<S> our nlo @xcite and nnlo @xcite predictions for these standard candles processes were presented not long ago , and a detailed comparison of the predictions predictions based on the available nnlo parton parameterizations was performed in @xcite . according to these studies the rates for gauge boson production at the lhc can be predicted with an accuracy of better than about 10% at nnlo . </S>",
    "<S> nnlo predictions for the higgs boson production cross sections for tevatron and lhc energies were also considered ; the production rates could be predicted with an accuracy of about 1020% at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of the nnlo contributions is mandatory for achieving such accuracies since the total uncertainties are substantially larger at nlo .    during the time passed since the last determination of our pdfs </S>",
    "<S> there have been experimental and theoretical developments which deserve consideration . from the experimental side , besides results coming from lhc which we will not discuss here , the combined hera data on neutral current and charge current dis has been published @xcite ; the combination of the charm production data is ready but unfortunately still not publicly available . for the older fixed - target data in our analyses we use now directly the measured cross - sections ( instead of the extracted structure functions ) since </S>",
    "<S> potential problems with some of these extractions have been pointed out @xcite . a wealth of deuteron data </S>",
    "<S> have also been included , for which description we use the nuclear corrections of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further theoretical improvements include the use of the running mass definition for dis charm and bottom production @xcite .    in this proceeding we will concentrate in several concrete aspects of the ongoing update , modifications in the ansatz for the strangeness input distributions , and some consequences of the treatment of correlated systematic errors , in particular of the normalization uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> some preliminary results on determinations of @xmath7 and the ( future ) inclusion of higher - twist terms in our analyses are also briefly discussed .     </S>",
    "<S> gev@xmath1 obtained using @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the original jr09 @xcite were obtained using @xmath16 and are also shown for comparison.,scaledwidth=72.0% ]    as in previous dynamical determinations @xcite , since the data sets used are insensitive to the specific choice of the strange quark distributions , the strange densities of the _ dynamical _ distributions in @xcite have been generated entirely radiatively starting from vanishing strange input distributions : @xmath17 at the _ low _ input scale gev@xmath1 , the strange input distributions were chosen @xmath15 , as is conventional @xcite . ] . </S>",
    "<S> the plausibility of these _ assumptions _ was investigated in @xcite by confronting the predictions derived from dynamical distributions determined in this way with the most precise dimuon production data @xcite , which were the most sensitive to the strangeness content of the nucleon until the recent atlas measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a good agreement was found at nlo . since the nnlo corrections ( thus the experimental acceptance corrections ) for these process are not known , </S>",
    "<S> a consistent study of these data at nnlo is not possible . </S>",
    "<S> however it is apparent that unless the nnlo corrections were very large ( which seems unlikely ) our jr09 nnlo distributions would generally undershoot the data . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the would - be nnlo results favor @xmath18 at the input scale . in order to estimate the implications which this could have for our predictions for benchmark processes at the lhc </S>",
    "<S> we have repeated our jr09 dynamical analysis using @xmath15 as in our `` standard '' fits . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting input distributions are compared with the original jr09 input in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sinput ] . </S>",
    "<S> it can be observed that the increase in the strange distributions is _ compensated _ by a decrease in the light sea , while the other distributions remain practically unaltered . </S>",
    "<S> the mentioned benchmark cross - sections for @xmath19 and @xmath20 production are practically identical in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the determinations of strange input distributions will have to be revisited in light of the mentioned atlas measurements @xcite , which seem to imply a greater strange content of the nucleon .    </S>",
    "<S> another aspect of our analyses in which we have been working is a more complete treatment of the correlated systematic uncertainties of the data . </S>",
    "<S> the least - squares estimator that we use to take them into account has been explicitly written down in appendix b of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is used as well for normalization uncertainties , and implies that data and theory are relatively shifted by amounts which are determined by the minimization but not restricted further . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the treatment that we used in our ( g)jr analyses , where the normalization shifts were limited by the experimental normalization uncertainties , and has resulted in small shifts on the valence distributions in the medium @xmath3 region .    </S>",
    "<S> yet another issue raised by the abm collaboration is the necessity of including higher twist for the description of fixed target data @xcite ; even if moderate kinematic cuts are used to select the data included in the fits ; in particular for slac and nmc data . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematic cuts in our g(jr ) analyses were @xmath21 gev@xmath1 and @xmath22 gev@xmath1 , and were applied to the @xmath23 values extracted from different beam energies and combined . </S>",
    "<S> the description was good for nmc data and rather poor for slac data . </S>",
    "<S> however since the number of points for these experiments was rather small ( about 100 data points for nmc and 50 for slac ) , the values of the cuts did not affect very much the results of the fits .    </S>",
    "<S> this picture changes if , as the abm collaboration does , data on the cross sections for individual energies are used , which amounts to hundreds of data points for each experiment . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned in the introduction , we also use these data in our current preliminary analyses , for which the virtuality cut has been raised to @xmath24 gev@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find results which are rather similar to our jr09 analyses , with @xmath7 values about 0.113 to 0.114 , depending on the input scale . </S>",
    "<S> if the usual cut of @xmath21 gev@xmath1 is applied to these data @xmath7 raises to 0.1176 ; a tendency in agreement with the abm observations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of higher twist terms in the theoretical description should strongly reduce the dependence of the outcome of the fits and is currently under consideration .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have discussed several aspects of the ongoing update of the jr dynamical parton distributions , in particular the determination of strangeness input distributions , the treatment of normalizations , and results on @xmath7 and their dependence on kinematic cuts and the treatment of higher - twist contributions . </S>",
    "<S> changes in the parton distributions induced by all this modifications in the analysis and in the data have been , until now , quite modest . </S>"
