    "classical cepheid variables are of great importance in astrophysics .",
    "they obey the famous period - luminosity relation ( leavitt 1908 ) , now also named the `` leavitt law '' , which has made them excellent standard candles to calibrate the first rungs of the extragalactic distance scale in the local universe ( e.g. gieren et al .",

    "cepheids are also excellent tools to check on the validity , and improve stellar pulsation and stellar evolution theories ( caputo et al . 2005 ) .",
    "one of the serious and long - standing problems of these theories was an inconsistency , at a level of @xmath6 , between the masses predicted by the evolutionary and pulsational routes ( stobie 1969 ; cox 1980 ; keller 2008 ; neilson et al .",
    "2011 and references therein ) . the obvious way to solve this `` mass discrepancy problem '' was to find cepheid variables in double - lined eclipsing binary systems which would allow to accurately determine their dynamical masses .",
    "however , it took more than 40 years until such a system ( ogle - lmc - cep-0227 ) was finally found by soszyski et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and subsequently studied by our group , yielding the dynamical mass of the cepheid with an exquisite accuracy of 1% ( pietrzynski et al . 2010 ; pilecki et al .",
    "this dynamical mass determination has already led to improvements in stellar evolution ( cassisi and salaris 2011 , neilson et al .",
    "2011 , prada moroni et al .",
    "2012 , neilson and langer 2012 ) , and stellar pulsation theories ( marconi et al . 2013 ) .    the detection of a cepheid in a double - lined eclipsing system not only allows to determine its mass with excellent accuracy , but also allows to measure highly accurate values of other physical parameters which are impossible to determine , with a similar accuracy , for a single cepheid , or a cepheid in a non - eclipsing binary system .",
    "our previous work has shown that radii accurate to 1 - 3% can be obtained , depending on the configuration of the system components at the primary and secondary eclipses ( pilecki et al .",
    "2013 , 2015 ) .",
    "such an accurate radius determination poses a strong constraint on the pulsation mode of the cepheid .",
    "the orbital and photometric solutions also allow to determine the p - factor of the cepheid which is needed in baade - wesselink ( bw)-type distance determinations of cepheids to convert their measured radial velocities to the pulsational velocities of the cepheid surfaces , and currently constitutes the largest source of systematic uncertainty in any type of bw analyses ( storm et al .",

    "a range of pulsation periods will be of enormous value in the effort to achieve distance determinations accurate to 1 - 3% for single cepheids with the bw method .",
    "apart from the p - factor , the full analysis of a cepheid - containing eclipsing binary , including the analysis of high - quality nir data , is also able to provide a precise estimation of the limb darkening of the cepheid ( see pilecki et al .",
    "2013 ; hereafter p13 ) , which can not be determined empirically in any other way .    the object of this study ,",
    "ogle lmc562.05.9009 , was discovered as an eclipsing binary with a cepheid component from ogle iv data by soszyski et al .",

    "no orbital period for the system could be derived from these data however .",

    "( 2012 ) of eclipses , we initiated extensive high - resolution spectroscopy and follow - up photometry of the lmc562.05.9009 system ( see section 2 of this paper ) , which led to the spectroscopic confirmation of its genuine binary nature , and eventually allowed an accurate determination of its orbital period . with the photometric data , and an extensive catalog of radial velocity observations of the system",
    ", we were able to precisely disentangle the pulsational and orbital radial velocity variations , and provide full and accurate orbital and photometric solutions of the system , following the methodology which was used by p13 in the analysis of the ogle - lmc - cep-0227 system .",
    "this results in the determination of accurate physical parameters for both the cepheid and its non - pulsating binary companion .",
    "future near - infrared photometric coverage of the next eclipses , which will occur in about four years from now , will improve on the characterization of the physical parameters of the two stars .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the data underlying this study . in secion 3",
    ", we will present the data analysis methods , and the results emerging from our analysis of the observational data . in section 4 ,",
    "conclusions and an outlook on future work will be presented .",
    "in order to reliably and accurately separate the orbital motion from the radial velocity variations due to the pulsation of the cepheid component in the system , a large number of precise radial velocity measurements , providing good phase coverage of both the pulsational , and orbital radial velocity curves , was necessary .",
    "this task was not made easier by the close - to - integer value of 2.988 days of the pulsation period of the cepheid .",
    "we obtained high - resolution echelle spectra using the uves spectrograph at the eso - vlt on paranal ( 49 epochs ) , the mike spectrograph at the 6.5-m magellan clay telescope at las campanas observatory ( 22 epochs ) , and the harps spectrograph at the 3.6-m telescope at eso - la silla ( 10 epochs ) .",
    "the uves data were reduced using a standard eso pipeline and software obtained from the eso webpage ( http://www.eso.org/sci/software.html ) ( freudling et al .",
    "the mike data were reduced with the pipeline software written by dan kelson , following the approach outlined in kelson ( 2003 ) .",

    "( 2005 ) were used as templates .",
    "the typical formal errors of the derived velocities are @xmath8 m / s .",
    "the individual radial velocity measurements for both components of the ogle lmc562.05.9009 system are available online at :    http://araucaria.astrouw.edu.pl/p/cep9009    in some cases where line profiles of both companions were blended , only the velocity of the cepheid ( number 1 in the table ) was measured . by fitting the systemic radial velocities with the datasets from the different instruments , we found offsets of + 250 m / s for mike , and -210 m / s for harps , respectively with respect to the uves radial velocity system .",
    "these small offsets have been taken into account . even if we would not have corrected for these very small velocity shifts between the different instruments , the orbital solution and the physical parameters of the component stars derived in the following sections would not have changed in any significant way .",
    "a total of 588 photometric measurements in the @xmath9-band and 143 in the @xmath10-band were collected with the warsaw telescope by the ogle project ( udalski et al .",
    "2015 ) , and during observing time granted to the araucaria project by the chilean national time allocation committee ( cntac ) .",
    "the images were reduced with the ogle standard photometric pipeline based on difference image analysis , dia ( udalski et al .",
    "2015 ) , and instrumental magnitudes were calibrated onto the standard system using landolt standards .",
    "the typical accuracy of the measurements was at the 5 mmag level .",
    "we have also used instrumental @xmath10-band and @xmath11-band data from the macho project ( i d : 71.11933.15 ) downloaded from the webpage http://macho.anu.edu.au and converted to the johnson - cousins system using equations from faccioli et al.(2007 ) .",
    "we augmented our data with @xmath12 ( equivalent to johnson - cousins i ) data from the eros project ( kim et al .",
    "2014 ) . while the very precise ogle data are crucial for our analysis , the inclusion of the macho and eros data in our study was important for an accurate determination of the orbital period of the ogle lmc562.05.9009 system , and to improve the coverage of the secondary eclipse in the light curve .",
    "they also helped to considerably improve the pulsational v - band light curve of the cepheid .",
    "the macho @xmath10-band and eros data were shifted in flux and magnitude to fit the ogle data by the minimization of the difference between the out - of - eclipse light curves . this way the light curves were forced to have the same average magnitude .",
    "the macho @xmath11-band light curve was left unmodified .",
    "the flux shift was later modeled by adding a third light in this band which simulates a flux shift , which may appear due to any calibration error .",
    "the individual photometric data are given on the same webpage as the radial velocity data ( see above ) , and are shown in figure 1 .",
    "in figure 2 , we show the pulsational light curves of the cepheid in the i , r and v bands , as obtained from the out - of - eclipse photometric data folded with the pulsation period of the star .",
    "these data resemble light curves of very low scatter with an asymmetrical shape typical for a cepheid pulsating in the fundamental mode .",
    "the fourier decomposition parameters of the i - band light curve of the cepheid , shown in figure 3 , clearly confirm that the star is indeed a fundamental mode pulsator .",
    "the pulsation period of the cepheid is very accurately determined from the current data . from the v band data ,",
    "we obtain a period of 2.9878463 ( 09 ) days , while the i band data yield a period of 2.9878466 ( 16 ) days , leading to the uncertainty of the pulsation period quoted in table 3 which is consistent with the absolute value of rate of period change being @xmath130.1 s / yr . the o - c diagrams for both the i and",
    "v band data do not display any secular systematic change , confirming that the total uncertainty on the period as given in table 3 is correctly estimated .",
    "figure 4 shows the orbital light curve of the system for the ogle iv i - band data , folded on the orbital period of 1550.4 days , and with the pulsational variations of the cepheid removed .",
    "it is seen that the orbit of the lmc562.05.9009 system is highly eccentric , and that both the primary and secondary eclipses are covered by the data .    in order to determine the effective temperatures of the component stars",
    ", we augmented our dataset with 12 epochs of j and k photometry which were obtained outside the eclipses .",
    "these data were taken with the sofi near - infrared camera attached to the eso ntt 3.5 m telescope on la silla . the reduction and calibration of the data to the ukirt system ( hawarden et al .",
    "2001 ) was done following the procedure described in detail in pietrzyski et al .",
    "the accuracy of the zero points in both bands is 0.015 mag , and instrumental errors are not larger than 0.01 mag .",
    "> from the analysis of the radial velocity curve of a binary star one can obtain the orbital parameters of the system . in the case of the studied system the procedure is complicated by the pulsational variability of the cepheid superimposed on the orbital motion . using the ravespan software",
    "we have fitted a model of keplerian orbit ( i.e. proximity effects were ignored , which is justified by the large distance of the components even at closest approach ) with an additional fourier series representing the pulsational radial velocity curve of the cepheid .",
    "we simultaneously fitted the reference time @xmath14 , the eccentricity @xmath15 , the argument of periastron @xmath16 , the velocity semi - amplitudes @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the systemic velocity @xmath19 , and nth - order fourier series . in the beginning",
    "systemic velocities of both components were fitted , but without any improvement in the fit and with the values equal within the errors . eventually only one velocity was kept .",
    "the period @xmath20 was initially held fixed at the estimated value of 1550.4 days .",
    "the fitting was later repeated with a fixed value of @xmath21 d and @xmath14 calculated from the photometric epoch of a primary minimum @xmath22 as a function of eccentricity and argument of periastron : @xmath23 to ensure the consistency of the model .",
    "the error of the eccentricity turned out to be 10 times higher and the error for the argument of periastron 6 times lower ( see solution 3 in table  [ tab : spec ] ) than the ones obtained from the photometry .",
    "for this reason we have tried to solve the system with @xmath15 and @xmath16 fixed ( solution 1 ) , or only @xmath15 fixed ( solution 2 ) .",
    "eventually we decided to adopt solution 2 as the final one because of the low error for @xmath15 from the photometry and the low error of @xmath16 from the orbital solution .    in this way we have obtained the coefficients describing the pulsational radial velocity curve and the parameters describing the orbital motion separately .",
    "the orbital radial velocity curve along with the best fitting model is shown in fig .",

    "we have previously used this package in the analysis of the ogle - lmc - cep-0227 system ( p13 ) , and we refer the reader to this work for more details .",
    "we varied the following parameters in deriving the final model : the fractional radius of the pulsating component at phase 0.0 ( pulsational ) , @xmath25 ; the fractional radius of the second component , @xmath26 ; the orbital inclination @xmath27 ; the orbital period , @xmath28 ; the epoch of the primary minimum , @xmath22 ; the component surface brightness ratios in all three photometric bands at phase 0.0 ( pulsational ) , @xmath29 ; and the third light in the @xmath30-band @xmath31 .",

    "the third light in the @xmath30-band was introduced because we were unable to transform it directly to the ogle photometric system .",

    "the relation of gieren et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for fundamental mode pulsators yields an expected mean radius value of @xmath39 for the pulsation period of the cepheid in our system which agrees with our determination ( @xmath40 ) within the combined 1 @xmath41 errors .",
    "the pr relations of sachkov ( 2002 ) for fundamental mode and first overtone cepheids predict radii of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , for a pulsation period of 2.988 days .",
    "the first value matches our derived radius value for the ogle lmc562.05.9009 cepheid much better , and is in agreement with the radius prediction from the gieren et al .",
    "( 1998 ) pr relation .",
    "we conclude that the radius value of the cepheid clearly supports fundamental mode pulsation , in agreement with the conclusion reached from the fourier decomposition parameters of the i - band light curve .",
    "the radius value together with the other physical parameters of the cepheid given in table 3 , particularly its mass , also leave no doubt that the pulsating star in the system is a classical ( and not a type - ii ) cepheid .",
    "our models constrain the projection factor of a cepheid in an eclipsing binary system in the way which has been discussed in detail in p13 .",
    "briefly , the shape of a cepheid light curve in a given photometric band is determined by the change of its surface temperature and its radius .",
    "the radius change is particularly important if the cepheid resides in an eclipsing binary system .",
    "the beginning and end of an eclipse may be shifted in time according to the instantaneous radius of the cepheid , and the visible area of the eclipsed stellar disk depends on the phase of the pulsating component . in our approach",
    "the cepheid variability is a part of the model , so we can trace the influence of the related parameters on the light curve . as a base we use the raw ( unscaled ) absolute radius change obtained from the pulsational radial velocity curve .",
    "then we scale its amplitude with the projection factor ( the @xmath24-factor scales linearly with the amplitude of the radius variation curve ) .",
    "a conversion from the absolute radii to the relative radii ( used in the light curve analysis ) is done by using the orbital solution .",
    "a comparison of the resulting model light curves with the data then directly constrains the @xmath24-factor value . from our best model",
    "we obtain a radius variation amplitude of 3.04 r@xmath44 for the cepheid , which corresponds to @xmath45 ( see figs . 6 and 9 ) .",
    "our current determination of the projection factor of the cepheid in the ogle lmc562.05.9009 system is the second reliable measurement of this important quantity for a cepheid in a binary , after the first determination made by p13 for ogle - lmc - cep-0227 .",
    "the value of @xmath5 is smaller than the predicted p - factor value from the most recent calibration of the p - factor relation of storm et al .",
    "( 2011 ) which yields @xmath46 for the pulsation period of the cepheid . however , there is possible agreement within the combined uncertainties of the two values .",
    "this is contrary to the finding for cep-0227 which has a pulsation period of 3.80 days and @xmath47 from our analysis in p13 , whereas its expected p - factor value from the storm et al .",
    "calibration is @xmath48 , with both values clearly discrepant within their respective uncertainties .",
    "the large difference of the p - factor values for the two binary cepheids for which we could determine this number so far with our method is also noteworthy ( the difference is 0.16 , whereas the p - factor relation of storm et al . predicts a difference of only 0.02 for a change of the period from 2.988 to 3.80 days .",
    "other p - factor relations , such as the theoretical relations of neilson et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , predict an even smaller change of @xmath24 between the two period values ) .",
    "our finding hints at the possibility that the p - factor - period relation may have an intrinsic dispersion , particularly in the short pulsation period range , where the discrepancy of the p - factor values predicted by different calibrations of the relation in the literature is largest ( see discussion in storm et al . 2011 and gieren et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "the extinction in the direction to the target was calculated in a similar way as described in pilecki et al.(2015 ) .",
    "we utilized the observed ( not extinction - corrected ) period - magnitude relations for fundamental mode cepheids in the lmc ( soszyski et al .",
    "2008 ) in the optical v and i bands . by comparing the observed mean magnitudes of the cepheid with the expected magnitudes for its period",

    "this color excess corresponds to a total extinction in the k - band of @xmath51 mag .",
    "the mean ( over the pulsation cycle of the cepheid ) observed ir magnitudes of the ogle lmc562.05.9009 system are @xmath52 and @xmath53 mag .",

    "the extinction - corrected magnitudes and colors of the primary and secondary components and their temperatures are given in table 3 .",
    "it is very interesting to note that within the uncertainties both components have the same effective temperatures , luminosities and surface gravities .",
    "however , according to the very precise ogle - iv photometry the secondary does not show any pulsations with amplitude larger than 0.01 mag .",
    "this is a striking result because , assuming the same chemical composition for both components in the system , we would expect both stars to be located within the instability strip ( see discussion next section ) .",
    "the fact that the secondary is non - pulsating and thus outside the instability strip could imply that the two components of ogle lmc562.05.9009 have significantly different abundances , which would make this system unique among known binary stars .",
    "a different , and probably more likely explanation is that the secondary is just a little cooler that the cepheid ( @xmath56 k ) , as suggested by our photometric solution 2 in table 2 . in that case",
    "the cepheid would reside almost exactly on the red boundary of the instability strip , with the secondary located just beyond the red edge .",

    "we calculated evolutionary tracks for the two component stars in the system and find that a isochrone for an age of 205 myr fits the observed positions of both stars in the luminosity - effective temperature plane , arguing for the same age of the cepheid and its red giant companion .",
    "the p - factor value for the cepheid is marginally consistent with the prediction of the p - factor relation of storm et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , as opposed to the p - factor we derived for ogle - lmc - cep-0227 in p13 , which is in significant disagreement with the prediction of the storm et al . relation .",
    "currently the situation regarding the correct p - factor values to use in baade - wesselink - type cepheid distance determinations is still very confusing .",
    "the measurements from the two binary cepheids in this paper and in p13 seem to support the idea that the p - factor for classical cepheids is not only period - dependent , but might also possess an intrinsic dispersion , at least for short pulsation periods in the range of a few days . clearly more work is needed to clarify this question , and one of the very few observational approaches which promise to solve the issue is the analysis of more cepheids in eclipsing binaries whose characteristics allow the determination of their p - factors .",
    "the most important parameter in this context is the radius variation amplitude of the cepheid ; the larger the amplitude , the stronger the effect of the radius variation on the binary light curve , and the smaller the uncertainty on the p - factor derived from our model .",
    "this was the reason why we could not measure the p - factor for the first overtone cepheid in the eclipsing system ogle - lmc - cep-2532 whose radius variation is too small to cause a significant effect on the binary light curve , given the quality of the photometric data ( pilecki et al .",
    "since fundamental mode cepheids tend to have larger radius variations , precise measurements of cepheid projection factors with our binary method will mostly be restricted to eclipsing systems containing fundamental mode cepheids .    in order to analyze the ogle lmc562.05.9009 system , and in particular its cepheid more fully",
    ", we plan to observe more eclipses ( both primary and secondary ) in the future , including coverage in near - infrared bands .",
    "a high quality out - of - eclipse the pulsational k - band light curve of the cepheid in tandem with the v - band light and pulsational radial velocity curves as determined in this paper will allow us to calculate the distance to the cepheid with the bw - type infrared surface brightness technique ( fouqu & gieren 1997 ; storm et al .",
    "2011 ) and compare it to the distance of its companion star determined from the binary analysis and a surface brightness - color relation , as described in pietrzynski et al .",
    "( 2009 , 2013 ) .",
    "such a comparison will put further constraints on the p - factor relation valid for classical cepheid variables .    our work has now revealed and analyzed the fifth eclipsing binary system containing a classical cepheid in orbit with a stable giant star .",
    "previous binary cepheids analyzed by our group are ogle - lmc - cep-0227 ( pietrzynski et al .",
    "2010 , p13 ) , ogle - lmc - cep-1812 ( pietrzynski et al . 2011 ) , ogle - lmc - cep-1718 ( gieren et al . 2014 ) , and ogle - lmc - cep-2532 ( pilecki et al . 2015 ) .",
    "the most exotic system is ogle - lmc - cep-1718 which contains two classical cepheids in a 413-day orbit .",
    "its analysis in gieren et al .",
    "( 2014 ) has been very challenging due to the multiple superimposed variations in the light- and radial velocity curves .",
    "we hope to improve on the analysis of that exciting system in the near future with additional data and possible improvements in our analysis code .",
    "for all systems but one , ogle - lmc - cep-1812 , the mass ratio is very close to , or consistent with unity .",
    "the exception in the case of ogle - lmc - cep-1812 is probably explained by the result reported by neilson et al .",
    "( 2015a ) that the cepheid in that system is actually the product of a stellar merger of two main sequence stars .",
    "from an observational point of view , there is a bias which favors the finding of systems composed of a cepheid in orbit with a giant star of similar mass and radius which leads not only to a higher probability to observe both eclipses , but also to observe the lines of both components in the composite spectra .",
    "for this reason , we can not argue that our results to - date on cepheids in double - lined eclipsing binary systems in the lmc contradict results regarding the binary distribution of cepheids as obtained by evans et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , or neilson et al .",
    "( 2015b ) .",
    "the binary cepheids in the lmc , with their dynamical masses determined to better than 2% , will be a cornerstone for improving our detailed understanding of cepheid pulsation and post - main sequence stellar evolution , and in general of our understanding of cepheid physics . with future precise distance determinations to these systems",
    "we hope to determine from the stable binary companions , these binary cepheids will also become excellent absolute calibrators of the extragalactic distance scale .",
