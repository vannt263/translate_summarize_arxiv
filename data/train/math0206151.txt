    "parrondian strategies are where losing games can cooperate to win ( harmer & abbott 1999@xmath0 ) .",
    "the original example of parrondo s games consist of two coin tossing games . game a consists of coin 1 biased to lose . game b consists of two coins  coin 2 with losing bias and coin 3 with winning bias  but a state - dependent rule is chosen to favour the losing coin 2 .",
    "hence both games a and b are losing games .",
    "however when a and b are alternated in a deterministic or even random manner , the player surprisingly has a winning expectation .",
    "this effect has been interpreted in terms of a discrete - time brownian ratchet , at length , elsewhere ( harmer & abbott 1999@xmath1 )  where conventional brownian ratchets ( doering 1995 ) have been the inspiration .",
    "an alternative view , we call the boston interpretation ( stanley 1999 , group discussion ) , recognises that although game b favours coin 2 with losing bias , if the state - dependence is removed game b now favours the winning coin 3  then when games a and b are mixed , game a has the affect of randomisation or ` break - up ' of game b s state - dependence , thus tilting favour towards coin 3 with winning bias .",
    "this explanation was also independently deduced by j.  maynard smith ( 1999 , personal communication ) .",
    "further to the ratchet interpretation and boston interpretation , this paper will examine another viewpoint by considering the process as a random walk in a periodic environment ( rwpe ) .",
    "we now briefly summarise the literature on parrondo s games . in ( harmer _",
    "2000@xmath0 ) the state - dependent rule , for game b , is to choose coin 2 if the player s capital is a multiple of some integer @xmath2  analysis showed the paradox could hold for general values of @xmath2 . in ( pearce , 2000@xmath0 )",
    "it is shown that the paradox can hold when both games a and b are multiple coin games . in ( pearce 2000@xmath1 )",
    "we have the first analysis of parrondo s games in terms of shannon entropy and in ( harmer _ et al . _",
    "2000@xmath1 ) the entropy parameter spaces are graphically displayed .",
    "the probability parameter space is shown in ( harmer _ et al . _",
    "2000@xmath3 ) . in ( lee _",
    "et al . _ 2000 ) a minimal three - state game with asymmetric transition probabilities is analysed and in ( parrondo _ et al . _ 2000 ) state - dependence on capital is replaced by dependence on the past history of the game , leading to a larger probability parameter space .",
    "the surge of interest in analysing parrondian games is motivated by a number of areas .",
    "information theorists have long studied the problem of producing a fair game from biased coins ( gargamo and vaccaro 1999 ) and the roots of this can be traced back to the work of von neumann ( 1951 ) ",
    "parrondo s games go a step further in producing a winning game from losing games .",
    "seigman ( 1999 , personal communication ) has reinterpreted ` capital ' of the games in terms electron occupancies of energy levels  the paradox can then be reproduced using the rate equation approach typically used in laser analysis . in the physical world",
    "there are many types of processes where losing helps to win , such as a sacrifice in the game of chess or a valley in the fitness landscape of an animal species .",
    "many biological effects are linked to ratchet type phenomena and westerhoff _ et al . _",
    "( 1986 ) have analysed enzyme transport with a four - state model .",
    "applicability to population genetics , evolution and economics has been suggested ( mcclintock 1999 ) . in finance ,",
    "maslov and zhang ( 1998 ) have shown that under certain conditions capital can grow by investing in an asset with _ negative _ typical growth rate .",
    "quantum ratchets have now been experimentally realised ( linke _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) and recasting parrondian games , based on ratchet phenomena , as quantum games ( eisert _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ; goldenberg _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ; meyer 1999 ) is thus of interest .    in control theory",
    ", it can be shown that the combination of two unstable systems can become stable ( allison & abbott 2000 ) .",
    "velocity of propagation through an array of coupled oscillators , under certain conditions , can _ increase _ even though the damping coefficient is _ increased _ ( sarmiento _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) . in the area of granular flow",
    ", drift can occur in a counter - intuitive direction such as exemplified in the famous brazil nut paradox ( rosato _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ) . also declining branching processes",
    "can be combined to increase ( key 1987 ) .",
    "plaskota ( 1996 ) shows that noisy information can sometimes be better than clean information . in ( pinsky and scheutzow 1992 )",
    "it is shown that with switched diffusion processes in random media it is possible to get a positive - recurrent processes ( _ i.e. _  with no drift ) from mixed transient processes ( _ i.e. _  with drifts all in the same direction )  this is almost certainly a continuous time analogue to the parrondian discrete - time process .",
    "assuming we construct parrondo s games to only deal in transactions of one unit of capital per event , then we have a skip - free process , and a statistical interpretation of the central result is that declining birth - death processes can be combined to form an increase .",
    "in this paper we further investigate parrondo s paradox . we construct a class of composite games and investigate their fairness by formulating the problem in the language of random walks in periodic environments ( rwpe ) .",
    "we find many new , interesting , and counter - intuitive results .",
    "we construct a composite game from two simple games @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "these two games can be combined in two ways : deterministically or stochastically .",
    "if we have played @xmath6 times , and @xmath6 is divisible by @xmath7 ( for an integer @xmath7 ) , we then play game @xmath4 .",
    "if we have played @xmath6 times and @xmath6 is not divisible by @xmath7 , we play game @xmath5",
    ". thus games @xmath4 and @xmath5 are alternated in a deterministic pattern .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 our capital after @xmath6 plays of this game .    to alternate games @xmath4 and @xmath5 randomly we toss a coin with probability @xmath9 of heads . if the coin comes up heads , we play game @xmath4 , and if tails , we play game @xmath5 .",
    "we denote by @xmath10 be our capital after @xmath6 repetitions .",

    "the process @xmath8 is not a rwpe , but the process @xmath12 is a rwpe .",
    "as shown in  4 we extend this construction to define composite games from more than two simple games . in each case",
    "we identify the capital of the player as a rwpe .",
    "we say that a game is fair , winning or losing if the random walk for the capital of a player , @xmath13 , is recurrent or transient to @xmath14 , or to @xmath15 , respectively .",

    "what is surprising to us is that one can find non - trivial cases where random walks in periodic environments with negative drift can be combined to form random walks in periodic environments with positive drift , parrondo s paradox .",
    "we believe that these reversals arise because combining these processes in the manner described above radically changes the frequency at which transitions are governed by probability distributions with positive means , and that future investigations should center on investigating these frequencies .",
    "it is likely that it will be easier to understand this phenomenon in the case of stochastic combinations of the processes since these always lead to the study of nearest neighbour random walks in periodic environments .",
    "when a composite game is constructed from simple 3periodic games , parrondo s paradox is much more interesting and complex than in the case of 2periodic games . as shown in figure  9 , by varying one parameter three state transitions of the composed game may be observed .",

    "as shown in  3 , a game constructed by composing deterministically 2periodic fair games leads to a pseudo  paradox . in general ,",
    "a game composed from an even number of 2periodic fair games always exhibits a pseudo  paradox ( key & kosek 2000 ) .",
