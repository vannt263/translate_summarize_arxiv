    "infrared astronomical satellite low resolution spectrometer ( lrs ) recorded spectra of some 50,000 sources in blue ( @xmath2 m ) with @xmath3 and in red ( @xmath4 m ) with a resolution @xmath5 . a total of 5425 objects with better quality spectra were included in the atlas of low - resolution iras spectra ( 1986 , hereafter the atlas ) .",
    "volk & cohen ( 1989a ) published spectra of 356 iras point sources with @xmath6 that were not included in the atlas .",
    "these brighter sources were classified into nine classes based upon the spectral morphology .",
    "sixty percent of the sources have silicate emission and red - continuum spectra associated with h ii region sources .",
    "no emission - line sources formed part of the set of 356 spectra .",
    "this sample was also used to test the classification scheme of iras sources based on broad - band colors .",
    "classifiable spectra were found for 338 of the sources in the sample .",
    "the remaining 18 sources had either extremely noisy or incomplete spectra .",
    "it was found that some class of sources overlapped on the color - color diagrams and , therefore , the nature of some of the iras sources could not be determined from the iras photometry .",
    "volk et al .",
    "( 1991 ) published an additional 486 spectra belonging to sources with @xmath7 fluxes between @xmath8 and @xmath9 that were also not in the atlas .",
    "classifiable spectra were found for 424 sources .",
    "the spectra were classified into nine groups as in volk & cohen ( 1989a ) that describe the astrophysical nature of these sources .",
    "kwok , volk & bidelman ( 1997 ) processed 11,224 spectra ( including sources in the atlas ) , corresponding to a flux limit of @xmath10 at @xmath7 .",
    "these spectra were also classified by - eye and put into nine classes based on the presence of emission and absorption features and on the shape of the continuum .",
    "they identified optical counterparts of these iras sources in the existing optical and infrared catalogs and listed the optical spectral types if they were known .",
    "it is evident that large databases like the one referred to above require automated schemes for any analysis .",
    "artificial neural networks ( ann ) have been employed extensively in several branches of astronomy for automated data analysis ( lahav & storrie - lombardi , 1994 ) .",
    "ann have been used previously by the iucaa group in three distinct areas of stellar astronomy .",
    "they have been applied to classify digitized optical and ultraviolet spectra ( gulati et .",
    "1994a , b ; singh et al .",
    "1998 ) ; to compare a set of observed spectra of f & g dwarfs with a library of synthetic spectra ( gulati et al .",
    "1997a , gupta et al .",
    "2001 ) ; and to determine the reddening properties of hot stars from the low - dispersion ultraviolet spectra ( gulati et al .",
    "1997b ) .",
    "we have attempted to classify 2000 brightest sources from the atlas into 17 classes by means of artificial neural networks . in the next section",
    "we describe features of the 17 new classes . in section 3 ,",
    "we present details of the ann scheme .",
    "results are discussed in section 4 and important conclusions of the study are presented in the last section .",
    "further , an appendix has been added just before the reference section , to explain the general ann architecture for the benefit of the readers .",
    "0.5 cm the set of 2000 spectra were classified into the 17 classes by - eye by one of us ( k.  volk ) .",
    "these classifications are assumed to from the reference set of `` correct '' classifications . such by - eye classification has an element of subjectivity in it , and is more apt to have problems when the spectra are noisy .",
    "this set of 2000 sources are the brightest sources in the lrs atlas and have the least problems with noise or spectral peculiarities .",
    "this makes the by - eye classification as accurate as possible despite the element of subjectivity .",
    "the groups used for spectral classification are an extension of the nine classes described in volk & cohen ( 1989a ) .",
    "the current scheme introduces more classes , for three reasons :    0.5 cm ( a ) the `` hii region sources '' group shows a variety of features , and so separate classes have been made for the more obvious feature types so that these classes are , one hopes , more uniform ;    0.5 cm ( b ) a few new classes have been created within the 10 @xmath11 m silicate feature and 11.3 @xmath11 m sic feature groups to divide the objects with weaker features from those with stronger features ; and    0.5 cm ( c ) some small groups of unusual sources can be identified from the `` usual / unknown '' group of volk & cohen ( 1989a ) , hence these were given their own classes here such as class 14 for 21 @xmath11 m feature sources .",
    "the division between the spectra with `` stronger '' and `` weaker '' features was made at lrs type 25 or 45 ( for silicate emission sources and sic emission feature sources respectively ) since the original lrs classes are based upon the feature strength .",
    "thus the spectra with strong features , lrs types 25 to 29 or 45 to 49 , are separated from the spectra with weaker features , lrs types 21 to 24 or 41 to 44 .",
    "all objects with lrs classes near the dividing line were examined by - eye to make sure that the lrs type accurately reflects the feature strength . in some cases this led to spectra",
    "being placed into the `` stronger '' or `` weaker '' feature groups even when the lrs type is not as expected . in the large majority of cases",
    "no problem with the lrs type was found .",
    "a short summary of the 17 classes is given in table 1 , with representative spectra plotted in figure 1 .",
    "a detailed description of the different classes and their relation to the original lrs types now follows :    0.5 cm * ( 0 ) line emission sources *    0.5 cm this class is for spectra with strong emission lines ( line peak to continuum ratio of 1 or larger ) and no obvious dust emission or absorption features .",
    "these are nearly all planetary nebula sources .",
    "a few cases of hii region sources that may show the 12.8 @xmath11 m [ neii ] line could have been included here , but were left in the other `` hii region '' groups since the 12.8 @xmath11 m emission line seen in lrs spectra is sometime due to an instrumental problem rather than being an actual emission line , and since the possible [ neii ] lines were relatively weak .",
    "comparatively few hii region spectra have strong enough emission lines as observed by the lrs instrument to be potentially included in this group . in the original lrs classification , these are generally classified as types 81 to 96 .",
    "the prototype spectrum in figure 1 shows several emission lines : 9.0 @xmath11 m [ ariii ] , 12.8 @xmath11 m [ neii ] , 15.5 @xmath11 m [ nev ] , and 18.7 @xmath11 m [ siii ]",
    ". other objects in this class tend to have fewer emission lines than this example .",
    "0.5 cm * ( 1 ) sources with stronger 11.3 @xmath11 m sic emission features *    0.5 cm in this group one has evolved carbon stars undergoing mass loss and showing a strong 11.3 @xmath11 m emission feature . in the original lrs classification these would be type 45 to 49 sources , implying the feature peak to estimated continuum ratio is larger than 1.648",
    ".    0.5 cm * ( 2 ) stellar continuum sources *    0.5 cm here is the class for stars without circumstellar dust shells that radiate significantly in the 8 to 23 @xmath11 m region , including vega , sirius , aldebaran , and antares .",
    "most of these sources are of k - type to early m - type . only a few have spectral types earlier than k0 . in the original lrs classification",
    "these would be type 16 to 19 sources    0.5 cm * ( 3 ) featureless sources with cooler colour temperatures *    0.5 cm this group is as in volk & cohen ( 1989a ) .",
    "the continuum colour temperature is lower than expected for the photospheric emission of any normal star , including late m - type stars . aside from the unusually low colour temperature for a stellar photosphere",
    "there is no overt sign of any dust emission .",
    "many of these sources have optical counterparts among known mira or irregular variables of m - type . in the original lrs classification",
    "these would be type 12 to 15 sources .",
    "all featureless continuum sources with @xmath12f@xmath13 ratios of less than 3 between 7.9 and 11 @xmath11 m but which still have declining continua over the lrs wavelength range are placed in this class .    0.5 cm * ( 4 ) sources with uir features at 7.6/8.5/11.3/12.5 @xmath11 m *    0.5 cm this group includes sources with the uir features , except for those with very steep ( `` red '' according to the lrs atlas definition ) continua which form class 16 .",
    "these would ideally be type 80 sources in the original lrs classification , but there was considerable confusion with other types of objects .",
    "as long as the spectrum signal to noise ratio is reasonable it is possible to objectively distinguish between uir feature spectra and silicate absorption , as discussed in volk & cohen ( 1989b ) .",
    "0.5 cm * ( 5 ) sources with 10 @xmath11 m silicate absorption *    0.5 cm this class includes objects with silicate absorption features , but we attempt to exclude cases of compact hii regions with foreground silicate absorption which have much lower continuum colour temperature than the `` normal '' silicate absorption feature sources such as iras 01304@xmath146211 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "if the spectral continuum is rising from 7.6 to 23 @xmath11 m and there is a silicate absorption feature at 10 @xmath11 m the spectrum is put in class 9 . in the original lrs classification class 5",
    "sources correspond to types 31 to 39 .",
    "an additional refinement is that sources that are in transition between silicate emission and silicate absorption at 10 @xmath11 m are grouped in class 13 .    0.5 cm * ( 6 ) sources with strong silicate emission at 10 @xmath11 m *    0.5 cm spectra with a falling continuum over the lrs wavelength range and having a silicate emission feature with a peak greater than 1.628 times the continuum are in this class",
    ". these would be types 25 to 29 in the original lrs classification .",
    "similar spectra but with weaker features are put into class 12 .    0.5 cm * ( 7 ) sources with low temperature ( @xmath15k ) dust continuum emission *    0.5 cm in this group are mostly hii region spectra which do not show very strong features due to silicates or the uir features",
    ". the continuum must rise over the lrs wavelength range from 7.6 to 23 @xmath11 m for a spectrum to be included in this class , corresponding roughly to a colour temperature of less than 100@xmath16k , but generally the continuum shape can not be described by a single colour temperature . in the original lrs classification these would have been given some type in the 60 s , 70 s , or 80 s .",
    "in a few unusual cases there can be other types of spectra mixed into this group .",
    "when there are accompanying strong features such as the 10 @xmath11 m feature in emission or absorption the spectra are put into classes 8 , 9 , or 12 .    0.5 cm * ( 8 ) sources with silicate emission and a low temperature dust continuum *    0.5 cm here are spectra with continuum shape similar to that of class 7 but with a clear 10 @xmath11 m silicate emission feature . in principle",
    "this corresponds to types 61 to 69 in the original lrs classification .",
    "some of the sources are hii regions , but others are young planetary nebulae such as hb 12 , vy 2 - 2 , and swst-1 ; others are their immediate progenitors caught in the phase between the asymptotic giant branch phase and the planetary nebula phase ( `` protoplanetary nebulae '' or ppns ) such as hd 161796 and iras 18095@xmath142704 .",
    "the spectrum of 18095@xmath142704 is shown in figure 1 ; this has unusually strong features and the continuum is not as steeply rising as is typically the case for spectra in this class .    0.5 cm * ( 9 ) sources with silicate emission and a low temperature dust continuum *    0.5 cm this is another class where the continuum is required to rise over the lrs wavelength range from 7.6 to 23 @xmath11 m .",
    "here we include spectra showing the 10 and 18 @xmath11 m silicate features in absorption .",
    "these are nearly all compact hii region sources with ( presumably ) foreground cold dust in the associate molecular cloud . in the original lrs classification",
    "these would be type 71 to 79 sources .",
    "0.5 cm * ( 10 ) extreme carbon stars *    0.5 cm the prototype for this group is afgl 3068 ( iras 23166@xmath141655 ) , which is known to be a carbon star with an extremely optically thick dust shell .",
    "the spectra are selected for this group on the basis of having low colour temperatures ( of order 300@xmath16k ) in the 10 @xmath11 m region of the spectrum and of having no strong emission or absorption features . in some cases",
    "there is some type of weak feature around 11 @xmath11 m which might be due to the 11.3 @xmath11 m sic feature in emission or weak absorption .",
    "these objects are discussed in volk , kwok , & langill ( 1992 ) .",
    "0.5 cm * ( 11 ) low colour temperature featureless spectra *    0.5 cm the group of spectra have low colour temperature ( about 150 to 200@xmath16k ) featureless continua .",
    "they have noticeably lower colour temperatures than the extreme carbon star spectra see figure 1 ) but peak somewhere in the lrs wavelength range and decline thereafter , unlike the hii region spectra in classes 7 , 9 , and 16 .",
    "a few of these sources are known to be either young planetary nebulae or ppns , and they all seem to have carbon - based dust shells .",
    "these objects are discussed by volk , kwok & woodsworth ( 1993 ) . in the original lrs classification",
    "they were generally assigned type 05 or 50 .",
    "0.5 cm * ( 12 ) sources with weaker silicate emission features *    0.5 cm this group of spectra is the analogue of class 6 , but they have feature peak to continuum ratios of less than 1.628 . in the original lrs atlas classification",
    "these would be type 21 to 24 spectra .",
    "in various cases the feature was not detected at all in the original lrs atlas classification and these were generally classified as type 15 to 18 .    0.5 cm * ( 13 ) sources with intermediate optical depth silicate dust shells *    0.5 cm prototype spectra for this class include iras 19192@xmath140922 , iras 17125@xmath174814 , iras 15119@xmath176453 , and iras 16546@xmath174047 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "all these spectra have continua which fall between 7.6 and 23 @xmath11 m .",
    "the optical depth of the dust shells in these objects is such that the 10 @xmath11 m feature is in transition between emission and absorption while the 18 @xmath11 m feature is still in emission . in the original lrs classification these",
    "were often confused with sic emission spectra , and so given erroneous types of 41 to 45 .",
    "0.5 cm * ( 14 ) source with the 21 @xmath11 m feature *    0.5 cm a small number of sources are known to have a dust feature at 21 @xmath11 m , one possible identification of which is tic grains ( von helden et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "the feature was discovered in the lrs spectra .",
    "less than 20 such sources are known , the brighter of which are used to define the group here .",
    "all sources in this group are carbon - rich ppns .",
    "a few extreme carbon stars and the planetary nebula ic 418 appear to have very weak 21 @xmath11 m features , but these require the _ infrared space observatory _ to detect and so they are not included here .    0.5 cm * ( 15 ) sources with weaker 11.3 @xmath11 m sic emission *    0.5 cm all spectra from carbon stars with the 11.3 @xmath11 m feature but with a feature to continuum ratio of less and 1.628 are put in this group , which is closely analogous to class 1 . in the original lrs classification",
    "these would be of type 41 to 44 .",
    "0.5 cm * ( 16 ) cool continuum sources with strong uir features *    0.5 cm any spectrum which has a continuum that rises from 7.6 to 23 @xmath11 m ( allowing for the possibility of a strong 7.6 @xmath11 m feature at the short wavelength end of the spectrum ) and strong uir features at 7.6 and 11.3 @xmath11 m is placed in this class .",
    "these are hii region spectra with uir features . in the original lrs classification",
    "these would be of type 80 or 81 . in some cases",
    "is is possible that there is an underlying silicate absorption component as well as the uir features , causing a very large rise at the short wavelength end of the lrs spectrum .",
    "however these spectra lack any 18 @xmath11 m absorption feature which makes the presence of strong 10 @xmath11 m silicate absorption less likely .",
    "in this analysis , we have used the multi - layer back - propagation ( mbpn ) neural network scheme with supervised learning as described in gulati et al .",
    "( 1994a , b ) .",
    "this scheme requires a set of spectra to be predefined as the training set and should include all the classes of the unknown set that the network is supposed to classify .",
    "the algorithm trains on this training set and subsequently in the test phase , classifies the unknown test set into the predefined classes .",
    "a training set of 170 spectra having 10 sources for each training class was set aside for training purposes .",
    "1 shows a representative sample of each of these 17 classes .",
    "each spectrum consists of 93 flux values in the range of @xmath18 m .",
    "we may mention that 148 numbers of the 170 training spectra were included in the 2000 test spectra for validity checks .",
    "the ann scheme involved using this set of 170 input spectra with 17 assigned classes ( 0 to 16 ) to train the ann algorithm .",
    "we refer to these classes as the catalog classes .",
    "the ann configuration used was 93 - 16 - 16 - 17 , implying 93 data points for each of the 17 output spectral classes with two hidden layers of 16 nodes each ( a detailed explanation on the ann architecture is given in the appendix ) .",
    "the training session involved an iterative procedure with the network weights getting modified at each iteration . during an iteration ,",
    "the computed output and the desired output were compared and the resultant error was then utilized to modify the network weights for the next iteration using a back propagation algorithm .",
    "the learning or training was stopped once the error was minimized to a predefined level and the network weights were considered to be frozen ( gulati et al . 1994a ) . a learning curve for 10000 iterations is given in fig .",
    "2 ( left panel ) .",
    "subsequent to the above training session , the test session uses the frozen weights determined above to perform the classification of the 2000 test set of spectra into 17 catalog classes .",

    "this process also improved the classification of the class 6 sources which is shown in fig .",
    "we split off class 12 from class 6 because it improved the classification of silicate emission objects .",
    "with the full range of silicate emission objects in one class there was more dispersion of values and the ann system had more chance of misclassification .",
    "however , it does not matter that sources are misclassified from class 6 to class 12 or class 12 to class 6 because the dividing line between these two groups is not sharp an there is a continuous range of silicate feature strengths , and some objects must fall at the boundary .",
    "6 shows the improvement in the class 13 classification , namely earlier 85 sources of this class were wrongly classified as class 6 which has now reduced to 50 wrong classifications .",
