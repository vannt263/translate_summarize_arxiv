    "following the discovery of a ferromagnetic transition at temperatures in excess of @xmath0 , the diluted iii - v magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) , which are realized by doping a semiconducting host material with low concentrations of magnetic impurities ( typically manganese ) , have attracted a great deal of attention from both the experimental and theoretical point of view due to their potential in spintronics applications @xcite .    in dms , low concentrations of magnetic impurities carrying localized magnetic moments ( spins )",
    "form a diluted spin system .",
    "the random spatial distribution of the magnetic impurities breaks the translational symmetry of the crystal and thus greatly complicates the theoretical description of the material@xcite .",
    "several different theoretical methods@xcite have been performed to get the transition temperatures . in some stages of these calculations ,",
    "disorder effects have been completely neglected or treated within the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations@xcite seem to provide a better way to include the positional disorder , but these theories usually assume classical spins .",
    "a proper treatment of the positional disorder of the localized moments and their quantum nature is necessary@xcite .",
    "recently , _",
    "ab initio _ calculations with supercell approaches @xcite are used to investigate the effects of disorder .",
    "alternatively , the stochastic series expansion ( sse ) quantum mc ( qmc ) method with @xmath1 supercell is used to investigate the order - disorder transition in the diluted two - dimensional heisenberg model with random site dilution@xcite .",
    "but there are still doubts concerning the effect of disorder on magnetism .",
    "in fact , the effect of disorder on magnetism is an old and important problem in diluted spin systems@xcite , although only during the last few years have disorder effects in dms been considered . in these early papers , a typical method is using coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) that is initially developed by soven and taylor@xcite to treat the dynamics of a random heisenberg - type hamiltonian .",
    "however , most of these methods only include the short - range interaction and are hard to extend to the long - range exchange interaction . up to now , lots of methods of investigating spin systems such as sse - qmc@xcite and density matrix renormalization group thoery@xcite only take into account short - range or nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "but the experimental fact of the transition temperature with low concentrations implies that the exchange interaction between the localized moments is long - ranged in dms@xcite .",
    "it means the long - range exchange interactions should be also included in the theoretical calculation of the magnetization and the transition temperature .",
    "another method for calculating the properties of disordered systems is the augmented space formalism ( asf)@xcite , which is introduced by mookerjee@xcite and centers around averaging functions of independent random variables . rather than expanding the green function in some manner and then averaging an appropriate set of terms ,",
    "the random problem is transformed into an ordered one which is defined in a larger hilbert space .",
    "this new hilbert space is referred to as the augmented space , which may be described as the direct product of the hilbert space spanned by the original hamiltonian with a `` disorder '' space that describes the random variables .",
    "on transforming to this augmented space , a new nonrandom hamiltonian can be defined such that configurational averages in real space for the random solid are equal to inner products in the augmented space@xcite .    in this article",
    ", we present a new approach , which combines the supercell approach and the asf , to study theoretically the influence of position disorder of magnetic ions on magnetization and the transition temperature in diluted spin systems on a disordered heisenberg model .",
    "firstly , the size of the supercell determines the concentration of magnetic ions in the host materials .",
    "there is one magnetic ion per supercell which , however , can only occupy the same site in a supercell ( the _ diluted and ordered _ case ) or can occupy any site in a supercell ( the _ diluted and disordered _ case ) . in the _ diluted and disordered _ case , the distance between two magnetic ions therefore becomes a random variable and then the effective heisenberg exchange integrals , which are assumed to be a function of distance only , are random variables . in the framework of the asf ,",
    "the random exchange integrals are extended to matrices .",
    "furthermore , the obtained spectral densities are used to calculate the temperature dependence of magnetization and curie temperature of systems .",
    "significantly , the spins are treated quantum mechanically in our approach although we use the supercell approach just like mc simulations .",
    "moreover , the long - range exchange integrals are included .",
    "it should be mentioned here that the direct numerical diagonalization of the green function@xcite is only applicable to the case of the finite size systems although it is a good method to include the long - range exchange integrals and to treat the spins quantum mechanically .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "the theoretical methods are described in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "section [ sec : numerical_studies ] is concerned with the numerical studies and discussion . in section",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we conclude the article with a summary .",
    "for a diluted spin material @xmath2 ( a : non - magnetic ; b : magnetic ) , the concentration @xmath3 ( @xmath4 $ ] ) of magnetic ion b is the ratio of the number of magnetic ions to all ions . if we consider a supercell that is built by non - magnetic ions with only * one * substituted by magnetic ions , the size of the supercell decides the concentration @xmath3 .",
    "for example , for simple cubic ( sc ) systems , the concentration @xmath3 equals to @xmath5 for the supercell with size @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 refer to the numbers of ions in @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 axis , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig : supercell ] , as an example , we give two kinds of possible realizations of a sc @xmath13 supercell that corresponds to the concentration @xmath14 : ( a ) _ diluted and ordered _ case , and ( b ) _ diluted and disordered _ case . each magnetic ion is located in the same lattice site of the supercell in ( a ) , but in any possible site of the supercell in ( b ) .     a two dimension view of the sc @xmath15 supercell ( @xmath14 ) for ( a ) _ diluted and ordered _ case , and ( b ) _ diluted and disordered _ case .",
    "the small crosses represent the lattice sites and the black circles show the lattice sites occupied by magnetic ions . ]    to study the magnetic properties of diluted magnetic systems , we use the effective heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath16 here @xmath17 and @xmath18 label the sites occupied by the magnetic ions and is the magnetic moment at lattice site @xmath17 with lattice vector @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , in our supercell approximation , @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be also referred to the labels of the supercell because there is only one magnetic ion in each cell .",
    "the exchange parameter @xmath20 is assumed to be a function of the distance @xmath21 only , independent of local environment .",
    "the hamiltonian also contains a zeeman coupling with external magnetic field .    introducing the retarded magnon green s function @xmath22 where @xmath23 , its equation of motion reads @xmath24 to decouple the higher - order green s function",

    "thus , the matrix form of green s function can be expressed as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the identity matrix and the matrix @xmath30 has the elements @xmath31 which belong to the hilbert space @xmath32 .    in the concentrated case ,",

    "case if one considers all the distances @xmath42 between two magnetic ions as equal to the @xmath43 between the respective supercells . due to the translational symmetry of the supercell",
    ", it is chosen as the wigner - seitz unit cell .",
    "the shell structure is determined by the spatial distribution of the supercells .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : supercell ] , if the supercell @xmath17 is set as the central supercell that refers to the @xmath38-th shell , the supercells @xmath18 and @xmath44 belong to the first shell and the supercell @xmath7 belongs to the second shell .    but for the diluted spin system , equation ( [ eq : greenf_momentum ] )",
    "is not appropriate to be used directly because each lattice has different neighboring environment and the exchange integral between two supercells is different .",
    "the translational symmetry on lattice and supercell is absent . according to ( b ) , the _ diluted and disordered _ case of the fig .",
    "[ fig : supercell ] , the distance between two magnetic ions , which can occupy any site in their own supercell , is a random variable , e.g. @xmath42 .",
    "then all possible distances between two magnetic ions in different supercells are described as a set of independent random variables .",
    "for example , in the framework of the shell structure , the set of all possible distances between two magnetic ions , which belong to the @xmath9-th supercell of the @xmath36-th shell and the central supercell , is @xmath45 with the probability @xmath46 where @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "it leads to the exchange integrals @xmath48 represented as a random variables set @xmath49 with the probability density @xmath50 it should be mentioned that , according to the shell structure , the set of exchange integrals @xmath48 and the probability density @xmath51 in the @xmath36-th shell are the same when @xmath9 runs over each supercell in the @xmath36-th shell .",
    "so , one simplifies them as @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    for each random variable @xmath52",
    ", according to the augmented space theorem , one can introduce a new hilbert space @xmath54 such that @xmath53 corresponds to a suitably chosen operator @xmath55 on @xmath54 of rank @xmath44 , spanned by @xmath44 possible values of @xmath52 . if @xmath56 ( usually @xmath57 ) belongs to an orthonormal basis in @xmath54 ,",
    "then @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the identity operator on the space @xmath54 . in other words , @xmath56 and @xmath55",
    "are chosen such that the spectral density of the operator @xmath55 with respect to @xmath56 is the given probability distribution . with the suitable choice of the basis , the tridiagonal matrix representation of @xmath55 has @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) down the diagonal and @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) down the off - diagonal positions , which can be obtained by the continued - fraction expansion : @xmath64",
    "thus the random exchange integral @xmath52 is transformed into the matrix representation @xmath55 in the hilbert space @xmath54 where the randomness of the exchange parameters is completely included .",
    "now , in the framework of the asf , each supercell has the same spin term and the exchange integral from the central supercell to one special shell has the same matrix form .",
    "no supercell in the configurational distribution is distinguishable from any other .",
    "in other words , in the diluted spin system , the translational invariance that is destroyed on lattice is recovered on the supercell while the randomness is masked in the exchange integral matrix @xmath55 .",
    "note , the exchange integral matrix @xmath55 is the same within one and the same shell , but different among the different shells . here , we want to mention an interesting technique : the combinatorial method@xcite that reduces initial eigenproblem to a less - dimensional one . in the case of finite systems , considering symmetry properties including methods of algebraic combinatorics , the hamiltonian matrix is transformed to a block ( quasidiagonal ) form and the numerical solutions of eigenproblem are high precision and small resultant . in our approaches , due to recovering in the translational invariances , one can use the equation ( [ eq : greenf_momentum ] ) to study an infinite system .    in the asf ,",
    "the configurational averages in real space are replaced by inner products in the augmented space @xmath65 , where the `` disorder '' space @xmath66 with @xmath67 being @xmath39 times the direct product of @xmath68 and @xmath39 is the total number of the supercells in the @xmath36-th shell .",
    "moreover , @xmath69 is an orthonormal basis in the `` disorder '' space @xmath70 , where @xmath71 .",

    "it should be mentioned that the equation ( [ eq : j_r_longrange ] ) is used just for illustration of the present approach , although the neglected effect of disorder on the value of exchange integrals@xcite should be included .",

    "that is the reason why the calculation of the @xmath107 structure in the _ diluted and ordered _ case shows the well - known symmetric shape of a simple cubic density of states except for the change of the bandwidth . for the @xmath109 and @xmath15 supercells structures ,",
    "in the _ diluted and ordered _ case , there are more than one peak because of including the exchange interactions belonging to next nearest - neighbor(nnn ) or other longer - range supercells . in addition , there is one peak in the @xmath109 and @xmath15 structures being in the same position as that in the @xmath107 structure .",
    "it means all the magnetic ions and the exchange interactions in the @xmath107 structure are also included in the @xmath109 and @xmath15 structures .",
    "it should be noted here that the long - range exchange interactions between magnetic ions are included in the nearest - neighbor supercells because the exchange interactions are based on the positions of magnetic ions .",
    "[ fig : dos ] also shows that the peaks of the magnon spectral density move toward lower energies for decreasing concentrations of the magnetic ions .",
    "it shows that dilution increases the magnon spectral density for lower energies at the cost of the magnon spectral density at higher energies .",

    "[ fig : dos ] .",
    "however , it is clearly shown in the figures that the influence of dilution is more important than that of disorder . furthermore",
    ", the obviously separated peaks in the _ diluted and ordered _ case disappear in the _ diluted and disordered _ case because the random position distribution of the magnetic ions leads to a dispersion of the exchange integrals , while the exchange integral between two supercells is a single value in the _ diluted and ordered _ case . at the same time",
    ", it is clear that the dispersion of the exchange integrals leads to the long tails that extend to high energy magnons area , especially for the @xmath107 structure in the panel of power - law interactions .",
    "it is quite interesting to note that the damping factor also increases the magnon spectral density for lower energies . from the expression of the damped - rkky exchange integrals",
    ", one finds that the exponential damping will decrease the strength of the short - range interaction less than that of the long - range one .",
    "compared with the rkky exchange interaction , it leads to the clearer separation of the exchange integral distribution for the damped - rkky exchange interaction in the _ diluted and ordered _ case .",
    "it is especially clear for the @xmath15 structure .",
    "but in the _ diluted and disordered _ case , the changing of the separation is not so obvious due to the dispersions of the exchange integrals .",
    "magnetization @xmath110 as function of temperature @xmath111 for @xmath102 on an sc lattice for various concentrations for the _ diluted and ordered _ case and the _ diluted and disordered _ case with @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 . ]    the temperature dependence of magnetization , which is calculated from the magnon spectral density in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] , is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : s_z ] .",
    "the figures show that all curves of magnetization decreases to zero monotonically and smoothly with increasing temperature from @xmath112 to @xmath113 . from the equation ( [ eq : eqtc ] )",
    ", one knows that increasing magnon spectral density at lower energies will lead to decrease the curie temperature .",
    "it is clearly shown by the influence of dilution on curie temperature because dilution strongly shifts the magnon spectral density to lower energies .",
    "dilution increases the distance between two magnetic ions and further decreases the strength of the exchange integrals .",
    "in other words , the influence of dilution on curie temperature mainly comes from decreasing of the effective exchange interactions .",
    "disorder also influences curie temperature @xmath114 , but not so important as dilution .",
    "the random distribution of the magnetic ions leads to the dispersions of the exchange integrals .",
    "that increases the lower energy part of magnon spectral density and is the reason why disorder lowers the curie temperature .",
    "it is especially clear for the @xmath109 and @xmath15 structures .",
    "however , for the @xmath107 structure of power - law interactions , curie temperature @xmath114 is slightly higher in the disordered case than that in the ordered case because the dispersions also increases the high energy part of magnon spectral density .",
    "the final effect of disorder on @xmath114 is the results of competition between the high energy magnons and the low energy magnons .",
    "if one uses an average value or a special value to substitute the dispersion of the exchange integrals , just like the mean - field approximation ( @xmath115 ) or the _ diluted and ordered _ case in our calculation , the influence of the dispersions of the exchange integrals will be washed out .",
    "the results show that the curie temperature is mainly influenced by dilution or the effective exchange interactions .",
    "it may explain the following fact . for a long time",
    ", it was rather surprising that the models that neglect the disorder and treat the exchange interaction in mfa provide a curie temperature in a good agreement with the experiment .",
    "although the positions of magnetic ions is randomly distributed , one may get a reasonably calculated curie temperature , which is near to the experimental curie temperature , by adjusting suitably the effective exchange integrals .",
    "moreover , given the level of dilution of the magnetic ions , the results suggest that the way to get high curie temperature dms materials is increasing the effective exchange integrals @xmath98 .    comparing the calculation of rkky and damped - rkky , we find there is a big influence of the exponential damping on curie temperature , which is even a more important factor than the position disorder of magnetic ions for @xmath116 in our calculation .",
    "the reasons to introduce the exponential damping is due to substitutional disorder or to the half - metallic character of ( ga , mn)as and ( ge , mn ) alloy , etc@xcite . in our theory , only the latter is meant because the positional disorder is already explicitly taken into account in our calculation .",
    "the obvious influence of damping on curie temperature suggests that the damping factor should be chosen carefully if one only wants to incorporate the damping exponential item to include the positional disorder influence , especially in model calculation .",
    "the aim of this article is to study the influence of dilution and disorder on the ferromagnetic properties of diluted spin systems . by combining the supercell approach and the asf",
    ", we study theoretically the influence of disorder on magnetization and curie temperature in diluted spin systems on a disordered heisenberg model .",
    "firstly , the size of the supercell is used to determine the concentration of magnetic ions because there is only one magnetic ion per supercell in our calculations . in order to investigate the influence of dilution and disorder on curie temperature ,",
    "the positions of magnetic ions in the supercells can be arranged in two ways : ( i ) the _ diluted and ordered _ case in which the magnetic ion is only able to occupy the same lattice within each supercell and ( ii ) the _ diluted and disordered _ case in which the magnetic ion is able to occupy any lattice point in the supercell .",
    "for the _ diluted and ordered _ case and the concentrated case , the equations of motion of the magnon green s function , which is decoupled by making tyablikov approximation , can be solved directly from fourier transformation because of the translational symmetry of the supercells .",
    "for the _ diluted and disordered _ case , the effective heisenberg exchange integrals , which are assumed to be a function of distance only , are random variables because the positions of two magnetic ions in the supercells is randomly distributed . by using asf ,",
    "the random exchange integrals between two supercells are extended to matrices , therewith restalling translational symmetry , in order to calculate the averaged magnon spectral density .",
    "then , the obtained averaged spectral densities have been used to calculate the temperature dependence of magnetization and the curie temperature .",
    "significantly , the long - range exchange integrals are included and all the calculations correspond to an infinite system and there is no cutting in the real space .",
    "the resulting theory is then solved numerically for a simple cubic system .",
    "the long - range ferromagnetic exchange integrals including power - law decaying , rkky type and damped - rkky type are used to calculate the temperature dependence of magnetization and curie temperature .",
    "the results show that dilution and the damping exponential item increase the magnon spectral density for lower energies at the cost of the magnon spectral density at higher energies .",
