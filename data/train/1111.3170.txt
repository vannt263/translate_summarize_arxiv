    "the radiation observed in the relativistic outflows of blazars and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) shows a high degree of variability .",
    "although the radiation energy and time scales are different for both classes of objects , the underlying physics is probably very similar .",
    "the internal shock scenario@xcite has been used to explain the variability of blazars@xcite and grbs:@xcite inhomogeneities in the outflow cause different parts ( shells ) to collide and produce the internal shock waves .",
    "the dissipation originated at such shocks has been studied by means of relativistic ( magneto)hydrodynamic simulations@xcite in non-/weakly magnetized outflows , and has shown the complexity of shell interactions , not taken fully into account by simpler analytic models.@xcite    these studies did not address the highly magnetized regime of shell interactions , particularly , they did not consider whether it is only kinetic or also the magnetic energy which can be used to power the emission . in a previous work@xcite",
    "we study the efficiency of conversion of the kinetic to thermal and magnetic energy ( we call it _ dynamic _ efficiency ) .",
    "the main results of that study show that 1 ) the dynamic efficiency is highest if the shells are moderately magnetized ( magnetization @xmath0 ) , 2 ) if the relative difference in magnetization between colliding shells is @xmath1 , the efficiency of a single collision can be as high as @xmath2% and 3 ) multiple shell collisions can raise the efficiency to even higher values ( close to @xmath3% ) .",
    "in this work we discuss some preliminary results of the upcoming paper@xcite on the _ radiative _ efficiency of the shell collisions .",
    "more precisely , we discuss the definitions of the efficiency and the radiative signature of strongly magnetized shell collisions .",
    "in our previous work@xcite , we define the dynamic thermal and magnetic efficiency ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively ) as a fraction of the total initial energy in the shells which is converted into an thermal and magnetic energy in the merged shell , respectively .",
    "we also defined the total dynamic efficiency as @xmath6 .",
    "the radiative efficiency @xmath7 can be defined as a fraction of the total initial energy in the shells converted into radiation .",
    "assuming that only a fraction @xmath8 of the thermal energy dissipated at the shock can be transferred to non - thermal particles and later radiated , we can write @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "the reason that we only take the thermal energy as being available for radiation is that we do not consider any magnetic dissipation processes ( ideal limit ) .",
    "( solid lines ) plotted over the dynamic efficiency distribution ( grey shades ) as a function of left ( faster ) and right ( slower ) shell magnetizations .",
    "the contours show @xmath11 in per cent with the values @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath2 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath3 . a value @xmath23 is considered . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : eff ] shows the contours of @xmath11 and the filled contours of @xmath24 as a function of the shell magnetization .",
    "we denote the faster and slower shells by the subscripts @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the shell lorentz factors are @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which corresponds to a typical blazar jet .",
    "it can be seen that , although the dynamic efficiency has its maximum in the region @xmath29 , there , the radiative efficiency is lower than for the weakly magnetized shells ( @xmath30 there , as opposed to @xmath31 when @xmath32 ) . the plot has been obtained using a grid of @xmath33 different values of @xmath34 pairs and then solving riemann problems using method described in our previous work@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : rad ] shows the light curves for two models , @xmath35 ( full lines ) and @xmath36 ( dashed lines ) . shown",
    "are the optical ( thick lines ) and x - ray ( thin lines ) light curves .",
    "( full lines ) and @xmath37 ( dashed lines ) . ]",
    "the method for the computation of emission will be described in our upcoming article@xcite , and is very similar to the ones already used to study multiwavelength light curves from non - magnetized shell collisions@xcite .",
    "we take into account the synchrotron and the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) processes .",
    "the optical radiation is dominated by the synchrotron process , while the x - ray radiation is dominated by the ssc .",
    "once the shocks cross the shells the optical emission peaks and drops afterward , while the ssc emission peaks at later times because of the delay caused by the travel time of the seed synchrotron photons , which are scattered to x - ray frequencies .",
    "the difference between the non - magnetized ( full lines ) and the magnetized model ( dashed lines ) is both in the intensity of the emitted radiation , as well as in the shape of the light curve .",
    "the magnetized model optical light curve is almost constant until the sharp drop - off , corresponding to the point when the shocks cross the shells . due to the high magnetic field",
    "the electrons are fast cooling and the radiation drops very soon after the shocks stop accelerating fresh particles . in the non - magnetized case",
    "the magnetic field is low enough that the electrons are slow cooling and the light curve peaks when the shocks cross the shell , and then decays gently as the electrons cool .",
    "the ssc emission from the magnetized model is much lower than the one from the non - magnetized one due to the lower density of the scattering electrons ( both models have the same total energy , but in the magnetized case a substantial part of the energy is carried by the magnetic field , while in the non - magnetized case all the energy is in the baryons ) .",
    "we studied the radiative efficiency and the radiative signature of the collisions of arbitrarily magnetized shells in the variable outflow of blazars and grbs .",
    "our results are preliminary , but they show that , while the dynamic efficiency in magnetized outflows can be higher , the radiative efficiency ( at least in the internal shocks model ) is probably much lower .",
    "the multi - wavelength light curve also shows substantial differences between the two cases , notably in the shape of the optical light curve .",
