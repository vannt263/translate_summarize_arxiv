    "the cosmic acceleration was discovered in 1998 @xcite , and it has been confirmed by several independent observations . the standard @xmath2cdm model provides a succinct description of the cosmic acceleration matching current cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations @xcite . besides the cmb measurements , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurements are recognized as robust and independent probes of cosmology , since they provide a standard ruler for studying the cosmic expansion .",
    "recently , @xcite reported a detection of the bao feature in the flux - correlation function of the ly@xmath4 of high - redshift quasars from the data release 11 ( dr11 ) of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) @xcite of sdss - iii @xcite . by adopting the value of sound horizon at the drag epoch @xmath5 mpc from the planck+wp fitting of the concordance cosmology ,",
    "@xcite derive a high - redshift hubble parameter @xmath6 km / sec / mpc .",
    "as the measurements of @xmath0 parameter at different redshifts are statistically independent , they are suitable for studying the evolution of the cosmic geometry . with these high - redshift @xmath0 data , @xcite test the cosmological constant hypothesis by employing the evolution of @xmath0 according to the recent observations of bao s in sdss dr9 @xcite and dr11 @xcite .",
    "by adopting an improved version of the @xmath7 diagnostic , @xcite find that there is considerable tension with the planck+wp measurements in the framework of the standard @xmath2cdm model . by the @xmath7 diagnostic ,",
    "the @xmath8 value is independent of the redshift if dark energy is a constant .",
    "however , they find that @xmath9 , while the planck result is @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2cdm model is in conflict with the hubble parameter measurement at redshift @xmath3 , at the level of two standard deviation .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate this tension through joint data analysis instead of the @xmath8 diagnostic , in order to compare the significance of these high - redshift bao data with that of the planck data .",
    "for comparison , we use the same @xmath0 dataset of @xcite , including the hubble constant from local distance ladder ( @xmath11 km / sec / mpc @xcite ) , the hubble parameter from anisotropic clustering of sdss dr9 ( @xmath12 km / sec / mpc @xcite ) and the new @xmath0 data from the @xmath13 forest of sdss dr11 quasars ( @xmath14 km / sec / mpc at @xmath3 @xcite ) .    as we noted above , the high - redshift hubble parameter @xmath15 is derived by scaling at a @xmath16 from the planck+wp measurements , so the value of @xmath15 is correlated with the planck+wp dataset . to avoid this correlation",
    ", we also adopt the most precisely determined combination from @xcite , namely    @xmath17    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are defined as @xmath20 } { \\left[d_h(\\bar z)/r_d\\right]_{\\rm fid } } \\hspace*{3mm}{\\rm and}\\hspace*{5 mm } { \\alpha_\\perp}= \\frac { \\left[d_a(\\bar z)/r_d\\right ] } { \\left[d_a(\\bar z)/r_d\\right]_{\\rm fid } } ~ , \\label{eq : alpha}\\ ] ] where the fiducial values @xmath21_{\\rm fid}$ ] and @xmath22_{\\rm fid}$ ] at @xmath23 are 8.708 and 11.59 respectively . for the sdss dr9 dataset , the result that @xmath24 obtained by @xcite will be used . for a further comparison",
    ", we also employ the improved @xmath25 measurements of sdss dr11 dataset , which gives @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite respectively .    in the following context",
    ", we will use `` h0 '' , `` hz '' , `` dr9 '' , `` dr11'',``dr11ly@xmath4 '' , and `` planck+wp '' to represent the hubble constant , the three @xmath0 data , @xmath28 of sdss dr9 , @xmath29 and @xmath28 of sdss dr11 , @xmath30 of sdss dr11 at reshift @xmath3 and the planck+wp dataset respectively . for convenience , we will use `` sdss '' to represent the combination of `` hz '' , `` dr9 '' , `` dr11 '' and `` dr11lya '' datasets .    with these datasets ,",
    "we perform @xmath31 analysis and explore the parameter space using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm by modifying the cosmomc package  @xcite .",
    "table [ table1 ] and table [ table2 ] summarize the fitting results of the parameter constraints ( the 68% cl limits ) and corresponding @xmath32 s . in figure [ fig1 ] , in order to make a comparison , we plot the likelihood distributions of @xmath33 with two different selections : the hz and planck+wp datasets ( corresponding the upper panel ) ; the dr9 , dr11 and planck+wp datasets ( corresponding the below panel ) .",
    "[ table1 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xcite show that the estimation of the new diagnostic @xmath8 from sdss dr9 and dr11 data gives @xmath34 , having tension with the value @xmath35 determined for @xmath2cdm from planck+wp at over @xmath36 . from table",
    "[ table1 ] and the upper panel of figure [ fig1 ] , we can see that the hz and the planck+wp give constraints @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively , which means the hz dataset does have tension with the planck+wp dataset at over @xmath36 . however , when using the hz+planck+wp and h0+h(z=0.57)+planck+wp datasets , the constraints are @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "apparently , they are both consistent with the constraint of planck+wp dataset .",
    "table [ table2 ] and the lower panel of figure [ fig1 ] show the constraints with the corresponding dr9 , dr11 , dr11ly@xmath4 and planck+wp datasets .",
    "when we use the @xmath28 measurement of sdss dr9 in place of the hubble parameter @xmath41 , the tension is alleviated , this is because the measurement of @xmath41 of @xcite includes the anisotropic information of galaxy clustering while dr9 measurement of @xcite does not .",
    "thus the constraint on @xmath33 of @xmath41 is tighter than dr9 measurement . for a further comparison",
    ", we replace the dr9 data @xmath24 with the improved measurements @xmath42 and @xmath43 of dr11 data , the constraint becomes a little tighter , but the tension is still alleviated when compared with the constraint by @xmath41 data .",
    "an obvious feature can be seen from both table [ table1 ] and table [ table2 ] , that is the contribution to @xmath32 s is mainly dominated by the planck+wp data .",
    "these @xmath32 s just change relatively small values by adding these sdss data .",
    "the results reveal that the high - redshift bao data is of less importance compared with the planck+wp data on constraining the standard @xmath2cdm model .    for the @xmath2cdm model , the best - fit ( black line ) and 2@xmath44 constraints ( filled region ) of the reconstructed evolution of @xmath0 constrained by the hz+planck+wp data",
    "are plotted in figure  [ fig2 ] respectively .",
    "the three @xmath0 data points with their error bars are marked as well .",
    "we find that the @xmath0 value given by high redshit bao data deviates from the reconstructed 2@xmath44 region of @xmath0 constrained by the hz+planck+wp dataset .",
    "we notice that there are similar features described in @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the results shown in figure  [ fig1 ] : the difference between the constraints by planck+wp data and that by combining with other sdss datasets is not much .",
    "so the constraints of @xmath33 are also mainly dominated by the planck+wp data .",
    "we conclude that the significance of these high - redshift bao data is less than that of the planck data .",
    "@xmath45 \\includegraphics[scale=0.48 , angle=0]{planck.pdf } \\end{array}$ ]",
    "using only the sdss data , the contribution to the hubble parameter constraint is mainly dominated by the @xmath15 data . however ,",
    "when we combine the sdss and the planck results , the fitting is found to be mostly influenced by the low redshift @xmath0 data and the planck data , so the @xmath2cdm model looks fine .",
    "these results indicate that the single high redshift measurement of @xmath0 is at variance with other data , in order to see whether dark energy does evolve , we need more independent measurements of the hubble parameter at hight redshifts .    ml is supported by the national natural science foundation of china ( grant no . 11275247 , and grant no .",
