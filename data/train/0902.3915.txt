    "at the time when string theory was investigated as a theory of strong interactions , there was a contemporaneous area of research into mechanical models for quarks or partons as attempts at understanding hadrons in terms of composite systems .",
    "it went under labels such as  infinite component wave equations  ,  bi - local field theory  and  dynamical groups  ( see old reviews in @xcite and recent comments in @xcite ) .",
    "today , the correspondence between quantization of mechanical systems and field theory is of course well known and often provides useful tools for formulating both free field theories and interactions .",
    "parts of this old work could be of relevance to the higher spin interaction problem .    investigating this question is the motivation behind the present work .",
    "i will review one particular approach @xcite that indeed produced cubic higher spin vertices quite some time before the higher spin gauge interaction problem per se came into focus .",
    "based on this work i propose an algorithm for generating @xmath0-vertices between massless higher spin states .",
    "let it also be said that this is very much work in progress and it is described as it was at the time of the 4-th eu rtn workshop in varna , 11 - 17",
    "september 2008 .",
    "i plan to return to this topic and treat it more thoroughly elsewhere .",
    "we think of a mechanical system consisting of two point particles with coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 or equivalently center of mass @xmath3 and relative coordinates @xmath4 defined by @xmath5    canonical momenta are @xmath6 , @xmath7 or center of mass and relative @xmath8 , @xmath9 with @xmath10    for the phase space @xmath11 we have the oscillator transcription ( dimension carried by the parameter @xmath12 ) @xmath13    in terms of these phase space variables we know what the correct first class constraints should be in order to arrive at an infinite tower of higher spin gauge fields .",
    "the constraints are @xmath14    spanning the simple algebra @xmath15=2g_0,\\ ] ]    with all other brackets zero .",
    "the brst charge q that results from this theory is of course precisely the one that produces an infinite tower of gauge fields with actions unified in @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "we can consider the @xmath16 setup as simply a practical mnemonic for deriving the fronsdal free field equations .",
    "if , however , we want to base some kind of space - time picture for the interactions , it would seem that we need an underlying space - time mechanical model .",
    "the general constraint structure of models of this type is simple but can be organized in several different ways . excluding explicit @xmath17 ,",
    "there are three more bilinear constraints to consider @xmath18    quantum ordering ambiguities can only arise for @xmath19 .    by choosing different subsets of these constraints , and different linear combinations",

    "it is reducible in the sense that we are not removing the double traces @xmath21 of the gauge fields and the corresponding traces of the gauge parameters @xmath22 .",
    "effectively this means that we allow the propagation of lower spin fields .",

    "this system is very interesting .",
    "it was investigated by casalbuoni , dominici and longhi @xcite in the mid 1970 s .",

    "gauge invariance is of course lost since these transformations are otherwise generated by the @xmath31 and @xmath32 constraints .",
    "a system of this kind was analysed in @xcite .",
    "it results from discretising the bosonic string into two end - point particles .",
    "discretising into more than two particles ( corresponding to more than one oscillator ) yield several trajectories .",
    "it is indeed quite remarkable that such an extremely simple constraint structures as in case i and ii above is sufficient to reproduce all of the fronsdal spin @xmath33 actions .",
    "this simplicity is however somewhat deceptive when we try to extend the theory to include interactions .",
    "we simply do nt have enough structure to support interactions .",
    "the only guiding principle is to extend gauge invariance to all orders in the fields .",
    "this tells us that the gauge algebra is a strongly homotopy lie algebra , but not much more @xcite .    turning then to cases iii and",
    "iv , where the essential point is that @xmath26 is a constraint , we fix the spin to a certain value @xmath27 .",
    "the actions and field equations stay the same .",
    "physically interpreted , the model now describes physical oscillators , not just practical mnemonics .",
    "this extra structure allows us to write down an algorithm that generates higher spin vertices .",
    "the model of @xcite corresponds to a rigid motion of the string ( also called",
    " straight line string  in the literature ) with lagrangian in terms of center of mass @xmath17 and relative @xmath34 coordinates @xmath35    a careful dirac analysis of this action reveals two branches of linear combinations of the constraints , one corresponding to massless states and one corresponding to massive states ( recently investigated in @xcite ) .",
    "this makes physical sense .",
    "the relative coordinate oscillations yield massless states , while the rotations yield massive states . here",
    "we will focus on the massless states .",
    "the massive branch is equivalent to the two - particle discretised string of @xcite ( case v above ) .",
    "we are then interested in harmonic oscillator states @xmath36 which we write for short as @xmath37 . in brst - lagrangian higher spin theory these states are used as a basis for classical higher spin fields @xmath38 .",
    "the configuration space states corresponding to the fock space states are @xmath39    generalising the generating function @xmath40 $ ] for one - dimensional non - relativistic oscillator states and inserting a factor for the ground state wave function @xmath41 $ ] and a suitable normalisation @xmath42 , the configuration space states are given by partial derivatives with respect to the sources @xmath43 @xmath44{\\partial^{(n)}\\over \\partial^{\\mu_1}\\ldots\\partial^{\\mu_n}}\\exp[(-j^2 + 2j\\cdot\\xi)/\\kappa^2]\\big|_{j=0}.\\ ] ]    the functions @xmath45 serve equally well as a basis for the higher spin gauge fields .",
    "indeed we can write @xmath46",
    "let us review the casalbuoni - dominici - longhi cubic vertex and then generalise to higher order vertices .",
    "consider then two bi - particle systems like the ones described above colliding to produce a third .",
    "it is natural to consider end - point collisions , for instance a @xmath47 colliding with a @xmath48 .",
    "consider therefore the picture describing the three - vertex .",
    "we denote the end - point coordinates with @xmath49 with @xmath50 and the collision points with @xmath51 all taken at a common time @xmath52 .",
    "conventionally we consider all the states participating in the collision as being incoming .",
    "there is a natural cyclic symmetry on the integers labeling the incoming states .",
    "it is obvious how to generalise to an @xmath0-vertex .",
    "we work with incoming states @xmath53 of definite momentum and spin represented by @xmath54 .",
    "the model is gauge fixed so there are no mechanical ghost degrees of freedom ( this restriction eventually have to be lifted ) .",
    "the natural overlap conditions are coordinate continuity , which in the notation of the figure amounts to @xmath55    the first quantised vertex operator is ( up to numerical and dimensional factors ) @xmath56 yields @xmath57    next using the overlap conditions we get ( and similarly for the @xmath58 ) @xmath59f(z_{12}),\\ ] ]    with @xmath60    the vertex function thus become @xmath61\\times\\\\\\nonumber \\exp\\big[{1\\over\\kappa^2}[-{1\\over2}(z_{12}^2+z_{23}^2+z_{31}^2)-(j_1 ^ 2+j_2 ^ 2+j_3 ^ 3)+2(j_1\\cdot z_{12}+j_2\\cdot z_{23}+j_3\\cdot z_{31})]\\big].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    performing the integrations we get up to numerical and dimensional factors @xmath62-{\\kappa^2\\over6}(p_1 ^ 2+p_2 ^ 2+p_3 ^ 2)\\big].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as noted , the @xmath63 s can be thought of as sources for the higher spin states .",
    "so performing partial derivatives with respect to various combinations of @xmath63 s , and then setting them to zero , we get expressions for particular spin states interacting . for instance , computing @xmath64    results in the yang - mills vertex @xmath65 .",
    "now it is quite clear that this scheme can be generalised to an algorithm for computing  candidate ",
    "interactions to any order and any spin .",
    "i say  candidate  since it remains to show consistency of the resulting interactions .",
    "let us outline the algorithm for arbitrary vertex order @xmath0 in a simplified notation .",
    "thus let @xmath66 and @xmath63 denote a set of @xmath0 incoming momenta @xmath67 and corresponding sources @xmath68 .",
    "we write the vertex generating function @xmath69 as @xmath70 $ ] where @xmath71    and where the indices @xmath72 include also space - time indices",
    ". formally we sum from 1 to @xmath0 but we keep in mind that @xmath19 and @xmath73 are really combinations of the metric @xmath74 and kronecker @xmath75 depending on the vertex order .",
    "the precise form of @xmath76 follows from generalising the construction for cubic interaction in the previous section to an @xmath0-vertex and performing the integrations over the @xmath0 end - point overlap coordinates @xmath77 .",
    "this will result in a generic expression of the form ( [ eq : vertexdelta ] ) .",
    "thus , the vertex order @xmath0 is implicit and will show up in the actual form of the @xmath19 s and @xmath73 s .",
    "vertices for various combinations of fields are extracted from @xmath69 by performing appropriate partial derivatives and setting the sources to zero .",
    "the following formulas are useful ( numerical factors are ignored ) @xmath78    putting this scheme to work for the spin 1 cubic vertex we get @xmath79\\big|_{j_i=0}=(n_{12}q_3+n_{23}q_1+n_{31}q_2+\\kappa^2 q_1q_2q_3)\\exp(\\kappa^2 p^2).\\ ] ]    remembering that the @xmath19 s are combinations of spacetime metrics @xmath80 and the @xmath81 s of spacetime metrics @xmath80 and momentum factors @xmath66 , we see that we reproduce the yang - mills cubic vertex when the @xmath82-terms are expanded .",
    "the @xmath83 terms with combinations of three momentum factors is expected to occur @xcite .",
    "such higher derivative interactions ( in this case for spin 1 ) has been found @xcite and corresponds to the spin 1 fields that accompany the spin 3 fields in cases where the tracelessness constraints are nt imposed ( case i above ) .    in this way",
    "we can compute arbitrary order vertices for arbitrary combinations of massless fields and it is clear that we get the correct overall momentum powers .",
    "much remain to be done however .",
    "the vertices are covariant but field theoretically they correspond to a definite choice of field redefinitions .",
    "we have to understand how to check gauge invariance to all orders , something which presumable requires introducing mechanical ghosts and the concomitant brst - machinery .",
    "a crucial calculational test is to compare to the spin 3 cubic vertex of @xcite .",
    "this , scheme , if it can be shown to be consistent with gauge invariance to all orders , holds out the hope of providing a systematic method of obtaining higher spin vertices .",
    "some fairly simple organizing structure to the interactions is precisely what is lacking .",
    "i hope to return to these issues elsewhere .",
    "i would like to thank bo sundborg for discussions we had almost twenty years ago , the notes of which i found useful to return to when writing up the present work",
    ". unfortunately the ideas did nt quite jell at that time .",
    "too many pieces of the puzzle were still missing ."
