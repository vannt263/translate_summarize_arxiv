    "the title compounds @xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ( @xmath4 tb , dy , ho ) are three of the most well studied realizations of geometrical frustration  @xcite .",
    "they support a long running experimental and theoretical quest for understanding of an apparently highly frustrated state when none is expected ( @xmath4 tb ) , and the canonical examples of the spin ice state  @xcite with attendant emergent magnetic monopole excitations ( @xmath4 dy , ho )  @xcite .",
    "little is known about their lattice dynamics , though these are of potential importance for different reasons . in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ,",
    "the formation of the low temperature state is accompanied by numerous anomalies in elastic properties  @xcite , and , most recently , the hybridization of magnetic and lattice excitations has been advanced as a source of the fluctuations required to melt long - range magnetic order  @xcite . in the spin ices ,",
    "the monopole excitations must hop by reversing large single - ion magnetic moments  @xcite , and mechanisms involving interaction between crystal field states and phonons could well play a role  @xcite .",
    "thus far , the interaction of a crystal field level with a transverse acoustic phonon has been documented in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  @xcite , but since the relatively low symmetry of the rare earth site ( @xmath5 ) splits the ground state terms of the tb@xmath6 , dy@xmath6 and ho@xmath6 into several levels that are spread over a similar total bandwidth to that typical of acoustic and optical phonons , further interactions may well be possible .",
    "a prerequisite for the understanding of such processes is to know the energy and symmetry of phonon modes which may be involved .",
    "investigations of pyrochlore - structured materials using electronic structure calculations have mainly been related to their potential applications as host materials to deposit actinides  @xcite , and as thermal barrier coating materials due to their surprisingly low thermal conductivity at high temperatures  @xcite . for the former ,",
    "first - principles calculations were used in the study of defect formation in the pyrochlore structure , while for the latter thermodynamic properties were simulated using both the molecular dynamics method  @xcite and _ ab initio _",
    "calculations  @xcite . for both applications",
    ", it was found that pyrochlore zirconates are generally favorable over titanates , hence more theoretical investigations on the lattice dynamics of zirconates have been carried out . in the pyrochlore titanates , available calculations of the phonon spectrum",
    "are limited to the @xmath7-point , where the energies and symmetries of phonons have previously been predicted  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the lattice dynamics of both titanate and zirconate pyrochlores were measured using the @xmath8 sensitive raman scattering @xcite and infrared absorption techniques @xcite , but neither could confirm the existence of the low - lying optical phonon modes that were thought to be responsible for the low thermal conductivity of pyrochlore materials at elevated temperatures @xcite .    here",
    "we use density functional calculations to predict the entire phonon band structure of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "spectroscopic techniques with finite momentum transfers such as inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) and inelastic x - ray scattering ( ixs ) are needed to determine the phonon dispersion relations across the brillouin zone in a single crystal , or to collect neutron - weighted powder averages of the phonon density of states ( phonon dos ) , and these techniques are then used to validate our calculations and symmetry assignments .",
    "we find good agreement with our model throughout the brillouin zone . by comparing the experimentally determined phonon dos in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , and ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2",
    ", we find that the phonon frequencies evolve only gradually across the series , and so our dispersions and symmetries may be taken as a good guide for understanding excitations in other nearby compounds such as yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  @xcite . after introducing our computational ( [ sec : computational_methods ] ) and experimental ( [ sec : experimental_methods ] ) methods ,",
    "the paper presents detailed results concerning structural relaxation ( [ sec : relax ] ) and the calculation of the phonon band structure ( [ calc_phonons ] ) ; the verification of these predictions by inelastic neutron scattering ( [ sec : ins_cryst ] and [ sec : ins_pow ] ) , and inelastic x - ray scattering ( [ sec : ixs ] ) ; followed by discussion ( [ sec : discussion ] ) and conclusions ( [ sec : conclusion ] ) .",
    "sample parameters and calculated lattice heat capacities of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 can be found in the appendix .",
    "readers interested only in general features of the phonon band structure of rare earth titanates will find an overview of the dispersion relations and partial phonon dos of ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 in fig .",

    "[ fig : theory_pphdos ] respectively , and a tabulation of energies and symmetries of zone center phonons in table  [ tab : phonon_symmetries ] .",
    "we have applied density functional theory within the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) @xcite parametrized generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) optimized for solids ( pbesol ) @xcite using the plane - wave basis projector augmented wave ( paw ) @xcite method as implemented in the vasp code @xcite .",
    "the energy cutoff of the plane - wave basis was checked for convergence of the structural parameters and subsequently fixed to 550ev .",
    "the electronic potentials of the ions were approximated by paw gga pseudo - potentials using the electronic valence contribution @xmath9 for the rare earths , @xmath10 for titanium and @xmath11 for oxygen .",
    "the @xmath12-electrons of the rare earth ions were frozen into the core states , an approach which was used previously @xcite and proven not to affect the results of phonon calculations  @xcite .",
    "the primitive reduced unit cell containing 22 atoms ( see fig .  [",

    "the total energy was minimized until the differences in the total forces were smaller than @xmath15ev /  .",
    "the atom positions and volume of the reduced unit cell were relaxed at both ambient and applied external pressures to obtain the equilibrium structures .",
    "the phonon calculations for the two rare earth titanates tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 were carried out using the finite displacement method as implemented in the phonopy code  @xcite . distorted atomic configurations in a @xmath16 supercell containing 176 atoms were generated and the induced forces were calculated by using vasp , with the same precision as employed for the structural relaxation .",
    "the atomic displacement amplitude of 0.01 was verified to give forces that depend linearly on the displacements .",
    "the static dielectric tensor and born effective charges were calculated using density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) as implemented in vasp .",
    "using phonopy , non - analytical term corrections were applied to the dynamical matrix at @xmath17 and interpolated to general @xmath18 according to the interpolation scheme by wang _",

    "the total and partial phonon densities of states were evaluated on a @xmath19 @xmath7-centered mesh ( whose size was tested for convergence ) using the parlinski - li - kawazoe fourier interpolation scheme  @xcite and smeared with a gaussian of width @xmath20  mev .",
    "the lattice heat at constant volume was calculated from the total energy of the phonon bath in the harmonic approximation using a sampling mesh of size @xmath21 , which yielded a convergence of better than @xmath22 at the lowest temperatures .",
    "we investigated the phonon density of states using inelastic neutron scattering experiments on powders .",
    "the samples were prepared from stochiometric ratios of the oxides ho@xmath1o@xmath23 , dy@xmath1o@xmath23 or tb@xmath24o@xmath2 , and tio@xmath1 in a solid state reaction .",
    "the oxides , with 99.99% purity , were annealed at 850 c for 10 hours , then mixed and ground , and heated at 950 - 1300 c for 140 hours with several intermediate grindings .",
    "the structures were verified by combined neutron and x - ray diffraction experiments , which were carried out on hrpt  @xcite at sinq , psi and the materials science beamline ( msb )  @xcite at the sls , psi .",
    "rietveld refinement of the structures ( results tabulated in appendix  [ appendix : characterization ] ) as implemented in the fullprof  @xcite software proved all samples to be of high quality and single phase .",
    "inelastic neutron time - of - flight measurements on the powder samples of ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 were performed on the merlin spectrometer at isis @xcite .",
    "the samples ( each of mass @xmath25 g ) were packed in envelopes of aluminum foil which were curled up to form an annular cylinder with diameter and height of 40 mm .",
    "subsequently , the samples were sealed into aluminum cans containing helium exchange gas , and cooled by a closed - cycle refrigerator on the instrument .",
    "different settings with incoming neutron energies of @xmath26 and @xmath27mev , and corresponding chopper frequencies of @xmath28 , and @xmath29hz were chosen to record data at @xmath30 and @xmath31k for @xmath32@xmath33amp hrs ( @xmath34 hours at isis full power ) each .",

    "the thickness of the sample was carefully controlled so as not to exceed 0.5 mm , to optimize the inelastic signal despite the large absorption cross section of natural dysprosium .",
    "4seasons was operated in repetition rate multiplication mode  @xcite . using a fermi chopper frequency of 250 hz",
    ", the phases of the other choppers were configured so that for a single source pulse , spectra were recorded for @xmath36 mev .",
    "measurements were taken at @xmath37 k , for 8 hours .",
    "the detector pixel efficiency was calibrated using a vanadium standard sample .",
    "the instrumental background was measured to subtract the significant contribution from scattering due to phonons of the aluminum sample can from the raw data  @xcite .    for the experimental determination of the phonon dos ( @xmath38 ) in the incoherent approximation , we used data collected on merlin ( @xmath39 tb , ho ) with incoming neutron energies @xmath26 and 150mev and on 4seasons ( @xmath39dy ) with @xmath40mev .",
    "the low energy ( le ) setting was chosen to exploit the better instrumental resolution at lower incoming energies and resulting energy transfers , while the high energy ( he ) setting covers the entire spectrum of incoherent one - phonon scattering .",
    "the scattered neutron intensity is integrated over scattering angles @xmath41 ranging from 60 to 80 degrees ( he ) , or 85 to 135 degrees ( le ) , of which the latter was only accessible on merlin . by integration over the scattering angle",
    "we evaluate the neutron - weighted phonon density of states from the same @xmath42-range measured on the two instruments ( which do not have identical detector coverage ) . magnetic contamination from strong crystal field excitations",
    "is excluded by carefully limiting the integration to sufficiently large @xmath41 angles . for each setting , the ( incoherent ) elastic line was removed and replaced by a debye extrapolation below 12 mev in the he setting and 4.5 mev in the le setting  @xcite .",
    "multiphonon and multiple scattering were removed from the signal up to fourth order using the iterative scheme of sears _ et al . _",

    "the scaled multiple scattering contribution is found to be close to parity with the multiphonon sum . from the resulting one - phonon scattering profile , @xmath38",

    "neutron measurements of the acoustic phonon dispersion relations in ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals were performed on the thermal triple - axis neutron spectrometer eiger at the swiss neutron spallation source sinq .",
