    "recent _ chandra _ observations of the galactic center region ( e.g. , wang , gotthelf & lang 2002 , hereinafter wgl02 ; muno et al . 2003 , hereinafter mm03 ) have led to a renewed interest in the understanding of compact stellar x - ray sources . both of these long exposure surveys have revealed a great number of x - ray point sources with luminosities , @xmath2 ergs s@xmath1 and spectra which can be fit by an absorbed power law .    although the nature of these low luminosity sources is unknown ,",
    "several possible interpretations have been proposed . in particular ,",
    "muno et al . (",
    "2004 ) suggest that the intermediate polar subclass of magnetic cataclysmic variables may dominate the faint population characterized by luminosities less than @xmath3 ergs s@xmath1 and a photon power law index ranging between 0 and 1 . among models involving accreting neutron stars ( ns ) ,",
    "pfahl , rappaport & podsiadlowski ( 2002 , hereinafter prp02 ) explored the hypothesis that wind - fed neutron star systems with intermediate and massive main sequence ( ms ) donors ( @xmath4 ) may account for the majority of sources with @xmath5 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the contributions from a population of pre - low mass x - ray binaries in which the neutron stars accrete from the wind of low mass ms companions ( @xmath6 ) has also been studied by bleach ( 2002 ) and willems & kolb ( 2003 ) . however , it was recently pointed out by popov ( 2003 ) that the neutron stars in this lower mass binary population may not necessarily accrete all the transferred material , implying that only a fraction of these types of systems would be continuous x - ray emitters . among the non stellar models that have been proposed ,",
    "bykov ( 2003 ) has suggested that the faint hard sources result from the interaction of fast moving supernova ejecta fragments with the dense interstellar medium of the galactic center region .",
    "these sources , due to their low intrinsic brightness , may only contribute to the deeper mm03 survey .",
    "the aforementioned stellar studies focused on only wind - fed ns systems , however there are a number of rlof transient systems which , in quiescence , emit at x - ray luminosities very similar to those of the many point sources observed in the galactic center .",
    "specifically , transients with neutron stars in their quiescent state are observed to have x - ray luminosities in the range of @xmath7 ergs s@xmath1 ( see campana & stella 2003 ) , while transient systems with black hole ( bh ) accretors tend to be observed at lower luminosities of @xmath8 ergs s@xmath1 ( e.g. , tomsick et al .",
    "2003 ) in their inactive state .",
    "although many of the ns transient systems are characterized by soft spectra in their quiescent state and are difficult to detect from the galactic center region , some fraction have a power law component extending beyond 2 kev with luminosities in the range of @xmath9 ergs s@xmath1 ( see jonker , wijnands , & van der klis 2004 ) .",
    "such systems may have been detected in the deeper survey of mm03 .",
    "the systems with bh accretors are also known to emit at energies greater than 2 kev and may also contribute to the faint source population at this luminosity level .",
    "x - ray transient systems with large outburst to quiescent flux ratios are known to have either a ns or bh accretor and a predominantly low mass companion ( classified as a low mass x - ray binary , lmxb ) .",
    "the outburst phenomenon is generally believed to result from a thermal / viscous instability in an accretion disk surrounding the compact object . only those systems with mass transfer rates below a critical value ( e.g. , dubus et al .",
    "1999 ; menou , perna & hernquist 2002 ) can exhibit such transient behavior .",
    "in general , the donors of lmxbs are believed to be either low mass ms or giant - like stars .",
    "however , observations of ultra - short period lmxbs ( with orbital periods less than about 80 minutes ) , so called ultracompacts , have revealed that , at least , some of them must host very low mass ( @xmath10 ) white dwarf ( wd ) donors ( e.g. , markwardt et al .",
    "2002 , galloway et al . 2002",
    "; see also deloye & bildsten 2003 ) . in a recent study",
    "belczynski & taam ( 2004 ) showed that the population of lmxbs with low mass wd donors ( and thus with very low mass transfer rates leading to transient behavior ) may be more significant than previously anticipated .",
    "since the majority of transient sources are expected to be in quiescence due to the very low x - ray duty cycle , we suggest that a fraction of the low luminosity sources observed in the galactic center region may reflect a population of transient systems in their quiescent state , while the same systems in outburst may contribute to a bright source population .    a binary population synthesis model _ startrack _ ( presented in  2 ) is used to determine the number of x - ray binaries ( ns or bh accretor , wind - fed or rlof ) in the galactic center region .",
    "the entire mass spectrum of evolved and unevolved donors is considered . in particular ,",
    "low , intermediate , and high - mass ms stars are investigated to account for the systems considered in previous studies .",
    "the results of our studies are described in  3 and their implications are discussed in the final section .",
    "the _ startrack _ population synthesis code developed originally for the modeling of binaries with two compact objects ( belczynski , kalogera & bulik 2002 ) is used .",
    "this code has recently undergone major revisions ( belczynski et al . 2004 , in preparation ) , reflecting the new features associated with the improved treatments of the physical processes important for the formation and evolution of x - ray binary systems .",
    "specifically , the additions and revisions include a detailed treatment of tidal synchronization and circularization , individual treatment of various rlof mass transfer phases , and a full numerical orbit evolution with angular momentum losses due to magnetic braking ( mb ) , gravitational radiation ( gr ) , mass transfer / loss and tides .",
    "in contrast to population synthesis studies of other groups , we also include the possibility that neutron star formation can occur via an accretion induced collapse ( aic ) of a massive onemg white dwarf ( belczynski & taam 2004 ) .",
    "such white dwarfs in binaries form from stars within the mass range of @xmath11 ( belczynski & taam 2004 ; tauris & van den heuvel 2003 ; see also nomoto & hashimoto 1988 ) which is wider than for the formation of onemg cores in single stars ( @xmath12 ) due to tidal mass loss ( nomoto & kondo 1991 ) and rejuvention ( belczynksi & taam 2004 ) . the ability to accumulate matter on the white dwarf is enhanced , paradoxically , by the effect of an optically thick wind from the white dwarf surface , which can stabilize the mass transfer in the system at high mass transfer rates ( see kato & hachisu 1994 , hachisu , kato , & nomoto 1999 ) .",
    "the accumulation ratio of hydrogen - rich and helium - rich matter is taken from hachisu , kato , & nomoto ( 1999 ) and kato & hachisu ( 1999 ) respectively ( see also ivanova & taam 2004 ) . for the direct accretion of helium or carbon / oxygen matter onto the onemg white dwarfs we make use of the work of kawai , saio , & nomoto ( 1987 ) in determining the evolution of the accreting white dwarf .",
    "our population synthesis study of the galactic center should , therefore , be considered complementary to that of prp02 who did not consider the aic process nor rlof x - ray sources .",
    "the tidal effects have been calibrated using the observations of binary periods and eccentricities in several stellar clusters ( mathieu et al .",
    "1992 ) , recovering the orbital decay rate in high - mass x - ray binaries ( levine , rappaport & zojcheski 2000 ) .",
    "the _ startrack _",
    "rlof calculation involves the detailed calculation of the mass transfer rates based on radius - mass exponents calculated both for the donor stars and their roche lobes .",
    "the results of our calculations have been compared to a set of published rlof sequences ( e.g. , beer & podsiadlowski 2002 ) as well as to calculations obtained with an updated stellar evolution code ( ivanova et al .",
    "our approach to the mass transfer calculations allows for the possibility of ( i ) conservative versus non - conservative rlof episodes ( ii ) thermally driven rlof versus nuclear / mb / gr losses driven rlof and ( iii ) a separation of systems as persistent or transient depending on whether the donor rlof mass transfer rate lies below the critical rate for instability to develop in the accretion disk ( adopted from dubus et al . 1999 or menou et al .",
    "2002 for different compositions of transferred material ) .",
    "persistent x - ray emitters remain at a x - ray luminosity level corresponding to the secular rlof mass transfer rate .",
    "transient x - ray systems remain at very low luminosities for most of their lifetime , however , they exhibit outbursts with luminosities that can reach the eddington limit .",
    "we account for wind accretion onto compact objects following hurley , tout & pols ( 2002 ) with the wind mass loss rates adopted from hurley , pols & tout ( 2000 ) extended to include low mass and intermediate mass ms stars utilizing the formulae of nieuwenhuijzen & de jager ( 1990 ) .",
    "the wind velocities are assumed to be proportional to the escape velocity from the stellar surface with a normalization proposed by hurley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . for all wind - fed systems , we assume an orbit - averaged accretion rate .",
    "the flaring behavior associated with b_e _ stars and the periastron passage enhanced mass accretion onto the ns are not taken into account .    a large sample of single ( @xmath13 ) and binary ( @xmath13 ) stars in the galactic center",
    "are evolved for 10 gyrs assuming a constant star formation rate .",
    "we choose parameters from the reference model in belczynski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) with a few differences .",
    "specifically , the maximum ns mass is set equal to @xmath14 , and the most recently inferred natal ns kick distribution ( for nss formed by the core collapse of massive stars ) of arzoumanian , chernoff & cordes ( 2002 ) is incorporated . for cases in which ns formation occurs via the accretion induced collapse evolutionary channel ,",
    "no kicks are applied ( see belczynski & taam 2004 ) .",
    "however , we calculate one model in which we allow for the full kicks imparted to nss formed through aic , to assess the effect of our _ no aic kick _ assumption . in the primordial progenitor population ,",
    "the primary masses are selected in the range @xmath15 ( with an initial - mass - function slope of -2.7 ; see kroupa , tout & gilmore 1993 ) , and the secondary masses are selected in the range @xmath16 with a flat mass ratio ( secondary divided by primary mass ) distribution . in the rapid phases of binary evolution ,",
    "the accretion rate onto the ns and the bh is limited at the maximum eddington limit with the remaining transferred material lost with a specific orbital angular momentum of the accretor , but allowing for hyper - critical accretion in the common envelope ( ce ) phases ( e.g. , blondin 1986 ; chevalier 1989 ; brown 1995 ) .",
    "in addition to the dynamically unstable rlof mass transfer events leading to a ce phase , we also allow for evolution into the ce phase in the cases in which the trapping radius of the accretion flow exceeds the roche lobe radius of the accretor ( e.g. , king & begelman 1999 ; ivanova et al .",
    "2003 ) . finally , in comparison with our previous study",
    ", we have assumed that all systems that enter a ce phase with the donor in the hertzsprung gap merge into a single star ( ivanova & taam 2004 ; belczynski & taam 2004 ) .",
    "the updated version of the code has been tested and used for a study of galactic ultra compact binaries ( belczynski & taam 2004 ) , galactic young black hole populations ( belczynski , sadowski & rasio 2004 ) and used to reproduce the x - ray luminosity function of the nearby starburst galaxy ngc 1569 ( belczynski et al .",
    "in our study only accreting binaries with ns and bh primaries , which are brighter than @xmath17 ergs s@xmath1 are considered .",
    "the secondaries in these x - ray binaries may lose material either through a stellar wind or via rlof . in the latter case , the donors transfer all the material toward the accretor , whereas for the wind - fed systems only a fraction of the material is captured by the compact object . for every accreting system the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath18 ) is calculated based on the secular average mass accretion rate ( m@xmath19 ) as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is gravitational constant , @xmath22 is the mass of the accretor , @xmath23 is the radius of the accretor ( 10 km for a ns and 3 schwarzschild radii for a bh ) , and @xmath24 gives the conversion efficiency of gravitational binding energy to radiation associated with accretion onto a ns ( surface accretion @xmath25 ) and onto a bh ( disk accretion @xmath26 ) .    to determine the simulated x - ray luminosities of our population synthesis , we note that very little of the transferred material is accreted for transient systems during their inactive state . the spectra of neutron stars during this state consist of a soft blackbody component and a hard power law component with a tendency for a larger contribution from the power law component for sources characterized by lower quiescent luminosities ( jonker et al .",
    "2004 , see also tomsick et al .",
    "the soft component is described by energies of @xmath27 kev ( see campana & stella 2003 ) .",
    "the theoretical models based on deep crustal heating associated with pycnonuclear reactions ( brown , bildsten , & rutledge 1998 ; colpi et al . 2001 ) can provide an understanding of the black body - like nature of the spectrum and the observed emission level ( @xmath28 ergs s@xmath1 ) without necessarily invoking the accretion of matter . however , short term variability during the quiescent state in aql x-1 ( rutledge et al .",
    "2002 ) and in cen x-4 ( campana et al .",
    "2004 ) has also been observed , suggesting that accretion of matter may be occurring in aql x-1 and cen x-4 ( asai et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ; campana et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ; campana 2004 ) .",
    "the accretion rate during this phase is likely to be at a low level since the inferred luminosities above 2 kev are @xmath29 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "in contrast to the majority of transient systems in quiescence , the spectral energy distribution of the millisecond accreting x - ray pulsar , sax j1808.4 - 3658 , is dominated by a hard component with a luminosity of @xmath30 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "such a nonthermal component may arise from synchrotron emission in a shock front produced by the interaction of a relativistic pulsar wind with matter from the companion star ( tavani & arons 1997 ; campana et al .",
    "based on these observational results , we adopt @xmath31 ergs s@xmath1 as a lower limit for the hard x - ray luminosity , above 2 kev , for transient ns systems in quiescence , recognizing that the average luminosity level can be higher @xmath32 ergs s@xmath1 ( e.g. , rutledge et al . 2001 ; rutledge 2002 ; see jonker et al . 2004 ) . due to the lack of a definitive theory for the hard x - ray emission component of transient systems in quiescent",
    ", we take a semi empirical approach for the quiescent ns transients and adopt an x - ray luminosity level of @xmath0 ergs s@xmath1 above 2 kev .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the quiescent ns transient x - ray luminosities are evenly distributed in the above range .",
    "the quiescent emission from bh transient systems , on the other hand , is likely related to a low level of mass accretion .",
    "in contrast to the ns transient systems , the spectra are typically harder and are not described by a black body .",
    "observations of the 14 black hole transient systems for which the quiescent emission has been obtained reveal luminosities in the range from @xmath33 ergs s@xmath1 with a median luminosity of @xmath34 ergs s@xmath1 ( see tomsick et al .",
    "2003 ) . as for the ns transient systems",
    "a semi empirical approach is adopted for the bh transient systems .",
    "in particular , we assume that most ( 80% ) of the quiescent bh transient x - ray luminosities above 2 kev are evenly distributed in the @xmath35 ergs s@xmath1 range , while the rest ( 20% ) of the systems are slightly brighter : luminosities evenly distributed in the @xmath36 ergs s@xmath1 range ( see fig . 3 of tomsick et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "transient rlof systems in outburst are bright x - ray sources , with luminosities corresponding to a fraction ( @xmath37 ) of the critical eddington luminosity .",
    "the long period systems , with orbits that are sufficiently extensive for a large accretion disk to be formed , are usually found to emit at the eddington luminosity ( @xmath38 ) during outburst , while the outburst luminosities of short period systems are lower by about an order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , we apply an x - ray luminosity correction factor at outburst corresponding to @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the short and long period systems respectively",
    ". the critical periods , over which the eddington luminosity is adopted , are taken to be 1 day and 10 hrs for ns and bh transients in outburst respectively ( chen , shrader & livio 1997 ; garcia et al .",
    "2003 ; t. maccarone , private communication ) .    for the persistent sources ( both rlof and wind - fed ) and all transients in the outburst stage , where accretion is the dominant contributor to the observed luminosity",
    ", we apply a correction factor , @xmath41 , to the bolometric luminosity to account for the fraction of energy emitted above 2 kev . for different types of systems",
    "one may expect corrections of the order of 0.1 - 0.5 .",
    "however , for clarity and comparison with previous studies the same correction is applied to all the sources within the limits @xmath42 , with @xmath43 chosen as a standard value .",
    "therefore , we can obtain the simulated x - ray luminosity ( [ @xmath44 ) from : @xmath45 where @xmath46 represents the eddington luminosity .",
    "the simulated x - ray luminosity distributions of both wind - fed and rlof - fed systems with ns and bh accretors are illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "the rlof - fed systems dominate the overall x - ray population at luminosities greater than @xmath47 ergs s@xmath1 with most of the systems lying within the range of @xmath48 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "the majority of these rlof systems are transient x - ray sources in quiescence formed through the aic scenario presented in belczynski & taam ( 2004 ) .",
    "the number of x - ray systems ( 435 of rlof - fed and 56 of wind - fed sources ) were calibrated to represent the galactic center population in the mm03 survey and are also listed in table 1 ( for details see  3.4 ) .    in table 1 the relative frequencies for various types of systems categorized by their donor and accretor found in our simulation are listed .",
    "as expected from the examination of figure 1 , the rlof - fed systems dominate ( @xmath49% ) the population .",
    "the majority of these systems are ns transient sources in quiescence with typical luminosities of @xmath50 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "most of the rlof - fed systems have low - mass wd donors with the mass transfer rates of @xmath51 leading to transient behavior through a long lived ( @xmath52  gyr ) phase ( for details see belczynski & taam 2004 ) . over half of the systems belong to the ultra - short period lmxb class with orbital periods below 2 hrs ( 60.7% ) , while the remaining rlof - fed binaries ( 27.9% ) are characterized by longer periods extending beyond one month .",
    "a small , but significant fraction of wind - fed systems ( @xmath53% ) are found , mostly with low - mass ( @xmath54 : 7.9% ) and intermediate - mass companions ( @xmath55 : 3.3% ) . however , there is no statistically significant population of systems found with massive ( @xmath56 ) companions ( hmxbs ) .",
    "most of the wind - fed systems are ns - ms binaries , however several have an evolved ( red giant ) donor , and a few have a bh accretor . for the wind - fed systems , most are characterized by eccentric orbits with the most massive donors possibly exhibiting a b_e _ x - ray binary phase , although we do not follow orbit - dependent accretion .",
    "our x - ray population will remain confined to the galactic center region since the spatial velocities induced as a result of the mass loss and nascent kick velocities accompanying ns / bh formation are small compared to their mean spatial velocities in this region . in particular , the average velocities acquired are @xmath57 km s@xmath1 for both the wind - fed and rlof mass transferring systems .",
    "they are significantly smaller than the velocities of @xmath58 km s@xmath1 characteristic of the stellar motions in this region .",
    "we point out that the velocities calculated for the rlof mass transferring systems only refer to a minor subgroup ( 71 out of 435 systems , see table 1 ) that have undergone a core collapse supernova since the majority of these systems are formed via the aic mechanism with no nascent kick .",
    "the low velocities are a direct consequence of the use of the recent ns kick distribution of arzoumanian et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .      to determine the sensitivity of the results to the major uncertainties of the binary evolution",
    ", we have recalculated several models with different choices of evolutionary parameters .",
    "in particular , a model with a reduced efficiency of the ce ejection of @xmath59 ( in the standard model @xmath60 ) was simulated ; for details see belczynski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in this case , the number of ns / bh x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) in the galactic center is significantly decreased ( 109 ) , with the relative number of wind - fed to rlof - fed systems remaining comparable to the standard model .",
    "the sensitivity of the model simulation to the assumed mass ratio distribution was also studied .",
    "specifically , a model in which both masses were drawn independently ( as opposed to correlated initial masses for the two binary components via a flat mass ratio distribution in the standard model ) was calculated .",
    "this led to an increase in the number of systems which enter and merge in the ce phase , decreasing the number of ns / bh xrbs in the galactic center ( 296 ) and lowering the importance of rlof - fed systems relative to wind - fed systems ( 245 rlof - fed systems compared to 51 wind - fed systems ) .",
    "this decrease in the number of xrbs for the above two models provides an indication of the influence of the uncertainties associated with our treatment of the ce evolution phase ( for details see belczynski & taam 2004 ) .",
    "since the stellar wind mass loss rates are somewhat uncertain , an additional model with the stellar wind mass loss rates reduced by a factor of 2 for all mass losing stars was calculated .",
    "the smaller wind mass loss rates have two opposing tendencies on wind - fed systems .",
    "first , there is an obvious decrease of the mass accretion rate , and thus a decrease in the number of wind - fed x - ray systems above certain critical value of @xmath61 .",
    "second , the systems tend to be tighter , due to the fact that less mass is carried away ( jeans mode of mass loss ) . therefore , the fraction of matter lost in the wind that is captured increass , leading to a tendency for an increase in the accretion rate .",
    "the latter effect dominates over the former , and there is an overall increase in the number of wind - fed systems ( 82 ) as compared to the standard model ( 56 ) .",
    "the number of rlof - fed systems is not greatly affected ( 416 ) .    a model in which we use the full natal kicks ( arzoumanian et al .",
    "2002 ) for nss formed via aic as opposed to no aic kicks in the standard model was also calculated . in this model",
    "wind - fed systems are not affected , however a number of rlof systems progenitors are disrupted at the formation of the ns .",
    "additionally , many of the surviving rlof systems formed in aic acquire high ( @xmath62 ) systemic speeds , exceeding the escape velocity from the galactic center ( but still bound to the galaxy ) .",
    "this follows from the result that the aic channel occurs , in general , for systems at short orbital periods ( where the components orbit about their common center at high velocities ) , and the systems which survive can acquire a significant additional systemic speed ( comparable to the component s orbital velocity ) . the total number of ns / bh xrbs decreases to 201 , while the relative contribution of wind - fed sources in the x - ray population significantly increases ( see fig .",
    "3 ) as compared to the standard model .",
    "an additional model , without tidal binary component interactions , was calculated to compare the results to the other studies . in this model",
    ", we find the highest number of wind - fed sources ( 87 ) in the simulations and a slight decrease of rlof - fed systems ( 387 ) in comparison with our standard model calculation . in the absence of tidal interaction , the orbital expansion associated with transfer of spin angular momentum to the orbit",
    "does not take place and the x - ray binary progenitors are generally found in shorter period orbits . for the tightest systems ( progenitors of rlof sources )",
    "this leads to more frequent mergers in ce episodes ( decreasing the formation rates ) . on the other hand",
    ", the absence of tidal effects leads to tighter orbits for wider systems ( the progenitors of wind - fed sources ) and , therefore , to brighter systems resulting from higher wind capture rates , increasing their number in the studied sample .",
    "in particular , the x - ray luminosities of wind - fed sources can exceed @xmath63 ergs s@xmath1 for intermediate mass x - ray binaries . in this calculation ,",
    "similar to the standard model , the number of hmxbs is negligible , as expected for the small sampled volume corresponding to the mm03 survey .",
    "we also relaxed our assumption on the bolometric correction , and recalculated the ns / bh system x - ray luminosities with @xmath64 ( no bolometric correction ) . as expected ( see eq .",
    "2 ) , only the brightest sources in rlof class ( either persistent or transients in outburst ) are affected , with @xmath61 extending to @xmath65 ergs s@xmath1 . since the wind - fed systems are brighter ( by the factor of ten ) , the number of wind - fed sources increases to 80 as additional systems are brighter than our adopted critical threshold luminosity ( @xmath47 ergs s@xmath1 ) .    throughout our study",
    "we have allowed for the possibility of accretion induced collapse of a heavy wd to a ns .",
    "the specific arguments and new input physics supporting aic was presented and discussed in detail by belczynski & taam ( 2004 ) . as an indication of its importance ,",
    "we examine the implications of its neglect on the results of our study .",
    "the primary effect is a decrease in the number of ns / bh x - ray sources to 126 ( as compared with 491 in standard model , see also table 1 ) .",
    "this decrease results in a significant depletion of rlof population ( 71 ) , while wind - fed sources would remain virtually unchanged ( 55 ) . in this model",
    "the majority of rlof systems are found with long periods ( 45 ) , but some systems are still found within ultrashort period class ( 26 ) . as a result ,",
    "the number of transients and the number of bright sources decrease .",
    "the shape of the x - ray luminosity distribution is not significantly altered , although the relative contribution of wind - fed to rlof - fed sources is increased .",
    "notwithstanding the models with rather extreme assumptions on accretion induced collapse ( full natal kicks applied during ns formation in the aic process and a model in which aic is not allowed ) the rlof - fed ns / bh xrbs are found to be more numerous than their wind - fed counterparts by more than a factor of 2 . for comparison ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity distributions for the most extreme model assumptions are shown in figures  2 and 3 .",
    "note the change of vertical scale between different plots .",
    "for all of the models most systems are found at low luminosities ( @xmath66 ergs s@xmath1 ) , with several bright systems usually found at ( @xmath67 ergs s@xmath1 ) .",
    "although the shape of the distribution is very similar , the number of sources and the ratio of wind - fed sources to rlof sources may change significantly from model to model .      the total mass contained in stars corresponding to our simulation with @xmath13 massive binaries ( primary component more massive than @xmath68 )",
    "can be estimated based on the three component broken law of kroupa et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . by extending our simulation mass range to @xmath69 and including a 50% contribution due to single stars",
    ", we estimate the total mass to be @xmath70 .",
    "as based on the recent mass model by launhardt , zylka , & mezger ( 2002 ) , this is comparable to the stellar mass in a cylindrical radius of 20 pc and a depth of 440 pc centered on the galactic center ( muno et al .",
    "we note , however , that the stellar mass would be overestimated by a factor of 5 if the mm03 survey corresponded to a sphere of radius 20 pc .",
    "our results ( table 1 , also previous subsections ) can also be applied to the wgl02 survey by taking into account that the larger field is about 4 times more massive than modeled in our population synthesis . in our standard simulation",
    "it is found that there are @xmath71 and @xmath72 ns / bh x - ray binaries with luminosities @xmath73 ergs s@xmath1 ( see table 1 ) for the mm03 and wgl02 fields , respectively . however , the majority of the synthetic ns / bh accretion sources are expected to be characterized by low x - ray luminosities ( @xmath74 ergs s@xmath1 ) in the hard x - ray band ( see figure 1 , 2 and 3 ) . we note that many of our simulated sources can have a significant soft component with higher luminosities ( see discussion in the  3.1 ) .",
    "the majority ( @xmath71 ) of the galactic center sources discovered in the wgl02 survey were characterized by @xmath75 ergs s@xmath1 and hard spectra . in our standard model calculation",
    ", there are no statistically significant sources in that luminosity range . however , in the model with no bolometric correction applied ( @xmath64 ) , 44 sources in that range are found , all of which are wind - fed systems .",
    "this simply reflects the fact , that all of the wind - fed systems found at @xmath76 ergs s@xmath1 in the standard model , are shifted to the higher luminosities with @xmath64 .",
    "in addition , for the models with altered assumptions on aic ( either full aic kicks or aic not allowed ) the number of wind - fed systems ( amounting to the same as for the standard model ) dominate over rlof - fed binaries in this specific luminosity range .",
    "although these systems are promising candidates for the unidentified x - ray population , it is likely that they represent a small fraction ( @xmath77% ) of the observed sources in wgl02 survey .",
    "our results suggest that other sources , and not the accretion powered ns / bh binaries constitute the majority of point sources in the wgl02 survey .    in the deeper survey of mm03",
    "a faint source population of 2079 point sources , characterized by @xmath78 ergs s@xmath1 was discovered .",
    "the spectra of these sources were fit to an absorbed power law with photon index , @xmath79 .",
    "the majority of these sources is described by hard spectra @xmath80 ( 1427 ) , with an important subpopulation characterized by softer spectra @xmath81 ( 652 ) .",
    "we note that the majority of our synthetic xrbs have luminosities in a range very similar to these found for point sources in mm03 with a significant number of these systems corresponding to ultrashort period rlof - fed ns - wd binaries . due to the very low mass transfer rates in these binaries ,",
    "the sources are expected to be transient and would most likely be observed during their quiescent state at low luminosities .",
    "muno et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggest that the faint hard source population ( @xmath80 ) can be consistent with magnetic cataclysmic variable systems .",
    "it is suggested that the transient rlof - fed ns - wd transients in quiescence studied in this paper may contribute to the faint population characterized by softer spectra .",
    "for the bright systems , 15 xrbs are found in our simulated population of the mm03 field .",
    "these sources are characterized by luminosities @xmath82 ergs s@xmath1 and are rlof persistent and rlof transient systems in outburst .",
    "however , only a few bright transients have been observed in the field of the mm03 survey ( m.muno , private communication ) , suggesting that the simulation leads to an overproduction of such systems ( see  4 ) .    for the wgl02 field",
    ", our standard model calculation shows @xmath83 x - ray sources brighter than @xmath84 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "most of these systems in our simulation are persistent x - ray sources .",
    "however , only @xmath77  bright sources were observed ( wgl02 ) with most as transient systems in outburst in the galactic center .",
    "this suggests that the parameters intrinsic to our standard model affecting the bright population require modification . for the alternative models ( full aic kicks , lowered ce efficiency , reduced stellar winds and aic not allowed ) it is found that number of the bright sources is reduced to less than @xmath85 .",
    "we note that the number of transient sources exceeds the number of persistent sources only for the simulation with reduced stellar winds .    to account for the entire bright galactic field xrb population",
    "we increase the above number by factor of @xmath86 , yielding @xmath87 bright systems ( 4000 persistent and 2000 transients in outburst ) .",
    "this is an overestimate , since only 150 of these systems are observed .",
    "this overproduction of bright systems is common to all our models ( including the neglect of aic ) and the other studies of the rlof x - ray sources in the galaxy ( e.g. , pfahl , rappaport , & podsiadlowski 2003 ) and implies an overproduction of the bright population in the galactic center as well .",
    "we note that the overproduction may not be as great for the faint population since the relative number of faint to bright sources can change from model to model .",
    "in particular the number of bright sources decreases by a factor of 5 , whereas the number of faint sources is relatively unchanged for a model with reduced stellar winds .",
    "willems & kolb ( 2003 ) estimated the number of pre - lmxbs with main sequence companions less than about @xmath14 in the galaxy .",
    "their number may be directly rescaled to the smaller expected population in the galactic center , yielding @xmath88 sources for the wgl02 survey field ( b.willems , private communication ) .",
    "since the study of willems & kolb ( 2003 ) assumes no bolometric correction , we use our model with no bolometric correction for comparison . in this case",
    "we expect @xmath89 wind - fed low - mass x - ray binaries ( pre - lmxbs ) , a number which is consistent with the willems & kolb ( 2003 ) findings .",
    "if the bolometric correction was applied , the expected number of pre - lmxbs with luminosities @xmath90 erg s@xmath1 would decrease by a factor of @xmath91 .    a direct comparison with prp02 is not easily accomplished since",
    "the initial input ( e.g. , imf , eccentricities ) and treatment of the rlof phases as well as model assumptions ( e.g. , natal kicks ) differ . despite the model differences",
    ", it is found that the numbers of wind - fed systems predicted by prp02 and in the present study for the wgl02 survey can be comparable ( see below ) .",
    "in addition the x - ray luminosity distributions show that the majority of the synthetic wind - fed sources of both studies are characterized by rather low - luminosity @xmath92 ergs s@xmath1 ( although we are unclear about the adopted choice for the bolometric correction in prp02 ) .",
    "the primary difference stems from the fact that the wind - fed sources in our study are characterized by low- and intermediate - mass ms companions , while prp02 accounted only for the wind - fed sources with either intermediate- or high - mass companions .    in the present study the intermediate mass x - ray binaries ( imxbs )",
    "greatly dominate over hmxbs , in contrast to that found by prp02 .",
    "in fact , prp02 obtain in their model k2 about equal numbers of hmxbs and imxbs .",
    "this arises from their specific choice of kick scenario , which favors the survival of hmxbs .",
    "we prefer to use the observationally derived distribution of kicks ( arzoumanian et al .",
    "2002 ) . with the use of rather standard kick velocity distribution ( model k1 ) , the prp02 calculation results in the dominance of imxbs over hmxbs ( by a factor of about 5 - 10 ; as one can infer from the middle panel of their figure 1 ) .",
    "this result is already comparable to the results obtained in the present study .",
    "moreover , there is an additional factor which lowers the number of hmxbs as compared to imxbs within our population synthesis model . specifically ,",
    "prp02 use a constant escape wind speed independent of mass ( or spectral type ) .",
    "however , it is known that this speed depends on a mass of star ( e.g. lamers , snow & lindholm 1995 ) . for the mass range used in our study",
    "it varies by about an order of magnitude .",
    "the capture rate ( and thus resulting x - ray luminosity of wind fed system ) depends strongly on this velocity .",
    "the higher the wind velocity , the smaller the capture rate and the lower the x - ray luminosity . in our simulation the most massive stars have wind speeds as high as 5 times the escape speed ( lamers et al .",
    "1995 ) , while prp02 considers wind speeds not greater than twice the escape speed .",
    "this effect results in a smaller number of bright x - ray binaries with massive companions ( hmxbs ) as compared to prp02 study .    for the wgl02 survey field",
    "prp02 obtain a total of 250 and 600 wind - fed neutron star systems with main sequence companions more massive than @xmath93 for their kick models k1 and k2 .",
    "the number of prp02 systems is reduced due to the detection limit appropriate for wgl02 survey ( @xmath94 ergs s@xmath1 ) by a factor of 2.5 for a wind speed equal to the escape velocity or by a factor of 20 for a wind speed equal to twice the escape velocity .",
    "this leads to a reduction in the number of systems in the prp02 k1 model from 250 to 12 - 100 systems in the wgl02 field .    since the k1 kick distribution of prp02 ( a single maxwellian with @xmath95 km s@xmath96 ) is comparable to the present study ( bimodal distribution with 40% kicks with @xmath97 km s@xmath1 and 60% with @xmath98 km s@xmath1 - arzoumanian et al .",
    "2002 ) , we compare our results with the results from model k1 .",
    "our total number of wind - fed sources ( standard model ) for wgl02 field is 224 ( see table 1 ; note an increase by factor of 4 for the wgl02 field ) . in the following",
    "we give the different corrections factors in order to compare our results to that obtained by prp02 .",
    "first in the model with no bolometric correction ( assumed to be the case in prp02 ) we expect a greater number of wind - fed sources ( 320 ) . of these , only a 44 have luminosities in excess of @xmath3 ergs s@xmath1 . those systems with ms companions which are more massive than @xmath93 amounts to 32 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the overall number of wind fed neutron star systems systems in prp02 study for model k1 is in approximate agreement with the results obtained in our study for similar model assumptions . however , prp02 increase the number of wns by using their alternative kick model ( k2 ) , which can reproduce the entire population of x - ray sources in the wgl02 field .",
    "the population of low luminosity x - ray binaries in the galactic center region has been investigated within the framework of a population synthesis technique .",
    "although it has been found that this population may be more heterogeneous than previously predicted , our results suggest that accreting neutron star systems are not likely to be the major contributor to the faint x - ray source population in the galactic center .",
    "the rlof systems investigated in this paper provide an additional low luminosity component .",
    "many of these additional systems are composed of neutron stars with white dwarf companions in ultra - short orbital periods ( @xmath99  hrs ) in which mass is transferred at rates ranging from @xmath100 as a result of the action of angular momentum losses associated with gravitational radiation . because the mass transfer rates are low , these systems are expected to exhibit transient quiescent / outburst behavior . for a small duty cycle of @xmath101  1%",
    "it is expected that most of these sources would be found in their quiescent state with x - ray luminosities in the range of @xmath102 erg sec@xmath1 .",
    "the population of hard x - ray sources ( @xmath103 erg sec@xmath1 ) discovered in wgl02 survey was interpreted in the context of wind - fed ns - ms binary systems ( prp02 ) .",
    "we find that such systems can be a contributor to the x - ray population in this luminosity range provided that @xmath104 .",
    "however , our results can not explain the entire population since the predicted number of such systems ( @xmath105 ) is much lower than the number of observed sources ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "the deeper mm03 exposure revealed a large population of faint ( @xmath66 erg sec@xmath1 ) point sources .",
    "the majority of these sources are characterized by hard spectra , and are too numerous to be explained by wind - fed ns / bh systems and too hard to be explained by rlof - fed ns / bh systems .",
    "muno et al .",
    "2004 have suggested that the intermediate polar class systems can explain both their spectral properties and their observed number .",
    "the nature of the population characterized by softer spectra is unknown , although a number of candidates have been proposed . we have found that the number of rlof - fed ns / bh transient systems in quiescence could be as high as 400 in comparison to",
    "the 652 observed , but this leads to an overproduction of bright lmxbs in the galaxy .",
    "the sensitivity of our results to input parameters have been explored , which can lead to a reduced contribution of rlof sources and to an overall reduction in the number of synthetic soft ns / bh x - ray sources to a level further below that observed in mm03 survey .",
    "the identification of the faint soft x - ray sources will be essential for confirming their nature .",
    "such studies may be fruitfully carried out in the low extinction regions near the galactic center where the contribution from the low energy component of their spectra ( corresponding to less than 1 kev ) may be detectable . at these lower energy ranges ,",
    "the x - ray luminosities of our proposed candidates could be as high as @xmath76 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "the chandra and hst surveys of baade s window have been carried out ( grindlay et al . 2003 ) , and the forthcoming results may have bearing on the importance of this population .",
