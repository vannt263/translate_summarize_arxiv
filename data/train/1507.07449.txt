    "for over a century , co - orbitals or minor bodies trapped in a 1:1 mean motion resonance with a host planet have been regarded as mere interesting dynamical curiosities ( jackson 1913 ; henon 1969 ; namouni 1999 ) .",
    "this view is now changing considerably ; in fact , the heliocentric 1:1 co - orbital resonance could be an efficient mechanism for capture of satellites by a planet and therefore explain the origin of some irregular moons ( kortenkamp 2005 ) .",
    "this theoretical possibility that of being a feasible dynamical pathway to capture satellites , at least temporarily was dramatically vindicated when a co - orbital of the earth , 2006  rh@xmath2 , remained as natural satellite of our planet for about a year starting in 2006 june ( kwiatkowski et al .",
    "2009 ; granvik , vaubaillon & jedicke 2012 ) .",
    "uranus has one of the smallest known populations of co - orbitals and all of them are relatively short - lived ( de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2014 ) .",
    "so far , uranus had only three known co - orbitals : 83982 crantor ( 2002 go@xmath3 ) ( gallardo 2006 ; de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2013 ) , 2010 eu@xmath4 ( de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2013 ) , and 2011  qf@xmath5 ( alexandersen et al . 2013 ; de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2014 ) . due to its present short data - arc ( 85 d )",
    ", 2010 eu@xmath4 is better described as a candidate .",
    "asteroids crantor and 2010 eu@xmath4 follow horseshoe orbits , and 2011  qf@xmath5 is an l@xmath6 trojan .",
    "consistently , uranus has also a small population of irregular satellites , significantly smaller than that of jupiter or saturn ( grav et al .",
    "2003 ; sheppard , jewitt & kleyna 2005 ) .",
    "most uranian irregular satellites are retrograde and their large spread in semimajor axis suggest that they formed independently ( nesvorn et al .",
    "2003 ) ; orbits with inclinations in the range ( 80 , 100 ) are unstable due to the kozai resonance ( kozai 1962 ) . for the particular case of uranus trojans , dvorak , bazs & zhou ( 2010 ) have also found that the stability depends on the orbital inclination and only the inclination intervals ( 0 , 7 ) , ( 9 , 13 ) , ( 31 , 36 ) , and ( 38 , 50 ) seem to be stable .",
    "asteroid 2011  qf@xmath5 appears to inhabit one of these stable islands at an inclination of nearly 11(de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2014 ) .",
    "the stability of uranian trojans had been previously studied by marzari , tricarico & scholl ( 2003 ) , and by nesvorn & dones ( 2002 ) and holman & wisdom ( 1993 ) before them .    here , we present a recently discovered object , 2015  db@xmath0 , that is also trapped in a 1:1 mean motion resonance with uranus .",
    "this minor body exhibits some dynamical features that separate it from the previously known uranian co - orbitals .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly discuss both the data and the numerical model used in our calculations .",
    "the topic of generating control orbits compatible with the available observations and its implications is considered in section 3 .",
    "the current status of 2015  db@xmath0 is studied in section 4 , where its dynamical past and future orbital evolution are also investigated .",
    "section 5 discusses our results and their possible significance .",
    "the stability of the co - orbital realm located in the neighbourhood of 2015  db@xmath0 is tentatively explored in section 6 .",
    "a summary of our conclusions is given in section 7 .",
    "asteroid 2015  db@xmath0 was discovered on 2015 february 27 at mt .",
    "lemmon survey . with a value of the semimajor axis @xmath7 = 19.20 au",
    ", this centaur moves in an eccentric , @xmath8 = 0.32 , and highly inclined path , @xmath9 = 3772 .",
    "with such an orbit , close encounters are only possible with uranus as its perihelion is well beyond saturn s aphelion and its aphelion far from neptune s perihelion .",
    "it is a relatively large object with @xmath10 = 8.3 mag which translates into a diameter in the range 46145 km for an assumed albedo of 0.400.04 .",
    "its period of revolution around the sun , approximately 84.16 yr at present , is very close to that of uranus which is suggestive of an object that moves co - orbital with the giant planet .",
    "its current orbit is statistically robust because six precovery images acquired by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) at apache point late in 2003 have been found .",
    "the heliocentric keplerian osculating orbital elements and uncertainties in table [ elements ] are based on 28 observations for a data - arc span of 4200 d and they have been obtained from the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) small - body database .    0.30truecm",
    ".heliocentric keplerian orbital elements of 2015  db@xmath0 used in this research .",
    "the orbit is based on 28 observations spanning a data - arc of 4200 days or 11.50 yr , from 2003 october 21 to 2015 april 23 .",
    "values include the 1@xmath11 uncertainty .",
    "the orbit is computed at epoch jd 2457000.5 that corresponds to 0:00 ut on 2014 december 9 ( j2000.0 ecliptic and equinox ) and it is @xmath12 in the figures .",
    "source : jpl small - body database . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ discovery ]",
    "it could be debated that arguing on the existence of a population of high orbital inclination uranian co - orbitals based solely on the discovery of 2015  db@xmath0 is an exercise of mere speculation . in order to investigate this interesting hypothesis further",
    ", we have studied the evolution of a sample of 10@xmath13 fictitious bodies with initial orbits similar to that of 2015  db@xmath0 .",
    "their orbital elements have been generated using uniformly distributed random numbers in order to survey the relevant region of the orbital parameter space evenly . for each test orbit , a numerical integration for 10@xmath14 yr using the same physical model and techniques applied in previous sections has been performed .",
    "the average value ( bottom panels ) of the resonant angle , @xmath15 , and its standard deviation ( top panels ) as a function of the initial values of the orbital parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 is plotted in figs [ ala][ila ] , respectively .",
    "the assumed ranges in @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are displayed ; @xmath16 and @xmath17 are chosen in the range 0360 .",
    "an object following a strict passing orbit has an average value of the resonant angle close to 0and its associated standard deviation is nearly 104(also displayed on the top panel of the figures as a dashed line ) ; the value of the variance of a continuous uniform distribution of maximum value @xmath18 and minimum value @xmath19 is given by the expression @xmath20 , and the mean value is @xmath21 . consistently with our analysis of the dynamics of 2015  db@xmath0 in which recurring co - orbital episodes of various types are observed , the fictitious orbits studied here show values of the standard deviation of the resonant angle in obvious conflict with those expected in a non - librational scenario . therefore , there is a robust theoretical ground to assume that such population of high orbital inclination uranian recurring co - orbitals may exist .    , as a function of the initial value of the semimajor axis . the value of the standard deviation for a continuous uniform distribution of maximum value 180and minimum value @xmath22180is also indicated , @xmath23104 .",
    "]     but for the initial value of the eccentricity . ]",
    "but for the initial value of the inclination .",
    "]    figure [ ila ] shows that the initial value of the orbital inclination does not have a major impact on @xmath24 or @xmath25 ( for the ranges of the values of the orbital elements considered here ) , but fig .",
    "[ ela ] indicates that the initial value of the orbital eccentricity has a major influence on the subsequent evolution of the test orbit . for values in the range 0.10.3",
    "the magnitude of the standard deviation of the resonant angle tends to be significantly lower when recurring co - orbital behaviour appears .",
    "these orbits are inherently more stable as their perihelia and aphelia are less directly perturbed .",
    "they are associated with trojan and quasi - satellite co - orbital states .",
    "returning to the issue of the actual extension of the uranian co - orbital zone for these high - inclination , transient but recurring co - orbitals , the distribution in semimajor axis ( the initial value ) for test orbits with @xmath26 ( top panel ) and outside that range ( bottom panel ) is plotted in fig .",
    "[ alast ] .",
    "the distribution clearly shows that the co - orbital region approximately goes from 19.0 to 19.4 au . outside that range in semimajor axis , most trajectories become passing orbits . however , even deep inside uranus co - orbital zone not all the values of the semimajor axis are equally favourable regarding stability .",
    "figure [ alast2 ] shows the distribution for the average value of the semimajor axis .",
    "the extension of the co - orbital zone is confirmed , but those orbits with values of the osculating semimajor axis in the range 19.119.2 au are far more stable .    , in the range",
    "100108(likely passing orbits , top panel ) and outside that range ( bottom panel ) . out of 10@xmath13 orbits studied , 346 have @xmath27 . ]     but for the average value of the semimajor axis . ]",
    "although the previous analysis strongly suggests that 2015  db@xmath0 is not a statistical accident and that more temporary uranian co - orbitals must exist at high orbital inclinations , our relatively short and non - extensive integrations appear to leave the question of long - term stability open .",
    "can we expect that objects moving in high - inclination orbits like that of 2015  db@xmath0 will spend 10 or 100 myr trapped in the 1:1 mean motion resonance with uranus ?",
    "figs [ drift ] and [ drift2 ] suggest an answer in the affirmative . in order to study the variation over time of a given orbital parameter ,",
    "we have computed the absolute value of the difference between the initial and final values of the parameter and divided by the integrated time .",
    "figure [ drift ] shows these drifts in @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 per myr .",
    "it is obvious that , taking into account the span of the co - orbital zone , relatively long - term stability is possible .",
    "figure [ drift2 ] shows the average values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 as a function of the drift in @xmath7 .",
    "from there , the most stable test orbits are found for the ranges in @xmath28 and @xmath29 of 19.019.6 au and 0.150.35 , respectively .",
    "the range in @xmath28 appears to be somewhat in conflict with the values found above , but there is an additional type of co - orbital motion that does not require libration of the resonant angle : minor bodies following passing orbits with small jacobi constants but still moving in unison with a host planet as described by namouni ( 1999 ) .",
    "this orbital regime is also known as the kozai domain because it corresponds to a kozai resonance ( kozai 1962 ) . under the kozai resonance , both eccentricity and inclination",
    "oscillate with the same frequency but out of phase ; when the value of the eccentricity reaches its maximum the value of the inclination is the lowest and vice versa ( @xmath30 constant ) ; therefore , relatively large oscillations in @xmath8 and @xmath9 are still compatible with long - term stability in this case .",
    "the most stable test orbit generated in our exploratory calculations could remain virtually unchanged for time - scales well in excess of 10 myr ( see fig .",
    "[ drift2 ] ) and it is not a classical ( librating ) co - orbital but a fictitious object in the kozai domain .",
    "the actual values of the semimajor axis , 19.2 au , and eccentricity , 0.32 , of 2015  db@xmath0 place this object in the most stable region of the orbital domain probed in fig . [ drift2 ] .",
    "if such orbits represent nearly 0.3 per cent of the ones explored in this section and one actual object has already been found , 2015  db@xmath0 , a significant number of less stable high - inclination , recurring uranian co - orbitals are likely to exist .",
    "in this paper , we have analysed the orbital behaviour of 2015  db@xmath0 that is the fourth known minor body to be trapped in a 1:1 mean motion resonance with uranus .",
    "our numerical integrations show that it currently moves in a complex , horseshoe - like orbit when viewed in a frame of reference corotating with uranus .",
    "the object exhibits resonance angle nodding as it undergoes recurrent co - orbital episodes with uranus .",
    "its high orbital inclination clearly separates this object from the other three known uranian co - orbitals and makes it more stable .",
    "its discovery circumstances also single this minor body out among objects currently trapped into the 1:1 commensurability with uranus , hinting at the presence of a large number of similar objects .",
    "if they are inherently more stable at higher inclinations , that should have an impact on the population of uranian irregular moons .",
    "all but one are retrograde and their orbital inclinations are in the range 139167or in prograde terms 4113 .",
    "five irregular moons out of 9 have inclinations in the range 139147 . as for the mechanism responsible for the activation of the co - orbital states , multibody mean motion resonances trigger the transitions as previously observed for other uranian co - orbitals .",
