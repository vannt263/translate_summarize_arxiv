    "we use the effective surface brightnesses and effective radii in the @xmath226- , @xmath227- , @xmath228- , and @xmath220-bands to compute the colors within apertures of 67  , used by faber et al . , which typically corresponds to @xmath229 at the distance of the coma cluster .",
    "the average colors are @xmath230 , @xmath231 , and @xmath232 .",
    "the coma galaxies are the only sample in the literature with k - band photometry suitable for this study .",
    "the fact that these are cluster galaxies , and not field galaxies as the galaxies in our distant sample are , does not limit the interpretation of our results .",
    "the differences between the two samples are reproduced through modeling their seds , adopting the relevant parameters which might differ ( such as age , sfh , and dust content ) as free parameters in the fit .",
    "the only assumption is that they have similar stellar populations in terms of imf and metallicity .      for our purpose",
    "we need stellar population models that provide synthetic spectra over a large wavelength range ( @xmath233 ) . in recent years , @xcite ( hereafter , bc03 ) and @xcite ( hereafter , m05 ) , have provided such spectra .",
    "m05 provide realistic spectra only up to @xmath234 , limiting our sed fitting range to the @xmath222-channel .",
    "this is not a severe limitation as the photometric errors in the two longest - wavelength channels are much larger than in the other two channels ( see table [ tab1 ] ) , and observed @xmath222 at @xmath0 corresponds to the reddest filter ( @xmath220 ) available for the nearby sample .",
    "significant differences between the models occur for all ages of interest for this study . for ages",
    "@xmath235 , the m05 model is much redder in the optical - to - nearir than bc03 , because of the very different implementation of the thermally - pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) phase . for ages older than  3 gyr ,",
    "the m05 model is bluer in optical - to - near - ir colors than the bc03 model because of the cooler red giant branch ( rgb ) stars of the padova tracks ( * ? ? ?",
    "* used by bc03 ) , with respect to those of the cassisi tracks ( * ? ? ?",
    "* used by m05 ) .",
    "m05 adopt the fuel consumption approach , and calculates luminosity contributions from different stellar types by the amount of fuel used during a certain evolutionary stage , whereas bc03 follow the isochrone synthesis approach , and characterize the properties of the stellar population per mass bin .",
    "we consider ssp models from m05 with solar and super - solar metallicity ( @xmath236 and @xmath237 ) and a salpeter imf with mass limits @xmath238 and @xmath239 ( these limits are used throughout the paper ) .",
    "for the bc03 model we also consider models with two different metallicities ( @xmath236 and @xmath240 ) and , in addition , a solar - metallicity model with a top - heavy , or flat imf with slope of @xmath241 ( instead of @xmath242 , which is the salpeter imf ) . the model with a flat imf",
    "has been shown to provide a better match to the evolution of @xmath3 in the optical and in the near - ir simultaneously @xcite .",
    "we do not consider imfs with different shapes at the low - mass end .",
    "the reason is that varying this shape changes all mass estimates by a constant factor . in other words ,",
    "the high- and low - redshift samples are affected similarly by the choice of parametrization of the low - mass end of the imf .    in figure [ models ]",
    "we show the spectra of the three bc03 models and the m05 model for ages of 0.5 , 1 , 2 , and 5 @xmath243 .",
    "the difference between the bc03 models with different metallicities , shown in the left - hand panel , is subtle , except for the longest wavelengths .",
    "the bc03 models with different imf slopes ( middle panel ) show much larger variation .",
    "this is primarily a difference in overall energy output , which is simply due to the larger numbers of giants in the case of a flat imf , especially at young ages .",
    "a secondary , but actually more interesting difference is the different evolution of the slope , i.e. , color , of the sed in models with different imfs .",
    "such differences in color evolution are also apparent when comparing the bc03 models to those of m05 , shown in the right - hand panel . for ages younger than @xmath244 ,",
    "the m05 model predicts much higher luminosities in the @xmath220-band than the bc03 model , whereas the optical luminosities are similar .",
    "the differences in color evolution are demonstrated more clearly in figure [ age_col ] . for ages older than 3 gyr",
    "the optical colors from different models agree well .",
    "for ages younger than that differences of up to 1 magnitude in @xmath245 occur between bc03 and m05 models with the same model parameters . for the near - ir differences",
    "occur for all ages and can increase up to 1.4 magnitudes in @xmath246 .",
    "we use redshifted model spectra to compute apparent magnitudes , @xmath247 , allowing the age ( and , optionally , the star - formation history ( sfh ) and the dust content ) to vary , and normalizing the calculated magnitudes to match the observed magnitudes , @xmath248 , to obtain the photometric mass .",
    "@xmath248 are the color magnitudes given in table [ tab1 ] , including a correction from fixed aperture magnitudes to total magnitudes as measured in the @xmath220-band .",
    "the resulting total fluxes are multiplied by 0.75 to match the aperture in which the dynamical mass is calculated ( see section [ dyn ] ) .",
    "the derived stellar mass includes the dark , compact remnants of massive stars , but not the gas lost due to stellar winds and supernovae ejecta .",
    "the best - fitting model is selected on the basis of the root mean square of @xmath249 ( @xmath250 ) , weighing with the inverse square of the photometric errors . a certain minimum error is assumed to avoid that the data points with the largest errors are effectively ignored in the sed fits . when the irac data are used in the fit , a minimum error of 0.10 mag",
    "is adopted .",
    "when the irac data are not used , we use 0.03 mag .",
    "the choices are based on the relative uncertainties in the photometric zeropoints of the different datasets .",
    "however , the precise value of the minimum error does not profoundly affect the fitting results for the samples as a whole    for the ssp models described in the previous section , there is a unique relation between color and age .",
    "subsequently , age determines @xmath3 , and thus @xmath251 .",
    "the differences between the models , discussed in the previous section and shown in figure [ age_col ] , will cause mass estimates derived from sed to differ .",
    "most notably , the different trends with age will cause systematic biases in mass estimates of young ( high-@xmath6 ) galaxies relative to old ( low-@xmath6 ) galaxies .    in figure [ rms ]",
    "we show , as an example , the fitting results for object cdfs-2 , using the ssp models . in the top panel",
    "we show how @xmath252 of the best - fitting bc03 model ( with solar metallicity and a salpeter imf ) changes if different wavelength ranges are used in the fit . in the bottom panel",
    "we show how the results vary from model to model , fitting the seds from @xmath217 to @xmath222 .",
    "@xmath252 of the best - fitting models vary by a factor of 3 , indicating the level of the systematic uncertainty in the photometric mass estimate .",
    "note that the quality of the fits is generally good : the @xmath250 of the best - fitting model is typically only @xmath253 mag .    to further illustrate our sed fitting method",
    ", we show in figure [ seds ] the seds of three @xmath0 early - types and two different , best fitting model spectra for each of those .",
    "those model spectra are the ssp models with solar metallicity and a salpeter imf of bc03 and m05 , which are fit to the @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath219 data - points , i.e. , the rest - frame optical .",
    "while similar in the rest - frame optical , the two models differ from each other in the rest - frame near - infrared .",
    "the bc03 spectrum predicts systematically lower flux levels than the m05 model .",
    "the @xmath220 , @xmath254 , and @xmath255 data - points agree better with the m05 model than with the bc03 model . as a consequence ,",
    "when we fit the @xmath217 through @xmath255 seds of these galaxies , the best - fitting age increases for the bc03 model in order to match the redness of the seds .",
    "no older ages are found when the m05 is used .",
    "this behavior is typical for the galaxies in our sample . as we will show in the subsequent sections ,",
    "whether or nor including the near - infrared in the sed fits has profound consequences on the resulting photometric mass estimates .",
    "in this section we compare photometric and dynamical mass estimates .",
    "we begin by fitting the rest - frame optical seds , as previous work has shown that a single rest - frame optical color like @xmath256 can be used well to estimate @xmath3 @xcite for the local sample we use the @xmath226- , @xmath227- , and @xmath228-bands in the fit , and for the distant sample we use @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath219 .",

    "as can be seen , @xmath251 and @xmath201 correlate well ; the scatter around the average @xmath329 is a factor of 1.50 for the local sample and a factor of 1.78 for the distant sample ( these and all other modeling results for the high-@xmath6 sample are summarized in table [ tab2 ] ) .    in order to investigate systematic effects ,",
    "we perform sed fits with different model parameters .",
    "we show the results for the high - redshift galaxies in figure [ mmmodels2 ] .",

    "thus , if imf and metallicity are unconstrained the average photometric mass of the high-@xmath6 sample is uncertain by at least a factor of 5 in an absolute sense .",
    "the differential @xmath3 from @xmath190 to @xmath191 is uncertain by a factor of 2.3 .",
    "now we explore the m05 models , using the same ages , metallicities and imf as for the bc03 models . in panel c of figure [ mmmodels2 ]",
    "we show the @xmath0 results if we adopt the m05 model with solar metallicity and a salpeter imf ( see also table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "we find that @xmath334 , which is significantly smaller than what was found for the bc03 model and also significantly smaller than zero : the normalized high-@xmath6 photometric masses are a factor of @xmath335 smaller than the dynamical masses .",
    "we find better agreement for the super - solar metallicity m05 model ( panel d of figure [ mmmodels2 ] ) : @xmath336 .",
    "the disagreement between the bc03 and m05 models implies a systematic uncertainty of a factor of 1.3 in the normalized high-@xmath6 mass estimates .",
    "this is much smaller than the uncertainty due to unconstrained metallicity and imf .",
    "the scatter in @xmath329 is similar to that obtained with the bc03 models ( a factor of 1.65 - 1.85 ) .",
    "to illustrate the results described above , we show in figure [ ml_col]a the relation between optical color ( @xmath245 ) and @xmath3 for the models and the observed galaxies .",
    "the bc03 models with a salpeter imf reproduce the colors and @xmath3 rather well , whereas the bc03 model with the flat imf and the m05 models do not .",
    "for the high-@xmath6 galaxies , the m05 model under - predicts @xmath3 , which explains that this model gives @xmath337 .",
    "we now extend the sed fits to the rest - frame @xmath220-band .",
    "the local galaxies are fit with the @xmath226- , @xmath227- , @xmath228- , and @xmath220-band photometry .",

    "similar to figure [ mmstandardopt ] , we show in figure [ mmstandard ] the results if we adopt the bc03 model with solar metallicity and a salpeter imf .",
    "we now find @xmath339 , i.e. , the high-@xmath6 photometric masses have increased by almost a factor of 2 with respect to the photometric masses obtained from the optical seds alone .",
    "this is not the case for the local sample ( @xmath340 ) , which implies that @xmath328 has increased significantly , to @xmath341 .",
    "thus , the normalized high-@xmath6 stellar masses are now a factor of 1.4 larger than the dynamical masses .",
    "a similar increase in @xmath328 is found for the other bc03 ssp models ( see panels a and b of figure [ mmmodels1 ] and table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "for the model with a flat imf this means that @xmath328 is consistent with zero , but we have shown in the previous section that such a model provides a very poor fit to the rest - frame optical colors and @xmath3 .",
    "for the m05 ssp models ( panels c and d of figure [ mmmodels1 ] ) the effect of including the near - ir is very different .",
    "it is still true that the high-@xmath6 photometric masses increase somewhat , but that is also the case for the local sample .",
    "the net effect is that @xmath328 does not change significantly . for the solar metallicity model",
    "we find @xmath342 and for the super - solar metallicity we find @xmath336",
    ".    the most important consequence of the above results is the large difference between the masses inferred from the bc03 and m05 models with the same parameters .",
    "normalized masses at @xmath0 obtained with a bc03 model are 2 - 2.5 times larger than normalized masses obtained with a m05 model .",
    "this implies that there is an intrinsic systematic uncertainty in photometric mass estimates of at least a factor of 2.5 .",
    "we stress that our results are not caused by the different redshifts of the samples : the same rest - frame wavelength is sampled for the low- and high - redshift samples .",
    "the age difference between the samples reveals the systematic problems . in principle",
    ", tests such as described here do not require a range in redshift , but in the local universe there is no suitable sample of relatively simple stellar systems with ages of 1 - 2 gyr and dynamically measured masses .    in figure",
    "[ ml_col]b we show the relation between @xmath246 and @xmath343 for the models and the observed galaxies .",
    "the m05 models reproduce the galaxy colors and @xmath3 better than the bc03 models .",
    "note that in the optical the reverse is the case ( see figure [ ml_col]a ) .",
    "qualitatively , we may understand that extending sed fits to the near - ir does not constrain mass estimates much further : the optical - to - near - ir color ( e.g. , @xmath246 ) does not constrain @xmath3 very well .",
    "reversely , the m05 model , which predicts the lack of strong evolution in @xmath246 can not distinguish well between galaxies with low and high @xmath3 .",
    "as a side - effect , the scatter in @xmath329 is similar to that found when the sed fits are restricted to the optical , a factor of 1.65 - 1.85 for all models described above .",
    "the relatively high masses inferred with the bc03 model for the @xmath0 galaxies are the result of the relatively high near - ir luminosities of the galaxies . according to the model these imply old age and high @xmath3 ( see figures [ age_col ] and [ ml_col ] ) .",
    "another possible explanation for the high near - ir luminosities is the presence of dust - obscured stellar populations that do not contribute to the optical luminosity . generally speaking",
    ", models with more complex star - formation histories might yield younger ages and lower @xmath3 .",
    "we explore models with exponentially declining star - formation rates and models with a dust - obscured , secondary burst of star - formation that occurs @xmath344 after the initial burst .",
    "we adopt a fixed contribution to the stellar mass of the secondary burst and leave age and extinction as free parameters . leaving the secondary burst strength as a free parameter results in a very large scatter in @xmath329 as the three free parameters are degenerate .",
    "if we assume that a secondary burst accounts for 10% of the total stellar mass , we find @xmath345 ( where @xmath324 is taken from the results obtained with the ssp model as the effect of a secondary burst does not affect the seds of the old local early - types ) .",
    "the galaxies responsible for the decrease in @xmath328 typically have a @xmath346 old secondary stellar population that is highly obscured ( @xmath347 ) .",
    "similar results are obtained if the secondary burst strength is increased to 30% ( @xmath348 ) .",
    "models with exponentially declining star - formation rates also improve the results for the bc03 model if we allow for the presence of dust ( @xmath349 ) .",
    "hence , models with a more complex sfh can successfully reproduce the seds of @xmath0 early - type galaxies that yield photometric masses that are consistent with their dynamical masses . also , the quality of the fits is better for the models with more complicated star - formation histories than for the ssp model ( see table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "we note that these type of models do not improve the results for the super - solar metallicity bc03 model ( @xmath350 , see table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "the m05 model fits do not change significantly if a model with a complex star - formation history is used ( @xmath351 , see table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "finally , we explore the effect of extending the analysis to the rest - frame uv .",
    "the uv is strongly affected by ( small traces of ) star - formation , and is expected to cause less accurate mass estimates . on the other hand",
    ", this sensitivity to young stars may allow to constrain the sfh and dust content , which we below adopt as free parameters .    as a baseline",
    ", we adopt the bc03 and m05 ssp models with solar metallicity and a salpeter imf .",
    "we now fit the seds using the @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath219 photometry . because of the problems detailed in the previous section , we omit the rest - frame near - ir .",
    "the results are shown in the left - hand panels of figure [ mmuvbc ] ( bc03 ) and figure [ mmuvm ] ( m05 ) .",
    "the scatter in @xmath329 is a factor of @xmath352 , similar to the scatter obtained without the @xmath215 and @xmath216 photometry .",
    "the quality of the fits has decreased significantly : for the bc03 model , the average @xmath250 is now 0.30 mag ( it is 0.03 mag without the two shortest - wavelength filters ) ; for the m05 model this is 0.24 mag , instead of 0.05 mag .",
    "this indicates that , at least for the uv part of the seds , an ssp model provides poor fits .",
    "now we allow for an exponentially declining star - formation rate with timescale @xmath274 , instead of assuming a single burst .",
    "since star - formation is usually related to extinction by dust , we consequently adopt @xmath306 as a free parameter as well .",
    "the results are shown in the middle and panel of figure [ mmuvbc ] ( bc03 ) and the right - hand panel of figure [ mmuvm ] ( m05 ) .",
    "the scatter in @xmath329 decreases marginally and is now comparable ( a factor of @xmath353 ) to what we found when we excluded the uv and assumed a dust - free ssp . also , the fits are somewhat better , as the average @xmath250 is now @xmath354 for both models .",
    "the fact that the @xmath250 remains much higher than for the optical sed fits is most likely caused by the large errors in the @xmath215-band photometry .    in table",
    "[ tab2 ] we show the average values of age , @xmath274 , and @xmath306 .",
    "the inferred values for the extinction are quite large : @xmath355 for both models",
    ". age and @xmath274 are @xmath356 and @xmath357 for the bc03 model with dust and @xmath358 and @xmath359 for the m05 model with dust .",
    "this implies an average sfr of @xmath360 . assuming that this continues to decline exponentially between the epoch of observation and the present , the average stellar mass increases by no more than @xmath361 after @xmath0 .",
    "the galaxy with the highest sfr would increase its stellar mass by @xmath362 .",
    "the models imply that residual star - formation is not very relevant for the galaxies in our sample , and , barring interactions or mergers , have assembled most of their stellar mass by @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we test a bc03 model in which a dusty , secondary burst of star - formation occurs @xmath344 after the dust - free initial burst .",
    "this is the same model as used in the previous section , but now we adopt the strength of the secondary burst as a free parameter as well , along with age and @xmath306 : we allow the secondary burst to vary in strength between 0% to 30% of the final stellar mass .",
    "the results are shown in the right - hand panel of figure [ mmuvbc ] .",
    "the scatter in @xmath329 is a factor of 1.9 , which is similar to what was found when modeling the rest - frame optical seds with a dust - free ssp model .    to investigate the applicability of the double burst model",
    ", it is more interesting to look at individual galaxies .",
    "the fits of 11 out of 20 galaxies clearly improve by allowing a dusty , secondary burst . with a single burst , these seven galaxies are assigned ages of @xmath363 .",
    "these galaxies are fit significantly better by a @xmath364 old secondary burst involving , on average , @xmath365 of the final stellar mass and an extinction of @xmath366 .",
    "this young population is superimposed on a 2 gyr older , dust - free population .",
    "in this paper we have compared photometric and dynamical masses of early - type galaxies at both high ( @xmath0 ) and low redshifts .",

    "\\1 ) after allowing for a systematic offset , the scatter in @xmath329 , which quantifies the random uncertainty in photometric mass estimates of individual early - type galaxies at @xmath0 , is a factor of @xmath367 ( @xmath368 ) . we find no significantly different random uncertainties for different models and different wavelength ranges used in the fits , i.e. , including irac data in the sed fits does not provide significantly more accurate mass estimates .",
    "\\2 ) for ssp models from bc03 and rest - frame optical sed fits we find that the photometric masses of the @xmath0 galaxies are consistent with the dynamical masses after normalization with respect to the @xmath191 galaxies .",
    "this normalization is the difference between the photometric and dynamical masses of the low-@xmath6 comparison sample .",
    "when the sed fits are extended to the rest - frame near - ir the normalized @xmath0 mass estimates increase by a factor of 2 : the @xmath0 photometric masses are are larger than the dynamical masses . for the ssp model with a top - heavy imf ( @xmath241 instead of @xmath242 )",
    "there is no such discrepancy , but in that case optical sed fits underestimate the @xmath0 masses by a factor of 2.3 .",
    "if we allow for more complex star - formation histories and dust - extinction , the @xmath0 mass estimates decrease , such that the discrepancy seen for the bc03 models with a salpeter imf and solar metallicity disappears .",
    "for example , a model with a secondary , obscured burst of star formation provides good results and increases the quality of the fits .",
    "if correct , these results imply the presence of a significant population ( at least 10% in mass ) of young stars ( @xmath369 ) that are highly obscured ( @xmath347 ) in roughly half of the @xmath0 population .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this is the case .",
    "mid - ir observations will constrain this scenario .",
    "\\3 ) we find very different results when we use the m05 model with solar metallicity .",
    "that model produces normalized mass estimates from the optical seds of the @xmath0 galaxies that are too low by a factor of 1.7 . the most striking difference with the bc03 model is revealed when",
    "the sed fits are extended to the near - ir : the normalized mass estimates at @xmath0 do not change significantly , which implies that the normalized high-@xmath6 mass estimates remain too low .",
    "more complex models do not change these results significantly .",
    "most importantly , the differences between the results obtained with the bc03 and m05 ssp models with identical model parameters imply a systematic uncertainty of a factor of 2.5 in photometric mass estimates obtained from near - ir sed fits . hence , extending sed fits from the optical to the near - ir does not provide better mass estimates of high-@xmath6 early - type galaxies , because of uncertainties intrinsic to the stellar population models .",
    "\\4 ) adopting the sfh and dust - extinction as free parameters , and extending the sed fits to the rest - frame uv , do not increase the quality of the sed fits , nor decrease the random uncertainty in the photometric masses . for our sample , fitting the rest - frame optical seds is optimal to constrain the masses",
    ". fits of uv+optical seds of several individual galaxies , however , improve significantly by adopting the sfh as a free parameter .",
    "the above results demonstrate that both models have problems in either the optical ( m05 ) or the near - ir ( bc03 , barring significant , obscured stellar populations ) .",
    "this conclusion relies on two assumptions .",
    "first , we assume that all local and distant galaxies have similar dynamical structures .",
    "in other words , we assume that invoking @xmath370 as @xmath201 for both low- and high - redshift early - types does not introduce systematic effects .",
    "this assumption appears to be reasonable , as fp studies have shown that all nearby ellipticals and s0s to follow the same relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xcite showed that high redshift ellipticals have the same structure as low redshift ellipticals .",
    "second , we assume that local and distant galaxies can be fit with models with the same metallicity and imf . by",
    "that we ignore , for example , the possibility that the galaxies in our @xmath0 sample evolve strongly in metallicity",
    ". however , in order to remove the inconsistency found for the bc03 model , the distant galaxies would have to be more metal - rich than the local galaxies .",
    "this seems unlikely . on the contrary , @xcite show evidence for metal enrichment between @xmath371 and the present .",
    "we also note that mergers between early - type galaxies , which are likely very important in shaping the mass - function of the early - type galaxy population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , do not affect our conclusions much because the stellar populations themselves do not change .",
    "the differences between the models are not restricted to the range of ages of the galaxies described in this paper ( @xmath372 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the largest differences are found for even younger ages ( i.e. , low @xmath3 , see figures [ age_col ] and [ ml_col ] ) .",
    "this implies that mass estimates of young or star - forming galaxies may also be systematically uncertain .",
    "this is in particular relevant to studies at @xmath373 , where sed fits are the only available method for estimating galaxy masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this work suggests that more than one type of model should be used when performing sed fits , as the difference will give an indication of the systematic uncertainty .",
    "it is essential that the models are improved , hopefully leading to consistent predictions of the seds , given the imf , star formation history and metallicity .",
    "therefore , a better understanding of the near - ir properties of stellar populations is required .",
    "our work provides a new tool to verify the predictions of the models , a method that can be exploited more thoroughly by obtaining a large sample of early - type galaxies with a wide range in redshift , accurate dynamical masses and abundance measurements from spectroscopy , star - formation activity from uv and mid - ir photometry , and mass estimates derived from multi - wavelength imaging , including the rest - frame near - ir .",
    "only when the model discrepancies are resolved can the full potential of irac for measuring stellar masses of distant galaxies be realized ."
