    "one of the main arguments used to explain why quantum mechanics is not easily accessible to most of the students attending for first time a quantum mechanics course , is that the physical situations of quantum mechanics are not everyday life phenomena and that can be approached only through abstract mathematics .",

    "et al._,@xcite some efforts has been done aiming for a comprehensive and easy implementation ( even for beginners in the field ) of numerical methods to solve the schrdinger equation ( see for instance ref .   and references therein ) . yet",
    ", it should be noted that nowadays there are many programs that are able to do such simulations,@xcite but in most cases , those are numerical codes that require more than a basic knowledge of programming to be implemented .",
    "writing a simple program that can be fully implemented by the student allows a better understanding of the phenomenon , opens the possibility of treating a wider range of problems and allows the student to have a pleasant first contact with programming . in this paper",
    "we describe a numerical integration method for the time ",
    "dependent schrdinger equation and the implementation of absorbing boundary conditions and source terms into this scheme . unlike most existing methods,@xcite",
    "this method is easy to implement , versatile , very accurate , and can be implemented without including any kind of matrix inversion package , which allows a fully implementation on a mathematical package such as mathematica , providing easily visualizable results of the evolving system .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ themethod ]",
    "we present a short description of the technique and its numerical implementation .",
    "we follow by presenting the formula for the inverse of a non - symmetrical tridiagonal jacobian matrix and we show how to introduce the inverse matrix formulas into the numerical scheme . in section [ metabc ]",
    "we continue relating it to the absorbing boundary conditions to finally apply it for the case of the source term in section [ metst ] .",
    "we end this paper by comparing our numerical results with the analytical solution for the schrdinger equation with source term to finally compare the analytical and numerical results for the transmission probability of a finite potential barrier .",
    "let us consider the schrdinger equation in atomic units , i.e. @xmath1 , @xmath2 with the hamiltonian given by @xmath3 the idea is to compute the time evolution of the wave function @xmath4 for @xmath5 , given an initial state @xmath6 .",
