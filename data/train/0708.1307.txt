    "coherent population trapping ( cpt ) , electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , electromagnetically induced absorption ( eia ) , sub - recoil laser cooling , lasing without inversion , strong dispersive media , fast and slow light are some examples of physical phenomena resulting from the interaction of light fields with coherently prepared media . + eit is a nonlinear optical effect typically observed in a @xmath0-type three - level atomic system interacting with two electromagnetic fields .",
    "the significant reduction of the medium absorption , occurring near the raman resonance condition , can be understood as the consequence of the existence of a coherent superposition of ground levels ( a dark state ) which is not coupled to the excited state by the fields .",
    "atoms falling in this dark state stay trapped as the electromagnetic field is unable to excite them .",
    "transparency is then induced as a consequence of the optical pumping of the atomic system into this dark state . in consequence ,",
    "eit resonances are commonly designated as dark resonances as we will do in the following .",
    "the width of the dark resonance when the raman detuning is varied is essentially determined by the coherence loss rate of the lower ( ground ) states . in closed @xmath1 systems ,",
    "the optical pumping rate to the dark state defines a lower limit for the resonance width @xcite .",
    "however a quite different behavior is observed for open systems , where the lower limit of the resonance width ( in the absence of other dephasing processes ) appears to be only determined by the interaction time of the atoms with the laser radiation @xcite . for an atomic vapor inside a macroscopic cell the interaction time",
    "is essentially determined by the time of flight of atoms through the laser beam . a buffer gas , resulting in a diffusive atomic motion ,",
    "is frequently used in order to largely increase such a time .",
    "another approach consists in avoiding the atom coherence loss at the walls of the container by using a paraffin coating . in practice",
    ", other factors such as collisions or magnetic field inhomogeneities can result in additional ground state decoherence .",
    "dark resonance spectra in macroscopic cells can be extremely narrow , spectral widths smaller than 50 hz have been measured in buffered cm - long cells @xcite .",
    "+ considerable attention is presently directed to the use of miniaturized atomic cells as practical metrological standards .",
    "dark resonances in miniaturized cells have been used as compact atomic frequency references @xcite and compact magnetometers @xcite . however , in order to obtain narrow resonances with such miniaturized cells , large buffer gas pressures must be used to provide a small enough atomic diffusion lengths .",
    "the use of miniaturized buffer gas cells has the drawback that the dark resonance linewidth grows very fast when the cell characteristic dimension @xmath2 is reduced ( width@xmath3 @xcite ) .",
    "the spectroscopic properties of small size cells can be considerably different than those of larger ones if the cell dimensions are small compared to the mean free path of the atoms in the vapor .",
    "an example of this is given by the linear absorption spectrum of an atomic gas with 1d confinement between two close parallel windows obtained in a thin cell .",
    "in this case the atomic sample becomes anisotropic since atoms flying parallel to the windows interact with light during a much larger time than those flying perpendicular to the windows .",
    "such an anisotropy is responsible for the observation of sub - doppler features in the spectrum @xcite .",

    "intermediate cells , designated as `` micro - metric '' cells @xcite are those for which @xmath7 ( @xmath8 : excited state lifetime ) . in these cells the atom - light interaction time is long compared to the excited state decay which means that several absorption - emission cycles can take place . however",
    ", the optical pumping efficiency is strongly dependent on the atomic velocity and only the slowest atoms may approach a steady state .",
    "finally , nanometric cells are those for which @xmath9 which means that the optical relaxation can be neglected during the atomic flight , the regime is a coherent build - up of the atomic excitation for those cells whose length is typically shorter than the optical wavelength .",
    "+ micro - metric thin cells were used in optical pumping experiments with a single irradiating beam at normal incidence .",
    "the strong dependence of the interaction time with the atomic velocity results in the observation of doppler free absorption spectral lines @xcite .",
    "nano - metric cells have been used to observe the enhancement of the coherent transient atomic response due to dicke narrowing , and to study long - range atom - wall interaction @xcite .",
    "recently , a merging between the domain of eit in miniaturized cells and spectroscopy in anisotropic thin cells , has led to the observation of dark resonances in micro - metric thin cells @xcite and even in nano - metric thin cells @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to describe theoretically the main spectroscopic features of dark resonances in micro - metric thin cells@xcite , with an emphasis on the contribution of slow atoms .",
    "we have chosen to study the properties of dark resonances in micro - metric cells through the analysis of a scheme applicable to the experimental situation of an atomic transition with a lower level with total angular momentum @xmath10 and an excited state with angular momentum @xmath11 interacting with a single linearly polarized optical field propagating along the quantization axis . with the incident field expanded into the components of the two eigen circular polarization components , this system constitutes a realization of a @xmath0 system ( see fig .",

    "interestingly , this standard assumption has been addressed experimentally only seldomly .",
    "experimental data exist from an accurate linear absorption experiment @xcite , where a thermodynamical equilibrium between atoms and surface was expected , and from experiments using molecular beams scattered by planar surfaces @xcite . in this last case ,",
    "the distribution is usually referred as knudsen law , as no thermodynamical equilibrium exists between the incoming particles and the surface . +        according to fig .",
    "[ fig : velosel].b the velocities contributing to the dark resonance spectrum in micro - metric thin cells are much smaller than the optically selected velocity @xmath60 , and are currently well below @xmath161 . for alkali atoms , such as rb or cs",
    ", this corresponds to longitudinal velocities smaller than @xmath162 .",
    "the existence of such slow atoms , necessarily assumed when considering a m - b distribution , is questionable .",
    "for example , even minor effects of surface roughness or imperfections in the wall planarity ( i.e. deviation between the local normal direction , and the global one ) may prohibit the observation of very small velocities at desorption .",
    "in addition , at the limit of very slow velocities , the quantized atomic motion , and the heisenberg uncertainty casts a limit to the minimal velocity if the atomic position is approximately known . in all these cases , and even if collisional redistribution may allow atoms with nearly null @xmath39 velocity between the walls , the transient evolution of the atomic state can no longer be described by a wall - to - wall trajectory .",
    "moreover , atoms leaving the surface at a nearly - grazing incidence undergo a strong van der waals interaction for a long duration , susceptible to deviate their trajectories .",
    "note that such a possible limitation to the description by a m - b distribution , affecting very slow atoms , could not be addressed in the experiments mentioned above for these extremely small velocities .",
    "similarly , in an atomic scattering experiment , an @xmath163 angle relatively to the normal ( i.e. @xmath164 ) is usually an already very large scattering angle .",
    "the present results show the importance of the contribution of slow atoms , both in amplitude and for the lineshape .",
    "hence one understands that dark resonances in thin cells may provide a useful tool to investigate the presence of atoms with ultra - slow normal velocities resulting from a desorption process . to analyze this possibility",
    "we have studied the modifications of the dark resonance spectrum when the slowest atoms are removed from the velocity distribution . in such case ,",
    "the narrow structure of the coherent signal at @xmath165 is correspondingly reduced , the spectrum broadens and changes its shape as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist ] . in the specific case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist ] , obtained for a realistic set of parameters ( @xmath166 , @xmath167 has been used corresponding to experiments with rb or cs @xcite ) , a significant change in the dark resonance spectrum shape and width is already visible when velocities up to @xmath168 are removed from the velocity distribution .",
    "moreover , the changes resulting from the modified velocity distribution are not limited to a change in amplitude and width , that could be hardly identified if one has no possibility to effectively compare the obtained signal with the one predicted for a genuine mb distribution .",
    "rather , it is the overall shape of the signal , notably in the ratio between the wings and the behavior at the center , that are modified .",
    "conversely , in purely optical spectroscopy , the contribution of atoms with ultra - slow velocities , although relatively favored in thin cells @xcite and depending upon the same @xmath61 parameter , remains hindered inside the ( broad ) optical width . here",
    ", the dark resonance scheme introduces extra parameters , finally allowing an rf selectivity in an all - optical measurement .",
    "it is also worth noticing that , although going to long cells is apparently favorable to reduce the width , the sensitivity to low velocity atoms is rather obtained for relatively short cells as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : dist ] .",
    "in summary , we have studied the dark resonances in micro - meter thin cells identifying the relevant physical parameters and discussing the physical mechanisms that determine the shape of the spectra .",
    "we have mostly assumed the irradiation to be on resonance with the atomic transition , but we have shown this is not critical ( within the optical width ) . for large values of the parameter @xmath61 ( corresponding to",
    "relatively long cells and/or high intensities ) narrow dark resonance spectra result from the contribution of all atoms : in spite of the assumption of wall - to - wall trajectory , one hence recovers the results predicted for a macroscopic cell . for small values of @xmath61 ( corresponding to relatively thin micro - metric cells and low intensities ) ,",
    "broader dark resonance spectra are obtained that , nonetheless , should enable an unusual tight velocity selection of ultra - slow atoms .",
    "this differs from single laser beam experiments on a two - level transition , for which the predicted enhanced contribution of slow atoms ( and according to the same parameter @xmath61 ) remains hindered by the optical width @xcite . in our case , it is the eit scheme that allows to benefit of an rf selectivity in an all - optical measurement .",
    "we suggest that dark resonance spectroscopy in thin cells could provide a useful tool for the investigation of the velocity distribution of atoms leaving the surface with grazing trajectories after a desorption process .",
    "this possibility , expected from spectroscopy in thin cell @xcite ( and demonstrated in @xcite down to @xmath169 , as compared to the @xmath170 standard selection associated to the optical width ) , was until now limited by the optical width of the detection method @xcite , but turns here to be realistic with the introduction of the arbitrary narrow raman width as an additional parameter .",
    "other interesting phenomena such as velocity or temperature jumps on a surface @xcite or laser induced desorption @xcite could also possibly be approached with this technique .",
    "the theoretical analysis presented in this work shows a slight dependence on the dark resonance spectral width with the confinement introduced by the thin cell that can notably apply to the consideration of thin cells for the development of compact atomic frequency references @xcite .",
    "finally , experiments related to this work are currently underway on rb or cs , in which inhomegeneities and/or finite transit time impose a practical lower limit for the dark resonance spectral width .",
    "however a spectral width of only @xmath171 have been measured for the hyperfine raman transition of rb in a @xmath172 thin cell @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank financial support from ecos - sud ( contract @xmath173 , france ) and csic ( uruguay ) .",
