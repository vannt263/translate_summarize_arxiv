    "in recent years , the generation and manipulation of nonclassical states of the electromagnetic field have gained much importance in active research in quantum optics and quantum information theory @xcite , in the context of physical realization of quantum tasks , protocols and communications @xcite using continuous quantum variables .",
    "various methods of manipulation at the single - photon level have been suggested for the preparation of nonclassical states of the optical field , based on operations of photon addition ( @xmath1 ) @xcite and subtraction ( @xmath0 ) @xcite on a classical field .",
    "agarwal and tara @xcite first proposed an @xmath4-photon - added scheme to create a nonclassical state from any classical state .",
    "et al _ @xcite demonstrated a single photon - added coherent state by homodyne tomography technology .",
    "a remarkable development has been the experimental realization of a general scheme by zavatta _",
    "et al _ @xcite , based on single - photon interference , for implementing superpositions of distinct quantum operations .",
    "@xcite have recently investigated the nonclassical properties of the field states generated by subtracting any number of photons from a squeezed thermal state .",
    "lee and nha @xcite have studied the action of an elementary coherent superposition of @xmath0 and @xmath1 on continuous variable systems .",
    "we wish to consider a general superposition of the two product ( sup ) operations , @xmath5 on a classical state , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are scalars with @xmath8 . this operation can be realized experimentally under suitable modification of the interference set - up proposed by kim _",
    "et al _ @xcite . the basic unit for photon addition is a twin - photon source based on the nonlinear optical process of parametric down - conversion @xcite .",
    "the nonclassicality in the sup operated states can be quantified and analyzed using quasiprobability distributions in the phase space .",
    "the scalars @xmath6 and @xmath7 act as control parameters for manipulation of the nonclassical character of the output state .",
    "we observe that the sup operation introduces nonclassicality in the classical _ coherent _ state and there is a finite negativity in the wigner distribution which is analyzed for different scalar parameters .",
    "the nonclassical features of the sup operated coherent state can be further analyzed using observable features such as squeezing and sub - poissonian statistics . in case of input _ thermal _",
    "state , no negativity of the wigner function is observed .",
    "the sup operation introduces non - gaussianity in the classical thermal state .",
    "the nonclassical characteristics of the input thermal state is highlighted by its sub - poissonian distribution and squeezing effect .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by outlining a practical sup operation scheme in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "various nonclassicality indicators used in our study are defined in section [ sec3 ] . in section [ sec4 ]",
    ", we present the results on sup operated coherent and thermal states , in terms of the wigner distribution function , a general operator - ordering parametrized quasiprobability function , mandel s @xmath9 parameter and also the quadrature squeezing parameter .",
    "the last section contains a summary of our main results .",
    "the generation of the desired quantum operation , @xmath5 , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the annihilation and the creation operators , respectively , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are scalars with @xmath8 , involves proper sequencing of photon subtraction ( @xmath0 ) and photon addition ( @xmath1 ) operators @xcite , and then coherent superposition of the ordered products by removing which - path information between them .",
    "the schematic of the experimental proposal for the generation of the quantum operation @xmath10 is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "high transmissivity beam - splitters b1 and b2 are used for photon subtraction .",
    "when an input field is incident upon a high transmissivity beam - splitter , with the other input in a vacuum mode , detection of a photon in the photo - detector implies that a photon has been subtracted ( @xmath0 ) from the incident state .",
    "the parametric down - converter ( pdc ) is used to add photons .",
    "a pdc produces twin photons into two different modes .",
    "if an incident field is passed through a pdc , with the other input in a vacuum state , the detection of a photon in the detector would imply that a photon ( the undetected twin ) has been added ( @xmath1 ) to the incident field .",
    "the operation of this optical scheme is dependent on the photo - detectors , p1 , p2 and p3 , which detect the success of the addition or subtraction process in an optical path .",
    "m is a highly reflective mirror .",
    "the variable transmissivity beam - splitter b3 is used to generate the desired superposition of the product states by removing the which - path information .",
    "as shown in the schematic in figure  [ fig1 ] , the input state @xmath11 is incident upon b1 .",
    "the subtraction of a photon at b1 will lead to a photon - subtracted state along path i and a photon along path ii after reflection from m. in the absence of b3 , the photon can be detected at p2 .",
    "no detection at p2 would ensure that no subtraction has taken place at b1 .",
    "the input field then proceeds to the pdc .",
    "the detection of a photon at p1 , along path iii , confirms the addition of a photon due to parametric down - conversion .",
    "hence the simultaneous detection of a photon at p1 and p2 ( in the absence of b3 ) ensures the operation @xmath12 .",
    "the photon - added field then proceeds to b2 .",
    "the subtraction of a photon at b2 leads to a photon subtracted state along path i and a photon along path iv , which would be detected by p3 in the absence of b3 .",
    "hence detection at p1 and p3 ( in the absence of b3 ) , with no detection at p2 @xcite , ensures the operation @xmath13 .",
    "no detection at p3 would ensure that no subtraction has taken place at b2 .",
    "the final output state can either be @xmath12 or @xmath14 depending on the detection at p2 or p3 respectively .",
    "hence , the two paths of detection ii and iv are the two product operation indicators .",
    "the beam - splitter b3 removes this path information , and produces a superposition of the two paths and hence of the two operations .",
    "the generation of the superposed product states can be shown mathematically using standard operators for the various paths involved in the scheme .",
    "if @xmath11 ( mode i ) is incident upon a high transmissivity beam - splitter b1 ( transmissivity , @xmath15 @xmath16 1 ) , with the other input in vacuum mode ( mode ii ) , we obtain @xmath17 the state is now incident upon a pdc with a small coupling constant @xmath18 and the other input in vacuum mode ( iii ) .",
    "the resulting operation can be written as @xmath19 the photon addition occurs only when a photon is created in mode iii at the pdc .",
    "hence the state producing one photon , detected by p1 , corresponds to @xmath20 the state is then incident on the second high transmissivity beam - splitter b2 ( transmissivity , @xmath21 @xmath16 1 ) , with the other input in vacuum mode ( iv ) .",
    "the operation leads to @xmath22 in the absence of beam - splitter b3 , photon detection of mode ii at p2 ( along with detection at p1 and no detection at p3 ) leads to the state @xmath23 and photon detection of mode iv at p3 ( along with detection at p1 and no detection at p2 ) leads to the state @xmath24 .",
    "hence we can obtain the product state @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) using consecutive photon addition ( subtraction ) and subtraction ( addition ) .",
    "finally , we can use the beam - splitter b3 with transmissivity @xmath27 and reflectivity @xmath28 to produce the superposition state .",
    "the operation of the beam - splitter can be represented by the transformations @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) are the input ( output ) modes of the beam - splitter . using the above relations ,",
    "the superposition states we obtain are : @xmath35 @xmath36 which can be conveniently cast in the general form @xmath37 .",

    "the partial negative value of the wigner function is a one - sided condition for the nonclassicality of the related state @xcite , in the sense that one can not conclude the state is classical when the wigner function is positive everywhere .",
    "for example , the wigner function of the squeezed state is gaussian and positive everywhere but it is a well - known nonclassical state . for a classical state , a necessary but not sufficient condition is the positivity of the wigner function .",

    "the nonclassical nature of a positive wigner function can be determined using other features of the state , such as sub - poissonian statistics and quadrature squeezing .",

    "<S> we consider an experimentally realizable scheme for manipulating quantum states using a general superposition of products of field annihilation ( @xmath0 ) and creation ( @xmath1 ) operators of the type ( @xmath2 ) , with @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> such an operation , when applied on states with classical features , is shown to introduce strong nonclassicality . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify the generated degree of nonclassicality by the negative volume of wigner distribution in the phase space and investigate two other observable nonclassical features , sub - poissonian statistics and squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the operation introduces negativity in the wigner distribution of an input coherent state and changes the gaussianity of an input thermal state . </S>",
    "<S> this provides the possibility of engineering quantum states with specific nonclassical features .    </S>",
