    "heavy - flavor measurements in nucleus ",
    "nucleus collisions allow to test theoretical predictions about partonic energy - loss in the hot and ultra - dense strongly - interacting matter that is produced .",
    "results of the heavy - flavor measurements performed by phenix and star at the rhic have shown that the suppression of the heavy - flavor decay electron @xmath3 spectra observed in central au ",
    "au collisions at @xmath1=200  gev is underestimated by model calculations implying for heavy - quarks only in - medium radiative energy losses .",
    "such scenario has been confirmed by the first results delivered after the analysis of data collected in pb ",
    "pb collisions at @xmath1=2.76  tev by the alice experiment at the lhc , where the exclusive reconstruction of open - charm hadrons from their hadronic decays complements the inclusive measurement of electron ( and muon ) spectra .",
    "such findings gave boost to calculations considering the role of collisional energy loss for heavy quarks .",
    "in our framework  @xcite the heavy - quark propagation in qgp is described through a relativistic langevin equation , where the stochastic noise term is expressed in terms of two momentum - dependent transport - coefficients representing the mean squared transverse / longitudinal momentum - change per unit time of the scattered heavy quark .",
    "they are computed through pqcd calculations with resummation of medium effects ( in htl approximation ) for soft collisions .",
    "the langevin simulation tool is embedded in a multi - step setup to calculate heavy - flavor observables in @xmath6 and aa collisions : @xmath7 and @xmath8 quarks are generated using the powheg  @xcite code , implementing pqcd at nlo accuracy , with cteq6 m pdfs as input , followed by parton shower evolution performed with the pythia code  @xcite ( this feature was not present in the previous version of our tool  @xcite .",
    "for aa collisions , eps09  @xcite nuclear corrections to pdfs are employed ; then , heavy quarks are distributed in the transverse plane according to the nuclear overlap function @xmath9 corresponding to the selected impact parameter @xmath8 ; a broadening of the heavy - quark @xmath10-spectra due to an intrinsic-@xmath11 ( in pp ) and to the cronin effect ( in aa ) is also included .",
    "then , only for aa collisions , an iterative procedure is employed to follow the stochastic evolution of the heavy quarks in the plasma until hadronization : the langevin update of the heavy - quark momentum and position is performed at each step according to the local 4-velocity and temperature @xmath12 of the expanding background medium , as provided by relativistic hydrodynamic codes  @xcite .",
    "heavy quarks are made hadronize by sampling different hadron species from @xmath7 and @xmath8 fragmentation fractions extracted from experimental data  @xcite ; this approach neglects , by construction , any possible change in the heavy - flavor hadro - chemistry in aa collisions .",
    "then , hadron momenta are sampled from fragmentation functions ( ff ) calculated in heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet )  @xcite , with a single parameter @xmath13 defined as @xmath14 . in order to evaluate the systematic uncertainties associated to different ff choices , for charmed hadrons we have tested also the values of the @xmath13 parameter fitted in the fonll framework  @xcite to aleph data  @xcite at the lep @xmath0 collider ( i.e. @xmath15 for @xmath16  gev ,",
    "while it amounts to @xmath13=0.2 according its definition in  @xcite ; for bottom fragmentation we tested the functional form proposed by kartvelishvili et al .",
    "@xcite , whose single parameter @xmath17 was fitted in the fonll framework@xcite to aleph  @xcite and sld  @xcite @xmath0 data ( namely @xmath18 for @xmath19  gev ) .",
    "finally , each heavy - quark hadron is forced to decay into electrons with pythia  @xcite , using updated tables of branching ratios based on ref .",
    "@xcite .    for brevity , in the following our setup will be named powlang ( powheg+langevin ) .",
    "as a test of the validity of our setup to make heavy - quark energy loss studies at the lhc , we have checked the consistency of the charm and bottom hadron spectra obtained from powheg ( followed by the pythia parton shower and by the heavy - quark fragmentation tools described above ) with those measured at the lhc in pp collisions at @xmath5=7  tev .",
