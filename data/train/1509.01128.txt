    "one of the most fundamental dimension theoretic questions in geometric measure theory is : _ how does dimension behave under orthogonal projection _ ?",
    "this line of research began with the seminal paper of marstrand from 1954 @xcite , influenced by some earlier work of besicovitch .",
    "one version of marstrand s projection theorem states that if @xmath5 is an analytic set with hausdorff dimension @xmath6 $ ] , then the hausdorff dimension of the orthogonal projection of @xmath7 in almost every direction is @xmath8 , which is as big as it can be . here `",
    "almost every ' refers to lebesgue measure on the interval @xmath9 , with projections parameterised in the obvious way . for the purposes of this paper",
    ", the important thing about this projection theorem is that , no matter what analytic set @xmath5 one considers , the hausdorff dimension of the projections @xmath10 is _ almost surely constant_.    other important notions of dimension include the packing dimension and upper and lower box - counting dimension , see @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of these dimensions under projection is rather more subtle than for the hausdorff dimension , as first demonstrated by jrvenp @xcite .",
    "however , in the mid-1990s it became clear that each of these dimensions is at least _ almost surely constant _ under projection , in the same sense that the hausdorff dimension is .",
    "the precise value of the constant is more complicated than simply @xmath8 , but can be stated in terms of _ dimension profiles _ , see @xcite .",
    "there are also natural higher dimensional analogues of these projection results .",
    "in particular , the higher dimensional analogue of marstrand s theorem , where one considers projections of analytic sets @xmath11 to @xmath12-planes , was proved by mattila in 1975 @xcite . in this setting the almost sure value of the hausdorff dimension is given by @xmath13 and ` almost sure ' refers to the natural invariant measure on the grassmannian manifold @xmath14 , which consists of all @xmath12 dimensional subspaces of @xmath15 .    for more information on the rich and fascinating topic of projections of fractal sets and measures ,",
    "see the recent survey papers @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the assouad dimension is another notion of dimension , which has been very useful as a tool in several disparate areas of mathematics . in recent years",
    "it has been gaining more attention in the setting of fractal geometry and geometric measure theory . as such",
    ", it is natural to consider the fundamental geometric properties of the assouad dimension , such as its behaviour under orthogonal projections .",
    "we recall the definition here , but refer the reader to @xcite for more details . for any non - empty subset @xmath16 and @xmath17 , let @xmath18 be the smallest number of open sets with diameter less than or equal to @xmath19 required to cover @xmath20 .",
    "the _ assouad dimension _ of a non - empty set @xmath21 is then given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the open euclidean ball centred at @xmath24 with radius @xmath25 .",
    "it is well - known that the assouad dimension is always an upper bound for the hausdorff dimension .    in this paper",
    "we prove that , unlike the hausdorff , packing and box dimensions discussed above , the assouad dimension of orthogonal projections of a compact set @xmath26 need _ not _ be almost surely constant as a function of the projection angle .",
    "however , in analogy with the result for hausdorff dimension , the essential infimum of the said function is at least @xmath27 ; even if @xmath7 is not compact , or even analytic .",
    "these results are discussed in section [ maingeneral ] .",
    "we establish the non - constancy result via a detailed study of the assouad dimensions of projections of planar self - similar sets .",
    "the hausdorff dimension of projections of self - similar sets has attracted a lot of attention in recent years , see section [ sssection ] , and thus it is natural to consider the analogous questions for assouad dimension . our results for self - similar sets are discussed in detail in section [ mainresults ] , and the applications concerning non - constancy and falconer s theorem ( mentioned in the abstract ) will be presented in sections [ nomarstrand ] and [ nofalconer ] respectively . on route to proving our main result for self - similar sets , we obtain new information about the assouad dimension of graph - directed self - similar sets in the line with overlaps , theorem [ gdassouad ] , which is the natural extension of ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.3 ) to the graph - directed setting and is of independent interest .",
    "many questions remain unanswered by the results in this paper , and we pose some of them in sections [ maingeneral ] through [ selfaffinesets ] . in particular , very little is known for self - affine sets , and in higher dimensions .",
    "self - similar sets are arguably the most fundamental class of fractal set and have been studied extensively , see @xcite .",

    "a @xmath38 orthogonal matrix and @xmath39 is a translation . a fundamental result of hutchinson @xcite states that there is a unique attractor of the iterated function system ( ifs ) @xmath28 , that is , a unique non - empty compact set @xmath40^d$ ] satisfying @xmath41 the set @xmath7 is called self - similar and often has a rich fractal structure .",
    "a self - similar set satisfies the open set condition ( osc ) ( for a given ifs defining it ) if there exists a non - empty open set @xmath42^d$ ] such that @xmath43 with the sets @xmath44 pairwise disjoint .",
    "if @xmath7 satisfies the osc , then its hausdorff and assouad dimensions are given by @xmath45 where @xmath3 is the _ similarity dimension _ given by solving the equation @xmath46 if the osc is not satisfied , then the dimensions are more difficult to get hold of and indeed the assouad and hausdorff dimensions may be distinct @xcite .",
    "one still expects the hausdorff dimension to be given by @xmath45 , unless there is a good reason for it not to be , such as exact overlaps in the construction , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* question 2.6 ) .",
    "recent major advances were made in this area by hochman @xcite .",
    "there has also been intense interest in the dimension theory of the projections of self - similar sets in recent years , see the survey @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have the following theorem :    [ hausdorffprojection ] let @xmath47^d$ ] be a self - similar set containing at least two points , suppose that the group generated by @xmath48 is dense in @xmath49 or @xmath50 and fix @xmath51 less than @xmath52 .",
    "then @xmath53 for _ * all * _ @xmath54 .",
    "the particular interest of this result is that ` dense rotations ' guarantees that there are _ no _ exceptions to marstrand s theorem .",
    "this result is essentially due to hochman and shmerkin s breakthrough work @xcite , although they stated the result assuming some separation conditions .",
    "these conditions were explicitly removed by farkas @xcite and falconer - jin @xcite .",
    "the result in the planar case was obtained earlier by peres and shmerkin @xcite .",
    "we parameterise orthogonal projections onto lines in @xmath55 by @xmath56 in the natural way , by letting @xmath57 be the projection onto the line @xmath58 passing through the origin and forming an angle @xmath59 with the positive @xmath24-axis . with this notation , our main result for general sets is the following :    [ maintheoremforgeneralsets ] assume that @xmath26 .",
    "then , for almost all @xmath56 , @xmath60    theorem [ maintheoremforgeneralsets ] will be proved in section [ proofforgeneralsets ] .",
    "the lower bound is obviously sharp , and in section [ nomarstrand ] we demonstrate by example that the inequality can not be replaced by an equality : the function @xmath61 need not be almost surely constant , and it can attain both the values @xmath62 and @xmath4 for a set of @xmath59 s with positive measure .",
    "we do not know if other values are possible here , or if there can be three distinct values :    given a set @xmath26 , how many distinct values can the assouad dimension of @xmath63 assume for a set of @xmath59 s with positive measure ? if there are only two such values , are they always @xmath62 and @xmath4 ?      in this section we state our main results for self - similar sets , which are rather complete in the context of assouad dimension .",
    "in the @xmath64-dimensional setting the groups @xmath65 and @xmath66 are particularly simple : @xmath65 consists of counterclockwise rotations by angles @xmath67 and the corresponding reflections with orientation reversed and @xmath66 just consists of the rotations . as such",
    ", the group generated by @xmath48 will be dense if and only if one of the @xmath68 rotates by an irrational multiple of @xmath69 and otherwise it will be discrete ( in fact finite ) .",
    "here is the main result for self - similar sets :    [ assouadprojection ] let @xmath70 be self - similar set containing at least two points , and first suppose that the group generated by @xmath48 is discrete .",
    "then , for a given @xmath56 , we have :    1 .   if @xmath71 , then @xmath72 2 .   if @xmath73 , then @xmath74 .",

    "then @xmath75 for * all * @xmath56 .    the discrete rotations case of theorem [ assouadprojection ] will be proved in section [ discreterotationsproof ] and the dense rotations case will be proved in section [ denserotationsproof ] .",
    "we emphasise that we assume no separation conditions for @xmath7 , in particular the osc may fail and the hausdorff dimension of @xmath7 may be strictly smaller than the similarity dimension . by marstrand s theorem",
    ", we have that , for almost all @xmath76 , @xmath77 , but farkas ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.2 ) showed that in the discrete rotations case there is always at least one direction @xmath76 where the dimension drops , i.e. @xmath78 , provided the hausdorff dimension of @xmath7 is given by the similarity dimension and this value is less than or equal to 1 . in the dense rotations case erolu @xcite and farkas (",
    "* theorem 1.5 ) proved that @xmath79 for all @xmath56 .",
    "so , the dichotomy seen in the ` discrete rotations ' part persists for dense rotations , but case _ 1 .",

    "the assouad dimension of @xmath63 is constant and independent of the dimension of @xmath7 .",
    "neither of these phenomena are generally manifest in the discrete case , but one can always find _ at least one _ direction @xmath59 for which the assouad dimension of @xmath63 attains the maximal value of 1 , independent of the dimensions of @xmath7 , provided @xmath7 is not contained in a line .",
    "[ assouadprojectionexamples ] let @xmath47 ^ 2 $ ] be a self - similar set , which is not contained in a line .",
    "then there exists @xmath56 such that @xmath80    we will prove theorem [ assouadprojectionexamples ] in section [ assouadprojectionexamplesproof ] .",
    "our key application of theorem [ assouadprojection ] is that , unlike the hausdorff , upper and lower box , and packing dimensions , the assouad dimensions of orthogonal projections of a ( compact ) set are not almost surely constant in general .",
    "thus , we do not have a ` marstrand s projection theorem for assouad dimension ' .",

    "the restriction to @xmath85 in theorem [ mainex ] may well be an artefact of our method , but at present we are unaware how to construct lower - dimensional examples :    given any @xmath86 , in particular @xmath87 , can one construct a compact planar set with hausdorff dimension @xmath3 , for which the assouad dimension of the projections is not almost surely constant ?    also , we do not know if the words ` almost all @xmath88 ' could be strengthened to ` all @xmath88 ' with a different construction :    can one construct a compact planar set for which the assouad dimension of the projection takes different values on two sets with non - empty interior ?    note that theorem [ mainex ] demonstrates the apparently strange property that assouad dimension can increase under projection ( a lipschitz map ) , which can not happen for the dimensions discussed in section 1 .",
    "this peculiarity of the assouad dimension was observed previously in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.1 ) .    the rest of this section will be dedicated to constructing an example with the properties required by theorem [ mainex ] .",
    "the set @xmath7 will actually be very simple : it will be a self - similar modification of the sierpiski triangle , where the contraction ratios are equal to @xmath89 , see figure 1 .",
    "fix @xmath89 and let @xmath90 be the self - similar attractor of the ifs on @xmath29 ^ 2 $ ] given by @xmath91 . observe that @xmath90 satisfies the _ open set condition _ ( osc ) and so @xmath92 .",

    "self - affine sets are closely related to self - similar sets , but the contractions in the defining ifs can be affine , i.e. @xmath110 can be replaced with any contracting invertible @xmath38 matrix .",
    "this means that the scaled copies of the attractor can scale by different amounts in different directions , as well as being skewed or sheared , which makes them much more difficult to study .",
    "even if the osc is satisfied , the dimensions may be hard to compute and the assouad , box and hausdorff dimensions may all be distinct . despite this",
    ", falconer proved that the hausdorff and box dimensions are ` generically ' equal to the _ affinity dimension _ ; the self - affine analogue of the similarity dimension .",
    "the affinity dimension depends only on the linear parts of the defining maps ( as with the similarity dimension ) and falconer proved that for lebesgue almost all choices of translation vectors @xmath111 , the box and hausdorff dimensions of the corresponding self - affine set are equal to the affinity dimension , provided the spectral norms of the matrices were all strictly less than 1/2 .",
    "in fact , falconer s original proof required 1/3 here , but solomyak relaxed this assumption to 1/2 and pointed out that this was optimal @xcite . also the affinity dimension is always an upper bound for the hausdorff and box dimensions , but this is not true for the assouad dimension @xcite .",
    "specialising to the case of self - similar subsets of the line ( which is a very restrictive class of self - affine sets ) , the assumption on norms is not required . in particular , we have the following result due to simon and solomyak @xcite :    [ ssfalconer ] fix a set @xmath112 with each @xmath113 and let @xmath3 be the corresponding similarity ( affinity ) dimension given by @xmath114 for a given set of translations @xmath115 with @xmath116 , let @xmath117 denote the self - similar attractor of the ifs @xmath118 .",

    "again , this lemma is almost trivial since we are not concerned with losing any dimension .",
    "since @xmath7 is not contained in a line , we may choose finite words @xmath594 such that the fixed points of @xmath595 are not collinear .",
    "each of these maps has an orthogonal component with finite order and so taking @xmath12 to be the lowest common multiple of these orders , the maps @xmath596 all have trivial orthogonal component .",
    "since the fixed points of these three maps are not collinear , we may choose @xmath597 sufficiently large to guarantee that there are no triples @xmath598 such that @xmath599 are collinear .",

    "first we need a suitable notion of convergence for compact sets , which is given to us by the hausdorff metric .",
    "let @xmath620 denote the set of all compact subsets of @xmath15 , which is a complete metric space when equipped with the hausdorff metric @xmath621 defined by @xmath622 where @xmath623 is the hemimetric defined by @xmath624    [ pseudoweaktangent ] let @xmath625 and suppose there exists a sequence of similarity maps @xmath626 such that @xmath627 as @xmath349 .",
