    "hypervelocity stars ( hvss ) are defined as stars able to escape the gravitational well of the milky way ( mw ) . theoretically predicted by @xcite as the consequence of interactions of binary stars with the massive black hole ( bh ) in the galactic centre ( gc ) , hvss were first observed by @xcite .",
    "more then @xmath5 hvss at distances between @xmath6 and @xmath7 kpc from the gc , and velocities up to @xmath8 km s@xmath9 , have been found ( multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) spectroscopic survey @xcite )",
    ". the mmt targets stars with the magnitudes and colors of @xmath10 m@xmath2 late b - type stars , since they should not exist at faint magnitudes in the outer halo far from star - forming regions unless they were ejected to that location .",
    "given the mmt target selection , the sample stars could be either main sequence ( ms ) b stars , evolved blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars or blue stragglers , while only a few of them have a defined stellar type .",
    "recent studies have started to investigate low - mass hvs candidates @xcite .",
    "the physical mechanisms responsible for the production of the observed hvss are still debated . however , due to their extreme velocities , the origin of hvss involves strong dynamical interactions probably with a single or binary bhs in the gc @xcite or in a nearby galaxy @xcite .",
    "the study of hvss can provide clues about the process responsible for their production in the galactic centre region @xcite . as their orbits are completely determined by the mw potential , @xcite and @xcite suggested to use the kinematics of hvss to probe the galactic potential triaxiality .",
    "moreover , hvss can be used to constrain the mass distribution of our galaxy , which is still highly uncertain .",
    "@xcite used the mmt sample to constrain the galactic mass profile out to @xmath11 kpc . in this paper",
    "we apply the method proposed by @xcite to discriminate among different galactic potential models , with a focus on measuring the total dark halo mass .",
    "a variety of techniques have been employed for determining the mw dark matter halo mass distribution , but , nevertheless , the range of allowed values spans both light ( @xmath12 m@xmath2 ) and heavy ( @xmath13 m@xmath2 ) values .",
    "several classes of kinematic tracers , such as tidal streams and globular clusters , have been used for this purpose , but suffer from systematics caused by the lack of reliable tangential velocity and distance measurements @xcite . knowing the precise mass of our galaxy is important for placing the mw in a cosmological @xmath14cdm context .",
    "although the difference in mass between light and heavy halo masses is just by a factor of @xmath15 , such a factor leads to a major difference in the efficiency conversion of baryons into stars ( higher for lighter haloes ) , places the large magellanic cloud and the leo i dwarf spheroidal on unbound ( light halo ) or bound ( heavy halo ) orbits and can or can not solve the too - big - to - fail problem @xcite .",
    "this latter problem is one of the two prominent challenges concerning the satellite galaxies in the mw and consists in the fact that the most massive subhaloes of numerical simulations , which in typical galaxy formation models would host the most luminous satellites , are too dense to be dynamically consistent with observations of any of the known mw companions @xcite .",
    "the other challenge is the so - called missing satellite problem , as @xmath14cdm model predicts hundred of subhaloes but a smaller set of galaxies is observed @xcite .",
    "several possible solutions have been suggested , including uncertainties in the mass of the mw halo @xcite .    in this paper , we study the kinematics of hvss in the galaxy as a probe of the mw halo mass .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe the method we use to discriminate among different halo masses . in section 3 , we perform numerical simulations of hvss motion to study their kinematics and provide results .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "theoretical calculations by @xcite suggest that the hvss ejection rate , both in case the source at the gc is a single or a binary bh , is @xmath16 yr@xmath9 . if hvss ejections are continuous and isotropic , their number density is @xcite @xmath17 implying that hvss are rare objects .",
    "the mmt survey @xcite targeted stars luminous enough to be observed in the galactic halo where the relative number of hvss is expected to be higher .",
    "@xcite found evidence for a very steep outer halo density profile , implying that the relative frequency of hvss is much higher in the outer halo than in the inner halo .",
    "moreover , at galactic latitudes @xmath18 , the survey is less likely to be contaminated by the disk and runaway stars @xcite .",
    "we assume that hvss are ejected from the gc @xcite , and escape the mw if the ejection velocity @xmath19 is higher than the local escape speed @xmath20 , which depends on the galactic potential .",
    "while unbound stars will leave the mw , bound stars will reach the apocentre of their orbit and then return back to the gc with a negative radial velocity @xcite .",
    "the observations reveal a significant asymmetry in the tail of the velocity distribution of the sample stars .",
    "in particular , there is a significant lack of stars with @xmath21 km s@xmath9 in galactocentric coordinates @xcite .",
    "we divide the stars of the sample to outgoing stars with positive radial velocities in galactocentric coordinates , and ingoing stars with negative radial velocities .",
    "@xcite proposed a method that uses the observed asymmetry between ingoing and outgoing stars to discriminate among different galactic potential models .",
    "such asymmetry originates both from the mw gravitational potential as well as from the finite lifetime of hvss .",
    "bound stars can be spotted either as outgoing stars or ingoing stars , according to when they are observed in their orbit @xcite .",
    "however , unbound hvss can be observed only as outgoing .",
    "therefore , an asymmetry in the distribution of ingoing and outgoing stars is expected if hvss are continuously ejected from the gc @xcite .",
    "whereas bound stars are expected to be symmetrically divided between ingoing and outgoing stars , unbound hvss can have only positive velocities .",
    "furthermore , while unbound hvss are not limited in ejection velocity , except for the limitations of the assumed ejection model , the bound stars must satisfy @xmath22 . at a given galactocentric distance @xmath23 ,",
    "ingoing stars can be observed with a negative velocity whose amplitude is at maximum @xmath20 , which depends on the galactic gravitational potential . as consequence , for a given mw model , no ingoing stars are expected to be found below the curve @xmath24 in the v - r plane .",
    "therefore , the asymmetric distance - velocity distribution can be used to directly constrain the galactic potential @xcite .",
    "however , some stars may disappear from view because they evolve to a different stellar type @xcite .",
    "for example , the finite lifetime of ms stars @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , implies that massive stars ejected from the gc can not reach large galactocentric distances and fall back toward the gc before leaving the ms @xcite .",
    "the mmt targeted stars that could be late - type ms b stars with masses in the range @xmath10 m@xmath2 , for which the maximum travel time would be @xmath27 yr @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry in the velocity - distance distribution is still expected but the cutoff @xmath28 will also depend on the finite travel time .",
    "moreover , stars of different types have different travel times and will lead to distinct distance - velocity cutoffs , providing independent probes of the galactic potential @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "different galactic potential models give different @xmath20 , which , combined together with different travel times , lead to peculiar cutoffs in the v - r plane . in this paper",
    "we apply the method proposed by @xcite to current data on halo stars , with a focus on measuring the dark halo mass . we draw critical lines for hvss both as function of the dark halo mass @xmath29 and of the stars travel time @xmath30 , and compare the asymmetric distribution of stars @xmath31 to the number of hvss @xmath32 , defined as the number of stars beyond the local escape speed , to constrain the mw mass . given @xmath32 for @xmath33 m@xmath34",
    ", the @xcite data suggests that the number of @xmath10 m@xmath2 hvss is @xmath35 over the entire sky within @xmath36 kpc .",
    "whereas @xcite look for the best fit model that shows the largest asymmetry , we consider the one that gives compatible @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "as described in the previous section , hvss data can be used to constrain the mw potential .",
    "we describe the mw potential with a 4-component model @xmath37 @xcite , including the potential of the central bh @xmath38 where @xmath39 m@xmath2 , the bulge @xmath40 where @xmath41 m@xmath2 and @xmath42 kpc , the disk @xmath43 where @xmath44 m@xmath2 , @xmath45 kpc and @xmath46 kpc , and the dark matter halo @xmath47    while the parameters of the baryonic components ( bh+bulge+disk ) of the potential are kept fixed , the mass parameter ( not to be confused with the total halo mass ) of the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) dark halo @xmath29 @xcite is varied in the range @xmath48-@xmath49 . the scale radius @xmath50 changes accordingly so that the galactic circular velocity at sun s distance ( @xmath51 kpc ) would be @xmath52 km s@xmath9 @xcite , while the virial radius @xmath53 is defined as the radius within which the enclosed average density is @xmath54 times the mean matter density in the universe .",
    "the concentration is defined as @xmath55 ; see table 1 for the cases under consideration .",
    ".parameters of mw nfw dark halo [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]",
    "we use the publicly available mmt data on halo stars ( table 1 of @xcite , with distances estimated for bhb stars ) , updated by @xcite for stars with @xmath56 km s@xmath9 .",
    "it is important to note that stellar type plays a crucial role since the distances can be inferred only once the luminosities of the observed stars are known . to estimate luminosities and masses ,",
    "the fitted stellar atmosphere parameters need to be compared to theoretical star tracks .",
    "such a comparison can be done once the stellar type is assumed . as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the cutoff in the distance - velocity distribution depends not only on the galactic potential , but also the travel time , which depends on the stellar type . for ms stars ,",
    "@xmath30 is directly related to the star mass @xmath57 by @xmath25 , with @xmath26 .",
    "however , only few stars of the sample have a defined stellar type .",
    "for example , hvss in the mmt survey are probably all ms b stars based on stellar rotation @xcite .",
    "future identification of hvss types will improve the constraint on the halo mass .",
    "since @xmath28 has a two parameter dependence , we have to fix either the propagation time @xmath30 or @xmath29 in order to draw critical lines in the v - r plane .",
    "figure 1 shows the critical lines for different halo masses and propagation times , along with the distribution in the v - r plane of the stars in the mmt sample .",
    "the critical lines show a clear dependence on @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the top figure shows the dependence on the halo mass , if @xmath58 myr for all the stars .",
    "the zero - velocity point , i.e. the distance at which @xmath28 crosses the x - axis , is an increasing function of the halo mass . in order to interpret these results , let us consider two different halo masses @xmath59 and a bound hvs .",
    "once the baryonic content is fixed , @xmath60 . as consequence , @xmath61 and bound hvss can be produced in the gc with a higher ejection velocity , since they have to satisfy the constraint @xmath22 .",
    "since @xmath62 is fixed by the stellar type , stars ejected in a galaxy with @xmath63 are able to reach farther and fall back toward the gc in a shorter time , given their possible higher ejection velocities . given that , the zero - velocity point is located at larger galactocentric distances for heavier haloes . on the other hand ,",
    "the shape of the critical lines depends also on the maximum hvs travel time .",
    "the bottom panel of fig.1 shows the dependence on @xmath30 , if the halo mass is fixed to @xmath64 m@xmath2 .",
    "the zero - velocity point is an increasing function of the propagation time since stars are able to reach farther in their galactic orbits within a longer @xmath30 , before returning back to the gc with negative radial velocity . as discussed in the previous section , for ms stars the propagation time",
    "is directly related to the mass @xmath65 , with @xmath66 .",
    "hence low - mass ms stars are able to reach larger distances in the galactic halo within the ms lifetime , before returning back to the gc with negative radial velocity , compared to massive ms stars .",
    "km s@xmath9 @xcite . ]",
    "hvss should present an asymmetric distribution .",
    "although the clear cutoff in the distribution can be contaminated by the hot bhb stars of the sample , a statistical asymmetry between the number of ingoing and outgoing stars is still expected @xcite .",
    "the distribution of background halo stars is however predicted to be symmetric in the v - r plane @xcite .",
    "we can search for the asymmetry @xmath31 in the mmt stars sample by counting the number of stars beyond @xmath67 and below @xmath28 for the different @xmath29 and @xmath30 . whereas inside the region defined by these two boundaries the distribution of stars should be symmetric , outside of it an asymmetry is expected because of the stars finite lifetime and the mw potential .",
    "we vary @xmath29 in the range of @xmath68-@xmath69\\times 10^{12}$ ] m@xmath2 and @xmath62 in the range of @xmath70-@xmath71 $ ] myr . since hvss in the mmt survey are probably all ms b stars based on stellar rotation @xcite , we chose the travel time interval since it corresponds to the full range of the possible ms masses ( @xmath10 m@xmath2 ) for the mmt hvss . for a fixed halo mass ,",
    "we compute @xmath31 for each value of @xmath30 .",
    "each halo mass allows a minimum value propagation time @xmath72 , before which @xmath73 .",
    "negative values of @xmath31 mean that the sample does not include hvss and our method to constrain the halo mass can not be applied . in our calculations",
    ", we assume that all the stars have a maximal travel time @xmath30 .",
    "this corresponds to the maximum travel time from the gc and determines , along with @xmath29 , the shape of the critical lines .",
    "in order to decide if a star lies below or beyond such lines , we computed error bars for distances and velocities from the data and generate 100 random realizations inside the error bars .",
    "we take into account the fact that distances of mmt sample stars have large uncertainties , since they depend on the assumed absolute magnitude and stellar type .",
    "figure 3 shows the resulting @xmath31 for different halo masses as a function of @xmath30 . for the maximum",
    "allowed propagation time ( @xmath74 myr ) , the initial value of @xmath31 is @xmath75 for all halo masses .",
    "moreover , each curve has a typical peak at a different propagation time @xmath76 , which is a decreasing function of @xmath29 . as mentioned above",
    ", every curve allows a minimum value @xmath72 , which is also a decreasing function of @xmath29 , before which @xmath31 becomes negative and our method can not be applied .",
    "the horizontal lines in fig.3 show the number of hvss , @xmath32 , computed for different halo masses .",
    "@xmath32 depends on the assumed galactic potential . by definition ,",
    "a star is considered as hvs if its galactocentric velocity exceeds the local escape velocity at its galactocentric distance . since @xmath60 ,",
    "different halo masses give different number of stars beyond the local escape velocity , with more massive haloes predicting a lower number of hvss .",
    "figure 2 shows the escape velocity curves for different @xmath29 along with the mmt sample stars with @xmath56 km s@xmath9 . in order to decide",
    "if a star lies below or beyond @xmath77 , we generate 100 random realizations inside the error bars region in the v - r plane to take into account the uncertainties in stellar distances .",
    "unlike @xmath31 , the value of @xmath32 depends only on the assumed gravitational potential , and hence on @xmath29 in our model . however , these two quantities must be compatible , otherwise they would give different estimations of the number of hvss in the galaxy .",
    "the asymmetry in the velocity - distance distribution is due to only outgoing unbound stars because bound stars and halo stars are symmetrically distributed @xcite .",
    "hence , such asymmetry should correspond to the number of hvss in the sample , which is in turn found by computing how many stars are beyond the local escape velocity . with that said ,",
    "the favourite model is the one for which @xmath31 and @xmath32 are comparable , within their error bars .",
    "as demonstrated above , the asymmetry has a two dimensional dependence on @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which gives two possible interpretations depending on whether we fix the halo or the travel time . by fixing the halo mass we can estimate the preferred value of the travel time . as a consequence , since hvss",
    "are probably ms stars and @xmath65 , we could evaluate the preferred mass of hvss . on the other hand , by fixing the mass of the hvss , we can constrain @xmath29 .",
    "for example , if the travel time of hvss is fixed to @xmath0 myr , which corresponds to the average value for the range of possible ms hvss masses ( @xmath1 m@xmath2 ) , the nfw halo mass parameter @xmath29 is constrained to @xmath48-@xmath78 , which gives a favored mass for the milky way in the range @xmath3-@xmath4 inside the virial radius @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the mmt halo stars data ( without including the outliers in the sample , i.e. the hvss ) to derive the galactic circular velocity and the mw mass distribution . adopting a three - component galactic potential @xcite",
    ", they found that the @xcite data suggest a virial mass @xmath79 at the virial radius @xmath80 kpc .",
    "our inferred mw mass range is consistent with the @xcite results and recent independent determinations @xcite .",
    "our results can be improved with better data on the mass and 3d velocity of hvss .",
    "the tracers we studied suffer from the lack of tangential velocity measurements since the mmt survey is a spectroscopic survey",
    ". however , the european mission _ gaia _ ( http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia ) will be able to provide data also for proper motions , and hence tangential velocities , for some of the stars we considered .",
    "we have used the kinematics of hvss as a method to constrain the mw mass .",
    "we studied the kinematics of hvss observed by the mmt survey @xcite in the galactic halo .",
    "the asymmetric velocity - distance distribution of the observed stars depends both on their lifetimes and the mw potential .",
    "we have found that , if the travel time of hvss is fixed to @xmath0 myr , which corresponds to the average value for the range of possible ms hvss stars masses , the halo mass parameter is constrained to the range @xmath48-@xmath81 , which gives a favored mass for the milky way in the range @xmath3-@xmath4 inside the virial radius @xmath53 .",
